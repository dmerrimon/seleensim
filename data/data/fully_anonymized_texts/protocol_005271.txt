Compare pre-post health insurance status, primary care, mental health, and dental visits, and receipt of preventive services, as well as changes in payer mix among ADVANCE CHCs in states that did and did not expand Medicaid.  Hypothesis 1a: CHCs in expansion states will experience an increase in overall visits and visits paid by [CONTACT_5556], relative to non-expansion states. Hypothesis 1b: The percentage of Medicaid visits in CHCs' overall payer mix will increase more significantly in expansion-states relative to non-expansion states.   Aim 2. Examine pre-post utilization of CHC services (including receipt of preventive services) by [CONTACT_85429]. Hypothesis 2: Newly insured patients will have a significant increase in overall CHC visits compared to (a) already insured and (b) uninsured patients.   Aim 3: Measure pre-post changes in overall utilization of healthcare services and Oregon Medicaid expenditures among newly insured compared to already insured patients. 
 5 Hypothesis 3a: There will be an increase in utilization of CHC services and a decrease in use of services external to the CHCs (e.g., emergency department) for newly insured patients, but these utilization rates will remain the same for already insured patients. Hypothesis 3b: There will be an initial increase, then plateau, in overall Medicaid expenditures among newly insured relative to already insured patients.   Data Sources ADVANCE EHR Data. We used electronic health record (EHR) data from the Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center Network (ADVANCE) clinical data research network (CDRN) data warehouse. The ADVANCE CDRN is a unique ‘community laboratory’ for research with underrepresented populations that includes patients receiving care in safety net clinics. The ADVANCE CDRN data warehouse includes integrated longitudinal EHR data from several organizations. Data from two ADVANCE partners, OCHIN and Health Choice Network (HCN), were used in the PACE study. From the ADVANCE CDRN, we included CHC members ‘live’ on their EHR as of January 1, 2013: 225 primary care CHCs in 10 states that expanded Medicaid as of 1/1/2014 ([LOCATION_004], Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin) and 134 primary care CHCs in 6 non-expansion states ([LOCATION_012], Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, [LOCATION_007], Montana). We included Wisconsin as an expansion state because although they did not expand Medicaid to 138% FPL they opened enrollment to adults with eligibility criteria of 100% FPL and therefore behaved more like an expansion state. Montana did not expand Medicaid until after our study period (expanded 1/1/2016), which included a one-year pre- (1/1/13-12/31/13) and a two-year post-period (1/1/2014-12/31/2015). Analyses included >4 million ambulatory visits among patients aged 19-64 (expansion states: 2.6 million visits from 499,719 patients; non-expansion states: 1.5 million visits from 370,600 patients).  Linkage between EHR and Medicaid administrative data. Oregon Medicaid administrative data was linked to OCHIN Oregon clinics in the ADVANCE CDRN to assess the receipt of healthcare services outside the Oregon CHCs and all healthcare expenditures.  Study Population and Study Period The overall study population was adults ages 19-64 throughout the study period, 2012-2015. Included patients had ≥1 ambulatory visit at an eligible facility in the study period. Included facilities provided adult primary care and were ‘live’ on OCHIN’s or HCN’s EHR system by [CONTACT_85430] (1/1/2012). EHR data were extracted on all eligible patients, encounters, and facilities.  Overall, study analyses included >4 million ambulatory visits among patients aged 19-64 (expansion states: 2.6 million visits from 499,719 patients; non-expansion states: 1.5 million visits from 370,600 patients).   
 6 We examined differences in utilization among patients newly gaining Medicaid coverage (newly insured), as compared to utilization among individuals who are already insured by [CONTACT_5556] (already insured) and those who remain uninsured (uninsured). Additionally, in subpopulation analyses restricted to the state of Oregon (an expansion state), we link EHR data from Oregon CHC clinics to Oregon’s Medicaid administrative claims data to investigate post-expansion overall healthcare utilization and Medicaid expenditures among the newly insured as compared to the already insured. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were modified for some analyses; see below for details on specific paper analyses.   Table 2.

Oregon Medicaid Expenditures After the [ADDRESS_93120] Medicaid Expansion: Over-time Differences Among New, Returning, and Continuously Insured Enrollees. Med Care, 56(5), 394-402.  Objective To assess health care expenditures among Medicaid enrollees in the 24 months after Oregon’s 2014 Medicaid expansions and examine whether expenditure patterns were different among the newly, returning, and continuously insured. Study Population Oregon adult Medicaid beneficiaries insured continuously from 2014 to 2015 who were either newly, returning, or continuously insured. Exclusion Criteria Our study population included adults aged 19-64 insured by [CONTACT_85432] 2014 through December 2015. We excluded patients without coverage on 1/1/[ADDRESS_93121] (e.g. pregnant women). Of 622,513 adults aged 19-64 with any 2014 Medicaid enrollment, 230,602 (37%) remained in our sample. Independent Variables Insurance group, time, and their interaction terms, mean monthly expenditures. Dependent Variables standardized expenditures for inpatient care, prescription drugs, and total outpatient care in addition to subdivisions of outpatient: outpatient claims were classified as either emergency department, dental, mental and behavioral health, primary care evaluation, management, and procedures, specialist evaluation, management, and procedures, and primary care/specialist imaging or tests based on a hierarchical system involving procedure code, provider type, provider specialty, place of service, and associated costs. Covariates The patient’s age, sex, racial and ethnic background, rural setting, and comorbidity level as assessed by [CONTACT_85433]. Analysis Plan Retrospective cohort study using inverse-propensity weights to adjust for differences between groups. We summarized enrollee

Prev Med Reports 11: 297–304. Objective To evaluate the validity of EHR data for monitoring longitudinal Medicaid coverage and assess variation by [CONTACT_85434], visit types, and clinic characteristics. Study Population Oregon Medicaid patients aged 18-64 years with a Medicaid ID or Medicaid insurance recorded in the OCHIN EHR ≥1 billed health care visit (excluding dental) from 184 Oregon CHCs in the OCHIN network linked to state Medicaid records during the study time period (1/1/2013–12/31/2014). N=135,514. Exclusion Criteria Patients with no Medicaid record on EHR who also did not have a Medicaid ID. Independent Variables Insurance cohort: (1) continuously Medicaid (Medicaid recorded at all visits); (2) continuously not Medicaid (Medicaid not recorded at any visit (patients could have Medicare, private, VA/Military, worker’s compensation, or no coverage); (3) Gained Medicaid: Medicaid not recorded for all visits in 2013 and Medicaid recorded at all visits in 2014; and (4) Discontinuously Medicaid: Any combination of visit coverage that did not follow the definitions above. Dependent Variables The primary outcome was agreement between EHR and Medicaid data in assigning patients to one of the four cohorts. Covariates Patient demographics (sex, age, race, ethnicity, language, household income represented as % FPL, urban/rural, number of common chronic conditions, and number of encounters),  visit and provider types, and clinic-specific (department type and customers of OCHIN's billing service) characteristics. We included the following common chronic conditions assessed 
 10 from diagnostic codes in the EHR: hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, lipid disorder, and asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Analysis Plan Visit-level: agreement, prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).

Guidelines for Study Conduct In conducting this study, you are required to follow the guidelines in the document entitled, "Roles and Responsibilities in the Conduct of Research and Administration of Sponsored Projects," as well as all other applicable OHSU IRB Policies and Procedures. Requirements under HIPAA If your study involves the collection, use, or disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI), you must comply with all applicable requirements under HIPAA. See the HIPAA and Research website and the Information Privacy and Security website for more information. IRB Compliance The OHSU IRB (FWA00000161; IRB00000471) complies with [ADDRESS_93139] (ACA) in a safety net population. We will assess the following in states that expanded Medicaid compared to those that did not or among states that expanded Medicaid:  • Pre-post rates of health insurance status and payer mix • Pre-post access to healthcare (i.e., visits, provider workforce, receipt of recommended healthcare services, receipt of chronic disease specific care and outcomes; receipt of preventive care, appropriate care for specialized populations such as cancer survivors and patients with multimorbidity/complex healthcare needs)  • Pre-post healthcare expenditures • Pre-post changes in health disparities (e.g., low-income, racial and ethnic minorities, rural versus urban)  We will look at differences in access to healthcare, expenditures, and disparities among those who gained coverage in the post-period, those who already had coverage, those with intermittent coverage, and those who remained uninsured. We will also try to understand how aggregated measures of social determinants of health constructed from community-level geocoded data (i.e., fast food availability, parks, income distribution, and racial/ethnic breakdown) from publicly available sources, such as the US Census Bureau, change the impact of disparities, access, and receipt of healthcare in relation to gaining or not gaining health insurance.  We propose to investigate how complex, and early-onset diseases affect the receipt of healthcare services later in life. Some of these analyses will focus on sub-group populations including patients with a history of cancer and those with multiple or complex chronic conditions. To accomplish these analyses, we will examine data from patients of all ages as many childhood cancers have a high likelihood of survival, and it is important to identify these patients as they are likely to have additional healthcare needs throughout their lifespan.   
 Background Health insurance facilitates access to care and reduces unmet healthcare needs,1-[ADDRESS_93140] healthcare-related legislation in the [LOCATION_002] (US) since Medicare’s establishment in 1966, was enacted with the goal of expanding coverage to all citizens and legal residents.6 The ACA increases opportunities to gain health insurance, including expansions in Medicaid coverage to individuals earning ≤ 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and the establishment of health insurance marketplaces. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states were not legally required to implement Medicaid 
 32 expansions, and those opting out could not be penalized.7 As of December 2014, 27 states (and D.C.) implemented the expansion;8 the number of states is increasing. Many persons directly affected by [CONTACT_85445] (CHCs), which comprise much of our nation’s healthcare ‘safety net’ and serve a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_85426];9 in 2012, 36% of CHC patients were uninsured.[ADDRESS_93141] (EHR) data from the Accelerating Data Value Across a National Community Health Center Network (ADVANCE) clinical data research network (CDRN) data warehouse and Oregon Medicaid administrative data.   The ADVANCE CDRN is a unique ‘community laboratory’ for research with underrepresented populations that includes patients receiving care in safety net clinics. The ADVANCE CDRN data warehouse includes integrated longitudinal outpatient EHR data from several organizations, including OCHIN, Health Choice Network, Fenway Health, and Legacy Health.   Oregon Medicaid administrative data will be linked to OCHIN Oregon clinics in the ADVANCE CDRN to assess the receipt of healthcare services outside the ADVANCE network clinics and all healthcare expenditures.  Additionally, we will partner with the state cancer registries of one or more states to complete probabilistic linkage between our patient population and reported cancer cases. It is currently unknown how well personal cancer history and related data are documented in the outpatient EHR (i.e., data contained in the ADVANCE CDRN), thus our ability to identify and characterize cancer survivors may be incomplete. A linkage with one or more state cancer registries will supplement the CDRN data by [CONTACT_85446]. This will allow us to test and validate our EHR-based algorithms, and to evaluate post-cancer care services provided by [CONTACT_85447].   
 Study Population a) Number of Subjects Approximately 2.3 million total possible subjects. All analyses will contain a subset of these subjects.  b) Vulnerable Populations Children ages 0-18 will be included for methods development and analyses related to childhood cancer and long-term care for cancer survivors. There is little literature about childhood cancers in vulnerable populations (e.g., economically marginalized, uninsured, or Medicaid insured) and associated disparities. Furthermore, adults with a history of childhood or adolescent cancer may require special follow-up care and screening 
 [ADDRESS_93142] access to their EHR records from earlier ages where available.  c) Setting This research will be conducted in collaboration with OCHIN. OCHIN requests the OHSU IRB serve as the IRB of record for this study.  d) Recruitment Methods and Consent Process All patients with data in the ADVANCE CDRN may be included in this study. Subsets may include only OCHIN EHR data, only Oregon OCHIN EHR data, only persons with certain diseases or conditions (e.g., cancer, diabetes, obesity), etc. For analysis of expenditures, Oregon OCHIN clinics from the ADVANCE CDRN will be linked to Oregon Medicaid administrative data using Medicaid identification number; subjects found in both datasets will be included. Similarly, for cancer registry linkage analyses only patients identified in both datasets will be included in analyses.  The ADVANCE data was collected under a waiver of authorization as the data warehouse poses very little risk to patients, and it was not practical to consent the number of patients included in the dataset.   
 Procedures Secondary data analysis will be conducted.  
 Data and Specimens a) Sharing of Results with Subjects Results will not be directly shared with subjects.  b) Data and Specimen Banking No specimens are being collected. Data is not being banked for future research.   
 Data Analysis We will summarize baseline measures using descriptive statistics and data visualization methods (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to characterize baseline data across clinic and state groups. We will estimate the differences in access and receipt of recommended health care. We will also assess health care expenditures. Our primary methodological approach will utilize difference-in-differences (DID) methodology. The DID approach has been frequently used by [CONTACT_85448]-expansion states over time, while adjusting for potential confounders.11-16  We will implement state random effects in clinic-level analyses and both clinic and state random effects in patient-level analyses to control for correlation of observations nested in clusters (e.g., individuals nested in clinics which are nested in states). We recognize that the assumption for random effects may not be met and we will also assess the robustness of our 
 [ADDRESS_93143],17 as well as assessing overall qualitative differences that may arise between the random and fixed effects models.  We will use GLMM models,18 which offer flexible regression modeling to accommodate different sources of correlations (serial, intra-clinic, and intra-state), categorical and continuous covariates, and fixed and time-dependent covariates. These methods offer a wide range of parametric distributions to model the dependent variables, including logistic regression (binary data), beta regression (percent data), Poisson regression (count data), and Gaussian regression (normally distributed data). The distribution of the outcomes of interest will be examined before selecting an analysis model; specific models will be refined through an iterative process.

For cancer registry linkage activities, we will access personal identifiers sufficient for completing probabilistic matching; direct identifiers will be stripped from all datasets and replaced with anonymized patient identifiers at the completion of linkage and for the duration of analyses.

Any data transferred from OCHIN to OHSU will fall under the same protocol as outline in the Data Use Agreement between these two institutions.   
 Risks and Benefits  a) Risks to Subjects There is a small risk of a loss of confidentiality.  b) Potential Benefits to Subjects There is no direct benefit to the subject for taking part in this study.

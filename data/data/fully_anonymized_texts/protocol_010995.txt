AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY 
 
Protocol Changes: 
The version date was updated throughout the protocol. 
 
Multicenter language added to the protocol, because sites other than UNCCH will be 
participating in the study. (sections 7.3, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6 and 9.8) 
 
C
larified that only patients who enroll at UNC will be asked to co-enroll into LCCC1108 
(sections 1.6, 2.2.7, 6.0 and 6.6) 
 
C
larified in exclusion criteria 3.2.2. that wash-out for prior radiation refers to definitive 
radiation therapy, not palliative radiation. 
Clarified that in  patients without diabetes, if glucose testing is not covered by [CONTACT_22241], glucose 
testing is not be mandated by [CONTACT_760] (sections 6.0-6.3).   
 
Added existing statement from footnote in table in section 4.4.1: Patients for whom cetuximab is 
discontinued due to grade 3-4 infusion reactions may complete the protocol therapy with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel alone, to sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
 
Clarified in footnote to 4.4.1 table that i f patient has a grade 1-2 infusion reaction during 
cetuximab, but is successfully rechallenged at a 50% lower infusion rate, it is acceptable to later 
re-increase back towards standard infusion rate

or
gan function and will be treated with six weekly cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel and 
cetuximab.  Following assessment of response, the treating physician at their discretion 
may continue to treat with weekly cetuximab as  maintenance until disease progression.  
The
 study is designed to evaluate whether this regimen improves median overall survival 
(O
S) as compared to an historical control population treated with a platinum plus 5-
fluor
ouracil (5-FU). There is currently no agreed upon first line therapy for recurrent or 
meta
static SCCHN; regimen options are highly toxic, inconvenient and resource intensive.  
Our study regimen has been used extensively for induction therapy and off-protocol in 
palliative care, but treatment outcomes have yet to be defin ed by a clinical trial.  
1.2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck 
The incidence of SCCHN in the [LOCATION_002] in 2013 was estimated at 43,640 cases[ 1].  
P
atients arrive at a designation of having “incurable” head and neck cancer somewhat 
differently from other cancers.  For example, while 75% of lung cancer patients present 
with metastatic disease, <10% of patients with SCCHN present with metastases.  Risk 
fa
ctors for distant metastases include primary site (as shown in Table 1 below), nodal 
status, t
umor size, age and race. [ 2]

2 1.3
 Chemotherapy for SCCHN 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], definitive (curative) approaches include surgery and radiotherapy and may 
include
 one or more anti-neoplastic drugs.  Induction or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is 
c
hemotherapy given prior to definitive therapy.  Unlike most cancers where studies are 
ini
tially performed in the metastatic setting and then extended to adjuvant use, much drug 
de
velopment in head/neck cancer has been studied in the induction setting, creating an 
opportunity for extension to the metastatic and recurrent setting.  
 
As a consequence of high rates of early presentation, curative therapy may have been 
attempted one or more times prior to a shift in goals of care to non-curative therapy.  When 
a cure is no longer possible, or when curative attempts have too low a probability of 
success relative to expected risks, functional deficits, or poor cosmetic results, the focus of 
care turns towards extension of duration of life and improvement in quality of life.  
 
Limited data make the exact portion of patients who could benefit from palliative therapy 
difficult to estimate. With more than 40,000 new cases per year (25% of which will 
ultim
ately be fatal), over 13,000 patients per year in the US alone will be eligible for 
pall
iative therapy (SEER, cancer.gov).  However, the rising incidence of human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV)-related oropharynx cancer and the continuing pandemic of smoking 
make these estimates, likely conservative. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_693930], palliative head and 
ne
ck regimens are under-studied.  In the history of palliative head and neck oncology, there 
ha
s been only 1 positive phase III study, the EXTREME trial.[ 3]   
 
In the EXTREME trial, [ADDRESS_941256]-line regimen of platinum (cisplatin [100 mg/m2 on day 1] or carboplatin [area under 
the c
oncentration x time curve [AUC] of 5mg/mL/min for 60 minutes on day 1]) plus 
fluor
ouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day for four days) every three weeks with or without 
c
etuximab (400 mg/m2 for the initial dose, followed by [CONTACT_693941] 250 
mg
/m2). Chemotherapy was given for a maximum of six cycles, although patients in the 
cetuximab arm who had at least stable disease received weekly cetuximab maintenance 
monotherapy until disease progression or toxicity. Chemotherapy plus cetuximab 
significantly prolonged OS compared with chemotherapy alone (median 10.[ADDRESS_941257] ratio for death 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99). Significant improvements were 
also seen in median progression free survival ( PFS): 5.6 versus 3.3 months and overall 
response ( OR rates; complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) of 36 versus 20 
pe
rcent, respectively. This regimen (EXTREME) is both toxic and insufficiently effective 
and thus, new effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_159358] a huge potential to alleviate suffering.  
 
No single regimen has been accepted as the standard first-line therapy in the management 
of locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Until the EXTREME regimen, no combination 
regimen demonstrated a survival advantage over any other regimen. However, most 
oncologists have not routinely accepted this three-medication regimen due to concerns 
about toxicity; 82% of the patients on the experimental arm experienced a grade 3 or 4 
e
vent. Others find the infusional 5-FU inconvenient for the typi[INVESTIGATOR_693931] a PORT and an infusion pack for four days during therapy. In 
addition, infusional 5-FU may cause substantial toxicity, including mucositis and diarrhea,

aclitaxel is as active as 5-FU in metastatic/recurrent SCCHN, but is less toxic and more 
convenient for the patient.  A phase III study, ECOG 1395, randomized patients with 
meta
static/recurrent SCCHN to cisplatin plus 5-FU or cisplatin plus paclitaxel.  Survival 
was comparable between the two arms, but toxicity favored paclitaxel:

4 A pha
se II study of combination paclitaxel and cetuximab demonstrated a median PFS of 
4.2 mont
hs and median OS  of 8.1 months. [ 5, 6]  While carboplatin and paclitaxel have 
been studied in 3-week treatment cycles in patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN, 
we
ekly administration of these agents along with cetuximab is often utilized in clinical 
pr
actice based on the favorable experience seen in the induction setting. [ 6, 7] [ 8]  [9]  
How
ever, this approach has never been prospectively validated in the metastatic/recurrent 
se
tting. 
 
Kies and associates treated 47 patients with locally advanced (N2b or greater) non-
meta
static disease with six weekly cycles of carboplatin AUC2, paclitaxel 135mg/m2 and 
c
etuximab 400mg/m2 loading followed by 250mg/m2 weekly.  Post induction therapy, 
pa
tients received radiation therapy alone (n=23), chemoradiation (n=23), or surgery alone 
(n=1) depending on their stage and quality of response to induction.  OR  at the end of 
ra
diation therapy was 96% with a CR of 70%.  Of note, the subset of patients positive for 
HPV-[ADDRESS_941260] common non-hematologic toxicity during induction therapy was 
ra
sh/folliculitis (grades 2 and 3 in 38% and 45% of patients, respectively), followed by 
[CONTACT_693942] (40% grade 2 and 2% grade 3), diarrhea (9% grade 2 and 9% grade 3) and sensory 
neur
opathy (15% grade 2 and 2% grade 3).  The most common grade 2 to 4 hematologic 
tox
icity was neutropenia (grades 2, 3, and 4 in 23%, 19%, and 2% of patients, 
respectively). There were no instances of febrile neutropenia. Dose reductions were needed 
in one patient for cetuximab and in four and two patients for paclitaxel and carboplatin, 
respectively. Treatment delays of ≥7 days occurred in 60% of patients. 
 
W
anebo et al, under the aegis of the ECOG, treated operable patients with stage III or IV 
disease with weekly carboplatin AUC2, paclitaxel 90mg/m2 and cetuximab 400mg/m2 
loading followed by [CONTACT_693943] 250mg/m2 weekly for six weeks.  During therapy, patients 
underwent tumor-staging biopsies at the primary site until biopsy negativity.  Forty of 67 
evaluable patients had a clinical response to induction chemotherapy and 26 (65%) had a 
biopsy-proven CR.  After 50 Gy chemoradiation (concurrent with carboplatin AUC1, 
paclitaxel 30mg/m2 and cetuximab 250mg/m2) all patients who had not yet had a negative 
biopsy were biopsied—all were negative.  Together, the Kies and Wanebo reports provide 
ve
ry strong support for induction regimens that include a taxane, carboplatin, and 
cetuximab.

observed high rates of response, leading to symptomatic benefit and low toxicity.  Further, 
the regimen de-medicalizes the patient’s life in several important ways.  First, unlike with 
the EXTREME regimen, no PORT or 4 day infusion is required.  Second, the regimen 
g
ives only six weeks of cytotoxic therapy.  Finally, in our experience there is a low rate of 
severe toxicity and this, coupled with the high rate of response, may improve quality of 
life
.  We are not aware of any presented or published results on the use of this combination 
in palliative therapy; with the adoption of this regimen in clinical practice, documentation 
of
 its benefit via conduct of a clinical trial is needed. 
LCCC 1330  CO NFIDENTIAL 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_693929]/Date 10/9/ [ADDRESS_941262] an improvement in median OS versus a historical 
control.  
The control arm from the EXTREME trial achieved a median OS of 7.4 months.  
We hypothesize that a less toxic and more effective 3-drug regimen will result in improved 
media
n OS compared with the control arm from EXTREME (median 7.4 months). The 
toxicity associated with EXTREME is primarily attributable to the cisplatin and 5FU 
cytotoxic backbone as its toxicity has been consistent in multiple studies of both palliative 
therapy and induction therapy. If a 4-month improvement in OS is achieved with 
a
cceptable toxicity, we will consider this regimen worth of further study. 
 
S
econdary objectives will include characterizing changes in quality of life (QoL), symptoms 
and toxicities. Patients at UNC only will be encouraged to co-enroll into the UNCseq protocol

 Paclitaxel 
Paclitaxel 135mg/m2 will be infused over 30 minutes.  Paclitaxel should be infused before 
c
arboplatin. Paclitaxel should be administered through an in-line filter with a microporous 
membr
ane not greater than 0.22 microns.  Actual body weight will be used for the 
c
alculation. On the day treatment with paclitaxel is due, if patient weight has changed by 
>
10%, recalculate the body surface area and dose of paclitaxel.   
4.2.3 Carboplatin 
Carboplatin will be infused at an AUC of 2, with the dose calculated using the Calvert 
e
quation (total dose (mg) = (target AUC) x (GFR +25).  The dose will be re-calculated 
prior
 to every cycle  in order to adjust for any potential change in renal function as assessed 
via se
rum creatinine (also checked each cycle). The patient’s glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) as creatinine clearance (CrCL) in mL/min will be calculated using the Cockcraft-
Gault formula, with weight defined as actual body weight: 
 
For males:  Creatinine clearance (GFR) (mL/min) = (140 –  age) x weight in kilograms 
                                                                                        72 x serum creatinine in mg/dl 
 
For females: use same formula but multiply by 0.85 for creatinine clearance 
 
A maximum GFR of 125 mL/min will be used.  Therefore, the maximum dose of 
carboplatin possible in this study will be 300 mg.  The carboplatin will be infused over 30 
minutes.  Carboplatin should be administered after paclitaxel. 
4.2.4 Premedications  
Cetuximab   
As discussed in the adverse events section (see section 5.1.4), the rate of infusion reaction 
to 
cetuximab is much higher in the Southeast than other areas of the country.  Therefore, at 
UNC the following procedures will be recommended during the administration of 
c
etuximab: 
 P remedicate all cetuximab infusions with diphenhydramine 50 mg PO or IV (may 
be
 reduced to 25mg at treating clinician discretion) and dexamethasone 8-20 mg PO 
or 
IV. 
 Admini ster an H2 blocker (e.g. cimetidine) PO or IV.   
 Patient to be observed one-on-one with first treatment.   Physician, physician’s 
a
ssistant (PA), or nurse practitioner (NP) must be present at initiation and through 
at least the first [ADDRESS_941270] infusion. 
 Disco ntinue cetuximab for bronchospasm and/or anaphylaxis. 
 Have available at bedside:  O2, epi[INVESTIGATOR_693932] 
(1:1000, 0.3mg) and methylprednisolone [ADDRESS_941271] sign of possible anaphylaxis as physician is being notified.

frequently helpful for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting include 
metoclopramide, lorazepam, diphenhydramine, steroids, and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
4.3.2 Growth factors 
Use of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA s) will not be permitted during 
c
hemotherapy.  The use of prophylactic filgrastim (G- CSF) during induction chemotherapy 
ma
y be considered (see table in section 4.4.2 ).  Peg- filg rastim (Neulasta®) is not permitted.  
The use of filgrastim will be permitted at the discretion of the treating physician in patients 
with l
ow blood counts that threaten treatment continuity.  Filgrastim administration is 
strongly advised in patients who have previous febrile neutropenia or who have treatment 
de
lays due to neutropenia.  When filgrastim is used, it should be administered per 
investi
gator/institution’s standard of care.  The number of days of filgrastim is up to the 
discretion of the treating MD; however, to protect patient safety, the patient must start at 
least [ADDRESS_941274] 48 hours prior to the next 
dose.  The dose of the filgrastim can be adjusted based on the investigator’s discretion.  
4.4
 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Any patient who receives any treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.  
Ea
ch patient will be assessed periodically for the development of any toxicity according to 
the Time and Events table.  Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should 
be
 made according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity.  Patients for 
whom cetuximab is discontinued due to grade 1-2 infusion reactions may complete the 
pr
otocol therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.

4.4.2 Suggested dose delays and dose modifications for paclitaxel and carboplatin 
For AEs that require dose reductions of paclitaxel or carboplatin, please refer to the dose 
levels in the following table:

Both carboplatin and paclitaxel are FDA approved chemotherapy agents that are routinely 
dose-adjusted by [CONTACT_693946].  Given the high level of clinical 
experience with these medications, clinicians can better individualize dose-reductions than 
rigid guidelines.  Therefore, when dose adjustment is required, the treating clinician shall 
decide whether to dose-reduce one or both agents; adjustments in the table above are 
sugg
ested. Suggested  dose delays and modifications for specific toxicities are made in the

 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy 
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_693935] 4.5 apply.  The reason for discontinuation of protocol therapy will be 
doc
umented on the eCRF.   
 
In case a patient decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses treatment”),

Excessive patient withdrawals from protocol therapy or from the study can render the study 
un-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided. 
4.8
 Study Withdrawal 
I
f a patient decides to withdraw from the study (and not just from protocol therapy) all

5.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
5.1 Cetuximab (Erbitux®)  
Please refer to cetuximab prescribing information revised in August, 2013 (see 
htt
p://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_erbitux.pdf ) for detailed information.    
5.1.1 Supplier/How Supplied 
Commercial supplies of cetuximab will be used for this study. It is available at a 
concentration of 2mg/mL as a 100mg/50mL single-use vial or as a 200 mg/100mL single 
use vial.  
5.1.2
 Dose and Schedule (see section 4.2) 
5.1.[ADDRESS_941282] common adverse reactions with cetuxumab (incidence ≥25%) are cutaneous 
adverse reactions (including rash, pruritus, and nail changes), headache, diarrhea, and 
infection.  The most serious adverse reactions with cetuximab are infusion reactions, 
cardiopulmonary arrest, dermatologic toxicity and radiation dermatitis, sepsis, renal failure, 
LCCC 1330  CO NFIDENTIAL 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_693929]/Date 10/9/ 2014    
 
15 int
erstitial lung disease, and pulmonary embolus.   Particular warnings and precautions 
(described in more detail in the prescribing information) associated with cetuximab include 
the following: 
 
  Infusion Reactions 
Serious infusion reactions, requiring medical intervention and immediate, permanent 
discontinuation of cetuximab, included rapid onset of airway obstruction (bronchospasm, 
stridor, hoarseness), hypotension, shock, loss of consciousness, myocardial infarction, 
a
nd/or cardiac arrest. Approximately 90% of severe infusion reactions occurred with the 
first infusion despi[INVESTIGATOR_236904], usually within minutes of starting 
the inf
usion. Infusion reactions have been reported to occur at a higher incidence in patients 
fr
om the Southeastern part of the [LOCATION_002], including at least North Carolina and 
Tennessee.  The overall rate of grade [ADDRESS_941283] dose 
in a dataset of 88 patients treated within clinical trials, and 55 treated outside of clinical 
trials wa
s 22% [ 10].   
 
Cardiopulmonary Arrest 
Cardiopulmonary arrest and/or sudden death occurred in 4 (2%) of 208 patients treated 
with ra
diation therapy and cetuximab as compared to none of 212 patients treated with 
ra
diation therapy alone in a randomized, controlled trial in patients with SCCHN.  
 
Pulmonary Toxicity 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including 1 fatality, occurred in 4 of 1570 (<0.5%) patients 
receiving cetuximab in clinical trials.  
 
Dermatologic Toxicity 
Dermatologic toxicities, including acneform rash, skin drying and fissuring, paronychial 
inflammation, infectious sequelae (for example S. aureus sepsis, abscess formation, 
cellulitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, cheilitis), and hypertrichosis occurred in 
patients receiving cetuximab therapy. Acneform rash occurred in 76–88% of 1373 patients 
re
ceiving cetuximab in clinical trials. Severe acneform rash occurred in 1–17% of patients. 
Ac
neform rash usually developed within the first two weeks of therapy and resolved in a 
major
ity of the patients after cessation of treatment, although in nearly half, the event 
continued beyond 28 days.  
 
Hypomagnesemia and Electrolyte Abnormalities 
In patients evaluated during clinical trials, hypomagnesemia occurred in 55% of patients 
(199/365) receiving cetuximab and was severe (NCI CTC Grades 3 and 4) in 6–17%. The 
onset of
 hypomagnesemia and accompanying electrolyte abnormalities occurred days to 
mont
hs after initiation of cetuximab.

Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose in Ringer’s Injection to a final concentration of 
0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL. The solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 27 hours at 
ambient temperature (approximately 25°C) and room lighting conditions. Parenteral drug 
products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration whenever solution and container permit. 
 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. 
To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear impervious gloves when handling 
vials containing paclitaxel. If paclitaxel solution contacts the skin, wash the skin 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topi[INVESTIGATOR_128547], events have 
included tingling, burning, and redness. If paclitaxel contacts mucous membranes, the 
membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water.

5.2.4 Adverse Events Associated With Paclitaxel 
S
ome of the adverse events expected with paclitaxel treatment are listed below. 
 
Hematologic : Hematologic side effects including bone marrow suppression have been the 
major dose-limiting toxicity. Neutropenia less than 2,000cells/mm3 (90%) is the most 
im
portant hematological toxicity. Neutropenia was both dose and schedule dependent, and 
was generally rapi[INVESTIGATOR_1920]. The onset of neutropenia generally occurs after 8 to 10 
da
ys and recovery generally occurs after 15 to 21 days.  Leukopenia less than 4,000 
cells/mm3 (90%) and less than 1,000 cells/mm3 (17%), thrombocytopenia less than 100,000 
cells/mm3 (20%) and less than 50,000 cells/mm3 (7%),  and anemia less than 11 g/dl (78%) 
and less than 8 g/dl (16%) have been reported. Infections (30%), bleeding (14%), red cell 
transfusions (25%) and platelet transfusions (2%) have been reported.  
 
Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity side effects were observed in 41% of all study patients; 
severe reactions (2%) have been reported. The most frequent symptoms observed during 
the severe reactions were dyspnea, flushing, chest pain and tachycardia. Minor 
hypersensitivity reactions consisted mostly of flushing (28%), rash (12%), hypotension 
(4%), dyspnea (2%), tachycardia (2%), and hypertension (1%). The se reactions can be 
succ
essfully managed with standard epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroid, and antihistamine therapy.

17  
Cardiovascular : Hypotension during infusion occurred in 12% of all patients and in 3% of 
all courses administered. Significant cardiovascular events possibly related to paclitaxel 
occurred in approximately 1% of all patients. Abnormal ECG readings have been reported 
in 23% of all patients receiving paclitaxel and in 14% of the patients with normal baseline 
ECGs. The most frequently reported ECG modifications were nonspecific repolarization 
abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia and premature beats. 
 
Neurologic : Nervous system side effects including neurotoxicity, primarily including 
peripheral neurosensory manifestations (60%), have generally been mild to moderate in 
severity. However, severe symptoms (3%) have also been reported. Other serious 
neurologic events (<1%) have been reported including grand mal seizures, syncope, ataxia, 
neuroencephalopathy and autonomic neuropathy resulting in paralytic ileus. 
 
The frequency and severity of neurologic manifestations have been dose dependent and 
cumulative. 
 
Gastrointestina l: Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting (52%), 
diarrhea (38%) and mucositis (31%) have been reported. Intestinal obstruction, intestinal 
perforation and ischemic colitis have been reported rarely. Three cases of pancreatitis have 
also been reported. Gastrointestinal effects can generally be treated with standard 
a
ntiemetic antidiarrheal therapy and dietary changes. 
 
Hepatic toxicity : Hepatic side effects including elevations in bilirubin (7%), alkaline 
phosphatase (22%) and AST (SGOT) (19%) have be en reported in patients with normal 
baseline levels. Hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death have been 
reported rarely.  
 
Other: Musculoskeletal side effects including myalgia and/or arthralgia (60%), including 
severe symptoms (8%) have been reported. Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis were 
reported by 52%, 38% and 31% of all patients, respectively.

Neurologic: Peripheral neuropathies have been observed in 4% of patients receiving 
carboplatin with mild paresthesia being the most common. 
 
Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting are the most common GI events; both usually 
resolve within 24 hours and respond to antiemetics. Other GI events include diarrhea (6%), 
constipation (6%), and gastrointestinal pain (17%). 
 
Hepatic toxicity: Elevated alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and AST have been 
observed. 
 
Other: Pain and asthenia are the most common miscellaneous adverse events. Alopecia has 
been reported in 3% of the patients taking carboplatin.

minimum size of: 
 > 10mm by [CONTACT_28842] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) 
 [ADDRESS_941296] x-ray. 
 Clinically palpable lesions will be considered measurable if they are both at 
least 1cm in maximal dimension and felt by [CONTACT_693948]. 
 C linically evident lesions on fiberoptic NPL will be considered measurable if 
they are both at least 1cm in maximal dimension and felt by [CONTACT_693949]. 
 
For malignant lymph nodes to be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
l
ymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_28842] (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed.   
 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions, 
will be considered non-measurable.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: 
leptomeningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial effusion; inflammatory breast disease; 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by [CONTACT_87415].

 All m
easurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The 
same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identifie
d and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Clinical lesions will only 
be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_693950] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended when 
contributory. 
6.8.2 B aseline Documentation of Target and Non-Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two 
lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longe r 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph 
node
s are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective 
tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent”, or in rare 
cases “unequivocal progression.”   
6.8.[ADDRESS_941297] 1.1 Criteria 
Complete response (CR)−Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
node (LN) target or no must have decreased in short axis to <10mm. 
 
Partial response (PR)−At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target lesions 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD. 
 
Progressive d isease (PD)−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the target 
lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started 
including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.  The 
appearance of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD. 
 
Stable disease (SD)−Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. 
LCCC 1330   CONFIDENTIAL 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_693929]/Date 10/9/ [ADDRESS_941298] 1.1 Criteria 
Complete response (CR) −Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker levels.  All LN must be non-pathological in size (<10mm short axis).   
 
Non-complete response (non-CR)/non-progression (non-PD) −Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 
Progressive disease (PD) −Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. 
6.8.[ADDRESS_941299] 1.1 Criteria 
The overall response is the response recorded from pretreatment to imaging conducted 
two weeks following completion of induction chemotherapy.  The clinical overall 
re
sponse will be defined according to the following table:

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1 De finitions 
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)     
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
LCCC 1330   CONFIDENTIAL 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_693929]/Date 10/9/ [ADDRESS_941300].   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414399] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not 
be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is 
attributable by [CONTACT_353202]. 
7.1.2 S uspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) 
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  
that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is evidence to suggest 
a
 causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies 
a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any 
adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration of the 
following
 factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known 
mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant 
drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other 
underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering 
drug as the cause of the AE: 
 S ingle occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with 
drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
 One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often 
more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed befor e 
the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug 
c
aused the event.   
 An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates 
the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent 
or
 historical control group 
7.1.[ADDRESS_941301] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for 
an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product 
characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are 
mentioned in the 
IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR 
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath; 
LCCC 1330   CONFIDENTIAL 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_693929]/Date 10/9/ 2014

  I s life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred); 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];* 
 Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 R esults in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions; 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also 
consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as 
an important medical event. 
 
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693937], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of 
primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events. 
 
Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE. 
7.[ADDRESS_941302] begin from day 1 of study treatment 
and continue through the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for that 
pa
tient.  Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and 
resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug.    Documentation

7.3 S AEs or Serious SARs  
7.3.1 T iming 
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by 
a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in).  
  
For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a serious 
S
AR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue 
throug
h the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.   
7.3.2 Doc umentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded in the SAE console within

7.3.3 Re porting  
IRB Reporting Requirements: 
UNC: 
 UN C will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually at the 
time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures. 
 The UNC-IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated 
Problem per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web-based reporting system 
(see section 9.5.3 within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
pr
oblem.   
 
 Affiliate sites:   
 F or affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse events per 
local IRB policy. 
 For affiliate sites relying on the UNC-IRB, an aggregated list of all SAEs will be 
submitted to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal according to the 
UNC IRB policies and procedures. In addition, any SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem will be entered into Oncore and reported to the UNC IRB 
by [CONTACT_693953] g the IRB’s web-based reporting system (see 
section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
 
Pregnancy 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of 
age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study, or within 
[ADDRESS_941304]’s la st dos e of study should be recorded as SAEs.  The patient is to 
be discontinued immediately from the study. The female subject should be referred to an 
obst
etrician-gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further 
evaluation and counseling. 
 
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome). If the 
outcome
 of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome 
meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.   
7.4 Dat a Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Princip al Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of patient safety in this 
trial with periodic reporting to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  
 
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, but at 
lea
st monthly,  which will include the investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical 
LCCC 1330   CONFIDENTIAL 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_693929]/Date 10/9/ 2014    
 
29 
 re
search associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other 
relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, 
the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, 
sa
fety, regulatory, and data collection. 
  
The
 team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be 
available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_693954], but not limited to, the 
oversight (Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncology 
Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and 
S
afety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
 
T
he UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the study 
on a
 regular (quarterly to annual) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and 
c
omplexity as determined by [CONTACT_87228].  The UNC PI [INVESTIGATOR_693938]: 1) safety and accrual 
data including the number of patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the 
literature that may affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) 
pr
eliminary response data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since 
the la
st report.  Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by [CONTACT_693955] 
P
I, PRC, and the UNC IRB and DSMB.   
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 S tudy Design/Endpoints 
This is a single-arm phase II trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN 
receiving carboplatin, paclitaxel and cetuximab.  The primary endpoint of this trial is OS 
and secondary objectives will include overall response rate, defined as CR+PR; PFS; 
c
haracterizing toxicities from the patient and physician perspective, and documenting 
quality of life measures.   
8.2 Sample Size and Accrual 
In the EXTREME study, a platinum plus 5-FU was compared to the same doublet with 
the addition of cetuximab; survival was improved from 7.4 to 10.1 months in the 
cetuximab arm.  We seek to improve survival from the control arm of EXTREME (7.4 
months) by [ADDRESS_941305] a one-sided alternative (assuming an exponential distribution).  With a one-
sided test, a
ccrual over 20 months, follow up of 18 months, and alpha of .05, 38 subjects 
will be required for a power of 80% (One Sample Survival; swogstat.org). 
 
W
e expect to accrue 2  patients per month, reaching 38  patients in approximately 20 
mont
hs.

 8.3 Dat a Analysis Plans 
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate OS and PFS, and median times will 
be reported with 95% confidence intervals.  OR (CR+PR) after six cycles of combined 
chemotherapy will  be reported with exact 95% confidence intervals.  Descriptive 
statis
tics will be used to characterize the safety profile of the combined chemotherapy 
re
gimen and report on quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_92349]- HN and patient-reported 
symptom scores as measured by [CONTACT_693956].   
 As sample size permits, exploratory subgroup analyses will be performed to compare key 
mea
sures of treatment efficacy (OR,  OS, PFS) between HPV+/- patients, and patients 
with di
fferent expression of genetic markers (as gathered in LCCC1108) using 
a
ppropriate non-parametric tests (Fisher’s Exact, Wilcoxon Rank Sum) and the Kaplan-
Meier method and Cox regression.   
 
9.[ADDRESS_941306] (IRB) Approval and Consent 
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and 
protocol. 
 
I
n obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
   
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_10000]. Once this essential information has been 
provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the 
implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001]-approved consent form. 
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be 
signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_80281].

 P
rotocol Deviations: UNC or Affiliate personnel will record the deviation in OnCore®, 
and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with 
their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of 
continuing review. 
 
Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by [CONTACT_65478] (1) 
week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online 
mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.   
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB: 
In addition to adhering to the policies regarding protocol compliance set forth by [CONTACT_106995]’s IRB, the following is also required: 
 
Protocol Deviations: In the event a deviation from protocol procedures is identified, 
record the deviation in OnCore®. 
 
Protocol Violations: Any protocol violation that occurs must be reported to your IRB 
per institutional policies and reported to the U NCC N Project Manager within 5 days. 
UNC -
CH will determine if the violation affects the safety of the patient and integrity of 
the da
ta.  Once your institution’s IRB response is received, please forward to the UNCCN 
R
egulatory Associate. 
 
Unanticipated Problems:  
UNC  
An
y events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB 
must be reported by [CONTACT_65479]’s web-based reporting system.  
 
Affiliate Sites: 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB 
must also be reported to the UNCCN Project Manager.   The UNCCN Project Manager 
will report the event to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web-based reporting system.  
Examples of such UPs include a lost or stolen laptop computer that contains sensitive 
study information. 
9.6 A mendments to the Protocol 
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and 
documented by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_353190].  It should also be noted that when an 
amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risk to the 
patient, a revised consent form might be required.   
 
For Institutions Relying on UNC’s IRB: 
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent to 
UNC’s IRB for approval prior to implementation.  
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB: 
Investigators must submit the UNC IRB approved amendment to their institution’s IRB 
for approval.  For multi-center studies, any affiliate site must submit their informed 
consent revisions to the UNCCN Regulatory Associate prior to submission to their IRB.

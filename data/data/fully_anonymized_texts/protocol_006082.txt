CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma  1. Background and Rati onale  
The American Cancer Society estimated an incidence of ~54,000 cases of renal cancer in 2009, 
with ~13,000 dying of their disease 1. Seventy -five percent of renal tumors are of the clear -cell renal cell 
carcinomas (ccRCC). Angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ccRCC with production 
of VEGF 2. The recent FDA approval of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Sunitinib, Sorafenib, 
Everolimus, and Temsirolimus has dramatically changed the therapeutic paradigm of ccRCC, and has 
resulted in increased respon se rates in patients with metastatic ccRCC 3-6.  
Axitinib, a novel oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR -1, VEGFR -2, and VEGFR -3 has been 
recently investigated in 52 patients with metastatic ccRCC who failed prior  systemic therapy with 
Interferon - or Interleukin -2 7. Responses were seen in 23 patients (44.2%), with two patients achieving 
complete response and one patient without prior nephrectomy having partial shrinkage of  the primary 
renal tumor. Axitinib has also been investigated in 62 patients with metastati c ccRCC refractory to 
sorafenib  8, and partial response was observed in 22.6% of patients, with 80% experiencing some degree  
of tumor shrinkage. As such, axitinib appears to be a promising agent in the treatment of metastatic 
ccRCC.  
We will be using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib up to [ADDRESS_404104] not received any preoperative therapy.  
Neoadjuvant therapy in the non -metastatic setting has the potential of improving overall 
survival, as seen from trials in non -metastatic bladder cancer 11. To date, there are no published 
prospective trials of neoadjuvant targeted therapy prior to radical nephrectomy in patients without 
metastases. The use of axitinib in patients with ccRCC prior to radical nephrectomy has the potential of 
decreasing tumor size (which might allow us to perform a partial nephrectomy rather than a radical 
nephrectomy -thereby [CONTACT_327593]), regression of invasi on into adjacent organs, regression 
of tumor venous thrombi, therefore improving surgical margins and treatment outcomes. In addition, 
collection of blood and tissue for molecular and genetic analysis is possible using this neoadjuvant 
approach, which will  provide valuable information about molecular correlates of tumor response to 
[ADDRESS_404105] the appropriate patients to receive neoadjuvant ther apy.   
 
2. Protocol Drug  
2.1. Axitinib  
2.1.1.  Dosage  
Axitinib is given orally at a starting dose of 5mg twice daily (BID) with food. Dosage 
modifications will be discussed below.  
2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
Axitinib administered in the fed state is absorbed rapi [INVESTIGATOR_375], with peak plasma 
concentrations occurring within 2 to 6 hours. Plasma concentrations declined with a 
terminal plasma half -life between 2 and 5 hours. Axitinib plasma PK reached steady 
state within 15 days. At the phase II dose of 5 mg BID given in the  fasted state, the 
between -patient coefficient of variation for AUC 0-24 on cycle 1, day 15 was 90%; the 
corresponding coefficient of variation for Cmax was 63%. Both the rate and extent of 
absorption were higher in the fasted state. Peak concentrations occ urred 1 to 2 hours 
after dosing in the fasted state, and there was a median 49% increase in plasma 
exposures compared with the fed state. Plasma half -life was not changed appreciably in 
fed and fasted states.  
In the presence of the potent proton -pump inhi bitor rabeprazole, the rate of 
absorption of axitinib was decreased, but the extent of absorption was unaffected. 
Because of the minimal change in plasma exposure in the presence of rabeprazole, the 
effect of antacids on axitinib absorption was not conside red to be clinically significant.  
Twelve -hour urinary collections obtained on days 1 and 29 (cycle 2, day 1) 
demonstrated that < 1% of the administered dose appeared as unchanged drug in the 
urine regardless of dose, which indicates that the majority of d rug elimination was 
through systemic metabolism.  
Soluble plasma proteins (VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor -
alpha, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9) evaluated as exploratory markers related 
to VEGFR signal transduction pathways di d not show any variation with treatment.  
2.1.3.  Side Effects Profile  
[ADDRESS_404106] common side effects (all grades) are hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, 
nausea, hoarseness, anorexia, dry skin, and weight loss.  
  
3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

5. Assessment of Response  
CT scans of the chest and abdomen will be evaluated by a urologist and an expert genitourinary 
radiologist. The ur ologist (investigator assessment) and the radiologist (independent assessment) 
will perform the tumor measurements.  Response will be determined by [CONTACT_327596]. 
Tumor measurements will be documented in the tumor measurement form (one of the CRFs) and 
medical record.  GURU will be used as electronic case report forms (CRF).  RECIST  version 1.0  criteria 
will be used as follows to quantify response to therapy:  
 Complete Response (CR):  Complete disappearance of renal mass.  
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the largest diameter (LD) of the renal mass 
taking as reference the baseline largest diameter.  
 Progressive disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the LD of the renal mass taking as 
reference the LD of the renal mass recorded since  the treatment started. PD will also include 
development of any biopsy -proven metastatic disease.  
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as reference the LD since the treatment s tarted.  
 Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as CR+PR.  
 ORR will be evaluated when CT abdomen is done after 12 weeks of treatment (see Table 4). 
 PD will be evaluated when CT abdomen is done after 7 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment 
(see Table 4). 
 
6. Statis tical Considerations  
6.1. Statistical Considerations for Primary Objective  
2010 -0072  
November  23, 201 6 
Page 10  
CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma   The primary objective of this study is to assess objective response rate (ORR) following 
the administration of axitinib for [ADDRESS_404116] reason to believe that axitinib does not provide minimal efficacy, defined as Pr[ORR ≥ 
20% | data] < 5%. We also plan to stop recruitment should we have reason to believe that it 
may be harmful, defined as Pr[PD > 20% | data] > 80%, where PD is progressive disease. We will 
monitor study patients using the Bayesian approach of Thall  12. ORR will be evaluated at week 12 
following initiation of treatment and PD will be evaluated at week 7  and week 12  following 
initiation of treatment.  
 For calculating our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_327576] , we assume that ORR ~ Beta(0.4, 1.6) and PD ~ Beta(0.4, 1.6).  The prior for both 
ORR and PD has a mean of 20% and a standard deviation of 23%.  
 We will continually evaluate patients for excessive PD as they  are being enrolled . We 
will begin evaluating for minimal ORR after the first [ADDRESS_404117] a nephrectomy, w e do not feel that delaying evaluation for 
futility until 18 patients are treated  will jeopardize patient wellbeing.  Once the minimum 
number of patients has been treated  and assessed for  ORR and PD, we will continue to assess 
both outcomes after each addi tional patient has been evaluated.  
The trial will be stopped for futility (low ORR) if  
 [# of patients with ORR / # of patients evaluated at Week 12] ≤ 1/18.  
Likewise, the trial will be stopped for excessive PD if  
 [# of patients with PD / # of patients evaluated at Week 7 and 12 ] ≥ 3/6, 4/9, 5/13, 6/17, 7/21.  
 To illustrate the use of these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], suppose [ADDRESS_404118] 18 respond, then an additional 6 patients will be treated  for 
a total of 24 patients. Likewise, if 6 out of 17 patients had PD, we would close the study for 
excessive PD.  
 The operating characteristics for the futility monitoring rule are shown in Table 1 and for 
the PD monitoring rule are shown in Table 2.  The operating characteristics in Table 1 do not 
2010 -0072

Page 11  
CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma  account for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_327577]; likewise, the operating characteristics in Table 2 
do not account for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_327578].   
 We plan to stop  recruitment if we obs erve 2 treatment -related deaths . Treatment -
related deaths are defined as deaths directly caused by [CONTACT_327597], or intraoperatively, or within 30 days after  nephrectomy, and the decision to 
classify the deaths as directly caused by [CONTACT_327598]. Perioperative  mortality for patients undergoing radical nephrectomy  is estimated 
to be between 1% and 4%  13-15.  The operating characteristics associated with this decision 
criterion  are shown in Table 3.  These  probabilities were derived by [CONTACT_56047] 1,000 simulations.  
 We also plan to stop recruitment if two or more patients a) cann ot undergo radical 
nephrectomy as a result of participating in the study, or b) experience a delay in time to radical 
nephrectomy of more than [ADDRESS_404119] axitinib dose, or c) experience inadequate healing 
post -operatively defined as fascial dehiscen ce requiring reoperation, or d) experience severe 
bleeding post -operatively defined as bleeding requiring reoperation.

 Based on operating characteristics of the ORR futility monitoring rule (Table 1), we ha ve 
a 10.6% chance of closing the study early if the ORR truly is only 20%.     
 Once we have completed the study we will estimate the objective response rate for 
axitinib with a 90% credible interval. We will also report the posterior probability that the 
objective response rate is more than 20%. If this posterior probability is greater than 80%, we 
will conclude that axitinib was successful and therefore merits further study as a neoadjuvant 
therapy in this patient population.  This would mean that axitini b would be considered 
successful if 7 or more patients had ORR.  
 
6.2. Statistical Considerations for Secondary Objectives  
6.2.1.  To examine the safety of axitinib, we will tabulate reported adverse events (adverse 
events will be recorded per CTCAE v4.0).   
6.2.2.  To examine the tolerability of axitinib, we will use the FKSI -15 (Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy -Kidney Specific Index -15, Appendix E ) questionnaire and compare changes 
in response between different time points.  
6.2.3.  We will evaluate disease -free survival by [CONTACT_327599] -Meier curves and estimating 
median recurrence -free survival.  Time to death or recurrence will be defined as the time 
from treatment start until death, recurrence or progressive disease, whichever comes first.  
Patients who did not die, recur o r have progressive disease will be censored at date of last 
follow -up.  These will be compared to contemporary, matched (2:1 matching, for age 
group, stage and grade), historical controls. Although small differences in recurrence -free 
and overall survival might not be detected in this current trial, this information will help us 
when designing future large trials with this particular agent.

CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma  7. Treatment Plan (Table 4) 
7.1. Pre-treatment  screening  
7.1.1.  Patients will undergo routine staging evaluatio n to include CT ches t and abdomen with 
renal protocol, to evaluate extent of local disease and rule out the presence of metastatic 
disease.  If the patient had these CT scans done at an outside facility within [ADDRESS_404121] scans may  not need to be repeated at MD Anderson, 
as long as the actual CD or DVD of the films are available (and not just the report) and as 
long as the protocols used for the CT scans were similar to those at MD Anderson (i.e. 
renal protocol with intravenous contrast ne eds to be used). If the CD or DVD is from an 
outside facility, it has to be reviewed by [CONTACT_327600]/or radiologist here to check the 
quality of the images (for example, if the CT scan was done within [ADDRESS_404122] scan prior to starting study treatment ). If only a report is available, the CT scans will 
need to be repeated at MD Anderson to be eligible for the study. Bone scan and CNS 
imaging will be done  at the discretion of the attending physician for patients with 
indications to do so (elevated alkaline phosphatase, bone pain for bone scan, and CNS 
symptoms for CNS imaging). An EKG will be done.  
7.1.2.  CBC, CMP ( sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, ca lcium, glucose, BUN, 
creatinine, magnesium,  phosphorus , lactate dehydrogenase, AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, albumin, total protein) , PT, PTT, TSH, free T3, free 
T4, and urinalysis will be obtained within [ADDRESS_404123]  (Appendix J), ECOG Performance Sta tus, 
Adverse Events, and EKG will be performed and recorded in the medical record within 4 
weeks of study enrollment as noted in Table 4.   
7.1.4.  Patients that meet eligibility criteria will undergo image -guided biopsy (18G core needle 
biopsy x 4 cores and touch  prep -1 core for pathologic diagnosis, 3 optional cores for tissue 
banking) of their primary tumor to establish the presence of clear cell histology.   
7.1.5.  If a prospective patient has untreated hypertension at presentation, the patient will be 
placed on a medi cal regimen to control the hypertension, prior to enrollment  (Enrollment

in CORe step 2).  
 
7.2. Treatment Phase

given/specify, permanently discontinued agent, non -drug treatment 
given/specify, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
-Date of AE stop  
-Outcome (recovered without sequelae, recovered with sequelae, 
ongoing, worsened, death)  
-Serious AE (yes, no ) 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse events (SAE):  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  SAE reporting -SAEs will be recorded on a SAE form  (Appendices G and H) , in addition to the 
CRF AE documents. SAEs will be reported within 24 hours to [COMPANY_007] (Please see [COMPANY_007] SAE 
reporting guidelines in the appendix sectio n)  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING – M. D. Anderson Cancer Center : 
The following SAE Reporting Requirements, since this is an MDACC sponsored IND 
study, and all SAEs must be reported to IND Sponsor repres entative  – the IND Office - 
accord ing to t he follow ing: 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.1.  A serious adverse event is – any adverse  drug experience occurring at 
any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
- Death  
- A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse 
experience that places the patient, in the vi ew of the initial  
reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse 
[ADDRESS_404125] caused death  
- Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_327580]  
- A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions  
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.2.  In this protocol, we will not report those  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s resulting from 
routine  treatment not associated with any deterioration in condition , 
treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to axitinib and has 
not worsened since the start of axitinib; or for treatment on an 
emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfill ing any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.3.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based  upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requirin g intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
(21 CFR 312.32):  
- Important medical events as defined above, may also  be 
considered serious adverse events. Any important medical 
event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_327581]  . 
- All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and 
meeting the definit ion of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in 
2010 -0072

Review Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse Events”.  
Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or 
unexpected, must be reported to the IND office , regardless of 
attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
- All life -threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and 
regardless of attribution  to the study drug, must have a written 
report submitted within 24 hours  (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to the IND office  
- The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” 
will be used for reporting to the IND office . 
- Serious adverse eve nts will be captured from the time the 
patient signs consent until [ADDRESS_404126] be 
reported to  the IND office . This may include the development  of 
a secondary malignancy.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.4.  Reporting to FDA:  
- Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_327601],  according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.5.  It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_327582], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
7.2.5.  Axitinib Starting Dose: Patients will receive up to 12 weeks of axitinib orally. Axitinib is 
started at a dose of 5mg BID (twice each day) taken orally with food. Dose adjustments, 
including dose increase or dose reduction should be based on adverse events experienced 
[ADDRESS_404127] not “make it up” with an ex tra dose, but 
instead resume subsequent doses as prescribed. Any missed dose may be taken late up to 
[ADDRESS_404128] be indicated in the source documents and  CRFs.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642]  
(Appendix J) will be provided where the patient will record the date, time (AM or PM), and 
dose of axitinib taken, as well as the blood pressure measurement prior to axitinib intake  
(Appendix  J). Available a xitinib dose levels are list ed below.

7.2.6.  Axitinib  dose modifications during trial: Patients will receive axitinib at a starting dose of 
5 mg orally twice daily until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent occurs , or until 1.5 days prior to surgery .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Axitinib dose increase: Beca use previous studies indicated variable drug levels in 
patients, the axitinib dose will be increased in a step -wise fashion from 5 mg twice 
daily to 7 mg twice daily, then to 10 mg twice daily, in the absence of axitinib -related 
toxicity greater than or eq ual to grade 2 for a continuous 2-week period and in the 
absence of hypertension (defined as two blood pressure [BP] measurements of > 
150/90 mmHg taken in the clinic > 1 hour apart) at any point during study. The 
clinical judgment of the treating physicia n should be exercised in up -titrating the 
axitinib dose.

[IP_ADDRESS].4.  If patients need to have their axitinib treatment interrupted for [ADDRESS_404132] their kidney tumors removed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5.  Patients removed from treatment for intolerable toxicity should still be followed with 
regular tumor assessments  (every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the next 2 years and 
every  12 months for one more year)  until disease progression or start of new treatment, and 
for survival thereafter  until study completion . 
[IP_ADDRESS].6.  The criteria for dose modification for study -drug -related adverse events  are summarized in 
the table below:  
CRITERIA FOR  DOSE MODIFICATION  FOR AXITINIB -RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS OTHER THAN 
HYPERTENSION OR PROTEINURIA  
Related Adverse Events  INTERVENTION  
Grade 1  Increase to next dose level , or maintain if already at 
the maximum dose  
Grade 2  Continue at same dose level  
Grade 3 nonhematologic treatment -related 
toxicity*  or Grade 3 hematologic toxicity  Decrease dose to one lower dose level  
Grade 4 hematologic treatment -related 
toxicity**  Interrupt dosing; re -start at one lower dose level as 
soon as improvement to CTCAE Grade ≤2 occurs 
within 2 weeks . If a patient requires dose reduction 
below 2 mg BID when above fails, consideration 
should be given to stop axitinib if this recurs.  
Grade 4 nonhematologic treatment -related 
toxicity  Stop Axitinib  
* Patients who develop Grade 3 no nhematologic toxicities that are controlled with symptomatic 
medications or Grade 3 asymptomatic biochemistry laboratory abnormalities may be continued at the 
same dose level at the discretion of the investigator.  
** Patients who develop Grade 4 lymphopeni a or Grade 4 asymptomatic biochemistry laboratory 
abnormality may continue study treatment without interruption.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Axitinib dose -reduction for hypertension:  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Electronic BP monitors will be provided to each patient for home use. Instructions to use 
them will b e provided (Appendix F) and demonstration of their use will be done in the visit 
2010 -0072  
November  23, 201 6 
Page 20  
CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma  prior to starting axitinib intake. Patients will self -monitor BP at home twice daily (before each 
axitinib dose). All BP measurements will be recorded in a diary (Appendix J) and brought to the 
clinic at each clinic visit. Patients will be instructed to inform their physicians in the event of 
systolic BP greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic BP greater than 100 mmHg, or if they develop 
symptoms related to elevated BP (e.g. headach e or visual disturbance).  During normal business 
hours the patient will call the urology research nurse for instructions. Outside of normal 
business hours, the patient will call the urologist on call through the page operator, and inform 
the urologist that  they are enrolled in the axitinib trial. The urologist on call will then contact 
[CONTACT_327602] ([CONTACT_192279], [CONTACT_327608], [CONTACT_327609] or [CONTACT_327610]) for further 
instructions.  Written contact [CONTACT_327603] (Appendix I)  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  New or additional antihypertensive therapy should be started if [ADDRESS_404133] 1 hour, show the following: 2 systolic BP readings 
greater than 150 or 2 diasto lic BP readings greater than 100 mm Hg. Alternately, the dose of 
existing antihypertensive medication(s) may be increased. If the patient is already on maximal 
antihypertensive treatment, the axitinib dose should be reduced by 1 dose level.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Patients who ha ve [ADDRESS_404134] treatment with axitinib held. (Note: if axitinib is held, patients receiving antihypertensive 
medications should monitor closely for hypotension and restart axitinib  at one lower dose level 
as soon as BP is <150/100 mm Hg. Plasma half -life of axitinib is 2 – 6 hours and BP usually 
decreases within 1 -2 days following dose interruption.)  Treatment with axitinib  should be 
restarted at 1 lower dose level as soon as the systolic blood pressure reduces to less than 150 
mm Hg and the diastolic BP reduces to less than 100 mm Hg.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Patients who develop recurrent systolic hypertension ([ADDRESS_404135] 1 
hour show systolic pressure >150 mm Hg) or recurrent diastolic BP >100 mm Hg following 
previous axitinib dose reduction should undergo another dose reduction by [CONTACT_30560].  
[IP_ADDRESS].5.  Patients removed from treatment for intolerable toxic ity should still be followed with 
regular tumor assessments  (every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the next 2 years and 
every 12 months for one more year)  until disease progression or start of new treatment, and 
for survival thereafter  until study completion .  Guidance on dose interruption and reduction for 
hypertension is summarized in the table below.

CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma  [IP_ADDRESS].6.  The antihypertensive medications (if the patient is taking any) will be tapered after axitinib 
is stopped, in order to maintain a blood pressure lev el that is less or equal to 140/90. Once the 
patient is at this blood pressure level, his blood pressure/blood pressure medications will be 
managed by [CONTACT_327604] .

perform [ADDRESS_404143] results. 
[Equivalence of protein qualitative levels on urine dipstick and urinalys is are as follows: 1+ on 
dipstick is equivalent to 30 on urinalysis, 2+ on dipstick is equivalent to 100 on urinalysis, 3+ on 
dipstick is equivalent to 300 on urinalysis, and 4+ on dipstick is equivalent to >2000 on

regular tumor assessments  (every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the next 2 years and 
every 12 months for one more y ear) until disease progression or start of new treatment, and for 
survival thereafter  until study completion .   
7.2.7.  Concomitant therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS].  The patient will provide a list of medications taken within [ADDRESS_404144] during each clinic visit while being treated 
with axitinib. The name, dose, date of start, date of stop (if use for short term), 
indication of the m edication will be listed. (Appendix J)

CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma  7.2.11.  Laboratory studies that include CBC, CMP, PT, PTT, UA will be obtained prior to starting 
axitinib, then at week 3, week 7, and week 12 after starting  axitinib. In addition, blood 
studies for TSH, free T3, and free T4 will be performed prior to starting axitinib, and then 
blood studies for TSH will be performed at week 3, week 7, and week 12 after starting 
axitinib. With each blood draw, 4 tubes of rese arch blood will be drawn and processed for 
DNA, serum, plasma, and PBMC isolation for correlative studies, after the patient has 
provided informed consent.  
7.2.12.  Imaging: CT scans of the chest and abdomen (renal protocol) will be obtained on week [ADDRESS_404146] version 
1.0 at week 7 (primary or metastatic) will be considered treatment failures  and their 
axitinib treatment will be permanently discontinued. Subsequently, their surgery will be 
performed earlier than initially planned . The urologist (investigator assessment) and the 
radiologist (independent assessment) will perform the tumor measurements. Response 
will be determined by [CONTACT_327596]. Tumor measurements will be 
documented  in the tumor measurement form (one of the CRFs) and medical record.  
7.2.13.  Surgery: Following successful completion of presurgical therapy, patients will undergo 
radical nephrectomy (open or laparoscopic at the surgeon’s discretion), with 
retroperitoneal lymph n ode dissection.  Extent of lymph node dissection will be recorded 
in the operative record and should include the ipsilateral nodes from renal hilum to aortic 
bifurcation, as well as the interaortocaval nodes from renal hilum to aortic bifurcation.  
Primary  tumor specimens will be immediately sent to pathology on ice for further 
processing and correlative study specimen harvest.  Routine perioperative parameters will 
be recorded and will include operative approach, operative time, estimated blood loss, 
ease of surgical dissection, comment on tissue planes, intraoperative complications (with 
grade), post -operative complications (with grade), blood transfusions, length of ICU stay (if 
applicable), length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], perioperative mortality (within 30 days  of surgery).  The 
operating urologist will make a decision based on their extensive surgical expertise if these 
adverse events are attributable to axitinib or not. These events will certainly be monitored 
and recorded by [CONTACT_327606], and discus sed with the IND if they arise.

CG Wood et al. Phase II Trial Of Neoadjuvant Axitinib In Locally Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma  7.3.1.  Patients will be seen at week 19 ( +/- 1 week ) and evaluated with CT chest and abdomen 
(renal protocol), full laboratory analysis (CBC, CMP), collection of blood and urine for 
research, and full hist ory and physical examination.  Evidence of disease recurrence  [If a 
patient develops any evidence of biopsy -proven RCC after axitinib/surgery (in the form of 
local disease or distant disease), the patient will be labeled as having disease recurrence ] 
or tr eatment related morbidity will be recorded.  Pathology will be reviewed and will be 
assessed for histology, Fuhrman grade, percentage tumor viability, pathologic tumor size, 
presence of venous, extracapsular, sinus, or nodal involvement.  
7.3.2.  A history, physica l examination, medication list  (Appendix J), ECOG Performance Status, 
Adverse Events, FKSI -15 questionnaire  (Appendix E)  will be performed and recorded in the 
medical record and appropriate CRFs on week 19.  
7.3.3.  Patients will be followed with similar evaluation s every 4 months  (+/- 2 weeks)  for the 
first year, then every 6 months (+/- 2 weeks)  for the next 2 years , , then yearly (+/- 1 
month) until year [ADDRESS_404147] to ensure biopsy quality (ie, maligna nt cell 
present with minimal necrosis/hemorrhage). More cores will be obtained if touch prep 
shows inadequate diagnosis (to obtain a total of 4 adequate cores).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  One core will be fixed for pathologic evaluation and sent for pathology department 
for review p rior to starting treatment . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Three cores will be immediately placed in 3 separate cryotubes, labeled 
appropriately, and stored at -70° to -80°C for future use.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  All 4 touch prep slides will be labeled appropriately, and stored at room 
temperature for future use. 
8.1.2.  Kidney surgical specimen:  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tissues from final kidney surgical specimen (4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_327588], 5 -10mm diameter 
each; and 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_327589], 5 -10mm diameter each) will 
[ADDRESS_404148] aced in a separate 
cryotube, labeled appropriately, and stored at -70° to -80°C for future use.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  In accordance with pathology standards, several blocks of tissue will be fixed in 
formalin and embedded in paraffin, and stored at room temperature for future u se. 
8.2. Blood  
8.2.1.  Four different tubes will be collected at specified visits (Table 4), processed, labeled 
appropriately, and stored in aliquots at -70° to -80°C for future use.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tube 1 (8cc): PAXgene Blood DNA tube to collect DNA  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tube 2 (8cc): BD Vacutainer CPT tu be to collect plasma (Sodium Citrate) and PBMC  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tube 3 (10cc): BD Vacutainer EDTA tube to collect plasma (K2 EDTA) and PBMC  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tube 4 (10cc): BD Vacutainer Serum tube to collect serum  
8.3. Urine  
8.3.1.  30-50cc fresh voided urine obtained will be collected at specified vis its (Table 4), 
processed, labeled appropriately, and stored in aliquots at -70° to -80°C for future use.  
8.4. Blood and urine collection for research are optional but extremely valuable for the study. These 
samples will be used in the future to study predictors  of response to therapy with axitinib.  
 
9.  Good Clinical Practice  
9.1. Informed Consent:  
The investigator/team will explain to the patient the nature of the clinical trial, its goal, potential 
benefits and risks. The patient will be informed that participation in  the trial is voluntary, and 
that withdrawal is allowed at any time of the study, and that withdrawal will not affect 
subsequent medical treatment or relation with treating investigator/team. The informed 
consent is a document written in non -technical lang uage. The patient will need to read the 
consent, ask pertinent questions, sign and date prior to starting study treatment . Separate 
consents will be obtained for required preoperative biopsy.  
9.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB):  
Prior to enrolling the first p atient in this study, the protocol, related documents, and the 
informed consent forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_327607], the Clinical 
Research Committee, and the IRB. Pertinent amendments to the protocol will need to be 
approved by [CONTACT_3433] e IRB  and the IND Sponsor – IND Office.

1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Software Treatment for Actively Reducing the 
Severity of ADHD as Adjunct ive Treatment to 
Stimulant  
Phase:  Post Registration Follow Up Trial 
  
Description of Study Intervention  & 
Symptom Tracking : Intervention:  AKL -T01 is digital therapeutic 
software for the neuromodulatory treatment of 
attention and inhibitory control deficits in pediatric patients with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder.  AKL-T01 is an 
investigational medical device  known as Software 
as a Medical Device (SaMD) . 
Symptom Tracking:  AKL-X01 (Fengo)  is a mobile 
application (app) that provides a convenience 
service to caretakers  to capture their routine 
observations of their child’s ADHD symptoms and 
beha viors in a structure d format .  AKL -X01 
(Fengo) captures symptoms data and provides 
simple graphical displays; it is not an investigational medical device. 
Study Des cription : The study aims to enroll (203)  participants , with a 
confirmed diagnos is of AD HD, at approximately  
15 sites and will be divided between 2 cohorts ; 
(130) participants will be enrolled in Cohort 1, 
and (73) participants will be enrolled in Cohort 2.  
Cohort [ADDRESS_778230] been 
stable  (adherence to a prescribed medication 
schedule)  on a stimulant medication , but are 
inadequately managed by [CONTACT_590506]  (in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]) . The stimulant is  
managed by [CONTACT_590507] 30 
days before baseline .  This is t he “stimulant 
cohort .”  
Cohort 2,  the secondary cohort will have been 
stable without any stimulant medication  for at 
least 30 days before the baseline .  This is the “ no 
stimulant ” cohort . 
For both cohorts, at least 7 and up to 30 day s 
before b aseline, participants’ caretakers will 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  8 begin using AKL -X01 (Fengo)  to track  their 
participant s’ symptoms and behaviors.  
During Treatment Phase 1  (Days  1 through 28 ) 
participants in Cohort 1 (stimulant) will continue 
to receive their current stimulant plus the 
addition of  AKL-T01. Participants in Cohort 2  (no 
stimulant)  will only receive AKL-T01.  For both 
cohorts, during this time the caretakers will 
monitor their child’s symptoms daily  with AKL -
X01. 
During the 1 -Month Break  (Days 29 through 56) 
between AKL-T01 treatment phases , participants 
in Cohort 1 (stimulant) will continue to receive 
their current stimulant .  In both cohorts, AKL -T01 
will be suspended during this time.  For both cohorts, during this time caretakers  will continue 
to monitor their child’s symptoms daily with AKL-
X01.  
During Treatment Phase 2  (Days 57 through 84),  
participants in Cohort 1 (stimulant) will continue 
to receive their current stimulant plus  the 
addition of  AKL-T01. Participants in Cohort 2 (n o 
stimulant) will just receive AKL-T01.  For both 
cohorts, during this time the caretakers will 
monitor their child’s symptoms daily with AKL -
X01 
 
Objectives:  
  Primary:  To understand the synergistic  effect s of 
combining AKL -T01 (with AKL -X01 symptom 
tracking) as adjunctive treatment to stimulant 
medication  on impairment .  
To understand the effects of AKL -T01 (with AKL -
X01 symptom tracking) treatment in participants 
not recently on stimulant medication  on 
impairment . 
 
Secondary: To understand symptom and 
attentional effects of AKL -T01 (with AKL -X01 
symptom tracking) in all participants (both Cohort 
1 and Cohort 2).  
Exploratory: To understand sustained benefits, 
through reduction of ADHD impairment and symptoms, following one m onth of AKL -T01 
treatment (with AKL -X01 symptom tracking).

Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  [ADDRESS_778232] practice  for its treatment 
includes both pharmacological (usually psychostimulants – methylphenidate or amphetamine) and non -
pharmacological (behavioral or cognitive -behavioral therapy). These treatment modalities have 
demonstrated incontrovertible short -term benefits across core symptoms of ADHD and associated 
impairments. However, there are limitations to current best practices for the treatment of ADHD.  
 
Pharmacological interventions are accompanied by [CONTACT_590511], do not normalize 
functioni ng, and adherence rates over time are generally low. The latter aspect is likely because  longer -
term benefits of medication for ADHD are modest. Longitudinal studies have shown that acute improvements in ADHD symptoms and functioning are not maintained bey ond [ADDRESS_778233] -party payers.  
 Given these limitations to current stan dards of care, there is a strong need for the development of 
additional intervention s for ADHD that can be easily and widely disseminated. Given the central role of 
attention and other aspects of cognition in the pathophysiology of ADHD, interventions that  specifically 
target these constructs in safe and effective ways are particularly needed.  
 While a previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] (FDA Registration)  trial demonstrated efficacy and safety of AKL -T01 in children 
not currently taking psychostimulants, much is still unkno wn about the effect of AKL -T01 on symptoms 
and impairments of children currently treated with psychostimulants. Specifically, it is unknown whether 
AKL-T01 offers additional clinical benefit  to patients who are treated with stimulants. In addition, little is 
known about the sustained effects of AKL -T01 in either stimulant -treated or untreated children. 
Examining the durability of treatment effects of AKL -T01 will be important for patients and their 
families, providers, and payers. Relatedly, it is not currently known how additional treatment cycles with AKL-T01 following the initial [ADDRESS_778234] of AKL -T01 in children with ADHD who are currently treated  – but inadequately 
managed  – with psychostimulants.  Participants will receive AKL -T01 for approximately 25-30 minutes 
per day , 5 days per week , over a 4 -week treatment period, for two treatment periods separated by a 
one-month break. Change in Baseline on the IRS  (Clinician Report) will serve as the primary outcome 
variable and will allow for a determination of whether AKL -T01 significantly improves impairments in 
pediatric patients with ADHD. Secondary measures will include measures of ADHD symptoms, objective measures of attention, and measures of participant  and parent/caregiver experience and preference.  
  
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  17 2.2 BACKGROUND   
Front -line treatment for ADHD includes the use of stimulant medications, which is effective in reducing 
core symptoms of the disorder but are associated with well- documented side effects. In addition, there 
is recent evidence that pharmacological treatment  may not show optimal benefits in some cognitive 
domains (Biederman, et al 2015). Computerized cognitive training programs have shown some promise 
in improving  working memory and attention in ADHD populations (Klingberg,  et al 2005). Further 
research is needed to validate the effectiveness of currently available computerized cognitive interventions as well as consumer-grade gamified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_185322].  
 This protocol will evaluate the effects of a novel, highly -immersive, videogame -based intervention for 
ADHD as adjunctive treatment  to stimulants while also providing a mobile app to track symptoms . AKL -
T01 was derived from a comparable cognitive training program shown to have robust effects on working memory, attention, and related constructs in older adults (Anguera, et al 2013). AKL -T01 is deployed on 
mobile devices (i.e. tablets) and incorporates adaptive, simultaneous cognitive tasks in a consumer-
grad e action videogame- like platform with high- quality graphics and reward mechanisms.  
 
Novel, cost -effective, non -pharmacological interventions for ADHD which are eas y to implement and 
disseminate could be helpful for many participants given  the limitation s of other approved 
interventions.  
 
Most relevant to the current protocol is the recently -completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_590494] -ADHD ; a multi -
center, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled study comparing AKL -T01 treatment to  the use of 
EVO Words active control  in 348 pediatric participants  (180 participants  were randomized into AKL -T01, 
and 168 into the control group  EVO Words) ages [ADDRESS_778235] 
been (a) currently off ADHD medication or (b) currently receiving ADHD medication but inadequately 
managed on their current stimulant dose per investigator’s judgment and willing to discontinue ADHD 
medica tion for the study.  
 
Participants were asked to engage in AKL -T01 treatment at home for 25 minutes per day, 5 days per 
week, for 4 weeks. Participants were assessed using the TOVA, ADHD -RS, IRS, and BRIEF.  
 The study successfully demonstrated a statistically significant impr ovement  (p=0.006) between AKL -T01 
and EVO Words on the primary endpoint (TOVA -API [INVESTIGATOR_590495] -Treatment) ( STARS -
ADHD, in progress ). This improvement in TOVA -API [INVESTIGATOR_590496] a 
clinically meaningful benefit for AKL -T01 participants . This conclusion is supported by [CONTACT_590512], which all consistently trended towards improv ement.   In this study, AKL -T01 
demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no serious adverse events observed.

OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINT S 
Primary    
Cohort 1: To understand the synergistic 
impairment effects when combining AKL -
T01 (with AKL-X01 symptom tracking) as 
adjunctive treatment  to stimulant  
medication .  
 
Cohort 2: T o understand the impairment 
effects of AKL -T01 (with AKL -X01 symptom 
tracking)  treatment  in participants  not 
recently on stimulant medication . 
 Cohort 1, Cohort 2:  1) Overall change in clinician -
reported Impairment Rating 
Scale (IRS) “Overall severity of child’s problem in functioning 
and overall need for 
treatment” score from baseline to Day 28.  
 Cohort 1: The overall change in 
Impairment Rating Scale  
(Clinician Report)  from baseline 
to Day 28, in participants on 
stimulant medication, will 
demonstrate the overall effect 
that AKL- T01 has on ADHD 
related impairments when administered in addition to 
stimulant medication.  The IRS 
score measures the effects on individualized functional impairments.  
 
Cohort 2: The overall change in 
IRS (Clinician Report) from 
baseline to Day 28, in participants not currently on stimulant medication, will demonstrate the 
overall effect that AKL -T01 has on 
ADHD related impairments when 
administered without stimulant

mobile app -based symptom tracking) on ADHD symptoms and impairments in children currently on or 
off stimulant.  
 
Two hundred and three  participants (203) at multiple sites will be enrolled  into [ADDRESS_778238] been stable ** on stimulant (s) for at least 30  days before baseline . At screening (at  
least 7 and up to 30 days before baseline ), participant caregivers will be instructed to download AKL -X01 
on to their smartphone. Caregivers will use AKL -X01 for tracking participants ’ symptoms and behaviors 
beginning between days - 30 and - 7, through day 84.  During Treatment Phase 1, Days 1 through 28, 
participants will continue receiving stimulant and will also receive AKL-T01 treatment. During the 1 -
month  treatment pause, Days 29 through 56, participants will continue  receiv ing stimulant  but will 
discontinue AKL -T01.  During Treatmen t Phase 2, Days 57 through 84, participants will continue receiv ing 
stimulant and will also receive AKL-T01 treatment. 
**Note: Medication stability is defined as:  
• Moderate response on stimulant, but still room for improvement  
• Dose unchanged within past [ADDRESS_778239] been tried previously without 
improvement  
• Currently taking stimulant, but  parent and/or caregiver wishes not to increase dosage for any 
reason  
• Taking consistent stimulant dose on weekdays, but not on weekends  
 
The hypothesis for Cohort [ADDRESS_778240] been stable without any stimulant for ≥ 30 days before baseline . At screening (a t least 
7 and up to 30 days before baseline ), participant caregivers will be instructed to download AKL -X01 on 
to their smartphone . Caregivers will use AKL -X01 for tracking participant symptoms and behaviors 
beginning between days - 30 and - 7, through day 84. During Treatment Phase 1, Days 1 through 28, 
participants will receive AKL -T01 treatm ent. During the 1 -month treatment pause, Days 29 through 56, 
participants will discontinue AKL -T01. During Treatment Phase 2, Days 57 through 84, participants will 
receive AKL -T01 treatment. 
 The hypothesis for Cohort 2 is that children receiving AKL-T01 treatment will improve in ADHD 
symptoms and impairments from Day 0 to Day 28.  
 All study visits for each participant should be completed during the same time of day (either AM or PM), 
to maintain consistent data collection and comparison of rater assessment results.  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  22 4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE STUDY DESIGN  
The Akili -001R trial focused on randomizing participants , into the blinded study , who were not currently 
being prescribed a stimulant medication regimen for the treat ment of ADHD. Participants were 
evaluated for changes in ADHD symptoms after 28 days of treatment with AKL -T01. The results of the 
Akili- 001R trial showed a marked improvement in ADHD symptoms  in participants, ages 8 -12 years, who 
were not currently prescribed stimulant medication(s).  
 
Four post -hoc analyses were  of interest in the Akili- 001R trial. First, an analysis using the Wilcoxon 
signed -rank test was used to determine whether the baseline and 28 -day API [INVESTIGATOR_590497]. The resulting p -value was less than 0.0001 for AKL-T01 (EVO: Multitask) and 0.67 for 
placebo ( EVO: Words ). This result supports the observation that the mean improvement is higher for 
treatment than the control group. The second post -hoc analysis was to investigate whether there was 
an int eraction between treatment and ADHD type (inattentive vs combined). There was no evidence of a 
clinically relevant interaction between treatment and either subgroup (all p -values were  > 0.13), 
indicating a consistency of response irrespective of ADHD type.  The third analysis using the Wilcoxon 
signed -rank test was used to determine whether the baseline and 28 -day API [INVESTIGATOR_590498]. The resulting p -value was 0.0003 for AKL-T01 and 
0.40 for placeb o. This suppo rts the observed means for the ADHD inattentive subgroup. Lastly, an 
alternative responder analysis was performed where a responder was a 30% reduction in API. The 
analysis showed there was an absolute 14.2% more responders in the treatment arm than the control arm (p = 0.0038).  
 The responder results from the Akili -001R trial led to interest in the hypothesis that AKL -T01 
administered adjunctively with stimulant medication(s) in participants (ages 8  years 0 months -14 years  9 
months ) with ADHD may also improve the symptoms of ADHD.  
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
The therapeutic play regimen for the current study (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 25 minutes per day; 5 days per week; 4 
weeks) was established based on previous work with AKL -T01 digital treatment. Specifically,  a recent 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_590499] -T01 demonstrated that this regimen resulted in significant improvements in TOVA 
API [INVESTIGATOR_185330] a sample of children with similar characteristics as proposed in this study . The mean  
compliance for this regimen is 86% (STARS -ADH D).

Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  25 5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERAT IONS  
During this study , participants and parents/ caregivers will be asked to:  
 Remain on an unchanged dosage of stimulant medication (and stimulant booster, if applicable) 
during participation in the trial, ( Cohort 1 ). 
 Refrain from beginning any treatment with  medication during participation in the trial,  (Cohort 
2).  
 Complete gameplay of AKL -T01 for 25 minutes (consecutively) per day, for 5 days each week 
during the treatment periods . 
 Return to the in -clinic visits (Day 28 and Day 84) with the iPad Mini (and iPad charger) that was 
programmed with their AK L-T01 treatment.  Note: On Day 28 the clinical site will return the iPad 
to Akili for the 1 month break period  and will receive the same device from Akili in advance of Day 
56 for redistribution to the participant for Treatment Phase II.  
 
During this study, parents and/or caregivers of participants are asked to:  
 Complete evaluation of the participant’s ADHD symptoms daily (5 days per week)  using the AKL -
X01 smartphone app . Efforts should be made so that the evaluations are  completed at the end of 
each day, to capture behavior(s) from the entire day.  All parents and/or caregivers of participants 
(study -wide) should complete these evaluations at the same time each day.  
 Return to the in -clinic visits with their smartphone and demonstrate they are using t he AKL -X01 
symptom tracker as described above  to the study staff .  
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES

Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  27 6 STUDY INTERVENTION 
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_778246] loops, and real- time adaptive mechanics to dynamically personalize difficulty 
based on the user’s ability. AKL -T01 multitasking treatment employs perceptual discrimination 
attention/memory task as well as a continuous moto r “drivin g” task. Performance on these tasks are 
assessed in isolation and whe n performed together to calculate a performance index for each individual 
user. A perso nalized multitask treatment regimen is automatically configured and delivered to the user 
and is optimized adaptively to increase multitask ing performance. As players proceed through the 
treatment periodic recalibration occurs to maintain an optimal difficulty level.  
 
AKL-T01 treatment will be loaded by [CONTACT_456] (Akili Interactive Labs) onto iPad Mini 4 tablets. The 
iPads are configured to minimize the participants’ ability to utilize non -study related applications. 
Features such as brow sing the internet, downloading apps, deleting apps, and messaging are restricted. 
The study devices are not intended to be used for any purpose other than that outlined in this protocol. 
Site staff will instruct participants and parents on intended and unintended use, as o utline d in this 
protocol. The iPads, along with chargers, will be provided by [CONTACT_407716]. In a separate document, a list of login credentials (participant  usernames and passwords) will be provided.   
 
Participants will be assigned one  iPad Mini [ADDRESS_778247] clinical raters’ access to participant compliance data rep orts. 
Sites should identify a separate staff member to receive and review participant compliance data reports.  
 
Additionally, bias opportunities should be minimized by [CONTACT_590513]. Every effort 
should be made, throughout the course of the trial, to maintain the consistency of rating staff among participants.  
 
Also, to minimize the unintentional bias of study data and to maintain data consistency, clinical rater 
assessments for each participant should be completed at the same time of day throughout the course of 
the study.  
Also, all attempts should be made to ensure that the same parent/caregiver completes 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  28 the outcome measures.  Also, all attempts should be made to ensure that the sa me study staff 
administers the subjective clinical outcome measures (ADHD -RS, CGI, and IRS).  
 
All parents and/or caregivers of participants should complete the daily Fengo  app assessment five days 
per week, at the end of each day, to ensure that the entire day’s behavior(s) are captured. All parents 
and/or caregivers of participants (study -wide) should complete the Fengo assessment at the same time 
of day each day.  
 All ADHD -RS, MINI -KID and IRS -Clinician clinical assessments MUST  be completed by a trained  clinician, 
to maintain data consistency.  
 
6.3 STUDY INTERVENTION C OMPLIANCE  
AKL-T01 automatically captures gameplay compliance and uploads these data directly to a central server 
when connected to WiFi. The server will automatically push daily compliance emails to the clinical sites 
(the format of which is described in a separate document). Based on these emails, study staff can then reach out to parents /caregivers  (via the preferred contact [CONTACT_590514]) to troubleshoot technical problems and/or encourage more play. The rule for compliance outreach follow:  
 
1. Participants that fail to play any sessions of AKL-T01 over two consecutive days will be contact[CONTACT_590515]. These participants will be highlighted in yellow in the daily compliance emails.  
2. Participants that fail to play at least [ADDRESS_778248] 12 sessions of AKL -T01 over 14 days will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] a 
second time and reminded to play more. These participants will be highlighted red in the daily complian ce emails. 
 
Additionally, AKL -T01 contains built -in features that remind the participant to play each day.  
 
6.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 If the participant is enrolled into Cohort 1 (stimulant): Stimulant  medication prescribed for the 
treatment of ADHD symptoms, provided that the participant’s dosage has been stable ** for ≥  30 
days prior to Baseline . Participant’s stimulant medication dosage should remain stable during the 
course of the trial, as much as p ossible . Any titrations (including switching medications) of the 
participant’s stimulant medication during the course of their participation in the trial will be 
documented within the eCRFs.  
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  29               **Note: Medication stability is defined as:  
• Moderat e response on stimulant, but still room for improvement  
• Dose unchanged within past [ADDRESS_778249] been tried previously 
without improvement  
• Taking stimulant, but parent and/or caregiver wishes not to increase dosage for any 
reason  
• Taking con sistent stimulant dose on weekdays, but not on weekends . 
 
Note: Stimulant medication(s) are expected to be managed by [CONTACT_105] -study clinicians (unless the 
site PI/Sub -I is the participant’s provider) .  
 With the exception of common over the counter (OTC) (e.g. ibuprofen, acetaminophen , non -
sedating antihistamines to treat seasonal allergies) and prescription medications (e.g. antibiotics) 
for minor transient ailments, regular use of concomitant medications is  not permitted during the 
study. Daily  use of some med ications (i.e., non -sedating antihistamines to treat seasonal allergies) 
may be permitted on a case -by-case basis with PI [INVESTIGATOR_345]/approval documented . Families should 
advise the study staff if it becomes necessary to use other types of medication.  Study 
investigators can approve short -term use of other medications that are not anticipated to 
confound study assessments.  
 Initiation of or significant changes in non- pharmacological treatment for ADHD is not permitted 
during the course of the study. Participants  actively engaged in non -pharmacological treatment 
at Screening may be eligible if they meet all inclusion criteria and do not undergo changes to their 
treatment during the course of the study.  
 
Allowed Medications:  
1) Stimulant medication(s) , including formulaic variants  of amp hetamines and/or 
methylphenidates , which are currently FDA approved for prescribed treatment of 
pediatric ADHD (if participant is enrolled into Cohort 1) .

necessary) if the participant  is noncompliant with their assigned treatment (as described below ) or 
otherwise violates the study plan, or for administrative and/or other safety reason.  
The investigator or designee will notify the sponsor or their designee immediately when a participant  
has been discontinued or withdrawn from study treatment because of an adverse event . When a 
participant  discontinues or is withdrawn from treatment before study completion, all applicable  
activities scheduled for the final study visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation. Any 
adverse events  that are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be reported and 
followed up in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section  8.3 (Adverse Events) . 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study treatment non-compliance , defined as <50% compliance with study treatment  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), or other medical condition or situation occurs such that 
continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• Disease progression worsening, which requires discontinuation of the study treatment  
• If the participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Participant unable to receive AKL -T01 for 25 minutes per day, 5 days  per week, as prescribed per 
protoc ol. 
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the trial’s 
electronic  Case Report Form ( eCRF). Participants  who sign the informed consent form and are enrolled 
but do not receive the study treatment  will not  be replaced.  Participants  who sign the informed consent 
form, and are enrolled and receive the study treatment, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn 
or discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  [ADDRESS_778251] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required s tudy visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact [CONTACT_62541] a one 
week window of the missed visit  and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining 
the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the particip ant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up. 
 
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  33 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENTS  
Effectiveness  assessments will include the following instruments:  
• Impairment Rating Scale  
• ADHD -RS-IV 
• CGI-I 
• TOVA -9 
• ToSREC  
• MFaCTs  
Every effort must be made to ensure that raters of all rating scales/assessments are kept consistent 
among participants throughout trial participation. Each rating scale/assessment for the participant should be administered by [CONTACT_590516]. If a rater leaves a clinical site for 
any reason the site should replace the rater as quickly as possible, and this replacement rater will also be expected to complete rater training (if not previously trained). The replacement rater should review the participant’s source documents for previously completed rating assessments, in an effort to become familiar with the former rater’s evaluations.  
 
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
Safety assessments will include the evaluation of adverse device events (A DEs). 
 
8.3 ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS, SEVE RITY, AND REPORTING  
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E DEVICE EFFECTS (ADE)  
An ADE is an adverse event related to  the use of an investigational medical device . This includes any 
adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use, the deployment, the implementation , the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical 
device. This also includes any event that is a result of a use r error or intentional misuse.  
 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED ADVERS E DEVICE EFFECTS (UA DE) 
Per [ADDRESS_778252], 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants. 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  will include events meeting BOTH A and B  as stated below:  
A. Events meeting ALL of the fo llowing criteria:  
1) Not included in the list of Anticipated Events (refer to protocol Section 8.3.3) 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  34 2) Possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational device ( per the sponsor)  
B. Serious (meets any  of the following criteria):  
1) Is life -threatening  illness or injury  
2) Results in permanent impairment of a body structure or a body structure  
3) Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent * impairment of a 
body function or a body structure . (*Permanent*  is defined as irreversible impairment 
or damage to a body structure or function, excluding trivial impairment or damage)  
4) Leads to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
5) Leads to death . 
 
8.3.3 PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ADV ERSE DEVICE EFFECTS  
AKL-T01 (instructions for use) ....The expectedness of an ADE shall be determined according to the 
specified reference document containing safety information ( e.g., Instructions for Use) and the expected 
ADEs listed below.  Any ADE that is not identified in nature, severity, or specific ity in the current 
investigational product reference documents is considered unanticipated.  
 
Adverse Device Effects expected for this device are as follows:  
 Dizziness  
 Nausea  
 Headache  
 Decreased frustration tolerance  
 Emotional reaction  
 
8.3.4 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
The following guidelines will be used to describe the severity  of an A DE:  
 
 Mild : Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated.  
 Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant 
intervention.  
 Severe: Incapacitating , with  an inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical 
status and warrants intervention.  Please note: the term “severe” is not the same as “serious”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHI P TO STUDY TREATMENT  
All ADEs must have their relationship to study treatment assessed by [CONTACT_501520]/her clinical judgment. In a clinical trial, the investigational device must always be suspe ct. The degree of certainty of causal relationship of an 
adverse device effect of either study treatment will be rated as follows : 
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  35  Possible: An event that might be due to the use of the study device. An alternative explanation - 
e.g., concomitant drug(s),  concomitant disease(s) - is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore the causal relationship cannot be excluded.  
 Probable: An event that might be due to the use of the study device. An alternative explanation 
is less likely - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is 
suggestive.  
 Definitely: An event that is due to the use of the study device. The event cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_4867] - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concom itant disease(s).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The DCRI Safety Medical Monitor  will be responsible for determining whether an A DE is expected or 
unexpected  for events meeting serious criteria. An A DE will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of  the event is not consistent with the risk information previousl y described for 
the study treatment. 
 
8.3.5 TIME PERIOD AND FREQ UENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND 
FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an ADE  may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All ADEs  including local and systemic reactions will be captured on the appropriate  case report form  
(CRF). Information to be collected includes the event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a 
diagnosis), and time of reso lution/stabilization of the event. All ADEs  occurring while in the  study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All ADEs  will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an ADE . However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an ADE .  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. ADEs  characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The Site Pri ncipal Investigator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring from the time 
of enrollment through the final study visit (Day 84).  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire 
about the occurrence of ADEs  since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until 
resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_778253]  assess the relationship of the event to the investigational 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  36 device (including rationale for assessment) and should make every attempt to obtain as much 
information as possible concerning the event.  Additional information pertaining to an event should be reported in the EDC as it becomes available.  
 
The investigator must report, via IBM Clinical Development EDC database, all a dverse device effects 
(anticipated or unanticipated)  that meet serious criteria occurring  from the time of enrollment  through 
the final study visit ( Day 84) within [ADDRESS_778254] report, via IBM Clinical Development EDC database , when important follow -up 
information (final diagnosis, outcome, results of specific investigations, etc.) becomes available after 
submission of the initial ADE form and information. Follow -up information should be submitted 
according to the same process used for reporting the initial event as described above (i.e., within 24 hours of knowledge, via IBM Clinical Development EDC database ). All adverse device effects will be 
followed through resolution.   
 DCRI Safety Surveillance will report all adverse device effects to specified trial personnel (sponsor,  
protocol principal investigator [PI] and project leader)  within 1  to 2 business days of receipt.
  
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLE MS 
 
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protection s (OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the r esearch procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459])  
 Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.  
 Unanticipated adverse device effect, any serious adverse effect on health or safety or 
any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or deg ree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants   
 Examples of pot ential Unanticipated Problems include, but are not limited to:  
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  37 1) Unanticipated misuse of device hardware  
2) Unanticipated misuse of device software  
3) Unanticipated hardware issues  
4) Unanticipated software issues.  
8.4.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing  IRB and t o the DCRI Safety 
Surveillance /lead principal investigator ( PI). The UP report will include the following information:  
 Protocol -identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB 
project number  
 Detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
 Explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP   
 Description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
An investigator shall submit to the sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a report of any unanticipated 
device problem occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, b ut in no event later than [ADDRESS_778255] under 812.46(b) shall report the results of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Ad ministration ( FDA) and to all reviewing IRBs and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_778256] as FDA requests.    
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  38 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
This section provides a brief overview of the statistical analyses, both quantitative and qualitative in 
nature  that will be used during this study.  In addition to what follows in this section, further details will 
be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
 The primary objectives of this study are to (1) understand the synergistic impairment effects when 
combining AKL -T01 (with app -based symptom tracking, AKL -X01) as adjunctive t reatment to stimulant 
medication, and (2) understand the impairment effects of AKL -T01 (with app -based symptom tracking, 
AKL-X01) treatment in participants not recently on stimulant medication.  W ithin both the medicated 
and non -medicated cohorts, a change in Impairment Rating Scale (IRS)  (Clinician Report)  from baseline 
to Day [ADDRESS_778257] that AKL -T01 treatment has on ADHD symptoms.  
 
The secondary objective of this study is to understand the symptom and attentional effects of AKL -T01 
(with app -based symptom tracking AKL -X01) treatment in all participants.  There is an additional 
exploratory objective which focuses specifically on sustained benefits, through reduction of ADHD 
symptoms  and impairment , experienced by [CONTACT_590517] (a) 1 -month of treatment with AKL -
T01, and (b) a n additional 4 weeks of AKL-T01 treatment.  
 
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
The aim of the primary objective is to demonstrate a statistically significant difference on mean change in IRS  “Overall severity of child’s problem in functioning and overall need for treatment”  score, defined 
for each participant as the score  measured on Day [ADDRESS_778258] evaluated at the 95% level of confidence.  The 
formulation of the null ( H
0) and alternative ( Ha) hypotheses are stated below, where μ d refers to the true 
mean difference:  
• H0: μd = 0 
• Ha: μd ≠ 0. 
 
If, within a particular cohort, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the s ample 
difference is smaller than 0, we will have sufficient evidence to reject H [ADDRESS_778259].  Significance will be 
determined by [CONTACT_62085] W -statistic at the 95% level of confidence.  
 
 
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  39 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
Sample size estimates were computed by [CONTACT_590518]  (Machin, Campbell, Fayers, & and 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_164998], 1997)  (Zar, 1984) .  Assuming a standard deviation of 1, we determined that an effective total of at 
least 117 medicated participants (C ohort 1) would be needed to demonstrate an effect size of 0.30 with 
90% power at the 95% level of confidence using a within -group t-test.  Similarly, at least 66 non -
medicated participants (Cohort 2) would be needed to demonstrate an effect size of 0.40 wi th 90% 
power and 95% confidence.  Incorporating a 10% dropout requires that at least 130 + 73 = [ADDRESS_778260] deviations.  In all cases, we 
assume 90% power and 95% confidence.  The rows used to inform enrollment size for this tria l have been 
highlighted in gray.

9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
There are 3 populations defined for this study: intention -to-treat (ITT); per -protocol (PP); and, safety.  
The ITT and PP populations will be used for efficacy analyses, and the safety population will be used for 
the safety analysis.  The success of the primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be determined within the ITT po pulation.  
 
9.3.1 INTENTION- TO-TREAT ( ITT)  
This population is defined as any participant enrolled in the study who receives a device.  In the event that a medicated participant ’s clinician deems it necessary to end medication treatment (or vice versa), 
no correct ion will be made to that participant ’s cohor t.  Unless otherwise indicated, the ITT population 
will be used for all statistical analyses, tabular summaries, and data listings.
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  [ADDRESS_778261] 50% of all possible epi[INVESTIGATOR_590500] (see Section 6.3 of this document for additional details ). 
 
Additionally, the following participants will be excluded from the PP population:  
• Participants in Cohort 1 who discontinue medication  (or changed medication dosing/type) and 
participants in Cohort 2 who begin medication after the  baseline visit but before Day 28 (i.e., 
crossovers)  
• Participants who used prohibited/exclusionary medication or other treatments for ADHD during 
the course of the trial.  
 
9.3.3 SAFETY  
This population is defined as any participant enrolled in the study who recei ves a device.  At any time 
during the study, if a participant’s clinician deems it necessary to end medication treatment, or, conversely, to begin treatment, that participant’s cohort will be determined based on where the participant spent the majority of the first treatment phase (the tiebreaker will be cohort the participant 
belonged to on Day 28).  
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH  
All continuous variables will be summarized as means (standard deviations), medians (25th and 75th 
percentiles), minimu m and maximum.  The number and percentage of participants in each category will 
be presented for categorical variables.  Shift tables may be used to compare baseline and post -baseline 
assessments involving categorical variables.  
 
Statistical comparisons of continuous variables within each of the two cohorts will be performed using a 
paired t-test, with a Box -Cox transformation applied to induce normality if necessary ; comparisons of 
categorical variables will be performed using the  Pearson’s chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test 
depending on expected cell sizes.   Statistical normality will be assessed using a Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test, and 
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_590519] c figures .  Unless otherwise indicated, 
com parisons will always use a two -sided significance test at the 95% level of confidence.  
 
All analyses will be conducted using a complete case analysis.  In no situation will missing data be 
imputed.  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  41 Analyses will be performed using SAS software version 9.2  or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  
 
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
The primary efficacy endpoint for each participant is the change in IRS  score  from baseline to Day 28, 
defined as  the score on Day [ADDRESS_778262] for the primary efficacy analysis, although additional analyses may be 
requested at the discretion of the investigators.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
 
The results of the primary efficacy analysis will be summarized by [CONTACT_590520] (95% 
confidence interval) and p -value.  If the upper bo und of the 95% confidence interval is smaller than [ADDRESS_778263] party, with confirmation 
coming f rom the PI.  If outliers are identified for a given endpoint, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed without the outlier. 
 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested using the same technique outlined f or the 
primary efficacy analysis: (1) change in sum of ADHD -RS component scores from baseline to Day 28; (2) 
CGI-I score at Day 28; and, (3) change in TOVA ACS and certain constituents, from baseline to Day 28.  
The ITT population will be used for all secondary efficacy endpoints with the same analyses being 
repeated on the per -protocol population.  
Family -wise error rate will be controlled using a hierarchical testing strategy.  Within each cohort, the 
maximum allowable Type I error rate will be set to 0.05 . 
If the primary efficacy endpoint is significant at the 0.05 confidence level, the secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order in which they appear above, starting with (1) change in autocalculated sum of ADHD -RS Total.  If the test for (1) is significant at the 0.[ADDRESS_778264] for (2) CGI -I score at Day [ADDRESS_778265] for (2) is significant at the 0.[ADDRESS_778266] for (3) change in TOVA constituents from baseline to Day 28 will procee d, starting with Ex -
Gaussian Tau Total, and then to API/ACS, Commission Errors Standard Score H2, RT Variability Standard Score Total, RT Mean Standard Score H1, D -Prime Standard Score H2, and Omission Errors Standard 
Score H2, in this order.  At any point, if the test of a secondary efficacy endpoint fails to achieve significance at the 0.05 confidence level, only nominal p -values will be reported for that endpoint and 
for all subsequent secondary efficacy endpoints.  
If the primary efficacy endpoint is not  significant at the 0.05 confidence level, only nominal p -values will 
be reported for all secondary efficacy endpoints.  
 
Confidential  Version 2.0/27Feb2019  42 9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES  
Serious adverse device events for both cohorts will be presented.  Any adverse events occurring during 
any phase of the  study judged by [CONTACT_590521] (PIs) to be related to the device will 
be recorded and presented in a listing using the safety population.  A tabular summary of adverse events by [CONTACT_590522].  The severity of each event will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_590501].  
 
9.4.5 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTI CS 
Tabular outputs and/or listings will be provided at all available timepoints (baseline, Day 28, Day 56, Day 84) for the following outcomes: (1) AKL -T01 and AKL -X01 actual usage; (2) participant preference

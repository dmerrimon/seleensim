Rationale for this Study:  
Advanced gastric cancer continues to account for a large proportion of  worldwide cause s of 
cancer-related mortality . Systemic and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_705799], though the immune 
checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab became FDA -approved in September of [ADDRESS_959097] -line 
and beyon d therapy based on results of the KEYNOTE -059 trial.1 However, durable objective 
responses remains limited to a small proportion of patients . The IRX-2 Regimen is an 
immunomodulatory regimen in development by [CONTACT_705825] a 
novel primary cell -derived biologic (IRX -2) that contains several active cytokines and 
cyclophosphamide. This treatment regimen has been demonstrated to bolster several facets of 
immune response, including tumor infilt ration by [CONTACT_24495].2-7 Therefore, it is possible that 
the combination of the IRX -2 regimen wi th pembrolizumab  will improve treatment outcomes.  
This phase 1b /[ADDRESS_959098] criteria , and 
resultant median progression -free and overall survival. Explorato ry analyses will seek to 
evaluate the following: circulating T cell profile in patients before and after treatment with the 
IRX-2 regimen ; the baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue for Nanostring gene expression 
profiling and correlation of these profil es to putative response ; multiplex assays (MHC-PepSeq) 
in combination with genomic and transcriptomic sequencing to identify mutations associated 
with tumor neo -antigens; and other circulating biomarkers (other immune cell populations and 
circulating tumor  DNA) in peripheral blood to develop hypotheses for response to these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Objectives: 
Primary Objectives  
 
 
4 
 
 •  To determine the safety profile of the combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab  
Secondary Objectives  
•  To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX -[ADDRESS_959099] criteria . 
•  To evaluate initial m edian progression -free and overall survival in these patients treated 
with combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab.  
Exploratory Objectives  
•  To evaluate the circulating T cell  profiles in patients before and after therapy with the 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab  
•  To evaluate the baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue immune gene expression 
profiling using the Nanostring platform  
•  To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic 
assay (MHC -PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing  
•  To explore  putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor DNA and immune cell 
profiles) in peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to treatment with 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizum ab.  
Study Design:  
The study will consis t of two phases – a safety phase and a dose expansion phase:  
 
•  Safety phase (phase 1b) : A standard 3+3 dose finding rule will be employed  with two dose 
levels.  Patients will start at dose level 1  [IRX-2 regimen at dose of 2 mL (230 units/day)] . 
Patients will be enrolled in cohort s of 3, separated by [CONTACT_2669]  1 week.  Initially, 3 patients 
will be treated with expansion to 3 more patients in the event of 1/3 dose limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) as observ ed during the first 3  weeks of treatment, escalation if 0/3 or 1/6 
DLTs, and termination of escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs.  Once ≥ [ADDRESS_959100] been treated at the dose level. The maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose tested in which only 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable 
patients experience a DLT.  The Recommended Phase 2 Dosing (RP2D)  will not exceed the 
MTD but may be lower based o n cumulative toxicities and dose modification patterns.  If 
the rules suggest escalation at the highest proposed dose, that dose will accrue to 6 
patients where <2 DLTs will determine that as the MTD, and 2 or more DLTs will require 
de-escalation. These ru les will be used to determine the IRX -2 regimen dosing for the 
expansion phase .  
•  Dose expansion phase  (phase 2): 8-14 patients will be enrolled at the recommended dos e 
level from the safety  phase, for a t otal enrollment of 20 patients.  The 6-12 patients 
treated in the safety lead -in portion of the study will be counted as part of the dose 
expansion patient population.  
Endpoints: 
Primary Endpoint  
•  Occurrence and severity of adverse events including dose limiting toxicities, with severity 
determined according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. 
Secondary Endpoints  
 
 
5 
 
 •  Progression Free Survival (PF S), Overall Survival (OS) , and Overall Response Rate (ORR) as  
assessed using RECIST version 1.[ADDRESS_959101] . 
Exploratory Endpoints  
•  Description of circulating T cell  profiles in patients b efore and after therapy with 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab .  
•  Correlation between baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue  Nanostring gene expression 
profiling and clinical  response.  
•  Identification of tumor neoantigens using the MHC -PepSeq assay.  
•  Development of hypotheses for response based on circulating immune cel l profiles 
circulating tumor DNA from  peripheral blood.  
Sample Size:  
Phase I:  6-12 patients 
Phase II: 20 patients (1 1 + 9 or 8 + 12)* 
* Patients treated at all dose levels in the phase I portion of the study will be counted as a part 
of the phase II patient population.

[ADDRESS_959112]  and Reference Therapy:  
IRX-2 is supplied as a pale yellow, sterile liquid for subcutaneous injection in a 2.0 ml single dose 
vial.  
Pembrolizumab  as a 200 mg IV Q3weeks as a 3 0 minute infusion  
 
Cycle 1 through 35 
Pembrolizumab  as a 200 mg IV Q3weeks as a 30 minute infusion (every Cycle)  
IRX-2 regimen every 12 wee ks as below starting on Cycle 1:  
Agent Dose Route of Administration  
Cyclophosphamide (Day 1)  300 mg/m2 IV 
IRX-2: For 10 days starting on 
Day 4; the 10 days are not 
required to be consecutive 
(e.g. dosing not mandatory on 
weekends/holidays) provided 
dosing is completed by [CONTACT_2006] 15  Dose Level 1:  
230 units total daily 
(2 injections daily 
comprised of 115 units  in 
each injection ) 
 
Dose Level 2: 
460 units total daily 
(4 injections daily 
comprised of 115 units in 
each injection ) Dose Level 1:  Subcutaneous at or 
near the supraclavicular lymph 
node regions bilaterally  
(substitute axillary if 
supraclavicular nodes have been 
removed). 
 
Dose level 2: Subcutaneous  at or 
near the supraclavicular and 
axillary node regions bilaterally  
(if any of these nodes have been 
removed, can inject at or near 
mastoid insertion of both 
sternocleidomastoid muscles ). 
 
 
 Statistical Considerations:  
The safety phase of the study will enroll [ADDRESS_959113] 80% power to detect 
median differences in PFS.  Assuming that dose level 1 will be used for the dose expansion phase, 
these individuals will be included in phase II to reach the needed sample of 20 patients evaluable 
for immune activity.

 1.0  Goals and Objectives (Scientific Aims)  
Primary Objectives  
•  To determine the safety profile of combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab  
Secondary Objectives  
•  To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX -[ADDRESS_959118] criteria . 
•  To evaluate initial median progression -free and overall survival in these patients treated with 
combination IRX -2 regimen and pembrolizumab.  
Exploratory Objectives  
•  To evaluate the circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after therapy with combination 
IRX-2 regimen and pem brolizumab 
•  To evaluate the baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue immune gene expression profiling 
using the Nanostring platform  
•  To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic assay 
(MHC-PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing   
•  To explore putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor DNA and immune cell profiles) in 
peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to treatment with combination IRX -[ADDRESS_959119] demonstrated activity  in advanced gastric and 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer . These include pl atinum drugs, such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin, 
and fluoropyrimidines, such as intraven ous 5-fluorouracil  and oral capecitabine. Multi-agent 
chemotherapy  regimens are able to  improve by [CONTACT_47071] [ADDRESS_959120] supportive care alone.10 In terms of predictive biomarkers to date t hat guide 
treatment decisions in front -line therapy , evidence of  HER2 overexpression and/or gene amplification 
supports addition of HER2 blockade with trastuzumab to combination platinum and fluoropyrimidine 
chemotherapy based on the phase III ToGA trial .[ADDRESS_959121] activity in randomized trials .12-14 More recently , evidence 
that angiogenesis inhibition can induce tumor responses and/or delay disease progression was 
demonstrated with delivery of the VEGFR2 -inhibitory antibody ramucirumab in the phase II I REGARD 
and RAINBOW trials, when utilized as a  single agent or added to paclitaxel, respectively .15, 16 Median 
overall survival improved from 7.4 to 9.6 months (p=0.017)  when ramucirumab was added to paclitaxel,

prior systemic regimens.1 Pembrolizumab was continued until completion of 35 cycles (approximately 2 
years) in patients wi thout demonstration of progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, or investigator decision to stop therapy. Fuchs et al.  reported those with tumor  PD-L1 
expression had  an overall RR of 15.5% with 2.0% complete responses , and 13.5% partial responses by 
[CONTACT_393]1.1 .  Evidence of PD -L1 expression by a combined positive score (CPS) was defined as a cutoff ≥ 1 
tumor cells and/or immune cells out of 100 viable tumor cells with PD -L1 expression by 
[CONTACT_705828] 22C3 pharmD x assay. Microsatellite instability was also tested as a 
biomarker, and 4% of the study population harbored tumors with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H).  
ORR was more encouraging  at 57.1% in the MSI -H subset vs. 9.0% in tumors defined to be non -MSI-H. 
Ultimately 13 .3% of patients with non -MSI-H or undetermined MSI, PD-L1 CPS positive tumors 
demonstrated objective tumor responses which were durable with median duration s of response 
between 2.3+ to 19.4 + months. While the durability of responses are very encouraging for a disease 
historically with dismal prognosis, the low proportion of patients having such clinical benefit speaks to 
the need to augment immunotherapy responses.   This was further highligh ted by [CONTACT_705829] -[ADDRESS_959123] each other to modulate the immune response .18 This 
relationship is further co mplicated by [CONTACT_705830] -regulate stimulatory signals and 
up-regulate inhibitory signals . Some tumors express Programmed death receptor liga nd 1 (PD-L1) the 
ligand for programmed death -1 (PD-1), a cell surface molec ule that regulates the adaptive immune 
response.19 PD-1 is found on the surface of T cells and sends inhibitory signals that inactivate T cell 
receptor (TCR) signaling up on the binding of PD -L1.20 The interaction of PD -L1 with PD -1 has been shown 
to inhibit the killing activity of cytotoxic T cells as well as interfere with  the role of regulatory T cells .21 
Tumors take advantage of immune checkpoints such as the PD -1/PD-L1 pathway to evade immune 
destruction, resu lting in disease progression. It is necessary to overcome multiple immunosuppressive 
mechanisms  in order to establish an effective antitumor immune response. [ADDRESS_959124].  23, 24 In targeting tumors that express PD -L1, immunoth erapy has been 
used to produce an antibody blockade to the PD -1 receptor on T cells.25 
Pembrolizumab  is a fully human, Ig G4 (kappa) monoclonal antibody  that binds PD-1, which is primarily 
expressed on activated T cells, B cells and myeloid cells.26-[ADDRESS_959125] demonstrated the ability to express PD -L1 
 
 
15 
 
 and binding of PD -1 to PD-L1 or PD-L2 has been shown to down -regulate T -cell activation.32-35 
Interactions between PD -1/PD-L1 may also indirectly modulate the response to tumor antigens throu gh 
T-cell/APC interactions. PD -1 blockade by [CONTACT_20382], pembrolizumab and PD -L1 blockade by 
[CONTACT_705831] T cell effector function in 
several tumor types including melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC), renal cell carcinom a (RCC), 
urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), microsatellite instability -high (MSI-H) colorectal 
cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).28, 36-[ADDRESS_959126]-line treatment of advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma , the 
observed response rate was 15 .5%, indicating the possibility for improvement of this therapy through 
combination with an additional immunomodulatory regimen.   
2.1.4  The IRX-2 Regimen  
The IRX-2 Regimen is an immunomodulatory regimen in development by [CONTACT_705832] a novel primar y cell-derived biologic (IRX -2) and cyclophosphamide. Preclinical studies 
showed that the IRX -2 biologic promotes upregulation of antigen presenting machinery, improved 
antigen presentation, dendritic cell (DC) matura tion, improved T cell activation, and T cell protection 
from extrinsic and intrinsic forms of tumor -induced apoptosis.2-7 Clinical studies evaluating a 3 -week 
cycle of the IRX -2 Regimen in therapy -naïve subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
(HNSCC) intended for curative surgery demonstrated  modest tumor regression with increased 
lymphocyte infiltration into tumors when surgical specimens were compared to pre -treatment biopsies. 
Increase in tumor lymphocyte infiltration  appeared to be associated with better overall survival.43-[ADDRESS_959127] that the IRX 2 Regimen may mobilize tumor -infiltrating effector lymphocytes 
resulting in a clinically significant anti-tumor immune response.  
2.1.5  Manufacture and Composition of the IRX -2 Biologic 
IRX-2 is a primary cell -derived biologic with multiple active cytokine components, produced under 
pharmaceutical standards from phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and ciprofloxacin sti mulated donor 
mononuclear cells. Multiple healthy donor leukocytes (“buffy coats”) are pooled and then stimulated 
with PHA (to mimic a cellular immune challenge), and then locked in pre -s phase by [CONTACT_705833]. 
Subsequently, the PHA, ciprofloxacin and all cellular elements are removed and the cell-free 
supernatant is filter -sterilized, nanofiltered t o clear viral particles, v ialed and frozen as IRX -2. IRX-2 
contains nanogram quantities (physiologic) of IL -1β, IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNFα, and also includes IL -6, IL-8, 
GM-CSF, and G-CSF. Each of these human cytokines when studied individually enhances cell -mediated 
immunity via differ ent mechanisms.  
2.1.6  Modifying the Lymph Node Microenvironment (IRX -2 Biologic)  
The IRX-2 biologic is administered by [CONTACT_705834] -lymphatic area adjacent to 
lymph nodes draining the tumor bed to take advantage of the normal afferent and efferent pathways of 
lymph node activation. The immunosuppressive microenvironment contributes to incomplete or 
ineffective tumor antigen processing in regional lymph nodes. Administering IRX -2 near lymphatic 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_705801], antigen processing, and effector 
T cell activation.  
 
 
16 
 
 2.1.7  Tumor-Induced Immune Suppression  
Tumor-induced immune suppression ranges from tumo rs utilizing immune ch eckpoints (CTLA -4, PD-
1/PD-L1) to production of soluble factors such as IL-10, TGF-β, prostaglandins, vascular endothelia l 
growth factor, and Fas ligand which contribute to depression of cellular immunity by [CONTACT_705835].47-[ADDRESS_959128] suppressor cells of both lymphoid  and myeloid origin including regulatory T cells, 
myeloid suppressor cells, suppressor macrophages and DCs.50-52 
Rationale for Combining the IRX -2 Regimen and Pembrolizumab  in Gastric/GEJ Adenocarcinoma   
Recently it has been shown that the degree of lymphocyte infiltration is an important prognostic factor 
for treatment with anti -PD-1 monoclon al antibodies in melanoma .53 Additionally, it has been well 
established that t he level of T cell infiltration in primary tumor biopsies is a strong predictive factor of 
improved outcome in multivariate analyses for many cancers .54-56 This provides a compelling  basis for 
incorporating tr eatment with the IRX -2 Regimen to increase the level of lympho cyte infiltration in 
tumors with  anti-PD-1 treatments. In a Phase 2  trial, IRX-2 was shown to increase T cell infiltration into 
the tumor and this correlated with overall survival in HNS CC.44, 45 In the Phase 2a study in patients with 
HNSCC, IRX-2 facilitated reductions in circulating B and NKT cell numbers, suggesti ng redistribution of 
these cells to tissues.44 
In pre-clinical models, the IRX -2 Regimen was shown to be superior to recombinant IL -7 and IL-15 in 
protecting T cells from tumor - induced apoptosis  and to be involved in IFN-γ+-driven T cell polarization 
towards Teff and suppression of Treg differentiation  in the tumor microenvironment .4 IRX-2 was 
subsequently shown to restore the fu nction of dendritic cells from head and n eck cancer patients.5 A 
decrease in naïve T cells and unchanged numbers of Tregs (suppressor T cells) after IRX -2 therapy 
indicated that IRX -2 does not expand suppressor T cells thus potentially benefiting anti -tumor immu ne 
responses.44  
As the IRX -2 regimen has been shown to work in an upstream immune -activating manner and PD-1 
inhibitors work downstream by [CONTACT_705836] -induced immune suppression , a combination of such 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_705802] . Pembrolizumab , a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 
antibody that binds to the PD -[ADDRESS_959129]-line treatment of gastroesophageal cancer  although o nly a 13% objective response rate was 
observed in non-MSI-H tumors with positive PD -L1 expression by [CONTACT_705837] (Fuchs ref) . Therefore, it 
is likely that patients with evidence of immune checkpoint expression in the tumor and tumor 
microenvironment woul d benefit from additional  immune system activation in conjunction with 
immune checkpoint inhibition.  With employment of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, indomethacin and 
the need for omeprazole prophylaxis against NSAID -induced gastritis has been deemed un necessary and 
will not be utilized in the trial.  Zinc deficiency and supplementation in the HNSCC trials were unique to 
that patient population, and will also not be utilized in this trial for patients with metastatic 
gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas. 
Overview of Study  
The IRX-2 Regimen is an immunomodulatory regimen in development by [CONTACT_705838] a novel primary cell -derived biologic (IRX -2) that contains several active cytokines and 
cyclophosphamide. This treatment regimen h as been demonstrated to bolster several facets of immune 
 
 
17 
 
 response, including tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_24495].2-7 Therefore, it is possible that the combination of 
the IRX-2 regimen with pembrolizumab  will improve treatment outcomes  in advanced, treatment -
refractory gastric and GEJ adenocarc inoma.

analyses will seek to evaluate the following: circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after 
treatment with the IRX -[ADDRESS_959132]-treatment  tumor tissue for Nanostring gene 
expression profiling and correlation  of these profiles to clinical response and evaluate additional 
biomarkers  to develop hypotheses for response to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

5.0  Treatment Program  
Treatment Overview  
For a detailed tabular view of the treatment, monitoring, and follow -up schedule, se e the Study 
Calendar (Section 10 ) 
Treatment cycle definition  
Each cycle will consist of [ADDRESS_959146], or the study is 
terminated by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor. 
The study will consis t of two phases – a safety phase and a dose expansion phase:  
 
Safety phase: A standard 3+3 dose finding rule will be employed  with two dose levels .  Patients will start 
at dose level 1  [IRX-2 regimen at dose of 2 mL (230 units/day)] . Patients wi ll be enrolled in cohort s of 3, 
separated by [CONTACT_2669]  1 week.  Initially, 3 patients will be treated with expansion to 3 more patients in 
the event of 1/3 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) as observ ed during the first 3  weeks of treatment, 
escalation if 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs, and termination of escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs.  Once ≥ [ADDRESS_959147] been treated at the dose level. The max imum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined 
as the highest dose tested in which only 0 or 1 out of 6 evaluable patients experience a DLT.  The 
Recommended Phase 2 Dosing (RP2D)  will not exceed the MTD but may be lower based on cumulative 
toxicities and dose modification patterns.  If the rules suggest escalation at the highest proposed dose, 
that dose will accrue to 6 patients where <2 DLTs will determine that as the MTD, and 2 or more DLTs 
will require de -escalation. These rules will be used to determine the IRX -2 regimen dosing for the 
expansion phase .   
 
Dose expansion phase: 8-14 patients will be enrolled at the recommended dos e level from the safety  
phase, for a t otal enroll ment of 20 patients. The 6-12 patients treated in the dose escalation portion of 
the study will be counted as part of the dose expansion patient population.  Two doses of IRX -2 will be 
considered (Table 5 -1). There will be no intra -patient dose escalation; participants will undergo dose 
modification due to toxicity ( Section 6).  
Table 5-1: Dose Levels of IRX-2 
Dose Level  IRX-2 Dose  
Starting 
Dose Level: 
1 230 units (2 mL) total daily  for 10 days : 2 injections daily comprised of 115 units in each 
1 mL injection ; 1 injection  administered into  the left and 1 injection into the right 
supraclavicular  lymph node region s (substitute axillary regions if supraclavicular  nodes 
have been removed )  
2 460 units (4 mL) total daily for 10 days: 4 injections daily comprised of 115 units in each 
1 mL injection; 1 injection each  into both supraclavicular and 1 injection each into both 
axillary lymph node region s (substitute mastoid insertio n if supraclavicular or axillary 
nodes have been removed )  
 
Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity  
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that occurs during the DLT evaluation period of 3 
weeks (between  Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 21) and are considered related to study treatment . Toxicity 
that is clearly and directly related to the p rimary disease or to another etiology is excluded from this 
definition. A patient is evaluable for DLT if he/she receives the cycle 1 dose of pembrolizumab (100%) and 
 
 
23 
 
 80% of the planned doses of IRX -2 during cycle 1 OR he/she experiences a DLT.  If this minimum amount 
of treatment is not reached due to treatment related AEs, this is considered a DLT.  However, patients 
who fail to achieve this minimum amount of treatment due to reasons that are clearly unrelated to 
treatment (e.g. error on part of patient o r healthcare provider ) will be replaced.   The following will be 
DLTs: 
•  Any Grade 4  adverse event deemed to be immune -related 
•  Any ≥Grade 3 colitis  
•  Any Grade 3 or 4 non -infectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration

Agents Administration  
5.1.1  IRX-2 Regimen  
The IRX-2 regimen will be given every 12 weeks starting with Cycle 1.  Cyclophosphamide will be 
administered as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each IRX-2 regimen  at a dose of 300 mg/m2.  
IRX-2 will be administered subcutaneously into  a maximum of  4 lymph node -bearing regions , i.e. the 
bilateral supraclavicular  and axillary regions.  For dose level 1, 1  ml (115 units/ml) will be injected into 
each of the 2 lymph node regions (total 2 ml (230 units/day))  corresponding to the bilateral supraclavicular 
areas only .  If dose level 2 is reached, 1 ml (115 units/ml) will be injected into each of the 4 lymph node 
regions (total 4 ml (460 units/day)).  
IRX-2 Regimen  includes one dose of cyclophosphamide on Day 1  of each designated  cycle, and 
subcutaneous IRX -2 injections in bilateral supraclavicular (and axillary regions  if applicable)  for 10 days 
between Days 4 and 15.  The 10 days are not required to be consecutive  (e.g. dosing not mandatory on 
weekends/holidays) provided dosing is completed by [CONTACT_4475] 15.  
 
5.1.2  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab  will be given at the approved dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks beginning with Day 1 of  
Cycle 1.  
Pembrolizumab  will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 21 days (+/- 3 days). 
Study Procedures  
For a detailed list of all study procedures including timing and windows, s ee the Study Calendar .  
Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Study Treatment  
Patients will receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria 
for removal from study treatment are satisfied. Participants may be removed from treatm ent for any of 
the following reasons:  
•  Evidence of disease progression  
•  Patient is deemed intolerant to study treatment because of toxicity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_58349]/delay.  
•  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
•  Participant  withdraws from the treatment phase of the study  
•  General or specific changes in the participant’s condition, including non -compliance, which 
renders the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_44984].  
Documentat ion of the reason for discontinuing therapy and the date effective should be made in the 
medical record and appropriate eCRF. The participant should then proceed to off -treatment procedures 
for safety monitoring, and follow -up procedures. The participant’s  status is to be modified in the MIDAS 
system once the off -treatment period is completed. Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_959150], contact[CONTACT_519431]/or a review of outside medical records 
(note: this is not an all -inclusive list).  
The schedule and windows for assessments and data collection points are further det ailed in the Study 
Calendar.  
Criteria for Completion of Study Participation  
Participants may be removed from the study as a whole at  any time at their own request, or they may 
be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The 
reasons for discontinuing study participation should be documented and may include:  
•  Participant completes a ll study procedures including all study follow -up procedures.  
•  Participant withdraws consent for follow -up. 
•  Participant is determined to be lost to follow -up. All attempts to contact [CONTACT_705842].  
The reason for study removal and the date  the participant was removed must be documented in the 
source documentation and the study -specific case report form (CRF). The participant’s status is to be 
modified in the MIDAS system once the participant completes the study.  
Supportive Care and Other C oncomitant Therapy  
All concomitant medications taken during the study treatment will be recorded in the Case Report Form. 
The minimum requirements are that drug name [CONTACT_160531]. All 
prescription and over-the-counter medications that have been taken within [ADDRESS_959151] 
dose of investigational treatment should also be reported in the Case Report Form.  
Patients should receive full supportive care during the study, including treatment with a ntibiotics, 
antiemetics, blood transfusions, antidiarrheals, and analgesics as appropriate . 
5.1.3  Included concomitant medications  
Supportive medications:  
Supportive medication/class of drug:  Usage: 
Concomitant medications or treatments 
(e.g., acetaminophen or  diphenhydramine) 
deemed necessary to provide adequate 
prophylactic or supportive care, except for 
those medications identified as “prohibited ”. To be administered as prescribed by [CONTACT_62660] (including antibiotics, 
nutritional support, correction of metabolic 
disorders, optimal symptom control, and pain 
management [including palliative radiotherapy 
to non-target lesions, etc.])  Should be used, when necessary, for all patients  
 
 
 
26 
 
 5.1.4  Excluded concomitant medications  
 Prohibited concomitant medications  
Prohibited medication/class of drug:  Usage: 
Any investigational anticancer therapy other 
than those under investigation in this study  Should not be given concomitantly whilst the patient 
is on study treatment  
mAbs against CTLA -4, PD-1, or PD-L1 other 
than pembrolizumab  Should not be given concomitantly whilst the patient 
is on study treatment  
Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
immunotherapy, or biologic or hormonal 
therapy for cancer treatment other than t hose 
under investigation in this study  Should not be given concomitantly whilst the patient 
is on study treatment. (Concurrent use of hormones 
for non-cancer-related conditions [e.g.,  insulin for 
diabetes and hormone replacement therapy] is 
acceptable. Local treatment of isolated lesions, 
excluding target lesions, for palliative intent is 
acceptable [e.g., by [CONTACT_72971]] ) 
Immunosuppressive medications including, but 
not limited to, systemic corticosteroids at 
doses exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, and 
tumor necrosis factor -α blockers  Should not be given concomitantly, or used for 
premedication prior to the immunotherapy infusions. 
The following are allowed exceptions:  
•  Use of immunosuppr essive medications for 
the management of immune -related AEs,  
•  Short-term premedication for patients 
receiving combination agents where the 
prescribing information for the agent 
requires the use of steroids for documented 
hypersensitivity reactions,   
•  Use in patients with contrast allergies.  
•  In addition, use of inhaled, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], and 
intranasal corticosteroids is permitted.  
  
A temporary period of steroids will be allowed if 
clinically indicated and considered to be essential for 
the management of non -immunotherapy related 
events experienced by [CONTACT_102] (e.g., chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, radiation, nausea, 
etc.).

 6.0  Anticipated Toxicities and Dose Delays/Modifications for Adverse Events  
 
Anticipated Toxicities  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are known to cause autoimmune toxicities including pneumonitis, colitis, 
hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, rash, encephalitis.  
In prior Phase [ADDRESS_959152] common 
adverse even ts (AEs) were headache (30%), injection site pain (22%), nausea (22%), constipation (15%), 
dizziness (15%), fatigue (11%), aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499] (11%), anemia (11%) and myalgia (7%). All were 
grade 1-2 except for the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_705806] (one Grade 3, one Grade 4) and all resolved without 
sequelae. There were only minor (grade 1) alterations in post -treatment laboratory values. Eight serious 
adverse events (SAEs) in [ADDRESS_959153]-operative 
period: aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] p neumonia (n = 3), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], asthma exacerbation, wound infection, 
neck abscess and alcohol withdrawal (n = 1 each); only the postoperative wound infection was 
considered related to the study treatment  (42). During treatment, several subj ects noted decreased pain 
or improved swallowing and no significant progressive symptoms were noted.  
6.1.1  Potential Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_705807]: diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, fever, headache, infusion related 
reaction (injection site reaction), arthralgia, shortness of breath, asthenia  
Pembrolizumab  only: fatigue, itching rash, increased creatinine, increased blood sugar changes, 
low sodium, increased lipase, alterations in thyroid hormones, increased alkaline phosphata se, 
ALT, amylase, and AST, chills, constipation, cough, dizziness, dry mouth, dry skin, inflammation 
of color, or mouth, loss of color pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], lung inflammation, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, 
redness, swelling, vomiting  
IRX-2 only: lymphopenia, anemi a, difficult swallowing, myalgia, rhinorrhea, neutrophilia, 
hypoalbuminemia, dehydration, hypotension, pain With elimination of indomethacin, 
omeprazole, and zinc supplementation, we aim to see fewer toxicities that may be associated 
with indomethacin -induced gastritis.  To still carefully assess overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], dose 
escalation will start with dose level 1 as per Section 5.0.  
 
 
6.1.2  General Information  
The study will use the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.[ADDRESS_959154] permanently discontinue study treatment.  
 
 
28 
 
 6.1.3  Dose Modifications  
Guidelines for the management of immune -mediated reactions for pembrolizumab  are provided in the 
Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines in Appendix I. Patients should be thoroughly 
evaluated and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or 
other etiologic causes of the immune related AE. Serolog ic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as 
appropriate, should be used to support an immune related AE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear 
alternative etiology, events should be considered potentially immune related.  
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which pembrolizumab  should be permanently 
discontinued (see the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines in Appendix I).  
Dose reductions for pembrolizumab  are not permitted . In case of doubt, the local investig ator should 
consult with the study principal inves tigator and Sponsor.  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the immune related AE. Serologic, immunologic, 
and histologic (biopsy) da ta, as appropriate, should be used to support an immune related AE diagnosis. 
In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, events should be considered potentially immune related.  
All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE, Version 5. 
Dose reductions for IRX -2 injections are not permitted . In case of doubt, the local investigator should 
consult with the study principal investigator.  
7.0  Data and Safety Monitoring and Adverse Event Reporting  
7.1.0  Adverse  Events and Unanticipated Problems  
7.1.1  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing condition that occurs 
during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to be related t o the protocol intervention.  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any expected or unexpected adverse event s that result in any of the following 
outcomes:  
•  Death 
•  Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred) 
•  Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
•  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
•  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
•  Secondary m alignancy*  
 
 
29 
 
 •  Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bro nchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias of convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
*Modified from 21 CFR 312.32  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others  
An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three  of the following 
criteria: 
1.  Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied; AND 
2.  Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by [CONTACT_177435], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND 
3.  Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Even ts of Special Interest (AESI)  
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of standard safety 
monitoring activities. These events, regardless of seriousness, will be reported.  
   
 
7.1.2  Assessment of Adverse Events  
The site Investigator will be responsible for determining the event name, assessing the severity (i.e. 
grade), expectedness, and attribution of all adverse events.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Adverse Event Name [CONTACT_705861] v 5.0.  A copy of the scale can be found at NCI/ CTEP w eb site. The determination of severity for 
all other events not listed in the CTCAE v 5.0 should be made by [CONTACT_705843] 1 to 5 as defined below:  
•  Grade 1 (mild) – An event that is usually t ransient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living. 
•  Grade 2 (moderate) – An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
 
 
30 
 
 •  Grade 3 (severe) – An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usua l activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.  
•  Grade 4 (life threatening) – An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an 
imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the 
subject to perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).  
•  Grade 5 (fatal) – Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Attribution  
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study 
agent or study procedure.  
•  Unrelated – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the participant.  
•  Unlikely – The event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concom itant drugs.  
•  Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.   
•  Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, the rapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
•  Definite – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_705844]’s condition, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant drugs, AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, improves 
upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], or reappears on re -exposure.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Expectedness  
The following definiti ons will be used to determine the expectedness of the event:   
•  Unexpected – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure 
and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk 
factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event. *Mod ified from 21 CFR 
312.32 (a)  
•  Expected – An adverse event is expected if it does not meet the criteria for an unexpected 
event, OR is an expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or 
predisposed risk factor of the research participant experiencing the adverse event.   
 
 
 
31 
 
 7.1.3   Reporting of Adverse Events  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Routine Reporting of Non -Serious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_705845]. Recording of adverse events will 
begin once the patient is consented and will continue until [ADDRESS_959155] dose of treatment.  
Adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_705846] (PMT). Adverse events that do not 
meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems do not require expedited reporting.  AEs 
reported through expedited processes (i.e. reported to the IRB, DSMC, FDA, etc.) must also be reported 
in routine study data submissions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expediting Reporting Requirements of SAEs and UPs by [CONTACT_505503]  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Criteria for Reporting SAEs/UPs to the Coordinating Center  
Serious Adverse Events meeting the criteria specified below will be repo rted to the Coordinating Center 
within 24 hours of notification that the event occurred.  
 
Adverse events that require expedited reporting include:  
•  AEs or SAEs that meet the definition of an unanticipated problem  
•  All deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_959156] ive treatment

 Serious Adverse Events meeting the requ irements for expedited reporting to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 , will be reported as an IND safety report using the 
MedWatch Form FDA 3500A for Mandatory Reporting . 
 
The criteria that require reporting using the Medwatch 3500A are:  
•  Any unexpected fatal or life threatening adverse experi ence associated with use of the drug 
must be reported to the FDA no later than 7 calendar days after initial receipt of the 
information [ 21 CFR 312.32(c)(2) ]

 the protocol when necessary so long as such a deviation does not threaten patient safety or protocol 
scientific integrity. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_705848].  
 
7.2.1  Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deviation 
A deviation is a divergence from a specific element of a protocol that occurred without prior IRB 
approval.  Investigators may deviate from the protocol to eliminate immediate hazard(s) for the 
protection, safety, and well -being of the study subjects witho ut prior IRB approval.  
Examples include, but are not limited to: a) dose adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b) 
alteration in treatment schedule due to non -availability of the research participant for treatment; and c) 
laboratory test results w hich are slightly outside the protocol requirements but at levels that do not 
affect participant safety.  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Single Subject Exceptions (SSE)  
An SSE is a planned deviation, meaning that it involves circumstances in which the specific procedures 
called for in a protocol are not in the best interests of a specific patient.  It is a deviation that is 
anticipated and receives prior approval by [CONTACT_941] P I and the IRB.  
  
7.2.2  Reporting of Deviations and SSEs  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Deviations  
For any deviation, the  Investigator  will notify the COH DSMC and IRB within [ADDRESS_959160] of deviations 
from all participating sites will be submitted along with the Protocol Managem ent Team (PMT) progress 
report to the COH DSMC.  
 
For non-COH sites:  
o  The local IRB and/or DSMC must be notified according to local institutional policies.  
o  The study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_705812] (within 24 hours of 
notification of the event) via email to [EMAIL_12766]  and [EMAIL_626] .  This email 
should provide input on the following:  
▪  Description of the event  
▪  Impact on participant safety or the safety to others 
▪  Impact on the study design  
▪  A corrective and preventative action plan  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Single Subject Exceptions  
 
 
[ADDRESS_959161] be submitted as a “Single Subject Exception Amendment Request” via iRIS in accordance  
with IRB guidelines and the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy .  An IRB approved SSE does not 
need to be submitted as a deviation to the DSMC.  
 
All non-emergency planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by [CONTACT_705849], the Site Principal Investigator, COH IRB, and when applicable, the local IRB.  In 
addition, if contractually obligated, the sponsor must al so approve the deviation.  
 
7.3.0  Study Oversight, Quality Assurance, and Data & Safety Monitoring  
7.3.1  All Investigator  Responsibilities

Drug Information for Pembrolizumab  (Keytruda®) 
Other Names:  Keytruda® 
Mode of Action:   Pembrolizumab  is a fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody 
which binds to and blocks the activation of PD -1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein.  This 
prevents the interaction between PD -1 with its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1), 
overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2), which is primary 
expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs).  This results in the activation of T -cells and cell -
mediated immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens.

•  Do not freeze.  
 
Use of IRX-2 and COVID -19 
As the extent of the exposure and infection with COVID -19 grows, Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics (BITX) 
has reviewed the available literature and is providing the following as guidance for use of IRX -[ADDRESS_959167] been linked to cytokin e 
release syndrome, or “Cytokine storm”. It is important to note that during the development of IRX -2, we 
have not had any reports of Cytokine Release Syndrome to date, but, given the components, and 
mechanism of action of the drug, BITX feels there could be a small, but theoretically possible risk in the 
administration of IRX -2 to a patient who may be co -infected with COVID -19, by [CONTACT_705852].  
Given this, we recommend the following:  
•  All subjects should have a neg ative COVID -[ADDRESS_959168] dose of a cycle of IRX -2. 
•  Subjects should be instructed to take all precautions possible to limit their exposure to 
COVID-19 during their treatment with IRX -2. 
•  Any subjects that present  with symptoms of COVID -[ADDRESS_959169], resumption of IRX -2 dosing can occur at the 
Investigator’s discretion.

TGen Downstream Correlative Analyses  
An overall lo w abundance of somatic 
mutations with antigenic potential is a 
second feature of Gastroesophageal cancers 
that may limit its responsiveness to 
immunotherapy . T cell-mediated immunity 
to neo-antigens (novel peptide sequences 
created by [CONTACT_705855]) shapes the 
genomic lan dscape of emergent tumors and 
mediates the efficacy of successful 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]57. However, p redicting 
which tumor mutations have immunogenic 
potential is a multi -factorial and highly -personalized inquiry, 
dependent upon: (i) the set of particular mutant sequences in the 
tumor, (ii) the expression of proteins cont aining those sequences, 
(iii) the ability of mutant sequences to be presented by [CONTACT_705856], and (iv) the activation and expansion of appropriate T 
cells that can eliminate the tumor. We estimate a median ~40 
somatic coding mutations per GE tu mor. Based on published 
estimates, 5 -20% of these might be expected to have antigenic 
potential. As a consequence, even if the tumor microenvironment is 
modulated to become more immunogenic, the potential for a 
clinical response to combination immunotherap y is likely to depend 
upon an intrinsic capacity for T cell recognition that varies from 
tumor to tumor58. 
Both MHC class I -restricted CD8+ and MHC class II -restricted CD4+ T 
cells have been implicated in successful anti -tumor immunity59, 60. 
Athough in silico methods for predicting class I binding sequenc es 
have shown some utility, models of HLA class II binding are generally of limited predictive value60. To 
address this gap, we developed a novel multiplexed  proteomics technology ‘MHC -PepSeq’ that enables 
large (10,000s), programmable sets of DNA -encoded peptides to be assayed for binding against a panel of 
human HLA class II proteins, using a digital sequencing readout. This technology will be deployed in 
association with comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic sequencing ( Figure 1). Importantly, our 
recent validation experiments, indicate this system has proven to be highly effective at predicting the 
Figure 1. An integrated approach to 
predict and monitor neo -antigen-specific 
immunity.  (A) Comprehensive genomic 
tumor analysis (exome, transcriptome 
sequencing, in silico neoantigen prediction) 
will be combined with the MHC -PepSeq 
assay to identify tumor mutations that 
result in variant pep tides capable of binding 
host HLA. The landscape of such mutations 
may be predictive of the response to 
immunotherapy. (B) Non-invasive (ctDNA) 
assays measuring the abundance of 
different classes of the mutations 
characterized in (A) will be developed for 
serial study of each individual and used to 
monitor the response over time. 
Disproportionate changes in the 
abundance of immunogenic v non -
immunogenic mutations may provide a 
sensitive measure of immune pressure in 
response to immunotherapy.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_959174] within the trial, we will assay 
tumor sections for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). While TIL density/localizat ion has previously been 
correlated with therapeutic anti -tumor immunity, it can be challenging to obtain serial samples of tumor 
tissue after treatment and, even when such biopsies are obtained, traditional tissue analysis affords only 
a fairly narrow view  of the response. Therefore, in parallel, we will develop a richer view using an 
integrated comprehensive genomics approach to predict and monitor neo -antigen-specific immunity 
(outlined in Figure 1 ). This approach combines 2 novel multiplexed assays (“MHC -PepSeq” and “TARDIS”) 
that both provide personalized information about the immunogenicity of mutations within individual 
tumors. 
(i) MHC-PepSeq – identifying mutations with 
immunogenic potential  
We will use a new multiplexed assay (MHC -
PepSeq), together with  in silico prediction, to assay 
all tumor mutations expressed in each individual 
(identified by [CONTACT_705857]) 
against autologous HLA II proteins. Each mutation 
will be represented, alongside its wild -type 
counterpart, at each position of a 15mer pepti de - 
resulting in ~30 peptides per SNV/indel.  
 
For each patient, the assay will output a personalized 
immunogenicity landscape  that represents the predicted 
interaction between tumor and host. We expect ~5 -20% 
of the coding somatic mutations to have immun ogenic 
potential restricted by [CONTACT_705858]’s HLAs, 
resulting in a fairly limited and variable set of potential 
neo-antigens in each patient. We will assess whether 
these neo -antigen sets are predictive of the clinical 
response to combinatio n therapy across the trial cohort.  
(ii) ctDNA-based monitoring tumor response to combination immunotherapy  
We have developed a targeted multiplexed digital sequencing assay for circulating tumor DNA (‘TARDIS’) 
that enables non -invasive high -dimensional tum or monitoring by [CONTACT_234216] a panel of personalized 
tumor variant sequences in circulating cell -free DNA. Changes in the allele fraction of these variants over 
time are indicative of changes in tumor activity, load and/or composition – and have been shown  to 
provide early indicators of the response to therapy61,62. Here, we propose to extend this concept to the 
detection of immune -mediated selection. Using the immunogenicity -predicting assay described above, 
we will identify 2 categories of mutations for each individual’s tumor  – putatively ‘ immunogenic’ and 
‘non-immunogenic’ . For each category/patient, a multiplexed panel of ~[ADDRESS_959175] proteins, 
resulting in ~[ZIP_CODE] multiplexed peptide -MHC measurements. 
The subset (~1%) o f data corresponding to HLA -DRB1*01:01

compensate for any limitations in the immun ogenicity prediction step. Overall, this strategy will offer a 
sensitive molecular correlate of anti -tumor immunity that will be viewed alongside – and used to enrich 
– the interpretation of  standard clinical monitoring (i.e. imaging).

 11.0  Evaluation Criteria/Measurement of Effect  
Primary Endpoint: Toxicity   
The primary endpoint is toxicity. Toxicity will be captured in a standardized manner using the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (v 5). Dose limiting toxicity is defined in Section 5.4 of the 
protocol. The MTD will be based on the assessment of DLT . All patients who are not evaluable for dose 
limiting toxicity will be replaced.   A patient is evaluable for DLT if he/she receives the cycle 1 dose of 
pembrolizumab (100%) and 80% of the planned doses of IRX -2 during cycle 1 OR he/she experiences a 
DLT.  If this minimum amount of treatment is not reached due to treatment related AEs,  this is 
considered a DLT.  However, patients who fail to achieve this minimum amount of treatment due to 
reasons that are clearly unrelated to treatment (e.g. error on part of patient or healthcare provider ) will 
be replaced.  
Secondary Endpoint: Response  
Response is the secondary  endpoint. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the 
new updated international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] 
(RECIST) Committee version 1.1.  
Only those patients who h ave measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These 
patients will have their response classified according to the definitions sta ted below.  (Note:  Patients 
who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
11.1.1  Definitions  
•  Evaluable for toxicity :  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment 
with IRX-2 and/or pembrolizumab . 
•  Evaluable for objective response :  Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified according to 
the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the 
end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
11.1.2  Disease Param eters 
•  Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >10mm with conventional techniques (CT, 
MRI, or caliper measurement) and as >20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776].) Lymph nodes greater than 10mm on short axis are considered measureable as well. 
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
•  Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <[ADDRESS_959184] X -ray or <[ADDRESS_959185], MRI or caliper measurement), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Organomegaly, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericard ial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_705859] -measurable.  
•  Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Lymph nodes less than 15mm in the short axis cannot be used as target 
 
 
52 
 
 lesions.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesio ns with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_15078]).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum LD.  The bas eline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_44934].  
•  Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and 
above the [ADDRESS_959186] of a treatment.  
•  Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., 
skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a  ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
•  Chest x-ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
•  Conventional CT and MRI :  These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_959187], abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors an d 
those of extremities usually require specific protocols.  
•  Ultrasound (US) :  When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, US 
should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical 
measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.  US 
might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed 
by [CONTACT_12148].  
•  Endoscopy, Laparoscopy :  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation has not 
yet been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated 
equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers.  Therefore, the 
utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation 
purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
•  Tumor markers :  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  
•  Cytology, Histology :  These techniques can be used to diffe rentiate between partial responses (PR) 
and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 
53 
 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any  effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect 
of the trea tment) and progressiv e disease. 
Response Criteria  
11.1.4  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Lymph node CR is when the 
lymph node has decreased to less than 10mm in the short axis.  
Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started (including the baseline scan if that is the 
smallest), and at least a 5mm increase or the appearance of new 
lesions. 
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking a s reference the smallest sum 
LD since the treatment started  
11.1.5  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  
Incomplete 
Response/Stable Disease 
(SD): Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. However, unequi vocal 
progression should not normally trump target disease status.  It 
must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999].  
11.1.[ADDRESS_959188] response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response a ssignment will 
depend on the achievement of measurement criteria, but confirmation is not necessary.

SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No PD

Any Any Yes PD 
* In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions 
may be accepted as disease progression.  
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression 
at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration” .  Every effort 
should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  
11.1.7  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the  first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement crite ria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started.  
11.1.8  Disease Control Rate (DCR)  
DCR is defined as the proportion of pa tients with the best overall response of CR, PR, or SD 
according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_959189] (irRECIST)  
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_959190] (irRECIST) is RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_959191] 1.1 may continue treatment if clin ically 
stable as per  Table 11.  If the repeat scan confirms PD, patients will be discontinued from 
treatment.  Exception can be made if the Investigator feels the patient is deriving benefit from 
treatment and after discussion with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_80336] .  Subsequent imaging should be 
pursued every 6 weeks until demonstration of confirmed PR or CR in which event imaging will 
then be conducted every 9 weeks if a patients has  completed initial 18 weeks of protocol therapy .  
Imaging may be more frequent if c linically indicated.  
 
Clinically stable is defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
•  Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression  
•  No decline in ECOG performance status  
•  Absence of rapid progression of disease  
•  Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention

Protocol Deviations  
12.1.4  Deviation Polic y 
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “Clinical Research Protocol Deviation Policy”  
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter the protocol integrity 
require prior IRB approval of a single subject ex ception (SSE) request. IRB pre -approved SSE protocol 
modifications are considered an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation. The submission of a 
deviation report is not required.  
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to tr avel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, family responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc. This can a lso 
extend to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_705816]. Example include, but are not limited to: dose 
adjustments  based on excessive patient weight, alteration in treatment  schedule due to non -availability 
of the research participant for treatment, laboratory test results which are slightly outside the protocol 
requirements but at levels that do not affect participant safety. These instances are considered 
deviations from th e protocol. A deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRM within five days.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_959194] the report to 
the IRM following review.  
12.1.6  Resolving Disputes  
The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research agent that would cause a protocol 
deviation without approval by [CONTACT_978]. Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key point, the IDS 
should rely on the PI [INVESTIGATOR_177380].  
In situations where there is misperception or dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the persons 
involved in implementing the protocol it is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_705817].  
13.[ADDRESS_959195] igation will comprise a s afety lead-in phase: A standard 3+3 dose finding rule will be 
employed  with two dose levels .  Patients will start at dose level 1  [IRX-2 regimen at dose of 2 mL (230 
units/day)] . Patients will be enrolled in cohort s of 3, separated  by [CONTACT_2669]  1 week.  Initially, 3 patients 
will be treated with expansion to 3 more patients in the event of 1/3 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) as 
observed during the first 3  weeks of treatment, escalation if 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs, and termination of 
escalation if ≥ 2 DLTs.  Once ≥ [ADDRESS_959196] been treated at the dose 
level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose tested in which only 0 or 1 out 
of 6 evaluable patients experience a DLT.  The Recommended Phase 2 Dosing (RP2D)  will not exceed the 
MTD but may be lower based on cumulative toxicities and dose modification patterns.  If the rules 
suggest escalation at the highest proposed dose, that dose will accrue to 6 patients where <2 DLTs will 
determine that as the MTD, and 2 or more DLTs will require de -escalation. These rules will be used to 
determine the IRX -2 regimen dosing for the expan sion phase . Occurrence and severity of adverse events

Research Institute (Scottsdale, AZ) .  
Confidentiality  
This research will be conducted in compliance with federal and st ate of [LOCATION_004] requirements relating 
to protected health information (PHI).  The study will record individual response to the study drugs and 
any side effects, and this will be linked to the subject’s identity using a coded study number.  The 
principal investigator, co -investigators, and laboratory technicians will have access to this information, 
but all information will  be treated confidentially.  No identifiers will be used in any subsequent 
publication of these results.  
Financial Obligations and Compensation  
The investigational drug, IRX -[ADDRESS_959203] of care drug(s) , pembrolizumab  and standard of care procedures provided will be the 
responsibi lity of the research participant and/or insurance carrier. The research participant will be 
responsible for all copayments, deductibles, and other costs of treatment and diagnostic procedures as 
set forth by [CONTACT_91642]. The research participant and/or the insurance carrier will be billed for 
the costs of treatment and diagnostic procedures in the same way as if the research participant were 
not in a research study. However, neither the research participant nor the insurance carrier will be 
responsible for the research procedures related to this study.  
In the event of physical injury to a research participant, resulting from research procedures, appropriate 
medical treatment will be available at each participating institution in the injured resear ch participant; 
however, financial compensation will not be available.

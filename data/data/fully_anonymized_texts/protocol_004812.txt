Page 5 of 24 Objective  
This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 1940 nm diode fractional 
laser handpi[INVESTIGATOR_80437]. In addition to 
demonstrating skin resurfacing, a secondary goal of this study is to generate data with the 
1940 nm diode fractional laser handpi[INVESTIGATOR_80438] a regulatory submission for t reatment 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436], such as, but not limited to lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sun 
spots), and ephelides (freckles).  
Background and Rationale  
The use of lasers to selectively target chromophores in the skin was first described by 
[CONTACT_80469] 1983.[ADDRESS_87804] been developed with 
wavelengths in the near to mid -infrared spectrum that are selectively absorbed by [CONTACT_80470] a nonablative 
manner to coagulate structure s of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_80439].  Initially these nonablative lasers were used with a flat beam profile for skin 
resurfacing2.  Starting in 2004, these technologies were followed by [CONTACT_80471] l lasers that deliver the energy to the skin as arrays of microscopic 
treatment zones (MTZs) for indications ranging from skin resurfacing, to treatment of 
wrinkles and fine lines, pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436], scars, and other dermatological 
indications.3,4,5,6,7,[ADDRESS_87805] skin re surfacing will be enrolled at up to three 
(3) investigational sites.   After meeting all inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the 
exclusion criteria as well as providing signed informed consent, a subject will be considered 
enrolled in the study, and assigned a unique study identification number.  
 
Subjects will initially receive up to four (4) test spots on their face and up to four (4) test 
spots on other anatomical locations (e.g., hands, arm, back, chest) using the FRAX [ADDRESS_87806] spot area will typi[INVESTIGATOR_80440] 2 inches by 2 
inches (5 cm  X 5 cm).     
 
Subjects will be scheduled for a follow -up visit at 4 ± 2 days and 14 ± 7 days (Follow -Up 
Visit #1) after the test spots.  Based on the observed skin responses and healing seen at 
Follow -Up Visit #1, the Investigator or study staff will determine if a subj ect is an 
appropriate candidate to proceed with the skin resurfacing treatment on the face which will 
be administered either at this same visit, or scheduled at a future time point during a [ADDRESS_87807] spots.  Addit ional skin resurfacing treatment 
FRX19004 Revision 2.0 30 Aug 2019  
Page 6 of 24 may be also administered in other locations that contain  pi[INVESTIGATOR_80441], 
hands, arms, legs, back, and/or chest.  
 
If it is determined by [CONTACT_80472] 14 ± [ADDRESS_87808] intake 
through final follow -up is shown in Figure 1.  
 
Figure 1:  Study Flow Chart  
 
 
After receiving skin resurfacing Treatment #1, subjects will be scheduled for a follow -up 
visits for clinical evaluation and photography at 7 ± 3 days.  Tr eatment #2 will be scheduled 
4 ± 1 weeks after Treatment #1 if skin assessment is acceptable; and Treatment #3 will be 
scheduled 4 ± 1 weeks after Treatment #2.  Additional interim follow -up visits may be 
required between treatment visits at the discretion  of the Investigator or study staff if 
required to monitor the treated area(s), and possibly 2 and/or 3 months after final treatment 
if lingering adverse events need to be monitored to resolution.  
 
A follow -up visit will be scheduled approximately 4 ± 1 w eeks (1 month) after the final 
treatment, typi[INVESTIGATOR_80442] #3.   
 
A final follow -up visit will be scheduled approximately 12 ± 1 weeks (3 months) after the 
final treatment, typi[INVESTIGATOR_80442] #3.  Note:  Fewer than three treatments may be 
required at t he discretion of the Investigator or study staff.

This study will begin enrollment of subjects at each investigational site only after receiving 
written approval from the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) or other regulatory 
authorities deemed necessary depending on specific country or local requirements.   
Study Visits  
Subject Enrollment  
Once a qualifying subject is enrolled into the study, their visits will be scheduled as 
illustrated in the S tudy Flow Chart (Figure 1) and study activities as described below.   
 
Screening and Baseline Visits  
Subjects will be evaluated against the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the Screening Visit 
for eligibility to participate in the study.  
 
Eligible subject will be scheduled for a baseline visit during which they will be asked to read 
and sign the Informed Consent Form, receive a unique study identification number, and 
receive their baseline photography.  The baseline visit may occur on the s ame visit as 
screening.  
 
Enrolled subjects may also receive the study test spots during the same combined 
screening and baseline visit.  The total duration of a combined screening and baseline visit 
with test spots is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_87818] digital camera.  Flash photography is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_80454].  
As the treatment areas may be directly on or near the face, photography may c ontain 
identifying features.   However, efforts will be made to de -identify images if used for 
scientific/research or promotional purposes.  
 
All subjects must agree to have photography performed and released for research 
purposes since the photographs are used to assess the primary endpoint of the study.  
Additionally, subjects will be asked if their photographs can be released for commercial 
marketing purposes.  
Subject Enrollment  
Once a qualifying subject is enrolled into the study, their visits will be sc heduled as 
illustrated in the Subject Intake Flow Chart (Figure 1) and study activities as described 
below.   
Test Spot and Skin Resurfacing Treatment Procedures  
FRX19004 Revision 2.0 30 Aug 2019  
Page 13 of 24 Prior to receiving skin resurfacing treatments subjects will receive up to four (4) test spots  
at the Test Spot Visit.  The Investigator or study staff will deliver FRAX 1940 laser energy in 
or near the intended treatment area(s) as test spots to evaluate the reaction of the skin.  
This helps the Investigator or study staff determine that the laser  is set to a safe setting, or 
whether more or less energy should be used to achieve clinical endpoint, typi[INVESTIGATOR_80455].   
Each test spot area size will typi[INVESTIGATOR_80456] 2 inches X 2 inches (50 mm 
X 50 mm) and will be tr eated beginning with low energy and low coverage settings.  One or 
both of these settings may be increased as needed in order to achieve a desired clinical 
endpoint.  
 
Before receiving test spots or skin resurfacing treatment, the areas of the skin intended to 
be exposed to the laser energy may need to be shaved to avoid any influence of hairs 
absorbing the treatment laser energy.  
 
Some subjects may be offered anesthesia to minimize discomfort during treatment in the 
form of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_80457] g lidocaine/prilocaine (EMLA), 
benzocaine/lidocaine/tetracaine (BLT), or similar product that would be applied [ADDRESS_87819] treatment parameters are also guided by 
[CONTACT_80475] (FST), location on the body, or other factors.  
Subje cts with presence of benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_80458], arms, chest, back, or legs.  Off -face treatment areas will be limited 
in size per the Investigator or study staff decision depending on factors including bu t not 
limited to practical treatment times, amount of topi[INVESTIGATOR_80459], expected 
duration of anesthesia effect.  
 
If an appropriate clinical response is seen from the test spots at 14 ± [ADDRESS_87820] spots 
(Follow -Up #2), then subjects will b e scheduled to receive up to three (3) skin resurfacing 
treatments.  All subjects will receive resurfacing treatment performed on the face.  
 
FRX19004 Revision 2.[ADDRESS_87821], or legs may also receive up to three (3) 
treatments in these areas.  
 
The skin resurfacing treatment(s) may occur during the same visit as the test spot Follow -
Up #[ADDRESS_87822] 
may be scheduled for a subsequent follow -up visit after another 14 ± 7 days for re -
evaluation (a total of 28 ± [ADDRESS_87823] spots).   S ubjects who are still not 
exhibiting good candidacy for full face treatment at this subsequent visit will be exited from 
the study.  
Facial skin resurfacing treatment will be avoided very close to the eyes, or directly on the 
lips.  Total treatment times wi ll be noted on the appropriate CRF.  
Following each test spot and each skin resurfacing treatment, the study subjects will be 
asked to rate the amount of pain they may have experienced during their test spots or 
treatment on an 11 -point pain scale (0=No Pai n to 10=Extreme Pain) which will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF) by [CONTACT_80476].  A 
sample of the Subject Reported Numerical Pain Scale to be used is provided in Appendix 
A. 
Following all test spots and each treatm ent, the treated area will be examined and 
photographed, and immediate skin responses (Adverse Events) will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF.  
 
Appropriate post -treatment care instructions will be provided as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_80477].   
 
Suggested treatment parameter ranges are provided in Table 4.

Subjects will be scheduled to return for a follow -up visit 4 ± 2 days (Follow Up #1) after 
receiving their test spots in order to evaluate the skin response and have photography 
performed of the test spot areas.  It is anticipated that test spot areas will exhibit the 
formation of MEND s at this visit.  
 
FRX19004 Revision 2.0 30 Aug 2019  
Page 15 of 24 Subjects will also be scheduled to return for a follow -up visit 14 ± 7 days (Follow Up #2) 
after receiving their test spots in order to evaluate the skin response and have photography 
performed of the test spot areas.  It is anticipated t hat any MENDs observed at the prior 
visit will have begun to show resolution or disappearance at this visit, indicating healing and 
resurfacing of the skin.  If an appropriate clinical response is seen from the test spots at this 
visit, then subjects may p roceed to receive up to three (3) skin resurfacing treatments on 
the face.  
 
Subjects not showing adequate healing or adverse events at Follow Up #2 may be 
scheduled to return for a subsequent follow -up visit after an additional 14 ± 7 days (a total 
of 28 ±  [ADDRESS_87825] spots).  After again evaluating the skin response and having 
photography performed of the test spot areas, the Investigator or study staff at this time 
point may decide that a subject exit the study.  
     
Follow -up Visits: Treatm ents  
 
Subjects will be scheduled to return for a follow -up visit 7 ± 3 days after each skin 
resurfacing treatment in order to evaluate the skin response and perform photography of 
the treated area(s).  
 
Treated areas will also be evaluated just before rec eiving Treatment #2 and Treatment #3.  
 
Follow -up visit will be scheduled approximately 4 ± 1 weeks (1 month) and 12 ± 1 weeks (3 
months) after the final treatment, typi[INVESTIGATOR_80442] #3.  NOTE: Fewer than three 
treatments may be administered at the discre tion of the Investigator or study staff due to 
adverse events or complete clearance of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_80461](s).  
Study Endpoints  
 
Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the skin resurfacing treatment will be based on the 
formation of MENDs and the skin’s healing response as measured in days.   
 
Following test spots digital photography and clinical evaluation will be performed at a 
minimum  approximately [ADDRESS_87826] spots (Test Spot Follow -up Visits #1 and 
#2). 
 
Following skin resurfacing treatments digital photography and clinical evaluation will be 
performed at a minimum approximately [ADDRESS_87827] rep orted pain during treatment as scored on an 11 -point scale (0=None, 10= 
Extreme) will be recorded after Test Spots and each Treatment . (Appendix A)  
2. Subject assessment of improvement using a 5 -point Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale 
(GAIS) at each follow -up visit. (Appendix B)  
3. Subject satisfaction with treatment results will be characterized using a 5 -point scale (1 = 
Not Satisfied to 5 = Very Satisfied) at each follow -up period.  (Appendix C)  
4. Improvement in the clearance of  pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436] (if treated)  as determined by [CONTACT_14774] (3)

Risks and Benefits  
Potential Risks  
The study treatments to be administered in this trial carry risks of skin reactions that are 
anticipated or in some cases desired endpoints.  These skin responses are typi[INVESTIGATOR_80462], and transient in nature, resolving within a few days  to a few weeks after 
treatment, and localized to the treated area(s).  Examples include edema, erythema, 
blanching, sloughing, and bronzing (transient darkening).   
 
An additional special type anticipated local skin response unique to nonablative fraction al 
laser treatment is the formation of micro epi[INVESTIGATOR_80435] (MENDs) which appear 
as patterns of small brown dots on the skin surface about the size of the MTZ diameter.  
These are not only common but represent a desired clinical endpoint.  MENDs  typi[INVESTIGATOR_80463] [ADDRESS_87828] a few 
weeks.  
 
Examples of less common but potentially more severe or lingering adverse events may 
include blistering, burning, scarring, herpes simplex virus (HSV) a ctivation, acne eruptions, 
telangiectasia formation, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_80464] -
inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (PIH) that persist beyond one month.  
 
FRX19004 Revision 2.[ADDRESS_87829] spots.  However, 
subjects treated for skin resurfacing may experience improvement in the appearance of fine 
lines, wrinkles, or general tone, texture or appearance of the skin; or clearance of  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_80461] s (if included).   
Adverse Events  
To evaluate safety of the FRAX1940 laser treatments, all adverse events, whether 
expected or less common, will be recorded and scored (see Tables 4 and 5) throughout the 
duration of the study.  Skin assessments will be per formed at baseline, immediately before 
and after each treatment, and at each follow ‐up visit.  All Adverse Events (AE) that occur in 
the study will be documented on the appropriate CRF.   
 
Anticipated adverse events as a result of laser treatment include: edema, erythema, 
blanching, MENDs, sloughing, and bronzing (transient darkening).  Less common adverse 
events include:  blistering, burning, scarring, herpes simplex virus (HSV) activation, acne 
eruptions, telangiectasia formation, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_80465]-inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (PIH).  
 
All local skin responses and adverse events (AE) will be documented as required on the 
appropriate case report form.  The severity of AE will be scored using a numerical scale 
from 0 (no ne) to 4 (severe) as shown in Table 5.  The relatedness of AE to study treatment 
will be scored using the relatedness scale as shown in Table 6 from 0 (unrelated) to 3 
(related), including a choice of U (unable to determine if related).  
 
Any Unanticipated  Adverse Device Effect (UADE) occurring during this study will be 
reported as soon as possible to the sponsor and IRB, but no later than [ADDRESS_87830] learns of the event as outlined in 21 CFR part 812.150(a)(1). 
However, the  Sponsor requests that all Investigators notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_87831], problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the application; or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of sub jects.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that:  
a) led to death,  
b) resulted in life -threatening illness or injury  
c) resulted in permanent impairment of a body structure or body function  
d) resulted in int hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
e) resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to 
body structure or body function, or  
f) led to fetal distress, fetal death, congenital abnormality or birth defect

Investigational Sites  
Up to three (3) Investigational Sites may be included in this study after signed Clinical Trial 
Agreements are in place with the Sponsor, and IRB approval for the study has been 
received.  
 
Investigational sites for this study will be identified by [CONTACT_80478] -qualified for 
participation prior to enrolling subjects in this study.  In -service training on all devices will be 
provided to delegated study personnel at each site prior to or at the time of study initiation.  
Study Monitoring  
It will be the responsibility of the Sponsor to develop and execute an adequate Monitoring 
Plan for this study.   Qualified personnel will be identified by [CONTACT_80479].  It is anticipated that three (3) monitoring visits per site should be 
adequate to ensure site compliance for this study, though additional visits may be 
scheduled at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
Protocol Deviation Reporting  
Subjects enroll ed without meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, enrolled without providing 
informed consent and all other deviations from the protocol should be reported immediately 
to the Sponsor.  The Investigator, Study Monitor, or study staff are responsible for 
deviations to the Sponsor.  Each protocol deviation will be investigated by [CONTACT_1034].  
Record Maintenance  
All completed case report forms including the Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire will be 
sent by [CONTACT_80480] n of the study.   
The Investigator will retain a copy of all study records in accordance with applicable 
regulations for a period of two (2) years following completion or discontinuation of the 
FRX19004 Revision 2.0 30 Aug 2019

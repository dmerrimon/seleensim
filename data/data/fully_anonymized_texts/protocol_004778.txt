Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
Patients who undergo general anesthesia for surgical procedures frequently need to have 
a breathing tube placed (“tracheal intubation”) for the duration of the procedure. Most 
often airway management is routine for an experienced anesthesiologist. Less often, 
airway management can be difficult and can result in patient harm. In order to reduce 
risk, anesthesiologists routinely evaluate patients’ airways by [CONTACT_19201] a relevant h istory 
and doing a physical exam, which can aid in predicting which airways may be difficult to 
manage. The “gold standard” for management of the anticipated difficult airway is to 
perform an awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation after anesthetizing the airway with 
local anesthesia. This affords added safety because the airway remains patent and the 
patient breaths spontaneously until a tracheal tube is secured, at which point general 
anesthesia can be induced.  
 
Recently, authors have advocated for alter native methods of management of the predicted 
difficult airway, most commonly by [CONTACT_2329] a video laryngoscope to perform the awake 
intubation. A video laryngoscope provides an indirect view of the larynx using a camera 
at the tip of a rigid laryngoscope. It takes less training to gain and maintain proficiency 
compared to flexible bronchoscopy.  
 
Previous studies that have shown successful awake intubation with video laryngoscopy in 
the predicted difficult airway have not included patients with head and neck p athology, 
including malignancies or a history of head and neck surgery or radiation. Video

Revised  9/2/14  laryngoscopy may be more prone to failure in this patient population, and randomizing 
this population to video laryngoscopy would pose too great a risk.  
 
If results  of previous studies are erroneously  generalized, anesthesiologists’ skills in 
flexible bronchoscopy will decline. We therefore propose to perform video laryngoscopy 
in patients with head and neck pathology who require awake bronchoscopic intubation 
for su rgery after placement of the tracheal tube and induction of anesthesia. This will 
allow us to approximate what the laryngeal view would have been with video 
laryngoscopy. If there is a significant incidence of difficult video laryngoscopy in this 
patient p opulation, it will reinforce that anesthesiologists need to continue to learn and 
maintain skills in bronchoscopic intubation.  
 
Objectives:  
Research Question:  In patients with predicted difficult airways due to head and 
neck pathology  (malignancy or a hist ory of surgery or radiation therapy)  who 
undergo awake bronchoscopic intubation, what proportion would have been 
possible to intubate with video laryngoscopy?  
Hypothesis: A significant proportion of patients with head and neck 
pathology will have poor laryngeal views with post -induction video 
laryngoscopy by [CONTACT_172753].  
Primary objective: Determine the incidence of difficult (Cormack -Lehane 
grade >2) video laryngoscopic view of the larynx after awake flexible 
bronchoscopic intubation in patien ts with head and neck pathology  
 Secondary objectives:  
a) grade the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtained by [CONTACT_172754]  
b) grade the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtained by v ideo laryngoscopy 
after awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation in patients with head 
and neck masses  
c) grade the view (Cormack -Lehane) obtained by [CONTACT_172755] a history 
of neck radiation

secretions,  view of the tracheal tube during intubation of the larynx (as op posed to blind 
“railroading” of the tube over the bronchoscope) , lower cost , and easier maintenance  of 
equipment . Disadvantages of videolaryngoscopy include possible increased risk of failure 
due to gag reflex unable to be attenuated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_172746] a, inability to use with  
very limited mouth opening, and inability to move around fixed lesions. While video 
laryngoscopy has a well -established role in management of the difficult airway, it does 
have recognized limitations and failures. There appears to be an increased risk of failure 
of video laryngoscopy in patients with airway masses, neck pathology, and neck 
radiation5 plausibly because a flexible scope would be required to move around immobile 
tissues. Neither  direct nor indirect video laryngoscopy can accomplish this necessary 
flexibility. Randomizing this patient population, for whom awake flexible bronchoscopic 
intubation is the gold standard, to ot her techniques would be unsafe, as multiple 
laryngoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] c an increase the difficulty of airway management. As these patients have 
been excluded from previous randomized studies, the results of these studies cannot be 
generalized to the head and neck pathology patient population. This study aims to assess 
the util ity of video laryngoscopy in this patient population by [CONTACT_746] a video 
laryngoscopy after the endotracheal tube is safely secured by [CONTACT_172756]. While laryngoscopy conditions are not identical after an 
endotracheal tube is already in place and the patient is anesthetized, it is the most 
appropriate study design to ensure safety in this patient population.  
 
If we find a signific ant number of difficult video laryngoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_172747], it will reinforce the need for anesthesiologists to maintain skills in flexible 
bronchoscopic intubation. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_172748] a good safety and success 
profile, expe rienced anesthesiologists may incorrectly forego awake bronchoscopic 
intubation. Qualitative analysis of cases in the [LOCATION_008]’s Royal College of 
Anaesthetists’ 4th National Audit Project (NAP4) revealed elements of poor airway 
management in >75% of reports. Upper airway malignancy or disease processes of the 
head and neck were present in 40% of cases presented to NAP4. The report found

j) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects will be immediately withdrawn from the study if:  
• Any difficulty resulting in airway injury occurs during the initial 
awake bronchoscopic intubation  
• The awake broncho scopic intubation is not able to be performed 
successfully  
If withdrawn from the study, the anesthesiologist will not perform the 
planned laryngoscopy with the video laryngoscope.  
 
5) Risks to Subjects  
It is reasonably foreseeable that participants will have  an increased risk of 
sore throat from the addition of video laryngoscopy.  
Video laryngoscopy has the pot ential cause damage to oropharyn geal 
structures, including but not limited to : dentition, hard palate, soft palate, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050], vocal cords, larynx, a nd soft tissue. These injuries are more 
likely to occur when struggling to obtain an adequate view of the larynx in 
order to intubate , which will not be the case for this study . Since the 
airway will be protected with an endotracheal tube during laryngosco py, 
damage/ bleeding in the airway should not lead to issues with oxygenation 
or ventilation.  
There is a risk of hemodynamic changes during laryngoscopy. The 
anesthesiologist will have the ability to treat tachycardia, bradycardia, 
hypertension, and hypot ension with the appropriate pharmacologic agents.

Revised  9/2/[ADDRESS_202236] should be able to reintubate the 
patient using either the flexible bronchoscope or video la ryngoscope, but it 
is possible that reintubation would  be difficult.  
There is a slight risk of having to keep the patient intubated 
postoperatively due to continued bleeding or swelling from damage during 
video laryngoscopy. If this is to occur, the patien t will be admitted to an 
acute care setting for further ventilation management and eventual 
extubation.  
6) Provisions for Research Related Injury  
Subjects  will be monitored during surgery and during recovery from 
anesthesia. Upon discharge, subjects will be provided with a phone 
number to call should they have any concerns related to surgery, 
anesthesia, or the study. If necessary, subjects will be instructed to return 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172751], 
or to the neares t emergency department for any signs of airway 
compromise.  
Subjects  who are injured as a result of this study will be treated until the 
resolution of the adverse event and the cost billed to them and/or their 
insurance carrier. Patients will not be compens ated for research related 
injury , with the exception of damage to dentition that occurs during the 
course of anesthetic care, which is routinely covered by [CONTACT_172762].  
Anesthesiologists and intensive care unit staff will be available to maintain 
ventilation and airway management in the event of airway damage/ 
bleeding requiring prolonged intubation. ENT surgeons will be present in 
the operating room and immediately available in the unlikely case of need 
for an emergent surgical airway.  ENT surgeons would also be available 
for evaluation and treatment of non -emergent oropharyngeal injuries.

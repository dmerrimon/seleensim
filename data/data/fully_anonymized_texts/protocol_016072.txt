 2)  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Title:  Alirocumab in Patients with  Acute Myocardial Infarction  
 
Population:  20 patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_669787] elevation myocardial infarction  
(NSTEMI) who are already taking at least moderate intensity 
statin therapy at time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516827] :   Phase I V clinical trial of the alirocumab , an inhibitor of the 
propro tein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK9),  or placebo 
added to high -intensity statin (atorvastatin 80 mg) in LDL  
cholesterol  lowering during NSTEMI.  
     
Objectives:  To determine the  effectiveness of alirocumab in further 
lowering cholesterol LDL and inflammatory biomarkers when 
initiated acutely in  patients with NSTEMI, in  addition to high 
intensity statin,  atorvastatin 80 mg . 
 
Primary Endpoint:  Placebo -corrected percentage change in calculated LDL 
cholesterol from baseline to day 14. 
 
Secondary Endpoints:  Placebo -corrected percentage change in calculated LDL 
cholesterol from baseline to 72 hours; placebo -corrected 
percentage change in PCSK9 levels from baseline to 72 hours 
and 14 days; placebo -corrected percentage change in 
lipopro tein(a) levels from baseline to 72 hours and 14 days; 
placebo -corrected percentage change in inflammatory 
markers (high -sensitivity CRP, IL -6, IL-10, and TNF -α) from 
baseline to 72 hours and 14 days; and safety and tolerability 
of alirocumab when initiated  in the inpatient setting soon after 
an NSTEMI.  
 
Study Design:  Randomized, double -blinded, placebo -control led phase IV  
clinical trial of a single dose of Alirocumab 150  mg or matched 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be assessed at  enrollment,  
72 hours and 14 days after treatment.

 3) BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity 
across the nation and worldwide.  While major advances in reperfusion strategi es over 
the past several decades have significantly reduced early mortality rates after AMI, 
patients who survive the index event are increasingly at risk for adverse cardiac 
remodeling and the sequelae of heart failure and sudden cardiac death1.  The agin g 
population accelerates this problem, making heart failure a major public health concern. 
Heart failure, indeed, currently affects approximately five million Americans with 
increasing rates of prevalence and incidence.  
 
Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents , and neurohormonal blockers have become standard 
of care in the treatment of patients with AMI, given their established effects on mortality. 
Cholesterol -lowering drugs, primarily HMG -coA reductase inhibitors – statins – have been 
studied as a means not o nly to reduce LDL cholesterol (and hence the incidence of a first 
or recurrent AMI) but also as an adjunct to acute AMI therapy. In the MIRACL trial, 
atorvastatin 80mg was administered within 24 to 96 hours after presentation with acute 
coronary syndrome ( ACS).  When compared to placebo, the atorvastatin group had a 
reduction in the primary endpoint (composite of death, nonfatal AMI, cardiac arrest with 
resuscitation, or recurrent symptomatic myocardial infarction) from 17.4% to 14.8% 
(relative risk = 0.84 [0.70 – 1.00], p=0.048)2. 
 
The ARMYDA trial showed that loading with high dose statins for 7 days prior to elective 
percutaneous intervention (PCI) significantly reduced periprocedural myocardial 
infarction (MI) rates from 18% to 5% (p=0.025)3. This was followed by [CONTACT_516842] -ACS 
trial, showing that initiation of high dose statin therapy in patients presenting with non -ST 
elevation ACS sent to early (<48 hours) angiography reduced the composite primary 
endpoint of  death, MI, or target vessel revascularization from 17% to 5% compared to 
placebo (p=0.010) at 30 days4. 
 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/k exin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are emerging as a promising 
new treatment strategy for LDL cholesterol lowering, demonstrating potent LDL lowering 
effects in addition to or compared to statins, in stable patients in primary or secondary 
prevention 5–9.  PCSK9 is predominantly produced in the liver, intestine, and kidney, 
where it is secreted into the plasma a nd binds the extracellular component of LDL 
receptors (LDLR).  Once bound, the LDLR -PCSK9 complex is internalized and directed 
it to the lysosome for degradation10.  PCSK9 inhibitors have been formulated as 
monoclonal antibodies, designed to bind PCSK9 and prevent this series of events.  As an 
effect, LDLR concentrations on the surface of hepatocytes are increased, and more LDL 
is removed from the cir culation.  
 
Alirocumab (Praluent) is the first FDA -approved PCSK9 inhibitor, approved for primary 
prevention in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or secondary 
prevention in patients with clinically stable atherosclerotic cardiovascula r disease who 
require additional lowering of LDL -cholesterol11. 
 
VCU -AlirocRT – Clinical Protocol   Version [ADDRESS_669788] been no studies of alirocumab or any other PCSK9 inhibitor given 
acutely in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) . 
 
Considering the residual risk of complications and death in patients with AMI, there is an 
urgent clinical need to investigate new strategies for risk reduction in AMI.  A rapid 
reduction of LDL cholesterol within [ADDRESS_669789] care, including high -dose statins.  
 
Moreover, a cross -talk between lipoprotein metabolism and systemic inflammation exists.  
In multiple in vitro studies, PCSK9 has demonstrated influence on receptors other than 
LDLR, including the LDLR -related protein 1 (LRP -1)[ADDRESS_669790] control on the 
IKK/NF -κB pathway by [CONTACT_516843] -114.  PCSK9 appears to have a similar effect on LRP -1 as it does on LDLR (i.e. 
facilitating LRP -1 degradation)15, suggesting that PCSK9 inhibition would prevent this 
process and could have an anti -inflammatory effect.  
 
Macrophages play an important role in atherosclerosis formation and the associated 
inflammatory pathways.  Increased levels of plasm a LDL lead to oxidative modification of 
the LDL particles by [CONTACT_516844] (forming oxLDL), which is then 
recognizable to scavenger receptors (SR), principally SR -CD36 and SR -A16.  Once CD36 
binds oxLDL, it interacts with Toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR6 to activate NF -κB and 
ultimately the inflammasome complex17.  PCSK9 has been shown not only to increase 
levels of circulating LDL, which then promotes CD36 stimulation/upregulation18, but also 
to directly increase the expression of surface CD3619,20.  Thus, CD36  appears to have a 
net proinflammatory effect that is stimulated by [CONTACT_6564]9, and in this manner, PCSK9 
inhibition could again have anti -inflammatory effects.  
 
Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_516828] a 
theoretical basis in the  immune response to pathologic lipoproteic signals (i.e. cell debris 
during myocardial injury or lipopolysaccharide in Gram negative bacteria). Indeed, in a 
mouse model of septic shock, PCSK9 knockout mice or mice receiving PCSK9 
modulators had a more favo rable outcome than their counterparts. Accordingly, 
retrospective evidence from a large clinical study of septic shock showed a correlation 
between estimated PCSK9 activity (extrapolated from detected gain of function or loss of 
function genetic mutations) , the measured inflammatory biomarker levels, and survival 
during septic shock21.  
 
PCSK9 inhibitors have not been tested in acute settings such as AMI. The effects of the 
PCSK9 inhibitors on LDL cholesterol and on the systemic inflammation in AMI are 
unknown .  It has been shown that persistently high levels of IL -6 and CRP during 
admissi on for acute coronary syndrome and at discharge are associated with worse 
outcomes 21,22. In the PROVE -IT trial, despi[INVESTIGATOR_516829] t he time of an ACS, more than 40% of patients had CRP levels 
>2mg/L at 30 days from the index events, and such patients were at increased risk of 
adverse outcomes23.

4) OBJECTIVES  
  4.[ADDRESS_669791] previously been treated with moderate -high intensity 
statins, who present with a type I (spontaneous) acute non -ST segment elevation MI 
(NSTEMI).  Particular attention will be paid to additional LDL lowering effects, as well as 
the effects on PCSK9 levels and inflammatory biomarkers.  
 
Biomarkers will be collected at baseline, [ADDRESS_669792] PCSK9 levels to rise with high intensity statin treatment alone but 
be lowered by [CONTACT_516845].  
 
Lipoprotein(a) . Levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], another well -validated cardiovascular risk 
marker, will be measured at ea ch time point.  We expect a marked reduction in Lp(a) 
levels, as was observed in prior trials using alirocumab.  
 
Inflammatory  biomarkers . High-sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin -6 (IL -
6), IL -10, and tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α) will be measured at each time point.  We 
expect an inflammatory response after an NSTEMI, with a peak in many of the markers 
at [ADDRESS_669793] clinical trial in which 
alirocumab will be given in patients with acute NSTEMI in the inpatient  setting . Subjects 
will be screened for any adverse side effects or events thought potentially related to 
alirocumab treatment immediately after administration of the study injection, at 3 days , 
and at 14 days after the dose.  A complete blood count with differential and complete 
metabolic panel will be drawn at each time point, as well.

 The study is composed of two treatment arms exploring:  
 
a) Alirocumab 150 mg given as a single dose subcutaneously + Atorvastatin 80 
mg orally daily; 
 
b) Matching placebo injection subcutaneously + Atorvastatin 80 mg dail y.  
 
 
6) ENROLLMENT IN THE STUDY  
Patients who are admitted to the Pauley Heart Center in the VCU Medical Center will be 
screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria based on a cursory evaluation of the

waiver of informed consent for authorization to access protected health information to 
allow identification of the subjects. After identifying the potential subjects, the 
investigators will approach the subjects in a private ma nner and review the informed 
consent form approved by [CONTACT_4707] .  Any additional information 
about their medical history that is unclear or incomplete from the medical charts will be 
clarified by [CONTACT_516846] g confirmatory outside medical records , 
with the consent of the patients,  if deemed necessary.  
 
Patients agreeing to participate in the study will sign the informed consent form and will 
be given a copy of the consent form signed by [CONTACT_516847].  No study procedures will occur prior to the subject signing the approved

7) RANDOMIZATION  
 
The Investigational Pharmacist (Robin Sculthorpe, RPh) who wi ll not be involved in 
patient care, data gathering, or data analysis, will be in charge of randomization. Patients 
will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_669797] the VCU Investigational Pharmacy to provide the 
treatment allocation to the PI, who will then relay the information to the treating physician. 
Upon completion of the study (including completion of all data co llection and event 
adjudication), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_516832].  
 
8) TREATMENT WITH THE INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG  
 
After signing of the informed consent, verification of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
obtaining baseline laboratory samples, and randomization, patients will receive their 
VCU -AlirocRT – Clinical Protocol   Version [ADDRESS_669798] informing providers about the 
enrollment in the study and the recommendation to not prescribe PCSK9 inhibitors until 
completion of the trial protocol  (2 wee ks).  This will avoid patients being treated with two 
different PCSK9 inhibitors or with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_516833] .

Patient will have blood samples (approximately 30 mL) drawn at baseline after signing 
the informed consent form but before receiving the study injection.  The panel of 
biomarkers  will include a lipid panel ( total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL -C, triglyceride levels, 
and Lp[a]), PCSK9 levels, inflammatory biomarkers (including hsCRP, IL -6, IL-10, and 
TNF-α), complete blood count (CBC), and complete metabolic panel (CMP) . 
 
After 3 days , or at the time of patient discharge (whichever occurs first), blood samples  
(approximately 30 mL ) will be drawn again to re -measure the biomarkers listed above , 
and the patient will be given an appointment for a visit 14 3 days  from enrollmen t.  At 
their follow up  visit, patients will undergo a repeat history and physical  exam , and blood 
samples (approximately 30 mL) will again be drawn  to re-measure the biomarkers listed 
above .  This will complete the participation of the subjects in the clin ical trial . The patient’s 
clinical care will then continue  on a regular basis, according to standard of care.  
 
Biomarkers  will be measured by [CONTACT_46147] (Cincinnati, OH) .  The tubes will be collected 
by [CONTACT_21724], and immediately inverted 8 -10 times after being drawn. Samples 
are then processed, refrigerated and shipped within 24 hours. The results from LabCorp  
will be sent securely to the PIs and designated investig ators by [CONTACT_54769]/or fax.

10) POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND RISKS  
  10.1  Alirocumab  
Alirocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor which has been shown to significantly lower LDL -
cholesterol, both in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesteremia (HeFH) and 
in patients without HeFH who have clinical atherosclerotic disease.  It is subcutaneously 
administered by [CONTACT_516850] -injector.  Its safety and efficacy have been broadly 
investigated  multiple clinical trials  in patients  with or without HeFH who are already  on 
maximally tolerated  statins, with or without additional lipid -lowering agents5–8.  Patients in  
this study will similarly be required to have been on at least moderate -intensity statin 
therapy prior to presentation for acute MI, and they will receive a single dose of 
alirocumab [ADDRESS_669800] been reported with alirocumab.  Adverse reactions recorded in the 
current reference document for alirocumab are:  injection site rea ctions (including 
erythema/redness, itching, swelling, pain, tenderness), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_516834] (including mainly oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing), pruritis, 
hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticarial, and hypersensitivity vasculitis.  
 
10.2 Social and psychological risks  
 
There is a social/psychological risk in this study of breaching confidentiality and having a 
patient’s diagnosis discovered. The likelihood of this occurring is very low, and will be 
further lowered by [CONTACT_516851] a database that does not link patients’ identity with their clinical 
data. Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk. However, except when required by [CONTACT_2371], 
patients will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, address, or any other 
person al identifier.  
 
10.3 Testing risks  
 
The only study -related testing risks will be those of a venous blood draw, which involves 
minor bleeding (rare) and infection (extremely rare) at the puncture site.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_669801] of attenuating the 
inflammatory response  during acute myocardial infarction . There is no guarantee, 
however, that there is a benefit of using alirocumab in the setting  of acute myocardial 
VCU -AlirocRT – Clinical Protocol   Version [ADDRESS_669802] will receive alirocumab 
as 50% of subjects will receive placebo. Finally, we also cannot exclude the possibility , 
although highly unlikely,  that alirocumab will provide harm in the investigated population.  
In the ODYSSEY Long -Term analysis, indeed, fewer patients experienced a n acute 
myocardial infarction on alirocumab vs placebo (0.9% vs 2.3%, P=0.01), and there is no 
evidence suggesting that the patients who experienced an acute myocardial infarction 
while on alirocumab had a w orse outcome than those on placebo, as shown by a trend 
toward reduced cardiac mortality with alirocumab (0.3% vs 0.9%)5. 
 
11)  ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety parameters will include data deriving from history and physical examination 
performed at each encounter, laboratory data, and results of functional and imaging tests 
obtained as part of standard clinical care. The patient will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_516852].  
Disease -related data will be assessed including change in symptoms (or new symptoms), 
change in functional  capacity, vital signs, and significant changes in medications.  
Data specific to the treatment will also be assessed. The patient will be asked about 
symptoms. Changes to treatment for side -effects or unanticipated problems will be 
performed without breaki ng the randomization code, unless deemed necessary for the 
treatment of the individual patient by [CONTACT_516853], in which case the 
physician will be made aware while the remainder of the team, especially the investigators 
performing and inte rpreting the tests, will be maintained blinded , if possible .  
The risks of the tests performed have been described above. In order to reduce risk, the 
procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_199566].  
11.1 Reporting o f Adverse Events  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
administered a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An AE does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE  can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) 
product, whether or not related to that medicinal (invest igational or non -investigational) 
product.  
The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study 
encounters and interviews of a study recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86770], or upon review by [CONTACT_487085]/or study coordinator. All e vents considered AEs including local and 
systemic reactions will be recorded on the appropriate AE form . Information to be 
collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study intervention (assessed  only by [CONTACT_71495] a diagnosis, which would include a physician) and time of resolution/stabilization 
of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately 
regardless of relationship. All AEs wi ll be followed to adequate resolution.  All AEs must 
be graded for severity and relationship to study product.  
VCU -AlirocRT – Clinical Protocol   Version 02012017  
15 
  
Severity of Event . All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_516854]:  
 Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the daily  
activities.  
 Moderate : events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning and may 
require local or systemic drug therapy.  
 Severe : events interrupt a patient’s  usual daily activity and will likely require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
 Life threatening : any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the 
view of the investigator, at immediat e risk of death from the reaction as it occurred (it 
does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death).  
 
Relationship to the intervention . All suspected AEs must have their relationship to study 
intervention a ssessed using the terms: associated or not associated.  
 
 Definitely related : The event is temporally related to the administration of the study 
intervention and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], no other etiology explains the event.  
 Probably related : The event is temporally related to the administration of the study 
intervention and represents, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the most plausible 
explanation of the event.  
 Possibly related : The event is temporally related to the administration of the st udy 
intervention but, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it does not represent the most likely 
explanation of the event.  
 Definitely Unrelated : The event is temporally independent of study intervention and/or 
the event appears, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_35272], to be explained by [CONTACT_128930].  
 
An unexpected event  means an event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent 
with the applicable product information.  An expected adverse drug reaction  with a fatal 
outcome should be considered unexpe cted unless the local/regional product labelling 
specifically states that the event might be associated with a fatal outcome.  
 
A serious adverse event ( SAE) is any adverse event/experience occurring between 
baseline assessments and the patients final study  visit that results in any of the following 
outcomes and is considered by [CONTACT_093](s) to be unexpected or not consistent with 
the natural history of the disease:  
 Death ; 
 Life threatening (subject at immediate risk of death) ; 
 Requires inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_1081] ; 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity ; 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon appropriate medical 
VCU -AlirocRT – Clinical Protocol   Version [ADDRESS_669803] be provided.  
 
Any event requiring in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (or the prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
must be reported as a SAE.  
 
Admi ssions to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516835]:  
 Social reasons, e.g. overnight stay because of distance between home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
 Surgery or procedure planned and documented prior to entry into the study  
 
All serious adverse eve nts that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have 
not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be 
followed until any of the following occurs:  
 The event resolves  
 The event stabilizes  
 The event returns to  baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  
 The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated 
to study conduct  
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health 
care practiti oner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after 
demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts)  
 
Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) : An adverse event of special interest (AESI) 
is an adverse event (serious or non -serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to 
the investigational medicinal product  (IMP), for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_516855] ( MAH ) may be 
appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and 
understand them. AESIs may be added or removed during a study by [CONTACT_514164].  
For this study, the AESI are:  
o Increase in alanine aminotransferase ( ALT): 
 ALT >[ADDRESS_669804] unless associated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
increase (AST>ALT) and clearly attributed to cardiac cause . 
o Allergic events.  
 Allergic drug reactions and/or local injection site reactions deemed to be 
allergic by [CONTACT_737] (or have an allergic component), that require 
consultation with another physician for further evaluation of 
hypersensitivity/allergy as per the Investigator’s medical judgment should be 
reported as an AESI.  
o Pregnan cy: 
 Pregnancy occurring in a female patient enrolled in the study will be recorded 
as a pre -specified AE with immediate notification in all cases, and IMP should 
VCU -AlirocRT – Clinical Protocol   Version 02012017  
17 
 be discontinued in all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the 
SAE crite ria. The follow -up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the 
outcome of the pregnancy has been determined.  
 Pregnancy occurring in the female partner of a male patient included in the 
clinical trial: if permitted by [CONTACT_516856], 
it will be recorded as a pre -specified AE with immediate notification (SAE if it 
fulfills the SAE criteria), and pregnancy should be followed -up until the 
outcome has been determined.  
o Symptomatic overdose with IMP:  
 An overdose (accidental or  intentional) is an event suspected by [CONTACT_495574] (not based on systematic 
injection counts) and defined as at least twice of the intended dose within the 
intended therapeutic interval (ie, 2 or more injection s are administered in <7 
calendar days), to be reported using the Term “symptomatic OVERDOSE 
(accidental or intentional), indicating the circumstance in parentheses (eg, 
“symptomatic overdose [accidental]” or “symptomatic overdose [intentional]”). 
The pati ent should be monitored and appropriate symptomatic treatment 
instituted.  
 The circumstances of the overdose should be clearly specified in the verbatim.  
o Neurologic events:  
 Neurologic events that require additional examinations/procedures and/or 
referral to  a specialist should be reported as an AESI. If the event does not 
require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a specialist, it 
should be reported as a standard AE.  
o Neurocognitive events  
 All neurocognitive events will be considered as AES I 
 
 New Safety Finding  means any (other than reportable individual case safety report 
(ICSR)) safety issue that may require expedited reporting because providing 
information that may lead to a change in the known risk -benefit balance for the product 
and as mentioned, but not limited to, in the following regulatory texts: Europe: Volume 
9A of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union (September 
2008) Section 4.1 ; and US: FDA: 21 CFR Parts 312 Investigational New Drug 
Application - Section 31 2.32, (c) (1) IND safety reports . 
 
Instructions:  
 All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) regardless of the relationship to a 
Regeneron/ [COMPANY_011] product and all Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) must 
be reported to Regeneron/ [COMPANY_011] within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event  
 
Reports by E -MAIL should be sent to: [EMAIL_2375]  or Fax: 908 -547-
8000, within 24 hours of receipt by [CONTACT_1697]/sponsor. E-Mail or Fax transmission

 The Sponsor must provide to Regenron/ [COMPANY_011] upon request, results of any relevant 
complementary exams performed to obtain the final diagnosis of any SAE or AESI  
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], autopsy, consultation).  
 
 The sponsor shall be responsible for ensuring submission of req uired expedited and 
periodic reports to the appropriate Regulatory Authority (RA), the Ethics Committee 
and investigators of each country participating in the  Investigator -Sponsored Study  
(ISS, based on applicable regulations).

12)  DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL  
 
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time. The patient can decide to forgo any 
study procedures that makes him/her uncomfortable or wish not to complete. The study 
doctor may however stop the participation of the patient in this study at any time for many 
reasons including (but not limited to)  the study doctor thinks it is necessary for patient 
health or safety, the patient has not followed study instructions, or administrative reasons 
requiring withdrawal.  
 
Loss to follow -up can occur due to patients’ withdrawal or death. If patients are lost to 
follow up and their clinical condition cannot be established (alive vs dead, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516836]), they will be excluded from the initial analysis, and then reintroduced for sensitivity 
analysis considering all potential outcomes. A 10% attrition rate is a reasonable 
assumption.  
 
13)  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
13.1 Sample Size  
 
In the ODYSSEY Long Term trial, the addition of alirocumab 150 mg to maximally 
tolerated statin therapy resulted in a reduction of LDL cholesterol of approximately 60% 
at 4 weeks5.  Similar LDL reductions were seen even when used in statin -intolerant 
VCU -AlirocRT – Clinical Protocol   Version [ADDRESS_669805] baseline LDL levels of approximately 124 mg/dL on first presentati on2, and that 
a >40% in LDL reduction will be observed after treatment with alirocumab  + atorvastatin 
80 mg  on top of  what is seen with placebo +  atorvastatin 80 mg at 2 weeks  (primary 
endpoint) , with a standard deviation  of approximately 25% .  These estimates lead to a 
predicted power >99% ( =0.01) with a sample size of 20 patients , and of  >95%  with a 
25% loss to follow up at [ADDRESS_669806] increased CRP levels, peaking at 72 hours22,23. A sample size of 20 
patients will also provide a power of 65 -85% to detect a reduction of 33 -50% in CRP or 
IL-6 plasma levels at 72 hours or 14 days with alirocumab  + atorvastatin 80 mg on top of 
placebo + atorvastatin 80 mg (secondary endpoint) . 
13.2 Analysis of the data  
Continuous variables will be reported as median and interquartile, because of potential 
deviation from Gaussian distribution. Discrete variables will be reported as N and %. For 
the primary endpoint, the comparison in the interval c hange in LDL cholesterol between 
alirocumab and placebo will be completed using an ANOVA for repeated measures and 
assessing the P value for time_x_group allocation. P values <0.05 will be considered 
significant. Missing data will not be input. For the pur pose of safety analysis, all patients 
receiving the investigational drug will be considered, independent of missing data.

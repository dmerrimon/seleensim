Planned Analysis  
Safety data set  
Safety set includes all eyes with attempted test article implantation (successful or aborted 
after contact [CONTACT_222199]). The safety set will be used for all safety analyses including the 
primary safety endpoint analysis. Modified safety se t includes all eyes with successful test 
article implantation. The modified safety set will be used for a sensitivity analysis of the 
primary safety endpoint.  
Primary Safety:  
The rate of post -surgical intraocular inflammation (based upon the specified case  
definition) reported within a [ADDRESS_379287] -surgical period following attempted 
implantation of an ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  Toric IOL  or ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR IOL  
(Cohort 2) in the US  will be estimated along with the exact two -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI). The event rate (per 1,000 IOL implants) is  
Total # of reported events / Total # of implants  1,000.  
A subgroup analysis on the primary safety endpoint will be performed by [CONTACT_551] 
(22-64 years vs. 65 years or older). If both eyes of a subject are enrolled in this study, full 
follow -up information for both eyes will be used in the primary analysis. As sensitivity 
analyses, two cumulative event rates at 180 days and the corresponding two -sided 95% 
confidence interval will be provided using Kaplan -Meier estima tor: 
• Full follow -up information for both eyes is used

Secondary Safety:  
The rates of Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome, acute postoperative endophthalmitis , 
chronic postoperative endophthalmitis , and uncategorized cases of  post-surgical intraocular 
inflammation  (based upon the specified case definition), respectively, re ported within a 
180-day post -surgical period following implantation of ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  Toric IOL

7.1 Background  
The ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +3.0 D Multifocal Toric IOL and ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  
+2.[ADDRESS_379310] the pre -existing corneal 
astigmatism by [CONTACT_309408]. ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +3.0 
D Multifocal Toric IOL Models SND1T3 – SND1T6 were a pproved in the [LOCATION_002] on 
22 December  2016.  The ACRYSOF IQ RESTOR  +2.5 D Multifocal Toric IOL Models 
SV25T3 -T6 were approved in the [LOCATION_002] on 21 March  2017 . The ACRYSOF IQ 
RESTOR +2.5 D Multifocal IOL Model SV25T0 was approved in the [LOCATION_002] on 13 
April 2015.  
Multifocal IOLs are designed to provide improved overall vision at near and intermediate 
distances when compared to conventional monofocal IOLs (Javitt 2000 , Chiam  2006 , 
Kohnen 2006 , Souza 2006 , Vingolo 2007 , Alfonso  2009).  Toric intraocular lense s correct 
aphakia as well as any pre -existing or surgically induced corneal astigmatism (Horn 2007 , 
Bauer 2008). This provides a benefit to patients due to freedom from spectacles for distance 
vision which is an important consideration when choosing an int raocular lens (Lane 2006 , 
Larendeau 2009).  
A summary of known and potential risks and benefits to humans, as identified in the literature 
or through preclinical testing and/or prior clinical evaluations, for each investigational 
product can be found in the Package Insert for the corresponding model.  
Risks associated with participation in the clinical investigation including risks associated with 
the clinical procedure are described in the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Information on 
alternative treatments t hat may be available to the subjects is also addressed in the ICF.

9.6 Study Recruitment and Entry  
Participants will be recruited from the  Investigators ’ patient population, referrals, or IRB 
approved materials. Patients that appear to be eligible subjects will be approached for study 
participation and sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to the commencement of study 
related procedures.  
The Investigator or designee will explain the study purpose, procedures and subject 
responsibilities to the potential participant. The subject must be given the opportunity to ask 
questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. The subjec t’s willingness 
and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be determined. When it has been 
established that the subject is eligible for possible participation in the study, written informed 
consent will be obtained. Upon signing the ICF, the subje ct will be enrolled into the study. 
The original signed informed consent form will be retained within the subject ’s medical 
records, and a copy will be provided to the subject.

12.4 Discontinued Subjects  
Subjects may be discontinued (exited) from the study early due to:  
• Failure to meet protocol eligibility criteria prior to surgery  
• Adverse event(s)  
• Administrative reasons (eg, voluntary withdrawal, lost to follow -up) 
Subjects who fail to meet protocol eligibility criteria prior to the investigational product 
touching the eye  will not be followed beyond the date of de termination of ineligibility. 
Implanted subjects and subjects with failed implantation (inability to successfully insert the 
study IOL ) will be followed until the planned end of the study period.  
Discontinued subje cts who have been implanted or in whom implantation failed will not be 
replaced. Notification of a subject ’s early discontinuation should be made immediately to the 
Sponsor and documented on the appropriate eCRF.  
If a subject exits the study before complet ion of the final, planned study visit 
(Visit  4/Visit  4A), the Investigator should make reasonable attempts to have the subject return 
to the site to perform early exit procedures. Early exit procedures are all study procedures to

13.1 General Information  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered 
a clinical study  treatment (ie, implant with an investigational device) regardless of whether or 
not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any 
unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the clinical study  treatment, whether or not related to the 
treatment. Below are Figures that categorize AEs and SAEs.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is an AE that led to any of the following:  
• Death  
• A serious deterior ation in the health of the subject that either resulted in:  
a) a life -threatening illness or injury.  
Note: Life -threatening means that the individual was at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred, ie, it does not include an event which 
hypothe tically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe 
form.  
b) any potentially sight -threatening event or permanent impairment to a body 
structure or a body function.  
c) in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266].  
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309405] a pre -existing condition, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE. In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309406]/or treatment (usually involving  an 
overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's 
office or an out -patient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147194], the ev ent is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ” occurred, the event should be considered 
serious.  
d) a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b) or any ocular 
secondary surgical intervention (excluding posterior capsulotomy).  
e) any indi rect harm as a consequence of incorrect diagnostic test results 
when used within manufacturer ’s instructions for use.  
• Fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
Any othe r potentially sight -threatening events may also be consi dered serious based upon the 
judgment of the Investigator and should be reported appropriately as delineated in 
Section  13.3.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of an investigational product (test 
article). This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for 
use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; any malfunction; and use error or 
intentional misuse of the test article.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect  
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is an ADE that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a SAE.  
Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  
An anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is a SADE which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, severity, or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report.  
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) is a SADE which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the risk analysis report.  
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. This definition includes malfunctions, use 
errors, and inadequate labeling. Malfunction is defined as a failure of a medical device to 
perform in accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance with the 
instructions for use or clinical investigation plan. Use error is defined as an act or omission of 
an act that results in a different medical device response than intended by [CONTACT_309417]; this includes slips, lapses, and mista kes. An unexpected physiological 
response of the subject does not in itself constitute a use error.  
A device deficiency may or may not be associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); 
however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due to a device deficiency. The Inv estigator should 
determine the applicable category for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report 
any patient harm separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specificatio ns (eg, incorrect IOL powe r) 
• IOL defect  
• Broken IOL optic

Study Sponsor contact [CONTACT_309419] (MOP) .  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
Sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could hav e led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
For every AE and device deficiency, the Investigator must assess the causality as Related or 
Not Related to the medical device or test p rocedure in the study. An assessment of causality 
will also be performed by a study Sponsor physician utilizing the same definitions, as shown 
below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE or device deficiency classified as related may be either definitely 
related or pos sibly related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the 
medical device or test procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a 
reasonable possibility that the AE or device deficiency was caused by [CONTACT_309420].  
Not R elated  An AE or device deficiency classified as not related may either be definitely 
unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (ie, there are other more likely 
causes for the AE or device deficiency).  
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the in tensity (severity) of the AE as mild, 
moderate, or severe, based upon medical judgment with consideration of any subjective 
symptom(s), as defined below:

Alcon – Business Use Only  Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign o r 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
The Investigator must document any action taken (ie, medication, intervention, or treatment 
plan) and outcome of the AE or device deficiency when applicable.

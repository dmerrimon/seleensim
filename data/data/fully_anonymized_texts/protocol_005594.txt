Patient participants (up to n = 25) will be recruited from the UNLV PRACTICE, UNLV campus, and
the general community (see below). 
This is a single-arm trial focused on feasibility and acceptability as well as preliminary clinical
response (e.g., improvement in anxiety symptoms, engagement of purported psychological
mechanism of avoidance) for a future R-series application to NIMH. There is no power analysis for
such exploratory work; the sample sizes are not powered to detect treatment effects or statistical
significance. Rather, these sample size estimates are determined by [CONTACT_554752]-of-concept and identify preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness alongside
initial demonstration of clinical impact.

Describe how subjects will be recruited.
Coach Participants: Coaches will first be recruited by [CONTACT_554756]/post-baccalaureate students affiliated or interested in working with the
PI/TREATment Lab. [CONTACT_554787] gets an average of 10 -15 inquiries per academic year from
psychology majors and minors interested in serving as undergraduate/post-bacc research
assistants.  These students will be given a brief description of the study in a 15-min introductory
Zoom meeting with the PI, which includes an overview of the lab, basic description of the study, and
overview of basic time commitment. If they are interested and, they will undergo informed consent
procedures. (The brief description of the study will map onto the email uploaded for subsequent
recruitment.)
If recruitment as described above yields an insufficient number of coaches, they will be
additionally recruited through email distribution via the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554719] (including referrals from labs in the Department of Psychology), the UNLV
Mental and Behavioral Health Coalition (comprised of faculty across UNLV mental and behavioral
health disciplines), and the UNLV PRACTICE (interdisciplinary training clinic). See attached email.
The email will ask faculty to forward the email information to students they recommend who may be
eligible and interested. Students are asked to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_173003].
Patient Participants: They will be recruited from a variety of clinical or community partners, or
directly from the community via bulletin postings/ads and distribution of flyers to primary care clinics,
UNLV PRACTICE (training clinic), other mental health organizations/clinics, community
organizations (e.g., libraries), mental health organizations (e.g., National Alliance on Mental Illness),
low-income housing, and social service settings (including senior centers, community centers). We
also request permission to post a recruitment ad on UNLV Today (e-newsletter) if other community
recruitment sources do not yield the desired sample size.
The study will also be posted on the PI's lab website (  and on http://brennarenn.faculty.unlv.edu/)

Access to treatment for common mental health conditions (namely, depression and anxiety) is limited
across the U.S., due in part to shortage of available providers. According to a 2022 report from the UNLV
Lincy Institute, all of Nevada's counties are federally designated mental health provider shortage areas,
and the state ranks last in the nation for mental health metrics like access to care and high prevalence of
mental illness
(https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=bmw_lincy_health)Global
mental health initiatives are bridging this gap with provider task sharing, in which tasks are redistributed in
a stepped care model. With this model, low-intensity behavioral health services are delivered by
[CONTACT_554757] (NSPs) under appropriate supervision, thereby [CONTACT_554758] . The need for such services is great in low- to middle-income countries, and such
strategies are readily translatable to high-income countries. Notably, in England, task sharing is the
linchpin of the National Health Service’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554720] (IAPT;
recently renamed The NHS Talking Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], for anxiety and depression programme), in which
psychological well-being practitioners deliver structured, low-intensity behavioral interventions for
depression and anxiety disorders within a stepped care model. These practitioners have the U.S.
equivalent of college coursework and no prior specialized training in mental health. Such a model has
served as the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_554721]; however, development and deployment
of such models in the U.S. are rare. There have been a few demonstrations of nonspecialist providers
delivering brief structured treatments for depression; to date, only one published study (Stanley et al.) has
investigated this model for anxiety treatment. While Stanley and colleagues' findings were promising, the
intervention they delivered was akin to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), consisting of 12
sessions. Pressing is the need for briefer, streamlined interventions (e.g., 6-8 sessions) appropriate for
non-speciality settings such as primary care, where the majority of people receive diagnosis and treatment
for common mental health conditions.In response to the large numbers of individuals with untreated
anxiety and the lack of mental health specialists, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_218147] a brief structured intervention
program for anxiety, designed to be delivered by [CONTACT_105]-specialists (“coaches”). The focus of this intervention
is to provide individuals with education about anxiety, guide them to track their symptoms, teach different
ways of thinking about situations, assist them with re-engaging with activities. The treatment is based on
evidence-based principles of strategies of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a gold standard treatment
for anxiety disorders. The goal of this intervention is to reduce symptoms of anxiety and accompanying
distress in individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety conditions. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_554722]. The findings are expected to create a
foundation to inform acceptable, effective, and sustainable mental health care within various non-specialty
community and clinical infrastructures.Select references:Hoeft, T. J., Fortney, J. C., Patel, V., & Unützer,

Note: DO NOT copy and paste directly from your grant proposal, dissertation prospectus,
clinical protocol, etc.
This study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and preliminary clinical outcomes in
a single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility trial. A sample of up to 25 adult individuals with clinically significant anxiety
(“patient participants”) will be recruited from the community. These participants will receive 8 weekly
sessions of a brief, structured intervention for anxiety. The intervention will be delivered by a trained and
supervised “coach.” Coaches will be UNLV students with advanced standing (juniors or seniors) or recent
graduates at the bachelor's level. They will be trained and supervised by [CONTACT_978]. Assessments will
measure the acceptability and appropriateness of the intervention and non-specialist delivery, and assess
participants' anxiety, avoidance, and disability/functioning. Investigators will also measure the adequacy of
recruitment, enrollment, and retention strategies, as well as the retention, attitudes, and compliance of
coaches. Differences between pre- and post-intervention patient participant outcomes will be calculated as
preliminary evidence of intervention effectiveness, to be tested in a future randomized controlled trial
powered to detect treatment effects.

This study largely replicates the methods of a prior trial of nonspecialist-delivered treatment for
depression and extends it to a new intervention strategy (STARS program) for anxiety. This prior
trial was conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_554723] (the University of Washington, Seattle, WA;

30-min sessions (although the first session may last 45-to-60-min) conducted individually between a
coach and patient participant. The first session focuses on (a) psychoeducation, (b) explaining the
CBT model of anxiety, (c) selecting specific treatment targets from either worry management (for
generalized anxiety symptoms; notably, uncontrollable worry) and exposure (for panic, phobia, or
other anxiety related to avoidance), and (d) creating an exposure action plan ("homework; planned
anxiety treatment activities for the week). Subsequent sessions focus on success or difficulties with
the homework/activity plan for the week, including measurement-based care using repeated
assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms to track treatment response.

from the UNLV and greater Las Vegas Valley community and enroll them if they have clinically
significant symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7] scale scores equal to or
greater than 8) and otherwise meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
1. Eligibility screening will be conducted via telephone by a trained TREATment lab research
assistant. Potential participants will first be told about the general structure and purpose of the
eligibility screening.
We will collect name, age (to ensure 18 or older), and contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone, mailing address
as well as current location, email). This will be entered into the Master List for the parent study, in
part to ensure that we do not screen the same person multiple times. Potential patient participants
will first be screened with a 7-item anxiety screener (GAD-7; routinely used in primary care and
other routine care settings, with good psychometric properties for research and clinical purposes).
Only those with threshold anxiety symptoms (score of ≥8 on GAD-7; cut score selected to maximize
sensitivity) will proceed to further eligibility evaluation. This includes, in order:
- Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ; a screener for bipolar disorder),
- Medication list (name, dose, frequency)
- AUDIT, a screener for alcohol misuse,
- Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), a screener for other substance misuse,
- psychosis screening questions; 
- MacLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSI-BPD; a screener for
borderline personality disorder), and
- Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS); a screener for suicide risk
See assessment schedule (attached). 
All assessment measures for Eligibility Screening will be conducted over the telephone by a trained
research assistant. The RA will ask the participant each question and will record the response in the
study database. Screening data will not be used for research purposes other than determining
participant recruitment and enrollment  per CONSORT guidelines and future study feasibility
planning (e.g., proportion of sample ineligible for particular reasons). It may also be reference
during the study in case an individual calls again to attempt to re-enroll after initial screening (e.g.,
told they're ineligible, and then they call back). Once the Master List is destroyed at the end of the
study, all screening data will be retained as part of the parent dataset but will be deidentified.
No portion of the screening assessment administration will be recorded. Any endorsement of an
exclusion criteria will cease participation in the screener as soon as the assessment measure is
complete (e.g., once the entire MDQ is completed, not just a single item on the
MDQ). Ineligible participants will be informed of the following: "We have completed our screening
questions and I appreciate your time. I'm sorry, but our criteria for you to continue in the study have
not been met." They will be offered a list of community resources for mental health services (see
attached).
All identifying information collected as part of the eligibility screener will be stored in an electronic
database on a secure server and will be password protected. Eligibility screening data will be
labeled with a unique study identification number. The link between the personal identifiers and the
related eligibility screening data will be kept until the end of the study. Deidentified information will
be kept indefinitely.
Patient Participants: Baseline and Subsequent Assessments; STARS Program
1. Baseline assessment:
Participants who are eligible upon screening will be asked to schedule a baseline assessment and
first STARS session. This will be in-person at UNLV TREATment lab space on main campus.
Informed consent for the intervention study will occur at this visit.
First, the patient participant will meet with a research assistant for approximately [ADDRESS_728563] describe the study, answer any questions, and obtain informed consent. At that
point, patient participants will be considered "enrolled." They will then complete a clinical interview
(HAM-A) administered by [CONTACT_21118], provide demographic information, and complete six additional
self-report study measures (ASI-3, OASIS, MEAQ, CAQ, WHODAS, ISI): 
- Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), an interviewer-rated measure consisting of 14 items,
each defined by a series of symptoms, to measure both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and
psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). A
corresponding interview guide will be used to increase the reliability. This measure has
demonstrated sensitivity to change in clinical trials.
- Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-3), an 18- item self-report scale containing items specifying different
concerns someone could have regarding their anxiety.
-    Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS), a 5-item self-report scale quantifying
anxiety-related distress and impairment 
- Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (MEAQ), a 62-item self report assessment
of avoidance. To be used to measure activation of target mechanism of avoidance.
- Cognitive Avoidance Questionnaire (CAQ); a 25-item self-report measure of the tendency to
employ cognitive avoidance strategies when dealing with threatening intrusive thoughts. To be used
to measure activation of target mechanism of avoidance.
- World Health Organization’s Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0); this 12-item
generic health-status measure assesses functioning across six domains: communication, mobility,
self-care, interpersonal, life activities, and participation. Item scores (0 = no difficulty to 4 = extreme
difficulty or cannot do) are summed, with higher scores representing greater disability.
- Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); 7-item self-report questionnaire to assess cooccurring sleep
difficulties (prevalent in anxiety)
2. First STARS Session: 
After completing the Baseline Assessment, the patient ppt will meet with their study "coach" for
approximately [ADDRESS_728564] session of the STARS program.  Patient participants will complete
a brief self-report inventories of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7]) and
co-occurring depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) at the beginning
of every STARS session. These assessments are used in routine mental health care and primary
care settings. These will be reviewed in session by [CONTACT_554763],
identify session needs, and reinforce patient attempts at change. These scores will also be used by
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_554727].
The patient ppt will also complete the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) and the Working
Alliance Inventory-short form (WAI-SF) at the end of Session 1, after treatment rationale has been
explained. These will be paper forms that will be entered into the study database by [CONTACT_21118].
Both the baseline assessment and STARS session will be audio recorded for training and fidelity
review.
3. Subsequent STARS sessions:
The patient ppt will meet with their assigned Coach for [ADDRESS_728565] 30 min. These sessions will be audio recorded and uploaded to the study database
alongside the patient ppt's responses to GAD-[ADDRESS_728566]. Renn.
4. Subsequent assessments
See the Assessment Schedule for details of follow-up assessments. 
Patient Participants: Patient participants will complete post-intervention assessments at Week 8,
including brief exit interview questions of their experiences. They will also  complete follow-up
assessments to assess maintenance of treatment effects at 6 and 12 weeks after completion of
treatment. These assessments can be conducted by [CONTACT_62141], in-person at UNLV, or over the
telephone. Patient participants will receive $40 incentive payment for completion of each
assessment (baseline, post-treatment, 6- and 12-week follow-up) for a total possible incentive of
$160.
Assessments and STARS sessions will be audio recorded for training and fidelity review.
BL, Wk 8, FU 1, FU2:
For all study-related assessment timepoints once enrolled, an RA will conduct the HAM-A clinical
interview. The remaining instruments will be completed as self-report forms either using paper
forms, for RA entry into the study database, or entered directly into the study database as survey
responses by [CONTACT_2299].
For BL and Wk [ADDRESS_728567] time to complete the remaining self-report inventories.
For follow-up assessments (FU 1 and FU 2), the HAM-A will be conducted over the telephone
and/or Zoom. The self-report forms will be completed either over the telephone (by [CONTACT_554764]-report from the patient participant) or possibly by [CONTACT_110191] a survey link via REDCap. (Note:
UNLV REDCap is still pending as of 7/11/[ADDRESS_728568] not yet been trialed to see if we can build this function into our database.)
STARS Visits:
At each STARS visit, the participant will complete a GAD-7 (anxiety screen) and PHQ-9 (depression
screen) at the start of session. This will be a paper self-report form that is then used in session for
review between the coach and patient participant as is often the case in routine clinical care. This
data will be entered by [CONTACT_554765].
**All assessments will be labeled only with the Study ID number, visit number (e.g., BL for
baseline), and date of visit. The electronic study database will be the ultimate record for data
capture; any responses on paper forms will be immediately transferred to the study database (same
day) by [CONTACT_554766].**
Risk of Harm Protocol (Patient Participants).
During screening, potential patient participants will be asked explicitly and specifically about
suicidality to ensure appropriateness and eligibility for this study. It is possible that responses may
"trigger" the risk of harm protocol, including any positive responses to CSSRS items 1 ("Have you
wished you were dead or wished  you could go to sleep and not wake up?") or 2 ("have you actually
had any thoughts of killing  yourself?"). The CSSRS administration will be followed, such that any
positive response to Item [ADDRESS_728569] immediate access to the PI ([CONTACT_554787]) for questions or for [CONTACT_554787] to
contact [CONTACT_554767] (e.g., calling emergency services to conduct a wellness
check).
Throughout the study, suicidal thoughts or behaviors may be identified such as on the PHQ-9 (item
#9, “Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself in some way?”) or in
conversation (e.g., self-report of a patient participant during STARS session). If a participant
endorses a score of ≥ 1 on item #[ADDRESS_728570] these screenings. They also receive
supplemental training such as video tutorials in proper admiration of the Columbia Suicide Severity

 Primary assessment of coach participants will occur through Coach Participant Assessment.
observation of their performance in role plays and STARS sessions.  Coach participants will be paid
$10 per session completed with a patient participant (x 8 sessions = up to $80 per patient). They
will also be invited to participate in a post-study qualitative interview. We request flexibility in this
exit interview, per the standards of qualitative methodology (see attached coach interview
guide). The interview will last no longer than [ADDRESS_728571] party. The transcripts will be deidentified and audio files will be deleted after transcription. The
interview will be conducted by a TREATment lab research assistant(s). The interview will focus on
the coach participant’s experience (1) learning the intervention, (2) delivering the intervention, and
(3) other comments about the intervention or implementation. Coaches will receive $50 for
participation in the exit interview.

Patient Participants.
All consenting and assessment activities conducted with patient ppts will be conducted by [CONTACT_554768]'s TREATment Lab.
Prior to study enrolment, potential patient participants will complete an eligibility screening assessment
that will ask demographic questions, basic contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., name, date of birth, phone number,
current physical location/address in the event of an emergency, and email), and inclusion/exclusion
criteria that include questions about anxiety, mood, alcohol use, other mental health factors, and a brief
suicidality assessment. Participants will be verbally provided with study information that outlines the
purpose of the screening assessment. Stated agreement to proceed with procedures will be obtained prior
to continuing the screening portion of the study.
Patient participants eligible for the full study based on the screening assessment will be scheduled for an
in-person meeting  to be consented for the main study, sign a hardcopy consent form, completed baseline
assessment measures, and meet with their STARS program coach to begin the program.  They will be
provided with a copy of the consent form for their records and future reference.
Coach Participants.
The study PI ([CONTACT_554787]) will obtain consent from all coaches at the beginning of the first
Zoom-based training session. [CONTACT_554787] will send a PDF copy of the informed consent form to each coach
individually ahead of the scheduled time, and she will be available for questions or concerns in advance of
the group call. On the group call, everyone will have the chance to ask questions in front of one another or
request a 1:1 "breakout room" discussion with [CONTACT_554787] via Zoom. If anyone is uncertain, they can
participate in the first training prior to providing consent, as no information will be gathered from coach
ppts at this point. Then [CONTACT_554787] will meet individually with that person to obtain consent.

Compensation
Will subjects be paid or otherwise compensated for research participation?
NOTE: UNLV has implemented the Forte Research Payments System as the central
system to electronically manage incentives for UNLV research participants. The system
will pay research participants via VISA credit card, check, or direct account deposit.
Please contact [EMAIL_4579] if you have questions about the use of Forte, to
begin the process, or want to receive a waiver in order to use an alternative
payment method.
✔Yes
State the amount of compensation and describe the nature of any
compensation to subjects (e.g. gift card, research credit, extra credit, gift,
etc.). 
Coach Participants: Coach participants will be paid $10 per session completed with a
patient participant (x 8 sessions = up to $80 per patient). Coaches will receive $50 for
participation in the exit interview.Patient Participants: Patient participants will receive
$40 incentive payment for each completed assessment (baseline, post-treatment,
follow-up 1, follow-up 2). These will be issued in the form of a Forte payment card and
reloaded as indicated. Total for completion of all assessments: $160. Attendance in
STARS interventions are not incentivized.
No
*required
Indicate the method of payment.
✔Forte System Gift Card
The Forte Research Payment System asks for participant identifiers (name,
gender, email, mailing address, and date of birth). In the consent form,
please include that participants may be asked to provide their name,
gender, email, mailing address, and date of birth for compensation
purposes. Specify if these identifiers will or will not be linked to their study
data.
Research Credit/Extra Credit

*required
When and how is the compensation provided to the subject?
Most studies require partial compensation be given for partial participation. Please
address if payment will be prorated. 
Coach Participants: Coaches will earn incentives per session completed (or, if the patient
participant ends the session prematurely, the coach will still earn payment). Although recruitment
and training will emphasize the desire for coaches to see approximately 3 patient participants each
to learn and improve on their intervention delivery, there is no consequence if they do not see that
many patient participant; payment will still be based per session. All coaches who enroll will be
invited to complete the exit interview to ensure variety of viewpoints; for this, they are eligible to
receive $50 payment.Patient Participants: Study participation entails several assessments along the
time course of study completion. Participating in assessments is incentivized; there is no monetary
incentive for participating in the investigational psychotherapy. Participants may elect to discontinue
treatment and still complete assessments, for which they will receive compensation.

*required
Potential Risks
Examples of risk include physical risks, psychological risks (such as stress, discomfort, or
invasion of privacy) and social risks (such as jeopardy to insurability or employability).
Describe immediate risks, long-term risks, the rationale for the necessity of such risks,
alternatives that were or will be considered, and why alternatives may not be
feasible.  Describe any potential legal, financial, social, or personal effects on subjects
of accidental data disclosure.
 Coach participant risk consists of possible personal distress while speaking with Coach participants :
anxious patient participants about their psychological symptoms; medical or psychiatric
emergencies that may arise during interactions with patient participants; and inadvertent breach of
confidentiality related to information about their performance and fidelity.
The nature of working in such "therapeutic" or interventional contexts with individuals with mental
health symptoms means there are no viable alternative to the risks of potential distress or
unanticipated emergencies; see below as to how we seek to prevent and minimize these risks to
both coaches and  patient participants.
 Patient participating in this study may be exposed to the following risks: Patient participants :
(a)  : It is not believed that the risk of these Risks of worsening mental or emotional state
depressive, anxious, suicidal, or other adverse outcomes are increased as a function of being
enrolled in this study. It is well known that merely asking about mood or suicidal ideation does not
increase the risk of adverse mental health outcomes. We will screen for active/acute suicidality,
history of suicide attempt(s), and other mental health conditions that are inappropriate for this
intervention (i.e., psychosis, mania/hypomania, active substance abuse) as an exclusion criterion.
However, we detail the procedures to mitigate potential risk of emergent suicidality during the
course of the study below ("What procedures will be utilized to prevent/minimize any potential
risks?").
(b)  : Evidence-based mental health intervention programs are Risks associated with the intervention
not expected to cause any harm. The intervention under evaluation is based on principles of
evidence-based practice from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a first-line treatment for anxiety,
depression, and other common mental health interventions. However, patient participants may
experience temporarily exacerbated symptoms of anxiety (typi[INVESTIGATOR_554730]) while they
are engaging in therapeutic activities to target avoidance of worry/anxiety/fear. They are told that
this is expected and indicates the treatment is working.
(c)  : Study assessments include questions Risks associated with study assessment s
about depression, anxiety, and other mental and emotional problems that may make
study participants experience discomfort or stress. Participants can choose to take a break;
assessors are also trained in how to empathically and sensitivity deliver such assessments.  The
instruments used throughout the study are well tested, frequently used in clinical practice and
clinical research, and are not known to directly cause problems or distress in participants.
(d)  : Social or personal effects of accidental Risks associated with potential loss of confidentiality
data disclosure could result in shame or embarrassment, particularly if data related to their mental
health is breached. There is also the remote possibility that research records could be subpoenaed
by a court of law. All of these potential losses of confidentiality and measures to protect security will
be disclosed in the consent documents.
Study data will be collected and stored using REDCap, a secure web application for building and
managing online surveys and databases. REDCap is used by [CONTACT_46431] 4,[ADDRESS_728573]
indicated that a HIPAA compliant server for REDCap at UNLV is expected to be approved and
accessible to faculty by [CONTACT_554769]/early May.  **update: As of 7/13/2023, UNLV ORI and OIT have
begun implementing REDCap for faculty research use with identifiable information.*
The only identifiable information collected as part of this study are participant name, date of
birth, email address, mailing address, audio recordings, and phone number.  These are stored in a
separate master list in a separate REDCap database, linked using participant Study ID number. 
The Forte/Advarra Research Payment System asks for participant identifiers (name, gender,
email, mailing address, and date of birth). These will be obtained by [CONTACT_554770]/Forte system.
Removal of the master list at study completion will render the final dataset deidentified and help
protect participant privacy and confidentiality of study records.
What procedure(s) will be utilized to prevent/minimize any potential risks?
We have developed procedures to minimize risk to our participants and to create conditions that
make study participation as comfortable as possible.
 To mitigate and address distress among our non-mental health specialist coach Coach participants :
participants, we have incorporated such issues into our training protocols. This is similar to our
standard training for Research Assistants in interacting with patient participants across studies
related to mental health. For example, we will discuss and role play how to sensitively inquire about
mood and symptoms of anxiety; how to respond to patient distress, including reassuring the patient
or facilitating contact [CONTACT_9436] [INVESTIGATOR_554731]; and how to manage one’s own emotions such as
concern, worry, anxiety, and possible distress over patients' conditions. 
Coaches are asked to read, acknowledge and sign a TREATment lab confidentiality agreement as
a condition of participation in order to protect patient participant and other coach participant
information, as well as to safeguard research documents in the lab space where sessions will be
conducted. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_554732]. Coaches will be
supervised by [CONTACT_978] (a licensed psychologist) on a weekly basis while carrying an active caseload
and will be able to contact [CONTACT_554771]. Weekly
supervision will involve discussion of ways in which coach participants can cope effectively with
patient distress. Supervision will include group supervision, in which coaches will present cases
identified only by [CONTACT_554772]. Such desire for group supervision was expressed by [CONTACT_554773]'s former trial of a similar nature (conducted at the University of
Washington; these experiences from student coaches were published in Woodard, Mraz, & Renn,
2023, BMC Psychiatry).
Research staff will always be present on campus and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554733]. In addition, as part of standard protocol the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554734], evening, and weekend if necessary via cell phone.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_554735] (attached risk of harm
protocol). The existing protocol the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554736]/coaches is as follows: If patients report any thoughts of committing suicide or
harming themselves, worsening of mental health symptoms, emergent manic or psychotic
symptoms, thoughts of homicide or harming others, or elder or child abuse/neglect during or outside
of STAR sessions, coaches immediately contact [CONTACT_978]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a risk assessment with
the patient participant and will arrange emergency psychiatric services, contact [CONTACT_554774], or place a
report to child or elder abuse services if indicated. Coaches only see patient participants during
hours when our research group in on campus; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554737].
The research team has agreed to abide by [CONTACT_554775]. Investigators will not share information regarding intervention fidelity with other
coaches or study staff.
 The following safeguards will be implemented to increase the safety of patient Patient participants :
participants:
(a) Clinical deterioration and suicide risk: We will attend to clinical deterioration for both participant
protection purposes, and in order to document the safety of the intervention. We define “clinical
deterioration” as 1) the development of passive or active suicidal ideation (as confirmed by
[CONTACT_431]) at any point during the study; 2) the development of manic or psychotic symptoms; or
3) 30% increase in PHQ-9 or GAD-7 scores at follow-up assessment. Rating scales may not>
adequately capture clinical deterioration in all patients. For this reason, we will encourage coaches
to report when they notice a worsening of clinical state that is not identified by [CONTACT_86950].
Any patient participant exhibiting 30% increase in GAD-7 scores for two consecutive sessions will>
trigger specific case-focused individual supervision with [CONTACT_554787], which may include specific
guidance on following sessions, outside recommendations, and/or direct contact [CONTACT_549495]. Renn with
the patient.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_554738], a patient participant may later (at
sessions 2-8) endorse item 9 on the PHQ (reporting having “Thoughts that you would be better off
dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself in some way?”). This is unlikely to happen but is possible. This
will be handled on a case-by-case basis and a positive answer endorsement to item 9 is not
necessarily indicative of active suicidality (e.g., there may be thoughts of death but not actually
wanting to die/kill oneself).  Any patient participant who endorses PHQ-9 item 9 (suicidal ideation)
will trigger the coach to conduct the C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale). Any
indication of moderate or high risk will trigger the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554739]. Also, any client
exhibiting 30% increase in PHQ-9 scores for two consecutive sessions will trigger specific>
case-focused individual supervision with [CONTACT_554787], which may include specific guidance on
following sessions, outside recommendations, and/or direct contact [CONTACT_549495]. Renn with the patient.
Patients with current suicidal ideation or a history of suicidal behavior will be ineligible to participate
in this study. Individuals who develop active suicidal ideation will be removed from the study and
referred to the crisis line, their PCP, and other relevant clinical services by [CONTACT_978]. Patients who
develop passive suicidal ideation or who evidence 30% increase in PHQ-9 or GAD-7 may be>
permitted to remain in the study and receive the intervention; they will also meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554740] (e.g., PCP, the UNLV PRACTICE, other
resources). Investigators will follow up to ensure this connection takes place. This may include
obtaining permission from the patient ppt for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554741]. Study research coordinators are
trained to assess manic and psychotic symptoms and will conduct follow up assessments.
In non-emergent cases of active ideation (e.g., nonspecific thoughts of wanting to kill oneself), the
patient participant will be allowed to continue with the day’s planned coaching session and any
scheduled assessments, as more information (e.g., from a clinical interview) may assist with better
understanding and documenting the worsening. If the patient participant does not continue with a
scheduled assessment because of PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], they will still receive payment for their next
scheduled assessment (either same-day or otherwise close in time; e.g., scheduled Week 8
assessment and PI [INVESTIGATOR_554742] 6 or 7 session).
b) Risk associated with intervention: The STARS program is a brief, structured behaviorally-based
mental health intervention that is based on and informed principles from cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT), a well-known and extensively researched treatment paradigm for depression and
anxiety. The PI [CONTACT_832] a licensed clinical psychologist, clinical supervisor, and graduate faculty instructor
with specialty in CBT and clinical trials conduct. To limit distress, research personnel and coaches
will be trained and supervised by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_554743]-generated concerns, stress, and anxiety.
(c) Risk associated with assessment: To minimize assessment-related burden, we will not use
redundant inquiries. The option to administer assessments over multiple meetings if needed will be
based on patient tolerance. The burden associated with research assessments will be described in
the informed consent, so that a patient may refuse to enroll in the protocol if he/she considers its
time commitments onerous. To limit distress, research personnel and coaches will be trained and
supervised by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_554744]-generated concerns,
stress, and anxiety.
(d) Risk associated with breach of confidentiality: To limit the possibility of such a breach of
confidentiality, coaches and research personnel will be trained in confidentiality and privacy. We will
instruct coaches that they must not reveal personal patient participant information to family or
friends, but only to the PI (clinical supervisor) and research staff as appropriate. We will counsel
coaches against having any type of “dual relationship” with study participants with whom they are
paired, such as a friendship. We will track dual relationships, breaches of confidentiality, and
adverse responses by [CONTACT_554776].

evaluation of psychopathology and an assessment of functional limitations for which
interventions are needed.2. Ongoing monitoring of clinical status and appropriate referral for
clinical care in the event of deterioration.3. Assignment to and receipt of a potentially active
intervention.

Privacy and Confidentiality
How will you protect the subjects privacy during research activities?
Privacy refers to the environment in which data are collected from participants and the
individual's interest in controlling the access of others to themselves (e.g., interviewing
participants individually in a place where personal responses will not be seen or
overheard, collecting only the minimum necessary PII to carry out the research, etc.).
All study staff have completed CITI training. Data will be collected and stored using a secure
online database accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554745]. The only
identifiable information we are requesting from both patient and coach participants is name, date of
birth, email address, mailing address, audio recording of sessions, and phone number; and the
Forte Research Payment System asks for participant identifiers (name, gender, email, mailing
address, and date of birth) for payment purposes. Coach participants will also participate in
video-recorded Zoom-based training sessions; however, role play demonstrations and other
interactive "breakout room" activities will not be recorded. These videos will focus on the
PI-delivered didactic training content. Nonetheless, they may contain identifiable information
including coach ppt faces, voices, and first names. These will be labeled simply as "STARS
training_Session 1_date" (and so forth for relevant training session numbers and dates) and stored
on the UNLV Google Drive lab folder accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554746].
These will be stored indefinitely for training purposes.
In-person assessment and intervention sessions will be conducted in TREATment lab space
(private rooms) on UNLV campus, where no other individuals have access to the space. Only the
coach and patient participant will be permitted to be in the room when intervention sessions are
taking place; likewise, only the assessor and patient ppt will be in the room during assessments.
Personal responses will not be seen or overheard by [CONTACT_554777]. Any virtual sessions (e.g.,
assessments) will be conducted from the same private TREATment lab space room on
UNLV campus. Coaches or assessors will ensure patient participants are conducting any virtual
sessions in a safe and private environment (e.g., bedroom in their residence). In the instance of any
virtual meetings, the researcher or coach will use the lab telephone or HIPAA-compliant Zoom
software for healthcare settings.  This version of Zoom adds safeguards, including (1) a unique
password to safeguard against unintended access from other individuals, and (2) a waiting room,
over which the TREATment lab host has control to only let authorized individuals into the meeting
room. 
The TREATment lab email is a university-sponsored email account ([EMAIL_10553]) and
is subject to 2-factor authentication (password entered by [CONTACT_554778], [CONTACT_554788], for verification on new devices). Only members of the TREATment lab have access to this
email. However, no email system is totally secure; as such, discretion will be handled in all
instances of email communication with participants. The lab email signature [INVESTIGATOR_32174] a
standard statement (e.g., used in mental health care treatment settings) that reads, “Please Note:
The information transmitted in this email is intended only for the person or entity to which it is
addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material. Any review, transmission,
dissemination or other use of or taking of any action in reliance upon, this information by [CONTACT_554779][INVESTIGATOR_554747]. If you receive this email in error, please
contact [CONTACT_554780].”
What precautions will be taken to safeguard  information and/or biological identifiable
specimens?
If identifiable data will be linked to the participant, describe how this will be presented in
any written or oral materials related to the study. 
If you plan to code the data, describe the method in which it will be coded and indicate
who will have access to the key to the code. 
If you plan to de-identify the data, describe who will be responsible for the
de-identification and how data will be de-identified so identifiers are not linked to the
participant data. 
Note: Data is considered to be anonymous when identifiable data is not collected at all.
If identifiers are obtained, but are replaced with pseudonyms or participant ID numbers
which can then be linked back to identifiers, then data is considered to be coded, not
anonymous. If the data cannot be linked back to identifiers, then data is considered to
be de-identified.
The Forte Research Payment System asks for participant identifiers (name, gender, email,
mailing address, and date of birth). Name, gender, email, date of birth, phone numbers, and
audio recordings will be collected for assessment and therapy purposes as well. Pending approval,
the plan is to  use HIPAA-compliant REDCap for study databases. All study materials will be labeled
with a participant ID number that is linked back to these identifiers.
Video recordings of coach training will likely contain identifiable information including coach ppt
faces, voices, and first names. These will be labeled simply as "STARS training_Session 1_date"
(and so forth for relevant training session numbers and dates) and stored on the UNLV Google
Drive lab folder accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_554746]. These will be stored
indefinitely for training purposes.

UNLV has entered into agreements with Google regarding the way they protect our
data. For HIPAA protected data, the core apps that allow storage of Protected Health
Information (PHI) are: Gmail, Google Drive (including Docs, Sheets, Slides, and
Forms), Google Calendar, Google Sites, and Google Apps Vault. For FERPA protected
data, the core apps that are compliant are: Gmail, Google Drive (including Docs,
Sheets, Slides, and Forms), Google Calendar, Google Sites, Google Classroom,
Google Contacts, Google Groups, Google Talk/Hangouts, and Google Vault.
UNLV REDCap is HIPAA compliant.  Contact [CONTACT_554781].
All study records, including audio recordings, will be stored in REDCap at UNLV. Video recordings of
coach trainings will be stored on the TREATment Lab UNLV Google Drive space.
Signed paper consent forms will be stored in a locked filing cabinet, in a locked room in the designated
TREATment lab space in a locked building accessible only to Psychology Dept researchers on UNLV
main campus.
Two separate databases will be created in REDCap: (1) a master list, linking participant Study ID numbers
with their identifiable information (i.e., name, email address, and phone numbers), and (2) the coded study
database, containing all study-related data. Study/lab research staff (including assessors, research
assistants) will have access to the master list, particularly for the purpose of scheduling study visits and
study-related contact. At the completion of the study (i.e., final participant visits and payments completed),
the master list will be deleted, rendering the study database deidentified. Deidentifed data will be kept
indefinitely.
Separate from PI [INVESTIGATOR_554748], the Forte/Advarra Research Payment System asks for participant
identifiers (name, gender, email, mailing address, and date of birth) for payment purposes. These will be
obtained from the study master list. Compensation records will be included in the coded study database
and linkable to the master list until the master list is deleted at study end.
Finally, patient participants will be given the option to be added to our TREATment lab participant registry
(UNLV IRB #1767333-EXP; approved 6-14-2021 through 06-13-2024). If they consent to this, their contact
[CONTACT_554782]. The
previously approved consent language has been added as an Addendum to the revised patient ppt
consent form (per the approved protocol for the lab registry).

How long will  and  information and/or biological specimens be kept? identifiable de-identified
Unless specified otherwise, all signed informed consents and other research related
documents (including but not limited to paperwork submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_1201])
should be retained throughout the study and for an additional three years after the study is
completed/closed with the IRB. HIPAA requires covered entities to maintain documentation
for six years.
Identifiable data obtained for payment will be kept only as long as required by [CONTACT_554783]/or UNLV Office of Human Subjects Compensation. Identifiable data inclusive of name, email address,
date of birth, mailing address, and phone numbers for this study will be destroyed as soon as the study is
complete. The exceptions are (1) audio recordings, which will be stored for up to 3 years in REDCap; and
(2) identifiable data in training video recordings, which will be kept for up to [ADDRESS_728574]. Deidentifed study data will be kept indefinitely.All
signed informed consents and other research related documents (including but not limited to paperwork
submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_1201]) will be retained throughout the study and for an additional three
years after the study is completed/closed with the IRB. Patient participants who elect to be added to our
TREATment Lab participant registry will be handled in accordance with that protocol (e.g., retention of
identifiers for contact [CONTACT_158874], with the option to remove oneself from the registry at any point).

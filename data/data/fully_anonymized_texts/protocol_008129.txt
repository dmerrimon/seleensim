WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH ? 
You are being invited to take part in a research  study about the effects of drugs on behavior. You 
are being asked to participate because you are [ADDRESS_861318] 21 years of age to participate in this 
research study and you will be asked to provide legal proof of age.  If you volunteer to take part in this 
study you will be one of  about 25  people to do so over the next two years at the University of 
Kentucky .  
WHO IS DOING THE STUDY?  
This study is being conducted under the scientific and administrative supervision of William W. 
Stoops, Ph.D., Department of Behavioral Sciences at th e University of Kentucky College of Medicine 
and the medical supervision of Lon R. Hays, MD, M.B.A. and Abner O. Rayapati, M.D.,  Department of 
Psychiatry , at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine.  There may be other people on the 
research team ass isting at different times.  
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
This medication development experiment is testing the effects of placebo (a blank , no drug) or n-
acetylcysteine (a medication used to treat acetaminophen overdose) on the subjective, cognitive and 
physiological effects of alcohol. We are also interested in determining whether n -acetylcysteine 
impacts whether you like alcohol and want to choose to drink it . The purpose of this research is to 
gather information on how safe n-acetylcysteine and ethanol are . The results of this study will be 
shared with the sponsor providing financial support for the study  (the National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism) , the Food and Drug Administration and other federal agencies, if required.  
You should und erstand that this is a research project, not a treatment program.  The procedures of 
the study are designed to provide scientific information in a way that is relatively safe and comfortable 
for you, but not to provide benefits.  If you are seeking treatment, do not agree to participate in 
the study.  This study will not help you stop using alcohol . The investigators can arrange for 
referral to an appropriate treatment program if you so desire.   
ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
You should not participate if you have a history of serious physical disease, current physical 
disease, impaired cardiovascular functioning like heart attack or stroke, high blood pressure, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_643657] , diabetes, current or past histories of 
serious psychiatric disorder. You should not participate if you have a history of other significant 
medical problems.  IRB Approval

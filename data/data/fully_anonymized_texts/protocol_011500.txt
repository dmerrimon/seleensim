COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  2  Objectives of the Clinical Investigation  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the endoscopic  removability of the stent 
component of the Evolution® Esophageal Stent System – Fully Covered (known as the 
Evolution® Esophageal fully covered stent) when used to treat patients with an obs truction 
caused by [CONTACT_383870]; refractory benign esophageal strictures; or 
esophageal fistulas, perforations, or leaks.  
 
The primary endpoint  will be the proportion of patients, of those patients in whom endoscopic 
retrieval is at tempted after an indwell time of between [ADDRESS_480372] successful 
stent removal (see Appendix C) of the Evolution® Esophageal fully covered stent.  Comparing 
the results of this primary endpoint (i.e., successful removal rate) to a performa nce goal based on 
literature will be the basis for the statistical analysis of the success of the study.  
2.[ADDRESS_480373] Description  
The Evolution® Esophageal fully covered stent is a flexible, self -expanding stent constructed of a 
single, woven, nitinol  wire ( Figure 2) .  Due to its design, the stent foreshortens as it expands.  It 
is fully covered . (both internally and externally) with a silicone membrane, with the exception of  
holes made in the apex of the cells at the proximal and distal ends through which the lasso loop 
passes.   To aid in visibility under fluoroscopy, there are four radiopaque marker bands at either 
end of the stent.  The stent has lassos, which include grasp ing features, at the proximal and distal 
ends of the stent that are used in stent repositioning and stent removal.  The total length of the 
stent is indicated by [CONTACT_383871]; the 
radiopaque markers indica te the actual stent length when expanded to nominal stent diameter.

It is also important to note that the decision to remove or reposition the stent is based on the 
physician’s clinical judgment.  Pre-existing conditions (e.g., stricture, fistula, perforation, leak) 
may not be healed at the time of stent removal and may require additional intervention.  
 
4.2 Methods to Minimize Risks  
This device will be used only by [CONTACT_383875] e experienced in endoscopic 
procedures.  Physicians who may remove the stent endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_383857]. Patients will be selected according to this study’s labeled indication and in 
accordance with the inclusion/exclusion crit eria outlined in this document.  There are no 
CLARITY – Evolution® Esophageal Stent System – Fully Covered  
MED Institute, Inc.   Page 14 of 40 
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ [ADDRESS_480376] of care procedures used to maintain 
patient comfort and speed recovery peri -procedurally.  
 
The device design, non -clinical testing, clinical study design , and manufacturer’s IFU are 
intended to minimize the risks associated with the use of this device.  The risks of the study have 
been minimized and the potential benefits outweigh the risks in light of the importance of the 
knowledge to be gained about the  removability of the device.  
5  Design of the Clinical Investigation  
5.1 Type of Investigation   
This prospective, multicenter, single -arm clinical investigation will evaluate the endoscopic 
removability of the Evolution® Esophageal fully covered stent in patients with esophageal 
obstruction caused by [CONTACT_383876]; refractory benign esophageal strictures; 
or esophageal fistulas, perforations, or leaks.  Cook believes a single -arm clinical study will 
provide the best valid scientific evidence of the ability to safely remove the stent.   
 
Patients will be enrolled at up to [ADDRESS_480377] 7 days, but no more than 6 months.  A patient can be enrolled in the study 
when the patient requires stenting for an obstruction caused by [CONTACT_383869]; refractory benign esophageal stri cture; or to seal an esophageal fistula, perforation, 
or leak.  Of the [ADDRESS_480378] 130 patients, additional enrollment will be requested.   Enrollment is 
expected to be completed within 24 months of initiating the study . 
 
Figure 1  (page 8) presents a flow diagram of the study design.  
 
5.2 Inclusion Criteria  
Patient enrollment shall be based on known information at the time of procedure.  It will not be 
considered a violation of the clinical investigation plan (CIP) if in formation obtained at a later 
date contradicts information collected at the time of procedure.  
 
CLARITY – Evolution® Esophageal Stent System – Fully Covered  
MED Institute, Inc.   Page 15 of 40 
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  Patient may be included if one of the following is met:  
• Diagnosed with a benign esophageal stricture with a history of at least 3 dilations and 
with the expectation of endoscopic stent removal or stent replacement approximately 
6-12 weeks after stent placement  
• Diagnosed with a malignant intrinsic or extrinsic esophageal obstruction (e.g., stricture) 
with the expectation of endoscopic stent removal or stent  replacement within 6 months 
after stent placement  
• Diagnosed with a benign esophageal fistula, perforation, or leak with the expectation of 
endoscopic stent removal or stent replacement approximately 6 -12 weeks after stent 
placement  
• Diagnosed with a malignant esophageal fistula, perforation, or leak with the expectation 
of endoscopic stent removal or stent replacement within 6 months after stent placement  
 
Note: Physicians will use their best estimate regarding expected time frames fo r endoscopic  stent 
removal or stent replacement when considering a patient for inclusion in the study.  Recognizing 
that several factors may affect the decision of if/when the stent will be removed or replaced, stent 
removal/replacement not performed or pe rformed outside of the expected time frames will not be 
considered a deviation from the clinical investigation plan.  
5.3 General Exclusion Criteria  
Patient will be excluded if any of the following are met:  
• Patient is < 18 years of age  
• Patient is unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent  
• Patient is unable or unwilling to comply with the follow -up schedule  
• Patient is pregnant, lactating, or planning on being pregnant within the next 6 months  
• Patient is simultaneously participating in another inv estigational drug or device study , or 
the patient has completed the follow -up phase for the primary endpoint of any previous 
study less than 30 days prior to enrollment in this study  
Note: Patients receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for malignancies  may 
participate in this study.  This includes treatment protocols with drugs or 
treatments cleared/approved for use in the country where the study is being 
conducted. The patient will not be permitted to enroll if also participating in a 
clinical study of  an investigational drug, device, or treatment (e.g., clinical study 
of a drug, device, or treatment not already cleared for use in the country where the 
study is being conducted).  If participating in a clinical study of an investigational 
drug, device, o r treatment, patient must be at least [ADDRESS_480379] their primary 
endpoint prior to enrollment in this study.

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  • Patient has any planned, significant, extra -esophageal surgical or interventional 
procedure within 30 days prior to or following the study procedure  
Note: Any procedure that is directly related to the indication for stenting should 
not be considered a reason for exclusion.   
• Patient that is contraindicated to upper GI endoscopy and/or any procedure to be 
performed in conjunction with esophagea l stent placement (e.g., patients in whom 
endoscopy procedures cannot safely be performed)  
• Patient has a medical condition or disorder that would limit life expectancy to less than 
the primary study endpoint or that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or 
confound the data analysis  
• Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to study products that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], cannot be adequately pre -medicated ; study products include  
nitinol (i.e., nickel, titanium) and sili cone  
• Patient is not a candidate for tumor reduction therapy or surgical resection  
Note: This criterion applies only to patients diagnosed with a malignant intrinsic 
or extrinsic esophageal obstruction, or with a malignant esophageal fistula, 
perforation, o r leak.  
5.4 Endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -confirmed Exclusion Criteria  
Patient will be excluded if any of the following are met:  
• Strictures that cannot be adequately dilated, if necessary, to allow passage of the delivery 
system   
• Stricture, fistula, perforation, or leak location that requires stent placement within 2 cm of 
cricopharynx  
• Stricture, fistula, perforation, or leak location that requires stent placement in an actively 
bleeding tumor  
• For placement of the stent, patient’s stricture is longer than 8 cm (i.e., req uires > 1 stent 
to fully cover with required oversizing)

successful removal (see Appendix C) of the Evolution® Esophageal fully covered stent.  
Comparing the results of this primary endpoint (i.e., successful removal rate) to a performance 
goal based on literature will be the basis for the statistical analysis of the success of the study.    
CLARITY – Evolution® Esophageal Stent System – Fully Covered  
MED Institute, Inc.   Page 17 of 40 
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  Of note, pati ents with successful study stent removal who require replacement with another non -
study stent will be considered a success within the study.  
5.5.2  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will include:  
• Technical success : a stent successfully delivered and placed at its intended location at the 
end of the procedure (note: adjustments made during the procedure are not considered a 
technical failure)  
• Clinical success   
o In patients with strictures: improvement or relief of dysphagia symptoms (Appendix C) 
at the [ADDRESS_480381] -stent follow -up 
o In patients with fistulas, perforations, or leaks: seal sufficient to enable oral intake at the 
7-day post -stent follow -up 
Note: Clinical success will be evaluated specifically in benign pat ients to assess 
effectiveness of the stent in benign indications.  
• Dysphagia requiring intervention  
• Incidence of procedural - and/or device -related adverse events  
• Incidence of stent removal -related adverse events within 30 days following stent removal 
(note:  perforations, tears, or fistulas present prior to stent placement will not be considered a 
stent removal -related adverse event if still present upon stent removal)  
• Device integrity during the stent removal procedure  
• Rate of successful stent removal versus  indwell time  
• Comparison of successful stent removal following implantation for benign indications 
compared to malignant indications  
• Incidence of stent migration over time (assessed, if clinically indicated, through visual 
assessment and/or imaging)  
o Note: Migration in patients receiving tumor reduction therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, 
radiation) may be analyzed separately from migration in the absence of treatment.  
Migration in patients receiving supplemental fixation at the initial implant procedure 
may be an alyzed separately from migration in the absence of supplemental fixation.  
 
These endpoints were chosen to supplement the primary endpoint . and were considered the most 
relevant to comprehensively support the safety and effectiveness of this device.  Second ary 
endpoints and additional data fields below will be analyzed for all patients, if applicable, 
including those without stent removal or stent removal at less than 7 days.

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  5.6 Variables to be Measured to Demonstrate Achievement of Endpoints  
The primary endpoint will evaluate endoscopic removability of the Evolution® Esophageal fully 
covered stent.  Specifically, the ability to completely remove the stent, incidence of tissue 
damage requiring immediate intervention, and hemorrhage requiring immedi ate intervention will 
be collected.  Information regarding adverse events will be collected throughout this study during 
clinical assessments or telephone contact [CONTACT_307123].  
 
Variables to assess secondary endpoints include the ability to deliver an d place the stent, 
dysphagia score (including dysphagia requiring intervention), incidence of procedural - and/or 
device -related adverse events, and incidence of stent removal -related adverse events.  
The clinical data will be collected on standardized case report forms.  The schedule for 
assessments is summarized in Table 2 (section 7.6).

6 months, to evaluate the primary hypothesis (section 6.1).  Patients may be enrolled at up to 
15 investigative sites, with no requirements regarding the maxi mum or minimum number of 
patients able to be enrolled at any given site.  The performance goal for the primary endpoint is 
based on a literature search that included removal rates following stent placement for both 
benign and malignant indications.1-28  It is important to note that, although the indications for 
stent placement varied (i.e., benign, malignant), the literature demonstrates that successful 
removal of the stent is independent of indication.  The nearly identical rates of successful stent 
remova l between stents placed for benign indications compared to malignant indications 
supports enrollment of patients with varied indications for stent placement within the current 
study.  
 
The rate of successful stent removal from literature was estimated to be  98%.1-28  With  a 
clinically relevant margin of 10%, a performance goal of the rate of successful removal of the 
stent was established to be 88%.  Fifty -eight (58) patients with attempted stent removal will be 
necessary to assess the primary hypothesis (section 6.1.1), u nder an expected rate of successful 
stent removal of 98%, with a one -sided exact binomial test, at a type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_480386]

The clinical success rate from literature was estimated to be 90% in patients with benign 
indications.29-31  With a clinically relevant margin of 10%, a performance goal of the clinical 
success rate was established to be 80%.  One hundred and seven (107) patients with benign 
indication will be necessary to assess the hypothesis (section 6.1.2), under an expected success 
rate of 90% at [ADDRESS_480388] too few patients to provide reasonable site -level estimates 
of primary, secondary, and baseline measures.  Pooling of this information will be explored 
based on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257760] (large versus small), site enrollment (large versus small), ty pe of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(community versus teaching), and other group -wise strategies.  
 
It is recognized that patient baseline characteristics may differ among sites, with some sites 
routinely treating patients with more severe disease progression.  It is anticipate d that the 
primary and secondary endpoint measures may be related to covariates that reflect this disease

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  progression, which are in turn related to outcome.  Thus, observed site -specific differences 
among the primary or secondary endpoints will be checked for confounding with other measured 
covariates (e.g., age, sex).  This can be accomplished using regression models (linear and logistic 
where appropriate) that include site and other measured covariates as independent variables.  
 
Should one or more sites b e found to differ significantly from the rest, then subsequent analyses 
may include the discriminating covariate or a covariate to distinguish between the unusual site(s) 
and those sites that are considered poolable.  
6.[ADDRESS_480389] 58 patients with attempted endoscopic  stent removal (see Appendix C for definition) 
after an indwell time of at least [ADDRESS_480390] stent removal attempted prior to exiting the study.  
Those additional patients will be followed until reaching a study endpoint; however, these 
patients will not be initially inclu ded in the hypothesis testing.  A secondary successful removal 
analysis, which will include only patients in whom removal is attempted specifically by [CONTACT_106244][INVESTIGATOR_383858], will be 
conducted. A hypothesis on clinical success will also be tested in patients with benign 
indications when enrollment is complete and at least [ADDRESS_480391] stent follow -up. 
 
Secondary endpoints may be analy zed separately and/or together for those patients with 
attempted stent removal compared to those patients without attempted stent removal. 
Additionally, a subgroup analysis will be conducted on patients who undergo stent removal due 
to a lack of effectiven ess (i.e., stent did not provide sufficient dysphagia relief or did not allow 
oral intake).  
 
Descriptive summaries will be provided where appropriate for each of the primary and secondary 
variables.   In general, summaries will be complete over the total po pulation.  Continuous 
variable summaries will include the number of subjects (N), mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
and maximum.  Categorical variable summaries will include the frequency and percentage of 
subjects who are in the particular category.  In general, the denominator for the percentage 
calculation will be based upon the total number of subjects with the measurement for the total 
population and by [CONTACT_1570], unless otherwise specified.

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  6.6 Limitations of the Investigation  
The study is limi ted by [CONTACT_383877], but allows for calculations of appropriate summary 
statistics.  There is also the possibility that patients will reach study completion of data collection 
prior to stent removal, due to one of the events described in Section 7 .10 (e.g., death, withdrawal, 
reached 6 months without stent removal).  These patients will not be included in the primary 
hypothesis testing.  
[ADDRESS_480392] 
data should include, but is not limited to, symptoms of the condition (e.g., pain, nausea), 
applicable past or current medical conditions, and patient’s dysphagia score.  Some 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., Endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -confirmed Exclusion Criteria)  may require 
evaluation immediately prior to stent placement to confirm eligibility into the study.  
7.[ADDRESS_480393] -procedural/discharge medication and therapy should be 
based upon clinical indication and underlying disease (i.e., standard of care).  Information 
regarding use of acid suppression therapy and tum or reduction therapy should be captured at 
baseline, discharge, and throughout follow -up. 
7.3 Stent Placement Procedure  
Please refer to the manufacturer’s IFU for stent and delivery system instructions, including 
general use information, patient preparatio n, procedural needs, wire guide use and selection, 
stent size selection, stent expansion/stent deployment, and delivery system removal.  Dilation 
should be completed, as necessary, to allow complete evaluation of the lesion prior to delivery of 
the stent.  Confirmation that the patient meets one applicable inclusion criterion, and none of the 
exclusion criteria (including General and Endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -confirmed Exclusion Criteria),  must be 
obtained prior to introduction of the stent.  The IFU recommends assess ment and pre -dilation of 
the stricture, as necessary , to a diameter at least equal to the diameter of the delivery system and 
a maximum of 11 mm.   Pre-dilation can occur over several sessions per the physician’s 
discretion prior to stent placement.  There is a lasso loop with a graspi[INVESTIGATOR_383859] – Evolution® Esophageal Stent System – Fully Covered

incorrect placement).  If clinically indicated, supplemental fixation may be used.  
 
At the time of the stenting procedure, the following information should be recorded, at a 
minimum:  
• Lesion characteristics  
• Stent information  
• Reason/indication for stent placement  
• Ability to deliver and accurately place the stent  
• Device integrity  
• Need for repositioning (note: repositioning within [ADDRESS_480394] the stent or ease of deployment as the stent 
is designed to allow for repositioning)  
• Adverse events (including seriou s events) occurring during the procedure  
7.4 Point of Enrollment  
Point of enrollment will be based on the intent -to-treat population, and is defined to include any 
patient for whom the treatment procedure is initiated.  More specifically, once the delivery  
system of the study device (Evolution® Esophageal Stent System – Fully Covered) has been 
inserted into the patient, this patient would be included in the intent -to-treat population.  Cook 
intends to enroll a maximum of [ADDRESS_480395] no fluids or foods by [CONTACT_383878] a successful seal (e .g., barium swallow).  It is recommended that patients be given clear 
liquids in an upright position during the first 24 hours.  After 24 hours, it is recommended that 
patients be instructed to chew food well or eat soft food and to drink fluids before and  after 
meals.

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  Patients with stents placed in the distal esophagus or across the gastroesophageal (GE) junction 
may be instructed to elevate the head of their bed, and may be prescribed acid suppression 
therapy to minimize gastric reflux into the stent.  
 
Patients should be discharged according to institutional standards.  At the time of discharge, 
information including, but not limited to clinical symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea) and adverse 
events (including serious events) occurring since the procedure shoul d be recorded.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_480396] -stent Placement  
Patients will be followed after stent placement according to the schedule below unless the stent is 
removed (surgically or endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]), a non -study stent is placed, or other study exit (e.g., 
death, wi thdrawal, lost to follow -up) has occurred:  
 Clinic visit  7 days  (range 5 -12 days)

   2 months ± 7 days  
   3 months ± 7 days  
   4 months ± 7 days  
   5 months ± 7 days  
   6 months ± 7 days  
 
If a patient completes a required visit outside of the prescribed follow -up window, it will be 
recorded as a deviation from the clinical investigation plan . 
 
Patients enrolled in the study will be followed an additional 30  days following endoscopic stent 
removal, unless replaced with another non -study stent.  If the study stent is surgically removed 
(e.g., during esophagectomy), the patient will immediately exit the study.  If a non -study stent is 
placed (either before or after stent removal), the patient w ill immediately exit the study  (note: 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_383860]).  If the stent removal procedure occurs at the 
6- month follow -up, patients will be followed an additional [ADDRESS_480397] the patient should be made and documented in the study source 
documents.  If the pat ient still cannot be reached it may be considered a missed visit/telephone

stent is removed surgically, patient will exit the study immediately.  If study stent is completely removed 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_383861], patient  will be followed for 30 days.  If stent is not completely removed 
and non -study stent is not placed, patient will be followed until patient reaches 6 -month follow -up or stent 
is completely removed.  
2 Additional endoscopy and/or radiographic assessment (e. g., X -ray) should be performed if clinically 
indicated (e.g., lack of marked improvement in dysphagia score, significant pain, suspected stent 
migration).  Additional X -rays may be warranted in patients at higher risk for migration.  
3 If stent placed for f istula, perforation, or leak, radiographic assessment (e.g., barium swallow) should be 
performed to confirm successful sealing of the lesion after stent implantation and to confirm lesion 
closure following stent removal.  
4 Patient will be requested to prov ide information regarding clinical symptoms (e.g., dysphagia) and 
adverse event information since the last contact, if applicable, during each telephone contact [CONTACT_383879]’s study participation.  Adverse events should also be rep orted upon awareness of 
the event if between telephone contacts and clinical visits.  
 
For patients with a fistula, perforation, or leak, documentation of the original lesion closure 
should be obtained following stent removal (e.g., barium swallow), even if  the original lesion is 
not identified using endoscopy at stent removal.

keep the sponsor informed of such IRB approval and subsequent IRB actions 
concerning the investigation;  
• The importance of access to an adequate number of suitable subjects to conduct t he 
investigation;  
• The importance of adequate facilities for conducting the clinical investigation; and  
• The importance of sufficient time from other obligations to carry out the 
responsibilities to which the investigator is committed by [CONTACT_383890]. 
 
E. During the course of  the investigation, at the direction of the Project Manager, the 
monitor should visit the site frequently enough to ensure that:  
• The facilities and research staff used by [CONTACT_383891] ; 
• The applicable version of the CIP and agreements are being followed;  
• Changes to the CIP, informed consent/patient information have been approved by 
[CONTACT_4158]/or reported to the sponsor and the IRB;  
• Accurate, complete, and current records are being main tained;  
• Accurate, complete, and timely reports are being made to the sponsor and IRB; and  
• The investigator is carrying out the agreed -upon activities and has not delegated 
them to other previously unspecified staff.  
As appropriate, the following tasks coul d be performed during periodic visits:  
• Device/product accountability review;  
• Adverse event review to ensure that events are appropriately reported within the time 
periods required by [CONTACT_456], CIP, IRB, and applicable regulatory requirements; 
and 
• Source data verification per the monitoring plan to determine that:  
o Informed consent/patient information has been documented in accordance with 
applicable regulations and expectations of the local IRB;  
o The information recorded in the case  report forms (paper or electronic) is 
complete, accurate, and legible;  
o There are no omissions in the CRFs of specific data elements, such as the 
administration to any patient of concomitant test articles or the development of 
an intercurrent illness;

o Subjects failing to complete the clinical investigation and the reason for each 
failure are noted.  
 
F. Records of the monitor.  
The monitor shall prepare and maintain records of each initiation visit and each pe riodic 
visit, general site contact, or discussion.  These will include:  
1. Date, name, and address of the investigator, and names of other staff members 
present at each meeting.  
2. A summary of the findings of the visit.  
3. A statement of any action taken by [CONTACT_383892].

Definitions  
Attempted stent removal/retrieval: an endoscopic procedure in which one of the following 
occurs:  
1) Removal is attempted by [CONTACT_106244][INVESTIGATOR_383868], or  
2) Removal is intended, but the subject is not considered to be a candidate for safe 
endoscopic stent removal (i.e. endoscopic removal is felt to be not possible or not safe)  
 
Clinical success, for patients with obstruction caused by [CONTACT_383893] a refractory benign esophageal stricture : improvement or relief 
of dysphagia symptoms at the [ADDRESS_480414] -stent follow -up 
 
Clinical success, for patients with a fistula, perforation, or leak : seal sufficient to enable oral 
intake at the 7-day post -stent follow -up 
 
Dysphagia score :32  
  0 = able to eat a normal diet  
  1 = able to eat some solid food  
  2 = able to eat some semi -solid food only  
  3 = able to swallow liquids only  
  4 = inability to tolerate any oral intake  
Significant dysphag ia ≥ 2  
 
Dysphagia, improvement : a decrease in the dysphagia score by [CONTACT_2669] 2  
 
Dysphagia, relief:  complete relief of dysphagia (i.e., dysphagia score of 0)  
 
Stent migration : migration of the stent such that it is no longer covering treated lesion   
 
Stent removal -related adverse events : an adverse event directly related to the endoscopic 
removal of the stent.  These events include esophageal perforation, esophageal tears, an d 
esophageal bleeding requiring immediate intervention.  If these conditions were present prior to 
stent placement, any worsening due to stent removal would be considered related to the removal 
procedure.  However, an adverse event identified during the re moval procedure that was not 
caused specifically by [CONTACT_383894].  For example, an ulceration 
or perforation that arose during implantation would not be considered as associated with

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  CIP 11 -012-04 ∙ 11 November 2013  removal.  Also, events caused by [CONTACT_383895] a method of supplemental fixation 
will not be considered related to stent removal.  
 
Successful stent removal : one in which the Evolution® Esophageal fully covered stent  
1) Is completely removed from the patient during a single endoscopic  procedure with the 
wire mesh integrity maintained such that the stent can be removed in one contiguous 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], and  
2) Has no tissue damage or hemorrhage visible during the retrieval procedure that is both:  
a. Related to endoscopic  stent removal and  
b. Requires immediate treatment  
Of note, patients with successful endoscopic  study stent removal who require replacement with 
another non -study stent will be considered a success within the study.  Stents that are removed 
surgically (e.g., during esophagectomy) will not be evaluated for successful stent removal.  Stent 
damage or tissue damage or hemorrhage that results from supplemental fixation will not count 
against successful stent removal and will be reported separately.  
 
Technical succe ss: a stent successfully delivered and placed at its intended location at the end of 
the procedure  (note: adjustments made during the procedure are not considered a technical 
failure)

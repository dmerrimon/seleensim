Study Centers:  10  Number of Subjects:  150 randomized  
Study Period:  12 weeks  Clinical Phase: Phase 2   
Objective:  
The objective s of this study are  to determine the safety and local tolerability of DFD -03 
(tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%  and to compare it with Tazorac (tazarotene)  Cream,  0.1% in the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_258189] 12 weeks . 
Methods:   
This will be a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, active -controlled study .  
Subjects with  mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be randomized to treatment with either 
DFD -03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%, Tazorac (tazarotene) Cream, 0.1%, Vehicle Lotion  or 
Vehicle Cream in a ratio of 2:2:1:1 . Upon randomization, the treatment group (DFD -03 group or 
Tazorac group) will be known but the treatment assignment (active vs. vehicle) within that 
treatment group will remain blinded.  During the 12- week treatment period subjects randomized 
to DFD -03 Lotion or Vehicle Lotion will use the study drug tw ice daily with approximately 
12 hours between applications. Subjects randomized to Tazorac Cream or Vehicle Cream will use the study drug once daily in the evening. Subjects will be instructed to treat the entire face.    
At selected site( s), subjects with a cne lesions of any severity on the chest and/or back (including 
shoulders) may be enrolled provided they have met all inclusion criteria including mild to moderate acne on the face and have not met any exclusion criteria and will treat all areas affected w ith acne on the face, chest and/or back, including shoulders, if applicable .  Up to  [ADDRESS_313621] and/or back including shoulders will be randomized to treatment with either DFD -03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%, Tazorac (t azarotene) 
Cream, 0.1%, Vehicle Lotion  or Vehicle Cream in a ratio of 2:2:1:1. 
At selected site( s), subjects who are 9 to 11 years of age will be randomized to DFD -03 group 
only in a 1:1 ratio of DFD -03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1% to Vehicle Lotion.  Approxim ately 8 
subjects will be enrolled in this age range and the inclusion criteria on the number of  
inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesions will not be applicable to these subjects .

Safety assessments will include the i nvestigator’s assessment of local cutan eous 
tolerance/ application site reactions on the face ( dryness , non -lesional erythema, peeling, 
stinging, burning, and itching ), vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), and adverse events 
(AEs). Local cutaneous tolerance  reactions on the chest and/or back including shoulders (if 
applicable) , will be assessed separately. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at Screening, 
Baseline and at every visit through Week  12 for all female subjects. A physical examination will 
be performed at the Baseline and a t the End of Study Visit.   
The Cardiff Acne Disability Index  (CADI) will be used to assess the quality of life in all 
subjects at Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 4, 8 and 12.  
The i nvestigator will assess efficacy by [CONTACT_112948] ’s Global Assessment  scale (IGA 
5-point  scale) and by [CONTACT_112949] -inflammatory  lesions on the 
face at Baseline and  Weeks 4, 8, and 12.

Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety criteria:  
Safety variables include local tolerability/ application site reaction occurrence and adverse 
events. Comparison of local tolerability and safety of DFD -03 Lotion with Tazorac  Cream will 
be the primary endpoint for this study.  
Local tolerability/a pplicatio n site reactions  include dryness , non- lesional erythema, peeling, 
stinging/burning, and pruritus  and will be assessed at each study visit from Baseline through End 
of Study . The reactions on the face will be assessed separately from those on the chest and/ or 
back, including shoulders (if applicable). Other s afety variables include physical examination 
and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) .   
Efficacy criteria:  
The following efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics for both the ITT 
and PP populations. 
• The IGA success rate at Week 12 (an IGA score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at 
least a 2 -grade reduction from baseline)  
• Absolute change from baseline in inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion counts on 
the face at  the Week 12 visit.  
• Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts on the face  
• Change from Baseline to Week 12 in CADI

1 INTRODUCTION 
Tazarotene, an acetylenic retinoid, is a prodrug that undergoes rapid and complete metabolism 
to its active metabolite tazarotenic acid ( Chandraratna, 1996). Retinoids are a class of 
keratolytic drugs derived from retinoic acid used for the treatment of acne and psoriasis. Several synthetic retinoids have been developed for topi[INVESTIGATOR_112929].  
Tazarotene was initially developed in gel formulation and subsequently in cream and foam formulations. Products containing tazarotene have been proven to be effective  in the treatment 
of acne vulgaris and psoriasis, as well as being effective in the mitigation (palliation) of facial fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper - and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and benign facial lentigines.  
[CONTACT_23015]’ s Laboratories has developed DFD -03 Lotion, a new formulation containing 0.1% 
tazarotene for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_112930]. This new product is intended to be used as a face wash twice daily. Treatment use will begin by [CONTACT_2931] a generous amount of product to moistened affected skin, rubbing until foamy, and then rinsing with water after 1 minute.  
Acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodular cystic lesions) and non- inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) ( Shalita, 
2004). The four primary factors contributing to acne are abnormal follicular epi[INVESTIGATOR_112931], hyperactivity of the sebaceous glands, proliferation of Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] , 
and perifollicular inflammation.  
Current ly available treatments for acne vulgaris include oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112932], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112933], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112934], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112935], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112936], oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22775] (including tazarotene), and phototherapy.  
Tazarotene is a well -characterized active ingredient, and many studies have been conducted on 
its pharmacology, toxicology and clinical efficacy and safety  (Fabior Prescribing Information, 
Tazorac Cream Prescribing Information ). 
Tazarotene is characterized by [CONTACT_4760] a Category X drug, indicating that it may or can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant  (Menter, 2000 ). At least [ADDRESS_313641] become 
pregnant during clinical studies with tazarotene and all reported the birth of healthy babies, although the timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation time are unknown in these 
cases .  
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and local tolerability of DFD- 03 Lotion 0.1% 
compared to Tazorac (tazarotene) Cream, 0.1% Cream  for topi[INVESTIGATOR_258190] 
12 weeks.

2:2:1:1 ratio  to treatment with DFD -03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%, Tazorac (tazarotene) Cream,  
0.1% , Vehicle Lotion, or Vehicle Cream .  During the 12- week treatment period subjects 
randomized to DFD -03 Lotion or Vehicle Lotion will use the study drug tw ice daily with 
approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects randomized to Tazorac Cream or 
Vehicle Cream will use the study drug once daily in the evening.   
At selected site (s), subjects with acne lesions of any severity on the chest and/or back (including 
shoulders) may be enrolled provided they have met all inclusion criteria including mild to 
moderate acne on the face and have not met any exclusion criter ia and will treat all areas 
affected with acne on the face, chest and/or back, including shoulders, if applicable.  Up to [ADDRESS_313647] and/or back including shoulders will be randomized to treatment with either DFD -03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%, Tazorac (tazarotene) 
Cream, 0.1%, Vehicle Lotion  or Vehicle Cream in a ratio of 2:2:1:1. 
Also, there will be  selected site (s) that will enroll approximately 8 subjects who are 9 years of 
age to 11 years of age.  They will be randomized to DFD -03 group only in a 1:1 ratio of DFD -
03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1% to Vehicle Lotion. The total number of approximately [ADDRESS_313648] and/or back, and 
approximately  8 subjects in the age group of 9 -11 years.  
Safety variables include local tolerability/ application site reaction occurrence and treatment - 
emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) . The primary safety endpoint will be  the comparison of local 
tolerability /application site reactions  and safety of DFD -03 Lotion with Tazorac Cream . Local 
tolerability/a pplication site reactions  include dryness , non- lesional erythema, peeling, 
stinging/burning, and pruritus  and will be assessed (separately for the face and the chest and/or 
back)  at each study visit from Baseline through End of Study . Other s afety variables include vital 
signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) . A physical examination will be performed at Baseline  and 
at the E nd of S tudy Visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed  at Screening, Baseline and at 
every visit through Week 12 for all female subjects.  
The i nvestigator will assess efficacy by [CONTACT_112948] ’s Global Assessment scale (IGA , 
5-point scale) and by [CONTACT_112949] -inflammator y lesions on the 
face at Screening, Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Lesion counts will also be done separately 
for the chest and/or back (including shoulders), where applicable  for those selected site( s). 
The Cardiff Acne Disability Index  (CADI) will be used to assess the quality of life in all 
subjects at Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 4, [ADDRESS_313649] (or legal guardian) must be willing to authorize use and disclosure of protected 
health information collected for the study.  
3. Subject must be a t least 12 years of age.

it is weighed.  Additional bottles /tubes  should be dispensed as needed. The  investigator will also 
ask about compliance with protocol requirements . Protocol deviations will be reco rded in the 
subject’s chart  and Protocol Deviation Form  and included in the study report . A Protocol  
Deviation Form  is not needed for missed visits, missed applications, out -of-window visits , or 
missing data. These items will be apparen t from the missing data on the eCRF and will be 
identified programmatically during data analysis for purposes of reporting. The s ponsor should 
be consulted before discontinuing subjects due  to protocol deviations unless safety is a concern.  
In addition, subjects will be provided a diary card for documenting the time and dates of  
application s. The subjects will review the diary card with the investigator or designee at each 
visit. The number of applied and missed applic ations will be recorded on the e CRF.  A subject 
will be considered compl iant if the subject applied at least 80% but no more than 120% of the 
expected applications during the entire evaluation period. 
 
6.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be assigned randomly to  one of the four treatment arms, DFD -03 (tazarotene) 
Lotion 0.1%, Tazorac (tazarotene) Cream, 0.1%, Vehicle Lotion  or Vehicle Cream  in a 2:2:1:1 
ratio (50 subjects each to DFD -03 Lotion and Tazorac Cream , and 25 subjects each to  Vehicle 
Lotion and Vehicle Cream) . A treatment assignment  schedule will be created with kit numbers 
randomly assigned to study products . The  date and time of randomization and the bottle /tube  
number should be entered on the e CRF.  
For the selected site (s) enrolling s ubjects in the 9- 11 age group, subjects  will be  assigned 
randomly to one of the two treatment arms, DFD -03 (tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%, and 0.1%, 
Vehicle Lotion  in a 1:1 ratio (4 subjects each to DFD -03 Lotion and Vehicle Lotion). A 
treatment assignment  schedule will be created with kit numbers randomly a ssigned to study 
products , which is independent from the treatment assignment schedule created for ages 12 and 
older . 
For the selected site( s) enrolling subjects with acne involvement on the face, chest and/or back 
including shoulders, subjects will be ass igned randomly to treatment with either DFD -03 
(tazarotene) Lotion 0.1%, Tazorac (tazarotene) Cream, 0.1%, Vehicle Lotion  or Vehicle Cream 
in a 2:2:1:[ADDRESS_313670] and/or back and 
shoulders, the subject kit size will contain more study medication for application.  A treatment assignment  schedule will be created for these larger kit sizes with kit numbers random ly

6.5.2 Unblinding  
The blind should be broken for all SAE IND safety reports that are judged to be  expedited 
reports for submission to FDA. The unblinding procedures and follow -up will be performed in 
accordance with the protocol and the CRO ’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). The blind 
should not be broken at the study site level except in a medical emergency  (where knowledge of 
the study medication received would affect the treatment of the  emergency). For a medical 
emergency, the blind must only be broken following  discussion on a case -by-case basis, at the 
discretion of the Investigator/treating  physician/Sponsor. 
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the subject’s  source record, 
eCRF, and any associated AE report.  If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, 
or subject  is unblinded, the  unblinding incident and unblinded subject  must be listed as a major 
protocol deviation. A subject  for whom the blind is broken wi ll discontinue study medication  
and be  scheduled for a safety follow -up visit and then discontinued from the study. The subject  
will be encouraged to stay in the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized. All Investigators 
and the IRB will receive blinded reports. However, on the request of  the IRB, the Sponsor will 
send unblinded reports directly to the IRB.

7.2 Screening  
A separate Screening Visit (Visit 1) may be performed when a wash out period is required or for 
scheduling purposes . Alternatively, Visits  1 and 2 may be combined if no washout period is 
required . The screening number, date of visit, date of consent, reason for screen failure, and 
study status  (screen failure)  will be captured in the  eCRF  for every screen failure subject.  The

7.5.1 Investigator’s  Global Assessment ( IGA) of the Face  
The IGA scale to be used in the study is a measure of static evaluation of qualitative overall 
acne severity. IGA is an ordinal scale with five  severity grades (rep orted only in integers, e.g., 
0 to 4). Each grade is defined by a distinct and clinically relevant morphologic description to minimize inter -observer variability  (Table 4) . The grades on the scale have been sufficiently 
defined to appropriate ly and unambiguously represent each severit y grade on the scale. The 
investigator is required to perform IGA scoring at each visit. The IGA should always be done prior to lesion counts.  
Table  4: IGA Scale f or Facial Acne Vulgaris  
Grade  Description  
[ADDRESS_313678] clear; rare non -inflammatory lesions with no more than rare 
papules  
2 Mild severity; some non -inflammatory lesions with no more than a few 
inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions)  
3 Moderate severity; up to many non -inflammatory lesions and may have 
some inflammatory lesions, but no more than one small nodular lesion 
4 Severe; up to many non -inflammatory and inflammatory lesions, but no 
more than a few nodular lesions  
 
7.5.2 Lesion Counts  of the Face  
Non-inflammatory  lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts) on the face  (above the 
mandibular line), including the nose, will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from 
Screening/ Baseline through Week 12. Non -inflammatory  lesions of acne are the open 
(blackheads) or closed (whiteheads) comedones. Closed comedones may be more difficult to detect  visually and may require stretching of the skin to aid in visualization. Inflammatory 
lesions are divided into papules, pustules, and nodules/nodulocystic lesions, depending on the severity and location of the inflammation within the dermis. Nodulocystic lesions will be 
counted separately from inflammatory lesions of papules and pustules. The papules and pustules have surrounding halos of erythema allowing for their characterization as inflammatory. Nodules are typi[INVESTIGATOR_112942]/or painful. Additionally, they are deep-seated in the skin (i.e., centered in the dermis or subcutis). Nodules have been defined as being greater than 5  mm in diameter. The borders of these lesions may be difficult to determine 
because of the associated ery thema/inflammation. The investigator/evaluator should use 
standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure consistent and accurate counts.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313679] and/or Back (including shoulders)  
At selected s ite(s), for subjects who have acne lesions on their chest and/or back ( including  
shoulders), lesion counts will be assessed separately for these areas.  
Non-inflammatory lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions (nodules and cysts) on the chest and/or back 
including shoulders (if applicable) will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from Baseline through Week 12. Nodulocystic lesions will be counted separately from i nflammatory 
lesions of papules and pustules. The back area is from most prominent cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_258192]. The chest area is from the manubrium of the sternum superiorly to the xiphiod process inferiorly. The lesion types are as described above. The investigator/evaluator should use standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure consistent and accurate counts. 
 
7.5.4 Cardiff Acne Disability Index  (CADI)  
The CADI is a short [ADDRESS_313680] s of 5 questions. The scor ing for each question is done from 0 to 3 (a=3, b=2, c=1, d=0) . 
The CADI score is calculated by [CONTACT_37303] a possible maximum of 15 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired.    
 The CADI questionnaire is provided in Appendix 2. 
 
7.6 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments include vital signs, local cutaneous tolerance evaluation of the treated skin, 
and AEs . Vital signs (blood pressure  and pulse) will be collected at each visit. A physical 
examination will be performed at Baseline (Day 1)  and at Week 12 . Urine pregnancy tests for 
all female subjects (regardless of childbearing potential)  will be conducted at Screening and 
Baseline (Day  1) and at each subsequent visit. Adverse events will be collected by [CONTACT_258200] ( either verbal or recorded in the subject diary ), by [CONTACT_258201] , and by [CONTACT_4171] (see Section  8 for det ails about AEs). Adverse events, whether 
believed by [CONTACT_258202], will be recorded on the eCRF . 
At Visits 2 through 5 the investigator will assess local cutaneous tolerance by [CONTACT_112972]- lesional erythema, peeling , and dryness  that will be graded as 
shown below ( Table 5 , Table 6 , Table 7 ) and recorded on the e CRF . Assessments will be  
recorded separately for the face and (if applicable) chest and/or back (including shoulders)  for 
selected site( s). The investigator will also ask the subject if any stinging ( Table 8 ), burning 
(Table 9) , or itching  (Table 10) has occurred on the face  and chest and/or back (including 
shoulders), if applicable since the last visit (for Visit [ADDRESS_313681] 2 weeks ). Visit [ADDRESS_313682] and/or back (including shoulders) , if

[ADDRESS_313699] common frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical trials with tazarotene 
cream 0.1% for the treatment of acn e were desquamation, dry skin, erythem a, and burning 
sensation , occurring in 10% to 30% of subjects. Adverse reactions occurring in 1%  to 5% of 
treated subject s included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging .  
The investigator is to pay special attention at each visit to any signs  of clinically significant 
dryness, non- lesional erythema , and peeling and report  as an AE  subsequent to the Baseline 
Visit if worse than at Baseline. 
An AE  is any untoward medical occu rrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. The 
event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study product . An AE  can 
therefore be any sign, symptom, or disease, or any worsening of an existing sign, symptom, or 
disease, whether or not considered related to the study product  or trial procedures, including 
injuries.   
Any medical condition that is present at the time of Screening or Baseline should be considered 
as medical history and reported on the medical history e CRF  and should not be reported as an 
AE except for AEs  observed at the Baseline V isit due to study procedures performed at the 
Screening visit , which should be reported. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing 
conditions should not be reported as A Es. Unexpected worsening of pre -existing conditions 
should be reported as AEs . The disease or condition being studied or expected progression,

Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs (except at Visits 1 & 2) should be reported as AEs if they are considered to be 
clinically significant, as per the Investigator’s judgment.  
 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Severity  
It is the investigator's responsibility to assess the severity of each AE . Descriptions of severity 
are as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.0  
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-008 
Page  40 of 53 
1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
 
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
 3. Severe
:  Incapacitating such that  normal activity is prevented. Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_313702]  (Causality)  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the study pr oduct  and the 
AE. The degree of “ relatedness” of the AE  to the study product  should be described using the 
following categories:  
1. Not Related
: The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.). Specify if known. Or, the event is most probably  produced by [CONTACT_11259] ’s clinical state, therapeutic interv entions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
2. Possibly Related : The event is temporally related to  study product  use but can be 
explained by [CONTACT_11693]. Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
3. Probably Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
4. Definitely Related : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_1605] ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention , or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs immediately  
following study  product administration or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112945], or there is a 
positive reaction  at the application site.  
 
8.3.3 Seriousness  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an AE. A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is any AE  occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening (subject at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, a re not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  
of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313703] be faxed or emailed  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The 
minimum initial information required to be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Form is: the 
subject number, subject init ials, the event, the causality, the date of the event , and the name [CONTACT_112990]. This initial report should be promptly followed up with a 
completed  Serious Adverse Event Form.

The initial information must include a causality assessment that is provided by [CONTACT_258204]. The causality assessment can be amended as more information is available . Significant new information about  ongoing SAEs should be 
reported promptly to the s ponsor. 
Serious adverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_941] m edical m onitor within 24 hours of receipt and 
plans for management and further reporting (i.e., FDA) determined.  
It is the responsibility of the CRO, Symbio LLC, to promptly notify the IRB and other Investigators involved in this study about serious and unexpected SAEs for which there is a 
reasonable possibilit y of their being related to the investigational product.  
Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events  
All follow -up reports will be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial Reports. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE  form, along with any 
supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or  autopsy reports), should be faxed 
or emailed to the Sponsor.

8.6 Exposure in utero  (Pregnancy)  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product  must  be discontinued 
immediately and she must  be followed through the pregnancy and delivery . The investigator 
should report the event to the s ponsor immediately (s ee contact [CONTACT_112975]) and 
complete the Pregnancy Report  Form.  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end 
of the pregnancy should be included in this information. The investigator is instructed to contact 
 
 
 
 
 
[CONTACT_15261] 2.[ADDRESS_313705] every 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and repo rt the outcome to the sponsor. 
Details of the pregn ancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy 
Report  Form.  
The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for SAEs  and should be reported as 
such: delivery complications prolonging hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, death 
of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried fetus.

PHI.  
• Expi[INVESTIGATOR_258193] a subject revokes authorization to collect and use PHI, the inve stigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to th e revocation of authorization. For subjects 
who have revoked authorization to collect and use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain  
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. , that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_313707] keep accurate separate records (other than e CRF s) of all subject visits that  
include all pertinent study -related information , including original signed/dated informed 
consent/assent forms. Source documents for this study include all w ritten records of study data. 
All study data must have a paper source document , including investigator assessments.   
 9.3 Screening/Enrollment Log  
A subject Screening/Enrollment Log, noting reasons for screen failure where applicable, must 
be maintained for all subjects who are consented. The log should also include subject initials, 
screening date, subject number , and date of enrollment , which is when ICF is signed , where 
applicable.   
 9.4 Case Report Forms  
Database set -up will be performed by [CONTACT_112977] e lectronic data c apture 
(EDC) vendor, using an appropriate fully validated, [ADDRESS_313708] will be recorded by [CONTACT_112978] e CRF . Only authorized site 
personnel will be able to enter/modify/correct data to the e CRF . 
Approved staff at Symbio will verify all data entered into e CRF s for completeness and accuracy 
with reference to the source documents and records and will issue manual data queries to correct 
missing data or discrepancies found against the source within the E DC system.  
Data validation will consist of automated and manual edit checks that are created directly into the EDC. Automated edit checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by [CONTACT_258205]. Study metrics will b e reported from the EDC system.  
After all data have been verified by [CONTACT_112979], an i nvestigator or s ub-investigator 
(listed on Form FDA 1572) is required to review and approve all e CRF s prior to database lock 
and breaking of the blind.  
After database lock, each site will receive the eCRF  data for their site  in an electronic format  for 
local archival purposes.  
Quality assurance verification via a 10% database audit of e CRF  data will be conducted before 
database lock and before the treatment assignment code is broken.

familiar with the etiology and signs and symptoms of acne and the treatment options that are 
currently avai lable.   
Before study initiation, the investigator and site personnel will receive protocol training from the sponsor’s representatives to ensure collection of accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable data. This training will take place either at a web -based Investig ator Meeting or individually 
on-site. 
During the course of the study, a monitor will make multiple site visits to check the progress of the study, review consent forms, review protocol compliance, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to the protocol and GCP. Any review of the subjects’ original medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained. The investigator will ensure that the monitor or other compliance auditor is given access to all study -related documents and has adequate time and space to 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313711] the monitoring visit including availability of the investigator and site personnel to 
discuss findings. 
Data capture methods will be designed to ensure accurate transfer of data to electronic media.  
The sponsor’s Quality Assurance representative may conduct QA audits randomly or if needed 
at 5% to 10% of the investigator sites.  
 
11 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be performed  using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Efficacy 
analyses will be performed using both the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and the per -protocol 
(PP) population. Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population (all subjects  who 
receive study product  and provide any post -baseline safety information ). Study populations are 
defined in S ection  11.2. 
A Statistical Analysis Plan, describing all statistical analyses, will be provided as a separate 
document prior to database lock and unblinding of the study treatments.  
11.1 Sample Size  
The sample size is not powered to obtain statistical significance, but is expected to provide an 
estimate on comparability of local tolerability/safety of DFD -[ADDRESS_313712] -
baseline safety information will be included in the safety population. No imputati on will be 
made for missing safety data.  
 11.2.2 Intent -to-Treat  
The ITT population consists of all subjects who are randomized and dispensed study 
medication.  11.2.3 Per-Protocol  
The PP population will include all subjects in the ITT population who complete the Week 12 
evaluation without any major protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy).  
Specifically, the PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who meet all of the following criteria: 
1. Subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
2. Subject did not take any prohibited concomitant medications during the evaluation period. The concomitant medication usage will be reviewed during the population determination review, remaining blinded to treatment designation, to determine 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313713] 80% but no more than 120% of the expected 
applications during the entire evaluation period.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to documented lack of efficacy, worsening condition, or a treatment -related AE will be included in the PP population.  
Other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommo date for unforeseen events that 
occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. These criteria will be documented with appropriate signature [CONTACT_258209], prior to database lock.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_313714] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_112980], Sa fety, and PP populations.  
 11.4 Efficacy Analyses   
The following efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics  for both the ITT 
and PP populations . 
• The IGA success rate at Week 12 (an IGA score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at 
least a 2-grade reduction from baseline)  
• Absolute change from baseline in inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion counts on 
the face at the Week 12 visit.  
• Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts on the face  
• Change from Baseline to Week 12 in CADI  
For missing IGA and lesion counts in the ITT population, t he primary handling method will be  
the multiple imputation (MI) approach via regression. In details, t he MI regression model will 
include the following predictors in the model: treatment, age, gender, baseline inflammatory 
lesion counts, baseline non- inflammatory lesion counts, and the results of the same variable 
from previous visits. The average score of the MI copi[INVESTIGATOR_258194].  
Note that if a subject withdraws early from the study, his efficacy assessments captured at the early termination visit will be assigned to the nearest corresponding scheduled visit that has been missed.
 
For the PP population, number of subjects who are discontinued prematurely due to documented lack of efficacy, worsening condition, or a treatment -related AE is expected to be small. For 
these subjects the efficacy data from their termination visit will be 
assigned to the nearest 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313715] 80% but no more than 120% of the expected 
applications for the re spective evaluation period. The total number of applications will be taken 
from the subject diaries . The number and percentage of subjects who use study product for less 
than 28 days, 28 to 56 days, 57 to 84 days and more than 84 days will be summarized.  
 
11.5.2 Local Cutaneous Safety Evaluation  
Non-lesional erythema, peeling, dryness, burning, stinging, and itching scores  will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_112983], frequency count and percentage  
for each visit . A similar summary will be  provided excluding subjects with signs or symptoms 
present at Baseline.  
 11.5.3 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) terminology. Treatment -emergen t adverse 
events (TEAEs) are AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study product  
administration. For the safety population, all reported TEAEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490], the number and percent of subjects reporting events, system organ class  (SOC), preferred 
term (PT), severity, relationship to study product , and seriousness. When summarizing TEAEs 
by [CONTACT_112984], each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or 
a preferred term by [CONTACT_258206].  
Additionally, treatment -related TEAEs  will be summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_16430], and further by [CONTACT_926] . A TEA E will be considered treatment- related if it is rep orted as 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment .  
SAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely discontinued from the study due to an AE will be provided. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing 
verbatim term given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system organ class, onset date, resolution date, maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding study product , corrective 
treatment, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to date of first administration. 
AEs related to study procedures done before study product  administration will be provided in a 
data listing.

APPENDIX 1: DECLARAT ION OF HELSINKI (201 3) 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_313717] WMA General Assembly,  Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
A. PREAMBLE   
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  The Declaration is intende d to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians . The 
WMA encourages other s who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt 
these principles.  
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the international Code o f Medical Ethics declares that “A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health , well -being and rights of patients, 
including those w ho are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.   
6. The primary purpose of medi cal research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evalua ted 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects 
and protect their health and rights.  
8. While the  primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician 
or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given 
consent.   
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international n orms and standards. No 
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes  possible harm to the e nvironment.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_112986], training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313718], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or comp ensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313719] submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
 
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of 
their personal information.  
 
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
 
25. Participation by [CONTACT_258208]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees.  
26. In medic al research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anti cipated benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail, post- study provisions and any other  relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the 
specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver 
the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the 
physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject's freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be 
given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent sho uld be sought by [CONTACT_11274].  
28. For a potential research subject who is in capable of giving informed consent , the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized r epresentative. These individuals must not be included 
in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the  group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons  capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in  research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 2.[ADDRESS_313720]'s dissent should be 
respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent , for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group . In such circumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the leg ally authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without 
informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that 
renders them unable  to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study 
has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -phys ician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data 
contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There ma y be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or 
impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after 
consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO 
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the 
best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patie nts who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of no receiving the best proven intervention. Extreme care must be tak en to avoid abuse of this option.  
J. POST -TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as 
benefi cial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed 
consent process.  
K. RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicl y accessible database 
before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the 
publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make  publicly 
available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and 
accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. 
Negative and inconclusive as well as positiv e results must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in 
the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or  other known 
interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent 
from the patien t or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This

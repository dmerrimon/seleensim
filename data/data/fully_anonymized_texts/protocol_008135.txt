1. Abstract 
Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA -approved therapy for 
treatment of acute ischemic stroke.  In the [LOCATION_002], IV tPA is typi[INVESTIGATOR_415986] (ED) for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 4.[ADDRESS_524267]-tPA patients are monitored in an intensive care unit or intensive care unit (ICU)-like setting for at least [ADDRESS_524268] of care. However, rigorous evidence to support this practice is largely lacking. In a retrospective analysis of 153 patients receiving IV tPA 
at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (JHH) and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC), we have 
shown that most patients who have ICU needs in the first 24 hours after tPA administration 
develop such needs by [CONTACT_415991]. Patients without ICU needs by [CONTACT_415992] 
(NIHSS) is below 10. Therefore, we seek approval to perform a prospective clinical trial that aims at establishing the first proof-of-concept and feasibility of whether tPA for acute ischemic stroke 
can safely be administered and subsequently monitored in a non-ICU setting for a select 
subpopulation of stroke patients with low NIHSS (NIHSS ≤ 9) who are without ICU needs by [CONTACT_415993]. Identifying post-tPA patients who can be safely monitored in a non-ICU 
environment may improve cost-effective utilization of ICU resources and reduce the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415987]. 
 
 
2. Objectives 
1. To establish that post-tPA monitoring for patients with minor stroke symptoms (NIHSS ≤ 9) can 
be done safely in a non-ICU setting. 
2. To establish that the functional outcome of post-tPA patients monitored in a non-ICU setting is 
no worse than for patients who were monitored in the ICU. 
 
 3. Background 
Stroke is a leading cause of disability in adults in the US. Currently, IV tPA is the only FDA -
approved acute therapy for treatment of ischemic stroke, and is routinely administered to pati ents in 
the ED within 4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms. After tPA administration in the ED, the 
patients are routinely monitored in the neurocritical care unit (NCCU)  for at least [ADDRESS_524269] recently analyzed the critical care needs and intervention s of 
153 patients who received IV tPA for acute ischemic s troke at JHH and JHBMC between 2010 and 
2013. We found that over 80% of post-tPA patients did not have critical care needs (Faigle et al, 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 1 Dated:  11/18/13

 manuscript submitted). Furthermore, our data show that 93% of patients without critical care needs 
by [CONTACT_415994][INVESTIGATOR_415988]. The risk of critical care needs for patients presenting with minor stroke symptoms, 
defined as a presenting NIHSS of 9 or less, was less than 1% if no ICU indication was present by 
[CONTACT_415991]. We hypothesize that patients  who receive IV tPA for acute ischemic 
stroke in the ED may be safely monitored in a non-ICU environment if they do not have an ICU indication by [CONTACT_415995] 10.  
 4. Study Procedures 
Design: 
The study is a multi-center (2 clinical sites) single arm, open label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833]. The aim is to 
provide proof -of-concept testing for the safety of  non-ICU care in post-tPA patients in acute stroke. 
The null hypothesis (Ho) is that patients who are monitored in a non-ICU environment post-tPA administration will have ICU needs exceeding 6% of all patients. Six percent was chose n as a cut-
off because this is the expected rate of hemorrhage after tPA administration in all stroke patients based on published literature. 
The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that no more than 6% of patients who are monitored in a non-ICU 
environment post-tPA administration will develop ICU needs. 
 
Treatment Regimen: IV tPA 0.9mg/kg, maximum of 90mg. Administered by [CONTACT_415996]: 10% of the dose by 
[CONTACT_415997], followed by [CONTACT_415998] [ADDRESS_524270] of care: 
Treatment with IV tPA will be initiated for patients with presumed ischemic stroke presenting within 4.[ADDRESS_524271] received the following procedures/tests: 
1. History, physical examination, and neurological examination including NIHSS . 
2. EKG, CBC, electrolytes, creatinine and BUN, PT and PTT.  
3. Two intravenous catheters will be started. 
4. A non-contrast CT scan of the brain or MRI of the brain per the standard of care protocol 
at the clinical site.  
Patients will receive routine care during the hour of tPA infusion in the ED according to the current standard of care. 
 
Study Interventions: 
Patients ages 18-80 are eligible to be enrolled in the study if they present with an NIHSS <[ADDRESS_524272] ICU needs by [CONTACT_415991]. A repeat NIHSS is recorded at the end 
of the tPA infusion by a member of the stroke team, and the patient or patient representative is  
approached for enrollment in the study if repeat NIHSS <[ADDRESS_524273] will then be monitored per the non-ICU care protocol (Hopkins protocol) 
with neurological exams and vital sign check s as specified below. Prior to transfer to the Brain 
Rescue Unit (BRU) (at JHH site) or Intermediate Medical Care ( IMC) (at JHBMC site ), subjects 
will undergo neurological exams and vital sign checks in the ED every [ADDRESS_524274] of care . 
Patients will then be moved to the BRU (at JHH) or IMC (at JHBMC) by [CONTACT_415999]. In order to facilitate bed availability fo r subjects enrolled in this study, a 
bed will be made available in an expedited fashion as soon as the decision to administer tPA in a potential subject is made (patients  with presumed acute ischemic stroke presenting with NIHSS 
<10). The admitting neurology resident accompanies the patient to the BRU (at JHH) or IMC (at JHBMC) and gives verbal sign-out to the receiving nurse at the bedside, as it is current standard of 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 1 Dated:  11/18/13    
Page 3 of 7 
 care. Sign-out to the receiving physician (senior resident on the stroke inpatient service at JHH or 
covering chief resident at JHBMC) will be given at the bedside upon arrival. 
The non-ICU protocol (Hopkins protocol) consists of the following schedule for neurological exams 
and vital sign checks by a stroke-trained nurse: at the time of admission to the unit, then again [ADDRESS_524275] ’s nurse. The NIHSS will be performed by [CONTACT_416000]. Nurses will have special training in caring for 
post tPA patients, and will be f amiliar with risks and warning signs of tPA related hemorrhage and 
other complications.  
To ensure safety of subjects monitored per non-ICU protocol at JHH, a rapid response (RRT) will 
be activated if the subject develops any new indication for ICU admission. An RRT includes a 
prompt evaluation by [CONTACT_21639]-call NCCU fellow with potential transfer to the NCCU if deemed 
clinically appropriate. RRT activation for subjects at JHBMC includes discussion with the 
neurology Chief resident and NCCU fellow for potential transfer to the NCCU if deemed indicated.  
 Criteria for RRT activation for potential ICU transfer are at the discretion of the treating medical 
team. In addition to commonly accepted criteria for ICU transfer, worsenin g of the neurological 
exam of >[ADDRESS_524276]. This is based on previously established criteria in the ECASS trial, in which neurologic 
worsening with an NIHSS >3 was used to evaluate for potential symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage 
1. 
Other commonly accepted criteria for need for ICU transfer may include, but may not be limited to , 
the following: 
• uncontrolled hypertension requiring active titration of IV antihypertensives  (more than 
two doses within 30 minutes or frequent dosing (e.g., q 1hr x 3 doses)) 
• need for vasopressors either for symptomatic systemic hypotension or blood pressure augmentation 
• need for invasive hemodynamic monitoring 
• uncontrolled hyperglycemia requiring IV Insulin  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_415989] (BiPAP) or mechanical ventilation 
• arterial bleeding 
• management of cerebral edema and increased ICP 
• need for neurosurgical intervention such as decompressive craniectomy 
• interventional angiography with or without intervention  
Once the decision is made to move the patient to the NCCU, subjects will receive routine NC CU 
care and the subject will be adjudicated as meeting the primary outcome.  
After 24 hours (+/- 4 hours)  patients will receive either a head CT without contrast or an MRI brain  
as it is the current standard of care, and will receive an NIHSS by a member o f the study team. 
Thereafter, patients will continue to receive standard care for stroke patients, and will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], when medically stable, to the appropriate rehabilitation setting, if any. At the time 
of discharge all patients will receive a modified Rankin score, and NIHSS.

5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
Subject selection: 
Both sites for this study are certified stroke centers (JHH and JHBMC). Patients presenting to the 
ED will be identified upon arrival as acute stroke patients and screened by [CONTACT_257691] p ersonnel for 
time of onset (this is standard procedure). The stroke team will evaluate the patients with a history and neurological exam as well as EKG, laboratory studies and a non -contrast head CT or MRI per 
the standard of care at the clinical site . Patients with presumed acute ischemic stroke will receive IV 
tPA in the usual fashion per the current standard of care if presenting to the ED within 4.5 hours of 
symptoms onset. Every patient receiving IV tPA for presumed acute ischemic stroke will be 
screened for the presence of inclusion criteria and absence of exclusion criteria, and if found to 
qualify for the study will be asked to participate after reviewing the details of the study and co nsent 
form.  
The investigator will explain the clinical trial to the patient or the Legally Authorized 
Representative (LAR) and will review the consent form, answering any questions. This will be conducted in a private and calm setting as much as it is poss ible in the ED. The patient or LAR will 
be given the consent form to review and a copy of signed consent form as well.  
 
Subjects will receive a subject ID that will be a sequential numerical code.  
  
Inclusion criteria: 
Subjects will be eligible if the following criteria are met:  
• Ability to provide written informed cons ent (or a LAR available to provide informed 
consent) and comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study.  
• Age 18-80 years 
 
Patient-related considerations (All criteria need to be met):  
• Patients to be included will be diagnosed as having an  acute ischemic stroke by [CONTACT_416001] 4.5 hours of symptom onset according to current guidelines for acute stroke care. 
• NIHSS at presentation <10 
• Patients do not have ICU needs in the judgment of the treating ED phys ician or neurologist 
by [CONTACT_415991] 
• NIHSS at the end of tPA infusion <10 
 Other considerations: 
• Some patients will not be able to provide informed consent. In these cases consent wil l be 
obtained from the Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR). 
• Patients that in the judgment of the investigator will not be able to comply with the follow up examinations due to known non-compliance, residence is distant, terminal illness, etc; 
will not be candidates for inclusion in the trial.

 Exclusion criteria: 
 
For patients receiving IV tPA according to the current standard of care, the following exclusion 
criteria apply: 
• Age <17 or >80 
• ICU need or indication by [CONTACT_415991] 
• NIHSS >9 at presentation or at the end of the tPA infusion 
• Indication/need for endovascular recanalization therapy  
 
 
6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices No experimental drug will be used in this trial. All patients will receive IV tPA per the standard of 
care. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is FDA-approved for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 
and will be administered at the standard dose for treatment of acute stroke: 0.9mg/kg, 10% IV 
bolus, and the rest by [CONTACT_416002]. Maximum dose is 90mg. tPA 
Indication and mode of IV tPA administration will occur  according to the current standard of care.  
 
 
7. Study Statistics  
Baseline Demographics: 
The sample size will be [ADDRESS_524278] been eligible to 
participate in this study based on above inclusion and exclusion criteria. Assuming a constant rate 
of tPA administration per year, this would yield about 27 study subjects per year at JHH and 
JHBMC, assuming a rate of agreement of 65%. Based on this assessment, this study can be 
completed in less than two years. 
 
Safety analysis: 
Because this study is designed to assess safety, the safety analysis is the same as the primary 
outcome analysis, which is the assessment of the rate of ICU needs and need for ICU transfer 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_415990] 24 hours after IV tPA administration. A DSMB (composed of one member 
independent of the investigator team) will conduct an analysis of the rate of ICU transfer in the 
study subjects. 
Need for ICU transf er (events) for patients monitored in the non -ICU setting will be evaluated after 
each subject completes [ADDRESS_524279]-tPA monitoring. During the phase of the study in which there are 1-9 subjects, the study will stop at any point there are two events  in this group. During the 
phase of the study in which there are 10-20 subjects, the study will stop at any point if there are three events. During the phase of the study in which there are 20-40 subjects, the study will stop at 
any point if there are four events. During the phase of the study in which there are 40-50 subjects, 
the study will stop at any point if there are five events. 
 
Primary endpoint: 
• Need for ICU care/interventions  (including intracerebral hemorrhage or cerebral edema with 
mass effect) within the first 24 hours after IV tPA administration will be the primary outcome measure. 
 Secondary endpoints: 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 1 Dated:  11/18/13    
Page 6 of 7 
 • NIHSS at 24 hours 
• NIHSS at discharge 
• Modified Rankin Scale at discharge 
• NIHSS at 90 days 
• Modified Rankin Scale at 90 days 
• Mortality at 90 days 
 
Analysis for the secondary endpoints will be done comparing outcomes of study subjects with 
matched (age, race, NIHSS) controls from our de-identified stroke database of patients receiving IV 
tPA for acute ischemic stroke under the standard protocol. 
 
Subject discontinuation: 
Subjects have a right to withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects that decide to withdraw from 
the study within the first [ADDRESS_524280] may be withdrawn from the study for any reasons: if it is in the best interest of the 
subject, intercurrent illness, adverse events, or worsening condition. The IRB, NINDS, the OHRP, 
the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research su bjects are 
protected, may request the withdrawal of a subject because of protocol violations, administrative 
reasons, or any other valid and ethical reasons. 
  
8. Risks  
Risks potentially associated with non-ICU monitoring may result from delayed recognition of 
medical or neurological deterioration, with limited capability of rapid interventi on in a non-ICU 
setting. Most complications related to IV tPA administration are neurological deterioration secondary to 
intracerebral hemorrhage. In our retrospective analysis, almost all patients who developed ICU 
needs after IV tPA developed such needs during the tPA infusion. In the present study, subjects are 
being monitored in the ED with frequent neurological examinations and vital sign checks during the 
tPA infusion, and for up to an additional hour, as it is the current standard of care. In the non-ICU 
setting, a stroke trained nurse will assess the patient u pon admission to the floor, and then again 
after [ADDRESS_524281] tPA patients, and will be familiar with risks and warning 
signs of tPA related hemorrhage and other complications. Per protoco l, any change in neurological 
exam will result in a formal evaluation by [CONTACT_416003]. At JHH an RRT (with evaluation by [CONTACT_21639]-call NCCU 
fellow) for potential transfer to the NCCU  will be activated for any increase in NIHSS > 3 points 
from baseline (post-tPA NIHSS). Similarly, any medical deterioration requiring ICU care in the judgment of the provider will result in activation of an RRT with potential transfer to the NCCU.  
Similar ly, at JHBMC RRT activation for subjects  will follow the same criteria, and  includes 
discussion with the neurology Chief resident and NCCU fellow for potential transfer to the NCCU 
if deemed indicated. 
 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AE) and serious 
adverse events (SAE) that are considered to be related  to non-ICU monitoring, all events of death, 
and any study specific issue of concern.  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 1 Dated:  11/18/13    
Page 7 of 7 
 An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or dis ease temporally 
associated with non-ICU monitoring. 
 
This includes the following: 
• Any event or change in condition within the first 24 hours after tPA administration that 
requires ICU care or ICU intervention. 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with ischemic stroke that were not present prior to the AE reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_13655]-specified AE reporting period. 
 
An AE should be classified as an SAE if: 
• It results in death 
• It is life threatening 
• It requires prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_168204], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be 
reported appropriately. 
 
 
9. Benefits By [CONTACT_416004], participants may benefit from an expedited str oke 
work-up and reduced length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Admission directly to the floor would result in less frequent interruptions for neurological exams and vital sign checks, which may improve quality of 
sleep. In addition, by[CONTACT_416005]-offs between different 
providers and provider teams, and thereby [CONTACT_416006]. Avoiding unnecessary ICU admission would greatly reduce cost for stroke admissions and reduce the 
financial burden on society associated w ith acute stroke care. 
 
 
10. Payment and Remuneration There will be no payment to participants. 
 
 
11. Costs There are no anticipated additional costs  to participants.

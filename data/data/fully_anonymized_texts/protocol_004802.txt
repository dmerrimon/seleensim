Research Strategy .  This is a prospective, randomized, cross -over study.   
Subjects and Recruitment.  A total of 15 individuals with chronic stroke (>[ADDRESS_241337] -stroke) will be enrolled 
to complete the  aim of this study . Males and females will be recruited equally. Inclusion criteria:  Study participants 
must be between 18 -85 years of age, able to give informed consent, >[ADDRESS_241338] residual lower limb paresis.  Exclusion criteria:  History of blood clots in the extremities 
or any condition in which compression of the thigh or transient ischemia is contraindicated (e.g. wounds in the 
leg), chronic pain syndrome, history of head trauma, comorbid neurological disorder , any uncontrolled  
hypertension (>160/100 mmHg),  peripheral  vascular  disease,  a myoca rdial infarction  in the previous year, 
inability  to follow 2 step commands, or history of multiple  stroke s.   
Study participants will be recruited from two sources , a HIPP A compliant database  of >[ADDRESS_241339]. Durand which contains the names of 
>200 individuals with stroke consented to be contact[CONTACT_127775] .  The PI’s have successfully used 
these resources to recruit stroke survivors for previous studies.  Participants will be paid $50 per visit.  
General Methods : Study participants will be instructed to fast for [ADDRESS_241340] of current medications.  
10 mL of venous blood will be drawn from an indwelling catheter in the antecubital vein of the non -affected arm 
into a vacutainer tube with lithium heparin.  A total of t hree blood draws will be performed – at rest, immediately 
following IC or Sham IC, and immediately following the CPT.  The tubes will immediately be centrifuged at 2500 
RPM for 15 minutes at 4 ºC to separate the plasma fraction.  The plasma will be transfer red to storage vials, 
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80ºC until analysis.   
IC and IC Sham :  IC will be performed in accordance with other studies which have used IC as an 
intervention1-3 and consistent with our previous work.4-6  Briefly, in supi[INVESTIGATOR_202288], a rapid 
inflation cuff (Hokanson SC12 thigh cuff) will be placed around the proximal , paretic  thigh  and inflated to 225 
mmHg for 5 minutes, then released for a 5 minute recovery period .  Five cycles of inflation/recovery will be 
performed.  For IC Sham , the cuff will only be inflated to [ADDRESS_241341]:   Water will be cooled to 4-6ºC in a bucket  and circulated with a sous vide precision cooker .  
Study participants will submerge their non -affected hand, up to the wrist, into the water for two minutes.  Blood 
pressure and subjective pain will be measured before, during (1 minute) and after the test.  Blood will be drawn 
immediately after the test.  Skin temperature will be assessed with a skin thermometer.

PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Clinical Protocol CA209548
Protocol Title: A Randomized Phase 3 Single Blind Study of Temozolomide plus Radiation Therapy combined with 
Nivolumab or Placebo in Newly Diagnosed Adult Subjects with MGM T-Methylated (tumor O6-methylguanine DNA 
methyltransferase) Glioblastoma
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS-936558) 240 mg IV or p lacebo as a 30 minute infusion every 2 weeks for 8 doses
followed by [CONTACT_20382] 480 mg as a 30 minute infusion every 4 wee ks beginning after 8 doses until progression, 
unacceptable toxicity (or other reasons), and temozolomide 75 mg/m2orally d ailyduring radiation therapy followed 
by 4 week break then 6 (28-day) cycles temozolomide on Days 1-5  at 150 mg/m2in Cycle 1 increasing to 200 mg/m2
as tolerated up to 6 cycles. 
Study Phase: 3
Research Hypothesis: Addition of nivolumab to standard radiotherapy (RT) plus temozolomide (TMZ) will increase 
PFS in subjects wit h newly-diagnosed GBM of MGMT- methylated or ind eterminate subtypes and will increase OS 
in subjects with newly-d iagnosed GBM of MGMT- methylated or ind eterminate subtypes without bas eline 
corticosteroids and regardless of baseline corticosteroids.
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
The two primary objectives are: 
•To compare PFS of subjects with newly-diagnosed MGMT methylated  or indeterminate GBM subtypes 
treated with RT plus TMZ combined with nivolumab or placebo. PFS  will be determined by [CONTACT_215296].
•To compare OS of subjects with newly-diagnosed MGMT methylated or indeterminate GBM subtypes 
without baseline corticosteroids and regardless of baseline cor ticosteroids (ie, all-comers) treated with RT 
plus TMZ combined with nivolumab or placebo.
Secondary Objective:
•To compare OS of subjects with newly-diagnosed MGMT methylated or indeterminate GBM subtypes 
without baseline corticosteroids and regardless of baseline cor ticosteroids (ie, all comers) treated with RT 
plus TMZ combined with nivolumab or placebo at 12 and 24 months .
•To compare PFS based on inves tigator assessment by [CONTACT_215297] a of subjects with newly-diagnosed 
MGMT methylated or indeterminate GBM subtypes treated with RT plus TMZ combined with nivolumab or 
placebo.

Study Design:
Th
is study w ill enroll subjects with newly-diagnosed GBM, following surgical  resection of the tumor. Tumor tissue 
will be evaluated for MGMT methylation by a central laboratory assay through the CA209498 study. After enrolling 
in the CA209498 study, the subjects may e nroll in the CA209548 study and begin the screening process whi le they 
wait for the MGMT results. The screening number assigned in the  CA209498 IVRS will be the same subject number 
entered by [CONTACT_215298]209548 IVR S. Those with a MGMT status of methylated or 
indeterminate may be eligible to randomize in the CA209548 stud y.
In order to randomize 693 eligible subjects, a total of approximately 780 subjects are expected to be enrolled. After 
signing consent, eligibility for randomization will be document ed. When ready to begin study treatment, subjects will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the RT/TMZ/nivolumab or the RT/ TMZ/placebo arm, stratified by [CONTACT_215299]. complete 
resection. All subjects who enter the treatment phase, ie, all randomized subjects, will be  followed for safety and 
tolerability, tumor progression and survival. 
A contrast-enhanced MRI should be performed approximately 4 wee ks (±7 days) after completing radiation therapy, 
then every 8 weeks ( ±7 days) up to [ADDRESS_258937] ra ndomization, then every 12 weeks  until progression regardless 
of treatment schedule or dose delay. Tumor progression will be a ssessed using Radiologic Assessment in Neuro-
Oncology criteria (RANO).  
On 09-Dec-2020 the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) conducted a pre -planned routine safety review of all 
available safety data, and initially recommended that the study  continue unchanged. Subsequently, the DMC noted 
that it is not possible for the study to demonstrate an OS bene fit for the investigational treatment arm, and after further 
discussion with the DMC, the decision was made to unblind all st udy subjects, and inform all investigators, ethics 
committees, and health authorities as required. Following study  unblinding, subjects may continue nivolumab and/or 
TMZ (if applicable) treatment, following protocol procedures. A fter cessation of nivolumab and/or TMZ treatment 
for any reason, all randomized sub jects will enter a short follow-up phase for reporting of treat ment-related adverse 
events. Subjects in whom disease progression had not been detect ed at the time st udy tr eatment is stopped will no 
longer be followed for progression. All subjects will no longer be followed for survival.
A DMC will meet regularly during the study until study unblinding to ensure that subject safety is carefully monitored.

Subjects should begin study tr eatment within 3 days of randomization and chemoradiation withi n 7 days, but RT 
should begin within 42 days after definitive resection; may be delayed if clinically required. Subjects will continue on 
study treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity, withd rawal of consent, or the study ends, whichever comes 
first. 
Study Assessments:
Safety Evaluation: Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for [ADDRESS_258940] recovered to baseline or are deemed irreversible by [CONTACT_093]. 
Efficacy Assessments: Post-operative baseline MRI following consensus recommendations must be obtained prior to 
randomization. It is strongly recommended that this scan be obt ained <72 hours or >[ADDRESS_258941]. Tumor imaging assessments following recent co nsensus recommendations will occur 4 weeks 
(±7 days) after completion of radiotherapy (baseline MRI) then eve ry  8  w e e k s  ( ±7 days) up to [ADDRESS_258942] discontinued all study treat ment. Per RANO, assessment of disease progression 
during study requires that MRI scan be performed >12 weeks after RT; it is therefore recommended that second on-
treatment scan be per formed at least [ADDRESS_258943]-treatment Follow-up visits 1 
and 2 (~[ADDRESS_258944] dose); following study unblindi ng, Follow- up visits 1 and 2 are only required for 
subjects discontinuing nivolumab and/or temozolomide. Survival status will be assessed every 3 months after follow-
up visits are completed and may be  completed via telephone or at in person visits; following study unblinding, survival 
status will not be assessed. Images will be submitted to a centr al imaging vendor for blinded independent central

review (BICR) at any time during the study until study unblinding. Prior to scanning first participant, sites should be 
qualified and understand the image acquisition guidelines and s ubmission process as outlined in the CA209-548 
Imaging Manual provided by [CONTACT_11343].
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: Approximately 693 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, s tratified by [CONTACT_215301]. 
Of these 693 subjects, 485 subjects are assumed to be considere d as no baseline corticosteroids. Accrual is estimated 
to take approximately 25 months based on an observed monthly accr ual in CA209548 of approximately 28 subjects 
per month; in the no baseline corticosteroids population, a pie cewise accrual of 1, 4, 5, 8, 13, 16, 19, and then 
[ADDRESS_258945] 337 OS even ts in no baseline corticosteroid population are needed 
to achieve 88% power using a 2-sided Type 1 error of 4%. This n umber of events is projected to occur after an 
additional 44 months of follow-up (ie, at 69 months). 
One interim analysis will be conducted on OS in the randomized po pulation with no baseline corticosteroid.  It will 
occur with approximately 70% or 236 OS events is reached. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_215274], using Lan DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. If the planned interim analyses occur exactly at the planned number of events, the 
projected alpha level will be 0.011 and 0.037. The interim analys is will also be conducted in OS in the overall 
randomized population. The interim analysis will be conducted at the same time as the interim for the no baseline 
corticosteroids population in a hierarchy with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_215275]-DeMet s alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries. 
The PFS comparisons will be  based on first [ADDRESS_258946] 404 PFS events are needed 
to achieve 90% power using a 2-sided Type 1 error of 1%. Accrua l is estimated to take approximately 23 months and 
this number of events is projected to occur after an additional  12 months of follow-up (ie, at 35 months).
Endpoints:
The two primary endpoints of the trial will be OS in the randomiz ed population with no corticosteroids at baseline as 
well as in the overall rando mized population, and PFS determined by [CONTACT_215302].
Secondary endpoints: OS rate at 12 months and 24 months estimate d from OS Kaplan-Meier curve. PFS determined 
by [CONTACT_215303].
Analyses:
Primary EndpointsOS is defined as time from the date of randomization to the dat e of death. Subjects who have not died by [CONTACT_215304]. OS will be  assessed in the randomized population with no 
corticosteroids at baseline population and in the overall randomized population.
The distribution of OS in the sub-population of subjects with n o baseline corticosteroids and in all randomized subjects 
will be compared in arms RT + TMZ + nivolumab and RT + TMZ at i nterim and final analyses via two-sided, log-rank 
tests, stratified by [CONTACT_215305]. The boundaries for declaring superiority at the 
interim and final analyses w ill be based on the actual number of OS events at the time of the analysis using Lan DeMets 
alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. For example, if the interim and fi nal analyses occur exactly 
at the planned number of events, superiority of an arm will be declared if P ≤ 0.011 at the interim analysis or P ≤0.[ADDRESS_258947] limit method wi ll be used to estimate the survival curve in each arm 
including medians and its 95% CI, OS rates at various time poin ts. The HR and the corresponding two sided 
(1-adjusted α) % CIs will be estimated in a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment arm as a single covariate 
stratified by [CONTACT_215306] (complete or partial surgical resection at baseline).
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression or death by [CONTACT_215307]. Subjects who did not have disease progression or die will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. 
Subjects who did not have any on study tumor assessment and did  not die will be censored at the last tumor assessment.

corticosteroids.The CA209548 DMC convened on 09-Dec-[ADDRESS_258950] a positive OS result at the final analys is 
based on either all randomized sub jects or on subjects wit hout baseline corticosteroids. This is based on the DMC’s 
review of the OS results to date, with over 80% of the final required number of events reached and related statistical 
considerations including conditional power of < 1% for a statistically significant final result.
While the group receiving nivolumab has a higher incidence of toxicities, the DMC members believed the increased 
toxicity was expected and did not warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_215276], and recommended to unblind the sites 
and subjects, which was approved by [CONTACT_1034]. The study was officially unblinded to investigators on 22-Dec -2020.
As a consequence, the timing of th e primary OS analysis, origina lly planned when 337 and 494 events were to be 
reached respectively for the population without corticosteroids  at baseline and the overall population, has been 
updated. To prevent any bias due to unblinding of subjects, the primary OS analysis will be conducted using the cut-
off date (or last patient last visit [LPLV]) of 22-Dec-2020, wh ich is when the study was unblinded.
Secondary Endpoint
OS rates at [ADDRESS_258951] 558 subjects, all randomized subjects and all 
randomized subjects who did not receive corticosteroids at base line.
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed at the same time as th e OS and PFS primary analyses using the analysis 
methods already defined in the SAP.

The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This study will e nroll subjects with newly-diagnosed GBM, following surgical res ection of the 
tumor. Tumor tissue will be evaluated for MGMT methylation by a central la boratory assay 
Protocol Amendment No.: 07
Date: 02-Sep-[ADDRESS_258963] into the CA209548 IVRS. Those wit h a MGMT status of methylated 
or indeterminate may be eligible to randomize in the CA209548 s tudy. In order to rando mize 
693 eligible subjects, a total of approximately 780 sub jects w ill be evaluated. For details, see 
Section 3.1.1 . 
Subjects with a central laboratory result of MGMT-methylated or  indeterminate may continue in 
the screening phase, in which eligibility for randomization will be documented and baseline 
demographic and disease information submitted; for details, see  Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_258964] udy treatment, subj ects will proceed to t he treatment phase of the study; 
for details, see Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_258965]-enhanced MRI should be performed 4 weeks ( ±7 days) after completing 
radiation therapy, then subsequent scans should be every 8 weeks  (±7 days) up to 24 months, then 
every 12 weeks until progression regardless of treatment schedu le or dose delays. Tumor 
progression will be assessed using RANO described in Section 5.4.2 .  
 
 For the purposes of this protocol, each cycle  duration is 2 weeks until 8 doses of 
240 mg of nivolumab/placebo are com plete. The remaining subsequ ent cycles (480 mg or placebo 
infusio n, starting Week 17 in the absence of delays) are 4 weeks in dur ation. Cycle 9 should start 
2 weeks after Cycle 8 begins. 
After cessation of all study treatment for a ny reason, all randomized subjects will enter a follow-up 
phase. In the short-term, visits are defined for reporting of t reatment-related adverse events. 
Following study unblinding, subjects who discontinue all tr eatment w ill not be followed for 
progression per RANO criteria, or for survival. For details on th e follow-up phase, see Section  
3.1.3 . 
Baseline and all subsequent scans will be submitted to blinded independent central review (BICR) 
for review, once the subject is randomized and until study unbli nding on 22-Dec-2020. 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will meet regularly during the study until study unblinding 
to ensure that subject safety is carefully monitored, see Section 7 .
The study design schematic is presented in Figure 3.1-1 .

3.1.1 Screening Phase
Subjects will provide consent for enrollment and tumor submissi on in the peri-operative period in 
the CA209498 study so that MGMT status can be determined. Consent for enrollment in the
CA209548 study will o ccur while waiting for the MGMT results to  be obtained and randomization 
and study treatment w ill occur once MGMT s tatus of methylated or ind eterminate is known and 
eligibility is established ( Figure 3.1.1- 1).

Figure 3.1.1-1: Screening and Randomization
A centralized tumor tissue assay for MGMT is required as part o f the CA209498 MGMT testing. 
Subjects will consent to the MGMT testing and the CA209548 stud y simultaneously. Following 
informed consent for both studi es, subjects will be enrolled vi a a call to an IVRS system f or the 
CA209498 MGMT testing, in order to obtain a s ubject number. Imm ediately after the subject 
number is obtained from the CA [ADDRESS_258966] be entered into 
the eCRF. 
When possible, subjects  should not be on cor ticosteroids at Scr eening. It is expected that 
corticosteroid therapy will be tapered to the maximum extent po ssible during this phase. Subjects 
who cannot tolerate tapering of steroids to < 20 mg prednisone o r < 3 mg dexamethasone per day 
(or equivalent) are not eligible for randomization.RT should begin within 42 days of surgical resection but may be dela yed if clinically required. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the time from screening procedure to treatment should  not exceed 28 days, but may be 
longer if clinically indicated. If repeat resection to improve tumor control is performed for 
newly-diagnosed GBM pri or to any other therapy (eg, upon referral to research site), the 42-day 
interval should restart at the time of this second s urgery and a new post-operative MRI must be 
performed. 
3.1.2 Treatment Phase
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization and Initiation of TreatmentAfter eligibility has been confirmed, subjects who are clinical ly ready to begin study treatment 
(ie, recovered from surgery) will proceed to the treatment phase of the study via a second call into 
the IVRS system. At this call, subjects w ill be randomized 1:1 to receive radiotherapy, 
temozolomide plus nivolumab or radiotherapy, temozolomide plus placebo. 
Randomization will be prospectively balanced (ie, stratified) a ccording to post-operative MRI 
finding of “complete” versus “partial” resecti on. For the purposes of this study, a complete 
resection will be defined as ≤[ADDRESS_258967] tumor surgical region following surgical resection. A part ial resection is  defined as ≥10 mm MGMT Assay

The total time elapsed from definitive s urgery to initiation of RT s hould not exceed 42 days but 
may be delayed if clinically required. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a delay from randomization to initiation of 
chemoradiation may be up to 7 days, or longer if clinically req uired. Subjects should begin 
nivolumab or placebo within 3 days after randomization and may b e given at any time prior to 
chemoradiation start. 
See Sections  4.5.1 and 4.5.2 for details of dosing for nivolumab and temozolomide; for an 
overview of the treatment phase, see Section 3.1.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy s hould begin after substantial recovery from surgical resection, preferably not 
more than 42 days after surgery; however, treatment may be delay ed if clinically required. 
External-beam RT to a total dose of 60 Gy will be administered in daily doses of 2 Gy, typ ically 
on a 5 days on / 2 days off schedule as a ppropriate for sche duling, over 6-7 weeks. P atients 
considered clinically inappropriate for full dose RT (60 Gy ±5%) are not eligible, eg, due to older 
age, tumor location. RT is administered to the post-operative t umor volume plus a 2-[ADDRESS_258969] be obtained if not part of

treatment, including for adverse events, for maximum clin ical benefit (investigator decisio n), for 
subject request, disease progression, or another reason.
Following study unblinding, subjects who discontinue the experi mental arm will be evaluated for 
adverse events with visits at 35 days ( ±7 days) and 115 days ( ±7 days) after last dose; for details, 
see Table 5.1-3 and Section 6 . Subjects on placebo arm who discontinue study temozolomide 
treatment will be eva luated for adverse events with a visit at 35 days ( ±7 days) after last dose. All 
adverse events must be documented for a minimum of 100 days aft er discontinuation of nivolumab
and for 30 days following discontinuation of temozolomide treat ment, but drug-related toxicities 
should continue to be followed until they resolve, return to ba seline, or are deemed irreversible.
Subjects will not be followe d for progression per RA NO criteria, or for survival.

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any femal e who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hyst erectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined a s [ADDRESS_258985] imulating hormone (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificial ly 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their judgment 
in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the w oman can be considered 
postmenopausal.

3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
Concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy, including other chemotherap y, immunotherapy, additional 
radiation therapy or investigational agents for treatment of GB M are prohibited during the 
treatment phase. Use of any additional noninvasive medical devi ce treatment of GBM 
(eg, novoTTF, Optune ©) is prohibited. The following medications are prohibited durin g the study 
treatment (unless utilized to treat a drug related adverse even t):
•Immunosuppressive agents
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 3.4.3 ) 
•Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, live COVID- 19, varicella, zos ter, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral

3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with eit her corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily 
prednisone per day or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive me dications (including within 
14 days of rando mization) a re excluded. Subjects continuing to require supra physiologic steroids 
(prednisone > 20 mg daily or > 3 mg dexamethasone per day or equ ivalent) for increased intra 
cranial pressure may not be randomized. Inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_215278] > 10 mg daily prednisone per day or equivalent are permitted in the absence of active 
autoimmune disease.
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Restriction and Precautions
Study-related MRI imaging of the brain will be performed using contrast materials. It is the local 
imaging facility’s responsibility t o determine, base d on participant attributes  (eg, allergy history, 
diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast regimen per 
imaging study. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks are to be considered in this 
assessment. Participants with renal insufficiency are to be ass essed as to whether or not they should 
receive contrast and if so, which contrast agent and dose is ap propriate. Specific to MRI, 
participants with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glo merular filtration rate 
(eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic s ystemic fibrosis, therefore 
MRI contrast is contraindicated. In addition, participants may be excluded from MRI if they have 
tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the image acquisition manual.
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow loc al standard of care. The ultimate 
decision to perform MRI in an indi vidual participant in this study rests with the site radiologist, 
the investigator, and standards set by [CONTACT_215313].

prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-a utoimmune conditions 
(eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity r eaction cause d by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted.
Steroid use should be  minimized prior to ra ndomization. Systemic corticosteroid use or 
physiologic rep lacement doses of steroids are permitted, even if > 20 mg/day pre dnisone 
equivalents, for: a) treatment-related AEs; b) symptoms related to GBM, including suspected 
tumor flare or pse udoprogression; or c) treatment of non-autoimm une conditions (eg, prophylaxis

[IP_ADDRESS] Continuing Nivolumab/Placebo with Suspected Progression
Accumulating evidence indicates that a minority of subjects tre ated with immunotherapy may 
derive clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_215280], eg, due to inflammatory 
reaction simulating progression (“tumor flare” or pseudoprogres sion). At the discretion of the 
investigator, subjects may continue nivolumab in the setting of  suspected progression until 
progression is confirmed. [Note: this is not the same as confirmation of progression occurring 
within 12 weeks after RT, which is a component of RANO criteria .] Communication with the BMS 
Medical Monitor is strongly encouraged. If the investigator bel ieves that the subject continues to 
derive clinical benefit by [CONTACT_43893], the subject sho uld continue assessments according 
to Table 5.1-2 .
Subjects may continue nivolumab beyond suspected progression only if they meet the following 
criteria:
•Subject is tolerating nivolumab
•Treatment will not delay intervention to prevent imminent compl ications, eg surgery for relief 
of symptomatic intracranial mass effect 
•Investigator-assessed overall clinical benefit
Radiographic assessment should be repeated after suspected prog ression as clinically required in 
order to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tum or size  or continued progression. 
If possible, perfusion images s hould also be obtained. All MRI scans should be submi tted to the 
imaging vendor as soon as possible. 
Re-operation should be considered, if lesion is surgically acce ssible, to differentiate immune-
treatment effects from progression. The BMS Medical Monitor sho uld be consulted. Potential for 
clinical benefit s hould be b alanced by [CONTACT_2085] j udgment as to whether the subject is clinically 
deteriorati ng and unlikely to receive benefit from continued treatment wit h nivolumab. Nivolumab 
treatment should be discontinued  permanently upon confirmation of RANO-assessed progression 
but prolonged observation (eg, 3 months) may be required, as su ggested in Okada et al.48

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Nivolumab/Placebo-Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequ ences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensi tivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headach e, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, 
hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic-like  reactions. All Grade [ADDRESS_259017] udy medical monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criter ia. Infusion reactions should b e graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Version 4.03) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; in fusion interrupti on not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
•Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms. The following 
prophylactic prem edications are recomme nded for future i nfusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/pa racetamol [ADDRESS_259018] 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab/placebo administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or infusion inter ruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment (eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours):
•Stop the nivolumab/placebo i nfusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and tr eat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or ac etaminophen/paracetamol 
325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subject until reso lution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be admini stered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of the original infusion r ate when

symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 mi nutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion r ate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, 
then no further nivolumab/placebo will be administered at that visit.
•For future infusions, the following prophy lactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol [ADDRESS_259019] 30 minutes before nivolumab/pla cebo infusions . If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of SoluCortef  or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prol onged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_52202]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improv ement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] (e g, renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates). Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or v entilatory support indicated):
•Immediately discontinue infusion o f nivolumab/p lacebo. Begin an IV infusion of normal s aline 
and treat the sub ject as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators , epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutane ous administrati on or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 5 0 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject  should be monitored until 
the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recu r. Nivolumab/placebo w ill be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their ins titutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject  until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersen sitivity symptoms (eg, appear ance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.5.2 Temozolomide Dosing
[IP_ADDRESS] Temozolomide Dose and Schedule
Subjects will be administered temozolomide (TMZ, Temodar®) daily during RT and as 
maintenance therapy for 6 cycles. TMZ dosing will be performed according to investigator 
judgment; the following guidance is drawn from published literature.
TMZ will be dosed at 75 mg/m2once per day continuously throughout RT, typi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] 42 days 
and with a maximum of 49 days. See Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 for dose modifications during concomitant 
RT+TMZ dosing. After completion of RT, there will be a 4 week br eak. Subjects w ill receive 
6 cycles of temozolomide daily x 5 days every 28 days. The timing of maintenance TMZ cycles 
may be adjusted for clinical convenience, eg, to coincide with n ivolumab/placebo dosing.

Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1: Dose Levels for Maintenance TMZ Monotherapy
Dose Level TMZ Dose in mg/m2/day Notes
-1 100 mg/m2/day Reduction for prior toxicity
0 150 mg/m2/day Dose during first maintenance cycle
1 200 mg/m2/dayDose during subsequent maintenance TMZ in absence of TMZ-
related toxicity
Source: adapted from Temodar ®package insert (PI)
In the first maintenance cycle, TMZ is given at a dose of 150 mg /m2, and then increased to 
200 mg/m2in Cycle 2 as follows: If, during the first cycle, all non-hema tologic AEs observed were 
Grade ≤2 (except alopecia, nausea and vomiting) and with platelets ≥100 x 109/L and 
ANC≥1.5 x109/L, then the temozolomide dose should be escalated to dose level 1, and this dose 
should be used as the starting dose for subsequent cycles. Doses  of TMZ are not precise but are 
adjusted based on tolerance; rounding of up to 10% is entirely acceptable.  
If treatment after Cycle  1 has to be delayed because of ongoing non-hematologic AEs of Grade≥2, 
then no escalation is possible. If the dose was not escalated a t Cycle 2, then the dose should not be 
escalated in further cycles based on adverse events (see Table [IP_ADDRESS]-2 ). If there was a prior dose 
reduction or discontinuation during the concomitant period with  RT, then dose -1 should be the 
starting dose for subsequent cycles. Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 describes dose levels during temozolomide 
maintenance.
As noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , if toxicity is related to TMZ only, then only that agent shou ld be 
interrupted. If the toxicity is considered related to either TMZ  or nivolumab/placebo; however, 
both may be delayed, based on investigator judgment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria to Start Temozolomide Maintenance Cycles 
Maintenance treatment begins fo llowing a 4-week treatment break after RT. TMZ treatment may 
begin if blood count (obtained within the pri or 3 days) shows ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet count 
≥100 x 109/L and any Grade ≥3 non-hematologic AE (except alopecia) must have resolved to 
Grade≤1). If AEs persist, treatment should be delayed by [ADDRESS_259020] still not resolved to ≤Grade 1: then a ny further main tenance 
treatment with temozolomide should be discontinued.

[IP_ADDRESS] Supportive Care during Temozolomide
Subjects should be treated to r eceive prophylaxis against Pneum ocystis pneumonia (inhaled 
pentamidine [preferred], dapsone or oral trimethoprim–sulfametho xazole) during concomitant 
treatment wit h RT plus TMZ and may be continued during maintena nce at investigator discretion. 
Details regarding prophylactic agent use will be collected as co ncomitant medications.
Antiemetic prophylaxis with metoclopramide or a 5-hydroxytrypta mine [ADDRESS_259022] is allowed 
prior to treatment with temozolomide.
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
The blinding strategy selected for the protocol is the single-blinding design, also called 
“site-subject blinded.”50The subjects, investigator, and site staff will be blinded to th e study 
therapy administered. Each investigative site must assign an un blinded pharmacist/designee. 
Designated staff of BMS Research & Development will be unblinde d to facilitate drug supply and 
safety monitoring.  
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity o f this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subj ect in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the subject’s management , the blind for that subject may be 
broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety takes priority  over any other considerations in 
determining if the treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment,  the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it w ill alter the sub ject’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is c learly not related to the 
investigation al product, the  problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly desirable that the decis ion to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor, but the investigator  always has ultimate aut hority 
for the decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215281] n to discontinue the subject has been made. On ce the subject is unblinded, the 
decision to discontinue cannot be reversed. For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IVRS. For 
information on how to unblind for emergency, please consult the  IVRS manual.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_215322].
On 09-Dec-2020, the DMC conducted a pre-planned routine safety re view of all available safety 
data and initially recommended th at the study continue unchange d. Subsequently, the DMC noted

preferred). Additional MRI scan may be obtained if clinically appropriate, eg, for radiotherapy 
planning, but are not required; in this case the last scan prio r to randomization that meets the 
diagnostic quality required in the imaging manual provided by t he central imaging vendor will be 
considered the baseline MRI. 
On treatment and follow-up assessments may be performed at desi gnated time points in Table 5.1-
2and Table 5.1-3 (±7 days). Per RANO, assessment of disease progression during stu dy requires 
that MRI scan be performed >12 weeks after RT; it is, therefore , recommended that second 
on-treatment scan be performed at least 84 days after completio n of RT. Investigators ma y obtain 
more frequent follow-up MRI scans as med ically ind icated. 
 
 Local radiologic assessment of tumor measurem ents will be used for clinical 
management and investigator-assessed disease progression (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section 5.4.2 ).
Subjects who are unable (due to coexisting medical condition, e g, pacemaker or ICD device) or 
unwilling to have a brain MRI at baseline are excluded from the  study. Subjects who become 
unable to undergo MRI imaging after randomization may continue in the study for assessment of 
overall survival as long as there is no safety issue which woul d require monitoring by [CONTACT_9268]. 
Images will be submitted to a central imaging vendor for blinde d independent central review 
(BICR) at any time during the study until study unblinding. Prior to scanning first participant, sites 
should be qualified and understand the image acquisition guidel ines and submission process as 
outlined in the CA209-[ADDRESS_259043] 
medical/clinical judgment.
Sites will be trained in image acquisition parameters, image su bmission process, application of 
RANO criteria34(as outlined in Section 5.4.2 ) prior to scanning the first study subject. These 
guidelines will be outlined in a separate Site Imaging Manual, following recent consensus 
recommendations.51All radiologic imaging from this study (including scans performed prior to 
Screening) until study unblinding will be transmitted to a centr alized imaging core lab for BICR.
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that ar e not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by t he Study investigator as per 
standard medical/clinical judgment.
5.4.1 Suspected Progression
In order to distinguish potential tr eatment eff ects (or “pse udoprogression”) from progressive 
disease and thus to minimize premature discontinuation of nivol umab or temozolomide, subjects 
Protocol Amendment No.: 07
Date: 02-Sep-[ADDRESS_259044] be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_215328] 8 weeks after the initial radio logical assessment of progression. 
Prior to 12 weeks after RT, progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if the re is 
new enhancement outside of the  radiation field (beyond the high -dose region or 80% isodose line) 
or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopat hologic sampling.33Note: in the 
absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of progressi on, clinical decline alone is not 
sufficient for definition of progressive disease. 
If the follow-up assessment confirms that progression has occur red, the date of  progression will 
be the date at which progression was first determined. If the follow-up assessment does not confirm 
progression, then the original time point response will be asse ssed as SD.

OS. If no signs of progression are observed, according to MRI, the radiologic assessment will be 
categorized as SD. The appear ance of any index or non-index les ion consistent with tumor will be 
categorized as PD.The assessments that will contribute to evaluation of PD includ e response assessments recorded 
between the date of randomization and the first to occur of the  following:
•The date of objectively documented progression per RANO criteri a
•The date of subse quent therapy, or
•The date of pathology results from diagnostic surgical resectio n

is sufficient to declare progression on current treatment but not for entry onto a clinical trial for recurrence.

must have occurred with the patient on stable or increasing dos es of corticosteroids 
compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation o f therapy and not be a result 
of comorbid events (eg, effects  of radiation therapy, demyelina tion, ischemic injury, 
infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects).

5.6.1 Tumor Samples
 
Tumor tissu e (block or slides) 
must be available for submission prior to randomization. If a b lock is not available, a minimum of 
20 unstained slides of g ood qu ality is required. In situations where on-tr eatment biopsies or 
surgeries are performed, tumor sample should be sent for centra l pathology reading.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Sample Collection Details
Collection of tumor tissue at diagnostic  surgery is require d for study eligibility. Additional biopsies 
obtained at any time, eg, if progression is suspected, should a lso be submitted. 
Biopsy samples from ne urosurgical resections should be fixed in 10% Neutral-buffered formalin 
for 24 – 48 hours prior to paraffin embedding. Tumor tissue samp les should not be shipped in 
formalin as the temperature and length of fixation cannot be co ntrolled during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
 2 paraffin blo cks are requested 
(1 minimum). If only slides are a vailable, they s hould be unstai ned, have a recommended tissue 
section thickness of [ADDRESS_259050] be shipped refrigerated at 
2-8° C.
An assessment of tissue quality by a pathologist is strongly en couraged at the time of the 
procedure.

core lab.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening o f a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subje ct administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (s uch as an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom , or disease 
Protocol Amendment No.: 07
Date: 02-Sep-2021 78
Approved 8.0 v

Clinical Protocol CA209548
BMS-936558 nivolumab
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or no t considered related to the study 
drug.
The definition of immune-mediated AEs can be found in Section 0 .
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y treatment administration
(including SOC) and the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study treatment
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is eviden ce to suggest a causal relationship. 
In this study the relationship may be assessed to any component of the study treatm ent: radiation 
therapy, TMZ, and/or nivolumab/placebo.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC a nd FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)
•requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61807] s prolongation of ex isting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the  definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is  also considered an important 
medical event. (See  Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI)

Approved 8.0 v

Clinical Protocol CA209548
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE. 
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, a nd potential drug induce d liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be h andled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if death o ccurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE. (See Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215284]: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24  hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assessment requi ring admission for baseline/trending of h ealth status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth a nd planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical in tervention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)
−admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absenc e of any other SAEs 
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the s tudy, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associat ed with 
protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs, a nd all AEs (SAEs and non-serious AEs) associated with 
confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_259051] be collected that  relate to any later protocol-
specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy). For subjects  randomized and never treated with 
study drug, SAEs should be collected for [ADDRESS_259052] s regarding its seriousness.

If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to stud y drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative  section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not  related to study d rug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) within [ADDRESS_259053] be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregna ncy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is t hrough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when t he eCRF system is  not functioning. 
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email o r confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC) , electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the el ectronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].If only limited information is  initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initiall y reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted  within 24 hours to BMS 
(or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the  initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC a nd FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 a nd 320. A S[LOCATION_003]R  (Suspected, Unexp ected Serious Adverse 
Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appro priate regulatory authorities and 
investigators following local and global guidelines and require ments. 
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information (with the exception  of non-serious AEs related to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection) should begin at initiation of study drug. Nonserious AE information 
should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other observational period 
intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Protocol Amendment No.: 07

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinua tion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and  described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be trea tment-related) should be collected 
continuously during the tr eatment period a nd for a minimum of  [ADDRESS_259054]’s case report form.
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.[ADDRESS_259055] result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (electronic) as appropriate: Paper forms are only intended as a back-up

noted in the lo cally applicable package insert, summary of prod uct characteristics [SmPC] or 
similar document) of the last dose of TMZ s hould be  reported to Sponsor or designee. In order for 
BMS to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner, the female partner 
must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this infor mation. Information on this 
pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.[ADDRESS_259059] be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
•AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
•Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_259060], without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
•No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation a nd hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of ot her drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations

7 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL 
COMMITTEES
When required, adjudicated events will be submitted to the DMC and Health Authori ties for review 
on a specified timeframe in accordance with the adjudication do cumentation.
A Data Monitoring Committee w ill be established to  provide oversight of safety and eff icacy 
evaluation of the entire study and to provide advice to the sponsor regarding actions the committee 
deems necessary for the continuing protection of subjects. The DMC will be charged with 
assessing such actions in light of an acceptable benefit/risk p rofile for nivolumab. The DMC will 
act in an advisory capacity to BMS and w ill monitor s ubject safety and evaluate the available 
efficacy data for the study. The oncology therapeutic area of B MS has primary responsibility for 
design and conduct of the study. The DMC will meet at least eve ry 6 months or more frequently 
as needed on an ad-hoc basis. Information regarding DMC members hip, responsibilities, and 
procedures are detailed in the DMC charter. The DMC will be inf ormed should a safety signal 
emerge and may convene an ad-hoc meeting on its own initiative. The DMC will review all

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
This is a Phase 3, randomized, single blinded, multicenter stud y of RT + TMZ + nivolumab or 
placebo in adult ( ≥18 years) subjects with newly diagnosed GBM and MGMT-methylated  or 
indeterminate tumors.
The familywise type I error rate for the primary comparisons wi ll be set to 0.05, with 0.01 being 
allocated to the PFS comparison and 0.04 being allocated to the  OS comparison. 
The primary objectives of the study are:
•to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in an all-comers gro up of subjects with newly 
diagnosed MGMT-methylated or indeterminate GBM subtypes treated  with RT plus TMZ 
combined with ni volumab or placebo.
•to compare overall survival (OS) of subjects with newly diagnos ed MGMT methylated or 
indeterminate GBM subtypes without baseline corticosteroids and  regardless of baseline

corticosteroids (ie, all-comers) treated with RT plus TMZ combi ned with nivolumab or
placebo. 
These primary objectives on OS will test RT plus TMZ combined wit h nivolumab or placebo in 
the following hierarchy via a stratified log rank test: 
1) OS in newly diagnosed MGMT-methylated or indeterminate GBM su btype without baseline 
corticosteroids. 
2) If 1 is significant, OS in newly-diagnosed MGMT-methylated or  indeterminate GBM subtype 
regardless of baseline steroid use (all comers).
The sample size for this study is based on the following assump tions:
•PFS and OS follows exponential distribution
•Median PFS in RT+TMZ arm is 10 .0 months
•Hazard ratio (HR) of arm RT + TMZ + nivolumab vs RT + TMZ for PFS is 0 .68, translated to 
median PFS improvement of 4.7 months (10.0 months vs 14.7 months  for arm RT + TMZ and 
arm RT + TMZ + nivolumab, respectively)
•Median OS in RT+TMZ arm is 26.0 months54
•Hazard ratio (HR) of arm RT + TMZ + nivolumab vs RT + TMZ is 0.7 for t he randomized 
population with no baseline corticosteroi d, translated to media n OS improvement of 11.1 
months (26.0 months vs 37.1 months for arm RT + TMZ and arm RT + TM Z + nivolumab, 
respectively)
•Hazard ratio (HR) of arm RT + TMZ + nivolumab vs RT + TMZ is 0.75 for  the overall 
randomized population, t ranslated to median OS improvement of 8 .7 months (26.0 months vs 
34.7 months for arm RT + TMZ and arm RT + TMZ + nivolumab, respectivel y)
•Proporti on of no baseline corticosteroid population within the entire newly-diagnosed MGMT-
methylated or indeterminate GBM subtypes is 0.70
Approximately 693 subjects w ill be ra ndomized in a 1:1 ratio, str atified by [CONTACT_215331]. Of these 693 subjects, 485 subjects are assumed to be  no baseline corticosteroids. 
Accrual is estimated to take approximately 25 months based on an  observed monthly accrual in 
CA209548 of approximately 28 subjects per month; in the no base line corticosteroids population, 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_215285] 1, 4, 5, 8, 13, 16, 19, and then [ADDRESS_259061] 337 OS events (deaths) in the no baseline corticosteroid p opulation are needed to achieve 
88% power using a 2-sided Type 1 error of 4%. This number of ev ents is projected to occur after 
an additional 44 months of follow- up (ie, at 69 months). 
One interim analysis will be condu cted on OS in the  randomized pop ulation with no baseline 
corticosteroid. It will occur approximately 20 months after accru al is finished or when 70% or 236
OS events is reached which is estimated to occur at 45 months af ter study start, providing a 58%

at the planned number of events, the projected alpha level will  be 0.011 and 0.037. 
See Table 8.1-1 . The interim analysis will also be conducted on OS in the overa ll randomized 
population. The interim analysis w ill be conduc ted at the same time as the interim for the no 
baseline corticosteroids populat ion in a hierarchy with stoppin g boundaries at the interim and final 
analysis based on actual number of OS events at the time of the  analysis using Lan-DeMets alpha

The PFS comparisons will be based on first [ADDRESS_259062] 
404 PFS events are needed to achieve 90% power using a 2-sided T ype 1 error of 1%. Accrual is 
estimated to take approximately 23 months and this number of ev ents is proj ected to occur after 
an additional 12 months of follow-up (ie, at 35 months).
The technique of alpha-recycling will be used to adjust for mul tiplicity with details provided in 
the SAP.Power calculations were done using East v 6.3 and R.

on the actual number of OS event s at the time of the analysis u sing Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. For example, if the i nterim and final analyses occur 
exactly at the planned number of events, superiority of an arm will be declared if P ≤0.011 at the

by [CONTACT_215306] (complete or partial surgical resection at baseline).
PFS (based on BICR) will be analyzed in overall randomized subjects and all randomized subjects 
without baseline corticosteroids.
The CA209548 DMC c onvened on 09-Dec-[ADDRESS_259067] a pre-plann ed, routine safety review 
of all data. A lthough the init ial reco mmendation was that the study should continue unchanged 
and this was communicated to study investigators, subsequently the DMC notified BMS that they 
had deliberated further and unanimously agreed on the following :
•The OS data clearly shows that there is no plausible scenario f or this study to have a positive 
OS result at the final analysis based on either all ra ndomized patients or on patients without 
baseline corticosteroids. This statement is based on the DMC ̓s review of the OS results to 
date, with over 80% of the final required number of events reac hed and related statistical 
considerations including conditional power of < 1% for a statis tically significant final result.
•While the group receiving nivolumab has a higher incidence of toxicities, the DMC members 
believed the increased toxicity was expected and did not warran t stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_215287] b ecause 
of safety.
The DMC recommended to unblind the sites and subjects, which wa s approved by [CONTACT_20444]. The study 
was unblinded to investigators on 22-Dec-2020. As a consequence, the timing of the primary OS 
analysis, originally planned for when 337 and 494 events were t o be reached respectively for the 
population without cor ticosteroids at bas eline and th e overall population, has be en updated. To 
prevent any bias due to unblinding of subjects, the primary OS analysis will be conducted using 
the cut-off date (or LPLV) of 22-Dec-2020, which is when the study  was unblinded.
The primary OS analysis in all rando mized sub jects without baseline corticosteroids and the 
primary PFS analysis in all randomized subjects will report a p -value as planned in the alpha 
recycling plan. Overall survival in all randomized subjects wil l be tabulated descriptively, as 
described in the current SAP. Potential subsets analyses will b e presented descriptively. The 
primary analysis of PFS per BICR will be conducted using the cu t-off date of 14-Jun-2019 with a 
database lock date of 09-Aug-2019 (the primary PFS analysis ass essed by [CONTACT_215334] 2019). The 
same analysis will also be conducted using the cut-off date of 22-Dec-2020.
Based on CP calculation (< 1%) for OS, there is no plausible sce nario for this study to have a 
positive OS result. Therefore, only selected analyses will be inc luded in the primary Clinical St udy 
Report, as described in the current SAP.

Term Definition
Complete 
AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. This also means that abstinence is the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. This does not mean  periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acc eptable alternate methods 
of highly or less effective contraception’s must be discussed i n the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.

APPENDIX 2 RADIATION THERAPY GUIDELINES
Radiation therapy for GBM contri butes importantly to both effic acy and toxicity. Modern 
radiotherapeutic management of GBM was recently summarized: Niyazi  M, et al. (2016) 
ESTRO-ACROP guideline “target delineation of glioblastomas”. Radiother Oncol 118:35-42.
A high level of experience is assumed in participating centers.  Guidelines are provided in order 
to support appropriate homogeneity in a trial environment witho ut imposing excessive 
constraints on expert practice. Therefore, the following guideli nes should be interpreted as 
expectations rather than protocol requirements.
Dose Specification 
A total dose of 60 Gy, in 2 Gy daily fractions on 5 days/week, will be administered in 6 weeks 
(30 fractions). Radiation treatment duration may be extended du e to delays or holidays up to 
7 weeks (49 calendar days). 
Radiation treatm ent will be delivered with a megavoltage machine w ith photon energy ≥6 MV
utilizing either 3-D Conformal or Intensity-Modulated (IMRT or VM AT) approaches. Electron, 
particle, or implant boost is not permitted.
An initial target volume (see below definitions) will be irradia ted to [ADDRESS_259079] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_215292], eg, thermoplastic 
mask) is standard. Fusion with MR images for target and OAR del ineation is mandatory. 
Target volumes will be based upon post-operative contrast-enhanc ed MRI, although 
pre-operative imaging should be used for c orrelation, and may be modified based on subsequent 
scans if anatomic shift is evident. The method of dose volume p lanning and documentation 
should be not be investigational.
The initial gross tumor volume (GTV1) is defined by [CONTACT_28261] T2 or the FLAIR abnormality, 
including enhancing tumor volume and surgical cavity. The boost  volume (GTV2) will be based 
on the T1-enhancing tumor volume plus the surgi cal cavity. Derived clinical target volumes 
(CTV1-2) are the corresponding GTV plus a margin of approximatel y 2 cm; smaller margins are 
permitted, based on clinical judgment and anatomic constraints.  Planning target volume 
(PTV1-2) margins, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a pproximately 0.[ADDRESS_259080] 95% of the planned CT V shall receive 100% of the 
prescribed dose, with acceptable variance of 90% PTV coverage fo r clinical or technical reasons.
Isodose distributions must be recorded. Details of field modific ation will be determined by [CONTACT_215335]-accepted practice based on  primary tumor extension, natural 
structures and organs at risk (eg, optic chiasm or brainstem), as well as on re producibility 
considerations, potential overlap regions and the like.

Protocol Amendment No.: 07
Date: 02-Sep-[ADDRESS_259082] agree to use one highly effective m ethod of contraception as listed 
below. Local laws and regulations may require use of alternativ e and/or additional contraception 
methods.
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate o f < 1% when used consistently 
and correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to 
use one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed  below. Male subjects must inform 
their female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requir ements of the protocol and are 
expected to adhere to using contraception with their partner. C ontraception methods are as 
follows:1) Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhib ition of ovulation.
2) Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptiv e pi[INVESTIGATOR_122351] + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants an d intrauterine devices (IUDs) 
such as Mirena ®
3) Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard ®
4) Bilateral tubal occlusion
5) Vasectomised partner with documented azoospermia 90 days afte r procedure
♦Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method  provided that partner is 
the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that  the vasectomised partner 
has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
6) Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).7) Complete abstinence
♦Complete abstinence is defined as the complete avoidance of het erosexual intercourse 
(refer to Glossary of Terms)
♦Complete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study d rugs and must 
be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus 5 half-lives of the 
investigational drug plus 30 days).
♦It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception wh en complete abstinence is 
elected.
♦Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have p regnancy tests, as 
specified in Section 5.
♦Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
♦The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in r elation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the sub ject.

APPENDIX 5 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for Protocol Amendment 06, 26-Feb-2021
The CA209548 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) convened on 09-Dec -[ADDRESS_259083] udy investigators, 
subsequently the DMC notified BMS that they had deliberated further and unanimously agreed 
on the following:
•The overall survival (OS) data clearly shows that there is no plausible scenario for this stud y 
to have a positive OS result at the final analysis based on eit her all randomized patients or on 
patients without baseline corticosteroids. This statement is ba sed on the DMC’s review of the 
OS results to date, with over 80% of the final required number of events reached and related 
statistical considerations including conditional power of < 1% for a stati stically si gnificant 
final result.
•While the group receiving nivolumab has a higher incidence of toxicities, the DMC members 
believed the increased toxicity was expected and did not warran t stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_215287] b ecause 
of safety.
The DMC recommended to unblind the sites and patients, which wa s approved by [CONTACT_20444]. The 
study was unblinded to investigators on 22-Dec-2020. As a conse quence, the timing of the 
primary OS analysis, originally planned for when 337 and 494 ev ents were to be reached 
respectively f or the populati on without corticosteroids at baseline and the overall populati on, has 
been updated. To prevent any bias due to unblinding of patients , the primary OS analysis will be 
conducted using th e cut-off date (or last patient last visit [LPLV]) of 22-Dec-2020, which is 
when the study was unblinded.
Following unblinding, study subjects who were currently on nivol umab therapy, tolerating the 
treatment, and were considere d by [CONTACT_215336]. However, study procedures in the treat ment and follow-up phases are 
now simplified, since additiona l post-unblindi ng data are no longer needed for analyses.
Protocol languages per BMS standards for nivolumab studies and for COVID-[ADDRESS_259084] also been 
incorporated.

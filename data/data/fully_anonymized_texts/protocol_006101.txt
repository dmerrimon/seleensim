ABSTRACT  
Recurrent pediatric brain and solid tumors, especially high- grade gliomas (HGG), have few effective 
treatments and are a major source of mortality in pediatric oncology. XPO1  (CRM1 ) is a nuclear export 
protein that selectively transports  tumor supp ressor  (TSP) and growth regulatory  (GRP) proteins out of the  
nucleus , effectively inhibiting their function . Selinexor ( KPT -330), a novel small molecule, slowly 
reversible inhibitor of XPO1, is the first- in-class Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE). Selinexor 
causes the retention, accumulation , and activation of TSP/GRP in the nucleus , which  in turn induce cell 
cycle arrest wherein neoplastic cells with  genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage undergo 
apoptosis. Selinexor has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in multiple pediatric cancer models, including 
intracranial xenografts of HGG. In phase [ADDRESS_771457] 2 proteasome inhibitors, 2 
immunomodulatory agents, and an anti -CD38 monoclonal antibody. Selinexor has also demonstrated 
promising preliminary clinical activity in acute myeloid leukemia, glioblastoma  multiforme (GBM), 
sarcoma, and other solid tumors. We will conduct a phase 1  trial of selinexor in children with recurrent  
brain and solid tumors  using the Rolling Six design. The aims of the trial will be to establish the maximum 
tolerated  pediatric  dose of selinexor ; to investigate the  toxicities,  pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics 
of selinexor in children with these tumors ; and to preliminarily  explore efficacy  in pediatric solid and CNS 
tumors, including medical and surgical expansion cohorts of HG G patients .

and progression of carcinogenesis. The  majority of the tumor suppressor (TSP) and growth 
regulatory (GRP) proteins mediating these pathways act in the cell nucleus.  Accumulating 
data suggest that in order to maintain their malignant behavior, neoplastic cells must 
inactivate most or all of th e known TSP and GRP pathways.1 Active nuclear export of 
TSP/GRP is one very efficient and rapid means of overcoming normal cell cycle regulation and the genomic stability assessment mediated by [CONTACT_37400].  
 
Essentially all known TSP/GRP utilize a single non -redundant nuclear  export protein 
complex to exit the nucleus.  Exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as  chromosomal region 
maintenance protein 1 (CRM1), is the primary component of this export complex, and is 
overexpressed in man y types of cancer .
[ADDRESS_771461] majority of the TSP and GRP.  XPO1  
“recognizes” most of these  cargo proteins for nuclear export through canonical Nuclear 
Export Sequences (NES) in the cargo protein.  These NES are often buried within the cargo 
proteins and only unmasked when cells receive specific signals from their environments.  
XPO1  itself has a very specific cargo -binding groove that allows it to accommodate a 
diverse array of N ES-bearing proteins.[ADDRESS_771462] RNAs are exported by [CONTACT_586357].4 
 
Human cancers frequently overexpress XPO1  and/or show inappropriate cytoplasmic 
expression of TSP/GRPs,  suggesting dysfunctional nuclear -cytoplasmic transport. XPO1  
is upregulated in a range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies , including high -
grade glioma,  and its overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting that 
alterations in nuclear -cytoplasmic transport, and hence mislocalization of tumor suppressor 
proteins, cell cycle regulators, and/or pro -apoptotic proteins, could promote oncogenesis 
and resistance to chemotherapy . 5-9 
 
Selinexor  is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) that binds and inactivates XPO1  
in a reversible manner , thereby [CONTACT_586358]/GRP .  Transient 
retention of TSP/GRP in the nucleus at high levels via XPO1  blockade activates cell cycle 
checkpoint and genomic surveying.  This leads to the death of nearly all types of malignant 
cells, whereas normal cells undergo transient cell cycle arrest and recovery when the export 
block is re leased.

stunning successes of modern medicine.  Overall, nearly 80% of children with cancer 
treated  in developed countries will be cured of their disease.[ADDRESS_771464] two decades.11  
The situation is especially dire in pediatric high -grade gliomas (HGG). HGG are defined 
as World Health Organization grade III and IV tumors of glial origin. They occur in both adults and children. Preclinical studies of selinexor in pediatric brain and solid tumors, 
combined with promising safety and efficacy data seen so far in adults, make selinexor an 
excellent candidate for use in this early -phase clinical trial in children with 
recurrent/progressive brain and solid tumors, who have few treatment options.

2.3.1 Antitumor Activity  in Pediatric Malign ancies  
XPO1  is overexpressed in osteosarcoma when compared to normal tissue and is 
associated with higher grade and inferior progression- free and overall survival 
rates.9 Similarly , in high- grade glioma (HGG), overexpression of XPO1  correlates 
with tumor grade and surviv al.7 Investigators from Dana- Farber and Columbia 
University recently published data showing dose -response curves in multiple  adult 
and pediatric primary human HGG lines to XPO1  inhibitors KPT -276, selinexor , 
and KPT -251.12 Cells in neurosphere culture in triplicate in 96 -well plates from 
each line were treated with a log -scale range of drug concentrations, from 0.1 nM 
to 100 uM, for a period of five days. Control cells were treated with DMSO alone.  
Survival was measured using the CellTiter Blue assay. IC 50 values fell within a 
narrow, sub- micromolar range  as seen in figure 1 (with 95% CI).  
Figure 1:  
 
Three groups of [ADDRESS_771465]

The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) also recently tested selinexor  
against their panel of pediatric cell lines both in vitro and in vivo  (Houghton PJ et 
al, AACR Annual Meeting 2013, Poster LB -354) . The median relative IC 50 (rIC 50) 
was 125 nM (range 13 nM to > 10 μM), with a trend for greater sensitivity for the 
Ewing sarcoma cell lines (median rIC 50 = 57 nM) and lesser sensitivity for the 
neuroblastoma cell lines (median rIC 50 = 235 nM). In subcutaneous murine 
models, selinexor was administered at 10 mg/kg orally on a 3- day/week schedule 
(M-W-F) for 4 weeks with a total treatment/observation period of 6 weeks.

selinexor showed tumor regression in 3 of 38 (4%) solid tumor xenografts, 
including a maintained complete response (MCR ) in a Wilms (1 of 3), a CR in a 
slow growing ependymoma (1 of 2) and a CR in a medulloblastoma (1 of 2) 
xenograft. Tumor growth inhibition meeting criteria for intermediate or high 
activity was demonstrated  in 11 of 32 (34%) of the solid tumor panel, mos t 
frequently for the Wilms (2 of 3) and Ewing sarcoma (4 of 5) models.13 
Investigators at th e Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP) have 
demonstrated that XPO1 mRNA expression is higher in neuroblastoma cell lines 
and MYCN  amplified primary tumors when compared to low -risk tumors. They 
tested a panel of 17 neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro  over a 5 -log range of 
selinexor.14 All cell lines tested were sensitive to selinexor with IC 50 values ranging 
from 51- 568 nM.  While the in vivo  models of the PPTP showed progressive 
disease in six neuroblastoma models with selinexor at 10 mg/kg MWF, the data 
from CHOP show objective responses at higher selinexor doses. Flank xenografts 
of the neuroblastoma cell line SH -SY5Y showed tumor size reduction after oral 
administration of selinexor  at 15 mg/kg MWF. Perhap s more importantly, 
resistance was not observed. After allowing the tumors to grow following 28 days 
of drug withdrawal, re -exposure to the drug again showed growth suppression 
(Figure 3).  Selinexor  was also tested in a model of disseminated neuroblastoma 
created by [CONTACT_586359] a luciferase- expressing SH -SY5Y line. Tumor 
growth was monitored by [CONTACT_586360] (Figure 4A). Mice treated with selinexor (15 mg/kg MWF) showed 
suppression of tumor growth (Figure 4B) and prolonged survival. Liver metastases 
harvested at necropsy showed decreased Ki -67 and increased caspase- 3 staining in 
treated tumors as compared to controls. Similar results were seen with the IMR5 
and Be2c neuroblastoma cell lines. 14-16

leukem ia models. The dosing regimen was every other day x 3 each week 
(QoDx3/wk); anti -tumor activity has also been shown with twice weekly dosing. 
Efficacy was demonstrated at doses of 15 -60 mg/m2 (5-20 mg/kg) in mouse models 
of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T -ALL) xenografts. Moreover, e fficacy, 
including significant survival advantages, was demonstrated in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) [MV4 -11 (FLT3 -ITD)], chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis 
(CML -BC), and T- ALL leukemografts.15,16 
 
2.3.2 Animal Toxicology  
Sprague- Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys were chosen as the toxicology 
species for the selinexor nonclinical safety program.  In both species, the primary 
effects of selinexor were dose -dependent reductions in food intake and body 
weight (or reductions in body weight gain), with minimal clinical symptoms (no 
or mild non- bloody diarrhea), associated primarily with gastrointestinal atrophy.  
Similar effects are observed in mice and dogs given selinexor and related SINE 
compounds.  Increases in amylase and/or lipase, ALT (with less effects on AST), 
CK, and LDH were observed, but generally were not indicative of organ failure across species.  Dose- dependent lymphocyte depletion in lymphoid organs was 
observed, with alterations in blood hematology parameters generally considered to be clinically insignificant. In summary, dose limiting toxicity (DLT)/mortality in 
both rats and monkeys is related primarily to marked weight loss at high  repeated 
doses of selinexor with atrophy of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and noncritical 
effects on other major organs.    
In rats, DLT was related to subacute progressive weight loss and GI tract atrophy 
across all of the studies.  Acute single PO gavage doses of selinexor at up to 3,000 
mg/m
2 (500 mg/kg) showed no mortality at up to [ADDRESS_771467]-dose.  There were 
dose-dependent reductions in food and water intake and body weight, and non-
bloody diarrhea was observed.  Clinically significant changes in serum chemistry 
(LFTs, CK, LDH) were observed at the highest dose tested, with no clin ically 
significant changes in h ematolog ical or coagulation parameters.  Gross necropsy 
showed thinning of the gastrointestinal wall . Monkeys showed similar DLTs as 
observed in rats, namely dose -dependent weight loss associated with reduced food 
intake that were both rapi[INVESTIGATOR_1920] . Animals that had >7.5% body weight loss 
were given Ensure® and additional food supplements during the study.  The body 
weights of the recovery group animals returned to approximately baseline levels by [CONTACT_283656] (two weeks) and substantial recovery had already 
occurred by 4 -5 days after dosing.  
No CNS -related adverse side effects and no microscopic changes in the brain were 
observed in the rat and monkey Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), 4- week toxicity 
studies. However, in monkeys at doses >72 mg/m
2,  marked rapid weight loss was 
observed and associated with abnormal muscle movements and histopathological 
changes in the cerebellar granular neurons and inner cell nuclear layer of the eye.  
No CNS -related toxicities observed after a single dose of selinexor or repeated 
doses <72 mg/m2 in the monkey.  Doses of 300 mg/m2 in rats were also associated 
with cerebellar granular neuron changes without any CNS behavioral changes 
(Irwin test). The dose that resulted in 10% mortality over the duration of the study 
(STD10) in rats was >30 mg/m2, and the highest non- severely toxic dose (HNSTD) 
in monkeys was 18 mg/m2.16

Selinexor has been studied at 10 µM in an in vitro  selectivity assay including 
receptors, kinases, and cysteine proteases (including caspases and matrix 
metalloproteinases), with none of the targets significantly affected by [CONTACT_586361] B (MAO -B; binding IC 50 of >5 µM and minimal 
functional activity).  Given the minimal inhibition of human Ether -à-go-go Related 
Gene (hERG) tail current density (hERG IC50) for selinexor is 20.[ADDRESS_771468] period, and on all animals assigned to 
the study during the final dosing cycle (1- [ADDRESS_771469] dose on Day 21) and during 
the last week of the recovery period on Day 39.  There was no ECG evidence of a direct or indirect effect of selinexor on the morphology and intervals of the ECG 
at up to 36 mg/m
2 (3 mg/kg).  Based on these results, QT prolongation or other 
cardiac effect does not appear to be a safety concern for selinexor.  
 
Selinexor was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test.  
 
No preclinical toxicity studies in juvenile animals have been performed. Please 
refer to the Investigator’s brochure for full details of preclinical toxicology studies . 
  
2.3.3 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies  
Preclinical PK parameters were assessed in three species: mouse (CD1), rat 
(Sprague- Dawley), and monkey (cynomolgus). Oral bioavailability (F%) of 
selinexor was remarkably consistent among the three species, with average values 
of 66.5%, 61.2%, and 67.5% i n mice, rats, and monkeys, respectively.  Protein 
binding of selinexor was high in all species (>90%).  Overall, systemic exposure 
was generally dose- proportional in all studies that involved multiple dose levels.   
No accumulation was observed. The drug unde rwent minimal metabolism in vitro 
by [CONTACT_586362] S9 fraction ; 
the major product of metabolism is GSH conjugation, with the formation of inactive metabolites including N -acetylcysteinyl - and cysteinyl -derivatives . 
Selinexor showed no significant in vitro interactions with any of the cytochrome 
P450 (CYP450) enzymes ( i.e., IC
50 >10 µM), except for one sub strate of CYP3A4 
(testosterone) which displayed an IC 50 of 4.7 µM (the IC 50 for midazolam, the other 
CYP3A4 substrate, was >10 µM). No induction of CYP450 activity was observed for CYP1A2 or CYP3A4. 
 
Higher C
max and earlier T max values were observed in monkeys that were fasted 
versus fed prior to dosing.  Systemic exposure (AUC last) was not affected by [CONTACT_511683]. D elivery of drug product was studied using gelatin 
capsules and suspension. When cynomolgus monkeys were given a suspen sion 
formulation by [CONTACT_127450], exposure increased by 40%, and C max increased 
threefold versus capsule dosing.  Assessment of brain penetration two hours after 
single oral dosing of selinexor revealed brain:plasma ratios averaging 0.[ADDRESS_771470] techniques and allometric scaling the predicted human clearance of selinexor is 227 ml/h/kg, or 
approximately half the clearance rate observed in monkeys. Thus, the predicted exposure in humans is not expected to significantly vary from that observed in 
monkeys. Anticancer activity is anticipated  at doses of 15- 45 mg/m

doses, C max is expected to be 0.9-2.8 μM. 17 
 
2.4 Adult Studies  
In phase 1 clinical trials in adults with advanced solid or hematological malignancies 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Selinexor was  administered to over 
240 patients. The dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) on the initial solid tumor trial were 
anorexia/nausea/dehydration and fatigue at 40 mg/m2 (10 times per 4- week cycle; Days 1, 
3, 5 of weeks 1 & 3 and Days 1 & 3 of weeks 2 & 4). The MTD and recommended phase 
2 dose (RP2D) for 10 times per cycle dosing is 30 mg/m2.  Reduced intensity dosing at 
twice weekly (8 times per cycle, Days 1 & 3 of each week) has shown improved 
tolerability, with an approximately 50% reduction in the observed rate of adverse effects. One of 6 patients at a dose of 35 mg/m
2 on the twice weekly schedule experienced a DLT 
of Gr ade 3 nausea, vomiting and fatigue; this patient also experienced concomitant C. 
difficile  infection . 18  Dose escalation cleared  the 40 mg/ m2, 50 mg/m2 and 65 mg/m2 level s 
without DLT, but there were 2 DLTs at 85 mg/m2: hyponatremia and reversible cerebellar 
syndrome. Based on these results,  MTD and RP2D of selinexor twice weekly is determined 
to be 65 mg/m2. [ADDRESS_771471] common grade 1/2 AEs were nausea (78%), fatigue (70%) and anorexia (68%) 
vomiting (60%).  Other toxicity included dysgeusia, diarrhea, dehy dration, and weight loss.  
Aggressive supportive care, including prophylactic administration of appetite stimulants and anti -nausea agents, improves tolerability , 
20 and symptoms abate with time. Idiopathic 
reductions in platelets (10 -20% Grade ≥ 3) have been observed but without clinically 
significant bleeding; anemia and neutropenia have been minimal. Patients have reported 
blurred or diminished vision, but without objective findings on ophthalmological 
examination. Dehydration was determined to be responsible for at least some of the 
instances of blurred vision.  There were [ADDRESS_771472] to determine, as phase 
1 patients tend to be older  and very heavily pre -treated with chemotherapy and 
dexamethasone. Because it is impossible to exclude selinexor as a cont ributing factor to 
worsening of cataracts, it is our recommendation that patients with pre -existing cataracts 
be excluded from the trial.  There has been evidence of clinical activity with disease stabilization ≥ 24 weeks in 
hormone- and chemotherapy- refra ctory prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, squamous head 
and neck cancer,  and endometrial sarcoma , and partial response s seen in a Kras mutant 
colorectal cancer, a BRAF  WT melanoma, and an ovarian cancer. 
21,19  
The ongoing hematologic malignancies phase 1 study includes patients with relapsed and  
refractory hematologic malignancies who enter the study with documented progressive disease. No DLTs were observed in the initial five cohorts at doses ranging from 16.8 to 
55 mg/m
2 on the 10 dose per 4- week cycle schedule.  On each of the 16.8 mg/m2 and 23 
mg/m2 dose levels, 1 of 6 patients had non-dose- limiting Grade 3/[ADDRESS_771473] common AEs were similar to those observed in patients with advanced metastatic 
solid tumors and were mainly gastrointestinal (GI) in nature. Escalation procee ded with the 
twice weekly schedule at dose levels 35  mg/m2, 45 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 level s without 
DLT . [ADDRESS_771474] occurred.25

(Amendment 4) On July 3, 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval to selinexor in 
combination with dexamethasone for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma who have received at least [ADDRESS_771475] 2 proteasome inhibitors, 2 immunomodulatory agents, and an anti -CD38 
monoclonal antibody. Approval was based on a subgroup analysis of 83 heavily pretreated 
patients enrolled on the STORM trial  (KCP -330- 012; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and treated with  80 
mg selinexor ( 45 mg/m2) in combination with dexamethasone on D ays 1 and 3 of each 
week. O verall response rat e was 25.3% (95% CI: 16.4, 36) with a median response duration 
of 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.3, not estimable). Adverse events reported in at least 20% of 
patients include thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, anemia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, diarrhea, vomiting, hyponatremia, neutropenia, leukopenia, constipation, dyspnea, 
and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] .
[ADDRESS_771476] recently  opened or are in the late 
planning stages.  In the phase 2, two- tier KING study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of single -agent selinexor in patients with recurrent  GBM  after failure 
of radiation therapy and temozolomide, designed to start at 50 mg/m
2, nearly half of 
patients enrolled  needed to de -escalate to 35  mg/m2 during the first 8- dose cycle due to 
anorexia, nausea, dehydration and fatigue . The study was subsequently amended to begin 
at 35 mg/m2 (60 mg flat dosing) twice weekly and to study 45 mg/m2 (80 mg flat dosing) 
given once weekly. Both amended dosing schedules showed improved tolerability and 
similar efficacy. Investigators have reported results showing a 30% 6 cycle PFS rate and a 
10% overall  response rate at the 45 mg/m2 weekly dosing.27 No Grade 3 or 4 non-
hematologic adverse events were reported  on this arm; out of 30 subjects, Grade 3 
neutropenia developed in 3 patients, and Grade 3 leukopenia, Grade 3 lymphopenia, and 
Grade 4 lymphopenia developed in 1 patient each.    
2.4.1 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
Detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses suggest a 
fairly proportional increase in C max and AUC with increasing dose, with no 
accumulation and without affecting half- life or clearance. At 30 mg/m2, AUC 0-last. 
(4375 ng*h/mL) was comparable to the anti -tumor exposure observed in mice and 
dogs. T max (~3 h) and T 1/2 (6-7 h) were consistent across doses. Selinexor undergoes 
moderately rapid oral absorption, with median time to maximal plasma levels (T
max) of 1 -8 hours. The volume of distribution is 1.5 -2.5 L/kg, indicating  good 
distribution to tissues beyond the central (vascular) compartment. The primary metabolic route is glucuronidation and hydroxylation of the parent drug. In addition, GSH conjugates with selinexor to form inactive metabolites including N-
acetylcysteiny l- and cysteinyl -derivatives. Selinexor is not metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]450. 
 
Significant increase (2 -20x) in XPO1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels 
in circulating leukocytes was observed at all doses, with higher doses demonstrating higher levels of XPO1 mRNA induction. Analysis of tumor 
biopsies confirmed nuclear localization of TSPs (e.g., p53, FOXO3A, IκB) and 
apoptosis of cancer cells following selinexor administration.
28  
As part of KCP -330- 002 (the adult Solid Tumor phase 1), one patient (043-013) 
with mandibular cancer received selinexor through a feeding tube by [CONTACT_586363]. This patient exhibited rapid selinexor

absorption, with an AUC 0-inf  of 4,520 ng*h/mL  and C max of 1,150 ng/mL.  While 
exposure for patient 043- 013 was similar to the mean exposure for the other 16 
patients in the trial treated at 30 mg/m2 with oral  capsules, C max was [ADDRESS_771477] study in patients with sarcomas

take the medication with food, regardless of fat content, versus the fasting state.
[ADDRESS_771478] then been allowed to 
resume oral selinexor after recovery (1 to 5 weeks after surger y). There have been 
no adverse effects associated with this pre and post -operative administration of 
selinexor, including on wound healing (personal communication, Andrew 
Lassman). Studies on this tissue include d measurement of intra- tumoral drug 
levels, as well as other assays examining pharmacodynamic effect of selinexor on 
tumor cells , including induction of apoptosis, and XPO1 mRNA and protein levels . 
Preliminary data from 7 patients showed that selinexor reached therapeutic 
concentrations of ~50- 300 nM  within brain tumor tissues, with a median plasma 
concentration of 122 nM in adult GBM after ~2 hours.29 
 
2.5 Pediatric Studies  
 
2.5.1 Prior Experience in Children (Updated with amendment 4):  
In a pediatric Phase 1 trial of selinexor in children with recurrent/progressive 
leukemia run through the Dana -Farber Leukemia Consortium  (DFCI) , the 
recommended P hase 2 dose was determined to be  40 mg/m2 twice weekly, 8 doses 
in a 28 day cycle.30 Two DLTs were encountered: pancreatitis (30  mg/m2) and 
cognitive disturbance (56  mg/m2). Single agent activity was noted with an ORR of 
12.5% [1 CRp (AML), 1 PR (ALL)] and [ADDRESS_771479]. Jude Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586331] (D ays 1, 3, 8, 10, 22, and 24) with 
fludarabine and cytarabine  (Days 15 through 19 ) for treatment of refractory or 
relapsed leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, the MTD of selinexor was 55 
mg/m2.31 The dose -limiting toxicity at 70 mg/m2 was reversible cerebellar toxicity , 
but at and above 40 mg/m2, all patients treated demonstrated evidence of XPO1 
target inhibition .31  
 
2.5.2 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative Biological Studies  
The below table depi[INVESTIGATOR_586332] 30 mg/m2 twice weekly with selinexor. The data shows that 
pharmacokinetic parameters observed in pediatric patients (n=4) at 30 mg/m2 are 
comparable to those observed in adult patients administered wi th the same 
selinexor dose.

2.[ADDRESS_771480] a phase 1 trial of selinexor in children with recurrent or refractory  solid 
tumors , including CNS tumors  using the Rolling Six design. The aims of the trial will be 
to establish the maximum tolerated pediatric doses of tablet formulation; to investigate the 
toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of selinexor in children with cancer; 
and to preliminarily explore efficacy in pediatric solid and CNS tumors, including medical 
and surgical expansion cohorts of HGG patients.  
 
After the  recommended Phase 2 dose has been determined on the dose- escalation portion 
Part A , Parts B and C will open concurrent ly. During the initial cohort, patients receive d 
selinexor twice weekly (once on each day) on a days 1, 3 schedule (Mon/ Wed ,Tue/Thurs, 
or Wed/Fri ). One cycle was 28 days or 8 doses. Due to unanticipated hematological toxicity 
the schedule was revised (Amend ment #1 April 2016) and subsequent patients received  
selinexor twice weekly (once on each day) on a days 1,3 schedule (Mon/Wed ,Tue/Thurs, 
or Wed/Fri ) during weeks 1 -3, followed by a 7 day break . One cycle w as 28 days or 6 
doses.  With Amendment #[ADDRESS_771481] of selinexor 
given once a week for 4 doses.  
 Toxicity will be assessed using CTCAE v5.0. Imaging for disease evaluation during the 
dose escalation phase will occur at the end of Cycle 1 , every other cycle x 2 , and every 3 
cycles thereafter. Disease response will be assessed according to RECIS T v1.1 criteria for 
solid tumors and 2- dimensional measurement for CNS tumors.  
 
2.7 Rationale for Change in Dosing Schedule (Amendment #1)  
Upon initiation of ADVL1414 Part A, 6 patients were enrolled at Dose Level 1, 35 mg/m2 
of selinexor by [CONTACT_586364] a days 1 and 3 schedule for 8 doses within a 28-
day course. Four patients completed course 1, were fully evaluable for toxicity for the purposes of dose escalation, and did not experience a DLT. Two patients were inevaluab le 
for DLT during cycle 1: one for a protocol deviation regarding the use of cyproheptadine, which has been addressed in this amendment, and one for having received a platelet

transfusion when platelets were at a grade 2 (53K) , wherein grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
(<50K) might have constituted a DLT.  In addition, one patient who did not experience a 
DLT during cycle 1, developed a grade 4 neutropenia during cycle 2 (a protocol defined 
DLT), which recurred after dose reduction, and subsequently required removal  from 
protocol therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_586333]. This observed hematologic toxicity was beyond that which was anticipated based on the data from previous adult trials.  
Selinexor is known to block megakaryocyte maturation. Neutropenia is rare.  According to 
the Investigator’s Brochure version 9.0, dated [ADDRESS_771482] 2019, the incidence of grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia in patients with solid tumors was 12% and the incidence of grade 4 
neutropenia was 0.3 % (34.7% and 6.4% respectively, when including patients with 
hematologic malignancy). In our recent discussions, the drug company, Karyopharm, 
provided new data from several adult trials in which it was noted that selinexor induced 
thrombocytopenia. The platelet nadir occurred after one cycle. The magnitude of 
thrombocytopenia was independent of dose occurring at selinexor doses of 30 -150 mg 
when given 2x wkly, for 7 -8 doses/28 cycle. The percent decrease in platelet count was 
relatively constant (~50%) regardless of baseline platelet count. In our discussions w ith 
Karyopharm, dose reductions for hematological toxicity in adult receiving selinexor were not standardized.  However, in review of data we concluded that interruption of selinexor therapy, and in cases of prolonged recovery (>3 weeks), decrease in dose frequency 
represent the optimal management for grade 3/[ADDRESS_771483], irreversible inhibition of the nuclear exporter XPO1 has been found to be highly toxic to normal cells, leading to the current requirement for intermittent dosing. The half -
life of selinexor is approximately six hours.  
 
2.8 Rationale for Change in Dosing Schedule (Amendment #4)  
Over 2,[ADDRESS_771484] received selinexor to date
 through numerous clinical trials for a 
variety of malignancies, both as a single agent and in combination.17 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_586334] 65 mg/m2/dose in adult single agent Phase 1 studies on the twice weekly 
(8 dose/ cycle) schedule, most studies are now using reduced doses of 35-45 mg/m2/dose 
due to analysis of safety and pharmacokinetic data showing acceptable efficacy and 
improved long- term tolerability . The most recent FDA approv al for multiple myeloma uses 
selinexor in combination with dexamethasone at the equivalent of 45 mg/m2/dose (80mg 
flat dosing) . Furthermore, it is clear from multiple adult trials of selinexor that weekly 
dosing, even at higher individual doses, reduces myelosuppression and neurotoxicity 
compared to twice weekly dosing. Positive results have been pres ented in patients with 
sarcoma,32 acute myeloid leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and others.  
 
In the P hase 2 trial of selinexor in recurrent glioblastoma (the KING trial), investigators 
have reported results showing a 30% 6 cycle PFS rate and a 10% overall response rate  
using the flat 80 mg weekly schedule  (equivalent to 45 mg/m2).[ADDRESS_771485] tolerated ; out of 30 subjects,  there were no non-
hematologic G rade 3/4 events,  Grade 3 neutropenia developed in 3 patients, and G rade 3 
leukopenia, G rade 3 lymphopenia, and Grade 4 lymphopenia developed in 1 patient each.  
                        ADVL1 414 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  19 
 
Investigators also demonstrated average intratumoral drug levels of 122 nM, on par with 
the in vitro IC 50 described in the preclinical studies in adult and pedi atric HGG.6  
 
Comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis between ADVL1414 and multiple adult 
studies suggest C max and AUC values at 20 mg/m2 were similar to those seen at 35 mg/m2 
dosing in adults, and values at 35 mg/m2 compared favorably to those seen at doses up to 
60 mg/m2 in adults. 35 mg/m2 dosing in children would therefore appear to produce at 
least equivalent PK values to the [ADDRESS_771486] responses in 
the KING trial, even when given weekly.  A dose of 20 mg/m2, on the other hand, is 
unlikely to produce adequate exposure for CNS tumor response, based on available clinical and preclinical data. Since progress in the trial to this point has demonstrated 20 
mg/m
2 twice weekly  (40 mg/m2 cumulative per week) to be tolera ble, we will use 45 
mg/m2 (a 12.5% increase in dose intensity) as our starting dose on the once weekly 
schedule which is anticipated to be less toxic than twice weekly dosing . We will have one 
dose escalation to 55 mg/m2 and one available de- escalation to 35 mg/m2, the lowest dose 
consider ed likely to  produce adequate CNS exposure to  be efficacious based on available 
evidence. We hypothesize that tolerability will be improved, that the RP2D for weekly 
dosing will be higher than the current RP2D for twice weekly dosing, and that C max and 
AUC values equival ent or higher will be achieved and compare favorably to the dosing 
levels in adults at which responses have been observed.

than seven (7) days at the start of therapy.  Laboratory tests need not be repeated if therapy starts 
within  seven (7) days of obtaining labs to assess eligibility .  If a post -enrollment lab value is outside 
the limits of eligibility, or laboratory values are older than [ADDRESS_771497] be re- checked within 48 hours prior to initiating therapy: CBC with differential, 
bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) and serum creatinine.  If the recheck is outside the limits of eligibility, the 
patient may not receive protocol therapy an d will be considered off protocol therapy. Imaging 
studies must be obtained within 14 days  prior to start of protocol therapy  (repeat the tumor imaging  
if necessary).   
 
 
Clarification in timing when counting days : As an example, please note that if the pat ient’s last day 
of prior therapy is September 1st, and the protocol requires waiting at least  7 days for that type of 
prior therapy, then that patient cannot be enrolled until September 8th.   
 
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be 
waived (per COG policy posted 5/11/01).  All clinical and laboratory data required for 
determining eligibility of a patient enrolled on this trial must be available in the patien t’s

Prophylactic treatment of nausea and emesis (such as 5 -HT3 antagonists  +/- 
another agent [e.g., dexamethasone, NK1 receptor antagonist, etc])  is strongly 
recommended during Cycles 1 and 2 (see Section 7.3 ). In adult patients, double 
antiemetic coverage (5HT3 antagonist + another agent) is preferred. If DLT of 
vomiting or dehydration is experienced in ≥ 2/6 evaluable patients at a dose level 
outlined in the dose level tables  above, the dose level will be repeated with required  
maximal  antiemetic therapy (5- HT3 antagonist PLUS antiemetic agent(s)) prior to 
each dose during Cycles [ADDRESS_771519] for all subseq uent 
patients entered at the same or higher dose level.  Dose levels which require 
antiemetic prophylaxis will be denoted with the suffix letter “A” (e.g. Dose Levels 
-1A, 1A, or 2A).    
 Selinexor is supplied by [CONTACT_586368]. Do not use commercial 
supply.  
 
5.3.2 Part B: Non-Surgical HGG Expansion Cohort

phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined from the phase 1 component (Part A) of this 
trial. 
 
5.3.3 Part C: Surgical HGG Expansion Cohort 
Patients with HGG requiring resection (Part C) will be treated at the recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D) determined from the phase 1 component (Part A) of this trial  
for 2 doses prior to undergoing scheduled resection of their tumors ( i.e. Surgical 
resection should occur after dose on Day 8 but before dose on Day 15 of Cycle 1) . 
After recovery from surgery  with wound healed (minimum 3 weeks)  and meeting  
criteria in Section 5.2 , patients can resume selinexor at the same dose and schedule 
and continue therapy  to complete Cycle 1 and continue with Cycle 2. Patients who

5.4 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can 
be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov /protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). Any 
suspected  or confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 
hours) to the Study Chair . 
 
5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to selinexor.  The DLT  observation period for the purposes of dose -escalation 
will be the first cycle of therapy.  
 Dose limiting hematological and non- hematological toxicities are defined differently.   
 
5.5.1 Non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity  
• Any Grade 4  non-hematological toxicity 
• Any Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the specific exception of: - Grade 3 nausea , vomiting , or dehydration that resolves to Grade ≤ 2 
within 3 days . For the purposes of this pediatric study, tube feeding 
should not be considered a Grade 3 DLT. See Section 7.3
 for supportive 
care guidelines. 
- Grade 3 anorexia . See Section 7.3  for supportive care guidelines  
- Grade 3 weight changes. See Section 7.3  for supportive care guidelines. 
- Grade 3 diarrhea tha t resolves to Grade ≤ 2 within 7 days  
- Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST/GGT that returns to 
levels that m eet initial eligibility criteria or baseline within 7 days . See 
Appendix VIII  for values that represent thresholds between CTCAE 
grades.  
- Grade 3 bilirubin  that returns to meet eligibility criteria within 7 days . 
See Appendix VIII  for values that represent threshold s between CTCAE 
grades.  
- Grade 3 infection of < 5 days duration 
- Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or asymptomatic hyponatremia re sponsive to oral 
supplementation 
• Fever greater than 40°C of ≥ 5 days duration  will be considered dose- limiting  
• Any ≥ grade 2 non-hematological toxicity that persists for ≥ 7 days and is 
considered sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolera ble by 
[CONTACT_586369] a cycle.  
• Any toxicity that requires treatment interruption as outlined in 
Sections 6.3- 
6.7 and does not resolve within the specified time frame will be considered 
dose- limiting.

6.1 Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.1.1 If a patient experiences Grade 4 neutropenia, selinexor should be held. Institute short acting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (filgrastim or biosimilar)  as 
per institutional guidelines.  Counts should be checked every 2 – 3 days until 
recovery to  Grade  < 2 or baseline and without fever (if febrile) and the patient is 
clinically stable. If this is a first occurrence, and myelosuppression has lasted < 7 
days, the patient may continue at the same dose. If lasting for > 7 days or this is a second occurrence resulting in a missed dose, reduce selinexor by 1 dose level. If 
the occurrence falls on Day 1 of a cycle, delay start of the cycle, institute short 
acting granulocyte colony stimulating factor as per institutional guidelines, and check neutrophils every 2 – 3 days until recovery to Grade < [ADDRESS_771521].   
 
6.1.2 If a patient experiences either Grade 4 or dose- limiting Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia as defined in Section 5.5.2 , selinexor should be held.  Counts 
should be checked every 2 – [ADDRESS_771522] recovered to meet eligibility to begin the next cycle. When resuming selinexor, reduce by 1 dose level. If the occurrence 
falls on Day 1 of a cycle, delay start of the cycle and check platelet counts every

6.3 Dose Modifications for Anorexia/Weight Loss 
 
6.3.1 Anorexia and weight loss are anticipated toxicities and should be proactively 
managed. If a patient experiences Grade 3 anorexia or weight loss , dosing should 
continue a s planned  and maximal supportive care (e.g . appetite stimulants , 
nutritional supplements, tube feeding) should be implemented as outlined in Section 7.3.1
. 
 
6.4 Dose Modifications for Nausea/Vomiting /Dehydration 
If a patient experiences Grade 3 nausea, vomiting , or dehydration, the treatment will be 
held. Patients should be treated with anti- emetic therapy as outlined in Section 7.3.2 . If 
toxicity resolves to Grade ≤ 2 nausea/vomiting/dehydration within 3 days, drug may 
resume at same dose. Grade 3 nausea, vomiting , or dehydration that persists  ≥ 3 days will 
be considered dose-limiting and require dose modification per Section 6.2 .

further supportive care with  acid suppression (proton pump inhibitors and/or H2- blockers), 
glucocorticoids, and other standard treatments should be administered as per institutional 
guidelines for symptomatic patients, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_586340].    
Below are recommendations based on the experience of the adult clinical trials and the  
DFCI pediatric leukemia trial  but do not represent required treatment approaches should 
the toxicities occur.  The administration of supportive care is as per institutional guidelines 
and the treating provider.  
7.3.1 Anorexia/Weig ht loss  
Selinexor treatment can lead to anorexia, decreased food intake with subsequent 
weight loss. Participants should be weighed at least weekly during study-required 
outpatient visits during cycle 1 and biweekly during cycles 2 and 3. If the patient 
is admitted for dehydration or malnutrition, more frequent weight assessment is 
recommended. It  is strongly recommended that patients receive ongoing 
nutritional assessment and dietary support consultation. Administration of high 
caloric beverages (e.g., Pediasure®) should be considered for all patients . The use 
of supplemental tube feeding is acceptable.  
 Patients who experience decreased food/liquid/caloric intake secondary to 
anorexia should have a patient log of food and drink with monitoring by [CONTACT_449818]. Fresh juices, simple carbohydrates, as well as ginger -containing 
foods and beverages can improve appetite.  
 Supportive care should be escalated for ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_771534] overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_586341], including sedation and dizziness. For pediatrics, the suggested starting dose of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_586342] 0.06 mg to 0.1 mg/kg for patients <  
10 years, 1.25 mg PO qPM  for patients 1 0 – 12 years old or 2.5 mg PO qPM for 
patients >  12 years old.
33 Patients who exhibit no response after 4 weeks, defined 
as no weight gain or further loss , may increase by 1.25 mg/day weekly to 
maximum 2.5 mg/day for children < 10 years, 5 mg/day for children ages 10 – 12, 
and 10 mg/day for children older than 12 years; use caution escalating olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_586343] 10 years. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_586344] a corticosteroid. Either dex amethasone < 0.25 mg/kg daily (max dose: 10 mg) 
or prednisone < 0.5 mg/kg daily ( max dose: 20 mg) is recommended on the days 
of, and 1 day after, selinexor dosing.  
Additional recommended agents are megestrol acetate (10 mg/kg/dose by [CONTACT_586370]; max dose: 800 mg/day) or cyproheptadine at a dose of 0.25 mg /kg/day 
orally in two divided doses and as second line. Dronabinol has also shown some 
activity in both nausea/emesis and anorexia in patients treated with selinexor.

and 10 mg/day for children older than 12 years; use 
caution escalating olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_586345] 10 years. 
• Consider addition of < 0.25 mg /kg (max 10 
mg/dose) dexamethasone or equivalent with each 
dose of selinexor +/- the day after selinexor.  
• Consider megestrol  acetate (10 mg/kg/dose by 
[CONTACT_16629]; max 800 mg/day ) or 
cyproheptadine at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day orally 
in two divided doses  
• Consider anabolic steroids such as oxandrolone, or 
dronabinol or other cannabinoid, mainly for patients who can’t tolerat e steroids or at high risk to 
progress.  See Section 6.3  
 
7.3.2 Nausea and Emesis  
Prophylactic treatment of nausea and emesis is strongly recommended during  
Cycle s 1 and 2 and will be  required for any d ose level with the suffix “A” (e.g. 
1A, 2A) . See https://childrensoncologygroup.org/downloads/COG_SC_CINV
_Guidelines_Document_Feb_2018.pdf  for COG -endorsed antiemetic guidelines. 
If not instituted prophylactically, antiemetic therapy should begin once there is any indication of nausea  as outlined in 
Section 6.4 .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Acute Emesis (occurring within 24 hours of administration of s elinexo r) 
Acute emesis has not frequently occurred with selinexor , but has been 
reported. Selinexor associated nausea/emesis generally responds to D2 -
antagonists (e.g.hydroxyzine) , 5-HT3 antagonists  (e.g. ondansetron) , or 
combinations of agents. 5- HT3 receptor antagonists all appear equally 
effective at preventing nausea/emesis at standard doses. The efficacy of [ADDRESS_771535], magnesium 
and potassium should be corrected prior to use. 
                        ADVL1 414 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  36 
 
 
Neurokinin- 1 receptor antagonists (e.g., aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) should be considered 
once uncontrolled emesis persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_586346]. Neurokinin- 1 receptor antagonists can 
be give n with combination of dexamethasone and 5- HT3 receptor 
antagonists.   
Additional treatment: Metoclopramide hydrochloride has been effective when given prior to meals (up to 4 times a day) in adult patients. 
Dronabinol has shown some activity in both nausea/ emesis and anorexia 
in patients treated with selinexor . Lorazepam can be added to the 
combination treatment of 5- HT3 receptor antagonists and dexamethasone, 
e.g., at night, but has been less effective in selinexor associated nausea and 
emesis.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Delayed Eme sis (occurring greater than 24 hours after administration of 
selinexor)  
Selinexor is infrequently associated with delayed, resistant emesis. Many 
of the regimens associated with delayed emesis are classified as high -
emetic risk, and professional guideline s recommend the use of an NK1 
receptor antagonist (either NK -1 blockers e.g., aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_508867] 1 to 3 or 
fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_508868] 1 only), plus a glucocorticoid on days [ADDRESS_771536] (particularly second generation agents) 
on day 1. This regimen is effective against both acute and delayed emesis.   
Conventional antiemetics are more successful at preventing emesis than in preventing nausea, particularly delayed nausea. As previously noted, i n 
adult studies, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_586347] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_586348]) was effective in both antiemetic and nausea 
control. It may also be useful for management of breakthrough emesis, and to improve food intake in patients with anorexia. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_586349] d nausea and vomiting , has not been 
thoroughly studied in children, and may have overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_586350], including sedation and dizziness. Guidelines for olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_586351] S ection 7.3.[ADDRESS_771537] been administered in the adult 
population: lorazepam, alprazolam, dopaminergic D2 -antagonists (eg, 
prochlorperazine, thiethylperazine, haloperidol), or substituting high-dose intravenous metoclopramide for the 5- HT3 antagonist. 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_771538] any clinical deficits shou ld be considered for blurred vision.

not accompanied by [CONTACT_586371]. However, a contribution of selinexor to blurred vision cannot be ruled 
out. 
 
 
7.3.6 Fatigue/Somnolence  
Fatigue has been noted as an adverse effect of selinexor in ad ult studies, and more 
significant fatigue, accompanied by [CONTACT_586372], has been noted in pediatric 
studies to date, potentially associated with cerebral edema.[ADDRESS_771540] -dosing has been an effective 
management to date. Consideration may also be given to the use of 
methylphenidate (I nitial: 0.3 mg/kg/dose PO  qAM . Maintenance: 0.3-1 mg/kg PO  
qAM ; maximum daily dose: 60 mg/ day).34,35 
 
7.4 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function can be used in the 
setting of Grade 4 neutrope nia and thrombocytopenia. The Study Chair  should be notified 
before growth factors are initiated.  
 
7.5 Concomitant Medications 
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary (see Section 7.3 ). Clinical evidence suggests that 
selinexor can be safely given with acetaminophen, but given the theoretical potential for GSH 
depletion , acetaminophen should not be taken within 2 hours of administration of selinexor, 
and it is recommended  that the total daily dose of acetaminophen should not exceed 20 mg/kg 
(maximum 1 gr am/day) on days of selinexor dosing.  
 
7.6 Part C  (HGG Surgical Expansion Cohort)  
For HGG patients who temporarily discontinue protocol therapy to undergo scheduled tumor 
resection, therapy may not be restarted  until wound healed  (minimum 3 weeks) and until 
recovery to eligibility requirements  (Section 4.0 ). Although patients will not be taking 
selinexor during the recovery period, platelets should be monitored as part of the twice weekly CBCs required during Cycle [ADDRESS_771541] -operative bleeding as per institutional standards. Failure to adequately 
recover from surgery within 6 weeks after surgery will require removal from  protocol 
therapy.

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
Strata : 
Part A:  Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors (Phase 1)  
 Part B:  Patients with relapsed or refractory HGG (excluding DIPG) who do not require 
resection  
Part C:  Patients with relapsed or refractory HGG for whom resection is required  
 
For Part A, a minimum of 2 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory so lid tumors 
including CNS tumors will be entered at each dose level for determination of MTD. Once 
the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose has been defined, up to 6 additional patients with 
relapsed/refractory solid tumors without restrictions on heme evaluabil ity may be enrolled 
                        ADVL1 414

to acquire PK data in a representative number of young patients (i.e. patients < 12 years 
old). A maximum of 29 patients is anticipated in this Part, assuming 6 evaluable patients 
are required for each dose level, 6 additional patients are needed for PK analysis, and a 20% inevaluable rate. Review of the enrollment rate into previous COG new agent studies 
indicates that 1-2 patients per month are available, which will permit completion of the 
study wi thin 15-29 months . In the unlikely ev ent that all dose levels require expansion to 
12 patients per Section 11.2.2
, then a maximum of 51 patients would be required allowing 
for a 20% inevaluable rate.  This would require about 26 -51 months for study completion. 
 
With Amendment #1, an additional 29 patients is anticipated for Part A, assuming 6 
evaluable patients are required for each dose level, 6 additional patients are needed for PK analysis, and a 20% inevaluable rate. The maximum accrual for the study (accoun ting for 
all parts of the study) will increase from 75 to 81 patients, assuming 20% inevaluability.  
Amendment #4 will require a minimum of 4 evaluable patients. The maximum is expected 
to be 30 allowing for 6 patients at each of three dose levels, 6 for PK, and 20% 
inevaluability. This is expected to be completed within 15- 30 months.  
 
However, a dose level will be repeated with required maximal antiemetic therapy (5 -HT3 
antagonists and another antiemetic ) prior to each dose during Cycles 1 and 2 i f DLT s of 
vomiting or dehydration is experienced in ≥ 2/6 evaluable patients at a dose level. This 
condition would increase the expected maximum to 38 which allows for 12 patients at one dose level, 6 at the two other dose levels, 6 PK, and 20% inevaluability. This would be expected to be completed within 19-38 months. 
 
In the unlikely event that all dose levels required expansion to 12 patients per 
Section 
11.2.2 , then the absolute maximum would be 68 patients. This includes 24 pat ients at a 
single dose level requiring expansion due to both 1) toxicities of different classes and 2) DLTs of vomiting or dehydration as well as 12 patients at each of the other two dose levels, 
6 PK, and 20% inevaluability. This would be expected to be completed within 34-68 
months. 
 
The study has currently enrolled 31 patients (Fall 2019 SPR). 
 
Non-Surgical Cohort (Part B): 10 evaluable patients with recurrent/progressive HGG 
(excluding DIPG) who do not require resection will be enrolled in a medical dos e-
expansion cohort (Part B) and will be treated at the MTD on the same schedule. If at any 
time greater than one out of three patients (or 33%) of the cohort of patients experience 
DLT, the cohort will be closed to further accrual. All patients enrolled on  Part A who meet 
the eligibility criteria for Part B of the study who are evaluable for response as outlined in Section 11.2.3
 of this protocol will be included in the evaluation rule . 
 
Surgical Cohort (Part C): Up to 10 evaluable patients with recurrent/progressive HGG 
(excluding DIPG and disseminated tumors) for whom resection is recommended by [CONTACT_586374] a surgical dose- expansion cohort. These patients will be 
allowed to receive up to four doses of selinexor prior to resection. After their resection and 
when medically cleared, they will restart selinexor on the prior schedule. The purpose of 
this cohort will be to perform pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies on the tumor 
tissue, and to explore preliminarily the effectiveness of selinexor in this disease.  If at any 
time greater than one out of three patients (or 33%) of the cohort of patients experience 
DLT, the cohort will be closed to further accrual.

Version Date: 11/10/2020  48 
 
 
Accrual to Parts B and C will only open once the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose has 
been determined in Part A, and may open concurrently with the PK expansion described 
above.   
A maximum of 24 patients are expected to enroll in Parts B and C  combined, as suming an 
inevaluability rate of 20% . We anticipate that each part of the study will require 6-[ADDRESS_771556] imaging done 4 weeks apart (See Section 12.6
). Sustained 
responses are very rare in this cohort of recurrent non- DIPG  HGGs . 36-[ADDRESS_771557] two MRs , is observed among 10 enrolled patients. A response rate of 
20% or more woul d be evidence of sufficient activity. If the true response rate is 20%, then 
the probability of observing one or more responses among 10 evaluable patients is about 
89.3%. If the response rate is 5%, then the probability of observing at least one response is 
about 40.1%.  
 
Clinical benefit for Part C  will be evaluated separately using the criteria of no visible 
disease progression six months from the start of treatment. If two or more of a cohort of up to six patients are unable to resume therapy within [ADDRESS_771558] one dose of th e study 
drug(s) and who experiences a dose -limiting toxicity  is considered evaluable for 
Adverse Events . In addition, for the dose -escalation portion (Part A), during Cycle 
1, patients must have the appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed to be 
considered evaluable for dose limiting toxicity. In Part A, patients who do not have 
DLT and do not  receive at least 5 out of 6 of the prescribed dose s (~85%)  within 
the first cycle for reasons other than toxicit ies (e.g. progressive disease) will not 
be considered evaluable for toxicity and will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose 
• The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience DLT (See Section 5.5
) during Cycle 1 of therapy.  
 
• In the unlikely event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepato toxicity and 
myelosuppression) AND all of the following conditions are met, expansion 
of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose- related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, 
and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  49 
 
If fewer than  1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose- limiting 
toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.  
 
• The DLTs  observed in the pharmacokinetic (PK) expansion cohort will be 
counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the MTD during the 
dose escalation portion of the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort of patients at the 
MTD (the dose escalation plus the PK expansion) experience DLT then the MTD will be exceeded.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_771559] one dose of selinexor will be considered evaluable for response provided: (1) the patient demonstrates progressive disease or death while on protocol 
therapy; or (2) the patient is observed on protocol therapy for at least one cycle and 
the tumor is not removed surgically prior to the time complete response or partial 
response is confirm ed, or (3) the patient demonstrates a complete or partial 
response as confirmed according to protocol criteria. Patients who demonstrate a complete or partial response confirmed by [CONTACT_586375] a response for the ap plication of the rule given in Section 11.[ADDRESS_771560] a response (CR , PR, or MR ) must have imaging studies reviewed centrally at 
the COG. Centers wi ll be notified by [CONTACT_586376]. See Section 8.[ADDRESS_771561] of this study.39  Two to six 
patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of 
patients enrolled at t he current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced 
DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability data pending at the current dose level.  Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has 
enroll ed or when the study endpoints have been met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity). For example, 
when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is available for all three when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and 
the fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is not yet available 
for one or more of the first three participants  and no DLT has been observed, or if one DLT 
has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if two or more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de- escalated. This process is repeated for 
participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de-
escalation rules have not been fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled 
onto the study.

11.5 Pharmacokinetic and Correlative Studies and Response Analysis  
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of selinexor  will be performed 
to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The 
PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, 
medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit).    
While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of selinexor , patients will 
have disease evaluations performed as indicated in Section 8.[ADDRESS_771563] imaging (see Section 12.6 ) or as >  [ADDRESS_771564] dos e without progressive disease, while clinical benefit in Part C  will be 
defined as no visible disease progression six months from the start of treatment.  Clinical 
benefit rate will be summarized separately for each of Parts B and C with 95% confidence intervals.   
 All these analyses  will be descriptive and exploratory  and hypotheses generating in nature .

12.2 Response Criteria for Patients w ith Solid Tumors  
See the table in section 8.0 for the schedule of tumor evaluations. In addition to t he 
scheduled scans, a confirmatory scan should be obtained on the next consecutive cycle  
following initial documentation of objective response. 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).[ADDRESS_771566]  diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of malignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria. 
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response : Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle [ADDRESS_771567] had their disease re- evaluated will b e considered evaluable for 
response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -
target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_771568] x- ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_771569] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_771570] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator 
thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_771571] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), in cluding 
small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis,  
                        ADVL1 414 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/[ADDRESS_771572] disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend the mselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A  sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each sh ould be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.2.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
                        ADVL1 414 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  54 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acce ptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_771573] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans). Ideally, the same type of sc anner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECI ST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  
If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytology, H istology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 
 Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional 
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at bas eline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow- up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow- up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow- up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly

of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow- up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an upta ke greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
 
12.2.4  Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non- target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <[ADDRESS_771574] be detected by [CONTACT_6777].  
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or o ther 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstr ate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non- target or non-
measurable disease, the patient  has PD  if there is 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non-
target disease such that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study

short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more  non- target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
norma lly trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
12.2.[ADDRESS_771576] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.7.[ADDRESS_771577] one dimension.  Such lesions may be evaluable by [CONTACT_166122], immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers or other reliable 
measures.   
 
12.3.2  Complete Response  
Disappearance of all evaluable disease.  
 
12.3.3  Partial response  
Partial responses cannot be determined in patients with evaluable disease  
 
12.3.4  Stable Disease (SD)  
That which does not qualify as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), 
or Progressive Disease.  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_771578] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best respons e” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.7.1  from a sequence of overall response assessments .

12.4.2 The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions 
Progressive disease: Development of new MIBG positive lesions 
 
12.4.3 The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2.1  for details on transferring images to the 
Imaging Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_6779].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra- osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
                        ADVL1 414 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  58 
 
 
 
The relative score is calculated by [CONTACT_99239] -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely  resolved. 
If morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6713], no tumor cells can be detected by [CONTACT_6783][INVESTIGATOR_6714] 21 
days apart to be considered a Complete Response. 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced). 
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_771580] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the overall response assessments as described in Table 5 in Section 12.8.1. 
 
 
12.5 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
12.5.1  Bone Marrow Involvement  
Bone marrow obtained within 28 days  prior to study enrollment with tumor cells 
seen on routine morphology (not by [CONTACT_442837]) of 
bilateral aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99203]. 
 
Bone Marrow responses are determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone marrow biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] [ADDRESS_771581] 21 days  apart. Normalization of urinary 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at 

                        ADVL1 414

study enrollment. 
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_6786] a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND 
a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by [CONTACT_5293]. (For example, a patient entering with 5 % 
tumor in marrow by [CONTACT_6787] ≥ 25% tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 
30% tumor must increase to > 60%). 
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma in bone marrow will be defined as progressive dis ease if 
tumor is detected in [ADDRESS_771582] 21 days apart.  
 
Stable Disease: Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive 
disease.  
 
12.5.[ADDRESS_771583] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the overall response assessments as described in Section 12.7.[ADDRESS_771584] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If 
multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of  the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the 
thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect (e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice). 
 
Any change in size of non- target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.

Version Date: 11/10/[ADDRESS_771585] perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesi ons – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements.  
 
• Minor Response (MR): A greater than or equal to 25% but less than 50% 
reduction in the product of the greatest tumor diame ter and its perpendicular 
diameter on MRI scan, on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids with a stable 
or improving neurologic examination.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the  sum of the products 
of the  perpendicular diameters of the target lesion s, taking as reference the 
smallest sum of the products observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
12.6.5  Response Criteria for Non- Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non- target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
 
12.6.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally high levels.  
 
12.6.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table b elow. The 
overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

12.7.2  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR , PR, or MR  (whichever is first 
recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (tak ing as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objec tively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the data collection packet 
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting. 
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade  (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6716].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label. 
 
Com mercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source.  The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0. All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov /protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ).

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  64 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3:  Review Table A in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol- specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol- specific exceptions to the reporting requirements.   
Note :  This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_771587] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the 
agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions  in th e table 
below. Attribution categories are as follows:  Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Definite.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of t he outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported via CTEP -AERS within 
the timeframes detailed in the table below.

prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) must be reported regardless of attribution and designation 
as expected or unexpected with the exception of any events identified as proto col-specific 
expedited adverse event  reporting exclusions. 
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or 
birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs following treatment with an 
agent under a CTEP IND. 
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial registration 
on all reports. 
 
Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP -AERS  Expedited Reporting Requirements for Phase 1

As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS  reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) via the web 
at http://ctep.cancer.gov (email the ADVL1414 COG Study Assigned Research 
Coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS  24-Hour 
Notification web -based application is unavailable) and by [CONTACT_586377] . Once internet connectivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_771592] be 
entered el ectronically into CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_433].  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event  (refer to Table A ). 
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP- AERS  (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page https://eapps-

13.3.1  CTEP -AERS  Reporting 
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the NCI’s Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System ( CTEP -AERS ) that can be found at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov.  
An CTEP -AERS  report must be submitted electronically  via the CTEP -AERS  
                        ADVL1 414

Web -based application located at https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers.  If 
prompted to enter a sponsor email address, please type in: 
[EMAIL_1961]. 
 
Email supporting documentation to the ADVL1414 COG Study Assigned 
Research Coordinator.  ALWAYS include the ticket number on all emailed  
documents . 
 
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG data 
submission forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the most severe grade of the event should be reported . 
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_771593] (most severe) 
grade of the Adverse Effects.  
 
13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline or less than Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the resolution 
date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE 
decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
resolution date should be recorded as "ong oing."   
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_771594] be reported 
each c ourse it recurs.  
 
13.5 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_6681]  
 
13.5.1  Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP -AERS  reporting ( Section 13.2
) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the data form p acket (See 
Section 14.1 ). 
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_771595] reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair , to 
the FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for industry sponsored trials).  
13.5.[ADDRESS_771596] responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS  
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients following their chemotherapy for cancer must be reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program 
                        ADVL1 414 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  68 
 
(CTEP) via CTEP -AERS  and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm  reporting 
requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the completed CTEP -
AERS  report within 14 days  of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after treatment for 
cancer on trials . 
 
 Secondary Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
All secondary malignancies that occur  following protocol treatment be reported via CTEP -
AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  (e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])   
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)   
3) Treatment -related sec ondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
Second Malignancy :  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal 
When submitting CTEP -AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and emailed  along with any 
additional medical information to the ADVL1414 COG Study Assigned Research 
Coordinator. The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent should 
be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS  report , along with 
the source of exposure (mother, father, breastfeeding).  
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_771597] dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited m anner via CTEP -AERS  as 
Grade 3  “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(Pregnancy) ” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” SOC . 
 
• Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known. If the baby [CONTACT_6796] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is 
required.  
 
 
13.7.2  Pregnancy Loss ( Fetal Death ) 
• Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.”  
•  Any pregnancy loss  should be reported expeditiously d as Grade 4  
                        ADVL1 414 
 
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Version Date: 11/10/2020  69 
 
“Pregnancy  loss”  under the  “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions” SOC . Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event  
since  CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5  event as a patient death.  
  
13.7.3  Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn deaths  occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth ” that is felt by  [CONTACT_586378]/intervention, should be reported 
expeditiously.  
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “Death 
neonatal ” under the General disorders and administration SOC  when the 
death is the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of 
men on study.   
• Do NOT report  a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men as a Grade 5 event as CTEP -AERS  
recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient  death .  
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is known at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. The “Pregnancy Information Form” should be used 
for all necessary follow-ups. This form is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyReportForm.pdf.  
 
13.7.[ADDRESS_771598] labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, including the following: prescribing, 
order communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, 
administration, education, monitoring, and use. All occurrences of abuse, misuse, 
or medication error with any study treatment are to be  recorded on an SAE report 
form and sent to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance, regardless of  whether o r not an 
AE or SAE has occurred due to the abuse, misuse, or medication error. If the abuse, misuse, or medication error is associated with an SAE, the SAE report 
form must be submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_771599] be submitted within 24 
hours of awareness.

Sample Processing Procedures : 
1. Ensure all tubes are labeled appropriately with site number, patient number and initials, and collection date prior 
to collection. Use a fine -point black permanent marker or lab marker to label tubes.  
2. Collect [ADDRESS_771609] EDTA tube on ice o r at 4°C for no longer than 30 minutes.  
5. Centrifuge tube within 30 minutes of collection at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C until red cells and plasma are separated by a well –formed polymer barrier.  
6. Transfer the plasma sample equally, using a transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462],  into two cryogenic vials (Aliquot A and B). Do not 
transfer the Buffy coat or any of the red cell pellet into the plasma sample as this will render the sample unusable for analysis.  
7. Immediately after transfer, the aliquots are stored at -70°C to -80°C.  
 
Sample Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_335]:   
Batch and ship all Aliquots A for each patient together in the same shipment on dry ice to Karyopharm Therapeutics. Note: If samples for more than [ADDRESS_771610] be grouped (e.g., separate boxes or paper sleeves for each patient). Retain Aliquot B samples until requested by [CONTACT_586380].

Sample Processing Procedures : 
1. Ensure PAXgene® Blood RNA Tube is at 18°C to 25°C prior to sample collection.  To prevent contamination, 
the PAXgene® tube should be the last tube drawn  for the correlative studies.  
2. Allow at least [ADDRESS_771612]. Ensure that the blood has stopped flowing into 
the tube before removing the tube from the holder. The PAXgene® tube with its vacuum is designed to dr aw up 
to 2.[ADDRESS_771613] 2 .5 ml of blood into each of the two PAXgene® tubes required at every time point. Label tubes as Aliquot 
(A) and Aliquot (B).  
4. Immediately after blood collection, gently invert the PAXgene® tube 8 – 10 times.   
5. Store the PAXgene® tube upright at room temperature (18°C to 25°C) for a minimum of 2 hours and a maximum 
of 72 hours before transferring to a -20°C freezer.  
6. When freezing samples, stand the PAXgene® tube upright in a wire rack. Do not freeze tubes uprig ht in a 
styrofoam tray as this may cause the tubes to crack.  
7. The PAXgene® tubes can be stored at -20°C and below. If tubes are to be kept at temperatures below -20°C, 
freeze them first at -20°C for 24 hours, then transfer them to -70°C or -80°C.

                           Paraffin Embedded Tissue Block                 Unstained Slides
 
 
All blocks or slides must be labeled with the patient’s study registration number (COG Patient ID #), the study I.D. 
(ADVL1414), and the sample collection date. Data should be recorded on this Tissue Studies Form, which must 
accompany the sample(s).   
Arch ived Tissue Samples: Archived paraffin -embedded tissue must be available for any previous resections for that 
patient (approximately 20 unstained slides or tumor block). The blocks or slides of tumor material should be sent at 
room temperature  via Federal Express. During the warmer months (June – August), it is advisable to ship the block(s) 
with a frozen gel ice -pack in order to prevent the melting of paraffin -embedded tissue blocks during transit. Ensure 
cold pack is not in direct contact [CONTACT_531926].   
Tumor B iopsy  Collected at Surgical Resection  
Tumor tissue will be obtained upon surgical resection during cycle [ADDRESS_771615] surgical procedures. Approximately 0.5 ml will be f resh frozen with 
preservatives in 2 mL screw cap cryogenic vials, while the remainder will be preserved in 10% buffered formalin in 
15 ml conical tubes.   
a. Fresh (flash frozen) biopsy  (approximately 0.5 ml collected). Please collect in the 2 mL screw cap cry ogenic vials. 
Please do not fill tube more than ~1/3 full (~0.6 ml). Biopsy samples should be  stored  frozen  at or below -70°C  until 
shipment. Frozen samples will be shipped on dry ice.   
b. Formalin-f ixed biopsy  (remainder of sample collected during surgery after collection of fresh non -preserved 
tissue). Biopsy samples that are fixed in 10% buffered formalin will be stored at 4°C at the study sites until shipment. Parafilm all tubes. Fixed samples will be  batched and shipped at 4°C.

APPENDIX X:  PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR TREATING DIARRHEA  
 
Guidelines for the Treatment of Diarrhea  
 
Institutional practice may be used in place of these guidelines.  
 
You should purchase or will be given a prescription for loperamide to have available to begin treatment at 
the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_527300]. Patients will also be instructed to contact [CONTACT_527331]. Patients will be given loperamide  based on body weight.  
 
Be aware of your child's bowel movements. At the first sign they become softer than usual or if your child 
has any  notable increase in the number of bowel movements over what is normal for him/her, begin taking 
loperamide (Imodium).   
Please follow these directions carefully, using dosing guidelines b elow: 
• Take _____________  at the first sign of diarrhea. 
• Continue taking __________  every __ hours until the diarrhea slows or the normal pattern of 
bowel movements returns. Repeat the same doses and frequency if the diarrhea returns. 
• Do not exceed ___________ in a 24 hour period. 
• Please call your doctor if you have any questions about taking loperamide, if your child's diarrhea 
is not under control after two days, or if he/she is feeling extremely weak, lig htheaded, or dizzy. 
• Make an extra effort to give your child lots of fluids (several glasses of pedialyte, fruit juices, 
soda, soup, etc.) while your child is participating in this study. 
• Side effects may include tiredness, drowsiness or dizziness. If your child experiences these side 
effects, or if your child is urinating less frequently than usual, please contact [CONTACT_51443]'s 
physician. 
• Do not give your child any laxatives without consulting with his/her physician.

APPENDIX XII: YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
 
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY 
(for children from  7 through 12 years of age) 
 
A study of s elinexor in patients with r ecurrent and refractory solid tumors, i ncluding CNS tumors  
 
1. We have been talking with you about taking part in a research study because you have  cancer.  A 
research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In 
this study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the kind of cancer you have. We will do 
this by [CONTACT_107467] a new medicine to treat your cancer.  
 
2. Children who are part of this study will be treated with a cancer fighting medicine called selinexor. You will have regular tests and exams done more often while you are in this study. The 
doctors want to see if selinexor will work well to get rid of your cancer. That is why we are doing 
this study.  
 
3. Sometimes good things can happen to people whe n they are in a research study.  These goo d 
things are called “benefits.”  We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is selinexor 
may cause your cancer to shrink or go away but we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of the study. 
 
4. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that you may have problems or side effects 
from selinexor. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
5. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this stu dy at any time once you s tart. There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have. 
 
6. If you decide to be treated with selinexor you will have some tests and check -ups done more 
often than you might if you weren’t part of the study. Some of these needed tests will require 
extra needle sticks to collect  additional blood samples . 
 
7. We are asking your permission to collect additional blood. We want to see if there are ways to tell 
how the cancer will respond to treatment. Some of these samples are collected when you may not 
need to have a blood sample taken and may require extra needle sticks. You can still take part in 
this study even if you don't allow us to collect the extra blood samples for res earch .

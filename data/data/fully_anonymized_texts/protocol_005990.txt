PROGRAM FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND OUD: A PI[INVESTIGATOR_313431] 
(VR-OUD PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571])
Protocol V 1.6
BACKGROUND
A. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) is highly associated with comorbid chronic pain. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], 
a condition affecting [ADDRESS_385886] severe chronic pain.3–[ADDRESS_385887] OUD outcomes, likely mediated 
through increased opi[INVESTIGATOR_313432]/or reduce depression and anxiety symptoms.5–8
B. New and innovative treatments for chronic pain are needed. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_313433], 
established treatments are ineffective, laden with severe side effects, or inaccessible. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_313434], moreover, carries significant risk of severe 
adverse events including overdose.9,10 For these reasons, non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic pain is 
recommended by [CONTACT_313454]. However, numerous barriers, including local 
availability and perceived lack of efficacy, impede access to non-pharmacologic treatment options.11 For 
these reasons, studies of new and innovative treatments are needed.
C. Barriers and facilitators to non-pharmacologic treatment for chronic pain among persons with 
OUD. Accessing non-pharmacologic treatment among persons with OUD is further compounded by 
[CONTACT_313455], including stigma and federal requirements requiring persons to visit MMTPs daily 
or very regularly.12–[ADDRESS_385888] established that VR interventions 
for the treatment of chronic pain are promising, but interventions to date are heterogenous and further 
study is needed to demonstrate efficacy.21–23 For example, immersive VR in a virtual environment tends 
to be associated with higher pain reduction and greater satisfaction.24–26 Relevant to this application, the 
immersive VR intervention (RelieVRx) proposed for use in the current study was tested in a sample of 
179 adults with chronic low back pain and shown to be effective in an 8-week trial in reducing pain and 
improving sleep, mood, and stress; most changes persisted up to [ADDRESS_385889] been used in substance use disorders, and early evidence suggests VR 
treatments can be effective in OUD. A recent systematic review concluded that VR treatments can 
provide benefits in substance use disorder treatment, mainly owing to the ability of a therapeutic, 
immersive environment.29 In persons with nicotine addiction and alcohol use disorder, VR treatments 
found mixed to positive results on a number of nicotine and alcohol outcomes, including decreased 
craving.30–[ADDRESS_385890] been associated with a myriad of 
positive outcomes that are relevant to the current study, including improved quality of life, pain 
interference, mood and anxiety symptoms, sleep quality, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].41–49 We propose

biomarkers linked to stress (such as cortisol) and inflammation (such as C-reactive protein and cytokine 
levels).45,50–52 Reductions in both stress and inflammation, in turn, are associated with improved pain and 
OUD outcomes.53–[ADDRESS_385892] study of VR treatment in a methadone maintenance treatment program (MMTP), 
and has the potential for widespread application.
STUDY DESIGN
Overview. In a 6-week pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], we will assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an immersive 
mindfulness VR treatment (RelieVRx) versus a non-immersive sham VR control (sham VR) for the 
treatment of pain and OUD. We will recruit 40 adults with OUD and chronic pain enrolled in an MMTP 
and randomize 1:[ADDRESS_385893] pain and psychological assessments at baseline, 3 weeks, and at the study conclusion at 6 
weeks. We will also explore changes in stress and inflammatory saliva and blood biomarkers at baseline, 
3 weeks and 6 weeks. To assess feasibility, we will examine recruitment and retention and assess patient 
satisfaction. Our preliminary efficacy co-primary outcomes are (1) change in pain intensity and (2) 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_313435] [ADDRESS_385894] study visits at one Montefiore Opi[INVESTIGATOR_313436] (OTP). Montefiore has the largest network of OTPs in [LOCATION_001] State. Three of the five 
Montefiore OTPs comprise the Montefiore Division of Substance Abuse (DoSA) Wellness Centers; in 
total, these sites serve approximately 3,000 individuals. Electronic health data indicates that of 945 people 
with a chronic pain diagnosis who are on methadone for OUD, 555 (59%) are Male, mean age is 58.3, 
566 (60%) are Hispanic, 170 (18%) are Black, and 140 (15%) are White. 
Participants: We will enroll 40 participants. As the narration of the VR device is only provided in 
English at this time, we require English proficiency for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Inclusion criteria: 1) ≥18 years 
old, 2) English proficiency; 3) receiving methadone treatment for DSM-[ADDRESS_385895] 12 weeks, with no dose change in 14 days to ensure treatment stability; 4) 
chronic pain of at least moderate pain severity (score  ≥4 on the Pain, Enjoyment of Life, and General 
Activity (PEG) scale);57 5) willingness to participate in all study components; and 6) ability to provide 
informed consent, assessed using consent teach-back. Exclusion criteria: 1) conditions that could make 
participation in VR hazardous or cause adverse effects (current or prior diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], seizure 
disorder, dementia, or migraines, any medical condition predisposing to nausea or dizziness, 
hypersensitivity to flashing light or motion), 2) conditions that could prevent proper use of the VR 
headset (stereoscopic vision or severe hearing impairment, or injury to eyes, face, or neck that prevents 
use of the VR headset), and 3) acute exacerbation of psychiatric conditions that preclude the ability to 
participate in the study. Pregnant patients are NOT excluded from the trial as there are no 
contraindications to their use of a VR device, but we are not specifically targeting pregnant patients for 
this study nor are we testing for pregnancy.
Recruitment, Screening, and Randomization. Recruitment will be active and passive in the OTP. 
Based on our team’s prior DoSA trials and the scope of this current project, we anticipate enrolling 1-2

participants weekly. Research staff will enroll from one DoSA site for the duration of the trial; we will 
plan our recruitment strategy in conjunction with other IMPOWR-ME trials as to not recruit from the 
same pool of patients at a site at the same time. We expect retention of approximately 85% based on our 
groups prior DoSA trials.58,59 Screening: After obtaining written consent, we will administer a screening 
questionnaire. Potentially eligible subjects will then complete a written informed consent process 
including discussion of procedures and risks and benefits before being randomized. Consent will occur in 
a private area of the OTP. Randomization: Randomization will occur using block randomization (blocks 
of 4) to two 
conditions in a 1:1 
ratio. 
Description of 
intervention and 
control. Both 
intervention and 
control arms will 
utilize a Pi[CONTACT_3252] G2 
head-mounted VR 
device with pre-
installed software. 
RelieVRx 
incorporates 
evidence-based 
principles of 
cognitive behavioral 
therapy and 
mindfulness to 
provide pain 
neuroscience 
education and to 
train users on 
evidence-based pain 
and stress 
management 
strategies with 
interactive and 
immersive exercises 
and experiences. In 
total, RelieVRx 
combines 
biopsychosocial 
pain education, 
diaphragmatic 
breathing training, 
relaxation exercises, 
and executive functioning and attentional games to strengthen pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. RelieVRx is typi[INVESTIGATOR_313437] a 56-day program through daily virtual experiences, with each experience lasting between 2 
and 16 minutes; in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will conduct in-office virtual experiences twice weekly. Each 
session will last about 20-30 minutes and go through 1-5 virtual experiences. The sham VR control is a 
non-immersive set of 56 daily virtual experiences, tuned to the length of the RelieVRx. Control 
participants will similarly experience 1-5 virtual experiences in each 20-30 session.Table 1. Overview of Data Collection

information from the Montefiore EMR, SMART EMR (methadone dosage), and from the [LOCATION_001] 
State Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP). Study measures are listed in Table 1; where possible we 
align our measures with IMPOWR CDEs and with IMMPACT recommendations for study of chronic 
pain.[ADDRESS_385898] before and after surveys to ask about 
experiences during VR exercises not taking more than 5 minutes; these will be paper based, scanned, and 
uploaded to Montefiore BOX, a HIPAA-compliant online cloud storage service. A portion of blood will 
also be bio-banked to facilitate future biomarker analyses. We will conduct an optional qualitative 
interview exploring experiences in the trial at the conclusion of the trial; participant interviews will be 
recorded and transcribed for analysis.
Informed Consent. The RA will screen all potential participants for inclusion and exclusion criteria in a 
private area of the MMTP. First, we will obtain written consent to administer a screening questionnaire. 
Screening questionnaire questions will focus on inclusion and exclusion criteria, pain history, and also 
ask about prior use of virtual reality devices. The initial screening questionnaire will take [ADDRESS_385899] study visit at a convenient time. Participants will be reimbursed $50 for their 
participation at each study assessment. If they choose to participate in the optional qualitative component, 
they will be reimbursed an additional $30.
Tests and procedures, including blood draws and saliva samples, performed at study assessments will not 
be billed to participants.
Patient privacy protection. We will strip patients’ protected health information from all data before 
conducting analyses. As in prior studies we have conducted, we will have a “name-based” and an “ID-
based” identification system that will remain separate. In the name-based system, all documents that
have patient identifiers will be filed together. Some of these documents will have participants’
signatures (e.g., consent forms). In the ID-based system, all documents that do not include
identifying information or signatures will use participants’ unique study IDs (rather than names)
and will be filed together. All forms will contain either a “name-based” or an “ID-based” identifier,
but never both. There will be only one electronic document that links participants’ names to their
study IDs; only the study staff will have access to this document, which will be password protected and 
kept on password-protected servers.
Study data will be kept in a password-protected, encrypted file on password-protected servers that are 
backed up daily. No one but the study team will have access to study data.  Publication or presentation of 
study results will not include information that would allow for identification of providers or patients.

Analytic plan. Feasibility: Feasibility outcomes will be measured as proportions. Preliminary Efficacy: 
To examine the association between treatment arm and the co-primary outcomes, we will use separate 2-
level mixed-effects linear regression model with the treatment arm as a mixed effect with participant-
specific random intercepts to account for hierarchical data. The difference in trends of pain intensity and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_313440]-by-arm interaction. For secondary outcomes and stress and 
inflammation exploratory outcomes, we will use a similar strategy; where outcomes are dichotomous, we 
will use 2-level mixed effects logistic regression models.
We will use thematic analysis to analyze transcripts in the qualitative study.
Power analysis. The primary purpose of this study is to test feasibility and to generate preliminary data 
for a future R01 application. We are able to enroll [ADDRESS_385900] size of d=0.49, and [ADDRESS_385901] 70% power to detect a 
difference of this magnitude or larger. We expect to have greater statistical power using mixed effects 
linear regression models with repeated measures over time.
Risks/Benefits. We expect the major risks to be associated with the VR technology. VR can sometimes
cause “cybersickness” in some patients, especially when playing or experiencing fast moving games or 
videos. RelieVRx is a much less intense program designed to minimize these sensations. In the clinical 
trial of RelieVRx, about 10% of participants reported some nausea and/or motion sickness, but these 
symptoms were temporary and none decided to terminate their use of the technology because of adverse 
events. In our preliminary data of [ADDRESS_385902] therapy: a nested prospective cohort study in Norway. Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy.

2.0  BACKGROUND
2.1  Locally-advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (LA-NSCLC)
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in 
the [LOCATION_002] and worldwide, causing nearly one million deaths each year.[ADDRESS_1258590] of NSCLC patients are diagnosed with locally-advanced disease, which may be defined as unresectable stage II disease or stage III disease.
2  
For locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), the standard treatment 
approach is conventionally-fractionated (1.8-2.0 Gy/day) radiotherapy (RT) to a dose of 
approximately 60-66 Gy with concurrent, platinum-based chemotherapy.  This treatment 
approach, however, yields median survival times of only 16-23 months and local control 
rates of only 40-66%.3-[ADDRESS_1258591] yielded disappointing results in phase III trials.  Administration of induction chemotherapy prior to chemoradiotherapy (ChemoRT) did not decrease the rate of distant relapse or improve overall survival (OS).
8  Similarly, addition of consolidation

Version 6;  Date 5/6/15docetaxel to  conventional ChemoRT increased toxicity but did not improve survival.[ADDRESS_1258592] sequential chemoRT.11  
Concurrent chemoRT was found to significantly improve OS and locoregional disease 
control (LRC), but it did not decrease the rate of distant progression.  This is direct 
evidence that intensification of locoregional therapy can improve overall survival in LA-
NSCLC.
Since concurrent  chemoRT has been adopted as the standard of care for LA-
NSCLC, several approaches to further improving locoregional therapy have been 
explored.  Trimodality therapy, consisting of neoadjuvant ChemoRT followed by [CONTACT_676160], improved progression-free survival but not OS in a phase III study.12  The value 
of RT dose escalation in the setting of definitive chemoRT was evaluated in RTOG 0617, 
a large, randomized trial in which patients were randomized to conventional dose (60 Gy 
in 30 fractions) versus high dose (74 Gy in 37 fractions) RT with concurrent weekly 
carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Based on a second randomization, ½ of enrolled patients also 
received daily cetuximab.  The [ADDRESS_1258593] fractionation.
2.2  PET Imaging  for LA-NSCLC
FDG-PET/CT imaging  is recommended as part of the staging workup for most 
patients with suspected or newly-diagnosed NSCLC.  Depending on the presumed 
stage based on clinical findings and anatomic imaging, PET leads to upstaging in 12-
21% of patients.14-16  Implementation of PET imaging may alter the management of 
NSCLC patients in up to 40% of cases.15,17,18  Several reports indicate that for NSCLC 
patients, PET metrics such as maximum SUV (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume 
(MTV), and total glycolytic activity (TGA) may be independent predictors of overall 
survival.19-22.
The clinical  significance of quantitative PET findings before and after 
conventionally-fractionated chemoradiotherapy for LA-NSCLC was the subject of the 
multi-institutional ACRIN 6668 / RTOG [ADDRESS_1258594] 60 Gy and the use of one platinum-based

Version 6;  Date 5/6/15chemotherapeutic agent  with a second non-platinum agent.  In the primary analysis of 
that study, pre-treatment SUVmax and peak SUV (SUVpeak) values were not found to 
be prognostic with respect to LRC or OS.  Post-treatment SUVmax and SUVpeak, on 
the other hand, correlated with both LRC and OS.[ADDRESS_1258595]-treatment imaging effectively stratified patients into 
favorable and  unfavorable groups. (Personal communication with ACRIN/RTOG 
investigators, Figure  1)
Figure 1  – Unpublished results from ACRIN 6668 / RTOG 0235.  Kaplan-Meier curves were generated 
using data from [ADDRESS_1258596]-treatment SUVpeak 
predicts for OS.  An SUVpeak value of 5.0 corresponds to an SUVmax value of approximately 6.0.
Our group  has been working with the ACRIN 6668 / RTOG [ADDRESS_1258597] found that pre-treatment MTV, defined as the composite volume of all 
hypermetabolic lesions  delineated on PET imaging, is an independent predictor of both 
LRC and  OS. (Figures 2a and 2b)  We have also found that for individual tumors and 
hypermetabolic lymph nodes,  pre-treatment MTV correlates with the risk of persistent 
hypermetabolic activity on  post-treatment imaging. (Figure 3)  Based on these results, 
we hypothesize  that pre-treatment MTV identifies high-risk lesions for which RT 
intensification is likely to provide clinical benefit.

2.3  Intensity-Modulated  Radiotherapy (IMRT) for LA-NSCLC
In intensity-modulated  radiotherapy (IMRT), multiple beam angles and dozens of 
beam segments are used to deliver highly conformal RT.  Computerized inverse 
planning is used to identify the combination of beam segments that optimally covers the 
target volumes with the prescribed RT dose while limiting the dose to surrounding 
normal structures based on pre-specified constraints.24   IMRT is commonly used for a 
number of malignancies, including LA-NSCLC.  In a large single-institution experience, 
the adoption of IMRT for LA-NSCLC was associated with significant improvements in 
OS.25  In the aforementioned RTOG 0617 trial, approximately 50% of patients were 
treated with IMRT.13
An additional  benefit of IMRT compared to older treatment techniques is that 
IMRT can be used to perform “dose painting”, also referred to as the “simultaneous 
integrated boost  technique”.  This means that in a single session, various target 
volumes can  be treated with different RT doses, which are generally based on historical 
failure patterns.  This approach is commonly used for head and neck cancer26 and anal 
cancer27, where dose levels are based on lesion type (primary tumor v. lymph node) 
and size.  This approach has not yet been adopted for the treatment of NSCLC, 
presumably because locoregional failure patterns have been difficult to establish using 
anatomic imaging, and distant failure remains common.
2.4  Safety  of RT Intensification
IRB NUMBER: 2013-252
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 02/16/2017
17
Version 6;  Date 5/6/15We hypothesize  that pre-treatment PET imaging can be used to identify high-risk 
lesions for which RT dose escalation is likely to provide clinical benefit.  In this trial, we 
will utilize IMRT to selectively treat high-risk lesions with intensified RT dosing.  The 
safety of chemoRT dose escalation to larger volumes has already been established, as 
has the safety of modest chemoRT hypofractionation (use of daily fraction sizes > 2.0 
Gy).  Therefore we are confident that our regimen will be well-tolerated.
In RTOG  0617, patients on the experimental arm were treated with high-dose 
concurrent chemoRT.  They received an RT dose of 74 Gy in 37 fractions over 7 ½ 
weeks, along with weekly carboplatin (AUC=2) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m2).13  This RT 
schedule was based on previous phase I and II studies demonstrating the safety of 
chemoRT dose escalation up to 74 Gy.28-30  Preliminary results from RTOG 0617 
indicate that high-dose chemoRT was well-tolerated, and treatment-related toxicities did 
not account for the study’s negative results.
Several single-institution  reports indicate that gentle chemoRT hypofractionation 
is well-tolerated.  In a Japanese study, 10 patients with stage III NSCLC were treated 
with daily RT fraction sizes of 2.5 Gy to a median dose of 65 Gy.31  All patients received 
concurrent chemotherapy consisting of weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Treatment 
was extremely well-tolerated, with no reported acute or late grade ≥ 3 toxicities.  In a 
second trial, 14 patients were treated with 52.5 Gy in 15 fractions (3.5 Gy/fraction) with 
concurrent liposomal doxorubicin and vinorelbine.32  No grade ≥  [ADDRESS_1258599] been treated with hypofractionated RT along with carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Daily 
fraction sizes were based on predicted complication probabilities, and patients were 
treated to biologically equivalent doses of 80-100 Gy over 30 fractions.  Based on 
encouraging toxicity and efficacy results from the Michigan group, the RTOG has 
opened a phase II study using a similar design. (RTOG 1106 protocol)
Table 1  describes our proposed RT dosing schema along with RT schedules 
used in other studies.  Time-adjusted biologically equivalent doses are also provided, 
using the Linear Quadratic Model and published estimates for model parameters.33,34  
Based on the data summarized above, “high-risk” lesions shall be defined as tumors or 
lymph nodes with MTV greater than 25 cc on pre-treatment PET imaging.

2.5  Biomarker Studies
Metabolomics is the "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that 
specific cellular processes leave behind".[ADDRESS_1258600] 
commonly used to quantify metabolite levels are nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy (MS).  Metabolomics is an emerging discipline that may one day change medical practice in fields such as nutrition, toxicology, endocrinology, and oncology.

Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine and Director of the Stable Isotope and Metabolomics Core Facility of the Diabetes Research Center.  Blood and urine samples collected as part of this protocol we be used to study of the metabolomics of lung cancer and how they evolve during chemoradiotherapy.  These exploratory analyses will identify promising subjects for future prospective study.
2.6  Rationale for Treating Low-risk Lesions with a Conservative RT Dose
This protocol is being amended such that tumors or lymph nodes deemed to be 
low-risk (based on having pre-treatment MTV < 25 cc) will be treated with a total RT dose of 52.5 Gy (2.1 Gy per fraction).  This is a modest decrease compared to the initial study design, where such lesions were treated with 57 Gy (2.28 Gy per fraction).  This change is supported by a number of studies whose results have become available since the initial design of this trial as well as older studies that can now be viewed in a different context:

Version 6; Date 5/6/15escalation unexpectedly led to a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall survival.  Median survival was 29 months in the control arm and only 20 months in the high-dose arm.  Rates of Grade 5 treatment-related toxicity were 2% and 4% in the control and experimental arms, respectively.  Although this difference does little to explain the large difference in outcomes between the two arms, multivariable analysis revealed that the occurrence of severe acute radiation esophagitis and the RT dose received by [CONTACT_897956].
46  This suggests that the additional RT 
delivered to thoracic organs in the high-dose arm may directly lead to decreased patient survival.  Decreasing the dose delivered to these organs, conversely, may be expected to improve outcomes.
A large National Cancer Database analysis of over 30,000 locally-advanced 
NSCLC patients who underwent potentially-curative resection demonstrated that the use of postoperative RT with a dose above 54 Gy was associated with significantly lower 5-year survival than the use of a dose between 45 and 54 Gy (28% v. 38%).
47  The use of high RT doses remained statistically significantly 
associated with inferior overall survival on multivariable analysis.
A retrospective review performed at our institution has demonstrated that, 
although locoregional progression is common following definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally-advanced NSCLC, the specific site of tumor progression can be predicted based on pre-treatment PET.
48  We found that the 
2-year cumulative incidence rate for progression in lesions larger than 25 cc was 45%, compared to only 5% for lesions under 25 cc (p < 0.001).  Many of the lesions smaller than 25 cc were treated with doses below 55 Gy, and only one such lesion progressed following treatment (Figures 4 and 5).

RTOG 73-01 was a randomized trial testing four RT schedules for locally-
advanced NSCLC.49  Its results are often cited as the rationale for the “standard” 
dose of 60 Gy.  Review of the results from that study, however, demonstrates that there was no difference in overall survival between patients who were treated with 50 Gy and those who received 60 Gy (Figure 6).  In light of this, reducing the RT dose for lesions deemed to be at low risk for disease progression to 52.[ADDRESS_1258604] from patients’ outcomes.

The data summarized  above support reduction of the RT dose administered to 
low-risk tumors and lymph nodes.  While de-escalation of therapy for a patient 
population where cure rates are limited seems counterintuitive, it is important to note 
that we are only scaling back therapy for lesions whose local control has been excellent 
(Figure 5).  The new dose of 52.5 Gy for these lesions was chosen because it exceeds 
the 50 Gy dose studied in RTOG 73-01 but remains within the acceptable range of 
doses suggested by [CONTACT_897957].47  If patients enrolled on this 
study develop disease progression in low-risk lesions treated with 52.5 Gy, we will 
revise this amendment.

4.0  STUDY DESIGN
4.1  General  Design
Treatment
This will  be a single stage phase II study testing the efficacy and feasibility of 
hypofractionated, dose-painted IMRT (based on target lesion volumes on pre-treatment 
PET/CT imaging) with standard concurrent chemotherapy (low dose weekly carboplatin 
and paclitaxel) for the treatment of LA-NSCLC.  Any lesions with pre-treatment MTV 
greater than 25 cc will be prescribed the higher dose (2.6 Gy per fraction), and lesions 
with MTV less than 25 cc will be treated with the lower dose (2.28 Gy per fraction).  All 
patients will be treated with [ADDRESS_1258611] weekly dosing of carboplatin (AUC 2) and 
paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) chemotherapy weekly for five weeks during RT.  This may be 
followed by 3 cycles of full dose adjuvant carboplatin (AUC 6) and/ paclitaxel 
(200mg/m2) every [ADDRESS_1258612] restaging PET/CT scan after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy or 12-[ADDRESS_1258613]-
treatment PET/CT imaging 12-[ADDRESS_1258614] or PET/CT is recommended every three

5.0  STUDY THERAPY
5.1  Radiotherapy
5.1.1  Immobilization, Simulation, and Localization
Patients will be positioned in a stable position capable of allowing accurate 
reproducibility of the target position from treatment to treatment. Positions uncomfortable for the patient should be avoided so as to prevent uncontrolled movement during treatments. A variety of immobilization systems may be used, including stereotactic frames that surround the patient on three sides and large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients’ external contours) with reference to the stereotactic coordinate system.  Patient immobilization must be reliable enough to ensure that the gross tumor volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the confines of the planning treatment volume (PTV) with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).
Special considerations must be made to account for the effect of internal organ 
motion (e.g., breathing) on target positioning and reproducibility. Acceptable maneuvers include reliable abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating with the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], active breath-holding techniques, and use of 4D simulation CT to generate internal target volumes (ITVs).  Internal organ inhibition maneuvers must be reliable enough to insure that the GTV does not deviate beyond the confines of the PTV with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).
Computed tomography will be the primary image platform for targeting and 
treatment planning.  The planning CT scans should be performed with IV contrast unless the patient has allergic problems with contrast or has renal insufficiency.  Contrast will allow better distinction between target lesions and adjacent vessels or atelectasis.  Axial acquisitions with gantry 0 degrees will be required with spacing ≤ 3.0

Version 6;  Date 5/6/15mm between  scans in the region of the tumor.  Images will be transferred to the 
treatment planning computers for treatment planning.
Isocenter or  reference point port localization images (anterior/posterior and 
lateral) should be obtained at each treatment on the treatment unit (or patients should 
undergo a tomographic imaging study using the linear accelerator couch, if available) 
immediately before treatment to ensure proper alignment of the geometric center (i.e., 
isocenter) of the simulated fields.  Verification CT scans and portal films following each 
treatment may be taken at the discretion of the treating physician but are not required.
5.1.[ADDRESS_1258620] scans to aid 
with localization of hypermetabolic lesions.  The low-risk gross tumor volume 
(GTV_5250 ) shall include the pulmonary tumor(s) as well as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_897949] (based on appearance, size ≥ 1cm in short axis, or pathologic data).  A high-risk 
gross tumor volume (GTV_6500), will also be defined and will include only lesions with 
MTV > 25 cc on pre-treatment PET imaging.  MTV calculations will be performed on 
PET imaging using a semiautomatic gradient-based contouring algorithm (“PET Edge”, 
MIMvista Corp, Cleveland, OH) or using a thresholding tool to encompass all voxels 
with SUV > 40% of the SUVmax.[ADDRESS_1258621] phase that 
will be used for treatment (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 4/10 phases if respi[INVESTIGATOR_897950], or 
10/10 phases if the patient will be treated while breathing freely).  GTVs will be 
combined to form internal target volumes (ITVs).
Each GTV  (or ITV) will be expanded by 7-10 mm to form a CTV (CTV_5250 and 
CTV_6500).  CTVs may be trimmed to exclude anatomic boundaries to microscopic 
tumor spread.  CTV_6500 will be a subset of CTV_5250.
Each CTV  will be expanded to form a PTV.  PTV expansions will be 5 mm in all 
directions if respi[INVESTIGATOR_787582] (eg: with beam gating, breath 
hold, or use of 4D-CT to form internal target volumes).  Otherwise, PTV expansions will 
be 5 mm radially and 10 mm in the superior and inferior directions.  PTV_6500 will be a 
subset of PTV_5250.
For high-risk  lesions that are in close proximity to a dose-limiting structure (eg: 
large supraclavicular lymph node abutting brachial plexus), the prescription dose will be 
2.4 Gy x 25 fractions = 60 Gy.  A GTV_6000, CTV_6000, and PTV_6000 shall be 
generated for those lesions as described above.
Adaptive RT  (adjustment of target volumes during the course of RT) is not 
allowed in this protocol, unless difficulties with daily patient setup require repeating the 
CT simulation procedure.

Version 6;  Date 5/6/15Megavoltage equipment  is required with effective photon energies of 6-18 MV. 
Use of IMRT or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is required for this protocol.  
All fields must be individually shaped to minimize structures and lung not within the 
target volume. Divergent custom-made blocks or multi-leaf collimation will be used. All 
treatment planning will be performed using tissue heterogeneity corrections.
Treatment may alternatively  be delivered using proton beam therapy.  In that 
case, all of the dosimetric guidelines described herein must be followed after converting 
physical dose to gray-equivalent (GyE).
5.1.3  Target Coverage
The goal  is to deliver conformal treatment that minimizes normal tissue 
irradiation.  As a guideline, a conformity index (ratio of the volume of the prescription 
isodose surface to the PTV) of < 1.[ADDRESS_1258622] 95% of each PTV.  The minimum PTV dose must not fall 
below 90% of the prescription dose.  The maximum dose must not exceed a value that 
is 115% of the highest prescribed dose, and the hot spot must be located within the 
PTV.

5.2  Concurrent Chemotherapy
5.2.1  Concurrent Chemotherapy Dosing
Chemotherapy will be administered weekly concurrent with radiation on the same 
day each week.  Carboplatin (AUC 2, IV) and Paclitaxel (45 mg/m2, IV) will be started on week 1 of thoracic radiotherapy and will be continued weekly for 5 weeks. Patients may receive chemotherapy on any day of the week from Monday to Friday, but the day of administration should remain constant during the course of chemoradiotherapy. A 1-day shift in the day of weekly chemotherapy infusion will be allowed if necessary.
Paclitaxel 45 mg/m
2 IV will be given by [CONTACT_897958]. Paclitaxel is mixed in 
non-PVC containers per the usual guidelines of the pharmacy.  Carboplatin will be given at AUC 2 (calculated using the Calvert formula) over 1/2 hour immediately after paclitaxel.  GFR will be calculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula.  A > 10% change in the serum creatinine will warrant a recalculation of the carboplatin and paclitaxel doses.
Calvert Formula
Calculated dose of carboplatin (mg) = target AUC x (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) + 25)
Cockroft-Gault Formula
GFR = (140 – Age) x Weight (in kg) x 0.85 (females only) ÷ (72 x Serum Creatinine (in mg/dL))
Prior to receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel, all patients should receive standard 
premedication.  One standard that is recommended is:
Dexamethasone [ADDRESS_1258627]

Version 6;  Date 5/6/155.4  Treatment  Modifications
If treatment is  interrupted due to a non-dose-limiting adverse event or any reason 
other than toxicity, such as a holiday, bad weather, or a transportation problem, the 
duration of therapy will be extended accordingly. If a patient misses a day of radiation 
and chemotherapy, then the weekly chemotherapy should be delivered the next day 
and the missed radiation fraction will be given after the completion of planned 
treatments.
Patients who  exhibit distant tumor progression will discontinue all study 
procedures and will be medically managed. These patients will continue to be followed 
as specified in the protocol.  These patients may be treated with other agents. Patients 
who exhibit local-regional tumor progression will complete radiation as described in 
Section 6.0. Tissue confirmation is recommended to confirm the progressive disease in 
locoregional or metastatic sites.
5.4.1  RT Interruption
Recommended treatment  modifications for in-field RT toxicities are detailed 
below.  If treatment  is interrupted for > 2 weeks, protocol treatment should be 
discontinued. Follow up and data collection will continue as specified in the protocol. RT 
should be held for all Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity in or outside the treatment field 
and resumed only when toxicity is ≤ Grade 2.  Further treatment off protocol is at the 
discretion of the treating physician. If the patient experiences esophagitis so that IV fluid 
support is needed, insertion of a feeding tube should be considered.  RT should be 
discontinued if Grade 4 pulmonary toxicity occurs.

Version 6;  Date 5/6/15Based on  data we have generated from the ACRIN 6668 / RTOG 0235 dataset, 
approximately 35% of patients can be expected to have significant (SUVmax>6.0) 
residual hypermetabolic activity on post-treatment PET/CT after chemoRT for LA-
NSCLC.  We hypothesize that this rate will be less than or equal to 15% for patients 
treated on this protocol.  Based on this assumption, [ADDRESS_1258634]-treatment PET/CT scans 
will be required to provide 80% power to detect an improvement in PET response rate 
at a target error rate of 5% and actual error rate of 0.046.  If [ADDRESS_1258635] significant residual activity, we will accept the hypothesis that the rate of residual 
activity is less than or equal to 15%.  Adjusting for a 10% dropout rate, a total of 39 
patients will  be accrued to this study. 
 
7.2  Primary Efficacy  Analysis
Descriptive statistics  of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be 
presented. The demographic and clinical characteristics will be compared between 
responders and non-responder’s using chi-square statistics or Fishers exact test for 
categorical variable and t-test or Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test for continuous 
variables. The efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint, which is the metabolic 
response of all pulmonary lesions and thoracic lymph nodes on post-treatment PET/CT 
imaging, will be performed using single sample pre-post proportion test.

9.2  Source Documents
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, 
or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents   Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial.
9.3  Case Report Forms
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the 
study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
10.0  DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARDS
The Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Albert Einstein Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) has the responsibility for ensuring data and safety monitoring along with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_897953].  The primary functions of the AECC DSMC are as follows:
1.  To review and ensure protocol compliance with dose escalation in phase I trials 
IRB NUMBER: 2013-252
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 02/16/2017
47
Version 6;  Date 5/6/152. To review/assure protocol  compliance for all trials that have two-stage phase II 
designs, 
3. Reviewing  all internal and external serious adverse reports, investigator alerts, 
action letters, and other safety reports for trials being performed at AECC-
affiliated institutions and; 
4. To implement  and to determine the adequacy of DSM plans of all approved 
protocols. 
The DSMC  is an independent committee and meets on a monthly basis.  During its 
monthly meeting, the DSMC will review serious (grade 3 or higher) adverse events from 
this study.  In the event that the DSMC decides that a revision is warranted, the 
committee will immediately notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_37105].  The DSMC has 
the authority to close trials to patient accrual should the risk to patients be excessive or 
outweigh the potential benefits of the study.  All study suspensions and closures will be 
forwarded to the IRB/CCI and study sponsor from the DSMC.  
11.0  ADVERSE EVENTS
An adverse  event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject and does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with study treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of treatment.  During clinical trials, AEs can be 
spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a subject. 
AEs will  be recorded in the case report form for the duration of the trial, 
regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial intervention or 
medication. All AEs considered related to trial intervention or medication will be followed 
until resolution, even if this occurs post-trial.
11.1  Adverse Event  Definitions
Adverse Event  (AE):  any new, undesirable medical experience or change of an existing 
condition that  occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered product-
related.
Serious Adverse  Event (SAE):  An AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes  (CFR 312.32)
IRB NUMBER: 2013-252
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 02/16/2017
48
Version 6; Date 5/6/15Death
Life-threatening adverse experience
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_805941], transfusional support, disease staging/re-staging procedures, thoracentesis / paracentesis, or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other serious events
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Congenital anomaly / birth defect. 
The definition of SAE also includes important medical event.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30506].  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of treatment should be considered an important medical event.
The definition of “related” is that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug or the 
study intervention caused the adverse experience.
Unexpected Adverse Event:  An AE that is not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure 
or package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the 
investigator's brochure or package insert.
Life-threatening:  Any adverse experience that places the patient or subject, in the view 
of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
AEs will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (Appendix B). A list of AEs that have occurred or might occur can be found in sections above.

Version 6; Date 5/6/1511.[ADDRESS_1258640] notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793927] a patient.  In general, SAEs assessed as clearly being due to disease progression, and not due to study drug(s), should be excluded from AE reporting.  Study-specific clinical outcomes of death because of disease progression are exempt from SAE reporting, unless the investigator deems them related to use of the study drug.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793928].
The following steps will be taken to report promptly and document accurately any SAE, 
even if it may not appear to be related to the study treatment:
Report the SAE to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793929], telephone or fax 
within [ADDRESS_1258641] the SAE accurately on the AE page of the patient’s CRF.
Using the standard IRB-SAE report form, submit all known patient information 
within 24 hours of SAE occurrence to the clinical trial office to submit to IRB and DSMB.  Date and sign each report before submission.  Include the following information (or as much as possible to obtain and still report the event within 24 hours): 
oStudy protocol number and indication
oStudy site and investigator’s identification
oPatient’s ID (patient number and initials), age or date of birth, and sex
oDate of enrollment
oDescription of SAE, including date of onset and duration, severity, and 
outcome
oDate of first and most recent (last) dose administered
oAction taken regarding study treatment
oRelationship of SAE to study treatment
oConcomitant medications, including regimen and indication
oIntervention, including concomitant medications used to treat SAE

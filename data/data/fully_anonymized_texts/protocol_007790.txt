Analysis Populations 
x Intent-to-Treat Population – The intent-to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized 
subjects.  The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population with the Last 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation method for missing values.  The ITT population may also be analyzed with observed data only (i.e., without LOCF) to assess 
sensitivity.  Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed as randomized. 
x Per Protocol Population – The per protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the ITT 
population who do not have significant protocol deviations and who complete the study.  
Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database lock and unmasking.  The PP 
population will be analyzed using observed data only for efficacy variables.  Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated. HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

one dose of the investigational product.  The safety population will be analyzed for all 
safety assessments.  Subjects in the Safety population will be analyzed as treated.  
Sample Size 
This study is expected to enroll 50 subjects in each of the three treatment arms, for a total of 150 
randomized subjects.  Assuming a 10% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_789836] deviation in the change from baseline for the pre-CAE® inferior 
corneal fluorescein staining of 0.[ADDRESS_789837] 90% 
power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_789838] 90% power to detect a mean difference of 0.80 units in the change from 
baseline for the pre-CAE® ocular discomfort as assessed by [CONTACT_80690]® Ocular Discomfort 
Scale, assuming a standard deviation of 1.15 units.  Therefore the power for each endpoint for both 
the sign and the symptom is 81%, assuming independence between the endpoints.  The power for 
both the sign and the symptom in both active treatments is 66%, assuming independence of 
treatments. 
Multiplicity Consideration: 
For success, significance is required for both the primary sign and the primary symptom, and for 
both active treatments, hence no multiplicity adjustment is necessary.  
Primary Efficacy Analyses:  
For both coprimary endpoints, pre-CAE® change from baseline will be calculated as visit – baseline 
such that a positive difference indicates a worsening of dry eye signs.  In addition, treatment 
comparisons between active and placebo will be calculated as active – placebo, such that a negative 
result indicates a better score for the active treatment (i.e., the active treatment had a smaller 
increase in dry eye signs than the placebo group).   The coprimary endpoints and changes from 
baseline will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, min and max) by [CONTACT_3232]. 
ANCOVA models will be used to compare the change from baseline in the pre-CAE
® inferior 
corneal fluorescein staining at Day 57 (Visit 6), as measured on the Ora Calibra® scale, between 
each dose of 0.25% and 0.10% HL036 Ophthalmic Solution and Placebo.  The ANCOVA models will include terms for baseline pre-CAE
® inferior corneal fluorescein staining and study site.  In 
addition, the study site by [CONTACT_597736] a separate model to evaluate how 
the treatment effect may differ across study sites.  As supportive analyses, two-sample t-tests and 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests will also be conducted.  The primary analysis will use MCMC multiple 
imputation to have a full accounting of the ITT population at the Day 57 visit, as described in Section 10.4.3.  
Ocular discomfort will be analyzed similarly.  ANCOVA models will be used to compare the 
change from baseline in the pre-CAE
® ocular discomfort scores at Day 57 (Visit 6), as measured on 
the Ora Calibra® Ocular Discomfort Scale, between each dose of 0.25% and 0.10% HL036 
Ophthalmic Solution and Placebo.  The ANCOVA models will include terms for baseline (Visit 2) 
ocular discomfort and study site.  In addition, the study site by [CONTACT_597737] a separate model to evaluate how the treatment effect may differ across sites.  As 
supportive analyses, two-sample t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests will also be conducted.   
Secondary Efficacy Analyses: 
The continuous and ordinal secondary efficacy variables collected at each visit will be summarized HL036 Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Trial Protocol HL036-DED-US-P201Sponsor: HanAll Biopharma, Co., Lt d

descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, min and max) by [CONTACT_3232], and 
analyzed with two-sample t-tests comparing each of the active treatment groups to placebo.  All 
visit-based data will be analyzed at each visit and change from baseline.  Change scores from pre- 
to post-CAE® will be calculated as Post-CAE® score – Pre-CAE® score.  A Wilcoxon rank sum test 
and an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline and site will also be assessed where appropriate.  
No imputation will be performed for secondary efficacy variables. 
Fluorescein staining by [CONTACT_459735], Lissamine green staining by [CONTACT_11338], TFBUT, conjunctival 
redness, unanesthetized Schirmer’s test, Drop comfort assessment, OSDI, ocular discomfort and dry 
eye symptoms, ocular discomfort during CAE®, pre- to post-CAE® changes, and changes from 
baseline in these measures will be analyzed by [CONTACT_597738]-sample t-tests and Wilcoxon rank 
sum tests, as appropriate.   
The worst symptom for each subject will be identified as the symptom with the highest average 
score during the run-in period (Days -14 to - 1) as recorded in the subject diary.  The worst 
symptom and each individual symptom will be analyzed per day using a two-sample t-test. 
Additionally, the average score for the worst symptom and each individual symptom will also be 
analyzed separately using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
Safety Variables 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  Frequencies and percentages of 
subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing 
premature discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].  An AE is treatment emergent if it 
occurs or worsens after the first dose of study treatment. Furthermore, frequencies will be given of 
subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], by [CONTACT_6657], by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximal severity, by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and 
strongest relationship, and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, maximal severity, and strongest 
relationship.  Separate analyses will be performed for ocular specific and all AEs (including 
systemic). 
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundoscopy, and 
intraocular pressure will be summarized by [CONTACT_72082]. 
Changes or shifts from baseline will also be summarized where appropriate.  For assessments 
performed by [CONTACT_72067], study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately.  In addition, shifts 
from baseline to worst on-treatment value for ocular safety assessments will be summarized. 
Immunogenicity will be summarized using discrete summary statistics.  Counts and proportions 
will be presented by [CONTACT_3232].  Exact 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals 
will be presented.  Treatment groups will be compared using Fisher’s Exact Test, and exact 95% 
confidence intervals for the pairwise proportion differences will be constructed.

[ADDRESS_789845] dry eye, with a 
projected 40% increase in numbe r of patients affected by [ZIP_CODE]-3. With the aging 
population in the [LOCATION_002] and other count ries of the developed world, and with 
increasing computer use, dry eye is expected  to become more prevalent and finding a 
treatment is becoming more importan t4. 
HL036 ophthalmic solution is a molecularly engineered TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) 
fragment (HL036337).  Molecule fragmentation and engineering techniques are applied 
for enhanced tissue distribution, increased stability and potency.  
HL036337 is a TNFR1 fragment composed of 171 amino acids, from 41 ~ [ADDRESS_789846] histidine, 56th histidine, 58th arginine, 59th histidine, and 122nd lysine 
with valine, methionine, pheny lalanine, proline, glycine, and asparagine respectively. 
HL036 eye drops demonstrated potent anti-in flammatory effects in a carrageenan-
induced acute in vivo model of inflammati on, and significant efficacy in a collagen-
induced arthritis model.  HL036 ophthalmic solution has also been shown to cause 
statistically significant clinical improvements in a dry eye animal model.

1.2 PREVIOUS CLINICAL STUDIES 
There is no information on the clinical efficacy of HL036 in dry eye. 
One Phase 1 clinical trial aimed to assess the safety, local tolerance, and pharmacokinetic 
properties of HL036 by [CONTACT_12523] [INVESTIGATOR_597721]036 twice in one day (12 
hours apart) into left eyes of  healthy male volunteers, while  right eyes received vehicle 
placebo. 
One drop (40 μl) of HL036 at either the 0.5 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL concentration topi[INVESTIGATOR_597722]. Sa fety and local tolerance assessment results 
showed no clinically significant observations. 
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE 
HL036 ophthalmic solution is a molecularly engineered tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
receptor 1 (TNFR1) fragment (active pharmaceutical ingredient also denoted as 
HL036337).  Molecule fragmentation and en gineering techniques are applied for 
enhanced tissue distribution, in creased stability and potency. 
Anti-TNF molecules have been approved for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s diseas es.  They are also prescribed for off-
label use for uveitis, dry eye disease, macu lar degeneration, sciatic  neuralgia, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma. 
The role of TNF as a major cytokine in dry eye provides a rationale for use of TNF 
inhibitors in this disease.  However, the majority of TNF inhibitors are antibody-based 
with a large molecular size (~150 kDa) that  limits tissue penetration.  Considering the 
limited ocular distribution and excessive toxicity of TNF-inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_597723], HL036 Ophthalmic Solution wa s developed as a TNF-inhibitor with 
increased penetration and distribution a nd minimal systemic side effects.   HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

1.4 SUMMARY OF OVERALL RISKS AND BENEFITS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One Phase 1 clinical trial aimed to assess the safety, local tolerance, and pharmacokinetic 
properties of HL036 by [CONTACT_12523] [INVESTIGATOR_597721]036 twice in one day (12 
hours apart) into left eyes of  healthy male volunteers, while right eyes received vehicle 
placebo. 
The investigational product was administered to [ADDRESS_789847] B010 was found to be 
“unlikely.”  
There was no significant difference in the num ber of subjects with AEs or the frequency 
of AEs between treatment groups. The most  frequent suspected AE was conjunctival 
hyperemia. There was no serious AE or une xpected adverse drug reaction reported, and 
no clinically significant change s were observed in vital signs,  physical examinations, and 
medical laboratory tests. 
Local tolerance was assessed through obs ervation of ophthalmologic symptoms, and 
symptoms were either none or mild. There we re no moderate or severe ophthalmologic 
symptoms observed. Ophthalmologic symptoms that occurred more than once in this trial 
were dryness, ocular burning or pain and conjunctival hyperemia.  
In conclusion, 1 drop (40 μl) of HL036 at either the 0.5 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL 
concentration was topi[INVESTIGATOR_597724]. There was no 
clinically significant systemic absorption observed in any of the subjects. Safety and local 
tolerance assessment results showed no clinically significant observations. Overall, topi[INVESTIGATOR_597725] 0.5 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of HL036 in healthy subjects 
twice a day is unlikely to result in any clinically significant local tolerance issue. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of 0.10% and 0.25% 
HL036 Ophthalmic Solutions to placebo for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of 
dry eye. HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES 
The clinical hypotheses for this stud y are that 0.10% or 0.25% HL036 Ophthalmic 
Solution is superior to placebo for the pr imary endpoints of signs and symptoms, as 
follows:  
x Pre- CAE® inferior corneal fluorescein staining score on the Ora Calibra® scale, 
measured by [CONTACT_80689] (Visit 2) to Visit 6; 
x Pre- CAE® ocular discomfort score on the Ora Calibra® Ocular Discomfort Scale, 
measured by [CONTACT_80689] (Visit 2) to Visit 6; 
4 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, ra ndomized, prospective, double–masked, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-arm design with block enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms at Visit 2 and will be instructed to 
follow a BID-dosing regimen:  
x HL036 0.25% Ophthalmic Solution (N~50)  
x HL036 0.10% Ophthalmic Solution (N~50)  
x Placebo, HL036 Ophthal mic Solution (N~50) 
This study is multicenter, randomized, pr ospective, double–masked, placebo–controlled, 
parallel-arm design with bl ock enrollment. Approximately 150 subjects will be randomly 
assigned to one of the three treatment groups  (1:1:1) to receive e ither HL036 Ophthalmic 
Solution (0.10%, 0.25%) or placebo solution as  topi[INVESTIGATOR_597726]. Subjects, S ponsor, CRO and site personnel w ill be masked to treatment 
assignment.  
During the screening period, two  exposures to the CAE
® will be conducted to 
ascertain eligibility to enter the study.  T hose who qualify will be randomized to receive 
study drug in a double-masked fashion for 56 days. Subjects will self-administer drops 
twice daily and will complete daily diary assessments as instructed. 
At Visits 4 (Day 15), 5 (Day 29) and 6 (Day 57), CAE® exposure will occur, with pre-
CAE®, during CAE® (symptoms only) and post-CAE® assessments of ocular signs and 
symptoms. At Visit 3 only, no CAE® exposure will occur but signs and symptoms will be 
assessed. 
The total number of expected participants, in cluding screen failures, is approximately 375 
subjects.

8.1.[ADDRESS_789860] meet all inclusion a nd none of the exclusion criteria. 
8.1.5 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups: 
Prior to initiation of study run-in (at Visit 1), each subject who qualifies for entry will be 
assigned a screening number. All screening numbers will be assigned in strict numerical 
sequence at a site and no numbers will be skipped or omitted. If all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met at Vi sits [ADDRESS_789861] will then be assigned 
a randomization number at the end of Visit 2.  
A randomization schedule will be generated using block randomization. Blocks of 
randomization numbers will be distributed to sites, such that there will be an approximate 
equal number of subjects assigned to each of  the three treatment arms at each site. The 
site staff will dispense to the patient the study kit labeled with the corresponding randomization number. The randomization number will be recorded on the patient’s 
source document and eCRF. A new kit will be dispensed at Visits 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_789862]’s randomization. The visit [ADDRESS_789863]’s source document and corr esponding electronic case report form (eCRF)

In the subject daily diary, if more than 20%  of Dose Taken boxes are checked “no”, left 
blank, or missing for a diary period, a subject will be deemed  non-compliant and a diary 
deviation will be recorded. If more than 20% of the total diary symptom assessments for 
that dosing period are missed, these subjects will be deemed non-compliant and a diary symptom assessment deviation will be recorded. These guidelines will be used by [CONTACT_597739]’s necessary compliance for the study and for 
recording deviations from this compliance.

Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for discontinuation will be made 
to Ora and/or study sponsor and will be clearly documented on the eCRF. 
Discontinued subjects will not be replaced. 
8.7 STUDY TERMINATION  
The study may be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_093], the sponsor, and/or Ora with 
appropriate notification. 
8.[ADDRESS_789875]’s partic ipation will involve 6 visits over approximately a 10-week 
(~70 days) period (56 days of treatment and 14 days pre-screening). 
8.9 MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
During the course of the study a  monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, assess study drug/device accountability, and ensure the 
study is being conducted according to the pe rtinent regulatory requirements.  The 
review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality.  Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies,  quality assurance and or its 
designees may carry out on-site inspections a nd/or audits which may include source data 
checks.  Therefore direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits.  All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, 
state, and federal laws apply. HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

[ADDRESS_789876] (IP) in humans, whethe r or not considered IP-related. An AE can 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg,  an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associ ated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about 
causality. An AE can arise from any use of the IP (eg, off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) and fr om any route of administration, formulation, 
or dose, including an overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or use 
of a medical device, including medical device failure, subject characteristics that may 
impact medical device performance (eg, anatomical limitations), and therapeutic parameters (eg, energy applied, sizing, dose release) associated with medical device. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_70579] t and/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_587567], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate 
pages of the CRF. Any clinically relevant dete rioration in clinical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possibl e, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as 1 comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date  of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to IP, action(s) taken, seriousness, a nd outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_597740] d by [CONTACT_597741].  
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The 
assessment of severity is made  irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
x Mild :  Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities. 
x Moderate :  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
x Severe :  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_789877] 
The relationship of each AE to the IP shoul d be determined by [CONTACT_80694]: HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 of 81
x Suspected :  A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE can be further defined as:  
¾ Definite:   Relationship exists when the AE  follows a reasonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_597742][INVESTIGATOR_597728]. 
¾ Probable:   Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_590198]. 
¾ Possible:   Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of administration, but coul d also have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_121641] r drugs administered to the subject. 
x Not Suspected :  A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. A 
not suspected AE cab further be defined as: 
¾ Not Related:   Concurrent illness, concurrent  medication, or other known cause 
is clearly responsible for the AE, the ad ministration of the IP and the occurrence 
of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to IP has not occurred. 
Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the AE 
include:  a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with IP exposure (eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an even t that is not commonly associated with IP 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in th e population exposed to the IP (eg, tendon 
rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying diseas e or condition under investigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study popul ation independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group. 
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be deter mined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations: 
x Unexpected :  an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or Report of 
Prior Investigations (ROPI) or is not listed at  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. 
x Expected :  an AE that is listed in the IB or ROPI [INVESTIGATOR_253675]. HL036 Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Trial Protocol HL036-DED-US-P201Sponsor: HanAll Biopharma, Co., Lt d

x Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB or ROPI [INVESTIGATOR_597729] a class of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological/ mechanic al (or other) properties of the product, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occu rring with the particular product under 
investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination. 
9.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of  either the investigator or sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death; 
x A life-threatening AE; 
Note:  An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at  immediate risk of 
death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411]; 
Note:  The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission 
(even if less than 24 hours).  For chr onic or long-term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597730]:  emergency room visits; 
outpatient/same-day/ambulatory proced ures; observation/short stay units; 
rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597731]. 
x A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
Note:  A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (eg, 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic 
nerve). HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

9.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction 
All adverse events that are ‘suspected’ and ‘ unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora, the 
study sponsor and the IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_789879] be recorded on the appropriate case report forms.  The investigator is 
obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by [CONTACT_241531]/or the sponsor in 
addition to that information reported on the case report form.  All subjects experiencing 
a serious adverse event must be fo llowed up and the outcome reported. 
In the event of a serious adverse event, the investigator must notify Ora and the sponsor 
immediately; obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, 
information, and medical judgments from colle agues who assisted in the treatment and 
follow-up of the subject; provide Ora and the st udy sponsor with a complete case history, 
which includes a statement as to whether the ev ent was or was not susp ected to be related 
to the use of the study drug; and inform the IRB of the adverse event within their 
guidelines for reporting serious adverse events.

9.4 PROCEDURES FOR UNMASKING (IF APPLICABLE) 
All subjects, investigators, and study pers onnel involved with the conduct of the study 
will be masked with regard to treatment assignments. When medically necessary, the 
investigator may need to determine what trea tment arm has been assigned to a subject. 
When possible (i.e., in non-emergent situations ), Ora and/or the study sponsor should be 
notified before unmasking study drug. The unmasked subject will be discontinued from 
the study.

If the Investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE (i.e., 
resolution, change in condition, or new tr eatment), a new SAE/Unanticipated Report 
Form must be completed and faxed to Ora w ithin 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the 
new information. The original SAE form is not  to be altered. The report should describe 
whether the event has resolved or con tinues and how the event was treated. 
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES 
10.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
The following analysis populations will be considered: 
x Intent-to-Treat Population – The intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes all 
randomized subjects. The primary analysis  will be performed on the ITT population 
with the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation method for missing 
values. The ITT population may also be an alyzed with observed data only (i.e., HL036 Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Trial Protocol HL036-DED-US-P201Sponsor: HanAll Biopharma, Co., Lt d

without LOCF) and using multiple imputa tion methods to assess sensitivity. 
Subjects in the ITT population w ill be analyzed as randomized. 
x Per Protocol Population – The per protocol  (PP) population includes subjects in the 
ITT population who do not have significant protocol deviations  and who complete 
the study. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database lock and unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed using observed data only for 
efficacy variables. Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated. 
x Safety Population – The safety populati on includes all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of the inve stigational product. Th e safety population 
will be analyzed for all safety assessments . Subjects in the Sa fety population will be 
analyzed as treated.  
The statistical analysis of safety data w ill be performed for the safety population.  The 
analysis of baseline and efficacy data w ill be performed for the ITT population.  The 
primary efficacy analysis will also be performed on the PP population as sensitivity 
analyses. 
10.2  STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
The statistical hypotheses are stated in terms of one-sided hypotheses,  although statistical 
testing will be two-sided. 
H01:  There is no difference between HL036 ophthalmic solution (0.25% or 0.10%) 
and placebo in the change from baseline of the pre-CAE® inferior corneal fluorescein 
staining at Day 57 (Visit 6), using the Ora Calibra® scale. 
H11:  The change from baseline of the pre-CAE® inferior corneal fl uorescein staining 
at Day 57 (Visit 6) using the Ora Calibra® scale is less with HL036 ophthalmic 
solution (0.25% or 0.10%) than with placebo. 
H02:  There is no difference between HL036 ophthalmic solution (0.25% or 0.10%) 
and placebo in the change from baseline of the pre-CAE® ocular discomfort evaluated 
at Visit 6, using the Ora Calibra® Ocular Discomfort Scale. 
H12:  The change from baseline of the pre-CAE® ocular dryness at Visit 6 using the 
Ora Calibra® Ocular Discomfort Scale is less with HL036 ophthalmic solution 
(0.25% or 0.10%) than with placebo. 
10.3  SAMPLE SIZE 
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a statistically significant difference 
between the active treatments and placebo.  
This study is expected to enroll 50 subjects in each of the three treatment arms, for a total 
of 150 randomized subjects.  Assuming a 10%  drop out rate, 45 subjects per group are 
expected to complete the study.   HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

[ADDRESS_789881] deviation in the change from baseline for the pre-CAE® 
inferior corneal fluorescein staining of 0.[ADDRESS_789882] 90% power to detect a differen ce of 0.[ADDRESS_789883] 90% power to detect a 
mean difference of 0.80 units in the change from baseline for the pre-CAE® ocular 
discomfort as assessed by [CONTACT_80690]® Ocular Discomfort Scale, assuming a 
standard deviation of 1.15 units.  Using an  analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) for 
each primary endpoint should yield standard de viations no greater than those from a two-
sample t-test.  Therefore, the power for each  endpoint for both the sign and the symptom 
is 81%, assuming independence between the e ndpoints.  The power for both the sign 
and the symptom in both active treatments is 66%, assuming independen ce of treatments. 
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
10.4.1  General Considerations 
The quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, 
median, standard deviati on, minimum and maximum. The qualitative variab les will be 
summarized using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presen ted by [CONTACT_1570].  Su mmaries will be provided for 
demographics, baseline medical history, conc urrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and subject disposition. 
For the purpose of summarization, medical hist ory, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and adverse 
events will be coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined as the last measure prior to the initiation of study 
treatment, usually at Visit 2.  If  a measure is taken both pre-CAE® and post-CAE®, the 
baseline will be the time point matched value at Visit 2.  For measures from daily subject diaries, baseline is defined as the av erage of all days during the run-in period.  
For changes from pre-CAE
® to post-CAE® post first treatment, the change from pre-
CAE® to post-CAE® at Visit 2 will be considered the baseline value. 
All primary and secondary analyses will be  2-sided at a significance level of 0.05. 
10.4.2  Unit of Analysis 
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both ey es.  For efficacy endpoints, the unit of 
analysis will be the study eye, or the “worst eye,” as defined by [CONTACT_716]: 
Study Eye/Worst Eye: Eyes are eligible for analysis if they meet all of the inclusion 
criteria.  In the case that both eyes are eligible for analysis, the worst eye will be the eye 
with worse (higher) inferior corneal staining pre-CAE® at Visit 2.  If the inferior corneal 
staining is the same in both eyes, then the worst eye will be the eye with the highest HL036 Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Trial Protocol HL036-DED-US-P201Sponsor: HanAll Biopharma, Co., Lt d
31 OCTOBER 2017
CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 of 81
ocular discomfort pre-CAE® at Visit 2.  If the ocular discomfort is the same in both eyes, 
then the right eye will be selected as the worst eye. 
10.4.3  Missing Data 
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) multiple imputation methodology for missing values.  An analysis using observed data only will also be performed for the primary efficacy variables.  As additional sensitivity analyses, Last Observ ation Carried Forward (LOCF) methodology 
and imputation via pattern mixture models will also be used to impute missing data for the analyses of the primary efficacy variables. 
For the LOCF analyses of the primary efficacy variables at Day 57 (Visit 6), the last 
value from the previous visits will be carried forward, matching pre-CAE
® or post-CAE® 
time points.  A pre-CAE® time point will never be imputed for a post-CAE® value, and 
vice versa.     
No secondary efficacy endpoints or  safety endpoints will be imputed. 
10.4.4  Multiplicity Consideration 
For success, significance is required for both the primary sign and the primary symptom, 
and for both active treatments, hence no multiplicity adjustment is necessary. 
10.4.5  Primary Efficacy Analyses 
For both coprimary endpoints, pre-CAE® change from baseline will be calculated as visit 
– baseline such that a positive difference indicates a worsening of dry eye signs or symptoms.  In addition, treatment compar isons between active and placebo will be 
calculated as active – placebo, such that a ne gative result indicates a better score for the 
active treatment (i.e., the active treatment had a smaller increase in dry eye signs or symptoms than the placebo group).  The coprimary endpoints and changes from baseline will be summari zed descriptively (n, mean, sta ndard deviation, median, min and 
max) by [CONTACT_3232]. 
ANCOVA models will be used to compare th e change from baseline in the pre-CAE
® 
inferior corneal fluorescein staining at Day 57 (Visit 6), as measured on the Ora Calibra® 
scale, between each dose of 0.25% and 0.10% HL036 Ophthalmic Solution and Placebo.  
The ANCOVA models will include terms for baseline pre-CAE® inferior corneal 
fluorescein staining and study site.   In add ition, the study site by [CONTACT_597743] a separate model to evaluate how the treatment effect may differ across study sites.  As supportive analyses , two-sample t-test s and Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests will also be c onducted.  The primary analysis will use MCMC multiple imputation 
to have a full accounting of the ITT populati on at the Day 57 visit, as described in 
Section 10.4.3.  HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 of 81
Ocular dryness will be analyzed similarly.   ANCOVA models will be used to compare 
the change from baseline in the pre-CAE® ocular discomfort score at Day 57 (Visit 6), as 
measured on the Ora Calibra® Ocular Discomfort Scale, between each dose of 0.25% and 
0.10% HL036 Ophthalmic Solution and Place bo.  The ANCOVA models will include 
terms for baseline (Visit 2) ocular  discomfort and study site.   In addition, the study site 
by [CONTACT_597736] a separate model to evaluate how the 
treatment effect may differ across sites.  As  supportive analyses, two-sample t-tests and 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests w ill also be conducted.   
10.4.6  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The continuous and ordinal sec ondary efficacy variables coll ected at each visit will be 
summarized descriptively (n, me an, standard deviation, medi an, min and max) by [CONTACT_121981], and analyzed with two-sa mple t-tests comparing each of the active 
treatment groups to placebo.  All visit-based data  will be analyzed at each visit and 
change from baseline.  Change scores from pre- to post-CAE® will be calculated as 
Post-CAE® score – Pre-CAE® score.  A Wilcoxon rank sum test and an ANCOVA 
model adjusting for baseline and site will also be assessed where appropriate.  No imputation will be performed for secondary efficacy variables. 
Fluorescein staining by [CONTACT_459735], lissamine green staining by [CONTACT_11338], TFBUT, 
conjunctival redness, unanesth etized Schirmer’s test, dr op comfort assessment, OSDI, 
ocular discomfort and dry eye symp toms, ocular discomfort during CAE
®, pre- to post-
CAE® changes, and changes from baseline in these measures will be analyzed by [CONTACT_597744]-sample t-tests and Wilcox on rank sum tests, as appropriate. 
The worst symptom for each subject will be identified as the symptom with the highest 
average score during the run-in period (Days -14 to -1) as recorded in the subject diary.  
The worst symptom and each individual symptom will be analyzed per day using a two-
sample t-test.  Additionally, the average score for the worst symptom and each individual symptom will also be analyzed separately using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
10.4.7  Safety Variables 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and 
percentages of subjects with treatment-emerg ent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, 
and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided by [CONTACT_1570]. An 
AE is treatment emergent if it 1) occurs af ter the first dose of randomized study treatment 
or 2) if it is present prior to receipt of ra ndomized study treatment but worsens in severity 
or increases in frequency after the first dose of randomized study treatment. Furthermore, 
frequencies will be given of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_6657]; by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximal severity; by  [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term for treatment-related AEs; by [CONTACT_597745]; and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and day of onset. Separate analyses will be performed for ocular specific a nd all AEs (including systemic). HL036 Ophthalmic Solution

APPENDIX 2: EXAMINATION PROCEDURES, TESTS, 
EQUIPMENT, AND TECHNIQUES 
Visual Acuity Procedures (ETDRS Chart) 
LogMAR visual acuity (VA) must be a ssessed using an Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The proce dure used will be consistent with the 
recommendations provided for using the ETDR S eye chart. VA should be evaluated at 
the beginning of each visit in the study (ie, prior to slit-lamp examination). VA testing should be done with most recent correction. 
Equipment 
The VA chart to be used is the ETDRS chart.  If smaller reproduction (18" by 18", eg, 
from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are use d, the subject viewing distance should be 
exactly 10 feet (or as specified by [CONTACT_211575]). In ALL cases, for purposes of 
standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only the 'R' charts, and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be 
placed frontally and well-illuminated. 
Measurement Technique 
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing an gle. The right eye should be tested first. 
The subject should attempt to read each letter, line-by-line, left to right, beginning with 
line [ADDRESS_789898] identification of 
each letter. He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she  has given a definite 
response. 
If the subject changes a response (eg, 'that was a "C" not an "O"') before he has read 
aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted. If the subject changes a response 
having read the next letter, then the change  is not to be accepted. The examiner should 
never point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test. 
A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the subject 
says he or she cannot read a letter, he or she should be encouraged to guess. If the subject 
identifies a letter as [ADDRESS_789899] may be the only one read correctly . The number of letters missed or read 
incorrectly should be noted.  HL036 Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Trial Protocol HL036-DED-US-P201Sponsor: HanAll Biopharma, Co., Lt d
[ADDRESS_789900] line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as the base logMAR reading. 
To this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number 
of letters missed up to and included in the last line read. This total sum represents the logMAR VA for that eye. 
For Example: Subject co rrectly reads 4 of 5 letters on the 0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on 
the 0.1 line. 
Base logMAR = 0.1 
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as 
well as 0.1) = 4 
N x T (T=0.02) = 0.08 
Base logMAR + (N x T) = 0.1 + 0.08 
logMAR VA = 0.[ADDRESS_789901] be  consistently done using the same lighting 
conditions and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same correction 
cannot be used (ie, a subject forgets his glasses), the reason for the change in correction 
should be documented. 
Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy Procedures 
Slit lamp biomicroscopic observa tions will be graded as No rmal or Abnormal. Abnormal 
findings will be categorized as clinically significant (findings that may interfere with study parameters or otherwise confound the data as determined by [CONTACT_093]) or not 
clinically significant (NCS). The following will be examined:  
x Cornea  
x Conjunctiva 
x Anterior Chamber 
x Iris 
x Lens 
x Eyelid HL036 Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Trial Protocol HL036-DED-US-P201Sponsor: HanAll Biopharma, Co., Lt d
[ADDRESS_789902] ophthalmoscopy.  The investigator 
will make observations of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve.   
Observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal.  Abnormal findings that are 
clinically significant (as determined by [CONTACT_597751]) and those that are not clinically significant 
will be described. A dilated fundoscopy exa mination should be performed if retinal 
disease is detected.  
x Vitreous:  Examination should emphasize the visual axis.  
x Retina, Macula, Choroid:  Include an  observation of the retina and its blood 
vessels. Eyes should be excluded from the st udy if active inflammation is present.  
x Optic Nerve:  Significant damage or cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_597733]. 
It is recommended that tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic  solution be used to dilate subjects. 
The use of cyclopentolate 1% ophthalmic solu tion is recommended as  secondary dilating 
medication, should the need arise.   
Intraocular Pressure 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured in each eye by [CONTACT_597752].  A single measurement is made to obtain a determination of IOP.  The same  tonometer employing the Investigator’s 
standard technique will be used throughout the study.  In addition, all reasonable efforts 
will be made to have the same examiner obtain all IOP measurements for a given subject. 
Tear Collection 
Subjects will be seated at a reclined position. The investigator will collect tears for up to 
5 min from each eye. The right eye will be collected, followed by [CONTACT_358503]. Once tears 
are collected, they will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_555525] a separate tube for storage. Further details on tear collection process and storage will be found in a separate manual.

Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT)© 
The examiner will instill  solution into 
the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye.  To thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film, the subject will be instructed to blink several times.  In order to achieve maximum fluorescence, the examiner shoul d wait approximately  30 seconds after 
instillation before evaluating TFBUT.    
With the aid of a slit-lamp, the examiner will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting 
the time it takes to form micelles from the time that the eye is opened.  TFBUT will be measured in seconds using a stopwatch and a digital image recording system for the right 
eye followed by [CONTACT_358503].  A Wratten #12 yellow filter will be used to enhance the 
ability to grade TFBUT.   
For each eye, 2 measurements will be taken and averaged unless the 2 measurements are 
> 2 seconds apart and are each < [ADDRESS_789903] of  the 3 would be averaged.

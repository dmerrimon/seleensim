Version 11: 06- 20-[ADDRESS_1010746] pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a CDS intervention, exposing half of our clinician 
sample to the TUT Service+VM condition during clinical workflow, and 
comparing important outcome measures to those observed among the 
half exposed to the current usual care condition, TUT Service alone.  
 
Study Duration  The study will take place over a period of 2 years .  
Study Center(s) The Penn Presby[CONTACT_51616] (PPMC)  at the University of 
Pennsylvania will serve as the primary project location, and all 
recruitment and data collection efforts will be executed by [CONTACT_739696].  
Objectives  Specific Aim 1 : Assess whether including a standing order for 
prescription and management of varenicline (TUT Service+VM) within 
the workflow for patients ( cancer  or non- cancer)  identified as current 
smokers will significantly increase TUT engagement rates compared to current standard of care (TUT Service alone).  
 
Specific Aim 2: Assess whether clinicians exposed to the TUT 
Service+VM condition will be more effective at guiding reluctant patients 
toward TUT engagement than clinicians exposed to the TUT Service 
alone condition.  
 
Specific Aim 3 : Assess implementation preferences and barriers 
influencing effectiveness of usual care tobacco use treatment (TUT 
Service) + varenicline management (VM) applied within the cancer 
center.  
Number of Subjects  Recruitment will include projected subject recruitment totals of 52  
PPMC  clinicians .

1 Introduction 
To reduce all -cause and cancer -specific mortality, the 2014 Surgeon General’s Report emphasized the 
importance of effective tobacco use treatment (TUT) in within medical care, including cancer care. (1) 
Unfortunately, up to 50% of cancer patients who smoke prior to their diagnosis continue to do so after 
diagnosis and treatment.(2)  This observation has lead the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, (3) 
the American Society of Clinical Oncology ,(4) and the American Association for Cancer Research (5) to 
call for implementation strategies integrating TUT directly within oncology care. At this time, many cancer 
centers and oncology practices, and general inpatient medical facilities,  fall short of providing consistent, 
high- quality TUT; only half of cancer centers report that they identify tobacco use among patients, (6) and 
very few use systematic mechanisms to encourage TUT services. (5) 
 
In response, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) in 
2017 with support from the NCI Cancer Moonshot Program. (7) C3I’s aim is to help build and sustain TUT 
infrastructure across the nation’s cancer centers, ensuring that cancer patients are systematically screened for tobacco use and provided with evidence- based smoking cessation treatment. (8) Abramson 
Cancer Center’s work implementing the C3I tobacco use treatment service (TUT Service) has 
Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 6 
Version  11: 06- 20-[ADDRESS_1010748] (EHR), i.e. utilizing 
an “opt -out” rather than “opt -in” structure, increases TUT Service engagement in a manner similar to 
other contexts of cancer care. (9) Unfortunately, there remains unacceptable variation in clinician 
engagement rates. One significant reason for this variation is the individual clinician’s perceptions of 
treatment effectiveness. (10–12) A strategy used elsewhere involved utilizing opt -out orders aimed at 
maximizing the use of varenicline, i.e. “Varenicline Management” (VM). VM resulted in increased clinician 
utilization and patient cessation within a relatively controlled environment of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based cardiac and 
pulmonary care. (13,14)  However, it is unknown whether this type of intervention is generalizable to the 
complex, challenging environment of in patient oncology.  
 
Our research objective is to identify a simple, pragmatic, innovative way of enhancing TUT rates within 
inpatient medical care and, specifically, for oncology  inpatients . To investigate this possibility, we propose 
methods that will allow us to: 1) evaluate the impact of standing orders to initiate a varenicline 
management protocol within in patient medical treatment workflow  (that will include cancer and non-
cancer patients) and 2) assess the potential for an EHR -based intervention to affect patient TUT 
behaviors . 
1.1 Study Significance and Rationale  
 
Insights from prior work:  Our group has been engaged in efforts to understand the behavioral economic 
landscape informing clinician choice for several years. In a discrete choice analysis of alternatives 
determining physicians’ preferences for generic “smoking cessation strategies ,” effectiveness of the 
intervention was a statistically significant determinant of preference, with a relative utility 100- fold greater 
than either reimbursement rate or time saving capacity. This observation led us to examine the role of 
several cognitiv e biases in influencing physicians’ perceptions of success probabilities under conditions 
of uncertainty. (11) Educational efforts that minimize availability bias, omission bias, impact bias and 
focusing effect bias more successfully change physician TUT behaviors than interventions aimed solely at increasing knowledge. (33) Our group also identified implicit associations between smoking status and 
a culpability theme, influencing both the emotional characteristics of physician- smoker interactions and 
willingness to invest effort in TUT. (34) It is clear that complex and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_739682] a 
significant, perhaps unrecognized, role in physician decision- making around TUT.  
 Finding solutions:  Addressing a variety of 
complex motivations, within a diverse group of clinicians from multiple disciplines, with widely 
divergent perceptions about and experience 
with TUT, will require an approach that moves 
beyond traditional behavior change 
communicat ions (BCC), and integrates several 
different theory -based behavioral economic 
(BE) interventions within a cohesive theme (Fig 
1).(35) Our project represents an innovative 
approach to incorporating several BE insights 
into a simple, practical, system change that has 
the potential to meet a variety of needs. At baseline, our CDS facilitates identification of 
smoking status, and relies on harnessing social 
norms to encourage physicians to opt -in. Our varenicline management (VM) intervention (described in 
full below) adds several BE dimensions to the CDS, namely: 1) removal of obstacles to decision- making 

Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 7 
Version 11: 06- 20-2024  
 at the moment of treatment planning and order entry, 2) optimization of timing of information- giving by 
[CONTACT_739697], 3) simplifying treatment decisions by 
[CONTACT_739698][INVESTIGATOR_739683] (36), 4) 
using an opt -out choice architecture to take advantage of defaults, 5) maximizing clinician perceptions of 
effectiveness by [CONTACT_739699], and 6) acting as a very 
strong commitment device, encouraging both clinicians and patients to engage in important follow -up 
activities.  
 Why varenicline:  The initial 2006 reports of varenicline’s impact on tobacco dependence suggested 
superior efficacy to other available pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including nicotine replacement and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].(36,37)   Since then, varenicline has been generally well accepted as first -line therapy in a 
general population of smokers, with an abstinence odds ratio (OR) of ~2 when compared to other 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. (38) Cancer patients are not  more likely to spontaneously quit because of their illness 
(39), however studies have confirmed varenicline’s similar efficacy in cancer patients who continue to 
smoke. (40) Initial concerns over the possible neuropsychiatric side- effects of varenicline appear to have 
been overblown(41) , with the most recent and comprehensive data suggesting efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability, even in patients with pre -existing depression and psychiatric disease. (42) Perhaps most 
encouraging is the observation that varenicline is effective in promoting cessation even in patients 
unwilling to make a quit attempt at the time of treatment initiation, making it the ideal candidate for a CDS 
intervention designed to produc e minimal interruption to oncology treatment workflow. (43–45) 
 
2 Study Objectives  
 
The multi -disciplinary team assembled for this study  implement ed the ACC TUTS program. Drs. Schnoll 
and Leone oversee this program. This is a pragmatic study. T he specific aims  are described below.  
2.1 Primary Objectives 
 
The objective of this study is to examine a novel approach to improving the quality of care inpatients 
receive if they use tobacco (oncology and general inpatients) . 
 
Specific Aim 1:  Assess whether including a standing order for prescription and management of 
varenicline (TUT Service+VM) within the inpatient clinical workflow for cancer  and non- cancer  patients 
identified as current smokers will significantly increase TUT engagement rates compared to current 
standard of care (TUT Service alone).  Hypothesis:  Observed treatment engagement rates will be higher 
among clinicians exposed to TUT Service+VM than observed in clinicians exposed to TUT Service alone.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  Assess whether clinicians exposed to the TUT Service+VM condition will be more 
effective at guiding reluctant patients toward TUT engagement than clinicians exposed to the TUT Service alone condition. Hypothesis:  Rates of important TUT behaviors (e.g. treatment initiation, quit 
attempts, and others) observed among smoking patients of clinicians exposed to TUT Service+VM will be higher than those than observed among smoking patients of clinicians exposed to TUT Service alone.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  Assess implementation preferences and barriers influencing effectiveness of usual care 
tobacco use treatment (TUT Service) + varenicline management (VM) applied within the cancer center. 
Hypothesis:  Oncology specialists exposed to the TUT Service + VM condition will identify key facilitators 
and barriers to the implementation of the TUT Service + VM condition that can help guide subsequent dissemination efforts.

Version 11: 06- 20-2024  
 The goal of this study is to determine if the default for a varenicline order increases clinician referral to 
TUTS and/or the treatment of tobacco use.   At this point, many clinicians are turning the referral order off 
and patients are not receiving treatment for tobacco use. A default to prescribe treatment may help override barriers to both. While we are focused on cancer inpatients, we will assess the impact of the 
varenicline management intervention on cancer and non- cancer patients.  
 
Insights gained from this project form the basis of subsequent clinical trials assessing efficacy of novel 
implementation approaches improving uptake of evidence -based tobacco use treatment within the 
inpatient clinical setting. This study is significant because the model for promoting physician behavior change is simple and pragmatic yet has the potential to significantly impact patient survival and morbidity. 
The study builds on previous observations made through NCI and C.U.R.E. investments, expanding our understanding of novel pharmacologic approaches to tobacco cessation.   
3 Study Population and Duration of Participation  
 
The study will be conducted within  PPMC  in the University of Pennsylvania Health System ( UPHS).  
Participants will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739684] a cancer diagnosis at PPMC . This study will recruit individuals  age [ADDRESS_1010749]. Leone’s tobacco treatment program ; patient  
data are available in the EHR. If clinicians place the referral order (which is already in EPIC) to [CONTACT_484489]'s smoking cessation service, we collect standard information concerning smoking behavior that 
is standard clinical information, not research data (e.g., use of smoking cessation treatments, quit 
attempts). No patient data will be collected outside of what is available in the EHR (for clinicians in the 
study) or what is collected clinically when patients contact [CONTACT_739700]'s referral.  All patients receiving care from eligible clinicians will be assessed in this study as described 
above, those with or without cancer, so that we can test the impact of the intervention for cancer inpatients as well as for those inpatients without a cancer history.  
3.[ADDRESS_1010750] over a period of 2 years. Therefore f or 18 months , data will be collected and 
analyzed from the clinicians’ clinical practice on a quarterly basis.   
3.[ADDRESS_1010751] meet the following criteria for enrollment:  
1) Provides care for inpatients with a cancer diagnosis at PPMC  as a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739685],  
2) Prescribing  authority in Pennsylvania (i.e. physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant),  
 4) Has cared for at least one patient with tobacco use disorder in the 30 days prior to recruitment,  
5) English speaking

 3.4 Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusions include:  
1) Unwillingness  to prescribe varenicline, or  
2) Unwillingness  to assign varenicline management to TUT Service providers.   
 
There will be no exclusion based  on gender  or race/ethnicity,  consistent  with our demonstrated  ability  
to recruit  representative samples  in terms  of demographic  characteristics.  
3.[ADDRESS_1010752] quality medical care across the cancer care continuum to ~10,000 
patients/year, reducing the cancer burden within an ethnically diverse catchment area consisting of [ADDRESS_1010753] extensive experience implementing tobacco 
research within clinics and working with clinicians  on smoking cessation research (Schnoll et al., 2003; 
Schnoll et al., 2010). In a past study, we were able to recruit >200 primary care clinicians for training in 
treating nicotine dependence over 9 months (Leone et al., 2015), and in 14 months of recruitment in our 
ongoing organizational intervention trial (R01 CA202699), we have recruited [ADDRESS_1010754]. Schnoll is the Associate 
Director for Population Science at the ACC and regular (weekly) interactions with Larry Shulman, Chief 
of the Cancer Service Line. [CONTACT_739723], along with Drs. Metz and Shuchter (Radiation and Medical 
Oncology chairs) and Drs. Schnoll and Leone (and [CONTACT_739724]), developed the Tobacco Use 
Treatment Service together. The proposed study, which simply adds a new default for an FDA -approved 
treatme nt for smoking, builds off of this collaboration. If the grant is supported, this team will work together 
to implement the proposed study.   
 Recruitment of clinicians will proceed via service -line leadership. Leaders of the Department of 
Medicine’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- based service lines (Teaching Medicine and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739686]) will be briefed on 
the purpose and procedures for the study.  Upon agreeing, a detailed email will be sent to individual 
admitting clinicians within each service line in order to inform them of the intent to alter the alert.  The 
email will conclude with contact [CONTACT_91514], in order to report questions, concerns or 
problems with the proposed workflow.  Recruitment to participation is passive, absent notification to the 
contrary.  
 The same clinician sample will be contact[CONTACT_739701] 
3. This recruitment email will detail the goals of the survey, outline potential compensation, provide ways 
for clinicians to contact [CONTACT_739702], and will note the voluntary and confidential nature of the study.  
 
3.6 Vulnerable Populations  
Population protected under HHS regulations 45CFR46 Subparts B, C, & D Study Procedures:  Children, 
neonates, and prisoners are not included in this research study.  Women who are pregnant at the time of 
baseline assessments will be eligible for the study. 
 
Populations vulnerable to undo influence or coercion:  Educationally or economically disadvantaged 
persons are included but not solely targeted for recruitment. Cognitively impaired persons are not 
included in the current study.  Because of our recruitment efforts for this study, it is possible that University  
of Pennsylvania employees and students may be invited to participate. Status of participation in the study 
will be independent of the subject’s work or school activities.

Version 11: 06- 20-[ADDRESS_1010755]  pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a CDS 
intervention, exposing half of our clinician sample to the TUT Service+VM condition during clinical 
workflow and comparing important outcome measures to those observed among the half exposed to the 
current usual care condition, TUT Service alone. Following the conclusion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], clinicians 
will be surveyed about implementation preferences and barriers influencing effectiveness  of the 
intervention.  
4.2 Study Measures  
Our current usual care CDS “fires” a Best Practice Alert (BPA) for each new inpatient  within the Medical 
Assistant (MA) check- in and vital sign workflow. The BPA requires that MAs assess tobacco use status 
within the past 30 days and satisfy the alert with one of three possible, mutually exclusive answers.  
 
Intervention ordering rate is defined as the number of patients for whom any inpatient tobacco use 
treatment order (for medication, education, and/ or TUTS counseling) was signed divided by [CONTACT_739703]. MAs activate “Order” 
tab for all patients identified as current smokers (within 30 days), resulting in placement of pended order for consult to TUT Service referral within clinical workflow.  
 
Inpatient medication ordering rate  is defined as the number of patients for whom a tobacco use treatment 
medication was ordered in the inpatient setting  divided by [CONTACT_739704]. 
 
Outpatient/discharge medication ordering rate  is defined as the number of patients for whom a tobacco 
use treatment medication was ordered upon patient discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739687].  
 
TUTS referral rate is defined as the number of patients for whom a referral to Penn Medicine’s Smoking 
Cessation Program was placed in the inpatient setting divided by [CONTACT_739705].  
 
 
These measures will be collected only from patients referred to [CONTACT_484489]’s program for treatment:  
  
Quit Line rate , defined as the total number of patients who present for quit line counseling (i.e. telephone 
or electronic), divided by [CONTACT_739706] , defined as the total number of patients who are recommended to 
receive a tobacco use treatment medication by [CONTACT_739707] -up recommendation rate, defined as the total number of patients who are recommended to receive 
a tobacco use treatment medication or a follow -up appointment by [CONTACT_739708] 11 
Version 11: 06- 20-2024  
 Proposed survey measures, including ease and appropriateness, are noted in the attached  survey form  
and will be submitted to the IRB for review prior to survey launch.  
 
5 Study Procedures   
5.1 Usual Care (control condition)  
The TUT Service utilizes the Ask, Advise, and Connect referral framework. (28) This approach utilizes 
CDS logic embedded within the new patient intake routines. Standardized mandatory assessment of 
smoking status for all oncology patients automatically integrating cancer -relevant cessation advice in the 
written After Visit Summary (AVS), and sends an electronic referral to Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialists (CTTS) trained in the unique counseling requirements of patients. (51) Counselors assess the 
patient’s educational, emotional, interpersonal, and skill -based needs, and develop a treatment 
recommendation based on the patient’s priorities. The goal is to direct the patient to ongoing clinical services, either in a face- to-face setting or via telephone/digital quit line support.  
5.2    Novel BE intervention  
Our VM intervention builds upon the established TUT Service process. In addition to connecting the 
patient to TUT Service via electronic referral, it activates a medication management protocol that: 1) 
actively confirms no evidence of renal failure or pregnancy with the  provider, 2) automates a referral to 
prescribing providers within the TUT Service team, prompting a call -back to patient within 24 hours, 3) 
provides written AVS instructions to contact [CONTACT_739709], and 4) pends a varenicline prescription to the medication list, ready for reconciliation by [CONTACT_739710].  The protocol formalizes standard management principles for varenicline, including 
follow- up evaluation, pre -quit period duration, and side effect amelioration.(52)  
5.[ADDRESS_1010756] described as a two- step procedure for 
transferring responsibility for tobacco dependence medication management and follow -up to a 
recognized consulting clinical service.  The steps:  1) Upon executing the order for “Varenicline 
Management Protocol” in the patient’s electronic record, the subject clinician automatically sends an 
electronic alert the Tobacco Use Treatment team, indicating their desire to begin varenicline pharmacotherapy  as part of the patient’s cancer care; 2) A prescribing provider within the tobacco use 
treatment team initiates standard clinical care of the patient within 24 hours of the order, focused on initiating pharmacotherapy of tobacco dependence using current evidence- based guidelines of care.  
As background, recognize that “standard clinical care of the patient” in this context includes:  
i) contact[CONTACT_739711], including history of prior use, insurance coverage, etc.  
ii) ascertain the presence of any potential complications of varenicline use (i.e. current pregnancy, 
uncontrolled seizure disorder) or necessary dose adjustments (i.e. reduced creatinine clearance)  
iii) educate patient regarding proper use and anticipated effects of varenicline, including proper dosing, schedule, possible side effects, and available alternatives.  
iv) providing patient with written information regarding the medication  
v) arrange for an outpatient visit in clinic to follow -up, provide dependence counseling, and make 
medication adjustments as needed. 
 
5.4 Inclusion of Non -cancer Patients  
 
Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 12 
Version 11: 06- 20-[ADDRESS_1010757] TUT Service BPA for all patients, regardless of cancer status. However, in the Novel BE 
intervention, the clinicians would receive the TUTS + VM BPA for their patients with a cancer history but 
would also be exposed to the standard TUT Service BPA for their patients without a cancer history. To 
ensure that these two groups are experiencing the same treatment, we are altering the study logic so 
that the clinicians randomized to the study Novel BE intervention will be exposed to the TUTS + VM BPA 
regardless of a patient’s cancer status.  This will also allow us to test the effect of the intervention on all 
inpatients, on non -cancer in- patients, and on just cancer inpatients. This change simplifies the system 
and expands our ability to test the impact of the intervention on differing in- patient populations.  
 
5.5    Data Collection  
All clinicians and sites use Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457] (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI) to deliver care. Penn Medicine Information Systems (IS) - Colin Wollack,  Penn EPIC Research Team - oversees successful 
integration of TUT Service CDS into ACC workflow. [CONTACT_739666] generates quarterly reports and delivers them electronically to the TUT Service managers ([CONTACT_739725] -CaseyFischer , and Nic oloso). Aim 1 & 2 
data is of high quality; each report is assessed for quality and accuracy through review of the primary 
medical record in a random subset of instances. Aim [ADDRESS_1010758], derived 
from in -person clinical (CTTS) contact, providing multiple opportunities to confirm the accuracy of self -
reported status. Our experience to date suggests that these measures are highly reliable global metrics. 
To protect subject privacy, clinician decision- making and patient health record security is stronger than 
with most other web- based utilities. Numerous layers of data security ensure confidentiality. Data 
Transfer is exclusively via SSL encryption, protecting data transfer between staff.  This is the same technology that is used to protect consumer information (e.g., credit cards) from interception in transit 
over the Internet.  All research data is stored in a secure Oracle database housed behind secure health 
system firewall.   
 
5.6 Administration of Surveys and/or Process  
Clinicians will be invited to complete a survey in the fall of 2023. We anticipate that this survey will take no more than [ADDRESS_1010759] practice alerts from the study, and related cognitive biases. We will keep the 
number of items as low as possible to reduce clinician fatigue and increase response rates.  Please see 
the attached survey form for more detail.  
 
Survey data will be collected through REDCap (a secure, web- based application for collecting and 
managing survey data that can be completed via computer or mobile device). Clinicians from the initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (Aims 1 -2) will be sent a link to the REDCap form via email. If a clinician clicks the link t o learn more 
about participating, they will be routed to a webpage within REDCap that outlines all required consent elements. If they decide to participate, they will click a button which will route them to the fi rst page of the 
survey. Clicking this button indicates their agreement to participate in this aim of the study. See the 
Informed Consent  section for more details regarding this process.

Version 11: 06- 20-[ADDRESS_1010761] needing only 3 months before moving into the next phase. Implementation involves pro gram 
initiation, roll- out of the TUT Service+VM CDS protocol, and preparation of evaluation tools. We expect 
to have the CDS fully operational by [CONTACT_24473] 7. Evaluation  will start within one calendar quarter of 
implementation, and will run for the duration of the project.  
 
 
   
 
[ADDRESS_1010762].  Given that our initial educational intervention was 
able to change absolute engagement rates by [CONTACT_3450] 20%, we assume that a CDS intervention would need to accomplish an equivalent amount of change to be clinically relevant.  There are over 1000 
BPA activations annually, resulting in approximately 600 TUT Service referrals per year (Engagement rate ~ 60%). To detect improvement in Engagement rate to 80%, with 80% power and a significance level 
of p=0.05, we need to enroll 24 clinicians to each arm. Retention:  Because of project nature, we assume 
drop- out will be minimal (<10%) after enrollment; [ADDRESS_1010763] of the intervention on tobacco treatment rates across cancer inpatients, non -cancer 
in-patients, and all in- patients.  
 
7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
Because of the nature of the project, and the minimal risk to participant privacy, we do not plan to constitute a formal Data Safety Monitoring Board.  However, oversight and evaluation will be 
accomplished using standard University procedures for safety monitoring. The specific elements of our oversight plan are as above: 1) all project staff will complete certification in the protection of research 
participants; 2) the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_739688], or more frequently as determined by [CONTACT_1201], which may in turn suspend, terminate 
or restrict the study as appropriate; 3) any serious adverse events will be reviewed in real time by [CONTACT_978]

 and reported to the IRB as required; and 4) the PI [INVESTIGATOR_739689].  
7.2 Internal Monitoring and Auditing  
 
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_739690] (i.e., IRBs, OHR). The following monitoring activities will be conducted according to standard operating procedures. These activities will 
be performed in association with database auditing and facilities monitoring by [CONTACT_739712]/or 
study personnel.  
 
Initial Assessment Monitoring: Penn OHR will conduct a manual review of source documents and Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) for a random subset of participants enrolled in the study. This inspection is the visual comparison of source documents to CRFs in a quantitative assessment of accuracy based on the 
number of data fields. A brief, internal report will be generated to describe findings. If the data are less 
than acceptable, additional cases are requested, with appropriate counseling/training for staf f. 
 
Protocol Monitoring: Protocol monitoring includes a survey of those activities that are associated with 
protocol adherence such as study visit deviation and violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. A specific 
protocol monitoring plan will be used. All accrued cases will be subjected to protocol monitoring 
throughout the duration of the trial.  
 
Database Auditing: [CONTACT_329072] and the RA will review data entered into the database versus that recorded 
on the CRFs. All accrued cases will be subjected to database auditing throughout the trial. Depending on the data management findings, re- training will be provided, should problems such as increased errors 
be detected.  
 
Data Auditing: [CONTACT_329072] and the RA will review safety data recorded on the CRF versus that contained 
on the actual source document (patient chart, EHR). All accrued cases will be subjected to auditing throughout the duration of the trial. A Regulatory Binder Review by [CONTACT_739713]: IRB Protocol, Amendment Approvals, IRB Closure Letter, List of Authorized 
Signatures, Laboratory Certifications, Protocol and Amendment Signature [CONTACT_68615], Financial Disclosure Questionnaires, and Monitoring Log. Additional monitoring by [CONTACT_739714]: source documentation 
verification; adverse event documentation; and facility assessment.  
 
Data Security: Using network firewall technologies, the database will prevent the three major sources of 
data security problems: unauthorized internal access to data, external access to data, and malicious intent to destroy data and systems. Controlled user access will  ensure that only appropriate and 
authorized personnel are able to view, access, and modify trial data. All modifications to data will document user access and data associated with the modification, as well as values prior to modification.  
 
IRB Monitoring : The protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_739715]. Annual reporting and auditing will be conducted by [CONTACT_1201]. All 
procedures will be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. A protocol -specific Data Safety Monitoring Board will not be 
used for this study since it is not a clinical trial. The Penn IRB will ensure participant safety and data integrity.  
 
Evidence of Training in Human Subject Research: All personnel working on this project will be required 
to review the protocol, complete training in the protection of human subjects (developed and implemented by [CONTACT_372482]), and undergo training.  
Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 15 
Version 11: 06- 20-[ADDRESS_1010764]’s  study  
identification  number  (unique for clinicians ). A linked subject identification table is created for the storing 
of subject name, address  and telephone contact [CONTACT_3031]. This table uses the automatically generated 
index number rather than the study identification number. The master subject map and subject identification information tables are maintained in a separate database. Using this  method, no identifying 
subject information is directly linked to medical information or other study data. For our multi -site trials, 
we have long- established protocols to guard against improper use of hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_156837] (e.g., locked 
files, numeric coding procedures). The present research team has not experienced the unauthorized use of study data. A web -based data collection procedure will minimize the possibility of loss of privacy or 
confidentiality.  
 
How will confidentiality of data be maintained?  Check all that apply.  
 
 Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved in 
the study.  
 Computer -based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the use of 
access privileges and passwords.  
 Prior to access to any study -related information, personnel will be required to sign statements agreeing 
to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.  
 Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information.  
 A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at risk of 
criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject’s financial standing, employability, or liability.  
 A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the subject 
and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of confidentiality.  (This is 
not an option for FDA -regulated research.)  
 Precautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because the 
research involves web- based surveys.   
 Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible identification 
of subjects.  
 Other (specify):     
To protect participant confidentiality, only the research team outlined in HSERA will have access to review identified research records. Confidentiality will be protected to the fullest extent allowable under the law.  
 If any data needs to be transmitted, it will be done through a Penn- approved secure encrypted file transfer solution 
as is described Penn IRB’s Guidance on Electronic Data Protection Requirements for Research Involving the Use of PHI. Records will not be released without the participant’s consent unless required by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., imminent risk of harm to self suspected) or court order. When results of the research are presented at scientific meetings or published, no identifying information will be included.  
 All identifiable data, including the master list linking identifiers to the ID number and recordings, will be destroyed in 2028, seven years after the award period ends.  
 
 
Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 16 
Version 11: 06- 20-2024  
 The following personal health information will be collected as part of this study:  
1. Name  
2. Address  
3. Date of Birth  
4. Phone number(s)  
5. Electronic mail address  
6. Cancer History  
7. Medical Record Number  
8. Tobacco Use History  
 
For patient data collected from electronic medical records, as soon as patient data is received by [CONTACT_5984], all identifiers will be destroyed and replaced with an identification number unique for patients.  
Using this method, no identifying subject information is directly linked to medical information or other study data.  
8.2 Sources of Research Material  
All data collected for this study will be used solely for the purpose of the present study and will be treated 
with full confidentiality.  The only information collected to be used for research purposes will be from the 
qualitative interview concerning attitudes about the implementation of the TUTS program.   
 
The integrity and security of the data will be maintained as described  below  
8.3 Computers and Databases 
Personnel at Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA)  have personal 
computers linked to a common computer server. The CIRNA maintains a LAN to allow for remote access to common software and computer files. This LAN maintains all necessary communications, word-processing, and data management systems (DMS). Data (for all studies, including the one proposed 
here) are maintained on password -protected computers and are maintained on a DMS overseen by 
[CONTACT_739716]. The DMS uses ORACLE and MS ACCESS to permit real -time data entry, storage, and QA 
by [CONTACT_169993]- based access and scannable forms, which increases standardization. We have >15 years of 
experience with this DMS for similar trials. The DMS constructs semantic constraints on fields, and is 
used for data entry, storage, retrieval, and security. The DMS mimics the appearance of CRFs completed 
at visits. Each visit date is “mile-stoned” (e.g., completed, scheduled, missed). During data entry, validation 
occurs via built -in mechanisms (e.g., Range Checks - data range restricted). Daily backups occur to 
protect against corruption or deletion. Protection of privacy is ensured by: [CONTACT_739717], use of ID numbers vs. names, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_111471], and restricting access to the dataset linking names with ID numbers. Currently, this DMS is used for several mult i-site smoking 
cessation clinical trials (e.g., R01 DA025078; R01 CA165001). This web- based DMS allows for the 
simultaneous running of the trial at multiple sites using standardized systems. The same system will be 
used for the proposed study.  All information from the study (i.e., transcripts of interviews) and the results 
of the qualitative analyses will be stored within this DMS.  
[ADDRESS_1010765] privacy/confidentiality.   
 
Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 17 
Version 11: 06- 20-2024  
 Threats to Privacy/Confidentiality : Since information provided by [CONTACT_739718], it is possible that subject privacy or confidentiality can be threatened. To address 
this concern, the Data Management System has set up several safeguards to prevent unauthorized 
access to study data. An automatically generated index number is assigned to a subject’s study 
identification number (unique for clinicians ). A linked subject identification table is created for the storing 
of subject name, address and telephone contact [CONTACT_3031]. This table uses the automatically 
generated index number rather than the study identification number. The master subject map and 
subject identification information tables are maintained in a separate database. Using this method, no 
identifying subject information is directly linked to medical information or other study data. For our trials, 
we have long- established protocols to guard against improper use of hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_156837] (e.g., locked 
files, numeric coding procedures). The present research team has not experienced the unauthorized 
use of study data. A server -based data collection procedure will minimize the possibility of loss of privacy 
or confidentiality.  
 
Protection Against  Risks . The following  methods  will be employed to minimize  participant  risk. 
 
To protect subject privacy, clinician decision- making and patient health record security is stronger than 
with most other web- based utilities.  Numerous layers of data security ensure confidentiality.  Data 
Transfer is exclusively via SSL encryption, protecting data transfer between staff.  This is the same 
technology that is used to protect consumer information (e.g., credit cards) from interception in transit 
over the Internet.  All research data is stored in a secure Oracle database housed behind secure health 
system firewall.   
 
In accordance with NIH and IRB guidelines, this protocol will employ the following mechanisms for adverse event reporting: 1) alert the IRB of any and all reports of serious adverse events; 2) informing 
all members of the study team of any and all reports of serious adverse events; and 3) notification to NIH of any actions taken by [CONTACT_739719].  
9.[ADDRESS_1010766] has the potential to reduce 
treatment burdens for clinicians, improve clinicians skill with tobacco treatment techniques and 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], improve cancer treatment outcomes, and reduce morbidity from treatment related complications.  
9.3 Compensation  
 
Aim 3 surveys: Participating clinicians will have the opportunity to receive a $[ADDRESS_1010767] to reduce cancer morbidity and 
Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 18 
Version 11: 06- 20-[ADDRESS_1010768] done previously (IRB 
844846). When potential participants click the link to participate, they will be directed to a page within REDCap that outlines the required elements of informed consent. If they agree to participate, participants will indicate consent by [CONTACT_17325] “next”  button which will take them to the electronic survey. If they do 
not want to participate, they will simply close the window.  
 
All potential participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and they will be provided with the 
information that they need to make an informed choice. We will provide contact [CONTACT_739720], during, or after completing the survey.  
 
10.2 Waiver of Informed Consent:  
 
We are requesting a waiver of informed consent and HIPAA authorization from clinicians and patients (see attached request for waiver of HIPAA authorization). A waiver of informed consent is requested for 
the following reasons.  First, it is not feasible to consent every patient and clinician and as mentioned this 
initiative would occur with or without the study of it.  Second, if members of the control (Usual Care) group 
were consented, they would know they were being studied and this could change their behavior.  This 
could potentially disrupt the design of the study and make interpretation of the findings challenging.  Third, 
clinicians are not being forced to prescribe smoking cessation treatments for their patients.  Instead, they 
are being reminded of evidence- based guidelines and offered an opportunity to review pertinent 
information and decide to refer to appropriate treatment or not.  This is no different than standard of care in which a clinician would review the same information and decide to prescribe.  The initiative is simply a 
reminder for the clinician and makes their standard of care process easier to conduct.   
 
For Aim 3, we are requesting a waiver of written  documentation of consent from the Penn IRB. Surveys 
will be completed via REDCap. During these instances, we will not have an opportunity to collect a signed copy of the consent form. This research activity presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects 
and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.  
 
[ADDRESS_1010769] documented factors associated with continued smoking 
(56,57)  and barriers to treatment engagement (58, 59). They have developed and evaluated behavioral 
counseling interventions specific to cancer patient barriers, including low motivation, depression, and fatalism (61), evaluated pharmacologic cessation interventions (40,62,63) , and documented the 
Improving Tobacco Treatment Rates for Cancer Patients Who Smoke   Page 19 
Version 11: 06- 20-2024  
 feasibility of extending tobacco cessation treatment to patient family members who smoke. (23) This 
experience, along with [CONTACT_111606]’s  leadership position at the cancer center and [CONTACT_484489]’s expertise 
with system -based tobacco treatment interventions (10,31,33)  will help ensure the success of the project.

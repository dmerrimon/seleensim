Item [ADDRESS_351541] / Project Summary   
 Provide a succinct and accurate description of the proposed 
research. State the purpose/aims. Describe concisely the research 
design and methods for achieving the stated goals. This section 
should be understandable to all members of the IRB, scientific and 
non-scientific.   
DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACE PROVIDED . 
Purpose/Objectives: The purpose of the current proposal is to test the hypothesis whether daily oral MB for two week period (and up 
to [ADDRESS_351542] decides to continue participation) will improve memory, attention, cognition and functional connectivi ty in 
healthy aging volunteers, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects by [CONTACT_288520].    
Research Design/Plan: Adult volunteers will be studied using a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled design.  MB and 
Placebo arms will be included for healthy aging, MCI and AD groups.  MB and placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_288509].  Each arm will also receive a pi[INVESTIGATOR_288510] (phenazopyridine hydrochloride) with each daily dose as urinary t ract 
analgesic and to maintain coloration of the urine in both groups. Subjects will have MRI scanning on two different days, four teen 
days apart. After v isit #[ADDRESS_351543] will be given the option to continue the study for another 10 weeks.  
Methods: This study will use a low -dose oral USP MB (282mg) daily over a two -week period and subjects will take drug daily for two 
weeks combined with an additional daily dose of 97.5mg of Azo.   Subjects will take 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_288511]/placebo each day (1 with ea ch meal 
(94mg of MB per pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) and 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_288512] 14 days.  
Daily dose intake may be extended to 12 weeks after the initial follow up visit.  
Clinical Relevance: Middle -aged and elderly people with MCI are at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_6237]’s disease, a condition that 
slowly destroys memory and thinking skills.  Approximately 5.[ADDRESS_351544] experimental

USP methylene blue (MB) is a FDA -grandfathered drug safely used to treat 
methemoglobinemia, carbon dioxide and cyanide poisoning in humans2. Daily 4 mg/kg oral MB has been 
used safely for one year in clinical trials . Oral MB readily enters the brain and has unique energy -
enhancing and antioxidant properties and acts in the mitochondria to sustain or enhance ATP energy 
production, thereby [CONTACT_288521] 3. MB has recently 
been shown to reduce behavioral impairments in animal models of Parkinson's disease 4 and Alzheimer’s 
disease 5 6. Our laboratory has  shown with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that low -dose MB 
(intravenous 1 mg/kg) increases glucose uptake, oxygen consumption, blood flow [ADDRESS_351546] step to translate these experimental findings to humans, we are carrying out a 
15-410H, Fox, Form BC, 11 -06-15, AMD.docx  
vSept3 -2014  3 randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, phase II clinical trial ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to evaluate the 
effects of oral USP MB (280 mg) on memory and cognition by [CONTACT_288522] (CBF), evoked 
functional MRI (fMRI) and resting- state functional connectivity fMRI (fcMRI) on young (30 yo) healthy 
volunteers. Our findings suggest the MB has favorable cognitive and memory effects. The subjects, 28 
subjects to date, did not experience any negative adverse event.  
There are also a few MB clinical trials in mild to moderate AD and dementia ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). An abstract of a phase II clinical trial reported that daily oral doses of 300 
mg non -reduced form of MB (methylthioninium chloride), under trade name “Rember” (TauRx 
Therapeutics, Inc.), slowed the progression of AD compared to placebo 13. Ongoing phase III clinical trials 
use a proprietary reduced form of methylene blue (leukomethylene blue, LMTXTM, TauRx) in mild and 
moderate AD and variant frontotemporal dementia. Our clinical trial differs from these clinical trials in 
several aspects:  (1) TauRx phase II and phase III trials enrolled subjects with mild to severe Alzheimer’s 
disease and frontotemporal dementia (no MCI). Our study will be the first phase II clinical trial using MB in MCI, where early intervention is likely more effective. (2) TauRx phase II clinical trial used a large 
number of subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia and a larger dose up to 300 mg daily for 
one year with Rember
TM (non -reduced form of MB). Our phase II trial will offer a markedly lower sample 
size, lower dose, and shorter duration, enabled by [CONTACT_288523]. (3) The TauRx phase III clinical trial uses LMTX
TM, a new reduced form of MB that is less well studied. Our phase II trial 
will use the non -proprietary non- reduced form of MB (methylthioninium chloride), which has been used 
in most preclinical studies and clinical trials. (4)  Subjects will be recruited from among well -characterized 
participants and a large cohort in the [LOCATION_007] Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC) . These 
subjects all have longitudinal psychometrics, and serum protein biomarkers on file, and frozen serum samples and DNA stored for future analyses. (4) The TauRx trials target to inhibit tau aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles of AD and demented patients, whereas we target to support healthy cognitive function by i ncreasing mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism and reducing oxidative stress in aging 
individuals before onset of AD neuropathology and dementia.  
Our proposed phase II trial is very similar to our current phase II trial ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) except it 
now includes middle aged, MCI and Alzheimer’s disease subjects and daily MB dose for 2 to 12 weeks (as 
opposed to healthy subjects and single dose) as well as additional neuropsychological tests.

Research Plan / Description of the Research Methods  a.  Provide a comprehensive narrative  describing the research methods .   
Provide the plan for data analysis  (include as applicable the sample size calculation).  
 Step-by-Step Methods:   
Adult volunteers will be studied using a randomized, double- blinded, placebo- controlled 
design. Placebo arms will be included for healthy middle aged, healthy elderly, MCI and AD groups as 
controls. USP Methylene blue (MB) and placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_288513]. The subject will take 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_288514] (94mg per pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) three times a day with each 
meal. Placebo will be FD&C Blue # 2 which is a powder similar to the powder form of methylene blue. 
Each arm will also receive a pi[INVESTIGATOR_288515] (97.[ADDRESS_351553]) with each daily dosage. Phenazopyridine is a safe OTC product used for urinary discomfort 
that turns urine brownish. This drug will be given to both MB and placebo groups so that both show 
similar urine discoloration. This choice of administration is justified not only to maintain the blind 
procedure but because it would prevent any mild discomfort experienced by [CONTACT_288525]. The subject, person administering the drug, and data analysts will not know whether the intervention is pla
cebo or MB. The design will only be unblinded at the last steps when 
necessary. All subjects will be told that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_288516]/feces 
discoloration depending on individual’s metabolism.  
 
Step by [CONTACT_185756]:  
The healthy elderly, MCI and AD subjects will be recruited from the [LOCATION_007] Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC). A neuropsychological battery of tests (eg. logical memory I, logical 
memory II, verbal fluency/COWA, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Global Depressive 
Scale (GDS), etc.) will be administered for all subjects before MRI study ( 2 month window).  
 Baseline MRI scan will be performed during visit 1.  
 
Subject will be given labeled pi[INVESTIGATOR_288517] [ADDRESS_351554] will be 
contact[CONTACT_288526] 3, 7 and 11 ( ± 2 days) to document any adverse event or problem. 
After 2 weeks ± 3 days of MB (282 mg, oral x 14 days) or placebo, another neuropsychological tests 
and MRI scan will be obtained. On visit 2, the subject will be given the option to continue for another 
10 weeks. During visit 3, after 10 weeks ± [ADDRESS_351555] will complete the  subset of 
neuropsychological tests completed in visit 1, and some of the MRI scans completed in visit 1.  
 
For MRI, task -evoked BOLD fMRI, cerebral blood flow (CBF), resting- state fMRI, and CBF will be 
performed. For the task -evoked BOLD fMRI, subjects will perform the following scans while in the

Delayed match -to-sample memory task: The DMS task measures reaction time in terms of 
memory retrieval latency. The subject views a 6x6 pattern for [ADDRESS_351556] answers are recorded. This exercise is repeated with 22 random patterns for 
approximately 10 mins18 19. 
 
Face- Name [CONTACT_288530]: The subject is shown blocks of stimuli where a novel or familiar face is 
paired with a name. In a later run, the subjects are asked whether the correct name [CONTACT_288531]. The correct and incorrect answers are recorded.  The acquisition of data 
is divided into encoding and recognition tasks. This exercise is repeated many times lasting 
about 10 minutes 20 21. 
 
Psychomotor vigilance task: The PVT measures attention and time -on-task effects22. The 
subject receives a visual cue that alerts them to press a button as fast as possible. The 
reaction time is recorded. A rest period follows for 4- [ADDRESS_351557] behavioral data (ie. Correct responses, reaction time) will be recorded simultaneously while 
the MRI data is acquired by a computer.  
 
For CBF, the subject is instructed to close his or her eyes and relax in the scanner without falling 
asleep for 5- [ADDRESS_351558] is told to close eyes and not to think about a particular topic, lasting 
about 10 minutes.  
 
In addition, CBF will be measured during inhalation of medical -grade 5% CO2 in air for [ADDRESS_351559] anatomical MRI will also be acquired for co -registration. 
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (5 -7minutes) will also be acquired at one of the three visits.

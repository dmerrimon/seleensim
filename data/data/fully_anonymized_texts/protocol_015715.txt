1. Abstract 
a. Provide no more than a one page r esearch abstract briefly stati ng the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importa nce of the research. 
 
We have been studying the neural and behavioral correlates of l anguage and other cognitive 
functions longitudinally in pati ents with stroke from the acute  stage to approximately one year 
after stroke.  fMRI and MRI scans in conjunction with behavioral data have allowed us to gain 
insight on some of the neural dynamics of recovery and factors that may impact or predict that 
recovery.  We have identified im portant deficits in social cogn itive function in individuals with 
right hemisphere stroke, including impaired recognition of emot ion from tone of voice and 
facial recognition, and loss of empathy.  We have identified ve ry similar impairments in 
individuals with frontotemporal dementia.  While we are current ly testing transcranial direct-
current stimulation with language therapy as a method for treat ing language deficits in patients 
with left hemisphere stroke, we have not previously attempted to treat social cognitive deficits following right hemisphere stroke and frontotemporal dementia ( FTD).  We now aim to use an 
web-based social-cognitive training program developed by [CONTACT_149140]. to treat empathic 
deficits in patients whose social-emotional functioning has been affected by [CONTACT_84639].   
The proposed study utilizes the PI’s experience in speech-langu age pathology and cognitive 
neuropsychology, clinical trainin g in neurology, and expertise in dementia to test the 
effectiveness of web-based soc ial-cognitive training organizati ons in FTD and right hemisphere 
stroke.  The investigation will focus on characterizing each in dividual patient’s deficits and 
determining whether cognitive training improves their performan ce on social-cognitive tasks.  
The training follows a drill-and-practice bottom-up model that uses principles of 
neuroplasticity to build and stre ngthen empathic skills such as  prosody identification and facial 
expression recognition.  The design is a cross-over trial, with  randomized order of conditions; 
each participant will serve as their own control.  Every partic ipant will engage in both a social-
cognitive training condition and a non-specific control trainin g condition in a random order.  
They will be assessed at baseline, after completing one conditi on, and after completing the 
second condition.  We hope to identify specific social cognitio n domains that are influenced by 
[CONTACT_149141] (e.g. base d on lesion location or severity of 
disease progression) who can benefit from these exercises.   
The importance of the results is to provide a potentially effec tive and low cost treatment for 
social-emotional impairments in patients with FTD and stroke.  Currently there are almost no 
interventions available for th ese symptoms in these populations , and if this treatment proves to 
be effective, it could have major clinical implications for the  prognosis and functional outcome

 o f  p a t i e n t s  w i t h  s t r o k e  o r  F T D .   T h e  s c i e n t i f i c  i m p a c t  o f  t h e s e  results could provide greater 
understanding of the brain’s ability to reorganize and repair d amaged empathic networks in the 
context of training.  This mode of training has not been attemp ted in FTD previously and 
previous studies of training plat forms have primarily focused o n language or non-social deficits 
in stroke.  This study will be one of the first in this domain and will elucidate the nature and 
malleability of the social-emotional impairments in stroke and FTD.   
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives) 
 
1. Test the hypothesis that patient s with right hemisphere stroke and frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD) show more improvement on u ntrained tests of social cognit ion after web-based social-
cognitive training exercises (Posit Science Inc.) than after no n-specific cognitive training. 
2. Evaluate patients with FTD and stroke in multiple domains of social cognition (such as 
emotional contagion, affective  perspective-taking, and affective prosody identification) as well 
as mood, attention, and working memory, before and after interv ention to identify which 
functions improve after training. 
3. Assess the feasibility and acceptability of web-based intervent ions in patients with stroke or 
FTD through examination of usage  data and patient feedback.   
4. Determine the effects of lo cation of lesion or focal atrophy on  improvements in social-cognitive 
training exercises w ith intervention. 
 
3. Background (briefly describe pre-clinical and clinica l data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other rele vant information to justify t he research) 
Problem: Both patients with str oke or FTD can experience impair ments in social-emotional 
functioning.  While the profile of deficits may differ in these  two illnesses, there are convergent 
issues in empathic abilities es pecially in right hemisphere str oke and behavioral variant FTD.  
Deficits or deterioration in e mpathy can impact patients’ inter personal relationships and adversely 
impact patients’ quality of life.  However, there are currently  very few treatments that specifically 
target these issues, and many of t hem are limited in their scop e and effectiveness.  Recently, web-
based training interventions ha ve shown efficacy in treating fu nctional impairments in stroke and 
social deficits in other disorder s such as schizophrenia.  It i s crucial to test whether this cost-
effective and mobile interve ntion can be eff ectively utilized to treat social-emotional deficits in 
patients with stroke or FTD.   
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study proced ures   
(distinguish research procedures f rom those that are part of ro utine care). 
 Based on medical chart review, a ll patients will first be scre ened for eligibility.  Patients will 
only be enrolled in the study if they meet both inclusion and e xclusion criteria.  The study will 
be explained to the patient and informed consent will be obtain ed before they undergo baseline 
social and cognitive assessments and receive a laptop to begin either a social-cognitive or 
control training condition (random ly determined by [CONTACT_149142] e of 30 sealed envelopes).  
Following the completion of the 20-30 hours of training over th e course of 4 weeks, the patient 
will be assessed with the same measurements again.  The patient  will then complete the second 
training condition (20-30 hours over 4 weeks) that they were no t randomly assigned to initially.  
The patient will then receive a final assessment, return the la ptop, and receive compensation for 
the study.   
 Each of the three assessments will include the following tests: 1) Star Cancellation test, an assessment of spatial attenti on (Friedman, 1992);  2) Interperso nal Reactivity Index (IRI), a 
subjective evaluation of 4 compone nts of empathy, rated by [CONTACT_18629] (Davis, 1983); 3) 
Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), an objective evaluati on of empathy (Baron-Cohen

 et al., 2001); 4) Social Cognitive Tasks from the University of  Pennsylvania Computerized 
Neurocognitive Battery (Penn CNB ), a measure of affect percepti on and facial memory (Gur et 
al., 2010); 5) Prosody Battery, a w ell-validated test of expres sion and production of prosody 
(Ross and Monnot, 2008; Ross et a l., 1997); 6) Forward and Back ward Digit Span, a brief 
assessment of attention and worki ng memory; 7) Faux Pas Test, a  test of social awareness 
(Gregory et al., 2002); and 8) the P atient Health Questionnaire-9, a well-validated screening tool 
for depression (Kroenke et al., 2001 ). The IRI must be complete d by a caregiver or spouse.   
b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants. 
The study duration is around [ADDRESS_171623]-treatment (1st condition), and 2nd post-treatment (2nd condition) 
assessments.  If there are techni cal issues with the laptop or online portal, assistance will be 
provided remotely if possible.   
c. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable. 
Double-blinding is not possible in this study due to the large difference in the training 
content between the two training conditions.   
d. Justification of why pa rticipants will not receive routine care or will have current therapy 
stopped.   
Participants will receive their routine care, medications, or t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_149139].  Cognitive rehabilitation for chronic right hemisphere s troke and behavioral variant FTD 
is very rare, so we anticipate most patients will be receiving no specific therapy for the deficits 
being targeted.  
e. Justification for inclusio n of a placebo or non-treatment group . 
There is no placebo or non-treatment group in this study.  Ther e is a control condition (non-
specific cognitive exercises) that we expect may improve genera l attention, but we do not 
expect such training to affect social cognition. 
f. Definition of treatment failure or  participant re moval criteria . 
N/A. 
g. Description of what happens to pa rticipants receiving therapy w hen study ends or if a 
participant’s participation i n the study ends prematurely. 
Participating in this current study is independent of their routing medical care.  Therefore, if 
they prematurely end participati on in the study or complete the  study, patients will still continue 
their standard care.

drugs to be used. 
b. Justification and safety infor mation if FDA approved drugs will  be administered for non-FDA 
approved indications or if doses  or routes of administration or participant populations are

7. Study Statistics 
a. Primary outcome variable.   
Change in performance from baseline to 1st post treatment on Penn CNB tasks (Total) vs. 1st 
post-treatment (new baseline) to 2nd post-treatment on Pe nn CNB tasks (total). 
b. Secondary outcome variables.   Changes in total and subtest sc ores on IRI, Prosody Battery, RMET, Faux Pas Test, and star 
cancellation.   
c. Statistical plan including sampl e size justification and interim data analysis.   
We will compare the change in means of outcome measures after s ocial cognition treatment 
vs. control treatment. The primar y outcome variable will be cha nge in performance on the Penn 
CNB tasks after the end of eac h treatment. The null hypothesis is H
0: µ1= µ 2, where m [ADDRESS_171624] little change  in the Penn CNB with the control 
(non-specific cognitive exercises) in chronic right hemisphere stroke (as we see decline rather 
than recovery in chronic stroke in these functions), and little  change or decline in patients with 
behavioral variant FTD.  But we will evaluate the effect of con dition versus sequence 
independently. The primary analyses will evaluate the change in performance on Penn CNB as the dependent variable, Y
ij = µ + S i + µ (j) +C (j)  + e ij where i represents a subjects, j represents 
the sequence (1 or 2). The Y ij is the change in the evaluations. The S ik represents the random 
effect of the subjects. The µ (j) represents the means of the two treatments (social cognition o r 
control). The C (j) represents the carryover effects. The test for the treatment ef f e c t  c a n  b e  
obtained from this model. First ly, the effect of carryover effects will be tested at p<0.1. If this is 
significant, then only the first sequence data will be analyzed  as this sequence is free of 
carryover effects. A similar analysis will be done for the chan ge in accuracy of secondary 
outcome variables.   Power.  We expect to enroll up to [ADDRESS_171625]  20-30 participants will 
complete the study.  Because of the social cognitive deficits i n these patients (accompanied by 
[CONTACT_149143]), there is likely to be h igh attrition.  If the sample size in 
each treatment group is 13, (a tota l sample size of 26) a cross over design will have 86% power 
to detect a difference in means of  6 (the difference between t reatment mean change in accuracy, 
m
1, of 10 and a control mea n change in accuracy, m 2, of 4) using a two group t -test with a two-
sided alpha of 0.05.   
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].   Patients will be allowed to stop at any time, but they will not  receive compensation if they fail to 
complete all criteria for compensation.  Their data will only b e used for Aim 1 if they complete 
the entire study.  We may be able to use data from participants who complete the social-
cognition treatment conditi on only for Aims 2 and 3.

results will be made availabl e.  If we identify any problems in  thinking skills, the patient will be 
given the option of referral to reh abilitation specialists afte r the treatment study.  If we identify

will be assigned codes for data c ollection and analysis. Data w ill be kept in locked file cabinets 
or secure computers that are pa ssword protected.  When the study is over and the results are 
public, no information linked to the  patient will be included.  We will not collect sensitive 
information.   
e. Financial risks to t he participants.   
All costs of study procedure and training modules will be provi ded to the patient for free at no 
cost to the patient or his /her insurance company. 
 
9. Benefits 
a. Description of the probable bene fits for the participant and fo r society. 
 
b. Individual participant.  The study might improve a participant’ s cognitive and social-
emotional functioning if the training is effective.  The partic ipant will also receive a small 
financial compensation if they c omplete the study (see below).  
c. Society.  The results of this wo rk may provide a novel treatm
ent option in right hemisphere 
stroke and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and allow  for future development of 
further interventions that target social-emotional deficits in right hemisphere stroke and 
behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.  Identifying a cost -effective treatment 
intervention will also contribut e to the overall care of stroke patients.   
 
10. Payment and Remuneration a. Detail compensation for particip ants including possible total c ompensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the  protocol. 
     If the patient satisfactorily  completes the following requ irements, he or she will receive $[ADDRESS_171628]  complete both training modules and all three assessment sessions.  
Second, this compensation is cont ingent on the return of the la ptop to the lab in working condition 
without severe damage.  If the pa tient does not return the lapt op in reasonable working condition, 
the patient will not receive co mpensation for participation in the study.

      If the patient completes both training modules within 9 we eks, they will receive a $25 bonus 
following their final assessment and return of the laptop.   
 
11. Costs 
a. Detail costs of study procedure(s)  or drug (s) or substance(s) to participants and identify 
who will pay for them. 
 Each laptop will cost between $250 to $300, and each participant’s compensation will be between $100.00 to $125.00, which will all be paid for by [CONTACT_149144]’s Woodrow Wilson Research Fellowship fund. There will be no cost to the patient or to the patient’s insurance.

 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND 
 
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects the skin, joints and nails. The 
condition affects as many as 7 million people in the [LOCATION_002], approximately 50% 
of whom are estimated to have nail involvement.[1, 2] The effects of psoriasis on the 
nail are often overlooked in light of cutaneous manifestations. However, the lifetime 
incidence of nail involvement is 80-90% among patients with cutaneous psoriasis.[2] In 
some cases, nail psoriasis is the only manifestation of the disease.[3] Nail psoriasis can 
also be a marker of psoriatic arthritis, which coexists in 80% of cases and can have 
debilitating consequences.[2] 
 
Nail psoriasis results in pi[INVESTIGATOR_758400], separation of the nail from the nail bed, 
thickening of the skin under the nail, nail discoloration and other abnormalities.[2] Left 
untreated, nail psoriasis progresses and can result in social stigma, pain, and loss of 
manual dexterity, which may affect typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], computer work, and many other activities 
requiring the use of hands. The disorder is diagnosed clinically through physical 
examination of the nails. A supporting history of cutaneous psoriasis is helpful, though 
not necessary, in making the diagnosis. Tissue sampling and histological examination 
can also support the diagnosis, and x-rays of the hand may be used to check for the 
presence of psoriatic arthritis, which commonly coexists with nail psoriasis.[2, 4]  
 Current treatments for nail psoriasis include topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], systemic medications, 
intralesionals, and biologics. The treatment of nail psoriasis is challenging because few 
guidelines exist; treatment regimens are clinician-dependent and are tailored to the 
patient’s needs.[5] Topi[INVESTIGATOR_758401]. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_758402] “first-line” therapy. The advantages of topi[INVESTIGATOR_758403] (when not used for prolonged 
periods).[5] Other topi[INVESTIGATOR_758404] D analogs, retinoids, fluorouracil, 
anthralin and tacrolimus are also used. Though many of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_758405], as topi[INVESTIGATOR_758406].[5] The major limitation of all topi[INVESTIGATOR_758407] 
[ADDRESS_1038482] commonly triamcinolone acetonide (ITA), are often 
used in the treatment of nail psoriasis. TA is a corticosteroid that is FDA approved for 
the treatment of psoriasis via intralesional injection. Corticosteroids are used in the 
treatment of many inflammatory dermatologic diseases. Briefly, they work by [CONTACT_758425]’s inflammatory response. At higher doses, the response is more inhibited.  
 
ITA is used in concentrations ranging from 2.5mg/mL - 10mg/mL in the treatment of nail 
psoriasis.[1, 3] There is debate in the literature regarding the ideal concentration of ITA 
to treat nail psoriasis.[1] That is, the dose that gives the best efficacy while limiting side 
effects. No randomized prospective studies investigating this question exist. A number 
of authors have conducted studies on the efficacy of ITA in the treatment of nail 
psoriasis using specific concentrations of ITA (most commonly 5mg/mL or 10mg/mL). 
[6-10] To our knowledge, no authors have directly compared the concentrations to one 
another. Determining the lowest effective concentration of ITA is important because 
patients receiving higher than necessary concentrations may experience an increase in 
side effects. The side effects of corticosteroids such as TA are numerous, and include 
thinning of the skin at the site of injection, thinning along the lymphatic vessels draining 
the injection site, allergic reactions, infection, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_758408].[11] 
 
[ADDRESS_1038483] demonstrated the efficacy of ITA, at different concentrations 
ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/mL at 0.1-0.2mL volumes.[6-8, 12] In these studies, nail 
psoriasis has been shown to significantly clinically improve with the treatment. The 
studies cited occurred mostly before the year 2000. In no studies to our knowledge were 
the concentrations compared directly. In 2000, the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NaPSI) 
was developed. The NaPSI is a nail psoriasis assessment tool developed by [CONTACT_758426], [CONTACT_758435]. This tool, detailed in Appendix 
A, allows researchers and clinicians to objectively quantify changes in psoriatic nails 
following treatments and study interventions.[13] Prior to 2000, authors used different 
methods to assess change following the study intervention, but most of these were 
qualitative. For example, Peachey et al. used a qualitative assessment (i.e. no 
improvement versus slight improvement versus marked improvement.) De Berker also 
used a qualitative assessment, but graded each feature of nail psoriasis (i.e. ridging, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940], etc.) separately. The most recent study cited by [CONTACT_758427]-Battista et al., did use the 
NaPSI score. This score is increasingly widely used in studies of nail psoriasis. 
 
The frequency and length of time that injections were administered in the cited studies 
varied between studies, but in most occurred at monthly intervals for 4-[ADDRESS_1038484], 
toenail psoriasis is less common compared to fingernail psoriasis.[2] Second, in our 
clinical experience, patients are more motivated to treat fingernails, due to their 
important functions in daily activities, and for cosmetics. Thus, the treatment of 
fingernail psoriasis with ITA is most clinically relevant. 
[ADDRESS_1038485] two fingernails involved. This will allow us 
to use placebo in one fingernail of every participant, thus establishing the efficacy of ITA 
in our study by [CONTACT_758428]. In addition to efficacy 
assessments, we will measure changes in quality of life due to the study intervention as 
an outcome. Quality of life assessments will be done with the NPQ10 assessment, which 
is a validated assessment tool developed to measure quality of life in nail psoriasis.[14] 
This tool is included in Appendix B. 
 
All fingernails not treated with placebo will undergo randomization to four groups 
corresponding to four concentrations of ITA under investigation (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 
mg/mL). Thus, a participant with five affected fingernails may have a different 
concentration of ITA used as the study intervention in each fingernail. This approach 
has been used in studies of ITA in other dermatologic diseases such as alopecia areata. 
[15] In the cited study, the lesions of subjects with alopecia areata were divided into four 
quadrants, corresponding to four concentrations of ITA that were injected. We believe 
this approach will be helpful in comparing the efficacy of different concentrations in the 
same patient. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE 
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory condition that affects millions of people in the [LOCATION_002]. Approximately 50% of patients with cutaneous psoriasis have nail involvement; 
nail psoriasis causes significant pain, and can lead to loss of manual dexterity, therefore 
impairing the ability to use the hands or perform work. Intralesional triamcinolone 
acetonide is considered one of the mainstays of treatment for nail psoriasis. By 
[CONTACT_758429], we can 
minimize side effects for millions of people affected with nail psoriasis worldwide. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
 The primary objective of this study is to determine the lowest effective concentration of 
intralesional triamcinolone acetonide in the treatment of nail psoriasis.

 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS 
 All concomitant medication usage from the period of 60 days prior to the trial through the 
trial period shall be documented and include the following information:  
1. Medication 
2. Indication 
3. Dosage (including frequency) 
4. Start / Stop date 
All concomitant medication usage will be checked with respect to exclusion criteria and 
cross-referenced to adverse events (if any). 
 
RESEARCH DESIGN / METHODS 
 
Our approach is to assess the efficacy and safety of different concentrations of ITA in 
the treatment of nail psoriasis. A similar approach has been taken with psoriasis of the 
skin, and alopecia areata.[15, 16] 
 
Hypothesis: The lowest concentration of ITA tested offers the best ratio of efficacy to 
safety. 
 
Study Design: A total of [ADDRESS_1038489] 
the nature of the study, its requirements and its restrictions during the Informed Consent 
Process. 
 
11 
 The following will be performed at the screening visit: 
• Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• Medical history and demographics including age, gender, history of psoriasis 
• Review of medications 
• Examination of the fingernails 
• Possible tissue sampling (clippi[INVESTIGATOR_758410]) to rule out onychomycosis 
• X-ray of the affected hand 
• Administration of a survey assessing quality of life at baseline. 
• Use the study intervention (intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injections) 
on your fingernail(s) 
 
Eliciting the patient history and physical exam are part of standard clinical practice. 
Nail psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis. Tissue sampling may be taken if there is a question 
about diagnosis, or if there is a possible confounding diagnosis such as onychomycosis. 
X-rays of the hand may also be taken to determine if there is co-existing arthritic 
involvement, which is very common in nail psoriasis. Both of these events are part of 
standard clinical practice and are not research-related procedures. Patients who only 
decline to obtain x-rays won’t be excluded from the study. 
 
After completion of the informed consent process, the study site will take photos of the 
affected fingernails proposed for enrollment.  
 
Washout Period: Subjects who are using any form of treatment on their nails at the time 
of the screening visit may participate in the study provided that they are willing to 
undergo a two-month washout period. During this time, they must abstain from using 
any nail treatments (including, but not limited to: spa nail treatments, nail polish use, 
prescribed topi[INVESTIGATOR_758411], over the counter nail 
treatments, or any other nail intervention with the exception of routine clippi[INVESTIGATOR_758412].) After the washout period, the subject may be re-evaluated for participation in 
the study. 
 
12 
 Enrollment and Randomization: Patients with at least two affected fingernails will be 
enrolled. For each participant, one fingernail will receive an intralesional injection of 0.1-
0.2 mL of normal saline (placebo). The other affected fingernail(s) will receive an 
injection of 0.1-0.2mL of a pre-determined concentration of ITA. Four concentrations of 
ITA will correspond to four study groups: 2.5mg/mL, 5mg/mL, 7.5mg/mL and 10mg/mL. 
Participants’ fingernails will be randomized such that there are approximately equal 
numbers of fingernails in each of the five groups (four study interventions, one placebo). 
To avoid bias, fingernails will be assigned to groups systematically. Fingernails will be 
assigned to groups in order of anatomical convention. For example, if the subject has 
involvement of both the thumb, forefinger and third finger of the right hand, the thumb is 
the first digit, so, if involved, it will be assigned first according to the table below. If a 
subject has involvement of fingernails of both the right and left hand, the fingernails of 
the right hand will be assigned before the left. The table assumes that up to 50 nails will 
be affected between the 10 subjects enrolled. In our clinical experience, this is a 
reasonable expectation. If more or fewer fingernails are involved during the enrollment 
period, the randomization table will be adjusted accordingly. The concentration of ITA 
injected will be different for each group. All other study procedures will be the same 
between groups.

 Procedures: Injections of ITA will be administered using standard methods. Hand 
hygiene procedures will be performed and the administrator will use gloves. 
Triamcinolone acetonide, at the determined dose, will be drawn into a solution of 1% 
lidocaine. The nail fold of the affected nail will be cleaned with an alcohol swab. In 
addition to the local anesthetic given as part of the injection, the area will be 
anesthetized with an ethyl chloride spray immediately prior to injection using a [ADDRESS_1038490] of care regarding the concentration; all concentrations 
under investigation are part of typi[INVESTIGATOR_758413].[1] The purpose of this study is to determine the lowest effective concentration 
of ITA in the treatment of nail psoriasis. 
 
The schedule of treatments is as follows: 
Treatment will be performed using ITA with a frequency of once per 6 weeks +/- [ADDRESS_1038491] visit: 
x Completion of Nail Psoriasis Severity Index  
x Collection of survey to document subject's quality of life 
x Use the study intervention (intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injections) on 
the subject’s fingernail(s) 
x Take pi[INVESTIGATOR_758414]’s nails before and possibly after treatment 
x Take an X-ray of the affected hand 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1038492], and at 
the follow-up visit: 
● Measurements of clear nail growth (in millimeters), clear nail area (in mm2)  
● Completion of Nail Psoriasis Severity Index.  
● Use the study intervention (intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injections) on 
the subject’s fingernail(s) 
● Take pi[INVESTIGATOR_758414]’s nails before and possibly after treatment 
● Collection of adverse events, if there are any  
 The following procedures will be performed at the follow-up visit only:  
● Measurements of clear nail growth (in millimeters), clear nail area (in mm2)  
● Completion of Nail Psoriasis Severity Index.  
● Take pi[INVESTIGATOR_758414]’s nails  
● Collection of survey to document subject's changes in quality of life since the 
beginning of the study intervention and subjective assessment of nail since the beginning of the study intervention  
 
ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING 
 
Adverse event/effect (AE) assessment will be ongoing throughout the study. All adverse 
events shall be reported by [CONTACT_758430]’s reporting policies.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Effect (UAE) 
An unanticipated adverse effect is an adverse effect on health and safety caused by, or 
associated with, the study intervention, if that problem was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any 
other unanticipated  problem that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 
16 
 The Investigator shall be responsible for determination of the causal relationship of all 
adverse events to the study intervention and/or procedure. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_758415].  
 
Any adverse events will be reviewed and analyzed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_758416]’s binder. Any unexpected 
adverse reactions will be reported by [CONTACT_512176] 48 hours of observing 
the event.  
 
No major adverse effects are anticipated during this study; however, we will screen for 
severe pain (Pain ≥ 8/10 on self-reported scale).  
 
The following minor adverse effects are anticipated: cold/burning sensation, minor to 
moderate pain (Pain ≤7 on VAS scale), minor swelling (edema), minor hematomas, and temporary erythema (redness). We will screen for additional possible but not expected 
adverse effects. If the minute treatment reaches an intolerable threshold of pain >7, the 
study intervention will be stopped and more anesthetic may be applied if appropriate. 
Such pain could result from local injection of the skin.  A physician will be on site for the to assess for adverse events as needed.

EFFICACY EVALUATIONS 
 The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the lowest effective concentration of 
intralesional triamcinolone acetonide in the treatment of nail psoriasis. Safety and 
tolerability shall be determined based on the reported number of adverse events as 
outlined in the Adverse Events Section and subject-reported symptoms (if any).  
 
In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed treatment, high quality photographs will 
be taken before and after treatment using standardized lighting, exposure settings, and subject positioning. Trained individuals shall assess the changes in the photographs as 
outlined in the following paragraphs. 
 
Preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the study intervention will be determined by 
[CONTACT_758431]. This growth will be compared to the initial 
amount of clear nail recorded at baseline. Changes in clear area and NaPSI will also be 
reviewed as study intervention progresses and compared to baseline values.  
 
INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD 
 
Prior to beginning this study, approval for all study related documents (protocol, consent 
form, advertising) will be obtained from the Weill Cornell Medical College IRB. 
 
[ADDRESS_1038493] intensity will be assessed at each of the treatment visits using a 0-3 scale 
(0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) for each side effect with changes from baseline 
analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and presented as medians and ranges.  
 
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  
Two-tailed P < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

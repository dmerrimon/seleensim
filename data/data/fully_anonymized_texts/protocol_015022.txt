7, 9, 12.5, 13.1.1  • Due to limited power, the exploratory aim was 
revised to remove e xplorat ion of possible 
impact and utility of the intervention  and 
instead address assessment of candidate 
intermediary and outcome measures  
(addressed throughout and in statistical plan, 
section 9) ; 
• Clarification of what is considered success for 
Aims 1 -2 (i.e., minimum recruitment rate, 
average completion times, average ratings, see 
4.8) 
• Change in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_552884] (now using SUDS to assess 
safety instead of CSSRS ; see 4.5  and 12.5 ) 
• Clarification of intervention design based on 
developed feedback and final prototype (see 
4.6, 6) 
• Removal of stratification procedures for 
gender due to pi[INVESTIGATOR_552885] (see 4.7 , 5.5) 
• Addition of missing measures  collected (see 
Figure 2 , Table 1, section 7 ) 
• Included list of IRB approved consent/assent 
documents (13.1.1)  
• Addition of Electronic Signatures  Meeting with statistician

11.4 • The specific primary outcomes and candidate 
exploratory outcomes were added to the 
statistical analysis section to ensure 
consistency across the document;  
• The appendices listing consent and assent 
documents were removed since 
clinicaltrials.gov requires final consent 
uploaded at the completion of the trial.  
• We have clarified that the worksheets are 
provided by [CONTACT_552980] a workbook aligned to the 
intervention . 
• We have removed the virtual reality  Intro to 
CBT module as we were unable to include 
this in the final intervention.  
• Based on previous DSMB review, we revised 
our safety protocol in 11.4  (these changes 
were made in version 1.2; however, we 
missed one instance in 11.4 and corrected it 
for 1.3) : Previously, we indicated that

• Relaxation was changed to Affect Regulation  
• The Authoritative School Climate Survey 
(ACS) and School Connectedness Scale 
(SCS) were removed from post -intervention

• Admission and discharge date were added to 
information collected from medical record  Medical record s will be 
collected during baseline 
and again at 3 -months to 
ensure consistency and

7.4 • We corrected an error in which the protocol 
stated the 3 -month follow -up assessments 
were anchored to discharge, but they are 
anchored to school re-entry.  
 
• We have allowed post -intervention 
assessments to be completed following 
discharge as needed.  The full protocol anchors 
follow -up appointments to 
school re -entry (not 
discharge) and this was 
inconsistent with the other 
aspects of the protocol.

7 • We identified an error in study suspension 
procedures (a 3 -point increase pre/post VR 
on the 0 -10 distress scale was meant to signal 
concern , and the protocol mistakenly reports 
this as a 30% increase when it is actually  a 
300% increase.  
• The abbreviated feedback form completed by 
[CONTACT_552982] a percentage 
calculation error, as a 
30% increase would be a 
much too small threshold 
and a 300% increase is 
considered appropriate.

participating with a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552890] (not 
part of the randomized trial) was clarified  and 
revised  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552891] ; 
given the open trial does 
not follow outcomes, but 
rather, aims to inform 
implementation, we have 
revised eligibility criteria 
for these patients.  Note 
that the randomized trial 
eligibility  remains the 
same.

Aim 2 : Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_552900] 
(including motion sickness screening), fidelity of the intervention 
delivery (including applying the PrESR to existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552901] ( CBT ) protocols), candidate i ntermediary  variables  
(i.e., threat habitation, cognition), and candidate outcomes (psychological 
distress, self -efficacy, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
 
 
 
Exploratory Aim:  Because this study is a treatment development study, 
an exploratory aim is to calculate descriptive statistics for candidate 
proximal  outcome variables to inform power for a future study  that 
examines efficacy of the intervention . 
 
 
Target Population  This study recruits a  prospective  sample of youth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552902] -
related crises. Based on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53395], adolescents are expected to 
be 65% female, 15% Hispanic or Latino, 65% Caucasian and 30% 
minority across all aims.  
 
Adolescent Inclusion Criteria : 1) current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552903], 2) ages 13 -18; 3) expected return to school 
following discharge, 4) ability to speak, read, and understand English 
sufficiently to complete study procedures, 5) consent of a parent/legal 
guard ian (in English or Spanish), and 6) adolescent assent.  
 
Adolescent Exclusion Criteria :  1) evidence of active psychosis; 2)  
evidence of  intellectual disability ; 3) Cybersickness ( 50th percentile as 
measured on the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire).  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552904] : A clinician at the treatment 
site(s) who delivers treatment (potentially including CBT) to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_368919]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552905], with 
the exception of inclusion criteria #3 (“expected return to school 
following discharge”) and may be included irrespective of school status.  
Numbers of Enrollees   
Adolescent Participants  
Target sample size is  N = 48 enrolled adolescents . 
 
Recruitment will continue until N = [ADDRESS_726698] complete data or  until the study end 
date. We anticipate 20% of attrition; however , the purpose of this study 
is to explore feasibility and acceptability of intervention and study 
protocols, with true estimates of attrition unknown (attrition rate  is 
considered  to be  an estimand of the study).  
                                                                                                                                                      
 
Up to 1,000 individuals will be recruited and screen ed.

to 12 individuals will be recruited.  
 
Intervention s The PrESR VR supplement will focus on increasing acquisition and 
utilization of critical cognitive -behavioral skills for treating adolescents 
with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. All participants will receive  
treatment as usual  during inpatient  and all adolescents will receive  
research -related  worksheets instructing them on target cognitive 
behavioral skills ( introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive 
restructuring, problem solving, and affect regulation) aligning to 
worksheets used as part of typi[INVESTIGATOR_552907]. Adolescents 
receiving the intervention will practice skills using the PrESR , which will 
provide clinical guidance and feedback. Following a similar format to 
other therapeutic VR programs, a research clinician  will observe 
adolescents wearing standard headsets as they learn and practice copi[INVESTIGATOR_552908] (school) 
stressors . At the end of the program, the adolescent and research clinician 
will develop a safety plan designed to address the return to school, based 
on these in vivo sessions and , when possible,  in collaboration with the 
school. CBT skills provided through worksheets will follow a standard 
format across participants , with VR enhanced CBT skills based on 
randomization to intervention component .   
 
Outcome Measures   
For Aim 1. Feasibility  and acceptability of identifying, enrolling, and 
retaining participants at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552909]: (1) rates of 
recruitment  (proportion of >50th percentile as measured on the Motion 
Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire) ; (2) rates of retention  (and reasons 
participants cite for withdrawing from the study) . 
 
For Aim 2. Feasibility and acceptability of implementing assessment 
protocols (including motion sickness screening)  and intervention delivery 
(including applying the PrESR to existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552910]) will be 
assessed in four ways: (1) time to complete assessments; (2) time to 
complete the intervention; (3) ability of research staff to deliver 
intervention with fidelity ; (4) adolescent participant feedback about the 
intervention (exit interview and feedback form); and ( 5) professional  
feedback about the intervention (focus group interviews or one -on-one 
interviews , feedback questionnaire ).  
 
Exploratory Aim: Because this study is a treatment development study, 
candidate proximal  outcomes of psychological distress  (as measured by 
[CONTACT_552986] [CASI ]; Beck Hopelessness Scale 
[BHS ]; Emotional Distress -Anxiety /Depression  - Pediatric Short Form 
[PROMIS ]) and self -efficacy  (as measured by [CONTACT_552987] -

The pi[INVESTIGATOR_552911] a balan ced 2x2x2 full 
factorial to examine each component ( VR enhanced cognitive 
restructuring, problem -solving, and affect regulation) across  treatment 
level (standard vs. standard + PRESR). All participants  will receive 
standard treatment, as well as researcher provided  worksheets addressing 
introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive restructuring, 
problem -solving, and affect regulation aligned to standard procedures, but 
the experimental  conditions will vary according to VR enhancement of 
each skill. With this design, primary focus will be on calculating key 
statistics ( means, standard deviations [SDs], correlations) and 
distributional properties of candidate  proximal  outcome  variables based 
on condition  of skill use  (n=24 per group  for each of the skills assessed ) 
to provide an assessment of these  variables.

2. Introduction  
2.1  Background Information  
Rates  of suicide  and suicide -related  thoughts  and behaviors  increased  among  adolescents  over the decade  prior  to 
COVID -19. Based  on data collected  as part of the national  Youth  Risk Behavior  Survey  (YRBS),  13.8%  of 
adolescents  reported  seriously  considering  attempting  suicide  in 2009,  compared  to 18.8%  in 2019;  6.3%  reported  
having  attempted  suicide  in 2009,  compared  to 8.9%  in 2019  (CDC, 2019) . Since  the onset  of COVID -19, there  has 
been  a significant increase in concerns for depression and suicide -related risk within pediatric primary care settings 
for adolescent girls (Mayne et al., 2021) . Moreover, r ates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a suspected suicide attempt were 
significantly higher in the winter of 2021 compared to the previous year (Yard et al., 2021) .  More generally, 
suicidal thoughts and behaviors are a primary reason for psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552912] 50% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_368919]  (Peterson et al., 1996; Tossone et al., 2014) . Therefore , this intervention targets adolescents 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552902] -related crises.  
 
Although the effectiveness of psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552913]  (Jobes, 2017; 
Jobes et al., 2008) , it remains standard practice for most individuals at high-risk for making a suicide attempt  (Kidd 
et al., 2014) . Inpatient treatment appears most effective when it involves cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based 
problem -solving skills  (Blanz & Schmidt, 2000; Frazier et al., 2016; Green et al., 2007) . CBT is well suited for

Template Version  1.0            2021 -09-09 acute treatment of adolescents in crisis because it is an evidence -based, transdiagnostic intervention for reducing 
self-harm behaviors, appropriate for the multidetermined risk of suicide  (Alavi et al., 2013; Esposito -Smythers et 
al., 2011; Ghahramanlou -Holloway et al., 2015; Ougrin et al., 2015) . Unfortunately, a key mechanism  of CBT skill 
learning is practicing skills in real life  (Kazantzis et al., 2000; Stanley et al., 2009) , something that is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_552914].  
 
Following discharge, youth are at increased risk for subsequent suicide attempts or re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552915]  (Brent et al., 1993; Chung et al., 2017; Goldston et al., 1999, 2001; Horwitz et al., 2015; James 
et al., 2010; Stensland et al., 2012; Wolff et al., 2017) . Multiple studies underscore the importance of immediate, 
intensive interventions focused on relapse prevention, followed -up with close monitoring of adolescents after 
discharge  (Goldston et al., 1998, 1999, 2001, 2009; Kelley et al., 1996; Prinstein et al., 2008) . Yet, post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552916], with many adolescents receiving inadequate or no ongoing treatment  (Brown & 
Jager -Hyman, 2014; James et al., 2010; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_552917]., 2010) . Many adolescents return to school at high -risk for 
making a suicide attempt without ongoing treatment in place  (Brown & Jager -Hyman, 2014; Daniel et al., 2009) .  
Moreover, adolescents report distinct concerns about returning to school following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], including 
ongoing management of symptoms, social stressors, and academic concerns  (M. Marraccini & PI[INVESTIGATOR_552918], 2022; 
Preyde et al., 2018) . 
 
Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is a novel way to enhance treatments applicable to lived settings. VR integrates 
computer graphics, body tracing, and sensory inputs to simulate life -like experiences  (Lewis et al., 2018) . By 
[CONTACT_552988] -computer interactions, VR -based applications provide systematic training and practice in 
settings that mirror the real -world  (Hubal & Parsons, 2017) . Decades of research and development support the VR 
as a novel tool for training and practice conditions to promote skill development  (Hubal, 2008; Hubal & Parsons, 
2017) . Increasing the ecological validity of assessments, virtual school environments can measure attention and 
cognition  (Parsons, 2015; Rizzo et al., 2009)  and students’ tendency towards risky behavior  (Hubal et al., 2015; 
Hubal & Parsons, 2017) . Evidence supporting VR therapeutically demonstrates that VR exposure therapy has 
comparable effects to lived  exposure therapy for real -life anxiety reduction  (Carl et al., 2019; Morina et al., 2015) . 
 
In order to enhance clinical treatment of adolescents with suicide -related risk, this study is conducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_552919] a novel intervention to supplement inpatient treatment, the Practice Experiences for School 
Reintegration  (PrESR) program. During its development, we have sought feedback from school professionals, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489273] , and adolescents previously hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a suicide -related crises. Difficult school scenarios 
are based on this expert feedback, and also built from our previous work identifying adolescent, parent, school 
professional, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552920] -related influences of suicide -related risk  (M. E.

specific exclusion s (i.e., active psychosis, intellectual  disability) base d on expert feedback during model 
development (unpublished data  collected from earlier phases of the study ).

The larger study involves several aspects of preparation of the MOST phase, specifically involving developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
refining, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_552923]. Aims for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_552924]:  
 
3.[ADDRESS_726700] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_552925] (including motion sickness screening), fidelity of the intervention delivery (including 
applying the PrESR to existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552910]), measuring candidate intermediary variable s (i.e., 
threat habitation, cognition), and measuring candidate outcomes (psychological distress, self -efficacy, 
suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
 
3.3 Exploratory Aim  
Because this study is a treatment development study, an exploratory aim is to calculate descriptive statistics 
for candidate outcome variables to inform power for a future study that examines efficacy of the 
intervention.  
 
4 Study Design  
 
This Stage I Behavioral Intervention Development study  follows a multiphasic optimization (MOST)  research 
design  to prepare for a subsequent fully powered optimization trial and RCT ; this clinical trial is considered  to be  a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_552926] . MOST is a comprehensive framework for optimizing and 
evaluating multi -component behavioral interventions. MOST has three phases: preparation , optimization , and 
evaluation  (Collins & Kugler, 2018) , with the optimization trial typi[INVESTIGATOR_552927] a factorial design.  
 
For the present study, a  prospective sample of adolescents (N= 48) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552928] 8 experimental conditions (N=5 -6 per group)  adhering to the “intent to treat” 
principle .  
 
Adolescents will be invited to participate based on pre -screening of medical records to identify eligible participants. 
Prior to  or immediately following consent /permission/assent procedures , adolescent participants will complete a 
motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire. Adolescents at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_552929] (Kidd et al., 2014) , 
which is defined as  50th percentile as measured on the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire  (Golding, 
1998) , will be excluded from the study based on screen  failure . 
 
The intervention will be tested during the participant’s index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], with data collection at baseline, over 
the [ADDRESS_726701] -school re -entry  
(longitudinal). Participation is expected to take approximately 12 hours, and include consent/assent ( 30 min.), 3 -7

in Marraccini et al., 2025) . 
 
As part of training in the new research intervention, research staff are being trained to provide validation of any 
difficulties and copi[INVESTIGATOR_552930]. In addition, participants are informed that participation in this 
study is voluntary and that they can withdraw without penalty. If participants become distressed when completing 
assessments, or are too distressed to complete assessments, research  staff can discontinue or delay the assessments 
at that point.  
 
Although the intervention for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_552931] a member of research staff, this 
study will also  aim to  recruit [ADDRESS_726702] completed the study if they contribute data during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552932] -month follow -up assessment.  
4.2 Discontinuation of Study Intervention/Experimental Manipulation  
The study intervention or assessments may be discontinued if, in the judgment of direct care and clinical staff at the 
psychiatric facility, youths' clinical situation (e.g., their level of agitation) appears to be worsening as a result of 
continuing effor ts to implement the intervention or conduct assessments. A participant may also be withdrawn if 
s/he is declining to complete the assessments for the study.  
4.3 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participation in this study is completely voluntary and participants (youth or guardians ) are free to withdraw 
consent/assent at any time without penalty. The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal, if given, will 
be recorded.  Participant discontinuation or withdrawal will be recorded on case report forms.

study staff are unable to contact [CONTACT_552990]. Before a participant is deemed lost to 
follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] , including, at a 
minimum, three phone calls to the  respective participant’s  family  whose contact [CONTACT_552991]/assent .  
4.5 Study Discontinuation and Closure  
This study may be temporarily suspended  or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written 
notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_206092] , or 
terminating party to the funding agency, regulatory authorities, and any youth and family already in the follow -up 
phase of the study.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will 
promptly inform study part icipants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor/funding age ncy and will 
provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be 
informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
1. Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants : If [ADDRESS_726704] a 30 0% increase in distress  
(as measured by [CONTACT_552992] a practice experience in PrESR, averaged 
across practice sessions ), the study will be suspended  
2. Insufficient compliance of study staff to the protocol ( i.e., significant protocol violations)  
3. Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
 
The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed and satisfy 
the funding agency, sponsor, IRB, or other relevant regulatory or oversight bodies (DSMB).

and adolescents will rec eive researcher provided  worksheets instructing them on target cognitive behavioral skills 
(introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, and affect regulation) 
aligning to worksheets used as part of typi[INVESTIGATOR_552933]. Adolescents will practice skills using the PrESR 
with clinical guidance and feedback. Sessions begin with an overview of the skill to be practiced, followed by a 
brief immersive experience using virtual reality designed to mimic difficult school experiences  in which 
adolescents are able to practice the learned skill . Participants receiving the intervention will also be provided  with a  
workbook  used during sessions that align  to their lessons and practices  in PrESR.  
  
Following a similar format to other therapeutic VR programs, research clinicians will observe adolescents wearing 
standard headsets as they practice copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]. At the end of the program, the adolescent and clinician will 
develop a safety plan designed to address the return to school, based on these in vivo sessions and , if possible,  in 
collaboration with the school. Selection of individual VR scenarios and number of lessons delivered to teach each 
CBT skill is determined based on the needs of  individual patients , with the goal of providing at least two practice 
opport unities per skill . Note that although participants are randomized based on skill components (affect regulation, 
cognitive restructuring, problem solving), all participants receiving at least one component of the intervention will 
also collaborate on a safety plan.  
 
This specific sequence was selected to allow individuals to become habituated to anxiety or distress provoking 
situations, and to use copi[INVESTIGATOR_552934]. The conceptual model (shown in Figure 1 in Marraccini et al., 
2025)  posits two mechanisms for change that lead to skill mastery and application: (1) habituation to fear based on 
inhibitory learning; and (2) cognitive shifts in beliefs and appraisals. As adolescents begin to increase their 
tolerance to these difficult expe riences and shift away from faulty thinking and towards acceptance, they are able to 
build and apply skills in low-risk settings initially (i.e., mixed reality settings during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and extend 
them into higher risk settings (i.e., in school post -discharge).  
 
Inhibitory learning with exposure increases fear tolerance by [CONTACT_552993] (secondary) non -threat based 
associations (i.e., school experiences and skill use) with the original threat -based associations (i.e., school 
experiences and psychological distress) remaining intact  (Kidd et al., 2014) . Because habituation is understood as 
dynamic throughout exposure, in that it can deescalate and escalate in accordance with the intensity of exposure  
(Jobes, 2017) , it will be measured with a Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) provided by [CONTACT_552994], 
between, and following VR sessions  to measure self -reported levels of distress . Note, however, that the PrESR 
differs from classic exposure therapy in that it is active, as opposed to passive. Where habituation during exposure 
discourages the use of skills such as cognitive restructuring, relaxation techniques, and distraction, beca use they are 
posited to interfere with habituation  (Jobes, 2017) , the PrESR proposes to enhance skill development through 
applied practice in in vivo like experiences. Thus, in addition to tolerance of fear, improvements in outcomes are 
also expected to be mediated by [CONTACT_304598]. Cognitive shifts in thinking are accomplished via the PrESR 
by [CONTACT_552995], reciprocally reinforced by [CONTACT_552996].  
 
These initial increases in fear tolerance and positive changes in cognitions are expected to lead to both reduced 
psychological distress and increased emotional self -efficacy in school, which ultimately will reduce rates of re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552935] t suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

A prospective sample of adolescents (N= 48) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552936] 
a psychiatric inpatient unit . An even number of  participants will be assigned  into one of eight conditions (see Table 
shown in Figure 2 ) in block sizes of 8, 16, or [ADDRESS_726706] framework, with conditions varying based on 
participation in the PrESR for specific skills or enhanced treatment as usual (i.e., provision  of worksheets teaching 
CBT skills).  Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], randomization will not be stratified; however, because gender identity may 
be an important stratification variable in a future, fully powered trial, we will collect information related to gender 
identity to inform stratificat ion procedures in the future. A biostatistician  with no other study responsibilities will 
set up randomization tables for use in REDCap  (a secure web -based service for building and managing online 
surveys and databases), and other research staff will not have access to the tables. Participants will be randomized 
following the baseline assessment using the randomize feature in REDCap. This ensures allocation concealment.

Exploratory Aim:  Assessment of Candidate Pr oximal  Outcomes  
As a treatment development study, this project is not powered to test hypotheses  regarding efficacy . To demonstrate 
the potential viability of the approach, we will use this data to obtain precise enough estimate of these statistics in 
order to make reasonable guesses as to how to design the fully powered and definitive trial.  Additionally, feasibility 
and acceptability of collecting other outcomes of interest (mechanisms and distal outcomes) require the following 
measures  to be collected/administered  (outcome measures are  shown in Table 1) : 
 
Exploratory  Intermediary  Variables : Threat habituation : Subjective Units of Distress Scale  (SUDS) ; 
Cognition : Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ -30);  
 
Exploratory Candidate Proximal Primary Outcomes : Psychological distress:  Child Anxiety Sensitivity Index  
(CASI) ; Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS); Emotional Distress -Anxiety /Depression  - Pediatric Short Form 
(PROMIS).  Self-efficacy: Emotional Self -Efficacy (ESE) measure .

limit. We also anticipate that more adolescents will be consented into the study and excluded due to screening 
procedures following consent (see exclusion criteria).  
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_552943] 1-2 UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s, well -known as a leading center for psychiatric care.

5.3 Enrollment/Selection Strategies  
 5.3.1.   Prospective Recruitment     
A prospective sample of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552951].  The study  will use 
effective recruitment protocols involving approval  from the treating clinician, screening via chart review, and 
approach and consent completed by [CONTACT_552998] . 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_552952] -related risk in her role as a 
postdoctoral fellow on a federally funded grant and additional experience in recruiting adolescents with suicide -
related risk following hospit alization on several research studies as PI.  
 
Because this study focuses on adolescents, specific protections will be employed.  Decisions regarding whether an 
adolescent will be invited to participate  or not will be determined in collaboration  with their attending physician . 
Adolescents will also be screened for risk of motion/cyber sickness.  
 
We will take precautions to minimize coercion to participate. We will emphasize the voluntary nature of the study 
and remind participants that they may discontinue at any time. Members of the research team will be trained to be 
respectful towards participa nts' preferences regarding participation. We will present information verbally and in 
writing on the consent form to ensure participants are aware of the voluntary nature of the study. The informed 
consent procedure will include a careful explanation of st udy procedures, risks, benefits, and alternatives. We have 
selected compensation rates that we believe will not be excessive or coercive for adolescents.  All participating 
children will complete assent procedures after or simultaneously to when consent is given by [CONTACT_3654]. Children can 
refuse to answer individual questions or withdraw from the study at any time . 
 
 
 5.3.2.  Screen Failures     
We expect approximately 20% of consented individuals to be ineligible for the study following consent due to 
cybersickness. Accordingly, we will explain this exclusion criteria during the consent process. We do not expect 
individuals determined to be ineligible will be re -screened given the short -time frame available to complete stu dy 
procedures during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
5.[ADDRESS_726719] information from 
multiple members of the family  (based on family preference to respect any privacy concerns related to eligibility 
for study)  and providing study visit reminders. As needed, we will also develop protocols for follow -ups 
administered remotely in cases where transportation is difficult.  
5.5 Matching and Stratification  
Youth identifying as gender diverse at greater risk for suicide -related thoughts and behaviors compared to those 
identifying as cisgender  (Marraccini, Ingram, et al., 2022) . We will collect information about gender identity 
(cisgender boy, cisgender girl, or gender diverse [e.g., transgender or nonbinary ]) based on participant self-report . 
Given the small sample size  of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_552953] , we will 
not stratify by [CONTACT_552999] a stratification procedure for a future,  fully powered  trial that will have large enough recruit ment to 
target a balanced design.

Description     
As shown in Table 10.1, there are 8 intervention conditions with 4-6 participants per condition. Each condition is 
based on whether or not  the participant receives the virtual reality supplement (PrESR) to learning three  skills : 
affect regulation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving. All three skills  will be provided by [CONTACT_553000]  (irrespective of condition assignment) . For each skill, if participants 
receive the supplemental intervention, participants will be guided to learn and practice the skill in a virtual reality 
session  under the supervision of a trained researcher . Skills are int roduced, and then participants engage  in an 
immersive school scenario that involves several difficult social interactions and/or academic stressors, in which the 
participant can pause and practice using the target skill. At the close of each session, participants will complete a 
debrief with the onsite researcher . If participants receive any component of the intervention (conditions 2 -8), they 
will also collaborate on a safety plan at the conclusion of the intervention.  
 
Adherence Monitoring/Evaluations   Researchers  will be observing participants during sessions to monitor 
participation in treatment.   
 
Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_552954] 
(affect regulation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving) . Families will be provided an authorization to release 
information , and, with permission, information from the assessments collected as part of the study will be shared 
with clinical staff and with the evaluating clinician so they can better address the needs of youth who have been 
suicidal. Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_552955] [ADDRESS_726720]-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552956]

Aims 1 and  2 are assessed qualitatively via transcribed audio recorded interviews, and quantitatively via feedback 
forms, rates of recruitment, retention, time to complete assessments and intervention, and monitoring of 
intervention fidelity. As such, feasibility, safety, and acceptability data are descriptive and qualitative  and do not 
require null hypothesis significance testing  analyses.  
 
Exploratory Aim:  Assessment of  Candidate Proximal Outcomes  
As a treatment development study, this project is not designed to test treatment efficacy . To demonstrate the 
potential viability of the approach, we will examine this data to estimate key statistics of our exploratory outcome 
variables (e.g., frequencies, distributional properties, standard deviations) and their correlations with key 
intermediary variables . The goal is to gain information that will inform the design of a fully powered and definitive 
phase III trial.   
 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_552911] a balanced 2x2x2 full factorial to examine each component ( VR 
enhanced cognitive restructuring, problem -solving, and affect regulation) across treatment level (standard vs. 
standard + PRESR). All patients will receive standard treatment, and will receive worksheets about  cognitive 
restructuring, problem -solving, and affect regulation aligned to standard procedures provided by [CONTACT_33365] , but 
the experimental conditions will vary according to VR enhancement of each skill  (involving a VR lesson and 
practice session) . With this design, primary focus will be on the candi date proximal outcome variables based on  
skill condition . Specific analyses include exploring the distribution and degree of variability among variables,  as 
well as preliminary indicators of  change over time ( e.g., via pre-post comparisons before and after the intervention  
using paired sample t -tests to gauge directionality ; maintenance of change  at 2-week and 3 -month follow -up visits) 
in order to evaluate  which candidate variables are most promising.  
 
As shown in Table 1, candidate outcomes include:  
 
Exploratory  Intermediary  Variables : Threat habituation : Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) ; 
Cognition : Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ -30);  
 
Exploratory Candidate Proximal Primary Outcomes : Psychological distress:  Child Anxiety Sensitivity Index 
(CASI); Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS); Emotional Distress -Anxiety/Depression - Pediatric Short Form 
(PROMIS).  Self-efficacy: Emotional Self -Efficacy (ESE) measure .  
 
Exploratory Candidate Distal Primary Outcomes: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors: Self-Injurious Thoughts 
and Behaviors Interview (SITB); Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (CSSRS) . Rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Medical

Template Version  1.0            2021 -09-09 11 Safety Monitoring and Management  
11.1  Risk / Benefit Assessment  
Potential Risks:    
The primary risks associated with the study are: (1) distress in relation to answering questions about their 
experiences or physical (e.g., motion sickness) or psychological discomfort in relation to viewing /participating in 
stressful  experiences that mimic real life stressors  in the intervention ; (2) coercion to participate in the study; and 
(3) loss of privacy or confidentiality.  In the following sections we outline a number of ways we protect against 
risks.  
Distress/Motion Sickness. Because the intervention provides an immersive experience that mimics real life 
stressors, it is possible that participants will feel distressed or uncomfortable during the intervention . Decisions 
regarding whether an adolescent will be invited to participate or not will be determined in collaboration with their 
attending physician. Additionally, a dolescents at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_552965] (50th percentile as measured on 
the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire) will b e excluded from the study.  Staff will be trained to provide 
validation and reduce stress during interactions, and to monitor physical safety during participation. Participants 
and staff will be taught how to end the intervention should they feel too stressed or agitated. Participant s will be 
reminded that they may pause or end the intervention at any time . All equipment will be thoroughly cleaned before 
and after use.  
Coercion:  We will take precautions to minimize coercion to participate. We will emphasize the voluntary nature of 
the study and remind participants that they may discontinue at any time. Members of the research team will be 
trained to be respectful towards participa nts' preferences regarding participation. We will present information 
verbally and in writing on the consent form to ensure participants are aware of the voluntary nature of the study. 
The informed consent procedure will include a careful explanation of st udy procedures, risks, benefits, and 
alternatives. We have selected compensation rates that we believe will not be excessive or coercive for adolescents.  
Confidentiality or loss of  privacy.  The information we are collecting is considered potentially sensitive and as 
such participants could experience distress or increased psychological risk if information is improperly handled or 
released inappropriately. Potential risk from breach of confide ntiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_553003]. Study data will only be identified by [CONTACT_553004]. 
All electronic data will be stored on a secure server. Data will only be stored on password -protected computers and 
electronic transmission of identifying data will not be permitted. Team members accessing data and identifying 
information will be trained on the management of sensitive clinical information. All data will be considered 
confidential, and only trained research staff will have access to data.  
 
Potential Benefits:  
It is possible that adolescents receiving the PrESR intervention may benefit; however, the efficacy of the PrESR for 
reducing psychological distress and preventing suicide -related thoughts and behaviors is unknown. Additional 
benefits may involve increased monitoring of suicidal -thoughts and behaviors as part of follow -up procedures.  
 
11.2  Assessment of Safety  
Safety will be assessed  throughout the intervention  by [CONTACT_553005] .  
 
Eligible participants will be recruited with permission of the treating clinician and screened for motion sickness  
using the following assessment protocols:

Template Version  1.0            2021 -09-09 • Motion Sickness  Susceptibility  Questionnaire (MS SQ) 
 
Participants will be taught how to complete a SUDS scale and reminded of the potential risks of the intervention 
prior to beginning each session. Participants and clinicians will be taught how to immediately pause or end the 
intervention as needed, and clinicians will be trained to monitor participant safety during the intervention (i.e., 
watching where the ir body is at all times, validating and supporting their experiences).  The intervention will be 
administered at the psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], with trained cl inical staff available to support patients as needed.  
Participants are a vulnerable population (adolescents with a recent suicide -related crises) and the intervention is 
designed to supplement treatment as usual. Accordingly, all participants will receive treatment as usual and if 
randomized to participat e in one of the conditions of  the intervention will not disrupt other necessary treatments or 
interventions.  
11.3  Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events  
Unanticipated Problems:     
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_9155] ( OHRP).  An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience or outcome that meets all three 
OHRP criteria (1) unexpected (in severity, specificity, frequency, or nature), (2) related or possibly related to 
the research, and (3) suggests the research places participant s or others at greater risk than previously known or 
recognized. Only a subset of adverse events will meet criteria for unanti cipated problems.   
 
Adverse Event (AE) Definitions: This protocol uses the definition of adverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered 
intervention -related . 
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Definition: A serious adverse event  is an adverse event that results in death, is 
life-threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in disability, is a congenital anomaly, or is a medically important 
event . 
 
 
Grading the Severity of Adverse Events and Events of ‘Special Interest’: For adverse events (AEs), the 
following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate 
events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “serious”. ] 
 
In this study, serious/severe adverse events include expected events such as suicide attempts, emergency 
department visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].   
 
Relatedness Definition:  All adverse events (AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the 
intervention, assessed by [CONTACT_175312]/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study procedures caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study procedures and the 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evi dence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
procedures and the AE.

Template Version  1.0            2021 -09-09 • Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures caused the event, there is no 
temporal relationship between the study procedures and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been 
established.  
 
Expectedness Definition:   
A clinician with appropriate expertise in suicidal thoughts and behaviors and non -suicidal self -injury will be 
responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity,  or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study procedures.  
 
AE and SAE Assessment, Follow -up Procedures: The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse 
event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant.    
 
All AEs, not otherwise precluded per the protocol, will be captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). 
Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship 
to study procedures (asse ssed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be documented appropriately regardless 
of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate r esolution.  
 
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each 
level of severity to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_552966].  
 
Designated study personnel will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each study 
visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for 
outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
Reporting and Documentation Procedures:  
Any unanticipated problems or serious and unexpected adverse events will be promptly reported by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_552967], DSMB and sponsor or appropriate government 
agency if appropriate.  
 
Participant Notification of New Information :    
Participants will be informed of new information related to the study or intervention that might influence their 
interest/willingness to participate in the study.  
11.[ADDRESS_726730].  
A Data Safety & Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be utilized, (see Section 16.6). Screening and assessment of 
motion sickness will be monitored and documented. Add itionally, self -report measures of distress based on SUDS 
scales will be collected throughout the intervention ; simulation sickness will be measured  prior to and  following the 
initial virtual reality session; and distress level  will be measured pre - and post -intervention completion .

12 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight  Specifications  
 
12.1  Informed Consent Process  
 
Assent and consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be given to 
the participant and caregiver. Consent and assent will be obtained in -person using paper forms, or virtually using 
electronic capture with  a REDC ap or Qualtrics interface. Offering in -person and virtual permission for 
parent (s)/guardian (s) is necessary given the constraints of parents with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552968] (e.g., families that live 
farther away from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552969]).   
 
 
 12.1.1.  Consent/Assent and Documents Provided to Participants  
Consent and assent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are provided  to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering 
study intervention . Parent permission will also be available in Spanish , but adolescent participants will need 
proficiency in English to complete the intervention (which is only available in English) . 
 
 
 12.1.2.  Consent Procedures and Documentation  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and 
continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved and the participan t will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator  or research assistant  
will explain the research study to the parent/guardian  and participant and answer any questions that may arise. A 
verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to  the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, 
and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  Participants (and their parents, if 
applicable) will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to 
signing. The participants will be provided  the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or 
think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document prio r to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study. Permission and assent will be available in paper format and 
electronically via REDCap  or Qualtrics  in case parent(s)/guardian(s)  are not available in -person. Participants must 
be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records (either 
electronically or in  paper format). The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source 
document (including the date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures. 
The rights and wel fare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_309466].  
 
To ensure a standardized approach that ensures all elements of informed consent/assent are covered, we will 
develop a sample script for introducing the research study. Prior to the beginning of consent/assent procedures, we 
will role play administration of  consent/assent with researchers providing consent  and provide feedback.  
 
Practice Experiences for School Reintegration    Version 1.11 
UNC IRB Protocol ID #[ADDRESS_726732]. However, to participate in the 
study, both assent and consent will be required.  
 
In general, it should take no longer than 15 minutes to obtain consent/assent. However, as much time as needed will 
be allocated for answering any questions about the study.    
 
Participants and parent(s)/guardian(s)  will be advised that if they have any questions about the research study, they 
can contact [CONTACT_54852] (for whom the appropriate telephone number is provided). Participants will 
also be informed that if they have any questions regarding th eir rights as research subjects, they may contact [CONTACT_553006].  
 
Youth who do not understand English will not be enrolled in the study.  Permission  procedures will be made 
available for parent(s)/guardian(s)  speaking Spanish.  
 
Participants will be notified that the UNC School of Medicine is not conducting this study. Participants will be 
apprised of the voluntariness of the research, and that the decision to participate or not will not have an impact on 
medical care or general c onditions while in psychiatric care.   
 
Participants will be apprised that confidentiality will be broken if youth (a) indicate plans to harm themselves, (b) 
indicate plans to harm someone else, and/or (c) disclose previously unreported abuse according to the state of North 
Carolina. This inform ation will be immediately reported to the adolescent’s treatment team or a caregiver during 
follow -up procedures.  
 
During follow -up procedures, adolescents who were previously a minority age who have since turned majority age 
will be re -consented into the study.  
 
12.2  Study Discontinuation and Closure  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written 
notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_411661], the investigator, funding agency, and regulatory authorities .    
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study 
participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or 
suspension. Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
  
Examples  of circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension of the study include:  
1. Criteria established in the MPD for early termination of the study have been satisfied  
2. Detection of an unexpected unacceptable level of risk to participants  
3. In preparatory (pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) studies, futility due to insufficient adherence  to protocol requirements  
4. Unexpected inability to recruit participants  
 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, and satisfy the

timeline of the study, protocol deviations, and factors that may affect the risks and benefits of the study such as 
emerging literature; and (3) making directives about the continuation, modification, o r termination of the study,  
based on the balance of adverse events and beneficial outcomes. Throughout the study, notification of SAEs as well 
as any proposed investigator -initiated changes in the protocol will be submitted to the DSMB. Based on its review  
of the protocol, the DSMB will identify the data parameters and format of the information to be regularly reported. 
The DSMB may at any time request additional information from the Principal Investigators.  
 
12.7  Clinical Monitoring  Plan (CMP)  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of trial participants are protected, that 
the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with 
the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with International Confere nce on Harmonization  Good Clinical 
Practice (ICH GCP), and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
 
A. All SAEs and adverse events (AEs will only be reported to the DSMB annually) will be tabulated and 
submitted to the DSMB in the biannual DSMB data reports. Based on review of safety data, the DSMB will 
issue directives concerning the conduct of the study. Recommendation/directives made by [CONTACT_553011], modifying the protocol or consent, terminating the study,

12.8  Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 
Informed consent --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as well as a 
percentage of the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate compliance with GCP, accuracy, and 
completeness.  Feedback will be provided to the study team to  ensure proper consenting procedures are followed .  
 
Electronic data --- When possible, d ata will be initially captured via a R EDCap Electronic Data Capture system to 
minimize errors. Otherwise, paper data will be entered directly into R EDCap. Electronic data will be reviewed 
regularly for errors, unusual patterns, and outliers that need to be checked.    
 
Intervention Fidelity — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the 
intervention phase of the study  using a fidelity check list.  
 
Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will implement 
corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of concern.  
 
Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9115], source 
data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456]/funding agency, and 
inspection by [CONTACT_242524] y authorities.  
12.9  Protocol Deviations  
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International 
Council on Harmonization  Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of 
deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_553012].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 .  
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1 .  
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_726737] (IRB) and/or doc umented per their policies. The site investigator will be 
responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements.

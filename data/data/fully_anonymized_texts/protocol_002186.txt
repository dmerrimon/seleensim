8. STUDY DESIGN  
a. Background or  rationale for this study.  
As defined by [CONTACT_341843] S tudy of Pain (IASP) pain is 
“an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or  resembling that 
associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.” ( IASP, 2021 ) and one of the most 
 
 [ADDRESS_423244] e experience pain, 
that experience and manifestation of pain is unique to each i ndividual and includes 
physical and psychological factors7 making the managing pain and chronic  pain can a 
difficult thing to achieve.1  
Facing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], th e Centers of Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC)  
reports  that studies of [ADDRESS_423245] common reasons people seek medical 
care is chronic pain;1 however, subclinical pain (mild, low irritability) g enerally does 
not prompt people to seek medical treatment.12,13,14 Subc linical pa in can be measured  
by [CONTACT_224968] (VAS)  score of ≤3.4/10.[ADDRESS_423246] not b een studied 
extensively.  Pain can lead to anxiety (which is often treated with p harmacological 
interventions) and avoidan ce of movement.8,9 Pain and local inflammation in the 
cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341820], coupled with avoidance of movement, can lead t o 
reduced cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341819]. Pain and anxiety are often treated with 
pharmacological interventions.  
We are int erested in learning more about people living with “subclinical” pain. 
According to Grant et al and Browne et al.16,17 people with neck  pain but are not yet 
receiving any treatment as having minor musculoskeletal or “subclinical” pain. 
 
 [ADDRESS_423247] movement and can  lead 
to anxiety, disability , and impaired neck proprioception.12,14,20,21 
People may  as what those non -pharmacologic options that physical therapy can 
offer for pain  management, especially for untreated sub clinical pain? In the field of 
physical therapy biophysical agents are agents that apply forms of energy to 
“modulate or decrease pain ” along with the reduction of “risk factors and 
complications; enhance health, we llness, or fitness; enhance or maintain p hysical 
performance; or prevent or remediate impairments in body functions and structures, 
activity limitations, or participation rest rictions.”22 Within the group of biophysical 
agents is the application and use of  electrical currents, more specifically  
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).[ADDRESS_423248] ac cepted theories for the modulation of pain with the use of TENS is the “gate 
control theory of pain” by [CONTACT_341844] p ublished in 1965.28,[ADDRESS_423249] and brainstem.23 This 
theory also proposed that the substantia gelatinosa (SG) in the dorsal horn of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_341821] a s a gate control system before afferents influence T cells.28 T cells then activa te 
the system responsible for response an d perception.28 Large -diameter afferent nerve 
fibers (facilitates SG) and small -diameter afferent nerve fibers (inhibits SG) influence  
T cells.[ADDRESS_423250] the depolarization of a fferents 
nerves through the adjustment of  parameters of electrical current deliver with 
electrodes through the skin.30 Depolarizing large -diameter (A -beta) sensory afferent 
nerves via sensory TENS can help gate or block noxious input.30,31,[ADDRESS_423251] rical current. TENS is often self -
administered, affordable and safe when compared to medications.23 
 
 6 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_341822], 
there is an “efficacy -impasse” for  clinical utilization of TENS, despi[INVESTIGATOR_341823].34 There is an urgent need for randomized controlled trials to 
investigate TENS effectiveness.34 Based  on this need the purpose of this study is to 
investigate the effects of electrot herapy for improving cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341824], 
reduce pain, anxiety , and disability in adults with subclinical neck or upper quadrant 
pain.  
b. Objectives.  
1) To measure the  immediate and short -term effects of TENS on subclinical neck or 
upper quadrant p ain with the VAS, anxiety with the State -Trait Anxiety Inventory for 
Adults ™, disability with neck disability index (NDI), disability and cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341825]  3D Inertial Motion Capture System in subjects 20 -40 years 
of age.  
2) To measure pain, anxiety, disability , and cervical s pi[INVESTIGATOR_341826].  
3) To compare compliance of TENS home usage in groups wi th and without short 
message system (SMS), text message, reminders.  
c. Procedures in volved (Research Interventions)  
There wil l be thr ee groups as follows: twenty subjects with no pain in the normal 
group; forty subjects with chronic subclinical neck or upper quad rant pain will be 
randomized into two groups: twenty subjects in the control group, and twenty 
subjects in the interve ntion gr oup. The intervention group will be further randomized 
into two groups: ten subjects will receive instructions for home use of  TEN S with 
daily SMS text message reminders and ten subjects will receive instruc tions for home 
use of TENS without SMS te xt messa ge reminders. We will aim for an equal 
distribution of males and females in each group.  
 
First ses sion (Day  1): Before startin g the procedures, participants complaining of pain 
that are greater than 4/10 in the VAS will be excluded from the study a s this will be 
greater of what we consider to be subclinical pain based on literature review and if 
the pa in has b een present less tha n three months. In addition, if participants with pain 
less than 4/[ADDRESS_423252], participants in the normal group (20 subjects) will first be in structed  to 
complete the VAS  for pain, a subjective measure of pain intensity consisting of a 10 
centimeter ( cm) line with anchor statements on the le ft (no pain) and extreme pain on 
the right. Pain scores will be determined by [CONTACT_341845] “n o 
pain” to the parti cipant’s anchor point.  In this group the score must be “no pain” or 0 
cm.Particip ants randomly assigned to the control g roup (20 subjects) will first be 
instructed to complete the VAS for pain  with a score less than 4/10 requir ed. 
Participants randomly assigned to the intervention group (10 subjects) that will 
receive daily SMS  text me ssage  reminders  for compliance during intervention  will 
first be instructed to complete the VAS for pain  with a score less than 4/10 required.  
Participant s randomly assign ed to the intervention group (10 subjects) that will not 
receive daily SMS text messa ge reminders  for compliance during in tervention will 
first be instructed to complete the VAS for pain  with a score less than 4/10 required.  
Next, all part icipants in all g roups will complete 2 self-report questionnaires 
beginning with  the STAI -form Y which is a definitive clinical m easure of state and 
trait anxiety in adults. Form Y has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state  
anxiety . All items are r ated on a 4 -point scale (e.g., from “Almost Never” to “Almost 
Always”). Higher score s indicate greater anxiety.  
Next, all participants in all groups will complete the NDI questionnaire which 
consist of 10 sections  (pain intensity, personal  care, lifting, w ork, headaches, 
concentration, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], driving, reading and recreation ) with quest ions that are 
measure in a 6 -point sca le from 0 (no disability) to 5 ( full disability ). The numeric 
responses will be added with a score varying fr om 0 -50 where 0 is consid ered “no 
activity limitation” and 50 is considered “complete disability.”  Furthermor e, 0-4 (no 
disability), 5 -14 (mild dis ability), 15 -24 (moderate disability), 25 -34 (severe 
disability) and greater than 35 (complete disability).  
Next, all participants in all groups will be familiarized with the  Noraxon 
myoMotionTM system instrument that utilizes inertial measurement units (I MUs) to 
 
 8 measure angles of motion in joints which will measure c ervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341827] (JPE) t est. 
Participants in the normal group will not receive any interventions  in the lab or at 
home and will not receive  educa tion on the use of TENS equipment.  
Participants in the control  group will not receive any interventions  in the lab or at 
home and will  not receive  education on the use of TENS equipment.  
Participants in the intervention  group  with daily SMS text mes sage reminders  will 
be provided with a TENS  unit by [CONTACT_341846] a total  of [ADDRESS_423253] .  
 
Session 2 (1st follow up)  (Day 8) : Participants  will return on  day eight . Parti cipants in 
the normal group  will be asked to complete  again complete the VAS, STAI, and NDI. 
Also, cervical s pi[INVESTIGATOR_341828].  Partic ipants  will not re ceive any

lab. 
 
Phone/Email follow up :  Participants in the normal , control a nd intervention ( with no 
SMS text message reminders) groups  will be contact[CONTACT_426] e -mail and SMS text 
message during the seventh day  period  at least  one before retu rning for session two 
on the eight  day and at least three times before returning for the  last session on day 
thirty . 
Participants in the interventi on group (with SMS text reminders for compliance) 
will be contact[CONTACT_341847] t ext message  daily for compliance  with high-frequency 
sensory TENS during the seven -day period before session two and dur ing the twenty -
one-day period before last session.  We will send a text message to the personal 
phone . Investigators will be available th rough phone , text message or ema il to answer 
any questions  participants  may have.  
 
Last session  (Day 30) : Participants  will return on d ay thirty. Participants in the  
normal group  will be asked to complete  again complete the VAS, STAI, and NDI.

9. DATA COLLECTION  
The study will be conducted in th e Neuroscience Research Laboratory in the SAHP - 
Room NH A -712, Loma Linda,  [LOCATION_004] . Informed consent will be obtained prior to 
 
 13 the beginning of the study by [CONTACT_341851].  Participants will be recruited if they are adults (males and 
females) aged 20-40 years old with  no pain for the normal group and with neck or 
upper quadrant pain no greater than 4/[ADDRESS_423267] acute pain or contrain dications for TENS.  
Study participants will be assessed on visits one, tw o and three (visit th ree will be at 
the end of the thirty -day period ).  
During participant’s visit one , two and three  the following clinical assessments will 
be provided:  
- The VAS f or pain, a subjective measure of pain intensity  
- The STAI -form Y is a definitive clinical mea sure of state and trait anxiety in adult s. 
- The NDI questionnaire that measures neck disability.  
- JPE test  which will measure cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341837] . 
 
10. LABELING & STORAGE OF DATA & SPECIMENS  
Hard co pi[INVESTIGATOR_91685] a locked file cab inet in a locked room in the clinic and 
computer data will be stored on an encrypted computer in a locked room in the clin ic.  
 
11. DATA ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed using SPSS version [ADDRESS_423268] deviations.  Also, an expert statistician will be consulted to  accurately 
analyze and interpret the results. The alpha level will be set at 0.05.  
 
12. RISK AND INJURY  
Participating in this study will involve the following risks:  this study may involve 
breach of your confidentiality, risk of falls, risk of fatigue during  study procedures 
and discomfort with the application of pain reducing electrical stimulation . This study 
may involve breach of your c onfidentiality : your information will be kept in a locked 
cabinet , in a locked office  and store on a secure drive . Risk of falls: all reasonable 
attempts will be made to p revent you from falling including superv ision, as someone 
will stand closely beside y ou to provide you with physical assistance as needed , the 
floor in the neuro science research laboratory is not slippery. Risk of fatigue during 
 
 14 study procedures: you wil l be offered rest breaks regularly if th e investi gators notice 
signs of fatigue on you.  You will be instructed on the use and application of pain 
reducing electr ical stimulation device.   
 
13. BENEFIT (S) 
We expect that participants will experience improvements  in cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_341838] p ropriocept ion, decreased anxiety and neck disabi lity, and all components 
of improving wholeness and health as participants  carry out functional activities.  The 
expected benefits of this study include the improve of q uality of life and functional 
mobility i n people w ith neck chronic pain. In addition, th e study may provide 
evidence of the efficacious use of electrical stimulat ion as a non -pharmacological 
option for the management of chronic pain. This study is expected  to provide through 
electrical stimulati on an acce ssible, affordable, self -administered and non -
pharmacological option for the management of chronic pain without the need to go to 
a clinic for the application of electrical stimulation.

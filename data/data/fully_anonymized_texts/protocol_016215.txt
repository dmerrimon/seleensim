Document  date: March 27, [ADDRESS_1134609] care because midodrine carries the risk of supi[INVESTIGATOR_142660]. However, in patients without orthostatic hypotension, this adverse reaction is theoretically less 
prevalent due to preserved baroreflex buffering that maintains blood pressure homeostasis.1 Midodrine has several 
uniqu e pharmacological properties compared to other medications in its class: it exerts significantly less 
gastrointestinal effects, has minimal central nervous system side effects, and demonstrates excellent bioavailability 
following oral administration.2 These desirable pharmacological properties lead to midodrine’s potential a pplication 
for new indications.  
One of the most frequently prescribed off -label indications for midodrine is prevention of intradialytic hypotension. 
A systematic review was conducted evaluating the use of midodrine for the prevention of intradialytic hypo tension.3 
56 patients received a one -time dose of 2.5 to 10 mg of midodrine 15 –30 minutes prior to each dialysis ses sion 
compared to a placebo -control group. The  midodrine group’s mean pre - and post - dialysis systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) was 128 .1 (90 .5–138.7) mmHg and 115 .5 (81 .5–129.9) mmHg and pre - and post -dialysis diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) was 72 .4 (55.4–81.4) mmHg and 58 .9 (50 .2–72.5) mmHg . The control group’s mean pre - and post -
dialysis SBP was 123 .2 (73 –135.2) mmHg and 103 .1 (64 .9–116.5) mmHg and pre - and post -dialysis DBP was 58 .1 
(44–76.2) mmHg and 52 .5 (32 .6–66.8) mmHg. The midodrine group demonstrated a statistically significant greater 
post dialysis and nadir SBP with a mean difference of 12 .4 mmHg (7 .1–17.7; p<0.0001) and 13 .3 mmHg (8 .6–18; 
p<0.0001) and post dialysis and nadir DBP with a m ean difference of 7 .3 mmHg (3 .7–10.9; p=0 .0001) and 5 .9 
mmHg (2.7–9.1; p=0 .0004) vs. the placebo control group.[ADDRESS_1134610] of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819266].5 In another study, midodrine was used as an alternative to intravenous 
inotropic thera py in patients with hypotension associated with stunned myocardium. The authors concluded that 
midodrine can shorten the duration of intensive care unit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819267].6 At MGH’s ICUs, 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1134611] an expected statistically significant difference of 6 hours (from initiation of drug  until discontinuation 
of IV vasopressors) between the two group s.  
 
Subjects are being enrol led at: 
1. [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_011] (MGH)  
o Local IRB: Partners Human Research Committee, protocol number:  2016P002045  
2. Sir Charles Gairdner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Australia (SCGH)  
o Local IRB: Sir Charles Gairdner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665639], protocol Number: 2015 -098 
3. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, [LOCATION_011] (BIDMC)  
o Local IRB: Committee on Clinical Investigations, protocol number: 2018P000162  
 
Recruitment  
Subjects will be identified from the ICU census on a daily basis by [CONTACT_113452] d identified by [CONTACT_819276]. If identified subjects meet inclusion/exclusion criteria they will then be approached by a speciali sed 
health care provider. The speciali sed health care provider will be a physician that is part of the clinical staff i n the 
ICU who has first -hand knowledge of the subject’s medical history. This physician will approach potentially eligible 
subjects to introduce them to the resea rch study. If both the specialis ed health care provider approves his or her 
subject to be cont acted for research purposes and the subject agrees to be contact[CONTACT_819277], a study physician will then approach the subject to obtain informed 
consent.

Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained from the participant by a study physician. If the subject lacks mental competency 
based on the mini mental status exam to provide informed consent, the subject’s designated surrogate will be explained 
their responsibility as a LAR to make decisions on the patient’s behalf, and will be asked to provide consent. The LAR 
will also be explained that  should the participant re -gain mental capacity, he/she will be formally consented. As part of 
this, the study physician will address the patient explaining what procedures have been held so far, the purpose, risks 
and benefits of the study. The study phys ician will then explain the patient’s right to decide as to whether they wish to 
continue being a participant in the study. Based on the patient’s decision, study procedures will be continued or 
withheld immediately. The following categories of surrogates (listed in general order of preference) may provide 
consent in writing on behalf of potential subjects incapable of providing informed consent:  
 Health Care Proxy, a court appointed guardian of the person with specific authority to consent to participation 
in the research study, but also next -of-kin in the following order of priority unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_2371]: 
spouse, adult child (18 years of age or older), parent, adult sibling (18 years of age or older), grandparent, or 
adult grandchild (18 years o f age or older).  
Assent of subjects is required for participation in the research unless the subject is incapable of giving assent due to 
his/her medical condition. If the individual objects to participation, s/he will not be enrolled. The Investigator wil l 
document the relationship of the surrogate to the subject in the research record.  
Study Procedures  
Prior to randomis ation, if subjects are eligible based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, informed consent will  be obtained 
from participant s. Once informed consent is obtained, the following information will be  collected from the subject’s 
medical record: demographics, past medical/surgical history, preadmission  medication list, severity of illness at time of 
admission, blood pressure, aspartat e aminotransfer ase, alanin e aminotransferase  creatinine, troponin, cortisol level.   
 
The study drug or placebo will be selected based on the randomi sation scheme and prepared by [CONTACT_819278] s. All study personnel will be blinded, except the investigational  pharmacist, to the treatment group of the 
subject. Subjects will be randomi sed to receive either 20 mg  PO every 8 hours of  midodrine, or placebo PO every 8 
hours . 
 
The study drug will be delivered in a double -blind ed manner until:  
 ICU discharge  
 Rate of phenylephrine exceeds 100 mcg/min , or rate of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_819269] 8 mcg/min , or rate of 
metaraminol exceeds 60mcg/min  
 Subject exhibits signs and symptoms of organ failure or hypoperfusion  
 Serious allergic adverse event related to midodrine  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] r equirement  
 Death  
 
If the blood pressure goal is met for more than 24 hours without IV vasopressors and the attending  physician determines 
that the study drug is no longer required, the study drug may be discontinued  at the discretion of the treating physician .

 Outcomes  
Study endpoints include the following:  
 Primary endpoint :  
o Hours from initiation of midodrine until discontinuation of IV vasopressors  
 Secondary endpoints :  
o ICU length of stay (LOS), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95156], rates of ICU readmission  
 Safety endpoints :  
o hypertension (increase in blood pressure to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 20 percent higher than the 
predefined goal set by [CONTACT_96204]), bradycardia (decrease in heart rate 20 percent lower than the 
prede fined goal set by [CONTACT_96204]), hemodynamically significant tachyarrhythmia (>20 percent 
decrease in systolic blood pressure).  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Our patient population is by [CONTACT_819279].  It is expected that they will have a number of unrelated 
adverse health events (AE) during the course of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  Therefore, we will limit the scope of our AE 
monitoring and recording to the following:  
 Serious Adverse Events, defined as  
o Death, believed to be related to the  study drug, or a death that is unexpected considering the 
acuity of a patient  
o A life -threatening experience believed to be related to the study drug  
o Persistent or significant disability or incapacity that is of greater frequency or severity than 
what woul d be normally expected in the course of critical illness   
o An event that jeopardis es the Human Subject and may require medical or surgical treatment to 
prevent one of the preceding outcomes and is not expected in the course of critical illness  
 Adverse Even ts possibly related to the study procedures are pre-specified in the list below:  
o Hypertension  
o Bradycardia  
o Hemodynamically significant tachyarrhythmia  
o New organ failure  
 
Evidence for adverse events related to midodrine will be assessed until completion o f all study measurements. They 
will also be included in the FDA Annual Progress Report.  
Statistical Analysis  
Please refer to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
We cannot guarantee any personal benefits from participating in this study. However, potential benefits to the 
subject may include shorter duration of receiving IV vasopressors, and shorter length of stay in the ICU and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Earlier discharge from the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819270]. Information gathered from this study will help researchers determine 
if midodrine is safe and effective at decreasing duration of IV vasopressors and shortening ICU length of stay 
without increasing the risk  of ICU readmission or increasing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  
POSSIBLE RISKS AND ANALYSIS OF RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
The very common side effects of midodrine reported in previous studies include pi[INVESTIGATOR_724860] -like reactions, 
paraesthesia, pruritus, and dysuria.  The most common side effects are headache, supi[INVESTIGATOR_142642], flushing, 
rash, nausea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, chills, and pain. Less common side effects comprise sleep disorders, insomnia, 
restlessness, excitability, irritability, and reflex bradycardia. Rare  side effects are tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], abnormal 
hepatic function, raised liver enzymes.  
These reactions rarely resulted in discontinuation of medication. These side effects may make the subject 
uncomfortable but do not pose any immediate harm. The su bject will be assessed daily by [CONTACT_819280]. Other risks that the subject may be exposed to 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1134613] for treating this indication in ICU patients.  
Midodrine is a pregnancy category C medication. Pregnant subjects will be excluded from the study  because the 
exposure risks of midodrine to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_15165]. Women between the ages of 18 –55, who have not 
had a surgical hysterectomy , will only be eligible for inclusion if they have a negative urine pregnancy test. 
Pregnancy testing will not need to be repeated if there is a documented negative urine pregnancy test that was 
obtained within [ADDRESS_1134614]’s mental competency is expected due to presence of sedatives or 
delirium. Therefore, if the subject’s surrogate provides consent, a physician independent of the study will reassess the 
subject’s mental competency using the MMSE once their Richmond A gitation Sedation Score returns to [ADDRESS_1134615].  
Privacy  
The screening of patients, d iscussions with family/proxy/legally authori sed representatives, and the consent process 
will occur in private settings with curtains/doors closed so as to provide privacy and comfort.   
DATA SECURITY  
Data Monitoring  
The following areas will be reviewed by [CONTACT_819281]: study binders, screening log, and 
eligibility adherence, consent forms, data retrieved from each patient during the study, adverse event reports, and 
pharmacy -related study contributions. Monitoring procedures will take place on -site, at close -out. A monitoring report 
will be completed to verify that the monitoring plan was followed. This will be presented to the lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_819271]. This will also be included in the FDA Annual Progress Report to ensure compliance with the 
FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, section 312, subpart D. A Data Safety Monitoring Board  is in place , which 
will review the data collected, as well as adverse event reports an d minor deviations logs . 
Confidentiality and Security  
General Protections : All study staff undergo ongoing training in proper research procedures, Good Clinical Practice, 
and the application of HIPAA privacy laws.  
Data collection:  Case report forms will be completed on site by [CONTACT_38991]. Medical record numbers, 
names, dates or other identifiers will not be entered on REDCap. This platform will be used for storage and 
manipulation of all our de -identified data. For the diffe rent study centres , individual access groups will be formed 
and only the coordinating site will have access to all data.  
Study file storage:  All data obtained with subject ident ifiers will be kept in password -protected computer files 
behind the institutio ns’ firewall. A crosswalk linking patient identifiers to study ID number will be maintained 
indefinitely by [CONTACT_458]. Limited data will be retained on screened patients who do not meet entry 
criteria or who decline to participate. We will  retain only the minimum data required to adequately summari se subject 
selection per CONSORT guidelines  in the study publications. Paper records will be kept in locked filing cabinets  
within locked and secured offices to ensure confidentiality. All paper file contents will be shredded before disposal . 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1134616]’s participation, it is not 
feasible to send subjects follow -up with the published results. The study investigators are concerned that mailing the 
published manuscript and an additional thank -you note years after participation risks violating subject privacy, as 
mailing addresses are increasingly likely to change with passing time.   
 
 
[ADDRESS_1134617] of oral midodrine versus placebo on time to liberation 
from intravenous vasopressors in ICU patients with refractory hypotension. The aim of this study is to assess the 
effects of midodrine treatment in pa tients otherwise ready for discharge from the ICU. The primary hypothesis is 
that midodrine treatment shortens the d uratio n of receiving IV vasopressors compared to placebo.  
Study design  
Prospective multi -centre randomis ed placebo -controlled trial . 
Study p opulation and study sites  
The study will enrol  patients admitted to an intensive care or high -dependency unit (ICU/HDU) and meeting all 
eligibility criteria detailed in the study protocol. Study sites include [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([LOCATION_011], MA, 
[LOCATION_003] ), Sir Charles Gairdner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Perth, Australia), and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ([LOCATION_011], MA, 
[LOCATION_003]).  
Randomis ation  
Patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:[ADDRESS_1134618] will be provided  directly to the research pharmacy, which will be responsible for 
preparing and dispensing the study medications following an active order for study medications.  This includes 
preparation and blinding of the placebo in accordance with the study randomi sation schema.  
Study groups  
1. Midodrine , 20 mg PO every 8 hours  
2. Placebo (matched in appearance), PO every 8 hours  
Outcomes  
 Primary endpoint :  
o Time until discontinuation of IV vasopressors, measured in h ours from initiation of midodrine until 
discontinuation of IV vasopressors  
 Secondary endpoints :  
o Time to ICU discharge readiness, defined as the number of days from study drug initiation to meeting 
discharge criteria  
o ICU length of stay, defined as the number of days in the ICU prior to transfer to the general floo r 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], defined as the total number of days in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819272]  
o Rates of ICU readmission, defined as the number of patients readmitted back to the ICU after prior 
discharge to the general floor  
 Safety en dpoints :  
o Hypertension (increase in blood pressure to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 20 percent higher than the 
predefined goal set by [CONTACT_96204]), bradycardia (decrease in heart rate 20 percent lower than the 
predefined goal set by [CONTACT_96204] ), hemodynamically significant tachyarrhythmia (>20 percent 
decrease in systolic blood pressure).  
 
Data Collection  
Baseline descriptive data collection will occur on day of enrolment and includes age, sex, ethnicity, APACHE II 
score, admission diagnosis, pre-existing co -morbidities (diabetes, coronary artery disease, asthma, peripheral 
vascular disease, renal failure, psychiatric disease, musculoskeletal disease, and others) obtained from the subject, 
the subject’s family, and the subject’s medical chart. Baseline laboratory data will be recorded (h aemoglobin, white 
cell count, alanine aminotransfera se (ALT), international normalis ed ratio (INR), bilirubin, urea, creatinine, 
troponin, lactate). During the study daily SOFA scores, blood pressure goals, total  fluid balances, transfused red 
blood cell units, administered corticosteroids, use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187], vasopressor and study drug start and end 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1134619] review.  
Sample size estimation  
The sample size estimation is informed by [CONTACT_819282].7 In this study, the rates 
of vasopressor administration decreased by 38% from −0 .62 ± 1 .40 mcg/min per hour to −2 .20 ± 2 .45 mcg/min per 
hour after addition of midodrine. Based on a median time of 17 h from midodrine initiation to discontinuation of IV 
vasopressors, the 38% reduction translates to an estimated [ADDRESS_1134620] that a sample size of 50 
subjects per group will provide us with >80% probability (power) to detect a difference of 6 h in the primary 
outcome. Allowing for drop -out, our target sample size is 120.  
Statistical analysis  
The study analysis will be performed on a modified intention -to-treat basis: All patients who were randomi sed and 
received at least [ADDRESS_1134621] deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), depending on variable 
distribu tion. The normality of variable distribution will be assessed by [CONTACT_819283], including 
histograms and boxplots.  Differences in continuous data  between groups will be assessed  using a parametric t -test or 
Mann -Whitney U test, as appropriate . Categorical data will be  presented as frequencies and proportions  and 
analysed  using a Chi-square test. If expected cell counts are small (less than 5), Fisher ’s exact test will be used 
instead.  For all analyses, a two -sided p -value of less than 0 .05 will be considered statistically significant. All 
analyses will be conducted under the supervision of a statistician blinded to intervention group assignment. 
Experienced study staff will perform data analysis in collaboration with biostatisticians using statis tical Stata version 
13 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) or later.  
Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes  
A parametric t -test or Mann -Whitney U test will be used, as appropriate, to determine whether time from initiation 
of midodrine until discontinuation of IV vasopressors, time from ICU  admission to ICU discharge readiness, and 
ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819273].  
A Chi-Square  or Fisher’s exact  test will be used to  test whether rates of ICU readmission and incidence of adverse 
events are different between treatment groups.  
Missing data  
The frequency of missing values for each variable will be collected and reported as necessary. If there are missing 
values for the primary or secondary outcome variables, individual patients will be excluded from the analysis of the 
respective outcome and results will be reported for cases with available outcome information.  
Interim Analyses  
There will be no interim analysis.  
Statist ical Analytical Issues   
Multiple Comparisons : There will be no adjustment for multiple testing. Results of secondary outcomes and post 
hoc analyses will therefore be considered exploratory.    
Post-hoc analyses  
Post-hoc data -driven analyses are allowed a fter the following are undertaken:  
1. Document which analyses were conducted after the results for the primary and secondary outcomes are 
analysed . 
2. Document the  rationale for these analyses.  
3. Pre-specify their interpretation in the context of the primary and secondary results and their impact on the 
overall trial conclusions.

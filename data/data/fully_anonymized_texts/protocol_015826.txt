1.0 Research Design 
 
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims  
The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a usual care (UC) vs. targeted generic print 
(TP) vs. tailored telephone counseling and navigation intervention (TCN) on cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) 
uptake at [ADDRESS_600909] and ovarian cancer (HBOC).  Secondary purposes are: 1) to compare the 
effectiveness of a TP vs. a TCN intervention vs. UC on CGRA uptake at 12 months, after removal of key access 
barriers; 2) to compare uptake of genetic testing for HBOC across the three study arms at 6 and 12 months; 3) to 
compare cognitive (beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge) and affective (distress, stress, fear) intermediate endpoints 
among women in the three study arms and explore potential underlying theoretical mediating and moderating 
mechanisms that will further specify and elucidate significant intervention effects; and 4) to perform an economic 
evaluation alongside this randomized controlled trial to estimate the cost effectiveness of the two interventions 
compared to each other and usual care, for uptake of CGRA services from the societal and payer perspectives.  
 
The New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR) will collaborate with investigators from the state cancer registries 
of Colorado and New Mexico ([CONTACT_468946] = overall Principal Investigator) to identify women recently 
diagnosed with high-risk breast and ovarian cancer. The NJSCR will (a) recruit and consent New Jersey patients 
who are eligible to participate in the study, and (b) securely send contact [CONTACT_468900]-related information to the 
overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_468876].  This application is 
for case ascertainment using the NJCSR. 
 
A. Objectives  
AIM 1: Compare the effectiveness of a TP vs. a TCN intervention vs. UC on CGRA uptake 6 months (primary 
outcome) after the intervention and at 12 months, after removal of key access barriers. 
AIM 2:  Compare uptake of genetic testing for HBOC across the three study arms at 6 and 12 months.  
AIM 3:  Compare cognitive (beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge) and affective (distress, stress, fear) intermediate 
endpoints among women in the three study arms and explore potential underlying theoretical mediating and 
moderating mechanisms that will further specify and elucidate significant intervention effects. 
AIM 4: Perform an economic evaluation alongside this randomized controlled trial to estimate the cost 
effectiveness of the two interventions compared to each other and usual care, for uptake of CGRA services from 
the societal and payer perspectives. This aim provides information about the value of the interventions from both 
societal and payer perspectives, given a cost per effect measure and the uncertainty surrounding the estimate. 
 
B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s)  
Primary Hypothesis: Compared to UC, CGRA (genetic counseling) uptake at 6 months (primary outcome) will be 
highest among women participating in the TCN arm followed by [CONTACT_468901].

A.  Research procedures:   
The NJSCR will conduct patient recruitment following their established Standard Operating Procedures (NJSCR 
Data Repository #Pro20140000992).  
 
Recently diagnosed cases will be identified by [CONTACT_468903] a Certified Tumor Registrar (CTR) 
for study eligibility (Table 1).  We will update address information for the case and the physician of record. Each 
person will be assigned an arbitrary study ID and imported into the study tracking database “CRIMSoN.”  NJSCR 
staff will send a letter to the patient’s diagnosing physician of record to notify the physician that his/her patient 
is eligible for participation in the study.  Physicians are asked to notify NJSCR if the patient should not be contact[CONTACT_468904] (i.e., deceased). Two weeks after the physician letter is mailed, NJSCR staff will send the eligible 
patient a packet of study materials, including: 
 
1. An introductory letter containing a brief description of the study (English or Spanish), a statement of how the 
patient was determined to be eligible for inclusion into the study, a statement of how the patient was identified 
via the NJSCR, and a request for the patient’s participation; 
2. Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (one to sign and return, one to keep) of an “agreement to contact” sheet that contains all aspects of 
informed consent and a location to sign; 
3. An information sheet that contains all aspects of HIPAA; 
4. An NJSCR Study FAQ brochure which aims to answer common questions about the NJSCR and study 
participation; and,

V8 11/6/[ADDRESS_600918] form. 
 
One week (or five business days) after the initial mailing, staff at the NJSCR will conduct six to eight follow-up 
phone calls at varying times of the day and different days of the week with at least one evening call made between 
the hours of 5-8pm and at least one call made on a weekend. Those reached by [CONTACT_468905] a verbal consent to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], which will be recorded in the tracking database. A Spanish-speaking 
NJSCR staff member will contact [CONTACT_468906] a preferred language during patient contact.  
Additional recruitment packets will be mailed upon patient request or if returned for an incorrect address. NJSCR 
will track all contact [CONTACT_468907].   
 
NJSCR contracted with Salt City Research to design a tracking tool for patient contact [CONTACT_315347], particularly mail and 
phone contact, and participant response status.  CRIMSON works with SEER*DMS (NJSCR registry database 
system) and includes modifiable reports and tracking for mode of contact.  Key features of CRIMSON include: (1) 
enhanced report functions and data collection for key recruitment statistics across all studies; (2) enhanced 
interoperability with SEER*DMS to reduce manual entry of data and improve data sharing; (3) improved data 
integrity, quality, consistency, and collection through implementation of validation tools and triggers, elimination 
of data redundancies, and execution of auto-fill and auto-coding of key variables to remove manual entry of data 
whenever possible; and (4) implementation of relational structure of the data system allowing for all studies and 
associated administrative data to be housed within a single data system. 
 
After consent / “Agreement to Participate”, NJSCR staff will transfer data securely for consented individuals to 
the prime site for enrollment and participation in the study.   
 
Briefly, the prime site will randomize the individuals into one of three study arms.  NJSCR will not be involved in 
the intervention.  Women will be randomized to one of three study arms: UC, mailed TP, and TCN delivered by a 
health education specialist. Group assignment will occur at the end of the baseline interview using a 
computerized randomized list. The interventions will take place ideally within 2 weeks but no more than 30 days 
upon completion of the baseline survey. Follow-up surveys will be conducted 1 month (to assess mediation), 6 
months, and 12 months after randomization for the UC arm, and 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after the 
interventions for TP and TCN arms. During the 6 and 12 month surveys, participants will be asked if they’d like to 
participate in future research. All survey questions will be stored in the REDCap database. The [ADDRESS_600919] to uptake of CGRA at 6 months (primary outcome) and [ADDRESS_600920] outcomes at 6 and 12 months.  
 
B. Recruitment in New Jersey will begin in July 2018 once SRB and IRB approvals are received and continue 
through July 2020. The tasks include SRB approval, IRB approval, case identification, “Agreement to Contact”, 
data analysis, and publications.   
Overall Study Timeline for the Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_280267]) once the person is enrolled: 
• The duration of a woman’s participation in the study will be approximately 12-13 months depending on 
study arm. 
• The duration estimated for the investigators to complete the study is approximately 5 years and the 
estimated time needed to complete primary and secondary analyses that address all the study’s aims is about 
18 months.

1.5 Sample Size Justification  
 
The overall study will require a sample size of 642 participants, as shown below in Figure 1,  CONSORT flow 
diagram.  The 642 (214 per arm) high-risk breast and ovarian cancer survivors will be randomized to one of the [ADDRESS_600923] and ovarian cancer survivors to obtain 700 consents, expecting that 50% of identified 
individuals sampled and screened for eligibility will fall under our exclusion criteria or will be ineligible for other 
reasons, 25-28% will consent, and we will retain 80% over the course of the study.  Table [ADDRESS_600924] and response rates113 and these rates are consistent with other 
studies that used similar population-based sampling and recruitment strategies for health promotion intervention 
studies in our region (response rates are typi[INVESTIGATOR_468879]).54,57,109,114-116 Based on our

1.6 Study Variables 
A. Independent Variables, Interventions, or Predictor Variables  
Intervention Arms. Following completion of the baseline survey, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 
study arms: 1) a Usual Care (UC) control arm; 2) a mailed Targeted Print arm (TP); and 3) Tailored Counseling & 
Navigation (TCN) arm. We hypothesize that the TCN intervention will increase CGRA uptake significantly compared 
to UC and the TP intervention.  
Arm 1- Usual Care: A usual care arm is included to assess GGRA uptake in the absence of intervention as well as 
priming from the surveys for the primary outcome analysis.  
Arm 2- Mailed Targeted Print: Participants randomized to this arm will be mailed an educational brochure within 
two weeks of completing the baseline survey. The brochure will be available in English and Spanish. It addresses 
important evidence-based theoretical targets: CGRA guideline (knowledge), threat appraisal (to validate or raise 
risk perceptions, HBOC seriousness), response efficacy (benefits and expectations about CGRA), self-efficacy 
messages (CGRA resources, insurance reimbursement, assistance for those with financial challenges), and possible 
actions to take (make an appointment and discuss with provider). As described in Section D.1, both the targeted 
print and tailored intervention materials (described below) were developed using formative community engaged 
research methods.119 
Arm 3 - Telephone Counseling & Navigation: Within one month of the baseline survey, a bilingual health 
education specialists will conduct a 30-45 minute (depending on participant needs) telephone health education 
and counseling session with women randomized to this arm. The intervention will be offered in English or Spanish, 
depending on the participant’s preference. Because theoretically-based tailored messages are generally more 
effective than generic messages in producing behavioral change,91,120 we will individualize the psycho-education 
and navigation session according to each participant’s perceptions of threat and efficacy as derived from the 
EPPM,41,100 and according to personal factors such as HBOC and CGRA awareness, family history, cultural factors 
(e.g., ethnicity, language preference, familism, fatalism, family history), psychological and logistical concerns, 
knowledge, and barriers to CGRA that arise during the phone call. Prior to the telephone session, participants will 
receive the same brochure that the TP arm receives. After the phone call, participants will receive a tailored follow-
up letter. It will include images tailored to the individual’s age, self-identified ethnicity, and family composition. 
Health education specialists will enter this into the study database using user-friendly study-specific computer 
screens similar to our previous work.41,100 The Michigan Tailoring System (MTS), a publicly available software 
program, will be used to individually tailor messages and images using demographic, clinical and patient-reported 
data (http://chcr.umich.edu/mts/) for the letter. This information will be derived from the cancer registry data 
(age, type of cancer diagnoses) and during the survey or phone call (ethnicity, family history, primary care provider 
(which may be an oncology specialist), threat and efficacy appraisals, concerns (e.g., family member’s risk and/or 
risk of second cancer, family orientation), top two CGRA facilitators/benefits and top two barriers, and action plan.  
Both the health education specialists coaching and tailored letter incorporate evidence-based communication and 
behavior change approaches designed to raise the participant’s perceptions about the threat (to herself and at-
risk family members), arouse emotions and manage fear, enhance positive beliefs about CGRA (response efficacy), 
and increase self-efficacy by [CONTACT_417270], facilitators, and motivation to get CGRA.39,42,51,121-[ADDRESS_600927] will use a MI style to help participants explore their reasons for getting CGRA, resolve 
ambivalence/decisional conflict, and develop their own action plans. The outline of the call is summarized in Table

 Table 3. Overview of TCN Arm  
Step 1: Introduction and Rapport Building.   
Step 2: Address HBOC Threat Perceptions.  To enhance HBOC risk perception, the health education specialist 
elicits the women’s awareness and thoughts about the CGRA referral guidelines and how these guidelines 
apply to them. The health education specialist provides information about the participant’s personal risk for a 
HBOC-related second cancer and acknowledges that male and female blood relatives may be at increased 
cancer risk. Although we anticipate that the vast majority of participants will perceive HBOC as serious, their 
responses will be used to enhance cognitive processing of information.  
Step 3: Address Barriers and Efficacy.  The health education specialist elicits the participant’s response efficacy 
beliefs, including risk management options for HBOC. If desired by [CONTACT_2299], the health education 
specialist describes the CGRA/genetic counseling process; its effectiveness in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_468881]; and addresses questions, concerns or misconceptions about CGRA (e.g., getting CGRA 
does not mean one has to have a genetic test). The health education specialist uses the “Importance” Ruler (1 
- 10 scale) to elicit participant talk around desire and reasons for CGRA. The health education specialist uses 
the “Readiness” Ruler (1 - 10 scale) to elicit participant talk around ability, confidence, and commitment to 
obtain CGRA within the next six months. Throughout the interaction, the health education specialist will utilize 
a series of open-ended questions to elicit and reinforce the participant’s reasons for undergoing CGRA. The 
health education specialist explores factors that the participant believes would increase priority and/or efficacy 
to get a CGRA. The health education specialist also elicits and addresses the participant’s two most important 
barriers to getting CGRA and attempts to resolve during the phone call.  
Step 4: Construct an Action Plan. Using readiness ruler and action planning visual aids, the health education 
specialist prompts the participant to create a personalized action plan. The health education specialist applies 
implementation intention principles by [CONTACT_468908] a plan to obtain a CGRA, to 
determine what her first step will be, as well as when and how she will execute the plan. 
Step 5: Provide Navigation as Needed. To further bolster self-efficacy and behavior change , the  health 
education specialist offers further assistance (navigation) to help the patient overcome barriers and asks 
permission to follow-up with them to provide further help as needed. The dose and follow-up navigation 
activities will be tracked and analyzed as process variables.  
Step 6: Summary, Closing and Follow-up. The health education specialist provides a summary of the 
participant’s self-identified primary reasons for getting CGRA, how to overcome the top two barriers as well as 
the action plan. The health education specialist asks permission to send a letter to the patient’s primary 
provider letting them know that the participant meets the referral criteria for CGRA according to national 
guidelines and a copy of the participant’s tailored letter. For participants who identify barriers, the health 
education specialist delineates the next steps and schedules a time to follow-up with the patient by [CONTACT_648] . A 
computer generated tailored letter will be mailed immediately after the phone session that includes the 
women’s personalized action plan.

B. Dependent Variables or Outcome Measures 
 
a) Primary Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a usual care (UC) vs. targeted generic print (TP) vs. tailored 
telephone counseling and navigation intervention (TCN) on cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) uptake at 
[ADDRESS_600928] and ovarian cancer (HBOC). 
 Primary Endpoint: Medical record verified CGRA uptake at 6 months and at 12 months after removal of 
key access barriers 
 
b) Secondary Objective 1: Compare uptake of genetic testing for HBOC across the three study arms at 6 and 12 
months. 
 Secondary Endpoint 1: Medical record verified genetic testing uptake at 6 and 12 months. 
 
c) Secondary Objective 2: Compare cognitive (beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge) and affective (distress, stress, 
fear) intermediate endpoints among women in the three study arms and explore potential underlying 
theoretical mediating and moderating mechanisms that will further specify and elucidate significant 
intervention effects 
 Secondary Endpoint 2: Measures of cognitive and affective psychological constructs at 1 and 6 months. 
 
d) Secondary Objective 3: Perform an economic evaluation alongside this randomized controlled trial to estimate 
the cost effectiveness of the two interventions compared to each other and usual care, for uptake of CGRA 
services from the societal and payer perspectives. This aim provides information about the value of the 
interventions from both societal and payer perspectives, given a cost per effect measure and the uncertainty 
surrounding the estimate.

Case recruitment using the New Jersey State Cancer Registry will occur at the NJSCR Trenton Office ([ADDRESS_600930], Trenton, NJ) and the New Brunswick office ([ADDRESS_600931], New Brunswick, NJ)  
 
 Procedures For Audio And Visual Recording  
Not applicable 
 
 Person Identifiers 
Staff at the New Jersey State Cancer Registry will identify and contact [CONTACT_468911] (NJSCR Data Repository 
#Pro20140000992). If a woman would like to participate in the research study, she will be required to sign 
an informed consent form / “Agreement to Contact” which will describe all aspects of informed consent, 
contain information about the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and fully describe study participation.  If the woman 
chooses not to participate, she does not have to return the consent form and if she chooses to participate 
she can withdraw at any time.   
 
On the consent form / “Agreement to Contact” a woman can give the NJSCR staff permission to release 
private identifiable information (PII) to the Principal Investigator.  The variables that will be needed are: 
name, all elements of the address at diagnosis and current address, telephone number, demographic 
variables (i.e., gender, race, age, date of birth, etc.) and cancer-related variables (i.e., date of diagnosis, 
cancer type, etc.).  NJSCR will need to provide these variables to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_468885], baseline survey, randomization, and interventions.

will be used for communication between research staff.  Any PII will be transferred in a secure, encrypted 
manner.  All electronic data will be backed up regularly on a secure server.  As aforementioned, the 
biostatisticians who analyze the data will be blinded to participant’s study arm.  Data for this study, 
including P[INVESTIGATOR_51381]I, will be stored by [CONTACT_468912] 6 years after study completion as required by [CONTACT_346125]. 
 
B. Study Instruments 
All recruitment materials, surveys, and intervention materials will be available to participants in English or Spanish, 
depending on their preference. The TCN session will be conducted in English or Spanish, depending on the participant’s 
preference. Spanish materials will be submitted to the IRB after the English materials have been approved. To further 
facilitate communication, Spanish speaking participants and study staff may use over the phone translation services.  
 
There will be 4 surveys over the course of the study period (baseline, 1 m, 6m, 12 m) and will include different components 
as described below.  These are developed at the prime site. 
CGRA Decision and Genetic Test Uptake: Participants who have CGRA within 6 months of the intervention (or baseline 
survey for UC arm) will be considered “completers” of CGRA for the primary outcome. The primary outcome is medical 
record verified CGRA delivered by [CONTACT_941] 6-month follow-up. Those reporting that they had CGRA will be asked to sign a 
medical release form so that we may verify their self-reported CGRA. This approach is extremely feasible and has been 
successful in ours’41,134 and others’135,136 prior work. We will track the type of provider (e.g., physician, genetic counselor, 
etc.) who provided CGRA and document their genetics training via the documentation form. Using the same strategy, we 
will assess CGRA utilization at [ADDRESS_600933] release signed by [CONTACT_1962], self-reported genetic 
testing (including type of test and test result) will also be medical record verified at 6 and 12 months.  
Sociocultural Factors and Cues to Action:  1) Sociodemographics: age, gender, education, household income, financial 
status, marital status, rural-urban community area code,137 living biological children, and health insurance status, country 
of origin, years lived in the U.S; 2) Medical history: personal/family history of cancer, cancer stage, heath status, co-
morbidity index; 3) Acculturation: Short Acculturation Scale;138 4) Family and friends social support and encouragement 
to obtain CGRA;41,139,140 5) Family orientation: The Familism Scale;141 6) Brief Fatalism Scale;142,143 7) Health System 
Distrust;144 8) Receipt of a physician/provider recommendation for CGRA; and 9) Primary health care provider received 
tailored letter in the TPN arm. 
Cognitions/Beliefs : 1) Perceived risk: Distinct items with established predictive validity will assess absolute and 
comparative risk perceptions about risk of carrying a HBOC gene mutation and family members’ risk of HBOC;39,41,54,145,146 
2) Self-efficacy: items assess women’s confidence in their ability to locate CGRA services and obtain such services;39,100 3) 
Response efficacy: beliefs about benefits of CGRA in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_468886], managing personal cancer risks, providing 
important information for family, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_468887], and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_468888]; 42,126 4) 
Subjective Numeracy: validated items from the Subjective Numeracy Scale to assess self-reported numeracy skills;147,148 
5) Genetic Self Efficacy: items assess women’s confidence in their ability to understand genetic information and how it 
applies to their own health;149-151 6) Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) Law Confidence: belief that the 
GINA law would adequately protect against genetic based discrimination;152 7) Decisional conflict associated with the 
CGRA and gene test decisions will be measured with the SURE Scale;153,154 8) Decisional satisfaction about CGRA and gene 
test decisions will be measured with a 4-item scale155-157 and 3 additional items that assess how they feel about their

CGRA/testing decision in relation to their family; 9) Decision Regret Scale will assess regret related to their decision to 
have or not have CGRA;54,158 and 10) Several items will assess CGRA and testing intentions.126 
Knowledge: Items from the National Center for Human Genome Research Knowledge Scale and additional items specific 
to breast and ovarian cancer survivors and misconceptions concerning CGRA and genetic testing will be used.159,[ADDRESS_600934] about or were referred for CGRA and HBOC genetic testing (e.g., BRCA1/2) prior to 
being contact[CONTACT_387415]. 
Facilitators and Barriers Regarding CGRA : Items will be drawn from prior research, including our own work.39,42,122,126 
Barriers at the individual, interpersonal, structural, and system-level will be assessed.39,42,122 Facilitators include but are 
not limited to: help from family, desire to reduce risk, and referrals from medical professionals.  We will also document 
the most important barriers and facilitators.  
Health Literacy: Psychometrically validated items161,[ADDRESS_600935] of Functional Health Literacy in Adults. 
Emotions:  1) Fear of HBOC risk (self, family): Affect in Risk Scale;145,163,164 2) Cancer Worry Scale; 165,166 3) Psychological 
distress: anxiety and depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory,167-169 Short Perceived Stress Scale;170,171 4) 
Defensive Avoidance172,173 
CGRA Mode Preferences:  At the 6-month follow-up, we will elicit their preferred mode of CGRA delivery (telephone, 
internet (Skype), or in-person) and reason for this preference. 
Reactance to Intervention Materials:   At the 1-month survey, participants will be asked if they received and read the print 
intervention materials (e.g., brochure, tailored letter, reminder action plan) and had telephone coaching.53 For those who 
respond “yes,” 53,174-176 open-ended questions will also be included regarding what participants liked and did not like about 
the materials. 
Future Research: At the [ADDRESS_600936] Data Collection:  For the economic assessment, we will collect data on: 1) cost of print materials and mailings; 2) 
health education specialist time to deliver the intervention and follow-up navigation; 3) participant out-of-pocket and 
time costs; 4) costs associated with the CGRA and genetic test (BRCA1/[ADDRESS_600937]); and 5) overhead related to 
the intervention (space, etc.). Time will be valued at US wages rates using data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.177 
Some costs will obviously differ by [CONTACT_30157] (e.g., telephone/internet charges and time), but other differences may be 
less obvious. Since we are interested in future replication costs, we will focus on intervention delivery costs, including 
events and health care use.  Briefly, health education specialists will record time and resources used delivering the 
interventions on participant encounter forms; these forms will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_468889]. Participants will asked 
questions regarding how much time they spent, how much childcare they paid for, and how many miles they traveled for 
each preventive measure, cancer genetic risk assessment, or genetic test they report getting. We have successfully used 
these methods previously.54,178,179

2.2 Resources Available  
 
A. Facilities  
Cancer cases diagnosed in New Jersey will be obtained from the New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR), located 
within the Cancer Epi[INVESTIGATOR_468875] (CES) program at the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH). The 
NJSCR is managed and supported by [CONTACT_468921] (CINJ) through a Memorandum of 
Agreement between the NJ Department of Health and Rutgers, The State University of NJ. NJSCR receives funding 
from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control, and other state and federal programs.  The 
NJSCR is a population-based cancer registry dedicated to tracking the occurrence of cancer in the state of New 
Jersey since 1978. The NJSCR contains information on all cancer cases including the type of cancer, race, gender, 
age residence at diagnosis, first course of treatment, and survival and, has received recognition for its high quality 
and timely data. The CRP collaborates on and conducts cancer research studies, publishes findings in scientific 
journals, analyzes data from the NJSCR and produces statewide cancer incidence, mortality and other specialty 
reports that inform cancer prevention and control efforts. 
 
The NJSCR employs a full complement of experienced cancer registration, research, and information systems 
personnel to successfully meet its goals for statewide cancer surveillance and research support. Research and data 
use are primarily managed and conducted by [CONTACT_468922] 
(CSRP), under the leadership of the Director ([CONTACT_468948]) and Deputy Director ([CONTACT_468947]). The senior Research 
Scientists manage several research studies and participate in cancer control and prevention initiatives using NJSCR 
data. Investigators are required to work collaboratively with CSRP staff when developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a research protocol using 
NJSCR data. Staff members at NJSCR and CSRP are well trained in cancer registration and surveillance research

A. Recruitment Details – New Jersey State Cancer Registry – Cancer Surveillance Research Program (NJSCR-CSRP)  
Subjects are recruited through contact [CONTACT_468924]-CSRP, following their established Standard Operating 
Procedures (NJSCR Data Repository #Pro20140000992).  
 
Recently diagnosed cases will be identified by [CONTACT_468903] a Certified Tumor Registrar (CTR) 
for study eligibility (Table 1).  We will update address information for the case and the physician of record. Each 
person will be assigned an arbitrary study ID and imported into the study tracking database “CRIMSoN.”  NJSCR 
staff will send a letter to the patient’s diagnosing physician of record to notify the physician that his/her patient 
is eligible for participation in the study.  Physicians are asked to notify NJSCR if the patient should not be contact[CONTACT_468904] (i.e., deceased). Two weeks after the physician letter is mailed, NJSCR staff will send the eligible 
patient a packet of study materials. 
 
One week (or five business days) after the initial mailing, staff at the NJSCR will conduct six to eight follow-up 
phone calls at varying times of the day and different days of the week with at least one evening call made between 
the hours of 5-8pm and at least one call made on a weekend. Those reached by [CONTACT_468905] a verbal consent to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], which will be recorded in the tracking database. A Spanish-speaking 
NJSCR staff member will contact [CONTACT_468906] a preferred language during patient contact.  
Additional recruitment packets will be mailed upon patient request or if returned for an incorrect address. NJSCR 
will track all contact [CONTACT_468907].

Protocol Title: GRACE Project 
V8 11/6/[ADDRESS_600962] risk in the study is the loss of privacy. This is minimized using de-identified data (see 
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects below). 
 
 Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) –  
To help us protect privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes 
of Health. The researchers can use this Certificate to legally refuse to disclose information that may 
identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, 
for example, if there is a court subpoena. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands 
for identifying information.  The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from 
personnel of the [LOCATION_002] Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded 
projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Certificate of Confidentiality will not be used to prevent disclosure 
to state or local authorities of harm to self or others.  
 
 Potential Benefits to Subjects 
Although the risks to participants are minimal, the personal and familial benefits are that all participants 
will be provided with education via print material and those in the TPN arm, will receive behavior change 
counseling and patient navigation. At 6-months, the study will offer to cover the costs of CGRA for all 
enrolled women across all study arms, should they desire these services. 
 
 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
The NJSCR has established policies and procedures governing the use of cancer surveillance data for 
research including physical access controls, data access controls, and confidentiality and CITI training. On 
occasion, a cancer patient that has been contact[CONTACT_468932]/her cancer diagnosis information being included in the 
statewide cancer registry. All NJSCR staff are trained in the proper procedures to discuss the state-
mandated collection of cancer diagnosis information. If the cancer patient expresses discontent over 
being contact[CONTACT_468933], the NJSCR staff member will offer the option for the 
patient to be placed on a “Do Not Contact [CONTACT_468934]” list. The patient will no longer be contact[CONTACT_468935].

6.0 Research Data Protection and Reporting 
 
6.1 Data Management and Confidentiality 
A. Data Analysis Plan 
Participants will be randomized into the 3 arms using block randomization. Analyses will be conducted with SAS 
9.4 and R 3.2 or updated versions. Outcome variables, along with baseline and follow-up (as applicable) 
demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors described above, will be summarized by [CONTACT_468937] (standard deviations) for continuous variables and tabulations for categorical 
variables. Although we do not anticipate baseline differences in the distribution of measured factors between the 
randomly assigned arms, we will assess for statistical differences using appropriate parametric and non-
parametric tests. While the specific aims along with the analyses are described below, some of the analytical 
strategies across the aims are described as follows: 1) The key study outcomes will be reported that account for 
missing data using multiple imputation and intent-to-treat (ITT) approaches.  Multiple imputation under the 
Missing at Random assumption will be applied using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method186 via PROC MI in SAS, 
given the expected pattern of non-monotonic missing data. A post hoc approach will address the influence of 
missing not at random (MNAR) and the effect of attrition on outcomes of interest. Sensitivity analyses will be 
performed to assess alternative multiple imputation techniques upon the extent of MNAR influences. 2) 
Multiplicity  will be adjusted for the primary outcome analysis using the Holm’s adjustment procedure, which 
guarantees strong error control.[ADDRESS_600966] sizes and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) of all outcomes using both ITT, per protocol, and multiple imputed data will be reported 
regardless of statistical significances.  
 
Analytic Plan for Addressing Specific Aims: Aim [ADDRESS_600967] among women participating in the TCN 
arm followed by [CONTACT_468901]. The proportion and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of CGRA 
uptake for each arm will be calculated using Wilson score interval or the exact binomial CI of Clopper and Pearson 
method, depending on the data skewness or sample sizes at each time and ethnic and geographic subgroups. For 
the primary outcome analysis, logistic regression modeling will be employed with the main covariate of arm to 
estimate an odds ratio (OR) along with a 95% CI. As needed, we will report an adjusted OR, controlling for 
confounding factors. Potential confounds include age in years, cancer diagnosis site (breast, ovarian or both), 
family cancer history (yes vs. no), at-risk first-degree relatives (yes vs. no), education level (< high school, high 
school diploma, >= college), household income (low: below the median income vs. high or as appropriate), time 
since diagnosis (<5 years, 6-10 years, > 10 years), health insurance (yes vs. no), geographic residence (rural vs. 
urban), state (NM vs. CO), health literacy (continuous or categorical levels), ethnicity (Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic), 
primary language (English vs. Spanish); other psychological, sociocultural and demographic factors will be adjusted 
as needed. We will also compare the [ADDRESS_600968] verified CGRA uptake by 12 
months (secondary outcome) after offering to cover the costs of CGRA following the 6-month survey for those 
 
 
 
Protocol Number: [PHONE_9807] 
PI [CONTACT_5627]: Kinney 
Protocol Title: GRACE Project 
V8 11/6/[ADDRESS_600969] will be assessed by [CONTACT_468938] (UC to TP/TCN; TP to TCN). For those that 
availed themselves of “free” CGRA provided through the study, we will describe patient preferences by [CONTACT_468939] (e.g., age, ethnicity, residence area, education, income, literacy, psychosocial factors, and 
language preference). Model selection with multiple variables will be conducted using AIC and BIC approximation 
criteria, while including theoretically and practically relevant variables. Aim [ADDRESS_600970] to uptake of genetic testing for HBOC at 6 and 12 months. Similar to Aim 1, 
multivariable regression modeling approach will be performed for the binary outcome (genetic testing yes vs. no) 
with the main covariate of arm and other confounding variables at each time point. Then, generalized linear mixed 
effects model (GLMM) will be employed for the two time point outcomes, using binomial distribution with logit 
link function and adjusting for the correlation within the same subjects to estimate the behavior trend over time. 
Aim [ADDRESS_600971] to beliefs (threat and efficacy), informed decision making indicators (knowledge, decisional 
conflict, and decision regret) and emotional factors (cancer worry and fear). Arm comparisons will be based on 
differences in least-square mean changes from baseline to 6 months (including values from the 1-month survey) 
from an analysis of covariance model containing terms for study arm with baseline scores for as a covariate. 
Structural equation modeling (SEM) for the hypothesized meditational pathways will be conducted with the 
procedure of CALIS in SAS and the ‘sem’ package in R. Before the SEM, all variables in the modeling will be centered 
with means zero. The SEM will focus on (1) specifying structural equation models; (2) interpreting the model fit 
statistics and estimation results; (3) testing model with the arms; and (4) analyzing direct and indirect effects. 
Mediators of intervention effects include threat appraisals, response efficacy, self-efficacy, knowledge, 
recommendation about CGRA measured at one-month post intervention. Several indices will be used to assess 
the adequacy of overall model fit: Comparative Fit Index, Standardized Root Mean-Square Residual, and Root-
mean Square Error-of Approximation.188 The interventions may not be beneficial for all study participants. Thus, 
sensitivity/moderation analysis will be done to identify subgroups for which the intervention has or does not have 
an effect (e.g., age, diagnosis, time since diagnosis, rural/urban, education level, literacy, acculturation, language 
preference, close at-risk relative, household income, familism, family support of CGRA, provider recommendation, 
and cost, travel and time barriers). This will provide important information about subgroups who are particularly 
receptive or resistant to the effect of each intervention.  
Economic Analysis:  Aim [ADDRESS_600972] of implementing the interventions from a payer and 
societal perspective. The payer in this case would be the entity responsible for funding the cancer registry 
considering patient ascertainment and intervention implementation; therefore, we will estimate recruitment 
costs, intervention development and delivery costs and downstream costs up to 1-year post intervention. The 
societal perspective in theory includes all goods and services consumed as a result of the intervention, including 
the payer costs and patient costs: deductibles, copayments, and cost-sharing for direct medical goods and services 
in addition to direct non-medical goods and services such as transportation to appointments, and indirect, or 
opportunity costs incurred as part of the intervention.[ADDRESS_600973] research on the costs of 
behavioral interventions.54,178,179 Implementation costs will include labor (e.g., registry and study staff, MI trainer, 
health education specialists) and non-labor (e.g., printing, mailing, costs of CGRA and genetic tests, telephone

charges, patient-related travel time). Costs will be grouped as variable and fixed costs. We focus on costs of 
replicating delivery of the intervention and the immediate down-stream consequences (e.g., obtaining CGRA and 
genetic testing). Costs will be estimated via direct elicitation from participants and medical records to assign fixed 
price weights. We consider the following outcomes based on a priori trial specifications: 1) average cost per 
patient for ascertainment, scheduling, health education specialist-participant interaction time; 2) average cost per 
CGRA and genetic testing; and 3) average time spent with health education specialist. We will also examine overall 
health care use (including, visits to genetic professionals and other providers, and genetic testing) by [CONTACT_30157] 
(and covariates as needed) at [ADDRESS_600974]-effectiveness of one method over 
another is derived from using the following formula: Incremental cost-effectiveness A = (CA – CB )/(EA –EB) where CA 
and CB refer to average total costs of each alternative and E A and E B refer to average total effectiveness for each 
alternative. The resulting incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated for each combination of 
comparators, TCN, TP, and UC, can be used to assess the value provided by [CONTACT_124774] A when compared to 
alternative B, as it represents the investment required for each additional unit of effect gained. All analyses of 
cost and effectiveness will be completed on an intent-to-treat basis. Uncertainty in estimates will be tested using 
probabilistic modeling and sensitivity analysis to assess key drivers of results such as rural/urban residence, cancer 
type, ethnicity, language preference, age, education, household income and family composition (have at least one 
living at risk first-degree relative).[ADDRESS_600975]-effectiveness 
acceptability curve plots.192 
Additional analysis:  We will apply the RE-AIM framework to assess reach and effectiveness, implementation and 
adoption issues overall and by [CONTACT_468940], as well as socioeconomic status and cultural 
variables (e.g., language, medical mistrust).193-195 We will describe adherence to the theoretical aspects of the 
intervention and brief MI using MITI global scores.133 We will also explore whether process variables (dose and 
timing of health education specialist-participant interactions, intervention fidelity and intervention reactance 
measures) influence CGRA uptake at [ADDRESS_600976] learning needs and challenges related to counseling and navigation. Content 
and thematic analysis will be employed to evaluate responses to open-ended questions about barriers and 
facilitators to CGRA and genetic testing, preferences regarding CGRA and perceptions about the interventions and 
overall study experience.196 Two coders (AK & KF) code data and inter-rater reliability will be reported.  
B. Power Analysis 
The sample size and power evaluation for the proposed study was based on the primary outcome analysis. Given 
the study’s hypothesis that the TCN intervention will have greater effects over both the UC and TP arm, we believe 
a minimum 12% difference on CGRA uptake [ADDRESS_600977] no greater than 7% CGRA uptake by [ADDRESS_600978] 12% 
increments for TP and TCN, respectively. With the adjusted significance level of 0.017 (alpha) for the multiple 
comparisons using  
Holm’s correction, 182 participants per study arm will provide 95.7% power to detect a 15% difference in the 
CGRA uptake 6 months between the UC and TP arms. For the comparison between TP and TCN, 182 patients per 
arm will provide 84.5% power to detect a 15% difference (19% vs. 34%) at the adjusted 0.[ADDRESS_600979] 80% power to assess the 
interventions’ effects on ~10-12% change to 15% differences in genetic testing uptake, and small to medium effect 
sizes of psychosocial targets between the study arms given the measures’ standard deviations since our final

sample size per arm of 182 exceeds the planned final sample size of 164. Randomizing 548 participants based on 
1:1:1 relative sizes ensures > 80% power for all contrasts. Assuming up to 20% attrition after baseline assessment, 
we will recruit 182 individuals for each arm. The sample size and power was evaluated using PASS13 software.198   
A total of 548 individuals will be required (182 per arm x 3 arms).  NJSCR will recruit [ADDRESS_600980] personal identifiers, each woman will be 
assigned an arbitrary identification number and this will be used for communication between research staff.

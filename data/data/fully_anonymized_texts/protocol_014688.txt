PRÉCIS 
Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is an op tion to treat mitral valve failure when no surgical 
options exist.  In as many as half of patients, TMVR  can cause life-threatening blockage of the left ventri-
cle by [CONTACT_620653].  For these patient’s the only options appear to avoid 
TMVR or in some to cause a focused heart attack and to wait [ADDRESS_826019] obstruction (LAMPOON).  Although there are no dedicated TMVR devices com-mercially available, there has been short-term succes s with implanted transcatheter aortic valve devices 
in the mitral position for TMVR. 
The purpose of this study is to perform LAMPOON and TMVR in patients who have no good options to 
treat their mitral valve failure, using heart valve device s designed to implant in th e aortic valve position.

1.0 Protocol Summary 
Title: NHLBI LAMPOON Study: Intentional lace ration of the anterior mitral leaflet 
to prevent left ventricular outflow trac t obstruction during transcatheter mi-
tral valve implantation 
Précis: Transcatheter mitral valve replac ement (TMVR) can cause life-threatening 
complications such as left ventri cular outflow tract obstruction and 
transcatheter heart valve dysfunction, in cases of extreme septal displace-
ment of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (AML). 
LAMPOON is a new catheter technique to split the AML and prevent iatro-
genic left ventricular outflow tract obst ruction immediately before TMVR.  It 
mimics surgical chord-sparing AML resect ion. It has been used successfully 
in a small number of patients  
Hypothesis: LAMPOON enables transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVR) without 
life-threatening left ventricular outflo w obstruction or transcatheter heart 
valve dysfunction 
Objectives: 
 Technical success (defined below) of LAMPOON-TMVR 
Safety (Freedom from MACE to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5514] 30days) of LAM-
POON-TMVR  
Safety Endpoints Survival to discharge 
Survival to 30days Freedom from MACE (according to MVARC)
 
Feasibility Endpoints Procedure technical success  (TMVR with successful  LAMPOON, without re-
quiring bailout cardiac surgery or bailout septal reduction)

who require transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMV R) for native mitral valve failure, but who are at 
risk of left ventricular outflo w tract (LVOT) obstruction.  
In this protocol, we use a transcatheter heart valve (THV), marketed for implantation in the aortic or pul-
monic positions, off-label.  The THV device is the Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] 3 marketed by [CONTACT_50344]. 
It is important to discriminate the principal research  objective, which is evaluation of the LAMPOON tech-
nique, from the off-label use of the significant risk medical device, th e Edwards Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] 3 THV, which is 
used in the clinical TMVR procedure. 
3.0 BACKGROUND 
The anterior mitral valve leaflet (AML) is a mobile structure that 
physically separates inflow and outflow zones of the left ventricle 
1.  Preserving the anterior mitral  leaflet during surgical mitral 
valve replacement can cause LVOT obstruction, either when the 
prosthesis struts protrude into the LVOT or when a long redun-dant anterior leaflet prolapses into the LVOT 
2, 3.   In a similar 
manner, implantation of a transc atheter heart valve (THV) inside 
the native or repaired mitral valv e enforces an “open position” of 
the anterior mitral valve leaflet that may encroach on the left ventricular outflow tract 
4-7.  This septal displacement of the AML 
is exaggerated when the aortic and mitral annular planes are acutely angulated rather than para llel, when the interventricular 
septum bulges towards the LVOT, when the AML is elongated, 
and when the implant extends or flares into the left ventricle.  In 
this setting TMVR may cause lif e-threatening LVOT obstruction 
[Figure].  Moreover, after TMVR an excessively long AML may prolapse anteriorly into a narrowed LVOT as in hypertrophic car-diomyopathy, or it can prolapse posteriorly and interfere with bi-oprosthetic heart valve opening or closing by [CONTACT_620658]-noulli effects after surgical 
[ADDRESS_826024] AML in an ongoing clinical investiga-
tion [Mayra Guerrero personal communication, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]], 
are excluded because of the perceived risk of life-threatening LVOT obstruction.   
One approach to prevent or treat TMVR-related LVOT  obstruction is pre-emptive transcoronary alcohol 
septal ablation 
10, 11, which sacrifices myocardium, risks conduction system injury and pacemaker-depend-
ence in patients with cardiomyopathy , which is unsuitable in patients wi th thin interventricular septa, and 
which delays TMVR by 4-[ADDRESS_826025] to TMVR, and described its preclini-
cal use 15.  This technique resembles Tirone David’s surg ical anterior resection with chordal sparing 16 
which has become widely adopted as a method of surg ical mitral valve replacement. We create a longitu-
dinal split of the middle scallop (A2) of the AML, im mediately before TMVR.  As a result, chordal attach-
ments displace the split AML away fr om the LVOT after the cylindrical THV is implanted, and blood flows 
unobstructed across the THV stent struts [Figure 1]. 
We recently reported the initial human experience with  this intentional Laceration of the Anterior Mitral 
leaflet to Prevent left ventricular Outflow tract Obstruction (LAMPOON) procedure 17.  Five patients with 
prohibitive risk of LVOT obstruction or transcatheter heart valve (THV) dysfunction from TMVR success-fully underwent LAMPOON, with longit udinal splitting of the A2 scallop of the AML, prior to valve implan-
tation. Multiplane CT modelling predicted hemodynamic collapse assuming an intact AML.  However, criti-
cal LVOT gradients were not seen following LAMP OON and TMVR. Doppler blood flow was seen across 
THV struts that encroached the LVOT, because the AML was split. Transcatheter heart valve function was 
unimpeded. We concluded that this novel catheter technique, which resemble s surgical chord-sparing 
AML resection, may enable TMVR in patients with prohib itive risk of LVOT obstruction or THV dysfunction.  
Recently there have been reports of late transcatheter heart valve thrombotic dysfunction
18.  This war-
rants further investigation using follow-up imaging. 
Since preparation of the clinical manuscript, there have been four patients who underwent clinical non-
research TMVR with LAMPOON at Emory and Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], respectively.  Three of four were tech-
nically successful, and two of four were clinically successful. One patient underwent concurrent transca-
rotid TAVR and LAMPOON TMVR, and unfortunately suffered dislocation of the TMVR device, causing fa-
tal mitral regurgitation and heart failure, before it could be flared on the ventricular aspect by [CONTACT_447]-dilata-
tion after delivery.  This classifies as technically unsuccessful because the TMVR device was not correctly 
positioned. One patient with extreme comorbidity underwent technically successful LAMPOON TMVR but 
suffered a cardiac arrest overnight afterwards.  This additional clinical experi ence teaches that LAMPOON 
TMVR should not be combined with other intended valve procedures such as TAVR during the same pro-cedure, and that technically successful LAMPOON TMVR may nevertheless prove fatal in patients with ex-treme comorbidity.  
5.[ADDRESS_826026] no good alternative treatment options.  They are not eligible 
for definitive treatment using surgical mitral valve repair or replacement.  They are not eligible for TMVR using off-label THV devices because of the risk of LVOT obstruction.  They are not deemed suitable for an alternative investigational preemptive treatment th rough transcoronary alcohol septal ablation/infarc-
tion/debulking because of anatomic limitations and/ or the attendant hazard and myocardial injury and 
requisite 4-6 weeks delay in highly symptomatic patients.

IDE LAMPOON Page 14 of 43 2020-08-24 The procedure is performed under general anesthesia or  under moderate sedation at the discretion of the 
institutional heart team.   The LAMPOON procedure has three steps: (1) leaflet traversal with a guidewire, 
followed by (2) leaflet laceration, immediately followed  by (3) TMVR.  These are all guided by [CONTACT_620659]. 
First catheter access is obtained typi[INVESTIGATOR_620635] e transfemoral arterial (two for LAMPOON and one for 
LV hemodynamics and angiography) and two transfemoral venous introducers sheaths (one for TMVR and another for temporary transvenous pacing).  After anticoagulation with heparin or equivalent to achieve an activated clotting time > 300s, transvenous atrial transseptal puncture is performed under echocardio-graphic guidance.  Atrial septostomy is performed, and a percutaneous transapi[INVESTIGATOR_620636].   
Hemodynamic and echocardiography measurements are recorded at baseline including gradients across 
the mitral and aortic valves and LVOT, and severity of valvular regurgitation. 
Two retrograde catheters are positioned, using a guidewire rail with the antegrade transseptal catheter as 
needed, in the LVOT and LA respectively.  Catheter and echocardiographic maneuvers are performed at 
operator discretion to assure traversal of the major or ifice of the mitral valve.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], these maneuvers 
include advancement of a large-volume inflated balloon tip catheter from the LA to the LVOT under angio-graphic and echocardiographic guidance to assure no en trapment. Next a snare catheter is positioned in 
the mitral inflow via the LA catheter.  An insulated tr anscatheter electrosurgery catheter system (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 
a rigid 0.014” guidewire inside a polymer jacket wire convertor) is positioned against the anterior mitral 
leaflet target at the A2 scallop, using fluoroscopic  and echocardiographic guidance.  Nonionic conductive 
flush (dextrose 5%) can be administered as needed via the guiding catheters to reduce guidewire char and thromboembolism. 
Traversal is accomplished by [CONTACT_522909] 0.014” guide-
wire to an electrosurgery pencil during short bursts of “pure, cutting” radiofrequency energy at approxi-
mately 50W.  The guidewire is repositioned as needed  until it crosses the mitral leaflet and is snare-re-
trieved. 
Next the polymer jacket wire convertor is withdrawn, and the traversal wire is modified at the bedside by 
[CONTACT_522910] (1) denuding a non-circumferential segment ~2mm in length, 90
o arc and (2) kinking the 
denuded segment to enforce its position at the inner curvature of the intended guidewire lacerating sur-face.  Next the polymer jacket radiopaque marker tip is locked adjacent to the kinked denuded shaft seg-ment.  Next the ensnared guidewire is externalized to position the la cerating surface across the base of 
the leaflet. 
Next, at operator discretion, the transcatheter heart va lve may be positioned in the left atrium or across 
the mitral valve before or after the laceration step.  If before, the operator assures no entrapment of the TMVR system with the laceration system of catheters. 
Laceration is performed by [CONTACT_620660], while simultaneously apply electrosurgery energy in short bursts, until the laceration is co mplete and the guidewire is free. 
Hemodynamics are recorded quickly after laceration before TMVR.  Then TMVR is performed using estab-
lished techniques

7.0 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT 
7.1 Inclusion Criteria  
• ĚƵůƚƐĂŐĞшϮϭǇĞĂƌƐ  
• Severe symptomatic native mitral valve failure after mitral annuloplasty repair or related to mitral 
annular calcification. 
• Unacceptably high or prohibitive risk for surgical mitral valve replacement and indicated for 
transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) as  determined by [CONTACT_620654]-
tional heart team, including at least one cardiovascular surgeon who has examined the patient 
• High or prohibitive risk of LVOT obstru ction (predicted neo-LVOT less than 200 mm2) or transcath-
eter heart valve dysfunction from long/redundant anterior mitral valve leaflet, as determined by [CONTACT_620665].   
• Anatomic eligibility for LAMPOON based on core lab assessment of the baseline CT and echocardi-
ogram. 
• Concordance of the study selection team 
7.2 Exclusion criteria 
• Subjects unable to consent to participate, unless the subject has a legally authorized representa-
tive  
• Subjects unwilling to particip ate or unwilling to return for study follow-up activities.  
• Predicted neo-LVOT created by [CONTACT_620655][INVESTIGATOR_109685] 3 skirt, after LAMPOON, less than 150 mm
2 
 
IDE LAMPOON Page 20 of 43 2020-08-24 • TAVR within 6 weeks 
• Intended concurrent structural heart procedure, such as aortic or tricuspid valve implantation 
• Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant prior to completion of all protocol follow-up procedures 
7.3 Rationale for selection criteria 
The selection criteria allow enrollment of the intend ed population with little anticipated selection bias. 
Instead of functional or geometric selection criteria , the study will enroll all subjects deemed otherwise 
suitable for TMVR yet at risk of the problem to be addressed by [CONTACT_620666], the investigational procedure. Planned concurrent valve procedures such as TAVR are disallowed based on a recent fatal adverse event 
described in section 4.0. 
In Amendment C, an additional exclusion criterion was added. This considers whether the fabric-covered 
“skirt” of the Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] [ADDRESS_826031] an obstructive “skirt neo-LVOT” are ex-
cluded.  This amendment also formalizes a threshold neo-LVOT for selection. 
The inclusive selection criteria and geographic extent of enrolling sites are expected to allow recruitment 
of a diverse economic, ethnic, and racial mix of patients that reflects the incident disease.  Specifically, the 
results are expected to be generalizable to Medicare  and Medicaid beneficiaries because of age and dis-
ease-related disability.

study candidates fail screening because of predicted LVOT obstruction [Mayra Guerrero, MD, Personal Communication, October [2016].  [CONTACT_620678] will re commend referring physicians  refer to sites partici-
pating in this study. 
During the early clinical development of the LAMPOON procedure, [ADDRESS_826033] the recruitment objectives will be met. 
 
9.0 SAMPLE COLLECTION, STORAGE AND TRACKING PLAN

10.2 Study Analysis 
Clinical events are classified by [CONTACT_3433] e local site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_620641]-
gator.   The results of the study will be re leased within 12 months of study completion. 
Analyses will be stratified according to the setting for TMVR, whether valve-in-r ing, valve-in-band, or 
valve-in-MAC. 
The study will be analyzed using desc riptive statistics, including a case-by-case narrative summary of ma-
jor adverse events.  Afterwards, we will survey for para meters associated with an  increased risk of major 
adverse events. 
Primary and secondary endpoints will also be analyzed separately among patients with- and without- mi-
tral annular calcification as the primary indication for TMVR. 
10.2.1  Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint is Technical success ACCEPTABLE  (measured at exit from the catheterization labor-
atory)19.  All of the following  must be present: 
- Successful LAMPOON traversal and laceration; and 
- Peak LVOT gradient < 50 mm Hg; and 
- Absence of procedural mortality; and 
- Successful access, delivery, and retrieva l of the LAMPOON device system; and 
- Successful deployment and correct positioning of the first intended device; and 
- Freedom from emergency surgery or reintervention related to the device or access procedure. 
The first two factors are modifications of the MVARC (mitral valve academic research consortium) consen-
sus endpoint19, specific for LAMPOON procedure. 
10.2.2  Co-Primary endpoint 
Based on feedback from the FDA, the co-primary endpoint is Technical Success  OPTIMAL  (measured at 
exit from the catheterization laboratory).  This differs from “Technical Success ACCEPTABLE” only in the 
magnitude of the peak LVOT gradient.   
All of the following must be present: 
- Successful LAMPOON traversal and laceration; and 
- Peak LVOT gradient < 30 mm Hg; and 
- Absence of procedural mortality; and 
- Successful access, delivery, and retrieval of the LAMPOON device system; and 
 
IDE LAMPOON Page [ADDRESS_826038] intended device; and 
- Freedom from emergency surgery or reintervention related to the device or access procedure. 
10.2.3   Exploratory Endpoints 
- LVOT obstruction measured as a pressure gradient on catheterization and echocardiography 
- Incidence of LVOT obstruction > 20 mm Hg before di scharge and at 30 days, including as an alternative 
LVOT gradient threshold to the primary endpoint 
- Predicted neo-LVOT area based on THV frame had LAMPOON not been performed 
- MVARC 30-day Device Success 
- MVARC 30-day Procedure Success 
- MVARC 1-year Patient Success 
- Mortality, all-cause, cardiovascul ar vs non-cardiovascular, peri- vs non-periprocedural, LAMPOON and 
TMVR relatedness) 
- Neurological events as reported  by [CONTACT_620667] 
- Pre-discharge stroke, alone, and in combination with the primary endpoint 
- Myocardial infarction 
- Access and vascular complications 
- MVARC bleeding complications 
- AKIN acute kidney injury 
- Arrhythmia and conduction disturbances 
- Freedom from infection related to the TMVR at each time point 
- Freedom from hemolytic anemia related to TMVR/LAMPOON 
- Device related technical failure: Device  Failure, Paravalvular Leak, Perica rdial effusion, Conversion to open 
surgery, Device mal-positioning or migration or detachment, Device fracture, Unintended damage to native mitral valve apparatus 
- Aortic valve regurgitation change 
- Device thrombosis 
- Outcomes of subjects greater than 65 years (i.e. eligible for Medicare based on age), to determine generali-
zability to the Medicare population
[ADDRESS_826039] to MVR or TMVR in patients who are not believed to be at risk of life threatening LVOT obstruction.

IDE LAMPOON Page 24 of 43 2020-08-24 There are few data to guide clinical estimations of acceptable thresholds for iatrogenic LVOT obstruction.  
As for other elements of this protocol, we sought and found guidance in hype rtrophic cardiomyopathy, 
which is a better-characterized but related phenotype of non-valvular LVOT obstruction. 
Based on these data we estimate that residual iatrog enic LVOT obstruction less than 50mm is tolerable, 
because by [CONTACT_21128]21, 22 it appears not sufficiently severe to warrant surgical intervention in HCM.  
Moreover,  a systematic review by [CONTACT_620668] 23 distinguished obstructive from non-obstructive HCM at a

sessment of LVOT gradient appears to correspond to an equivalent catheter peak-to-peak measurement of LVOT gradient, in contrast to valvular aortic stenosis where the echocardiographic measurement corre-sponds to a lower catheter peak-to-peak LVOT gradient
24. 
The primary endpoint is designed around the MVARC guidelines19, to allow comparison with other mitral 
valve implantation trials, although tailored for the unique features of LAMPOON TMVR.  We believe these data and guidelines justify a residual LVOT threshold of up to [ADDRESS_826040] year: 
- Deaths 
- Primary endpoints 
- Valve embolization events 
- Site-reported strokes 
The CEAC will classify relatedness of the above events to the LAMPOON procedure. 
10.[ADDRESS_826041] (DSMB) appointed by [CONTACT_522917]. All members of the DSMB are unaffiliated to the study. The NHLBI DSMB will review the protocol progress report at six- 
month intervals. The DSMB may recommend early termin ation of the study for considerations of safety 
and efficacy. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (U ADEs) will be submitted to the DSMB following the 
same timelines as the IRB (See section 9.2.4). 
In the case of death or serious UADE, if the sponsor and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_620642] , the clinical trial will be terminated 
within [ADDRESS_826042]. [21 CFR 812.46].  All clinical sites will be notified of this action. 
Each institutional IRB will review all Serious Advers e Events, Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects, and 
Unanticipated Problems, and may choose to suspend or terminate the protocol based on those findings. We believe this will protect subject safety.   
 
IDE LAMPOON Page [ADDRESS_826043], to accommodate two strata 
of patients, and to focus on 30-day survival.  There ar e two clearly different strata of subjects to be en-
rolled in this study.  For TMVR in the setting of prio r annuloplasty (aka “valve-in-ring” or “valve-in-band”), 
the risk of valve migration and of severe paravalvul ar leak, attendant mortality, are much lower.  For 
TMVR in the setting of mitral annular calcification (a ka “valve-in-MAC”), patients are older and have more 
comorbidity, and the procedures are much more tech nically complex.  Accordingly, valve-in-MAC TMVR 
has higher mortality.  The reported 30-day mortality of valve-in-MAC in the global registry of 64 patients 
was 30%14.     
We propose two different stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], one for valve-in-ring and valve-in-band, and another for valve-
in-MAC.  While rules are provided for up to 30 subjects in each stratum, the total treated within both strata combined will not exceed 30. 
10.3.1  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_620643]-in-ring and for valve-in-band stratum 
The study will be monitored to ensure that the mortality with 30-days after the procedure does not sub-
stantially exceed an anticipated rate. We anticipate th e rate of 30-day mortality is 10% or less and deter-
mine the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106558] a Bayesian approach

data, which gives the prior parameters a = 0.6, b =5.4. Hence when we make decisions about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90348], the data from the study will dominate over the prior opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
The following table summarizes the threshold numbers for the stop rule boundary, which would lead to a 
recommendation to stop the study due to the excess 30-day mortality.

11.1 Definitions 
Adverse events : Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g., 
abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), sympto m, or disease, temporally associated with the sub-
ject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the 
research. 
 This will include: 
• Expected events related to the subject’s disease process during active enrollment in the research 
protocol and do not directly result from use of the investigational device or study. 
• Procedural events directly related to the cardiac catheterization procedure and recovery from the 
procedure and do not directly result from use of the investigational device. 
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE):  A serious adverse event that results in any of the following and NOT directly 
related to the device.  This includes any event that 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurs); 
• results in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32957]; 
• results in a persistent or significant incapacity; 
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect (not relevant to this study) ; or 
• based upon appropriate medical judgment, may je opardize the subject’s health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
Adverse Device Effect  (ADE): Any untoward or unintended response to a medical device.  This definition 
includes any event resulting from insu fficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deploy-
ment of the device or any event that is a result of user error. 
During this clinical investigation an event should be considered related to the device when it is the result 
of: 
•  LAMPOON procedure 
• Edwards Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] 3  transcatheter heart valve or accessories 
• Asahi-Intecc Astato XS 20  guidewire 
An event will be considered NOT related to the LAMPOON procedure when it  is the result of:  
• A pre-existing medical condition 
• Clearly attributable to TMVR but not LAMPOON part of procedure (example: commissural para-
valvular leak) 
Anticipated Adverse Device Effects (AADEs ): An AADE is an ad verse event with a reas onable possibility that 
the device or procedure caused or contributed to th e event. The following AADEs are considered antici-
pated based on previous human experience: 
• LAMPOON device failure including failure to traverse, to lacerate, or to position catheters or 
guidewires 
• Valve malposition, reposition, dislocation, migr ation, or embolization or deployment in unin-
tended location

haptoglobin decline 
• Low platelets or thrombocytopenia or increased or reduced leukocytes 
• Mechanical injury to the myocardium, access vasc ulature, cardiac valves that may require inter-
vention or that may elevate Troponin 
• Bleeding causing anemia and blood transfusions 
• Mitral valve thrombosis 
• Embolization of air, calcific valve material, atheroma, or thrombus to coronaries, brain, limbs, or 
viscera causing myocardial infarction, stroke, or limb ischemia

• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_620646] 
• Infection including access site or urin ary or pulmonary or including sepsis 
• Pain including back pain and access site and generalized 
• Cardiac arrest 
• Death 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE): An adverse effect that may have been or is attributed to the use of 
the device and produce an injury or illness that is life-threatening, results in permanent impairment or 
damage to the body, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE): Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated  with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death 
was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or ap-
plication (including a supplementary plan or applicat ion), or any other unanticipated serious problem as-
sociated with a device that relates to the rights , safety, or welfare of subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
 
IDE LAMPOON Page 29 of 43 2020-08-24 Unanticipated Problem (Up): An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets ALL of the following criteria: 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, seve rity, or frequency in relation to: 
a. the research risks that are desc ribed in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent docu-
ment, Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and  
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied, and  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research, and  
• Places subjects or others at a greater risk of ha rm (including physical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Protocol Deviation:  A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of an IRB-approved research protocol. 
11.2 Adverse event management: 
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each subject 
while on the study.  Adverse events and adverse device effects will be attributed to study procedure and graded by [CONTACT_620669]: 
11.2.[ADDRESS_826046]’s condition. Not surpassing the expected standard medical inter-
vention. 
Moderate Condition creates a level of discomfo rt that interferes with the subject’s usual 
activity or affects clinical status. May require medical intervention.  
Severe Incapacitating and significantly affect s the subject’s clinical status. Likely re-
quires medical intervention and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
11.2.2  Attribution of adverse events to the research protocol 
The relatedness of adverse events will be classified as: 
Classification Description 
Definite The event is clearly related to the research protocol. 
Probable The event is likely related to the research protocol. The event has a reasona-
ble temporal relationship to the research device or research procedure and 
alternative causes, such as underlying disease, concomitant medications, or 
concomitant treatment-can be excluded. 
Possible The event may be related to the research protocol. The event has a reasona-
ble temporal relationship to the research device or research procedure, and 
 
IDE LAMPOON Page 30 of 43 2020-08-24 attribution of the event to the device or procedure cannot be excluded. How-
ever, alternative causes—such as underlying disease, concomitant medica-
tions, or concomitant treatments—are presumably responsible. 
Unlikely It is doubtful the event is related to the research protocol. The event can rea-
sonably be explained by [CONTACT_522921], including underlying disease, concom-

Unrelated The event is clearly not related to the research protocol. There either is no 
temporal association with the research device or procedure, or the event is 
readily explained by [CONTACT_522921], including underlying disease, concomitant medications, or concomitant treatments.  
 
11.2.3  Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse event recording will start on Day (0) of the LAMPOON TMVR procedure and will continue through 
the 12-month Follow Up. New events or conditions pr esent at baseline that increase in severity will be 
recorded and evaluated and reported on the case report form. Once the subject has completed the 30-day follow up, only serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE), unanticipated de-vice effects (UADE) and unanticipated problems (UP) will be reported to the Sponsor.  It is the responsibil-
ity of the site investigator to report adverse events and adverse device effects to their respective IRBs or other regulatory bodies according to their reporting requirements. Monitoring visits will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_620670], and accuracy and completion of the adverse event case re-port forms. 
11.2.4  Adverse event reporting timeframes: 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
• All serious adverse events will be reported to the Sponsor immediately but not later than 3 
working days from the event. The respective institutional IRB should be notified according to their requirements.  
• The serious adverse event will be evaluated by [CONTACT_456]. If determined to be an unantici-
pated adverse device effect that increases the risk to the participating subjects, the sponsor 
will terminate the investigation within [ADDRESS_826047] notified of the event. [21 CFR 812.46] 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) 
• Must be reported to the Sponsor and the institutional IRB immediately but no later than 10 
working days after the investigator learns of the event. [21 CFR 812.150] 
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects should be reported via telephone as well as on the ad-
verse event section of the case report form.  
• If the event is determined by [CONTACT_380141] a UADE, the Sponsor will report the event to 
all investigators to enable reporting to their respective IRB/regulatory bodies. The Sponsor will provide this notification to participating si tes and to the FDA within [ADDRESS_826048].  [21 CFR 812.150] 
 
IDE LAMPOON Page 31 of 43 2020-08-24 • All Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects will be  reported by [CONTACT_620671] 801 “Reporting Research Events”.  
Deaths 
• The investigator will notify the Sponsor immediat ely but within [ADDRESS_826049]’s death, whether the death is device  related or clinical condition. Institutional 
IRB’s will be notified according to the specific institutional regulatory requirements for report-
ing a death.  
• The Sponsor will notify the NIH IRB of a subject’ s death, if applicable, per NIH Policy 801 “Re-
porting Research Events”.  
• A subject’s death will be recorded on the Case Report Form.  
12.[ADDRESS_826050] Selection 
12.1.1  Study population: 
Subjects are selected for being adults who are determined otherwise likely to benefit from transcatheter 
mitral valve replacement yet are expected to suffer TM VR-related left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) ob-
struction. The determination will be made by [CONTACT_522924].   No pa-
tient will be excluded from participation based on gender, race or ethnicity.   
Subjects who are unable to provide consent may be  enrolled, if allowed by [CONTACT_522927]. 
12.2 Risks and Discomforts 
There are no approved commercial devices indicated for TMVR. A formal risk analysis is provided in APPENDIX A. Risks of TMVR will be considered separately from  the risks of preparatory LAMPOON before TMVR.  
Known risks of TMVR include 
• Death 
• Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction 
• Toxic reaction to anesthesia, medications,  contrast media, or device materials 
• Bleeding, hypotension, shock, anemia and complications of their treatment 
• Vascular complications including requiring mechanical repair  
• Conduction system injury which may require pacemaker therapy 
• Embolization of air, calcific valve material, atheroma, or thrombus to coronaries, brain, limbs, 
or viscera causing myocardial infarction, stroke, etc 
• Paravalvular leak 
• Malposition or embolization of the TMVR device 
• Transcatheter heart valve dysfun ction, including mechanical, degenerative, or thrombotic 
• Myocardial perforation and pericardial tamponade 
• Complications of transcatheter or surgical tr ansapi[INVESTIGATOR_620647], pericar-
dial tamponade, hemothorax 
• Cardiac valvular or subvalvular injury causing myocardial dysfunction 
• Congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, respi[INVESTIGATOR_620648] 32 of 43 2020-08-24 • Renal injury or failure 
• TMVR failure requiring emergency cardiac surger y or emergency mechanical circulatory assis-
tance 
• Radiation injury including intractable skin injury 
• Endocarditis or endarteritis or sepsis 
• Hemolysis 
Anticipated risks of preparatory LAMPOON before TMVR include: 
• Death 
• Avulsion or other injury of the aortomitral cu rtain, which is expected to lead to death 
• Failure of the LAMPOON procedure, leading to LVOT obstruction, the life-threatening compli-
cation the LAMPOON procedure is intended to obviate 
• Early or late thrombosis or thromboembolism ca using stroke or acute visceral or limb ische-
mia 
• Hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion 
• Hemorrhagic shock requiring vasopressor support 
• Injury to the aortic valve caus ing aortic valve regurgitation 
• Aortic injury such as aortic  dissection or pseudoaneurysm 
• Hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia as a co nsequence of blood flow across the struts of 
the THV  
• Infective endocarditis relate d to the TMVR of the lacerated mitral valve leaflet 
• Nephrotoxic injury due to iodinated radiocontrast used in follow-up CT assessment, including 
causing temporary or permanent hemodialysis 
• Embolization of the THV is a theoretical risk of LAMPOON although we do not expect LAM-
POON to contribute to this life-threatening complication. 
The sponsor and investigators recognize these risks are high and reflect the underlying comorbidities yet 
consider procedural hemorrhage overall to be an acceptable compromise to enable treatment of the un-derlying mitral valve failure in  patients otherwise ineligible.

13.1 Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] 3 transcathete r heart valve, PMA P140031 
This protocol tests a method (LAMPOON).  It also uses  marketed devices off-label.  The indications for use 
of these devices are shown below. 
The Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] 3 transcatheter heart valve , model 9600TFX, and accessories are indicated for relief 
of aortic stenosis in patients with symptomatic heart disease due to severe native calcific aortic stenosis 
who are judged by a Heart Team, including a cardiac surgeo n, to be at intermediate or greater risk for open

Surgeons (STS) risk score and other clinical co-morbidities unmeasured by [CONTACT_620672]). 
We do not plan to market these devices.  We plan to employ these devices in a valve position different 
from the intended use, in the mitral valve position whether in the presence of a surgical annuloplasty ring or band, or in the presence of native mitral annular calc ification.    For this off-label use, the Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] 3 THV 
is delivered using its intended delivery system, but it is loaded with the orientation reversed for antegrade implantation via a transfemoral  transseptal catheter route. 
The LAMPOON method is described in the study procedures. 
13.2 Asahi-Intecc Astato XS 20, 510(k) K103057 
The Astato 0.014” guidewire is used for transcatheter electrosurgery in two steps in this procedure.  First 
it is used for leaflet traversal during electrification.  This procedure is similar to the use of the Astato XS20 
and an amputated Asahi Confienza Pro 12 in the transcaval IDE investigation recently published 
27. 
Second, the midshaft is focally denuded and electrified for the leaflet traversal step.  This is described in 
the pre-clinical 15 and early clinical 17 manuscript. 
Neither of these procedures are addressed in the indications for use: 
Asahi-Intec Astato XS 20:  This product is intended to facilitat e the placement and exchange of diag-
nostic and therapeutic devices during intravascular pr ocedures. This device is intended for peripheral 
vascular use only.

1. BACKGR OUND  
 
1.1 Study Disease  
 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common 
cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (MERS -CoV) and Severe 
Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_339948] (SARS -CoV).  
 
Coronavirus disease (COVID -19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been 
previously identified in humans.  COVID -19 is caused by [CONTACT_339970][INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2 virus).  
 
Common signs of infection include respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], fever, cough, shortness of breath and 
breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686], kidney failure and even death. On March 11, the CO VID-19 outbreak was 
characterized as a pandemic by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) .[ADDRESS_420557] Light Therapy Device consists of a light -emitting diode 
(LED) catheter intended to provide adjunctive t herapy to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19, 
including both ambulatory and intubated patients. The device consists of an array of twelve (12) 
Ultraviolet Light A (UVA) diodes in the 343 nm (±5 nm) spectrum that is intended to be inserted 
in standard endo tracheal tubes of mechanically ventilated patients for [ADDRESS_420558] Light Therapy Device consists of a UVA Light Catheter, Umbilical, 
and Control Unit. The System has b een designed to be used in routine commercially available 
endotracheal and nasopharyngeal tubes. For endotracheal applications, the UVA Light Catheter 
will be attached to the Avanos(R) multiaccess port and maintained inside a sealed sheath when not 
in use.   
 
The UVA Light Catheter sterilized by [CONTACT_339971] [STERILE|EO] sterilization and intended 
for a single patient for the duration of treatment, and then should be disposed of per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91408]. The UVA Light Catheter is a medical -grade fluorinated e thylene propylene (FEP) 
catheter tube that has the light UVA light array fixture mounted inside, which is inserted entirely 
inside the airway to deliver the light therapy. The UVA Light Catheter is marked with [ADDRESS_420559] distance before the UV light is turned 
on. The UVA Light Catheter is connected to the Umbilical, which is a flexible power and air 
connector between the Light Catheter and Controller. The Umbilical may be cleaned, disinfected, 
and reus ed, with a useful life of up to twenty treatments. The Controller houses the user interface 
controls, and air compressor, and associated firmware. The Controller may be cleaned, disinfected, 
and reused, with a useful life of up to five years.  
 
Protocol: UVL -[ADDRESS_420560], acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_269449] (mainly 
from SARS -CoV -2, the virus responsible for COVID -19) thought to enter via the nasal passages 
and pharynx makes its way down the trachea and upper airways. Eventuall y, the infection results 
in a cytokine storm affecting the lungs, and subsequent damage to alveoli and lung tissue results 
in the lethality seen in more severe flu viral infections, especially those fatalities among healthy 
young adults. In addition, bacte ria and fungi can cause a secondary infection in mechanically 
ventilated patients.

Confidential  8 3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 Accr ual goal  
 
Patients newly intubated (within 24 hours) on mechanical ventilation with COVID -19 who meet 
all other study inclusion criteria and none of the study exclusion criteria.  
 
Target Total: 5 subjects  
 
 
3.2 Duration of Study Participation  
 
Subjects will be treated for up to 5 days and will be followed until day 30, discharge from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339956](whichever comes earlier);; adverse events will be captured throughout study.  
 
 
Day 0: Enrollment, informed consent, baseline assessment, pre -insertion endotracheal sampling 
(within 24 hrs of enrollment), device deployment (within 24 hours of enrollment).  
 
Day 1: endotracheal sampling (24h after initial device deployment); ongoing da ily UV light 
treatment while mechanical ventilation is continued.  
 
Days 2 – 4: endotracheal microbiologic  assessment , daily UV light treatment while mechanical 
ventilation is continued (for total of up to 5 doses, day 0 through day 4)  
 
Day 5 – endotracheal  and catheter tip sampling  
 
Days 5 -30: Assessment of clinical status  
 
4. STUDY ENTRY, ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL  
 
4.[ADDRESS_420562] (or surrogate) signing informed consent.  Study enrollment, as used in this protocol, will 
be defined as the investigator’s confirmation of the subject’s eligibility by [CONTACT_339972]. Each study participant, including participants who have screened failed, who  sign an 
informed consent form, should be entered into the study database.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339957] -19 cases and are in communication with 
investigators running COVID -19 trials. Treating physicians of COVID -19 patients will be made 
aware of the research offering.  
 
Protocol: UVL -[ADDRESS_420563] researchers with surrogate decision 
makers to determine if a research option is appropriate for the patient.  
 
Note: patients may be in isolation units. Therefore, this contact [CONTACT_339973]’s room with visualization from the treating physician and research from the window 
outside the room to minimize cont act. 
 
Research teams may also request to receive a daily list of COVID -19 patients in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339958]6 or reports requested by [CONTACT_339974].  The research 
staff can pre -screen the patients by [CONTACT_339975].  
 
Process of Informed Consent Considerations:  
 
Given limited supplies of personal protective equipment and isolation requirements, consent may 
be provided over the phone and, when feasible, with direct visualization through the patient room 
window or using a video platform to minimize entry into the room.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_339959]. The signed 
consent in these circumstances will be photographed and saved electronically. The consenting 
physician and witness (when the patient is a non -English speaker) will sign a second full copy of 
the consent and print/attach the photographed pati ent’s signature [CONTACT_3264].  
 
Given isolation precaution for this population, potential subjects who have capacity to consent 
and who have access to a smartphone, tablet, or computer with them in their room may be 
provided a link to a digital version of the conse nt form using REDCap or  DocuSign to avoid the 
use of paper, which cannot be removed from the containment unit. If the potential subject does 
not have access to a smartphone/online consent form, then a paper copy will be used .  An 
electronic consent may als o be sent by [CONTACT_20143] a surrogate off site.  
 
While patients may be approached soon after their visit and/or admission begins, they can take 
time to consider and discuss participation with others before deciding. All questions will be 
answered by [CONTACT_339976].  
 
For the enrollment of non -English speaking subjects, certified medical interpreters will be used 
with the short form consent. A certified medical interpreter will be present (over the phone) to 
translate the docum ent and interpret the consent discussion following IRB policy. A witness to 
the consent process must sign the consent form and short form, but the witness does not need to 
be fluent in both languages.  If the interpreter is unable to sign as witness, a cha rt note should 
document the identity and involvement of the interpreter.  
 
As a last resort, if the potential subject has capacity to consent, but:  
Protocol: UVL -0001  
Confidential  10 1. a potential subjects’ room does not have a window for consent form visualization; thus a 
paper consent form cannot be used to document consent, AND  
2. the potential subject could not use their own device (e.g., are not comfortable enough 
with the technology to use it for this purpose) and/or there was no other device available, 
thus an electronic signature [CONTACT_339988] a hard copy signature [CONTACT_127908], 
then the consent process can follow that of subjects who have capacity to obtain consent 
but cannot physically sign the consent. This consent process is as follows: the consent 
discussion is over the phon e with the consenting investigator, study team member if 
applicable, translator if applicable, and an independent witness (e.g., the clinical nurse). 
The witness will sign the consent form for two purposes: 1) to document translation was 
provided, if short  forms were used to enroll a non -English speaker, and 2) to document 
the patient agreed to participate but could not physically sign the form.  There should also 
be a chart note to describe the process and explain why the subject was physically unable 
to sign the consent form.  
 
 
Considerations for the Enrollment of Individuals who Lack 
Capacity to Consent:  
 
Related to the enrollment of cognitively impaired subjects through a surrogate informed consent 
process (CA law):  
The research relates to life -threateni ng diseases and conditions of the participants and holds out 
the prospect of direct benefit . The consenting co -investigators (MDs) will determ ine the patient’s 
capacity to provide consent. Subjects who lack capacity will be given the opportunity to dissent  
where appropriate. An individual who has Power of Attorney or who is otherwise authorized to 
make health care decisions for a potential research subject may not provide consent on behalf of 
the potential subject if the potential subject has the cognitive capacity to provide consent for 
themselves. The research will not enroll persons under psychiatric conservatorship or persons on 
a voluntary or involuntary psychiatric hold. The surrogates will not be paid for providing 
informed consent. If a subject shoul d regain capacity during their participation, they will be 
informed of the nature of their participation and given the opportunity to consent to continue to 
participate in the research or refuse to continue to take part in the study. The study team will 
document the surrogate decision makers who are involved and available to provide informed 
consent for the subject, their relationship to the subject, and their respective decisions.  
 
Surrogate Consent obtained remotely: REDCap or DocuSign may be used for rem ote consent of 
surrogate decision makers, as there are restrictions in place that preclude in -person visitors. The 
remote consent process may take place over the phone or via a video visit to allow the consent 
conversation and process, and signature [CONTACT_339989], 
or the surrogate may scan/email their signed copy for the investigator to either print and sign, or 
add an Adobe digital signature. If need be, the surrogate could fax their signature [CONTACT_339990]/em ailing.  
 
Review the surrogate consent section in the consent process policy  (starting on page 18 of the 
policy), including the decision tree for who can serve as surrogate decision maker per [LOCATION_004] 
Protocol: UVL -0001  
Confidential  11 law in non -emergency and emergency settings (starting on page 20 of the policy). If a surrogate 
decision maker is not able to sig n (e.g. spouse), then the study team can continue down the 
priority list of surrogate decision makers.  
 
Note: In some instances a surrogate decision maker is able to provide verbal consent, but unable 
to use REDCap or other technology needed for the docum ented consent process to take place. 
Given the limitations to visitors and widespread nature of the risks of COVID -19, in these 
instances, obtain the surrogate’s permission to contact [CONTACT_339977]. Record a note in the research record of this consent 
conversation and the process used to subsequently obtain written/documented consent from a 
surrogate decision maker.

criteria.  
 
  
 
4.3 Cancellation Guidelines  
 
The following are reasons f or withdrawal of subjects from the study:  
 
▪ A subject does not meet the eligibility criteria; (the subject will be considered a screen 
failure).   
▪ A subject withdraws consent,  
 
Regardless of reason for withdrawal, an intention to treat analysis will be performed.

7.1 Possible Risk Associated with the Device (i.e. Treatment Emergent Adverse Eevent)  
 
• Heat/thermal injury to nasal passages/pharynx (nasopharyngeal insertion) or 
trachea/vocal cords (e ndotracheal insertion)  
o This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_339979]. In addition, a 
thermistor will automatically shut off the device if the temperature of the d evice 
exceeds 43 degrees C.  
• Decreased ventilation/oxygenation due to partial airway occlusion in mechanically 
ventilated patients  
o This risk is mitigated through experimental determination that airway pressures 
and tidal volumes are not affected when the d evice is deployed in an ETT size 
7.5mm or greater. Therefore, patients with ETT sizes smaller than 7.5mm are 
excluded.  
• Trauma to the carina (due to over -insertion in mechanically ventilated patients)  
o This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_339980], 
intended to be inserted until the cm markings of the device align with markings of 
the ETT.  
• Allergic reaction to device materials  
o With proper use of the device, there is no physical contact [CONTACT_339981].

 TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE:  5 
 TOTAL ACC URAL:  5 
 STUDY DURATION: [ADDRESS_420578] -in-human open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_339968]19. Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], it is not 
powered to any specific endpoint.   
 
 
9.5 Statistical Analysis  
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all the subjects. Demographics 
and baseline characteristics include: age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and body mass 
index (BMI).  
• Height (in cm)=height (in inches)*2.54  
• Weight (in kg) = weight (in lbs)*0.4536  
• BMI = weight/height2 (Kg/m2) 
Both primary and secondary endpoints will be presented using descriptive statistics. For 
continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the number of subjects with data to be 
summarized ( n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum (max). 
The same number of decimal places as in the raw data will be presented when reporting min and 
max, one more decimal place than in the raw data will be presented when reporting mean  and 
median, and two more decimal places than in the raw data will be presented when reporting SD. 
Protocol: UVL -[ADDRESS_420579] three decimals or more, three decimals will be presented for mean, median, 
min and max, and SD.  
 
All the categorical data will be presen ted by [CONTACT_33335]. The denominator for each 
percentage will be the number of subjects within the population treatment group unless otherwise 
specified. All percentage will be presented with one decimal point.  
 
All analyses and summary outputs w ill be generated using SAS version 9.3.  
  
 
10. INVESTIGATORS RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
10.1 Investigator Responsibility/Performance  
 
The investigator (or a person designated by [CONTACT_093]) should inform the patient (or 
surrogate) of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information.  
 
The investigator should provide the patient ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of 
the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study.  All questions about the study 
should be a nswered to the satisfaction of the patient (or surrogate). Neither the investigator, nor 
the study staff, should coerce or unduly influence a patient to participate or to continue to 
participate in a study.  
 
10.2 Confidentiality  
 
The identity of the patients in this study will be treated as confidential. Patients eligible to 
participate i n the study following the pr e-treatment visit will be assigned a unique patient code. 
The results of the study, including any other data, may be published for scienti fic purposes but will 
not give the patients' name [CONTACT_98819].  
 
However, any records or data obtai ned as a result of the patient  participation in this study may be 
inspected by [CONTACT_456], by [CONTACT_339984], by [CONTACT_941] H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_98802], 
or by [CONTACT_339985], provided that such inspectors are legally obligated to 
protect any identifiable information from public disclosure, except where disclosure is otherwise 
required by [CONTACT_7720] a c ourt of competent jurisdiction. These records will be kept private in so far as 
permitted by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
10.[ADDRESS_420580] (or 
surrogate) participating in this study after adequate explanation, in lay language, of the methods, 
objectives, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study.  The investigator must also 
explain that the subject is completely  free to refuse to enter the study or to discontinue participation 
at any time (for any reason) and receive alternative conventional therapy as indicated.  Prior to 
Protocol: UVL -[ADDRESS_420581] (or surrogate) will sign an IRB approved informed consent  form 
and receive a copy of same (and information leaflet, if appropriate).  
 
The investigator or designee must explain to the subject before enrollment into the study that for 
evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtaine d during the study 
may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and the IRB.  It is the investigator’s 
(or designee’s) responsibility to obtain permission to use protected health information per HIPAA 
from each subject, or if appropriate, the  subjects’ parent or legal guardian.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_420582] of the study 
and to ensure that study data can be subsequently verified.  These doc uments will be classified into 
two separate categories: (1) investigator study file and (2) subject clinical source documents that 
corroborate data collected on the CRF’s.  Subject clinical source documents would include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic patient records; ph ysician's and nurse's notes; original laboratory, radiology, 
pathology, and special assessment reports; QOL forms, signed informed consent forms.  When the 
CRF or any form is used as the source document, this will be clearly stated in the investigator 
study file.  
 
At a minimum, the following be documented in source documents:  
 
• Medical history/physical condition and diagnosis of the subject before involvement 
in the study sufficient to verify protocol entry criteria . 
• Study number , assigned subject number, an d verification that written informed 
consent was obtained (each recorded in dated and signed notes on the day of entry 
into the study)  
• Progress notes for each subject visit . 
• Laboratory test results . 
• Condition and response of subject upon completion of or early termination from 
the study . 
 
10.[ADDRESS_420583] and  will be stored in a secure location at each investigation 
site.  Additionally, physical CRFs will be digitized , and sent to the sponsor’s HIPAA compliant 
server for analysis and long-term storage.  A CRF is required for every patient who received any 
study intervention.  The investigator will ensure that the CRF’s are accurate, complete, legible and 
timely.  Separate source records are required to support all CRF entries.   All corrections to study 
data will be made by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the information to be corrected without 
obscuring it.  All corrections will be initialed, dated and explained, if  necessary. Do not use 
“white -out” or obscuring correction tape.   
 
10.6 Non-Protocol Research  
 
Protocol: UVL -[ADDRESS_420584] the study in compliance with the protocol, current good clinical 
practices, and all applicable (local, FDA) regulatory guidelines and standard of ethics .

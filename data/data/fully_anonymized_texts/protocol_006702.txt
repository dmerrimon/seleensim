Protocol PRO00047510 Rev. 1.0 
Confidential and Proprietary to Phase Diagnostics, Inc  5 of 13  BACKGROUND / RATIONALE Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS-CoV. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in December [ADDRESS_894712] (INDICAID Rapid Test) is a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_894713] 7 days of symptom onset.   In the [LOCATION_003], testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, that meet the requirements to perform moderate, high, or waived complexity tests. The INDICAID Rapid Test)is intended for use at the Point of Care (POC), i.e., in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation.  The test is intended for use by [CONTACT_662822], and individuals similarly trained in point of care settings but who are not laboratory professionals.    
Protocol PRO00047510 Rev. 1.0 
Confidential and Proprietary to Phase Diagnostics, Inc  6 of 13  Positive results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. This antigen is generally detectable in upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_662818]. Positive results indicate the presence of viral antigens, but clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the [LOCATION_002] and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities.   Negative results should be treated as presumptive, do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, including infection control decisions. Negative results should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and confirmed with a molecular assay, if necessary, for patient management.    PRINCIPLE OF TEST The INDICAID Rapid Test is a chromatographic rapid test (approximately 20 minutes) that uses a sandwich immunoassay design to directly and qualitatively detect the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_894714] are visually interpreted.  After collecting the swab, the patient’s sample is placed in the Buffer Solution Vial containing an extraction buffer. The sample is dispensed into the sample well of the test device and migrates through the test strip that contains antibodies conjugated to a chromophore (detector particle). This antibody-chromophore conjugate will bind to the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_894715] line (“T”). STUDY OVERVIEW The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the INDICAID Rapid Test. This will be established by [CONTACT_662823] (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA) between the results of the test under investigation and an EUA-approved RT-PCR test, using clinical samples collected from COVID-[ADDRESS_894716] device in the hands of the intended user at the point-of-care (POC) setting.

Confidential and Proprietary to Phase Diagnostics, Inc  11 of 13  Reporting Adverse Events No adverse events (AEs) are anticipated for this study. The study is performed entirely in vitro.  The INDICAID Rapid Test is for investigative use only and labeled accordingly.  Test results obtained with the INDICAID Rapid Test are not reported to the appropriate health authorities or used as a diagnosis or determine a treatment method.  If an AE or unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) occurs during a study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_662819] [ADDRESS_894726] learning of the event. Phase Diagnostics Clinical Affairs will evaluate the AE of the UADE as soon as it is received. Phase Diagnostics will report the AE or UADE according to local and country specific reporting requirements, all governing institutional review boards (IRBs), and all participating PIs.  DATA AND RECORDS MANAGEMENT  Study Data and Records Maintenance According to 21 CFR 812.140(d), Investigators are required to maintain records for a period of two years after the later of the following two dates: (1) the date on which the investigation is terminated or completed or (2) the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of supporting a premarket approval application, a notice of completion of a protocol development protocol, a humanitarian device exemption application, a premarket notification submission, or a request for De Novo classification.  Study binders will be provided to each site to organize the required study records and documentation. Each site will be directly responsible for the maintenance and organization of the study documentation. During and after the study, all the information will be submitted to reviewed by [CONTACT_662828].  MONITORING PLAN Contact [CONTACT_118735] [INVESTIGATOR_662820], telephone calls, and e-mail. The purpose of site visits will be, verify adherence to the study protocol, and review all study-related documentation and records. A site initiation visit will be conducted to confirm preparedness for protocol execution, confirm satisfactory site facilities, review and clarify regulations and protocol requirements, and train the site personnel prior to activating the site for enrollment. On-site and remote interim monitoring visits will be conducted as needed. A close-out visit will be conducted to ensure all study data and documentation is complete and accurate. STATISTICAL METHODS This section describes the overall approach to data analysis. This proposed design enables evaluation of variance over various factors. All data analysis will be performed in accordance with general principles espoused in CLSI EP124.  
Protocol PRO00047510 Rev. 1.[ADDRESS_894727]  Infected Not Infected Total Positive TP FP TP+FP Negative FN TN FN+TN Total TP+FN FP+TN TP+FP+FN+TN TP = true positive TN = true negative FP = false positive    FN = false negative PPA = TP/(TP+FN) NPA = TN/(TN+FP) OPA = (TP+TN)/Total Samples  The following performance characteristics will be computed: PPA, NPA, OPA and accuracy. The 95% confidence interval for these performance characteristics will be computed using Wilson-Score method.  ADMINISTRATION Site Qualification All sites will be assessed and approved by [CONTACT_662829], equipment, and personnel in place to conduct the trial in accordance with the approved protocol and to abide by [CONTACT_662830] (GCP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and applicable [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any site for failure to follow the study protocol, and substitute with a new site that meets these and other study protocol requirements.   IRB Review and Approval Institutional Review Board approval will be obtained for the study protocol.  Training Site personnel shall be trained prior to performing any study procedures. Training shall include, but is not limited to, the study protocol, personnel responsibilities, specimen documentation, data recording and reporting, specimen handling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and transmission of the data to Phase Diagnostics.  Protocol Deviations Deviations from the study protocol is not allowed.  Any proposed (planned) deviation will be documented by [CONTACT_662831]. PHASE will review and assess the proposed deviation prior to approving/rejecting the deviation.  Unplanned deviation will be documented and reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_662821].  Phases will determine whether or not the deviation has affected the validity of any associated results.

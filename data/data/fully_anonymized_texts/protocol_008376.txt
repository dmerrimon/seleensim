 CLINICAL TRIAL SUMMARY 
 
COMPOUNDS: SAR245408 and 
SAR245409  STUDY No : TED12414 
TITLE International, multicenter, open-label, treatment-extension study for 
subjects who completed a Phase 1 or Phase 2 parental study to 
continue receiving treatment with SAR245408 or SAR245409 as a 
monotherapy or as a combination regimen.  
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION International. 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 Primary Objective To determine the long term safety and tolerability of SAR245408 and 
SAR245409 as a monotherapy or as part of a combination regimen 
in subjects who are benefiting from treatment. 
Secondary Objective(s) 
Not applicable. 
STUDY DESIGN This treatment-extension, open-l abel, international, multicenter, 
nonrandomized study is designed to provide continued access to 
SAR245408 or SAR245409 as a monotherapy or as part of a 
combination regimen.  
All subjects in the study will receive SAR245408 or SAR245409; the 
respective dose will be either the recommended Phase 2 dose (400 mg SAR245408 [tablet formulation polymorph A] once daily or 
50 mg SAR245409 [capsule formulation] twice daily) or the subject’s 
established dose either as a monotherapy or in a combination regimen in the parental study. 
SAR245408 is administered orally and is supplied as a capsule or a 
tablet formulation polymorph A or E. SAR245409 is administered 
orally and is supplied as a capsule or a tablet formulation. For all 
subjects, the dose, regimen, fo rmulation, and food condition for 
study drug intake of SAR245408 or SAR245409 (and the dose and regimen of combination medication(s) for subjects taking 
combination therapy) will be agreed on in writing between the site 
and the Sponsor prior to first dose. 
Subjects who will enter the treatment extension study on Day 1 of 
the Initiation Period are those who: 
• Received SAR245408 or SAR245409 for less than 2 cycles in 
the parental study 
• Had dose interruption in the parental study but fulfill parental protocol criteria to restart IMP 
• Fulfill the parental study criteria for IMP treatment continuation 
but have ongoing Grade 2 AE(s) 
• Will take a daily dose higher than their established dose in the parental study  
Subjects who received SAR245408 or SAR245409 for at least 2 cycles in the parental study will enter the treatment-extension study 
on Day 1 of the Extension Period.

 Subjects may continue in the study until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, until commercial 
supplies of SAR245408 or SAR245409 are available to them outside of the clinical trial, or other reasons detailed in Section 22). 
STUDY POPULATION  
Main selection criteria:  Males or females enrolled in Phase [ADDRESS_1234096] complete data collection for 
the primary endpoint(s) of the parental study or who are being 
treated beyond the parental study cut-off. 
Total expected number of subjects: Approximately 100-150. 
Expected number of sites: Approximately 28. 
STUDY TREATMENT(s)  
Investigational Medicinal Product N° 1 SAR245408 
Formulation: (Form A) hard capsules: 25 and 100 mg. 
(Form A) tablets: 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg; and (form E) film-coated 
tablets 50, and 200 mg . 
Route of administration: Oral.  Capsules or tablets shoul d be taken with 8 ounces (240 mL) of 
water, with no food allowed for at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after dosing. The administration of polymorph E tablets with food is 
allowed, ie, with the morning meal with a full glass of non-carbonated 
water. 
Dose regimen: Recommended Phase 2 dose (4 00 mg [tablet formulation 
polymorph A] once daily) or estab lished dose and regimen, either as 
a monotherapy or in a combination regimen in the parental study.   
Because of the expi[INVESTIGATOR_19860] (form A) tablet, patients need to be 
transitioned to (form E) film-coated tablet. Patients will continue 
taking the same dose that they were receiving of (form A) tablet. 
Subjects who are receiving in the parental study an established dose 
of SAR245408 different than the suggested dose above, may continue on the established dose. 
For subjects taking combination t herapy, if in the Investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_882353] y benefited from the combination 
therapy the subject may continue on SAR245408 only. 
For all subjects, the dose, regimen, and formulation of SAR245408 
(and the dose and regimen of combinat ion medication[s] for subjects 
taking combination therapy) should be agreed on in writing between 
the site and the Sponsor prior to first dose and should not exceed 
the maximum tolerated dose for the parental study. 
Investigational Medicinal Product N° 2 SAR245409 
Formulation: SAR245409A hard capsules: 10, 30, 40, and [ADDRESS_1234097] capsule strength, ongoing patients who are receiving a dose lower than 30 mg will continue treatment at a comparable dose level 
in consultation with the sponsor (see Section 8.1.2).   
Film-coated tablets: 20 and 30 mg.

This open-label, international, multicenter, treatment-extension study will enable cancer patients who 
are currently receiving benefit from either  SAR245408, formerly known as XL147, or SAR245409, 
formerly known as XL765, as a monotherapy or as part of a combination regimen in a Phase 1 or 
Phase 2 study to continue receiving treatment and further assess safety and tolerability of SAR245408 
and SAR245409. 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
SAR245408 is an oral, potent and selective inhibi tor of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase). 
SAR245409 is an oral, potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of PI3K which also inhibits mTOR.  
More detailed information is provide d in the latest version of the Investigator Brochures (IBs) for 
SAR245408 and SAR245409. 
4.2 RATIONALE 
4.2.1 Study rationale 
This study is designed to provide conti nued access to either SAR245408 or SAR245409, as a 
monotherapy, or as part of a combination regimen with a commercially available drug(s), to subjects 
enrolled in a sanofi-aventis sponsored Phase [ADDRESS_1234117] complete data collection for the primary end point(s) of the parental study or who are being 
treated beyond the parental study cut-off date , and who are receiving benefit from the study 
treatment.  
The primary objective of the study is to collect safety data on subjects who are benefiting from 
continued treatment. Safety assessments and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the study flow chart (see Section 1.2 ) and per standard of care if the subject is on a 
combination regimen.  
4.2.2 Design rationale and risk assessment 
This is a treatment-extension stud y which will be conducted as an open label, international, multi-
institutional study. SAR245408 or SA R245409 will be given at a fixed dose as a monotherapy or in 
combination regimen. If in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] a subject has maximally benefited from the 
combination regimen the subject may c ontinue on SAR245408 or SAR245409 only.

4.2.3 Safety parameters rationale 
[IP_ADDRESS] SAR245408 treatment 
As of June 2011, for [ADDRESS_1234119] common side effects 
reported in ≥10% of subjects have been gastrointestinal related (such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, 
and constipation); constitutional (such as decreased appetite, fatigue, and asthenia); or an increase in 
both aspartate aminotransferase (A ST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transaminase elevations 
have been Grade [ADDRESS_1234120] treated with SAR245408 in combination 
with letrozole. The transaminase elevation re solved after SAR245408 was discontinued. Overall, 
approximately 36% of subjects de veloped rash (including erythematous, macular, pustular, and 
acneiform), approximately 25% developed dyspnea and cough, approximately 18% reported anemia. 
Neutropenia was noted in approx imately 76% of subjects treated in combination with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
Grade [ADDRESS_1234121] experienced a Grade 3 hypersensitivity 
reaction; each of which resolved with medical inte rvention and after holding study drug. In addition, 
[ADDRESS_1234122] with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lu ng who previously had a pneumonectomy enrolled 
on study TED11434 (XL147-002) (erlotinib-SAR245408 combination) and developed rash with eosinophilia; edema of the face, shoulders, and legs; and increasing dyspnea. The patient 
subsequently died. An autopsy showed widespread  carcinomatosis in the remaining lung. The cause 
of death was considered to be malignant neopl asm progression and drug reaction with eosinophilia 
and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Two serious adverse events (SAEs) of pneumonitis possibly related to SAR245408 have been reported, one Grade 2 in combination with trastuzumab and 
paclitaxel and one Grade 4 in comb ination with letrozole; the second patient subsequently died of 
suspected drug-induced pulmonary toxicity. 
Study subjects receiving SAR245408 s hould be closely monitored for: 
• presence of skin rash and DRESS syndrome; 
• liver function abnormalities: AST and ALT, bilirubin elevation; 
• signs of pneumonitis, eg, dyspnea, cough.

 [IP_ADDRESS] SAR245409 treatment 
As of June 2011, for [ADDRESS_1234123] co mmon AEs, regardless of  relatedness to SAR245409, 
reported in ≥10% of subjects across all SAR245409 studies ha ve been gastrointestinal related (such 
as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation); constitutional (such as decreased appetite, fatigue, and asthenia); transaminase elevations (elevations in both AST and ALT have been reported); as well 
as rash, headache, cough, and abdominal pain. The majority of transaminase elevations have been 
Grade 1 or Grade 2, asymptomatic, and not accompanied by a significant drug related increase in bilirubin of Grade ≥ 1. All elevations related to SAR245409 re solved with SAR245409 withdrawal or 
interruption. Various kinds of rash have been  reported with SAR245409, including [ADDRESS_1234124] 
receiving SAR245409 (70 mg once daily) and erlotin ib who had a Grade 3 DRESS syndrome, which 
resolved with drug discontinua tion and supportive care, including intravenous steroid treatments 
followed by [CONTACT_882373][INVESTIGATOR_8826]. 
Periodic ophthalmologic exams are currently be ing performed on SAR245409 studies due to the 
preclinical observation of focal cataracts in two rats dosed orally with SAR245409 for 180 
consecutive days (1 male dosed at 3 mg/kg twice da ily and 1 female dosed at 10 mg/kg twice daily). 
Study subjects receiving SAR245409 s hould be closely monitored for: 
• presence of skin rash and DRESS syndrome; 
• liver function abnormalities: AST and ALT, bilirubin elevation.

recommended Phase 2 dose (400 mg SAR245408 [tablet formulation polymorph A] once a day every 
day or 50 mg SAR245409 [capsule formulation] twice a day every day) or the subject’s established 
dose and formulation either as a monotherapy or in a combination regimen in the parental study.  
When the supply of SAR245408 (form A) hard capsules and SAR245408 (form A) tablets is 
depleted, ongoing patients will be  offered SAR245408 (form E) film-coated tablets in order to 
continue treatment (see Section 8.1.1).    When the sponsor has discontinued manufacture of the SAR245409A [ADDRESS_1234126] capsule strength, 
ongoing patients who are receiving a dose lower than  30 mg may continue treatment at a comparable 
dose level in consultation with the s ponsor.  Patients receiving dose levels ≥30 to ≤ 100 mg (with 10 
mg dose intervals) are not affected by [CONTACT_882374] 10 mg capsule strength (see Section 
8.1.2).     
If in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the subject has maximally benefited from the combination therapy in 
the parental study, the subject may continue on SAR245408 or SAR245409 as a monotherapy in this study. For all subjects, dose, regimen, formula tion, and food condition for study drug intake of 
SAR245408 or SAR245409 (and dose and regimen of combination medication(s) for subjects taking combination therapy) will be agreed on in writing between the site and the Sponsor prior to first dose. 
Subjects who received SAR245408 or SAR245409 for less than 2 cycles in the parental study will 
enter the treatment-extension study on Day 1 of the initiation period; subjects who received 
SAR245408 or SAR245409 for at least [ADDRESS_1234127] ongoing Grade 2 AE(s) will  start the treatment-extension study on Day 1 of 
the initiation period.

 8 STUDY TREATMENTS 
8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
8.1.1 SAR245408 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmaceutical form 
SAR245408 capsules and tablets are used in parental  studies and may be used in this study:  
• SAR245408 (form A) hard capsules: powder-in-caps ule formulation supplied at strengths of 
[ADDRESS_1234138] ge latin capsule. Each strength is 
presented in a different capsule color. 
• SAR245408 (form A) tablets: immediate-release tablet formulation with 50 % w/w API [INVESTIGATOR_882357] , 
supplied at strengths of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg  of drug substance SAR245408 (form A)  
free base . Each strength will be presented in a different tablet shape and/or size. 
• SAR245408 (form E) film-coated tablets: Immediat e-release film-coated tablet with 50% w/w  
drug substance load, supplied at strength of 50 mg or 200 mg (based on the amount of drug 
substance SAR245408 (form E) free base). 
Rationale to transition from SAR245408 (form A) hard capsules and (form A) tablets to 
SAR245408 (form E) film-coated tablets  
When the supply of SAR245408 (form A) hard capsules and SAR245408 (form A) tablets is 
depleted, ongoing subjects will be offered SAR245408 (form E) f ilm-coated tablets in order to 
continue treatment.    
The SAR245408 drug substance used for initial phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, was a single anhydrous 
polymorph (form A). A new anhydrous polymorph (fo rm E) of SAR245408 drug substance was later 
evidenced in development. The form E is thermodynamically more stable than form A. It was 
therefore decided to pursue the SAR245408 developmen t with the drug substance (form E). The drug 
substance (form E) is additionally micronized in order to reach a similar particle size distribution as drug substance (form A) previously used in the first clinical studies. 
In order for subjects to continue treatment, it is n ecessary to transition from drug substance (form A) 
to drug substance (form E).  Subjects must be info rmed of this new information, have the opportunity 
to discuss the transition and alternative treatment options with the Investigator, and document their 
consent to transition to a new formulation via an updated IRB/IEC approved informed consent.

 Transition from SAR245408 (form A) ha rd capsule to SAR245408 (form A tablet)   
Two completed SAR245408 studies pr ovide data to support the tr ansition from SAR245408 (form A) 
hard capsule to (form A) tablet  
1. Study TED11433 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]): SAR245408 (form A) ha rd capsule vs. (form A) tablet  
Study TED11433 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) evaluated the SAR245408 (fo rm A) hard capsule using either an 
intermittent (21 days on, 7 days off) or continuous daily dosing (CDD) treatment schedule.  In 
patients with solid tumors (n=69), dose-limiting toxicities were maculopapular rash and hypersensitivity reaction.  Of note, skin reacti ons are an expected toxicity for SAR245408 and for 
PI3K inhibitors as a class.  The maximum tole rated dose for the SAR245408 (form A) hard capsule 
was 600 mg QD for both schedules.  The recommended phase 2 dose for the SAR245408 (form A) hard capsule was 600 mg administered on a CDD schedule( 1).    
Study TED11433 also included a cohort of patients w ith B-cell malignancies (n=25) treated with 600 
mg QD SAR245408 (form A) hard capsules.  One DLT (grade 3 rash) was reported.  The PK profile 
of SAR245408 in this cohort was c onsistent with the solid tumor cohort who received 600 mg (form 
A) hard capsules once daily. 
An additional 22 patients w ith advanced solid tumors received SAR245408 (form A) tablets at doses 
ranging from 100 to 600 mg QD.  No dose-limiting toxicities were reporte d.  The recommended 
phase 2 dose for SAR245408 (form A) tablet adminis tered on the CDD schedule was determined to 
be 400 mg based on the PK exposure at this dose,  which was similar to the exposure achieved with 
600 mg (form A) hard capsule.  
1. Study ARD11437 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]): SAR245408 (form A) tablet  
Study ARD11437 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a phase 1/ [ADDRESS_1234139] 
cancer, further evaluated the 400 mg (form A) tabl et in combination with letrozole with a CDD 
schedule.  Thirty-one (31) of 37 patients enrolled to receive SAR245408 were treated with the 400 
mg (form A) tablet with 2.5 mg letrozole.  In the Phase 1 portion of the study, one DLT, serious grade 
3 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, was reporte d among the 6 patients enrolled 
at 400 mg QD.  In the Phase 2 portion (n=25), [ADDRESS_1234140] dose of study drug.  The event was consider ed possibly related to study drug and resulted in

Two studies (1 completed [BDR12246] and 1 ongoing [TED12863 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])] provide data to 
support the formulation transition from SAR245408 (form A)  tablet to (form E) film-coated tablet.

 Results of a single (reduced) dose (50 mg) relative bioavailability study in healthy male patients 
indicate the bioavailability of SAR245408 (form E) film-coated tablets relative to SAR245408 (form A) tablets administered as a 50-mg tablet in the fasted state was generally lower based on the point 
estimates for C
max, AUC last, AUC 0-120, and AUC geometric mean ratios, with a decrease in the point 
estimates in the range of 15% to 22%.  A moderate fat meal did not appear to have an appreciable impact on the exposure of SAR245408 (form E).    
2. Study TED12863 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]): SAR245408 (form E) film-coated tablet  
[COMPANY_011] is currently testing the safety, tolerability and pharmacoki netics of SAR245408 (form E) film-
coated tablets in a phase [ADDRESS_1234141] 6 patients enrolled to receive 400 mg QD SAR245408 (form E) film-coated tablets, no dose 
limiting toxicities were observed.  Two patients experienced grade 2 rash assessed as related to study treatment.  In both cases, rash was managed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_298281]. The exposure of 400 mg (form E) film-coated tablets was similar when compared with 400 mg (form A) tablets, as well as with 600 mg (form A) hard capsules on C1D1 and C1D28 or C2D1.  High inter-patient variability 
was observed and consistent with da ta from (form A) hard capsules a nd (form A) tablets in the above 
mentioned Study TED11433. Based on the absence of DLTs in the 400 mg cohort, patients are now 
being enrolled to receive (form E) film coated tabl ets at 600 mg QD. Based on these clinical data, the 
SAR245408 400 mg (form E) film-coated tablet is considered as a safe dose with comparable 
exposure to the 400 mg (form A) tablet. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose preparation and administration 
Subjects will take 400 mg SAR245408 (tablet formul ation polymorph A) once a day every day (ie, 
the recommended SAR245408 Phase 2 dose and regimen). Subjects who are receiving in the parental study an established dose of SAR245408 (tablet pol ymorph A or E) different from 400 mg (tablet 
polymorph A) may continue on the established do se. Subjects who will ta ke a SAR245408 daily dose 
higher than their established dose of SAR245408 in  the parental study and subjects who had dose 
interrupted in the parental study but fulfill parental protocol criteria to restart IMP treatment will enter the study on Day 1 of the initiation period.  
The recommendations for transition of SAR245408 formulation are (see Table 1): 
• Patients taking SAR245408 (form A) hard capsules  at a dose level of 400 mg QD transition to 
200 mg (form A) tablets (as supply permits) or  200 mg (form E) film-coated tablets  
• Patients taking SAR245408 (form A) hard capsules  at a dose level of 600 mg QD transition to 
a dose level of 400 mg using 200 mg (form A) ta blets (as supply permits) or 200 mg (form E) 
film-coated tablets 
• Patients taking SAR245408 (form A) tablets transition to the same dose with SAR245408 
(form E) film-coated tablets

in Section 8.3 .  
The guidelines for treatment delay or dose modification provided in Section 8.3  are applicable 
regardless of formulation.   SAR245408 doses should be taken at approximately the same time each 
day with a full glass (8 fluid ounces or 240 mL) of water. If a dose is missed, the missed dose can be 
taken up to [ADDRESS_1234143] be instructed not to make up

8.[ADDRESS_1234149] signs of toxicity. 
Subjects experiencing one or more AEs due to th e study treatment may require dosing interruptions 
or reductions in their IMP doses in orde r to continue with study treatment.  
Guidelines for the management of AEs a nd SAR245408 and SAR245409 dose modifications (ie, 
dose interruptions and dose reducti ons) are presented in details in Section 8.3.1 and Section 8.3.2. 
Commercially available drug(s) given in combination with SAR245408 or SAR245409 should be 
managed according to the product label and standard of care. 
For SAR245408, each dose reduction should be at least ≥ 25% of the current dose. For a subject dosed 
at [ADDRESS_1234150] requiring more than 
2 dose reductions of SAR245408 - considering both  the parental study and the treatment-extension 
study - (or less than 100 mg SAR245408), or if SAR [ADDRESS_1234151] capsules is depleted, patients requiring dose 
reduction below 30 mg will be offered continuation of treatment at a reduced dose and/or schedule in consultation with the sponsor.  A subject requiring more than 2 dose reductions of SAR245409 - considering both the parental study and the treatment-extension study - (or less than 20 mg 
SAR245409), or if SAR245409 is held for more than [ADDRESS_1234152]’s dose has been reduced, the dose may be re-escalated 1 dose level if the toxicity that 
led to the dose reduction was Grade ≤[ADDRESS_1234153] 4 weeks. Additi onal safety monitoring should be implemented upon 
dose re-escalation.

 However, dose re-escalation is not allowed fo r subjects remaining on study treatment after 
experiencing a Grade 4 AE, regardless of causality, and is only allowed one time for any specific AE 
(Grade ≤3) that led to a dose reduction. 
No dose re-escalation will be permitted for SAR245409 if the dose was reduced for 
transaminase elevations. 
8.3.1 General guidelines for the management of non-hematologic and hematologic adverse 
events 
General guidelines for the management of non-he matologic and hematologi c toxicities are provided 
in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.  
For more specific guidelines on AEs including skin, pulmonary, hepatobiliary, and gastrointestinal disorders, hyperglycemia, and QT interval prolongation, refer to Section 8.3.2 . 
Table 2 - Management guidelines for non-hematologic adverse events 
CTCAE v4.03 Grade Guidelines / Intervention 
Grade 1: No dose adjustments. 
Grade 2:  
Grade 2 AEs that are subjectively 
tolerable Continue SAR245408/SAR245409 at the current dose levels.  
Grade 2 AEs subjectively 
intolerable, or an AE deemed 
unacceptable in the Investigator’s 
judgment Interrupt SAR245408/SAR245409 until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline. Upon 
recovery, resume SAR245408/SAR245409 at the same dose or at a reduced dose as 
clinically indicated. If the dose is not reduc ed after the first occurrence, a dose reduction 
must be implemented after a second recurrence. All SAR245408/SAR245409-related transaminase elevations require dose reduction. 
Grade 3:  
Grade 3 AEs without optimal prophylaxis or are easily managed 
with or without medical 
intervention Interrupt SAR245408/SAR245409 until the AE resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline. Upon 
recovery, resume SAR245408/SAR245409 at the same dose or at a reduced dose as 
clinically indicated. If the dose is not reduc ed after the first occurrence, a dose reduction 
must be implemented after a second recurrence.

 8.3.2 Specific guidelines for the management of adverse events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin disorders 
Prophylactic skin care recommendations for all subjects include sunscreen with SPF ≥30, 
hypoallergenic moisturizing products for dry skin, a nd gentle skin care with fragrance-free soaps and 
detergents. 
Subjects must contact [CONTACT_882377] a new rash or have worsening of 
an existing rash while on study. A complete blood count with differential a nd serum chemistry that 
includes liver function tests should be obtained, and subjects should be  evaluated for any associated 
systemic involvement (cardiac, hepa tic, pulmonary, or renal) at least weekly with either new onset or 
worsening of existing rash.  
It is recommended that a dermatologist be involved in subject management, es pecially for severe or 
life-threatening rash. A skin biopsy for histopathologi cal diagnosis is strongly encouraged, and serial 
digital photographs are recommended (photography guidelines in the study manual).  Photographs 
and biopsy results should be sent to the Sponsor and/or designee. Biopsy samples should be made 
available to the Sponsor and/or design ee for additional evaluation upon request. 
Permanent discontinuation  of study treatment (SAR245408 or SAR245409) will be required for 
subjects who develop a Grade 4 skin AE, Steven s-Johnson syndrome (SJS), or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_7387] (TEN). Additionally, permanent disconti nuation of study treatment is required for subjects 
with study treatment-related skin rash associated with: 
• Grade 3 systemic organ (cardiac, hepatic, pulmona ry, or renal) dysfunc tion (with or without 
eosinophilia)  
• Any of the following symptoms of an  allergic/hypersens itivity reaction:  
- Any grade anaphylaxis, angioedema, or bronchospasm; 
- Grade 2 or greater urticaria (urticarial lesions covering ≥10% of the body surface area 
(BSA), or oral or intravenous (IV) intervention indicated);  
- Grade 3 or greater hypotension (hypotension for which urgent medical intervention or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89648], or is life threatening). 
Note: rash with associated eosinophilia but without a ssociated systemic symptoms is not an absolute 
indication to permanently discontinue study treatm ent. Discussion with the Sponsor is recommended 
in these cases. 
For study treatment-related skin AEs not meeting the above criteria fo r permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment, the following guidelines must be followed regarding dosing of 
SAR245408/SAR245409):

In this study, subjects should be instructed to cont act the Investigator promptly for new or worsening 
unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea or cough. A chest x-ray and/or a high-resolution 
chest CT scan (for higher sensitivity when clinically indicated) should be obtained at the onset of 
clinically significant pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea and cough to assess for interstitial lung disease (ILD). Study treatment (SAR245408 or SAR245409) interruption will be required for 
subjects who develop clinically significant pu lmonary symptoms. Subjects with pulmonary AEs 
should be monitored closely as c linically indicated (eg, by [CONTACT_882378] t x-ray, high-resolution CT scan, 
and/or pulmonary function tests (eg, measuring th e diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide [DLCO]). 
Permanent discontinuation of the study drug will be required for subjects who have symptomatic and radiographic evidence of ILD.

9.1 SAFETY 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety and tolerability of 
SAR245408 and SAR245409 as a monotherapy or as part of a combination regimen in subjects who are benefiting from treatment. Safety is thus the primary study endpoint  and will be assessed 
continuously. 
The safety profile will be assessed from the fi ndings of physical examination, vital signs 
measurement, laboratory data , ECGs, ophthalmologic assessments , concomitant me dications and 
treatments, and date of study tr eatment withdrawal and cause.  
The safety profile will be based on incidence, severity (as graded by [CONTACT_204801] v4.03 [NCI CTCAE v4.03]) (see Appendix B ), 
and cumulative nature of AEs. Adverse event seri ousness, severity grade, and relationship to IMP 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]. 
Serious adverse events, pregnancy and symptomatic overdose must be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours (see Section 10.5.2 ). 
The general and study-specific safety assessmen ts/evaluations are described in details in Section 10.1 . 
Additional safety assessme nts/evaluations for the subjects on a combination regimen will be done per 
standard of care.

10.1 SAFETY ENDPOINTS ASSESSED IN THIS TRIAL 
The safety profile will be assessed from the fi ndings of physical examination, vital signs 
measurement, laboratory data , ECGs, ophthalmologic assessments , concomitant me dications and 
treatments, and date of study treatment withdrawal and cause. 
The safety profile will be based on incidence, severity (as graded by [CONTACT_315092] v4.03; see 
Appendix B ), and cumulative nature of AEs. Adverse event seriousness, severity grade, and 
relationship to IMP will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]. 
10.1.1 Performance status 
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scale (see Appendix A ) will 
be used to assess performance status. 
Please refer to the study flow chart in Section 1.2  for performance status assessment schedule. 
10.1.2 Physical examination 
Full physical examination consists of examinatio n of major body systems (including neurologic, 
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], skin, and lymphatics), body weight, and height (at 
baseline visit only). 
Symptom-directed physical examination is a physical examination relevant to the subject’s 
symptoms.  
If abnormal findings emerge or worsen from baseli ne assessment, then the AE page of the e-CRF 
should be completed for these findings. If a fi nding meets the criteria for an SAE, then the 
appropriate procedures for re porting such events should be followed as described in Section 10.[ADDRESS_1234175] of body temperature, blood pres sure, and heart rate. Vita l signs should be taken 
within 1 hour before dosing. Please refer to the study flow chart in Section 1.2   for vital signs measurement schedule.

rapid communication by [CONTACT_78784]. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize a nd understand them and may require follow-up beyond 
the planned time of study completion. 
10.5 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.5.1 General guidelines for reporting Adverse Events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relations hip to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the first dose 
of IMP in the study until the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_12546], are to 
be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) of e-CRF. 
• For continuity of evaluation of safety through the parental and treatment-extension studies, for 
each subject that may have an AE or SAE in the treatment-extension study, the parental study number, subject ID in the parental study and a specific designation for the parental study will be collected as mandatory fields on the corres ponding screen(s) of e-CRF of the treatment-
extension study. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset , intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, 
corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome and his/her 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable po ssibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_2203]. 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all trea tment related AEs and 
SAEs until clinical recovery is complete, laboratory results have returned to patient’s baseline level or until stabilization or death, in order to ensure the safety of the subjects. This may imply that observations will continue beyond th e last planned visit pe r protocol, and that  
Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 2  16-Jun-2014 
TED12414  Version number: 1  
 
Property of sanofi-aventis - strictly confidential Page 53 
 additional investigations may be  requested by [CONTACT_882383]. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the subject’s observations will continue until the 
end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_12546]. 
• Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic, and/or  
- Requiring either corrective treatment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI. 
• See Table [ADDRESS_1234183] immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to  the SAE in the appropriate screens of the 
e-CRF; the system will automatically send the notification to the Monitoring Team after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND  (preferably by [CONTACT_3719] e-mail) the photoc opy of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the Monitoring 
Team whose name, fax number and email address appear on the clinical trial protocol. Care 
should be taken to ensure that the subject's iden tity is protected and the subject's identifiers in 
the Clinical Trial are properly mentioned on any copy of source document provided to the 
Sponsor. For laboratory results, incl ude the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional informa tion (for Lab data, c oncomitant Medication, 
subject status ...) should be sent (by [CONTACT_3719] e-mail) to the Monitoring Team within 24 hours of 
knowledge. In addition, any effort should be made to further document each Serious AE that 
is fatal or life threatening within the week (7 days) following initial notification. 
• A back-up plan is available and should be used  (using paper CRF process) when the e-CRF 
system does not work. 
• In case of any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the subject and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her to be caused by [CONTACT_56486] a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the Monitoring team. 
• Any SAE occurring within [ADDRESS_1234184] be reported within 24 hours.

 11 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT 
TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY 
DISCONTINUATION 
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be determined 
if the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the subject should remain in 
the study as long as possible. 
Pregnancy will lead to definitive study treatment discontinuation in all cases. 
11.[ADDRESS_1234187](S) 
Please refer to Section 8.3. 
All temporary treatment discontinuation, whatever the duration, should be recorded by [CONTACT_882384](s) of the e-CRF. 
11.[ADDRESS_1234188](S) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any treatment discontinuation associated with the definitive 
decision from the Investigator or the subject not to re-expose the subject to the IMP at any time. 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1234189] of criteria for definitive treatment discontinuation 
The subjects may withdraw from treatment with IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Treatment with IMP should be definitively discontinued in any of the following cases: 
• Unacceptable AE (including AE requiring mo re than 2 dose reductions of SAR245408 or 
SAR245409 - considering both the parental study and the treatment-extension study - or 
interruption of SAR245408 for more than 6 w eeks, or interruption of SAR245409 for more 
than 21 days);   
• Disease progression; 
• Poor compliance to the study protocol; 
• Loss of follow-up;

 11.2.2 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Subjects will be followed up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to the 
Day 23-37 follow-up visit (see  Section 1.2 ), or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol, whiche ver comes last. 
All permanent treatment discontinua tion should be recorded by [CONTACT_882385] e-CRF when considered as confirmed. 
11.3 PROCEDURE AND CONSEQUENCE FOR PATIENT WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY  
The subjects may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason: 
• All study withdrawals should be recorded by [CONTACT_882386] 
e-CRF and in the subject’s medical records when considered as confirmed (at least date of withdrawal and reason for). 
• If possible, the subjects are assessed using th e procedures normally planned for the Day 23-37 
follow-up visit (see Section 1.2). 
For subjects who fail to return to the site, the Inve stigator should make the best effort to re-contact 
[CONTACT_423] (eg, contact[CONTACT_882387]’s family or private physician, review available registries or health 
care database), and to determine his/ her health status, including at le ast his/her vital status. Attempts 
to contact [CONTACT_449368]’s records (eg, times and dates of 
attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). The statistical analysis plan will 
specify how these subjects lost to follow-up for their primary endpoint s will be considered. 
Subjects who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re-treated in the st udy. Their inclusion and 
treatment number must not be reused.

 13.5.5 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
This treatment-extension study is for investigating the long term safety and tolerability of 
SAR245408 and SAR245409 as a monotherapy or as part  of a combination regimen, and thus there is 
no primary or secondary efficacy endpoint. All the efficacy variable s and analyses are exploratory. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints 
Tumor response as per Investigator will be  summarized by [CONTACT_1570] (SAR245408 and 
SAR245409) in the evaluable population. Overall Surv ival (OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS), 
Objective Response Rate (ORR), and Duration of Response (DR) will be summarized and the 
survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates by [CONTACT_1570]. Tumor response 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_882394]. 
Overall survival is defined as the time (days) from the study Day 1 of the parental study to the date of 
death (whatever the cause) in the study (treatment -extension study). If death is not observed during 
the study, data on OS will be censored at the last da te subject is known to be alive or the cut-off date 
(if defined during the study), whichever occurs first. 
Progression free survival is defined as the time (days) from the study Day 1 of the parental study to 
the date of progressive disease (PD) or death (re gardless of cause) in the study (treatment-extension 
study). The actual dates of tumor assessments will be  used for this calculati on. If death or disease 
progression is not observed, data on PFS will be censored at the earlier of the date of last tumor assessment without evidence of progression.  
Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who experience complete 
response/remission (CR) or partial response/remission (PR) in th e study (treatment-extension study). 
Duration of response is defined as the time (days) fro m the date of first tumor response (CR or PR) in 
the parental study or in the study (treatment-extension study), whichever occurs first, to the time of 
the first tumor assessment of PD or death due to any cause. This endpoint is defined only for those subjects with a tumor response. 
Subgroup efficacy analyses will be performed by  [CONTACT_882393], monotherapy and combination 
therapy, when appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity Considerations 
Due to the nature of the exploratory analyses, no adjustment for multiple efficacy analyses will be 
made.

13.6 DATA HANDLING CONVENTIONS 
Missing dates will be handled using conservative approaches, and no imputation will be applied at the 
data level: 
• If the date of the last dose of IMP is mi ssing, the exposition duration should be kept as 
missing. 
• If a medication date is missi ng or partially missing, it will be considered as a prior, 
concomitant, and a follow-up medi cation, when no reasonable c onclusion can be reached in 
this situation. 
• If onset dates are missing or partially missing, the AE will be classified as treatment-
emergent. 
• If the date of the first study drug dose in the st udy is missing, all AEs that occurred on or after 
the day the subject entered into the study will be considered as treatment-emergent AEs. 
Handling of missing relationship to IMPs of AEs: if the assessment of the relationship to IMPs is 
missing, then the relationship to IMPs has to be assumed and the AE considered as such in the 
frequency tables of possibly-related AEs. 
Handling of missing severity/grades of AEs: if the severity/grade is missing for 1 of the treatment-
emergent occurrences of an AE, the maximal severity on the remaining occurrences will be 
considered. If the severity is missing for all the occurrences a “missing” category will be added in the summary table.

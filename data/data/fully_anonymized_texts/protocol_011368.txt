E. Laboratory & Clinical Data  
 In a 26 week animal study using a single level bilateral rabbit posterolateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_834985], nanOss Bioactive 3D+autograft+BMA produced the same results as those seen in the rabbits that received auto graft+BMA (control).  Micro -computed tomography evaluation at 12 and 26 weeks 
found that both groups demonstrated new bone formation along the transverse -processes and in 
the middle of the fusion mass with extensive bone remodeling at the treated level.  T he study 
also included a group of animals that received Vitoss BA+BMA.  After 26 weeks, the Vitoss group demonstrated new bone formation only on the transverse -processes (not in the middle of 
the fusion site) with minimal graft remodeling at the treated le vel.

 There are several surgical approaches available to achieve a solid union; however PLF is one of the most common techniques used in spi[INVESTIGATOR_61680].
L  Bone graft material obtained from the iliac 
crest is recognized as the “gold standard ” against which all other graft materials are compared.  
However, several complications have been associated with the use of autogenous bone graft such as increased blood loss, donor site pain, increased operative time, risks of nerve injury, additional incision sites, and insufficient quantity of bone available to harvest from the donor site.   
 Considerable efforts have been expended to develop synthetic bone graft materials as replacements for iliac crest bone graft or to produce materials that extend au tograft when the 
supply is limited.  Developmental challenges surround the production of a synthetic material that maintains both the osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of autograft.  nanOss Bioactive, an FDA cleared  bone void filler, contains 2 primary components: nanocrystalline 
hydroxyapatite providing an osteoconductive matrix and a collagen -based bioscaffold carrier, to 
form an adhesive and cohesive paste.
M  nanOss Bioactive is indicated to be gently packed into 
bony voids or gaps in the pos terolateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_834997].  
BMA and autograft are osteoinductive and, when combined with nanOss Bioactive, they form a cohesive and adhesive implant with a putty -like consistency . 
 nanOss Bioactive 3D is also FDA cleared  for use in the posterolateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].
  It is an 
osteoconductive implant with an interconnected porosity similar to human cancellous bone. The product is a semi -rigid three dimensional construct that consists of porous hydroxyapatite  
granules suspended within porous gelatin- based foam matrix. When hydrated with BMA and 
used with autograft, nanOss Bioactive 3D becomes a compressible and elastic sponge that allows the shape of the implant to conform to the defect maximizing direct conta ct with viable host 
bone.

X. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
 
 
A. Purpose  
 nanOss Bioactive 3D has recently been cleared  for use in the U.S., however, additional 
information is useful  to assess its efficacy and gather information about its use and fusion results 
in the posterolateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
 The purpose of the Study is to assess fusion results in the posterolateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_835000] 3D mixed with autograft bone and BMA.   
B. Objective  
 The objective of the Study is to gather information about fusion results, clinical & radiographic outcomes, complications/adverse events and patient reported outcomes in patients treated with nanOss Bioactive 3D mixed with autograft bone and BMA.  The results of nanOss Bioactive 3D will be compared to those cited in literature.

Bioactive 3D mixed with BMA and autograft in their posterolateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_835001].   
 Clinic procedures will be related to standard of care for persons receiving treatment for posterior lumbar fusion surgery.  Information from clinical notes, examinations, questionnaire s, results of 
diagnostic tools, radiographs, tests and exams will be recorded for the Study at the following 
timepoints:   
 
• Pre-Operative  
• Surgery 
• Discharge  
• [ADDRESS_1159602] -Operative  
• [ADDRESS_1159603] -Operative 
• [ADDRESS_1159604] -operatively  based on the following criteria:  
 
• Presence of bridging trabecular bone; and  
• < 5° Angular motion;  and 
• < 3 mm Translational motion.  
 Secondary evaluation parameters include:  
 
1. The proportion of successfully fused treated segments [ADDRESS_1159605] Market Study  # NB3D012012 Amendment [ADDRESS_1159606] instrumented PLF surgery  between L2 and S1 and which meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria listed below.  
 
 
B. Number of Participants and Study Sites  
 Up to 60 participants may be enrolled in the Study from no more than 10 participating sites.  
 A maximum of 15 smokers may be enrolled in the Study.   
 
• All inclusion criteria must be met and no exclusion criteria can be met.   
• Verification with the Sponsor is required before enrolling a smoker in the Study.  
• A Study Site may enroll no more than 5 smokers , unless approved by [CONTACT_1034] .   
• This cohort of patients will be identified and analyzed separately.   
  
C. Recruitment of Participants  
 It is estimated that there will be [ADDRESS_1159607] 1 participant within 30 days of activation  and may enroll no more than 15 participants , unless approved by [CONTACT_1034] .  Each 
Study Site will be permitted a maximum of 1 year (from activation) to enroll their participants.  Once open to enrollment, a Study Site must have consistent enrollment (or documentation of screen failures)  each [ADDRESS_1159608] 
of site activity.  
 Surgeons are expected to meet the enrollment goals contained in the CSA.  If enrollment goals are not met for 3 consecutive months, the Study Site will be closed and may be replaced by [CONTACT_835056]  (as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034]) .     
 The Sponsor will permit in -office flyers

XIV. COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Safety assessment involves assessment of the complications, including subsequent surgical interventions and pain and neurological complication information. Pain, neurological and function symptoms should be considered complications when a patient’s complaint for any of these symptoms results in an unscheduled visit or when a patient presents with new or worsening pain, neurological, and/or function symptoms as compared to the previous visit . 
 All non- serious operative and post -operative  complications , whether or not they are related to the 
device,  including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, symptoms, physical signs, 
or diseases which occur during participation in the Study t hat were not present at the baseline 
evaluation, or were present at baseline but have worsened, are to be recorded by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_835026] . 
 
• These should be reported to the Sponsor no later than ten working days after the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_54813] .  
• This should be reported on the Complication/Adverse Event  CRF.  
 Any serious and  unanticipated  serious adverse device events  that have at least a possible 
relationship to nanOss Bioactive 3D  are to be recorded on the Complication/Adverse Event CRF 
and reported to the Sponsor .   
 
• These should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_835027].    
• The Sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation of the events.  
 The Sponsor will ensure that  the event is documented by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_835028].  The Sponsor has internal advisory boards composed of physicians that 
are available for questions and review of such events.  
 
• A serious adverse event (SAE) is an anticipated AE that falls into one of the following 
categories: (a) death, (b) life- threatening adverse experience, (c) inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81889], (d) persistent or significant disabili ty/incapacity, (e) 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, (f) important medical event that may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical intervention to prevent an outcome listed in a -e 
above, or (g) any AE associated with the use of nanOss Bioactive 3D , the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the risk information provided.  
• An unanticipated serious adverse device effect (U SADE) is an unanticipated serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, nanOss Bioactive 3D, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with nanOss Bioactive 3D that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants.

XV. INDEPENDENT RADIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
 
 
A. Quantitative Measur ements  
 
Quantitative measurements (angular and translational motion) will be produced by [CONTACT_835058] (QMA®, Medical Metrics, Inc.).  The 
software is US FDA 510(k) cleared and has been validated to produce assessments of interver tebral motion accurate to less than 1 degree and 1 mm (Zhao et al, J Biomech  2005; 
Reitman et al, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  2004).  The reproducibility of the measurements has also been validated 
(Pearson et al, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  2011).   
 The measurements will be produced from flexion- extension views at the treated segment s 6, 12 
and 24 (as applicable) months  postoperatively : 
 
• Angular Motion (in units of degrees) : Rotation of the superior vertebra relative to the 
inferior vertebra.  Angular Motion will be measured in the sagittal plane from flexion -
extension films.   
• Translational Motion (in units of mm) : Displacement of the posterior -inferior corner of 
the superior vertebra in a direction defined parallel to the superior endplate of the inferior vertebra.  Translational Motion wi ll be measured in the sagittal plane from lateral flexion -
extension films.   
  
B. Qualitative Measur ements  
 
Qualitative assessments shall be performed by a single, independent radiographic reviewer that is 
board- certified, fellowship -trained, practicing neuro - or musculoskeletal  radiologist.  The 
following qualitative assessments shall be performed by a single, independent radiographic reviewer.  The reviewer shall be a board -certified, fellowship -trained, practicing neuro - or 
musculoskeletal radiologist.   
 The qualitative assess ments shall be conducted at the treated segment s 6, 12 and 24 (as 
applicable) months postoperatively : 
 
• Left & Right Posterolateral Bridging: X -rays as well as axial, coronal and sagittal CT 
reconstructions, when available, will be used to determine the presence of bridging.  Assessment of bridging bone across the left and right posterolateral gutter, facet joint and/or transverse processes.  Each treated segment  will be graded separately.  
Posterolateral Bridging will be graded for each  side (left and right) separately, and will 
include the entire posterolateral gutter, from the lateral- most aspect of the transverse 
processes to the medial -most aspects of the facet joints. Bridging between facet joints, 
between transverse processes, or between facet joint and transverse process will all be considered acceptable forms of bridging.  
• Interbody Bridging: X -rays as well as axial, coronal and sagittal CT reconstructions,

[ADDRESS_326955] 2002 study is a prospective, multi -site, two -arm cluster  (site) -randomized study of the efficacy 
of a health and wellness cogniti ve-behavioral intervention (H&W CBT) and medication management 
(COMB -R) for depression in youth with HIV compared to enhanced standard care (ESC). The study 
population are HIV-infected youth in the U.S., who are between 12 and 24 years old (inclusive), and  who 
have been diagnosed with moderate to severe depression reflected by  a QIDS -C score of ≥11. Youth 
enrolled in the study attend a Screening/Entry Visit and study visits at Weeks 1, 6, 12, and 24. 
Participants are encouraged to attend all clinically indi cated i nterim visits through the first [ADDRESS_326956] sites were randomly assigned to either the COMB -R group or the ESC 
group. Randomization of sites was chosen due to the potential contamination that could occur if same site 
clinicians were delivering both ESC and COMB -R. A pre -study survey ascertained broadly defined site 
characteristics, namely, the number of youth served and whether youth were primarily behaviorally or 
perinatally infected with HIV. A follow -up pre -randomization s urvey  queried sites for more spec ific 
characteristics of potential study participant, which included gender, age (12 -18 versus 19 -24 years of 
age), viral suppression status (below versus not below the level of detection as defined by [CONTACT_25699]), 
transmission routes (perinatal versus behavioral HIV acquisition), and initial levels of depression 
(moderate vs. severe). A restricted randomization procedure was used to assign sites to the two study 
arms in a way that balanced these characteristics across arms. However, after randomization,  one site 
assigned to the COMB -R treatment arm withdrew from the study. Thus the final randomization included 
seven sites assigned to ESC and six to COMB -R, for a total of [ADDRESS_326957] 2002 Analysis Plan   September 27, 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 22 not go to a new block of participants until all participants in the prior block had been approached and a 
decision reached as to study participation.  Participants within a specific block could be approached in any 
order.  Sites c ould continue to periodically submit new lists of potential participants, which include d re-
approaching potential participants who initially had failed to enroll .  A screening failur es form was 
completed for each study participant who was approached but did not enroll. Data on a limited number of 
characteristics (gender, age group, viral suppression status, transmission routes, and initial  levels of 
depression) were gathered for those  participants who failed to enroll, but only if they had initially 
consented to enroll. In addition, reasons for screening failures were collected for those participants who 
had initially consented. .  
A letter of amendment (LOA#1), dated April 27, 2018, re moved the requirement to follow a predefined 
random ordering for approaching participants. After LOA#[ADDRESS_326958] a screening number. Once approached, if the participant chose not 
to enr oll, a screening failures form was completed as noted above. Appendix 2 indicates the date at which 
time the LOA#1 was approved at each site and the requirement for block -random ordering approach 
removed. Resolution of screening numbers for participants wh o had been block -randomized but not yet 
approached at the time the site implemented LOA#1 is described below.  
4.2 Hypotheses  
 Participants receiving COMB -R will demonstrate improved depression outcomes (e.g., decreased 
depressive symptoms, and greater remission and response rates) compared to participants 
receiving ESC.  
 Participants receiving COMB -R will demonstrate improved medical outcomes (e.g., increased 
CD4 T -cell count, decreased HIV RNA level) compared to participants receiving ESC.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 22 4.6 Key Eligibility Criteria  
Eligibility criteria include being 12 -24 years (inclusive), having documented HIV infection and being aware 
of their infection status. Participants have a primary diagnosis of nonpsychotic depression as defined by 
[CONTACT_2681] -IV or DSM -V criteria and their current depressive symptoms warrant intervention as determined by a 
score of 11 or greater on the c linician version of the Quick inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 
(QIDS -C). Participants must be able to communicate in spoken and written English.  
Key exclusionary criteria include having severe or moderate alcohol or substance use problems, having 
depression or suicidal ideation that may require more intensive treatment than the study provides and not 
wishing to switch providers to one trained on study material.  
4.7 Visit and Evaluation Schedule  
Participants at every COMB -R and ESC assigned site will atten d a Screening/Entry Visit, and follow -up 
clinic visits at Weeks 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48. In addition, participants in the COMB -R sites will be 
encouraged to return to the clinic for weekly therapy visits through Week 8, every other week through 
Week 16, a nd then monthly until Week 24. These visits are not mandatory, and will be considered and 
documented as interim visits. At these interim visits, study staff will conduct therapy utilizing the CBT 
manual and provide medication management utilizing the MM ma nual, as indicated. Participants in the 
ESC sites will likewise return to the clinic for interim visits, based on the clinical indication of the 
participant.  
4.[ADDRESS_326963] be completed if the Week 1 study visit occur red on the 
same day as the Screen/Entry visit and to specify use of Version 2.1 of the Division of AIDS Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events.  The protocol team roster was also updated.  
As noted above, a  letter of amendment (LOA #1) was implemented on April 27, 2018, which removed the 
requirement to appr oach participants in a pre -defined block -randomized order  once sites received IRB 
approval . 
Prior to enrolling participants, each site had to obtain a screening number for each pot ential participant.  At 
each site, prior to approval of LOA#1, t hese screening numbers were then randomly ordered in blocks of 
IMPAACT [ADDRESS_326964] participant was enrolled on  March 6, 2017.   
After  approval for LOA#1, the requirement for site-specific block -randomization was removed.  Dates of 
implementation of LOA#1 by [CONTACT_268703] 2. Screening numbers for participants who were 
block -randomized but had not yet been approached at the implementation of LOA#1 were resolved  with a 
screening failure form indicating refusal of consent. In order to  distinguish these screening failures from 
those participants who were actually approached but either refused consent or failed screening, data 
managers also entered a comment field corresponding to each screening number, with an indication that 
resolution was due to the implementation of LOA#1.  
4.[ADDRESS_326965] are monitored through a combination of reports, including monthly accrual 
reports and quarterly monitoring reports, which include data on imbalance in characteristics between 
study arms, baseline characteristics, study status, visit and form completion, data availability and 
treatment implementation fidelity.  Safety (diagnoses, new post -baseline grade  3 and hig her adverse 
events, psychological hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268702]) will also be monitored.  Study conduct and 
safety are also  monitored through annual Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) reviews.  If either safety 
trigger (defined below) is met, the SMC d etermine s whether to convene an ad hoc  review of participant 
safety.  In addition to these reviews , in order to verify assumptions underlying the study design,  an interim 
analysis of the intraclass correlation of the primary study outcome (QIDS -SR ACASI wee k 0 score) was 
carried out  as described below.  
4.9.1  Accrual  
Accrual is monitored monthly. It was expected that full accrual to the study would take two years.  At the 
time of this plan revision, the study has completed the target accrual (N=156) and done so within 
approximately two years of the date the first participant was accrued: the first and last participants were  
enrolled in March 2017 and March 2019, respectively.  
4.9.2  Randomization properties: Monitorin g for imbalance between study arms  
During enrollment, the core protocol team monitor s the balance of the selected  characteristics between 
arms quarterly or as needed (blinded to which arm is which), and if an imbalance greater than the 
maximum allowable im balance is identified, may impose enrollment limits in the DMC enrollment system 
for all sites in one arm or the other to force subsequent enrollments to be from a specific category of age 
IMPAACT 2002 Analysis Plan   September 27, 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 22 (<18 years or > 18 years), gender (male or female) , HIV acquisition  route (perinatal or behavioral) ,  
depression level (moderate or severe) or viral suppression (suppressed or not suppressed), as needed, 
to achieve approximate  balance of these characteristics in the two study arms.  See next section on SMC 
History for a r eview of imbalance criterion.  
4.10 SMC History  
The study had an initial SMC review on September 30, 2016 prior to study opening to accrual. It was 
suggested we include safety triggers in the monitoring plan and also track screening failure reasons for 
potential  causes of concern at individual sites. A second SMC review was performed on July 14, 2017, 
with the primary goal of reviewing accrual and randomization. Subsequent SMC reviews were performed 
on December 15, 2017; June 1, 2018 , December 21, 2018  and in lat e June 2019 . Also see below for the 
SMC’s review of safety data.  
4.10.1  Review of imbalance criterion  
The imbalance criterion was initially set to a group difference of 25%. After the SMC review of June 2018, 
due to concerns about the imbalance in level of depres sion nearing the criterion, the study team was 
asked to review how imbalance in depression was assessed and to develop a plan for further monitoring. 
The study team thereafter proposed evaluating depression levels based on the structured QIDS -C 
(Clinician)  report at screening/entry rather than the unstructured judgement recorded on the eligibility 
checklist. At the same time, the study team proposed reducing the criterion for imbalance to 20%. As of 
the date of this report, balance has been maintained.  
5 Safety 
As noted above in Section 4.9, safety endpoints (significant diagnoses, new post -baseline grade 3 or 
higher adverse events, psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268702]) are monitored quarterly and if 
safety triggers, as defined below, are met, th e SMC can decide whether to convene additional reviews.  
5.1 Safety Triggers  
Either of the following constitutes a safety trigger:  
 Percent of participants (of those enrolled) who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a psychiatric indication or who 
attempt suicide exceeds 5%;;  
 Two or more participants at a given site are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a psychiatric indication or attempt 
suicide.  
Through routine m onitoring, the Protocol Team determined that the safety trigger had been met in May 
2018. The SMC reviewed these data and was kept informed of additional safety events contributing to the 
assessment of the safety trigger.  
IMPAACT 2002 Analysis Plan   September 27, 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 22 6 Interim Analysis  
An interim analys is was planned  either (a) once at least five participants at each site have completed 
Week 0 or (b) [ADDRESS_326966]. The purpose of the 
interim analysis was to estimate the magnitude of the intracluster c orrelation (ICC) of the QIDS -SR ACASI 
score in order to validate the sample size computations. If this analysis showed that  the estimated ICC 
was larger than 0.15 (the largest value for which the selected sample size provides 80% power), the 
protocol team would assess whether to increase the number of participants to be enrolled, to ensure 
adequate statistical power for the primary study objective.   
The plan was to estimate t he ICC of the QIDS -SR ACASI score using mixed models regression methods 
based on week 0 data. With this estimate, a revised sample size computation based on 80% power would 
be completed . The power of our design also would be re-assessed, given the computed ICC and the 
current target sample size.  
This pre-planned interim analysis took place in October, 2018 . The report concluded that, “even having 
lost one site from the initial design, and having a second site with minimal enrollment, with the current 
target sample size of N=156, we wo uld still have 80% power were we to accrue an average of 10 
evaluable participants per each of the 12 remaining sites given the observed intracluster correlation and 
allowing for a 20% non -evaluability rate.”  Based on these results, t he core study team ma de the decision 
not to alter the sample size target.  
7 Statistical Considerations  
7.1 Participant characteristics  
Participant  characteristics (gender, age, mode of transmission, severity of depression, CD4 and RNA 
levels and viral suppression status)  at study e ntry will be summarized  and compared between  treatment 
arms  using clustered measures  appropriate for categorical (number, percent) and continuous  (mean, 
standard deviation or median, 25th and 75th percentiles ) outcomes . We will also note whether sites 
allowed parental waivers of consents.   
7.2 Primary Analysis  (Primary study objectives)  
The primary analyses of the primary study objectives are planned as cluster -level analyses, where the 
unit of analysis is the site . Although this method does not use all the information in the data, this method 
is recommended when there are fewer than 15 -20 clusters per group because individual -level analyses 
do not appear to perform robustly with small numbers of clusters (1). The cluster -level analyses will 
involve a two -stage procedure. The first stage will calculate a summary measure for each site – the mean 
for continuous outcome measures (QIDS -SR, CD4 count) and the prop ortion for dichotomous outcomes 
(response to treatment, remission, undetectable plasma HIV RNA). The second stage will perform a two -
IMPAACT [ADDRESS_326967] (with two -sided alpha =0.05) on the site -specific summary measures. Note that the alpha 
level will not be adj usted for multiple comparisons because the Week [ADDRESS_326968] may not be as clinically meaningful.  For the measures of depression outcomes  at week 24 
only the ACASI interview data will be used in the primary analysis.  
7.3 Supplementary Analyses  (Primary study objectives)  
The following supplementary  and exploratory  analyses  of primary study objectives  will be carried out  as 
appropriate . 
7.3.[ADDRESS_326969] 
(based on all the permissible allocations that were generated for the site randomization) will be performed 
to supplement the primary analysis.  
7.3.2  Time -oriented analyses  
Secondary analyses that incorporate  information from earlier time points  (study e ntry, weeks  1, 6, and 12) 
as well as week 24 will also be conducted to supplement the results of the primary analyses . If ACASI 
data are not available for these time points (e.g.,  at weeks 1, 6 and 12 , participants in the COMB -R group 
only completed the QIDS -SR on paper) , data from the paper forms will be acceptable for analysis. The 
study team developed an algorithm to define the participant’s baseline QIDS -SR value which prioritized 
ACASI data  at week 0 . Refer to the Analysis Implement ation Plan ( AIP) for details. The time-oriented 
analyses will include cross -sectional summaries at each time point, with either a non -parametric cluster -
level comparison at each time point or the non -parametric Wei -Johnson test for change over time 
between  groups. As noted above, cluster -level analyses are robust to departures from assumptions, but 
do not use all the information in the data, since the outcomes are measured at the individual participant 
level.  
IMPAACT 2002 Analysis Plan   September 27, 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 22 7.3.3  Individual -level analyses  
Secondary analyses of  the primary outcome measures will be conducted using individual -level regression 
methods, including mixed -effects linear regression models for continuous outcomes and generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) models for dichotomous outcomes, to supplement th e primary cluster -level 
analyses  for week 24 outcomes .  These  regression models also will be used to evaluate the influence of 
the COMB -R intervention  on QIDS -SR trajectories over time. Such analyses  can use all available 
outcome data, even for those parti cipants with data missing for some time  points.  
7.3.4  Selection bias  
To assess the potential for selection bias, the numbers and characteristics (gender, age, mode of 
transmission, severity of depression, and viral suppression status) of participants screening b ut not 
enrolling in the study will also be compared between treatment groups, and the characteristics of 
participants enrolling vs. not enrolling will be compared overall and within treatment arms as well.  These  
comparisons are limited by [CONTACT_268704] a were only collected for those participants who first 
consented to enroll.  To assess potential selection bias after  the implementation of LOA#1, we will 
compare characteristics of participants enrolled before and after implementation of LOA#1, overall and  
within treatment arm.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_326970] the ability of the study to answer its primary objective, i.e. power may be reduced and the 
interpret ation of any difference between randomized arms may be complicated by [CONTACT_268705] -up, particularly if this also differs between 
randomized arms. Allowance for a loss to follow -up rate of up to 10% prior to Week 24 was built into the 
initial sample size/power considerations for the study, and the protocol (Schema and Section 9.5.1) 
specifies that the sample size may be increased if the loss -to-follow -up rate exceeds 10%. At the time of 
the interim analysis, the loss -to-follow -up rate at Week 24 was between 11% and 15% , depending on 
definition of visit windows ; As such , in the revised power computations, non -evaluability rates up to 20% 
were considered.  The study team chose not to alter the t arget sample size of N=156.  
If more than 10% of participants are lost to follow -up before Week 24, or if a larger proportion of 
participants are lost to follow up in one arm (especially if the loss is due to serious adverse events, or 
suicide attempts), se veral analyses will be undertaken to explore the potential effects of loss to follow -up 
on the conclusions of the study, The characteristics at study entry (gender, age, mode of transmission, 
severity of depression and viral load suppression status) for pa rticipants who discontinued from the study 
before Week [ADDRESS_326971] of missing data on the conclusions 
of the primary efficacy analyses. Of primary concern are missing QIDS -SR scores at Week  24 for 
participants who had low or decreasing QIDS -SR scores at time points before Week 24. The pattern of 
missing data will be described. The sensitivity analyses will be done in two ways: (a) as an extreme, by 
[CONTACT_268706] -SR scores at Week 24 so as to minimize the difference between randomized 
groups (e.g., if the primary efficacy analysis among participants with available Week 24 QIDS -SR score 
suggests that COMB -R is better than ESC, impute a high (worse) Week [ADDRESS_326972] a Week 24 QIDS -SR score, and impute a low (better) Week [ADDRESS_326973] a Week 24 QIDS -SR score ; and (b) more plausibly, by 
[CONTACT_268706] -SR scores at Week 24 by [CONTACT_268707] n of the Week 24 QIDS -SR 
scores for participants in that treatment arm who also had similar QIDS -SR scores at earlier time points . 
In instances where similar patterns of earlier scores do not occur, we will consider imput ing the mean 
values at week 24 for those participants with similar baseline values.  Alternatively, rather than imputing 
the mean value, we could draw a value at random from the distribution of values for participants with 
similar patterns of missing data (or similar baseline values).  Use o f multiple imputation procedures will 
also be considered.  The interpretation will need to be more cautious if the results of these analyses 
suggest different conclusions.

the primary (week 24) data analysis.  
7.4.1  Adherence  
Adherence to both HIV and depression medication and depressio n counseling sessions will be assessed 
as continuous and categorical measures. For example, adherence to HIV medications will be 
dichotomized based on the data distribution of the number of days when doses were missed. Likert 
scales for self -reports of adh erence frequency (how often did you take your medications the way you 
were supposed to?) and efficacy (how good a job did you do at taking your medications?) will be 
IMPAACT [ADDRESS_326975] completed an ACASI questionnaire at those time points . The stud y team developed an algorithm to 
define the participant’s baseline QIDS -SR value which prioritized week [ADDRESS_326976] mo dification will be 
performed using cluster -level methods and also using individual level regression methods (because 
cluster -level methods do not use all the information in the data). Each approach is described in turn 
below.  Preliminary analyses will be c ompleted at the time of the week 24 data analysis while final 
analyses will be completed once week 48 data are in the database  and prepared for analysis . 
In the cluster -level analyses, adjustment for baseline covariates (e.g., the QIDS -SR score at entry) w ill be 
done by [CONTACT_268708]. In the first stage, an 
individual -level regression of the individual outcome measures (e.g., QIDS -SR scores at Week 24) on the 
baseline covariates will be performed,  ignoring the clustering of the data  and then the residuals between 
observed and predicted values from this model will be used as the summary measures in the second 
stage.  
Specifically, in the first stage of the cluster -level analyses, all variables of in terest except for the study 
group (ESC or COMB -R) will be entered into the regression mode  ignoring clustering  and the summary 
statistic for each cluster will be the residual based on comparison of the summary measure calculated 
from the observed values of  the outcome measure in that cluster and the summary outcome measure 
calculated from the predicted values of the outcome measures from the model in the absence of an 
IMPAACT [ADDRESS_326977] for baseline QIDS -SR score, the site -specific residual for the 
QIDS -SR score at Week 24 will be the difference between the observed site -specific mean QIDS -SR 
score and the predicted site -specific mean QIDS -SR score (mean of the predicted QIDS -SR scores for 
that site from a linear regression model of Week 24 QIDS -SR score on baseline QIDS -SR score); the site -
specific residual for the response proportion will be the difference between the observed site -specific 
response proportion and the predicted site -specific response proportion (predicted response p roportion 
for that site from a logistic regression model). Then, in the second stage, these site -specific residuals will 
be compared using the two -sample t -test or other test as described above. Analyses of effect modification 
for cluster -level covariates and individual level covariates will be performed using methods described by 
[CONTACT_268709] (56).  
As noted above, cluster -level analyses are robust to departures from assumptions, but do not use all the 
information in the data, since the outcomes are m easured at the individual participant level. To  
supplement the cluster -level analyses  of the secondary study objectives , additional analyses will be 
conducted using individual -level regression methods, including mixed -effects linear regression models for 
continuous outcomes and generalized estimating equations (GEE) models for dichotomous outcomes. 
These individual level analyses will facilitate adjustment for baseline covariates, longitudinal analyses of 
the outcome measures over the [ADDRESS_326978] the level of high risk sex and 
alcohol/drug behaviors to decline. We will assess whether COMB -R treatment for depression is 
associated with reduced alcohol/drug and sex risk behaviors using similar met hods as described for the 
primary study objectives. Dichotomized measures for levels of high risk behaviors at weeks [ADDRESS_326979] been collected.  
7.5 Exploratory study objectives  
Similar methods to those described for the primary and secondary study objectives will be used to assess 
whether inflammatory markers decrease w ith the COMB -R intervention compared to ESC and whether 
the inflammatory markers could moderate the treatment effects on the primary outcome measures .

  1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Bausch + Lomb is finalizing the kalifilcon A Daily Disposable Toric LD213001 contact [CONTACT_788232]. For  the development of kalifilcon  A daily disposable t oric contact  [CONTACT_788233], the 
lenses have anterior and posterior optic zone surfaces that  are aspheric,  designed to provide 
a controlled  level  of negative spherical  aberration  on-eye across the entire  power range to 
reduce the natural pos itive spherical  aberration  (SA) present  in the average eye. The 
specific target for the spherical aberration control of the kalifilcon A toric lenses is to behave 
as a lens  containing  negative SA, and close  to -0.18 µm on-eye. This target aims to  reduce the 
population average spherical  aberration  value  of the eye itself  of +0.18 µm (+/- 0.05 µm ) 
over a 6mm  pupil.  
 2.[ADDRESS_1084801] lenses are providing the intended level  of spherical aberration 
correction when worn. 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 Description of Study Design 
Approximately 30 subjects per study lens power (more than [ADDRESS_1084802] that subjects won’t wear all of the study lens powers) will be enrolled in this 
single eye,  non-randomized, unmasked insertion study.  All subjects will be seen for a 
Screening/Dispensing Visit at which informed consent will be obtained and eligibility will be  
assessed. If subjects satisfy all eligibility criteria, study lenses  will be inserted .  
 
There are  a total of [ADDRESS_1084803]’s refractive error .  The number of lenses subjects are eligible for will 
determine the number of study visits the subject will complete. Each study lens will be worn for approximately 10 minutes. Subjects will complete a minimum of 1 study visit and a maximum of 2 study visits.   Visit 1: Approximately 60  minutes.  
Visit 2 : Approximately [ADDRESS_1084804]’s refractive error  will 
determine which study lenses will be worn. We are anticipating the need to enroll 
approximately [ADDRESS_1084805] (IRB)/Ethics  
Committee (EC) approval to conduct the study. 
Recruitment for this study will target soft contact [CONTACT_788234]2 -21-009: Insertion Clinical Study to Evaluate the Aberration Characteristics of kalifilcon A Toric Lenses

4.9 Risk Assessment  
Information concerning potential risks associated with the investigational device (as well as possible interactions with concomitant medical treatments and risk -to-benefit ratio) can be 
found within the Investigator’s Brochure. Risks are also summarized within the Informed Consent document. The assessments required for the study are routinely performed and are standard of care for contact [CONTACT_19554]. The subjects will be info rmed of any potential study 
specific risks in the ICF or if new risks become apparent during the study. 
 
4.9.[ADDRESS_1084813] lens wear there may be increased risk of corneal edema (swelling of the cornea) 
which may temporarily affect vision or comfort, neovascularization (small blood vessels growing into the cornea), giant papi[INVESTIGATOR_145902] (small bumps on the inside of the eyelids), iritis (internal inflammation in the eye), corneal infiltrates (corneal inflammation) and corneal erosion/abrasion or corneal infection, which if untreated may cause ocular problems.  The risks involved in this study will be minimized because the subjects will be examined frequently and at specified intervals.  The risks are further minimized by [CONTACT_145914].

Version 1.[ADDRESS_1084814] lens users.  
  4.9.2 Risk Related to Data Management  
The risks involved in this study related to data management will be minimized because the CRT will enter the data directly into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. The Primary Investigator or Delegate will visually verify the data as it is entered, except masked information when applicable.  If data is not entered directly into the EDC System, the data will be double entered.  Then, the two sets of data will be compared to each other and then checked for discrepancies.  
  Risk of data management is further minimized by [CONTACT_145916].  For example, the EDC system does not allow the same lens to be dispensed more than once. Also, the expected ranges of values are specified in the EDC system. If data falls outside of the expected range, the CRT will be prompted to answer a query.  4.10 Relevance of Clinical Investigation 
Bausch + Lomb is finalizing the kalifilcon A toric lens design . This this clinical study aims to 
confirm whether the kalifilcon A daily disposable toric contact [CONTACT_788237]. 
 5.[ADDRESS_1084815], the Investigator (or designee) will explain the purpose of the study, procedures, risks/benefits, and subject responsibilities to the potential subject. The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements of the study 
will be determined. If the subject chooses to participate in the investigation,  written informed 
consent will be obtained. The subject and the person obtaining written consent will sign and date the IRB -approved ICF. The Investigator must keep the signed ICF document. The signed 
original document should be retained in the subject’s records, and a copy should be provided to the subject. In addition, the applicable privacy regulation requirements must be met. Additional Informed Consent information is provided in Section 8.10.

  [IP_ADDRESS] Anticipated Serious Adver se Device Effect (ASADE)  
An ASADE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see definition above for Serious 
Adverse Event) or significant, non-serious criteria (see above definition for significant, non-serious AE) and which, by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome, has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application) and/or in the risk analysis report. ASADEs include: 
• Corneal Ulcer (infectious or non -infectious) 
• Keratitis  
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia)  
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discharge 
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision) 
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by [CONTACT_288830] 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
An [LOCATION_003]DE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see definition above for Serious Adverse Event) or significant, non-serious criteria (see above definition for significant, non-serious AE) and has an effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

6.3 Adverse Event Identification and Evaluation  
Throughout the course of a study all effor ts will be made to remain alert to Adverse Events 
(AEs). If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the subject and appropriate medical intervention will be made. The associated product should be retained for further analysis, if needed.  
 All AEs occurring after signing the informed consent and through the end of the subject’s 
participation in the study must be recorded and reported, if applicable. All AEs must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes.  
 
Identify potential adverse events during a clinical study by [CONTACT_145926]: 
• Direct observation by [CONTACT_737] 
• Asking the study participant using a non-specific question (i.e. Have you had any 
problems since the last visit?)  
• Unsolicited volunteering of information by [CONTACT_87755] (i.e. Doctor, I have had numerous headaches since I started using this lens)  
• Laboratory or test results that meet protocol requirements for classification as an 
adverse event (i.e. IOP over 30mmHg) 
When evaluating AEs, the Investigator should classify the AE based on the following three 
criteria: Seriousness and/or significance (based on the criteria provided in Section 6.1)   
1. Severity: • Mild: Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, requires no treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities.  
 • Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low level of 
concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities but can be relieved by 
[CONTACT_119106].  
 
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and requires 
systemic therapy or other treatment.  
 
2. The relationship of the event to the study device using the following guidelines   
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
device (contact [CONTACT_13293]) and/or solution or rewetting drops. Reasonable possibility means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or association between the study device and/or solution or rewetting drops and the AE. Also referred to as an ADE.  
• Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study device (contact [CONTACT_13293]) and/or solution or rewetting drops. This assessment implie s that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal relationship or 
association to the study device and/or solution or rewetting drops and a more likely or certain alternative etiology exists.  
 
3. Expectedness of the event

  • Unexpected Adverse Event (UAE ):  Unexpected Adverse Events must be reported 
to the IRB within 10 calendar days of discovery. 
• Expected Adverse Event:  An adverse event of which, the nature or severity of which 
is consistent with the current product labeling, investigator brochure, data sheet, etc.  
 
6.4 Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
• The Research Clinic will delegate each function’s roles and responsibilities related to adverse event reporting. The Director of Clinical Affairs is responsible for ensuring that all Research Clinic Staff understand their responsibilities for collecting and assessing adverse event information and forwarding applicable adverse event information to the appropriate business function. 
• Research Clinic Staff are responsible for understanding the procedures for adverse event collection, evaluation, documentation, and reporting.  
• Collect and record information about any identified adverse event (including the date of the adverse event, treatment, resolution, assessment of both the seriousness and the relationship to the investigational device and the related procedure) on the Adver se 
Event form. The Adverse Event Form will be completed each time the subject is seen during the management of the incident and at resolution of the incident.  
• If an adverse event is determined to be serious or significant and non-serious, notify 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_97318].  
• Report all serious or significant and non- serious adverse events within twenty -four 
(24) hours to Regulatory Affairs, Global Product Surveillance and/or Global Safety 
Surveillance and Pharmacovigilance as appropriate for the product being evaluated. Continue to send follow-up information or provide support to the appropriate reporting business function for any serious adverse event as soon as it becomes available.  
• Ensure that the subject’s identity is protected and the subject ’s identifiers in the study 
are properly documented on the form.   
• Report all unexpected adverse device effects to the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board within 10 business days of discovery.  Continue to send follow-up information 
as soon as it becomes available.  
• Report any adverse event resulting from Intentional Misuse of an investigational medical device per the same procedures as above.  
• Report any adverse event resulting from a Device Deficiency per the same procedures as above. All Device Deficiencies should be recorded and evaluated for the potential to cause a serious adverse event.   
• All appropriate measures will be taken to ensure the safety of the subject. Follow the subject until the adverse event resolves or until an appropriate endpoint is r eached. 
This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has left the study.  
• A treatment of an AE will depend on the severity of the adverse event. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_145904] a suitably licensed eye  care professional for 
immediate treatment if necessary.  
• Expenses incurred for study- related medical treatment will be paid by [CONTACT_59268] + 
Lomb. Research Clinic Staff will contact [CONTACT_788243].  
• If it is determi ned, based on evaluation of any serious adverse event or serious

  adverse event trending, that the study presents an unreasonable risk, the Research 
Clinic may choose to terminate the study. Refer to the applicable SOP: Study Termination (RCD -103) for study termination procedures for additional information 
and relevant periods for terminating a study.  
• All adverse events will be documented in the final study report. Adverse Event documentation must be saved in the Trial Master File and in the respective stud y 
folder in the electronic repository.  
 6.5 Reporting Device Deficiencies  
• Report to Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management (GPRM) and Design Quality within 24 Hours. 
• All device deficiencies must be evaluated by [CONTACT_737], and then evaluated b y 
GPRM and Design Quality. 
• The Principal Investigator (PI) will record, evaluate, and report via applicable forms any complaints/deficiencies or malfunctions experienced with the study devices using the Device Deficiency form and when applicable, AE form ( if AE has occurred). The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_788224] a serious adverse device effect (SADE). The device deficiency form is then sent to GPRM to evaluate as the Sponsor, their independent determination if the device deficiency led to or could have led to a SADE.  See ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_1084824] led to SADE.  
• If there was an Adverse Event that occurred as well as the device deficiency, then it should be reported as both an Adverse Event and a Device Deficiency (both forms should be completed). 
• If the Device Deficiency is unrelated to an Adverse Event, then just the Device 
Deficiency should be reported on the Device Deficiency form. 
• Additionally, the Device Deficiency form will be sent to Bausch + Lomb Design 
Quality to evaluate whether any updates to Design R ecords need to be made.

  APPENDIX A : METHODS OF CLINICAL EVALUATION 
Maintenance and calibration of the equipment relevant to stud y assessments must be 
appropriately performed and documented by [CONTACT_3878], where applicable. Any 
changes to the procedures described in this appendix will be provided under separate cover.  1.0 SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION  1.1 Anterior Chamber Angle Assessment  
The I ntraocular Pressure (IOP) and the Anterior Chamber angle will be evaluated prior to 
instilling dilating drops. These tests serve to rule out the risk of angle closure due to the mydriatic effect of the cycloplegic agents. If the anterior chamber angle is estimated to be ¼:1 or less using Van Herick angle estimation, dilation will not be performed.    1.2 Estimating the Depth of the Anterior Chamber Angle ( Van Herick Technique ) 
1. Align patient at the slit lamp/primary gaze  
2. Slit Lamp Set-up 
a. Position illumination arm temporally  
b. Set magn ification to medium  
c. Beam - Optic Section  
3. Focus the optic section sharply on the temporal limbus (temporal edge of cornea) 
4. Compare the width of the corneal section to the width of the shadow adjacent to it. 
5. Record observation in EDC using scale below: 
1:1 – Open angle, VH Grade 4 1:1/2 – Open angle, VH Grade 3 1:1/4 – Angle closure possible, VH Grade 2  
1: <1/4 – Angle closure likely, VH Grade [ADDRESS_1084834] Lens Centration 1.3.1 Qualitative Lens Centration 
• Compare lens edge overlap of limbus in all visible sectors.  
• If the limbus is an ill -defined band, assess from the center of the band. 
• If the contact [CONTACT_788246], assess to the average lens edge position. 
• Centration assessment applies to primary gaze.  
• If the inferior edge of the contact [CONTACT_240400], gently pull the lower eyelid away. 
 
• Rate and record lens centration on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the following lens diagrams and descriptors:  
1) Equal Overlap 360 degrees 
2) Maximum overlap ≤ 2/3 in any sector  
3) Maximum overlap > 2 /3 in any sector 
4) Any Corneal Exposure 
 1.3.2 Quantitative Lens Centration 
• Lens to limbus overlap is the distance from the limbus to the lens edge. 
• Measure the distance in millimeters (mm) in primary gaze using a slit lamp eyepi[INVESTIGATOR_788226]2 -21-009: Insertion Clinical Study to Evaluate the Aberration Characteristics of kalifilcon A Toric Lenses

  wear lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] .  
• Clinical studies have shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when 
daily wear lenses are worn overnight. 
• Studies have shown that contact [CONTACT_145938] a higher incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers.  
• If you experience eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness of the eye, you should immediately remove lenses and promptly contact [CONTACT_89635]. 
 
PRECAUTIONS  
You should be aware of and fully discuss with your eye care professional the following safety precautions: 
 
Lens Handling Precautions  
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water- base cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses than oil -base 
products. 
• Do not touch contact [CONTACT_788252],  as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing  distorted  vision and/or  
injury  to your eye. 
• Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions for lubricating or wetting your lenses. 
• Be certain that the fingers or hands are free of foreign materials before touching your lenses, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or 
injury to the eye. 
• Always handle your lenses carefully and gently and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459].  
• Always hand the same lens (right or left) to avoid mix-ups.  
• Do not touch the lens with your fingernails. 
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, storing and wearing instructions in these subject instructions and those prescribed by [CONTACT_1704]. 
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove your lenses from the lens container unless specifically indicated for that use. Pour the lens into the hand. 
 Lens Wearing Precautions 
• Never wear your lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_89635]. 
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended directions on Care for 
a Sticking (Nonmoving) Lens. The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If nonmovement of the lens continues, you should immediately consult your eye care professional.  
• Avoid, if possible, all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes when wearing lenses.

  • If aerosol products are used while wearing lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed 
until the spray has settled.  
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_145909]:  
• You should not wear contact [CONTACT_145939]. Exposure to water while 
wearing contact [CONTACT_145940], water skiing and hot tubs may increase the risk of ocular infection including but not limited to Acanthamoeba keratitis.  
• Always c ontact your eye care professional before using any medicine in the eyes.  
 
Who should know that you are wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]? 
• You may decide to inform your health care professional about being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
• Always inform your employer of being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may require the 
use of eye protection equipment or may require that you not wear lenses. 
• Ask the study investigator whether there are any other wearing restrictions that apply to you. Write those restrictions in the spaces provided below and follow them carefully: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ADVERSE REACTIONS (PROBLEMS AND WHAT TO DO)  
You should be aware that the following problems may occur: 
• Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain 
• Comfort is less than when lens was first placed on eye 
• Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area) 
• Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes 
• Unusual eye secretions 
• Redness of the eyes  
• Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity) 
• Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia)  
• Dry eyes 
 
If you notice any of the above, you should: Immediately remove your lenses.  
• If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens is in any way damaged, do not put the lens back on your eye. You should remove the lens and place it in the provided contact [CONTACT_145942]. Then insert a new lens on the eye. If the problem continues, you should immediately remove the lenses and consult your eye care 
ROC2 -21-009: Insertion Clinical Study to Evaluate the Aberration Characteristics of kalifilcon A Toric Lenses   
Version 1.[ADDRESS_1084842] lenses.   
1. Preparing the Lens for Wearing:  
It is essential that you learn and use good hygienic methods in the care and handling of your new lenses. Cleanliness is the first and most important aspect of proper contact [CONTACT_224037]. Your hands should be clean and free of any foreign substances when you handle your lenses. The procedures are:  
• Always wash your hands thoroughly with a mild soap, rinse completely, and dry with a lint-free towel before touching your lenses. 
• Avoid the use of soaps containing cold cream, lotion, or oily cosmetics before 
handling your lenses, since these substances may come into contact [CONTACT_788253].  
• Handle your lenses with your fingertips and be careful to avoid contact [CONTACT_145945]. It is helpful to keep your fingernails short and smooth. 
• Start off correctly by [CONTACT_145946].  
 
2. Handling the Lenses:  
• Develop the habit of always working with the same lens first to avoid mix-ups. 
• Position the lens on your index finger and examine it to be sure that it is moist, clean, clear, and free of any nicks or tears.  
• Should you accidentally place an inside-out lens on your eye, one of the following signs should signal you to remove and replace it correctly. 
a) Less than usual comfort, 
b) The lens may fold on the eye, 
c) Excessive lens movement on  blink, 
d) Blurred vision. 
 
• If the lens folds and sticks together: Place the lens in the palm of your hand and wet 
thoroughly with the recommended rinsing or storing solution. Then GENTLY rub the lens between your index finger and palm in a gentle back and forth motion. 
• If the lens flattens or drapes across your finger, the lens or your finger may be too wet. To correct this, dry your finger by [CONTACT_145947], drying the opposite finger each time. 
 
3. Placing the Lens on the Eye

Version 1.0                                                              CONFIDENTIAL                   July 27, 2021 
 Page 40 of 42 
  There are other methods of lens placement. If the following methods are difficult for you, 
your Study Doctor will provide you with an alternate method.  
 
NOTE: If after placement of the lens, your vision is blurred, check for the following:  The lens is not centered on the eye (see “Centering the Lens,” next in these instructions).  
If the lens is centered, remove the lens (see “Removing the Lens” section) and check for 
the following:  
• cosmetics or oils on the lens (replace the lens)  
• the lens is on the wrong eye  
• the lens is inside- out (it would also not be as comfortable as normal)  
 
If you find that your vision is still blurred after checking the above possibilities, remove both lenses and consult your eye care professional.  
 The One -Hand Placement Technique  
• Place the lens on your index finger. Head up, looking straight ahead, pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your placement hand. Look up steadily at a point above you. Then place the lens on the lower white part of your eye. Remove your index finger and slowly release the lower lid. Look down to position the lens properly. Close your eyes for a moment; the lens will center itself on your eye.  
 The Two -Hand Placement Technique  
• With the lens on your index finger, use the middle finger of the other hand to pull the upper lid against the brow. Use the middle finger of your placement hand to pull down the lower lid and then place the lens centrally on your eye. While holding this position, look downward to position the lens properly. Slowly release your eyelids.  
• If the lens feels uncomfortable, then look in the mirror and gently place a finger on the 
edge of the contact [CONTACT_788254]. Then by [CONTACT_145949], the lens will re- center itself. If the lens still feels 
uncomfortable, follow the steps described in the section of these instructions entitled “Adverse Reactions.”  
ROC2 -21-009: Insertion Clinical Study to Evaluate the Aberration Characteristics of kalifilcon A Toric Lenses   
Version 1.[ADDRESS_1084843] techniques are not performed properly. To center a lens, follow one of the procedures below.  
• Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then while looking in a 
mirror, gently place a finger on the contact [CONTACT_145950].  
OR 
• Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then, while looking in a 
mirror, move your eye towards the lens to place it on the center of the eye.  
 
5. Removing the Lens  
• Always remove the sam e lens first.  
• Wash, rinse, and dry your hands thoroughly.  
• Always be sure that the lens is in the correct position on your eye before you try to 
remove it (a simple check of your vision, closing one eye at a time, will tell you if the 
lens is in the correct position). Look up and slowly pull down your lower eyelid with the middle finger of your removal hand and place your index finger on the lower edge of lens. Squeeze the lens lightly between the thumb and the index finger and remove it. Avoid sticking the edges of the lens together. 
• Remove the other lens by [CONTACT_145951]. 
• Follow the required lens care procedures described by [CONTACT_89635].

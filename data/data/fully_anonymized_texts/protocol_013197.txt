Study design  
In this mechanistic, non -randomized controlled trial, all participants repeated testing twice in the 
following order within a single laboratory -based testing session : 1) pain -rating with activity, 2) movement 
analysis during high - and low -level tasks, 3) p ain psychology questionnaires; 4) quantitative sensory testing 
(See figure below). The only difference in procedure between groups was that the AT group received an 
anesthetic injection after the first set of tests. For participants with bilateral AT the m ore painful side was 
designated the involved side for testing and injection. A sports medicine physician used sonographic guidance 
to inject 4 mL of 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_761056]. 
This dose was  chosen based on clinical experience of the amount of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_761057] -invasive outpatient procedures. To minimize the risk of infection sterile technique was used, 
including sterile gloves, area of injection scrubbed, ster ile gel, and a sterile transducer cover. The onset for 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_333688] 10 -20 minutes and pain relief lasted for 6 -8 hours. Repeat testing began 30 minutes after the 
injection. Participants with AT were contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 1 -day and 1 -week following testing to ask ab out any injection -
related adverse events (e.g. increased pain, infection). All participants were contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 1 -week after testing to 
complete the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS).

significance defined as P≤ 0.05 (Table 1 ). Because [ADDRESS_1042304] -injection were compared with 
Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests. Mixed effects ANOVAs were used the examine the effects of group, time, and a 
group*time interaction for motor performance, pain psychology, and quantitative sensory testing. The type I 
error rate  for the ANOVAs was maintained  at 0.05 by [CONTACT_761059] (3 
tests for motor performance, 2 tests for pain psychology, 3 tests for quantitative sensory testing). Post-hoc 
comparisons were performed to examine significant interaction effects and p -values were adjusted using  a 
Bonferroni adjustment for the number of time points compared ([ADDRESS_1042305]). Pearson correlations examined relationships between the magnitude of change with an anesthetic 
injection of identified indicators of al tered central processing in the AT group.

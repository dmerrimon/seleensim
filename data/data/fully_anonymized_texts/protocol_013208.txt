Study Title:  Analgesics in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]: Implications on hemorrhage tolerance  - Ketamine  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_665196], Ph.D.

1. Introduction and Purpose:  
The purpose  of this project is to test how the three recommended analgesics currently employed in 
the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665197] —fentanyl, morphine, and ketamine —alter the capacity to 
tolerate a hemorrhagic insult in humans.  
 
Pain management on the battlefield is critical for the wellbeing of the soldier.  Given that a 
hemorrhagic injury on the battlefield is virtually always associated  with pain, it is paramount that the 
selected pain medication does not disrupt appropriate physiological mechanisms that are beneficial 
towards the maintenance of blood pressure and vital organ blood flow during that hemorrhagic insult.  
Current guidelines  for the selection of pain medications of a hemorrhaging soldier are based upon 
limited scientific evidence, with the vast majority of supporting studies being conducted on 
anesthetized animals.  Thus, the interaction between hemorrhagic shock and pain med ications 
commonly employed on the battlefield is yet to be determined in the conscious humans.   
 
With this background, we will address the following Specific Aims:  
• Specific Aim 1 : To test the hypothesis that each of the  three analgesics currently employed in 
the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665197] —fentanyl, morphine, and ketamine —will impair the 
capacity for a conscious human to tolerate a hemorrhagic insult.   
• Specific Aim 2 : To test the hypothesis that ketamine will be the least detrimental in 
compromising tolerance to a simulated hemorrhagic insult.  
 
The data obtain ed from addressing these specific aims will provide the necessary scientific evidence 
in humans to support the Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (Co TCCC) guidelines on the  
analgesic of choice for moderate to severe injuries where the casualty is in hemorrhagic shock.  
Notably, such data will identify the analgesic that least compromises a human’s ability to tolerate a 
hemorrhagic insult, ultimately pr oviding critical information to the combat medic on which analgesic 
should be employed for such an injury.   
 
2. Background:  
Hemorrhage is the leading cause of battlefield and civilian trauma deaths (1–3).  During the recent 
Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, 91% of potentially survivable casualties in US soldiers were 
hemorrhage related (4).  Hypovolemic shock associated with hemorrhage occur s in concert with a 
reduction in circulating blood volume, culminating in low tissue perfusion pressure and accompanying 
insufficient organ perfusion to meet metabolic demands.  In the early stages of a hemorrhagic injury, 
compensatory mechanisms that are vital to maintain perfusion pressure .  Depending on the severity 
of the hemorrhagic insult, these compensatory mechanisms are sufficient to maintain perfusion to vital 
organs, such as the heart and brain.  As hemorrhage continues, however, these physiologi cal 
responses are no longer able to compensate for the loss of blood volume. The individual then 
transitions into a state of non -compensable hemorrhage, manifested by [CONTACT_791217] r esulting in decreases in systemic 
vascular resistance and  cardiac output (5–8).  Arterial pressure then falls to the point where it is 
insufficient to perfuse these vital organs, culminating in death.   
 
Hemorrhagic injuries are always accompanied with pain, as long as the individual remains conscious.  
Pain mana gement of an injured soldier is a critical component of the medical care o f that casualty (9–
STU092017 -068, Crandall, Form A, Mod_5, 09 -23-19 (1)   
Version < 4.30.18 > 
Page 2 of 13 11).  Current recommendations for analgesics in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], i.e. , on the battlefield, 
include opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (morphine, fentanyl) and N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) antagon ists (ketamine) 
(10,11) .  Combat medics receive guidelines that originate from the C ommittee on Tactical Combat 
Casualty Care (CoTCCC) in choosing the ideal analgesic, based upon the type and severit y of the 
injury (10,11) .  Specifically, if the causality is experi encing moderate to severe pain AND the casualty 
is not in circulatory shock or respi[INVESTIGATOR_665198], then 
fentanyl is recommended, with morphine as an alternative if intravenous access ha s been obtained 
(10).  Conversely, if the casualty is in hemorrhagic shock or respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y distress, or s/he is expected to 
develop either of these conditions, then ke tamine is recommended (10).  However, the scientific basis 
for such recommendations are pr imarily limited to research in fully anesthetized (i.e., unconscious) 
animals.  For example, anesthetic doses (i.e., high doses that are unlikely to be employed in the pre -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]) of drugs such as ketamine reduce or remove the otherwise beneficia l 
sympathoexcitatory responses and corresponding peripheral vasoconstriction during a hemorrhagic 
insult in mammals (7,12,13) .  Moreover, morphine reduces hemorrhagic tolerance in fully 
anesthetized rats  (14), greatly  increasing mortality . To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the 
effects of analgesic doses of medications commonly employed in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665199] a simulated (or actual) hemorrhagic insult in humans.  Consistent with this concern, it is particularly 
noteworthy that “No studies have been published from the cu rrent conflict that review outcomes in 
combat causalities as a function of the type and route of analgesia used in combat casualties as well 
as the type and severity of wounds sustained, and physiological parameter indicative of circulatory or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219].” Quote from 2014 b y Butler et al. (10).  
 
We propose that i f sufficient doses of commonly employed analgesics are administered to humans, 
otherwise appropriate cardiovascular responses to the hemorrhagic insult will be suppressed, thereby 
[CONTACT_665222].  That said, the effects of analgesic doses of 
such agents (i.e., doses that are recommended for the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]) on physiological 
responses necessary to preserve tolerance to a hemorrhagic insult in humans is entirely unknown.  
Moreover, the aforementioned gu idelines by [CONTACT_665223] -specific analgesics are not 
based upon hypothesis driven scientific evidence in humans, but rather primarily from fully 
anesthetized animals.  Thus, the applicability of that research to a soldier experiencing a hemorrh agic 
injury is questionable and remains a significant gap in the knowledgebase.     
 
 
3. Concise Summary of Project:  
Three separate protocols, one for each analgesic —fentanyl, morphine, and ketamine  will be 
employed .   
 
Up to five laboratory visits will be  required for this protocol .  
 
The first visit will begin with the consenting process. Should the interested subject qualify and agree to 
participate in the study, he/she will  undergo up to four separate experimental visits (up to two placebo 
and up to two ketamine ) each conducted on different day s.  
 
Two lower -body negative pressure experimental visits: After instrumentation, subjects will rest quietly 
followed by [CONTACT_791218] (via algometer, th ermal grill, and 
the cold pressor test; order randomized).  Subjects will then receive the drug along with the 
progressive  lower -body negative pressure (LBNP) .  If necessary, a fter waiting for the effects of the 
first administration of this drug to subside , the drug will again be administered, followed by a recording 
of post -drug data and re -performance of the pain assessments .  For the placebo trial, saline (sodium 
chloride 0.9% or  if unavailable,  5% dextrose in water) will be administered where “Drug 
Administration” is indicated below . The enrolled subject will be asked to complete both placebo and 
drug challenges.

Page 3 of 13 Two resting  control experimental visits: After instrumentation, subjects will rest quietly followed by 
[CONTACT_791219]. Subjects will then receive the drug and rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] . For the 
placebo trial, saline (sodium chloride 0.9% or if unavailable, 5% dextrose in water) will be 
administered. The enrolled subject will be asked  to complete  both placebo and drug  trials . In order to 
reduce participant burden, a subset of individuals may be asked to complete the two quiet rest control 
experimental visits but not the visits that involve pain tests and LBNP.  
 
4. Study Procedures:  
All procedures in this protocol are experimental.  Therefore, none of the procedures are "standard of 
care."  
 
Experimental P rotocol :  
Each subject will undergo up to four  separate experimental visits (up to two placebo and up to two 
drug), each conducted on a different day, with the order randomized.  The selected dose  (see below)  
is not expected to cause unconsciousness or significant sedation.  For females , testing will be  
conducted during the same phase of the menstrual cycle or contraceptive use.  
 
The protocol , and approximate times,  for two of the experimental visit s is illustrated in Figure 1.  
 
Following instrumentation and a quiet resting period, baseline data will be obtained.  This will be 
followed by [CONTACT_665225] a digital algometer, thermal grill, and a 
cold pressor test.  Following  the pain assessment, the  doses of the analgesic (or placebo) will be 
administered, with these doses being consistent with the US Army’s Co TCCC guidelines (10):  
Ketamine: (placebo and 20 mg intravenous)  
 
Next,  a progressive LBNP challenge  will be completed  until the onset of syncopal symptoms (defined 
as: profound bradycardia, a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_665200], a sustained systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg, and/or subjective 
symptoms such as light -headedness, sweating, nausea, or dizziness) .  After waiting for the effects of 
the firs t administration of this drug to subside, the drug will again be administered, followed by a re -
performance of the pain assessments.   The purpose of repeated (i.e., two) drug administrations per 
trial is to ensure that the subject receives the peak concen tration of the drug at the time of the LBNP 
testing  as well as during the pain assessments .  Blood  for the assessment of hemostatic responses  
will be drawn  at the following time points to  evaluat e hemostatic function : baseline , after drug 
administration but before progressive LBNP, immediately after LBNP, and 60 min after LBNP .

Primary Outcome Variables  
The primary outcome variable will be the ability to tolerate the LBNP challenge prior to the onset of 
signs and symptoms associated with e nsuing syncope.   
 
Study Endpoints  
Data collection will end when 30 subjects  (15 men and 15 women)  have completed the experimental 
protocol  and when u p to [ADDRESS_1090702]. Crandall’s laboratory showing reduced LBNP 
tolerance in the heat -stressed individuals (15).  In that study heat stressed reduced LBNP tolerance 
by ~70% (997 cumulative stress index units to 303 cumulative stress index units; P<0.001).  Though 
we expect the analgesics to likewise reduce LBNP tolerance, we do not anticipa te as large of a 
reduction as that observed with heat stress.  Thus, the sample size calculation was based upon an 
anticipated reduction in LBNP tolerance of half that seen with heat stress, i.e., ~35% reduction in the 
cumulative stress index.  Given this anticipate outcome, coupled with the associated variances 
observ ed in that study (15), we anticipate 15 subjects per drug trial will be sufficient to address the 
primary hypothesis that the administered analgesic reduces tole rance to a simulated hemorrhagic 
insult, with a study power=0.80 at an adjusted alpha=0.015 to account for comparisons between 
drugs.  That value was inflated to 30 subjects in total (15 male and 15 female) to permit a comparison

pain tests and LBNP, a smaller subset (n=15) of individuals will allow us to make comparisons 
between the drug and placebo in a resting control state.  
 
5. Sub-Study Procedures:  
Not applicable  
 
6. Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects:  
• 18-45 years of age  
• Healthy  
• Non-obese (body mass index less than 30  kg/m2) 
• Body mass greater than or equal to 65 kg  
• Speak English  
 
7. Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:  
• Subjects not in the defined age range  
• Subjects who have cardiac , respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], neurological and/or metabolic illnesses  
• Any known history of renal or hepatic insufficiency/disease  
• Pregnancy or breast feeding  
• Body mass less than 65 kg  
• Current smokers, as well as individuals who regularly smoked within the past 3 years  
• Subjects who cannot speak or read English  
• Positive urine drug screen  
• Currently taking pain modifying medication(s)  
 
Although this study requires relatively uncomplicated procedures, inclusion of non -English speaking 
subjects would compromise subject safety. Consequently, it is imperative that the research and 
medical staff are able to communicate instantly and effectively with subjects, without the need of a 
translator. Therefore, the investigators feel that inclusion of non -English speakers would mar kedly and 
unnecessarily increase the risk to those participants.  
 
8. Sources of Research Material:  
“Research Material” (i.e., data) will be obtained from healthy human subjects. See section 4: Study 
Procedures for a list of data that will be obtained.     
 
Healthy individuals : Complete datasets will be obtained from a total of 30 individuals ( 15 men and 15 
women)  for the experimental visits . Complete datasets will be obtained from up to 15 individuals for 
the resting control experimental visits.  Subjects w ill be 18 -45 years.  
 
Due to screening failures (e.g., not determined to be healthy, use of medication, etc.), we anticipate 
60 subjects will be c onsented to achieve the desired ~45 subjects.  
 
9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  
Subjects will be recruited from the Dallas/Fort Worth area using an IRB approved existing database of 
over 2500 subjects held at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, IRB# STU [ADDRESS_1090704] our recruiting staff. The text will be used to recruit 
via ResearchMatch, CenterWatch, the Community Research Registry at UT Southwestern Medical 
Centre, Faceb ook, twitter , home owner associations, local churches, health and fitness centers /clubs ,

Version < 4.30.18 > 
Page [ADDRESS_1090705], the member of the research team will explain the study 
(purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, alternati ves to participation, etc.) in lay language. Furthermore, 
the research team member will perform an initial screening to ensure that the inclusion criteria are met 
and that the subject does not meet any of the exclusion criteria to participate in the study.  If all 
inclusion criteria are met, the interested individual will subsequently be invited to visit the laboratory, 
during which he/she  will be provided adequate time to read the consent, ask additional questions and 
consider his/her options. Care will be taken that the subject is not pressured but that staff is available 
to address any questions. If the potential subject indicates that they would like to participate, open -
ended questions will be asked to assess comprehension. If however, the potential subj ect needs 
additional time he/she can take the consent home to consider further. Staff phone numbers will be 
provided for questions. For subjects that agree to participate in the study, the potential subject will be 
asked to sign the consent form, fill out a self -reported medical history and we will measure their 
resting blood pressure , perform a resting [ADDRESS_1090706]/consent before determining eligibility. Excessive amounts 
of time and other resources could potentially be wasted inviting subjects to participate without proper 
preliminary screening that would hel p determine eligibility. With regard to information collected, all 
preliminary screening information will be shredded if it is determined that the individual does not 
qualify or if the subject is not consented. If the individual qualifies and is consented,  the preliminary 
screening information will be included in the subject’s laboratory chart.  
 
Persons from vulnerable populations will not be invited to participate. Potential subjects will not be 
coerced to participate, nor will coercive language be used in  any recruitment materials. When 
presenting the study to subjects, all risks will be outlined, and it will be explained as completely 
voluntary.  
 
Subjects will be paid $35.[ADDRESS_1090707] wages.   If needed, ground transportation to 
and from the research center (IE EM) will be provided or reimbursed.   
 
10. Potential Risks:  
The techniques utilized in the research project that pose potential risks are outlined below:  
 
Peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter  and saline infusion :  A sterile catheter will be inserted into  an arm 
vein for the purpose s of analgesic  administration  (i.e. ketamine)  and blood collection . In order to 
maintain patency of the catheter, saline will be infused through the venous catheter.   There is a small 
risk of infection and a still smaller risk of a blood clot or breakage of the catheter. The likelihood of 
these complications is remote (about 1 in 10,000) when the procedure is carried out by [CONTACT_791223], as during this study. There is also a small r isk of the 
STU092017 -068, Crandall, Form A, Mod_5, 09 -23-19 (1)

discomfort, bleeding, and/or bruising and on rare occasions, a person may feel dizzy or faint.  
 
Analgesic (Ketamine)  administration:  
Ketamine  acts prim arily as an antagonist at the NMDA receptor.  Ketamine has common side effects 
such as hypertension, tachycardia, nausea , anorexia, vomiting , increased salivation, horizontal 
nystagmus, and agitation/delirium. This drug exposes you to the risks of addiction, abuse, and 
misuse.  In very rare cases, it can cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].  However, at the doses and times 
proposed in this protocol, i t is not our expectation that significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_175236].  
We will monitor the patient's vital signs continuously.  Specifically, pulse oximetry and end tidal carbon 
dioxide will be monitored continuously; these two monitors will provide  sufficient accuracy and 
robustness to administer this medication safely.  An anesthesiologist will be present at all times to 
observe and intervene should the patient present with the slightest evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826].  Interventions will occur well before any patient danger should arise.  All standard airway 
intervention equipment will be readily available at all times.  There is no specific antagonist available.  
The best course of action to reverse these adverse effects is time for metabolism and elimination.  
 
Microneurography:  There is a slight risk of a temporary pi[INVESTIGATOR_665206]; however this feeling goes away 
within [ADDRESS_1090709]: This technique for pain assessment does not cause any damage to human

Cold pressor t est:  This widely used technique for pain assessment presents minimal risk.  For this 
test, immersion of the hand in ice cold water will elicit painful sensations as well as  an increase in 
blood pressure.  These typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] r esponses are immediately lessened to pretest levels  with the removal 
of the subject’s hand from the ice water.  The maximum duration for this test is three minutes and the 
subject can voluntarily remove the hand from the ice water at any time.   
 
Pressure a lgometry : This pain assessment technique is conducted by [CONTACT_175242] a 
hand -held digital algometer on the subject’s digit.  Force will be gradually increased and the peak 
force is recorded when the subject first reports a painful sensation.  Removal of the pressure from the 
algometer immediately r elieves the painful sensation and the subject can voluntarily stop the test at 
any time.   
 
Measurement of internal temperature : Intestinal temperature will be measured with a temperature -

be inserted to a pre -marked depth of [ADDRESS_1090712] had any heart 
conditions,  inflammatory bowel or colon disease, and/or rectal or anal surgery. They also may not use 
the probe if they currently have hemorrhoids (internal or external), rectal bleeding, diarrhea or fecal 
impaction in the rectum. Each subject’s medical history will be verified prior to self -insertion of the 
rectal probe by [CONTACT_54340].  
 
Electrocardiogram :  In some cases, individuals have developed a rash or redness where the patches 
were attached. This rash is mild and typi[INVESTIGATOR_665213].  
 
Lower body negative p ressure : The possible risks of this procedure are light -headedness, feeling 
faint, nausea and rarely a subject may faint. If this occurs, the procedure will stopped and the subject 
will begin to feel better almost immediately.  
 
Loss of c onfidentiality :  Anytime information is collected there is a potential risk for loss of 
confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep information confidential, however, this cannot be 
guaranteed.  
 
All other procedures  (blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, skin temperature, forearm blood 
flow, cerebral blood flow, skin  blood flow, compensatory reserve index , end tidal carbon dioxide,

Overall, it is our opi[INVESTIGATOR_791213]. 
The researchers are experienced with all procedures outlined in this study.  A critical care trained RN 
will monitor the well -being of each subject and will be available as needed.  Moreover, Joseph 
Hendrix, MD (a board ce rtified anesthesiologist) will oversee the administration of  the analgesics and 
will continuously monitor the subjects throughout the protocol.  [CONTACT_665251] has specialized training in 
Pain Medicine, which includes the administration of the assessed drugs i n his clinical practice; thus, 
he is well versed in the administration of these drugs and any potential adverse effects.  In addition, 
Benjamin D. Levine, MD, Medical Director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, or 
cardiology fellows currently working at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine , will be 
available to assist as needed.  
 
11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:  
The researchers are experienced with all procedures outlined in this study. All subjects must be 
healthy to participate. The risks and benefits will be explained to the subjects before each signs an 
institutionally -approved consent form.  
 
Craig Crandall, Ph.D will oversee subject safety and data integrity throughout the study. [CONTACT_40344] 
has conducted studies such as these for ~20 years and is qualified to perform these responsibilities. 
Data monitoring will include study accrual rate, pa rticipant experience, study 
attrition/withdrawals/dropouts, patterns of adverse and/or unanticipated events, patterns of protocol 
violations and/or deviations and changes in risk/benefit. The data will be reviewed at least on a 
quarterly basis. A progress report summarizing the data will be submitted to the IRB at the time of 
continuing review and more frequently as indicated.

Page [ADDRESS_1090713] .  As stated above,  Joseph Hendrix, MD (a 
board certified anesthesiologist) will  oversee the  administration of  the analgesics and will continuously 
monitor the subjects throughout the protocol.  Dr . Hendrix has specialized training in Pain Medicine, 
which includes the administration of the assessed drugs in his clinical practice; thus, he is well versed 
in the administration of these drugs and any potential adverse effects.  The protocol dictates that 
subjects remain awake/conscious throughout the procedures. The absenc e of significant sedation or 
altered of mental status will be ensured by [CONTACT_665244].  
The subjects will have their vital signs monitored continuously with standard patient monitors.  
Resuscitative equipment will be  readily available, including but not limited to supplemental oxygen, 
suction capacity, cardiac arrest cart with intravenous fluid and drugs (including naloxone), airway and 
intubation devices.  [CONTACT_175247] will intervene to ensure patient safety with any or all of these 
resources should the subject have any derangements outside of acceptable normal parameters for 
their vital signs.  Upon the conclusion of the protocol, subjects will not be permitted to leave the 
laboratory until all of the following discha rge variables are met:  
• The subject presents with an Aldrete score (post -anesthesia discharge scoring system) 
matching baseline,  
• The subject demonstrates a awareness of time, person, and place and is able to answer 
questions appropriately  
• The subject is a ble to stand up and walk for  5 minutes without assistance (supervised)  
• The subject is able to drink water and eat crackers without reports of nausea  
• The subject able to void    
To be consistent with THR/UTSW hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799] —the subject will be required to have a 
responsible adult bring them home.  The responsible adult can either drive the subject home or 
accompany the subject home using ground transportation (bus, train, or taxi service).  The subject will 
also receive the recommendation to have someone  observe  them for the rest of the day and 
overnight.  
 
The doses of the drugs are expected to cause analgesia, but with the subject remaining conscious 
and responsive to verbal commands.  These drugs are routinely administered for pain control in the 
absenc e of significant sedation.  Nevertheless, if after the first or second administration of the 
selected analgesi c the subject is not responding appropriately to verbal commands (e.g., is 
excessively sleepy/sedated) or experiences any related adverse response s to the administered drug, 
the trial will be cancelled for that subject.   
 
Subjects who, during the study, manifest a new onset, previously hidden or unknown cardiovascular, 
neurological or metabolic disease/illness will be removed from the study.  
  
The study will be stopped immediately for safety if a serious, unexpected problem or adverse event 
occurs. The entire project will be terminated if this event is determined to place future participants at 
undue risk.  
 
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  
1) Information will be given to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_665215].  
2) Information concerning subject’s medical histories will be furnished by [CONTACT_665245].  
3) This information will be used to determine qualification for p articipation in the investigation.  
4) Personal information will remain in the subject’s study chart and will not be released in any form to 
others unless permitted by [CONTACT_423].  
5) The consenting process for each subject will be conducted in a private room.

Page 12 of 13 6) No subject will be identified by [CONTACT_665246]. All computer 
records will be coded and will not include the subject’s name. All coded computer records will be 
saved on password protected computer systems and data files are  maintained on a secure server.  
7) The signed consent form will be kept on file in the subject’s laboratory chart. Paper records of 
experiments and copi[INVESTIGATOR_791214]’s office which is locked whenever the nurse is not present.  
8) The urine specimens collected for the drug screening will not be labeled and will be directly 
handed to a member of the study team by [CONTACT_2299] (making it anonymous). There is no 
processing required as the re sults appear on the side of the specimen collection cup.  
 
Screening is conducted by [CONTACT_665247] -to-face interview in a private area. Study visits 
(including consenting) take place in the lab and are restricted to authorized personnel only.  
 
As part of [LOCATION_007] Health Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_665217], we utilize two identifiers (name [CONTACT_665250]) to process subject samples through the IEEM biochemistry lab.  
 
All data collected will be de -identified and only research personnel will have acces s. All digital 
recordings will be locked and password protected. Paper records will be handled as stated above.  
After three years, if the information is no longer needed, it will be shredded or otherwise appropriately 
destroyed so as to be unreadable. How ever, any time information is collected; there is a potential risk 
for loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep information confidential; however, this 
cannot be guaranteed.  
 
13. Potential Benefits:  
We do not anticipate that individuals p articipating in the research will receive any direct benefit.   
 
As a result of the proposed studies , upon the completion of this objective, the Department of Defense 
will be provided with critical information regarding improved care of the hemorrhaging victim in a pre -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Combat injuries associated with hemorrhage are almost always accompanied with 
severe acute pain. This project focuses on evaluating analgesics employed by [CONTACT_791226]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], with an obj ective of identifying the/those analgesic(s) that do not, or only 
minimally, impair tolerance to a simulated hemorrhagic challenge in humans. Since hemorrhage is 
often encountered on the battlefield, it is imperative that the administered analgesic does no t impede 
physiological responses that protect against ensuing hypovolemic shock. That is, the optimal 
analgesic used for battlefield trauma should provide pain control without impeding appropriate 
physiological responses to hemorrhage. The proposed experim ents will serve to identify the effects of 
three currently recommended analgesics in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] (morphine, fentanyl, and 
ketamine) on tolerance to a simulated hemorrhage in conscious humans.  The proposed work will also 
explore possible sex d ifferences that may affect one’s ability to compensate for a hemorrhagic 
challenge while receiving each of these three analgesics.  
 
With regard to those outside the military, the experiments outlined in this application will determine the 
effect of current ly employed pain medications on tolerance to a simulated hemorrhage in humans. 
These data will identify the pain medication that least compromises a human’s ability to tolerate such 
an insult, thereby [CONTACT_665249] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_791215].  Obtaining these data will be the first step in the continuum of 
research that will culminate in an increased understanding of the link between analgesia and 
hemorrhage. Moreover, the propo sed work is particularly unique in that it will be the first investigation 
conducted in conscious humans to identify the optimal pain medication that will only minimally impair 
compensatory responses to a hemorrhagic injury, and thus the ability to “surviv e” that insult.  This 
information will be valuable to both the military and civilian populations as it will improve pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_791216].

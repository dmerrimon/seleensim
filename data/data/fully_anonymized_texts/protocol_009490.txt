Real-world
Evaluation
of
JBA
GlucoT rojan
with
Reducose
®
on
Glycemic
Response
Summary
The
project
is
focused
on
evaluating
the
real-world
efficacy
of
JBA
GlucoT rojan,
a
powdered
supplement
sachet
containing
Reducose,
a
natural
water
extract
of
White
Mulberry
Leaf,
which
has
been
scientifically
proven
to
reduce
the
absorption
of
sugars
and
carbs
by
[CONTACT_815794]
40%.
The
study
aims
to
compare
the
effect
of
consuming
GlucoT rojan
with
a
meal
(Test
Meal)
vs.
having
the
meal
alone
(control)
on
the
blood
sugar
response
of
50
healthy
adults,
pre-diabetes,
or
non-insulin
dependent
diabetes,
over
a
period
of
14
days.
It
is
expected
that
GlucoT rojan
will
reduce
the
incremental
area
under
the
curve
and
the
peak
for
plasma
glucose
concentration
over
120
minutes
in
normoglycemic
adults
when
compared
to
the
response
to
a
control
meal.

Please
note
that
although

Background
AQP
Pharmaceuticals,
Inc.
(“Company”)
developed
a
powdered
supplement
sachet
that
can
be
added
to
meals
targeting
consumers
who
follow
carbohydrate-heavy
Asian
diets.
The
product
is
formulated
with
the

patented
ingredient,
“Reducose
®
”,
a
natural
water
extract
of
novel
White
Mulberry
Leaf
that
has
been
scientifically
proven
to
reduce
the
absorption
of
sugars
and
other
carbs
by
[CONTACT_815794]
40%.
The
effects
have
been
confirmed
previously
via
Randomized,
Double-Blind,
Controlled
Trials
(see
Appendix
I
and
II).
The
Company
is
looking
to
conduct
a
real-world
study
of
blood
glucose
responses
to
JBA
GlucoTrojan
(see
specifications
here
)
with
a
5%
concentration
of
Reducose
®
.
The
study
will
observe
the
real-world
efficacy
of
GlucoTrojan
when
taken
with
high
carbohydrate
meals.
The
Company
wishes
to
use
the
collected
data
to
showcase
the
comparative
glycemic
impact
as
well
as
testimonials
from
participants
to
build
trust
and
loyalty
with
their
customers.
Rationale
Reducing
the
health
impact
of
dietary
sugar
intake
is
a
public
health
priority.
Mulberry
leaf
extract
may
reduce
blood
glucose
responses
following
sugar
intake
by
[CONTACT_815796]-glucosidase
inhibition
activity
of
iminosugar
constituents
such
as
1-deoxynojirimycin
(DNJ).
Mulberry
leaf
extracts
are
widely
consumed
in
Asia
for
normalizing
post-prandial
blood
glucose.
Reducose
has
been
tested
in
multiple
clinical
trials
and
lowers
the
postprandial
glucose
response
by
[CONTACT_815794]
40%
(see
Appendix).
Hypothesis
An
appropriate
dose
of
GlucoTrojan
when
co-administered
with
a
complete
meal
will
reduce
the
incremental
area
under
the
curve
and
the
peak
for
plasma
glucose
concentration
over
[ADDRESS_1129731]
of
consuming
GlucoTrojan
(mulberry-extract
formula)
with
a
meal
(Test
Meal)
vs.
having
the
meal
alone
(control)
on
the
blood
sugar
response
of
50
healthy
(non-diabetes)
adults,
pre-diabetes
or
non-insulin
dependent
diabetes
(Tester).
Experiments
will
span
[ADDRESS_1129732]
qualitative
data.
During
the
study
period,
each
tester
will
be
wearing
a
continuous
glucose
monitor
(CGM)
from
Abbott
Freestyle
Libre
(
Link
)
to
actively
track
their
postprandial
glucose
responses
for
each
meal.
The
Freestyle
Libre
measures
interstitial
glucose
levels
throughout
the
day
and
gives
back
data
in
15-minute
intervals,
transmitting
the
results
via
an
NFC
receiver
in
a
smartphone.
Sensor
memory
limitations
require
the
device
to
be
scanned
every
8
hours.
Of
note,
CGM
devices
measure
interstitial
glucose
levels
(glucose
from
the
fluid
in
between
cells)
While
interstitial
glucose
and
blood/plasma
glucose
levels
correlate
highly,
they
do
not
precisely
show
the
exact
same
reading
and
incur
a
lag
of
about
2-7
minutes
(as
reported
by
[CONTACT_815797]
)
.
Medical
diagnoses
are
not
made
from
interstitial
measurements.
Participants
enrollment
A
total
of
50
individuals
will
be
recruited
via
the
Tastermonial
database
and
ambassador
network.
A
study-specific
online
pre-screener
(see
appendix
III)
will
be
used
to
preliminarily
identify
potential
subjects
for
the
study.
Information
and

will
be
made
available
electronically
and
via
our
Trial

Participants
can
ask
questions
to
our
staff
via
email,
telephone
calls,
and
video
meetings.
The
Tastermonial
platform
will
be
used
to
manage
the
HIPAA-compliant
data
collection
process.
Written
informed
consent
for
inclusion
will
be
obtained

Data
Handling
&
Analysis
Data
Collection
The
entire
14-day
historical
blood
glucose
data
from
the
participants
will
be
made
available
for
analysis.
The
2-hour
postprandial
blood
sugar
readings
within
a
15-minute
interval
will
be
analyzed,
as
well
as
the
time-in-range
of
participants.
Additional
demographic
profiles
of
participants
will
be
collected
and
analyzed,
including
clinical
parameters
(age,
sex,
body
weight,
height,
body
mass
index,
meal
composition;
i.e.,calories,
carbohydrates,
fats,
proteins,
and
fiber)
and
individual
resting
glucose
range
(Baseline
Glucose
Range)
to
determine
their
glycemic
cohort.
The
investigators
will
also
collect
qualitative
data.
Participants
will
be
asked
to
report
their
feelings
such
as
mood
and
well-being
during
and
after
the
experiments
in
an
online
questionnaire.
The
questionnaire
will
be
finalized
with
the
approval
of
the
company.
Data
management

All
documents
relevant
to
the
study,
including
completed
ICFs,
are
hosted
on
a
secure
online
portal.
The
ICFs
are
completed
using
a
secured
data
transfer
system
on
the
HIPAA-compliant
online
portal.
The
company
has
access
to
the
de-identified
data
set.
The
data
is
saved
to
a
secured
internal
network.
All
data
is
anonymized
during
the
analysis.
HIPAA
relevant
PHI
data
privacy
of
participants
is
ensured
on
a
secured
online
portal
that
uses
the
HIPAA
compliant
AWS
servers.
All
participants
are
de-identified
and
labeled
using
a
coding
system.
Test
Validation
Methods
To
ensure
that
the
test
was
conducted
under
ideal
conditions,
e.g.
on
an
empty
stomach,
the
investigators
rely
on
the
participant’s
computed
“baseline”
or
resting
glucose
average
value,
calculated
as
the
average
of
all
their
glucose
values
from
[ADDRESS_1129741]
was
started
far
above
the
individual’s
baseline
range
,
the
test
is
considered
an
outlier
and
excluded
from
our
initial
analysis.
This
methodology
was
reviewed
by
a
registered
dietitian
and
a
statistician.
The
Baseline
range
The
baseline
range
of
each
individual
is
computed
between
[ADDRESS_1129742]:
❖
Maximum
baseline
range
should
not
exceed
102
mg/dl
for
average
non-diabetic
testers
❖
Mean
post-meal
glucose
peaks
ranging
from
99.2
±
10.5
to
137.2
±
21.1
mg/dl
❖
Time
to
post-meal
glucose
peak
is
around
46
minutes
–
1
hour
❖
Fasting
glucose
levels
between
80-86
mg/dl
These
are
not
standardized
criteria
or
ranges
but
can
serve
as
a
simple
guide
for
what
has
been
observed
as
normal
in
individuals
without
diabetes.
iAUC
Calculation
Each
participant's
eating
period
(called
a
“meal”)
is
normalized
and
overlaid
in
a
data
frame
that
captures
glucose
values
over
the
course
of
the
test.
Several
other
metrics
are
computed,
such
as
maximum
and
minimum
values,
standard
deviation,
and
others.
In
particular,
the
investigators
compute
the
iAUC
(“incremental
area
under
the
curve”),
a
measure
of
the
total
amount
of
postprandial
blood
glucose
level
increased
over
the
entire
2-hour
period
after
eating.
The
methodology
of
iAUC
calculation
follows
the
gold
standard
used
in
the
measurement
of
the
glycemic
index.
The
iAUC
metric
allows
our
team
to
easily
compare
and
rank
testing
results,
as
well
as
compare
against
the
pure
sugar
responses
or
the
sugar
tolerance
test
of
an
individual.
Data
from
each
user
is

Limitations
of
the
study
and
disclaimer
The
investigators
suggest
the
Company
to
not
draw
any
final
conclusion
from
the
statistical
analysis
illustrated
above,
given
the
nature
of
this
real-world
observational
study.
A
notable
advantage
of
using
this
system
is
that
volunteers
are
tested
in
real-world
conditions.
However,
the
test
subjects
were
not
under
strict
research
testing
conditions
which
could
have
caused
a
variance
in
the
data
generated.
Further
studies
are
required
to
further
confirm
our
findings.
As
opposed
to
the
randomized
control
trial
studies,
the
collected
data
should
provide
a
basis
to
further
observe
the
different
use
cases,
contexts
and
the
customer
profiles
that
the
Company
can
market
to.
Categorization
of
Study
Risk
and
Dietary
Supplement
Safety
The
study
falls
under
the
"Minimal
Risk"
category,
as
the
dietary
supplement
ingredients
selected
for
the
study
have
been
well-tolerated
in
previous
clinical
studies
and
consumer
products.
These
ingredients
have
either
been
on
the
market
or
submitted
as
new
dietary
ingredients
to
the
FDA.
The
manufacturing
process

used
to
obtain
the
extracts
from
the
appropriate
plant
sources
did
not
cause
any
chemical
alterations.
Moreover,
the
selected
dietary
supplements
have
a
high
safety
profile,
and
the
daily
doses
are
within
the
upper
limits
tolerated
by
[CONTACT_230070]
(where
applicable).
The
ingredients
are
also
on
the
GRAS
list,
and
although
there
is
a
possibility
that
some
participants
may
have
a
sensitivity
to
the
herbal
ingredients,
there
are
no
known
side
effects
associated
with
the
test
product.
The
potential
benefits
of
the
dietary
supplements
outweigh
the
negligible
risks,
except
for
the
potential
risk
of
gastrointestinal
upset
for
participants
with
previously
unrecognized
allergies
or
sensitivities
to
any
ingredient.
Regarding
confidentiality,
the
risk
is
minimal
as
all
study
participant
information
will
be
de-identified,
and
since
it
is
a
virtual
study,
no
confidential
or
protected
information
will
be
taken
outside
the
standard.
In
the
unlikely
event
that
complications
arise,
and
additional
medical
care
is
required,
there
is
a
slight
financial
risk
to
the
participants.
Assessment
of
Benefits
This
study
aims
to
evaluate
the
benefits
of
using
the
test
product,
including
enhancements
in
participants'
quality
of
life
and
improvements
in
their
blood
glucose
levels.
Conflict
of
interests
Ensuring
the
impartiality
of
this
study,
free
from
any
actual
or
perceived
external
influence,
is
of
utmost
importance.
To
that
end,
any
individual
involved
in
the
trial's
design,
implementation,
analysis,
publication,
or
any
other
aspect
must
disclose
and
appropriately
manage
any
actual
or
perceived
conflict
of
interest.
In
cases
where
a
perceived
conflict
of
interest
exists,
the
individual
must
take
measures
to
ensure
their
involvement
in

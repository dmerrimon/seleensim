Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1008430] Version of the Approved Protocol
Sections Affected by [CONTACT_738065] 2.0STUDY SUMMARY
Section 6.3.1 Duration of an 
Individual Patient’s Study 
Participation
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Efficacy 
Endpoint Analyses
Section 13.2 IAA futility analysis will be performed 
with the interim analysis. Due to strategic considerations, a 
futility  analy sis is added to the 
interim analysis so that the study 
could be terminated early if the real 
efficacy of alectinib and brigatinib in 
the stud y populatio n significantly 
deviates from the study assumption.
Section 8.3Recommended Dosing 
and Dose Modification GuidelinesUpdated the creatine phosphokinase
(CPK )dose modification guidance .Alignedprotocol with the current 
CCDS V3 dose modification 
guidance for CPK elevation. 
An analy siswas performed using 
data from Studies 301 and 201 to 
evaluate the relationship of CPK 
increase, brigatinib treatment 
duration and muscular toxicities. The 
results suggested that CPK increase 
was associated with longer duration

Study No. Brigatinib -[ADDRESS_1008431] Version of the Approved Protocol
Sections Affected by [CONTACT_738066]. Also, review of 
individual patient data from Studies 
301 and 201 showed only 1 report of 
patient with a Grade 3 CPK elevation 
as well as a Grade 3 muscular 
toxicity (P referred Term: muscular 
toxic ity). 
Additionally, many of the 49 patients 
from pooled Studies 301 and 201 
with a Grade ≥3 CPK elevation did 
not report a muscular toxicity event 
(any grade or Grade ≥3). 
Based on these analyses, it was 
concluded that the dose modification 
for CPK elevations of Grade 3 and 4, 
without concurrent muscular 
toxicity, is not warranted and 
therefore the guidance was modified 
accordingly. 
Section 8.6Precautions and 
RestrictionsAdded precautions for 
photosensitivity to sunlight.Mitigation of photosensitivity to 
sunlight, which has been observed in 
patients treated with brigatinib .
Section 8.10 Storage, Handling, and 
AccountabilityUpdated the storage condition of 
brigatinib to “Store at controlled 
room temperature of20°C to 25°C 
with excursions permitted be tween 
15°C to30°C. ”Update of the storage condition of 
brigatinib to be consistent with 
Investigational Medicinal Product 
Dossier and other documents.
Section 8.[ADDRESS_1008432] 
delivery of the drugs from the study 
site to the patient ’s home to make 
sure the patients are able to continue 
the treatment without physically 
going to the study center.

Appendix ASchedule of EventsProvide dclarification that the 
collection of tumor assessment data 
is not required if the patient has 
progressed and has started treatment

beyond progression.
Section 11.[ADDRESS_1008434] of 
the countri es participating the study ,
and some of the study centers were 
temporarily  closed or limiting 
entrance of nonpatient personnel. 
This made the on -site SDV 
impossible in some of the sites. To
ensure data integrity, remote source 
data verification was allowed and 
conducted in a small number of sites.

2018 -001957 -29
Study Number: Brigatinib -3001 Phase: 3
Study Design: 
A phase 3, randomized, open -label, comparative, multicenter, international study of patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase -positive (ALK+) non –small - cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on crizotinib
Primary Objective:
To compare the efficacy of brigatinib to that of alectinib in patients with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
who have progressed on crizotinib as evidenced by [CONTACT_3988] -free survival (PFS) as assessed by [CONTACT_738067] n Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.
Secondary Objectives:
1.To compare the efficacy of brigatinib to that of alectinib as evidenced by [CONTACT_70085] (OS), PFS as assessed
by [CONTACT_093], objective response rate (ORR), time to response, and duration of response (DOR) (all as
assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1).
2.To compare the efficacy of brigatinib in the central nervous syste m (CNS)to that of alectinib as evidenced by
[CONTACT_738068] (iORR), intracranial duration of response (iDOR), and time to intracranial
progressive disease (iPD) without prior systemic progression as assessed by [CONTACT_47326] .
3.To assess the safety and tolerability of brigatinib in comparison with alectinib.
4.To collect plasma concentration -time data for brigatinib to contribute to population pharmacokinetic (PK)
analy ses.
5.To assess patient -reported symptoms and health- related quality of life (HRQoL) with the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire -Core 30 (QLQ -C30) (v3.0) and its
Quality  of Life Lung Cancer Module (QLQ -LC13), in patients treated with brigatinib compared w ith those treated
with alectinib.
Exploratory Objectives: 
1.To compare the efficacy in the CNS of brigatinib to that of alectinib as evidenced by [CONTACT_738069], iDOR, and time to
iPD, per the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO -BM) criteria.
2. T o explore the molecular determinants of efficacy and safety with brigatinib and alectinib.
3.To evaluate health resource utilization.
4.To use patient reported outcomes to assess morbidity related to CNS symptoms.

CONFIDENTIALSafety Endpoints:
Safety assessments will include physical and laboratory examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Adverse 
events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.
Exploratory Endpoints:
1.CNS efficacy outcomes as assessed by [CONTACT_738074] -BM crit eria (iORR, iDOR, and time to iPD).
2.Molecular determinants of efficacy and safety with brigatinib and alectinib.
3.HRQoL measured by [CONTACT_399128] –5 Dimensions –5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) questionnaires.
4.Items from the EORTC Quality of Life Brain Cancer Module (QLQ -BN20) used to assess morbidity related to 
CNS symptoms.
5.To evaluate health resource utilization.
Statistical Considerations:
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using a [ADDRESS_1008448] (stratification 
factors: presence of intracranial CNS metastases at baseline [yes vs no] and best prior response to crizotinib therapy as 
assessed by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator [complete response/partial response vs any other response/status unknown]) to compare 
BIRC -assessed PFS of patients randomized to brigatinib with the BIRC -assessed PFS of patients randomized to 
alectinib. The overall (2 -sided) type I error r ate will be controlled at 0.05. The primary analysis will be based on the 
intent -to-treat population. The Kaplan Meier (K -M) survival curves and K -M estimates (if estimable), along with their 
2-sided 95% CIs, will be provided for each treatment group. Addi tionally, hazard ratios will be estimated using the 
stratified Cox regression model with the stratification factors.
The interim analysis (IA) for efficacy and futility will be performed after the first [ADDRESS_1008449] been observed. An 
O’Brien -
Fleming Lan -DeMets alpha spending function will be used to control the overall alpha level at 0.05 2 -sided. 
A gamma spending function will be used for the futility s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106]. Futility is nonbinding. OS, the key 
secondary endpoint, will be formally tested for statistical significance only once when PFS per BIRC is statistically 
significant. 
Further details of statistical analyses including the data handling ru les will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.
Sample Size Justification: 
For the purposes of this sample size calculation, the median PFS for alectinib is estimated as 9 months and the PFS for 
brigatinib is estimated to be 15 months on the basis of the outcomes observed in previous single -arm studies. 
Approximately 246 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive brigatinib or alectinib. A total of 164 events 
(progression or death among the randomized patients) will provide 90% power t o detect a 6 -month improvement in 
PFS (hazard ratio=0.60). This power projection is based on a 2-sided log -rank test, and is controlled at the 2 - sided 0.05 
level, adjusting for the proposed IAplan. The number of events is fixed, but the enrollment number may change based 
on an assessment of the overall event rate pooled across treatment groups before the close of enrollment.

12.9% of all new cancers worldwide [
1]. Globally, lung cancer accounted for 1.6 millio n cases and 
1.4 millio n deaths in 2008 [
2]. It is the leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and 
in the Euro pean Unio n (EU). In the US, an estimated 234,030 new cases of lung cancer will be 
diagnosed by [CONTACT_5014] o f 2018, and 154,050 deaths are estimated to occur due to the disease [3]. In 
the EU, lung cancer is ranked as the fourth most frequent cancer; approximately 313,000 new 
cases were diagnosed in 2012 with 268,000 deaths in that year [
1]. Five -year survival rates remain 
low: 17.7% and 13% in the US and Europe, respectively  
[4,5]. In Japan, lung cancer is ranked as 
the third most frequent cancer; approximately 113,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 and 
approximately  71,500 deaths in that y ear (ganj oho.jp/reg_stat/statistics/index.html, Accessed 
07March 2018 [in Japanese]). Most  lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages and about 
78% of newly diagnosed patients have regional/distant disease [1,6] .
Historically, l ung cancers have been stratified on the basis o f histol ogic criteria and are generally 
divided into 2 categories: small -cell lung cancer and no n
–small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
NSCLC is the most prevalent histologic class, accounting for more than 80% of all lung cancers 
[
7,8], and includes a number of subt ypes such as adenocarcino ma, squamous cell carcino ma, large 
cell carcino ma, and bronchio loalveo lar carcino ma [
9]. More recently, attention has turned to 
stratifying pat ients with lung cancer on the basis o f molecular alterations since it has beco me clear 
that histol ogically  identical tumors are driven by [CONTACT_738075] y to 
respond different ly to therapeutic intervent ion, such as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648623] ( EGFR ) mutant, ALK receptor ty
rosine kinase ( ALK) rearranged, ROS 
proto -oncogene 1, receptor ty rosine kinase ( ROS1 ) rearranged, or B- Raf p roto-oncogene, 
serine/threonine kinase ( BRAF ) V600E mutant NSCLC. The focus herein is on NSCLC that 
contain oncogenic rearrangements in the ALK gene, and the role of brigat inib, a novel small 
molecule inhibitor, in the treatment of anaplast ic lympho ma kinase -positive(ALK+) NSCLC. 
4.1.2 ALK+ NSCLC
Anaplast ic lympho ma kinase (ALK) is a ty rosine kinase encoded on chromoso me 2 and is 
primarily invo lved in developmental processes and expressed at low levels in adults [10]. The first 
genet ic rearrangement of ALK seen in NSCLC involved a fusio n between the echinoderm 
microtubule associated protein like 4 gene ( EML4) and the ALK tyrosine kinase dom ain. 
EML4 -ALK has the capacit y to transform fibroblasts grown in culture and as subcutaneous 
xenografts to induce tumor format ion [
11]. Since then, a number of addit ional ALK fusio n 
partners have been described in NSCLC that are be lieved to result in aberrant signaling and 
oncogenic transformat ion [12,13] .

CONFIDENTIALEstimates of the frequency o f ALKrearrangement in the overall populat ion of pat ients with 
NSCLC range from 2% to 7% [14,15] , which represent, based on proportionalit y of total  
popul ations in the US and EU, approximately 7000 to 25,000 patients in the US and 5800 to 
20,000 patients in the EU with ALK+ NSCLC in 2016. ALK rearrangements are more common 
among pat ients with adenocarcino ma histol ogy, pati ents who have never smoked, and patients 
who have wild -type EGFR and KRAS proto
-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS ) [10]. 
4.1.3 Current Treatment for ALK+ NSCLC
While the standard treatment algorithm for patients with unselected NSCLC has historically 
involved front line treatment with chemotherapy, recent clinical trials have demo nstrated that
patients wi th ALK+ l ocally  advanced or m etastati c NSCLC respond well to treatment with the 
ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib, and cerit inib). Crizotinib received accelerated approval fro m 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 on the basis of resul ts from 2single -arm 
studi es [
16]. The efficacy of crizotinib has been confirmed in a randomized study  of crizotinib 
versus chemotherapy  [
16,17] .
ALK -dependent mechanisms o f resistance, observed in approximately 30% of pat ients [
18], 
include the acquisit ion of secondary mutations in ALK that interfere with crizotinib binding, 
and/or amplification of the ALK fusio n gene. More than [ADDRESS_1008457] commo n being L1196M and 
G1269A [
19,20] . The central nervous system (CNS) is the first site of progression in 
approximately  50% of  patients treated with crizotinib [21,22] , suggesting inadequate penetration 
of crizotinib into the brain (ie, pharmaco logic failure) as the primary  cause of  resistance in these 
patients. Therefore, an ALK inhibitor that can overcome secondary  resistance m utations in ALK, 
has adequate penetration into the CNS, and is less suscept ible to pharmaco logic failure, m ay be 
requi red to ove rcome resistance.
Recent ly, 2 other ALK inhibitors, cerit inib [23]and al ectinib [24], have beco me available for 
patients wi th NSCLC wit h ALK rearrangements. Both drugs are effect ive in pat ients previously 
treated with crizotinib. Cerit inib demo nstrated significant ly improved progressi on-free survival 
(PFS) vs chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55) [25]whereas alect inib demo nstrated significant ly 
improved PFS vs crizotinib (HR 0.34 -0.47) [
26,27] in treatment naïve ALK+ advanced NSCLC. 
ALK secondary  mutations a ssoci ated wi th clinical  resistance to ceri tinib and alect inib have also 
been ident ified, including L1152R and F1174C/V for ceritinib, I1171N/T/S for alect inib, and 
G1202R for both agents [
17,26-29] . 
More recently, the invest igational agent lorlat inib has been evaluated in a phase 1/2 study showing
responses after ≥1 prior ALK t yrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (25% [11 of 44] object ive response 
rate [ORR] in pat ients with 2 pri
or ALK T KI and 31% [4 of 13] ORR in pat ients with 3 prior ALK 
TKI). The most common treatment -related adverse events (AEs) wer e hypercho lesterol emia (90%) 
and hypertriglyceridemia (72%) [28].

CONFIDENTIAL4.1.4 Unmet Medical Need
Significant progress has been made with incorporation of ALK TKIs for treatment of ALK+ 
NSCLC, but eventually almo st all pat ients progress after crizotinib wit h over 50% of these patients 
developin g brain metastases. The impact of progressio n is seen in the qualit y of life o f patients as 
well as their survival. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 2 ALK inhibitors (ie, cerit inib and alect inib) being available for 
crizotinib failures, the majorit y of patients currently treated w ith ALK inhibitors in second- line 
therapy  progress wi thin [ADDRESS_1008458] been i dentified. The alternat ive 
treatm ents for these pat ients include chemotherapy and checkpo int inhibitors (PD -1 or PD -L1 
antibody ). The efficacy o f platinum doublet chemo therapy  is not impacted by [CONTACT_738076]; 
however, the benefits of doublet therapy  are limi ted wi th response rates about 30% and median 
PFS about 4 m onths [29]. Checkpo int inhibitors have recent ly become available as treatment for 
NSCLC. These agents are particularly effective in patients whose tumors over -express PD -L1 and 
have less benefit in pat ients with EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangements [
30], possibly related to 
the low m utation burden in this populat ion. Of note, patients with ALK+ NSCLC are often 
nonsmokers, which may help to explain the low mutation burden [31].
Clinicians treating patients with ALK+ NSCLC with metastatic disease need to know the benefit, 
in months, of one next generation ALK inhibitor versus another in terms of PFS, time to 
intracranial  progressi on wi thout pri or systemic progressio n (iPD), durati on of  response (DOR), 
and intracranial duration o f response (iDOR). These measures represent time free of int ervent ions 
such as radiotherapy or surgery . The likelihood of response as assessed by [CONTACT_738077], ORR, and intracranial object ive response rate (iORR) are also important factors in 
clinical decisio n making. Given that the majorit y of these patients will have had CNS metastases, 
the intracranial data obtained from this study  will be of particular value in determining the best 
therapeuti c opti on for that large subset of patients with brain metastases present at the init iation of 
therapy. This study (the primary analysis) will provide the CNS data to address this unmet medica l 
need. 
Brigatinib
Brigatinib (AP26113) is a novel, orally administered TKI discovered and developed by [CONTACT_738078], Inc (ARIAD; Cambridge, [LOCATION_005] ), a wholly owned subsidiary o f [COMPANY_005] 
Pharmaceut ical Co mpany Limited. Primary targets are activated, mutant forms o f ALK and ROS1 , 
which play  important rol es in NSCLC and other cancers. 
A ser ies of in vitro and in vivo studies demo nstrated that brigat inib potently inhibited ALK activit y 
and pro liferat ion in ALK+ cell lines and exhibited >[ADDRESS_1008459] ivity over ALK -negat ive lines. 
In clinical studies, brigat inib has an acceptable safety profile at the recommended dose of 90 mg 
once daily  (QD) f or 7 day s, then 180 m g QD, continuously (hereinafter mentioned as 90 mg QD 
→180 mg QD). Brigat inib at this dose level exhibited substantial efficacy in pat ients with ALK+ 
NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib. In 110 patients, the confirmed response rate was 56.4% 
(62 of 110, 97.5% CI: 45.2, 67.0) by [CONTACT_107406] (IRC) assessment. The IRC 
assessed median DOR was 15.7 months (95% CI: 12.8, 21.8 event rate: 54.8%) and median PFS

CONFIDENTIALwas 16.7 months (95% CI: 11.6, 21.4, event rate: 49.1%). High IRC -assess ed iORR (66.7%, 12/18, 
95% CI: 41.0, 86.7) with a median 16.6 month (95% CI: 3.7, not reached) iDOR was also observed 
in patients with measurable baseline brain metastases by [CONTACT_55543] (ALTA study , data cut- off: 29 
September 2017, data on file). On 28 April 2017 , the FDA granted accelerated approval to 
brigatinib for the treatment of pat ients with metastati c ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or 
are intolerant of crizotinib. 
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Crizotinib has been approved by  [CONTACT_738079] n Medicines Agency (EMA) for 
first-line treatment of advanced ALK+ NSCLC, after 2 phase 3 clinical studies demo nstrated a 
significant PFS benefit over chemotherapy [32,33] . Since crizotinib was approved for first -line 
treatm ent of advanced ALK+ NSCLC, several newer ALK inhibitors with greater efficacy and 
tolerabilit y have been developed and approved for this pat ient populat ion. 
The newer ALK inhibitors, ceritinib, alect inib, and brigat inib, have been shown to be of benefit in 
a postcrizotinib setting. Cerit inib received accelerated approval by [CONTACT_163881] 2014, and was 
approved in the EU in May 2015, in patients previously treated with crizotinib [
34-36] . In a phase 
2 study  of ceritinib, pati ents who had progressed on crizotinib showed an ORR of 38.6% and a 
median PFS of 5.7 months [
35]. In patients with intracranial brain metastases, the iORR was 33% 
[
35]. Alectinib was granted accelerated approval in the US in December 2015 for patients with 
ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. In 2017, alect inib received 
condi tional market ing authorization fro m the EMA in pat ients with ALK+ NSCLC previously 
treate d with crizotinib. In [ADDRESS_1008460] inib has been shown to be well tolerated by  
[CONTACT_1962]. The ORR based on IRC assessment was 38% and 44% in studies 1 and 2, respectively 
[
37-39] . Median PFS was approximately 9 months [ 38]. In patients with intracran ial CNS 
metastases (N = 51), the iORR was 61%, with a median duration of CNS response of 9.1 months 
[
24]. Brigat inib received accelerated approval by [CONTACT_163881] 2017 for the treatment of 
patients wi th metastati c ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant of crizotinib. 
Brigatinib’s accelerated approval was based on efficacy seen in a 2 -arm,open -label, mult icenter 
trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] [ALTA]). In this study , pati ents wi th ALK+ NSCLC who had progressed on 
crizotinib demo nstrated an IRC assessed ORR of 51% in patients given 90 mg QD (Arm A; 
N
=112) and 55% in pat ients who were given 180 mg QD w ith a 7 -day lead in at 90 m g QD 
(Arm B; N =110). The IRC- assessed median DOR was 13.8 months in Ar m A and 14.8 months in 
Arm B. IRC -assessed PFS was 9.2 months in Arm A and 16.7 months in Arm B. In patients with 
measurable brain metastases, the iORR was 5 0% (N =26) in Arm A and 67% (N =18) in Arm B, 
and median iDOR was not reached in Arm A and was 16.[ADDRESS_1008461] line 
therapy  in separate phase 3 open -label studi es. Alectinib demonstrated a PFS advantage in 
previously untreated advanced ALK+ NSCLC; HR for disease progression or death, 0.47 [95% CI, 
0.34 to 0.65]; p<0.001 [26]. Brigat inib is being compared with crizotinib in patients with advanced 
ALK+ NSCLC treated with 1or fewer lines of systemic chemotherapy in the phase 3 rando mized

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a phase 3, randomized, open -label, comparative, mult icenter, international study  in which 
patients wi th ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on crizotinib wi ll be rando mized in a 
1:1fashion to receive brigat inib in Arm A or alect inib in Arm  B. Pati ents will  be stratified by [CONTACT_738085] (Yes versus No) and best prior response to 
crizotinib therapy  as assessed by [CONTACT_3170] (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR] 
vs any other response/status unknown). 
Patients will be treated on each arm unt il they experience progressive disease (PD) assessed by [CONTACT_738086] y, or until any other discont inuat ion criterion is met. On each arm,  
treatm ent will be given cont inuously. For logist ical convenience, every 28 days is defined as 
1cycle. Continuat ion of study  drug bey ond progressio n is permitted, if there is potential for 
continued clinical b enefi t (eg, absence of clinical symptoms or signs, indicating clinically  
significant disease progression requiring alternat ive systemic ant icancer therapy; no decline in 
perform ance status; absence of rapid disease progressio n or threat to vital organs or critical 
anatomical sites [eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_637706] n, spi[INVESTIGATOR_53894] n]

conducted once 70% of PFS events have been observed. It is expected that enrollment will be 
completed before reaching IA. 
AEs will be assessed fro m the time a patient signs the informed consent form (ICF) unt il [ADDRESS_1008466] dose of the study drug a patient receives. Patients’ signs and symptoms, laboratory values, 
vital signs, ECGs, and any other relevant special examinat ions as clinically indicated will be 
obtained to evaluate the safet y and tol erabili ty of brigatinib. For patients randomized to the 
brigatinib arm of the study (Arm A), sparse PK samples will be co llected during the study to 
measure plasma concentrations of brigat inib as outlined in Appendix A, PK Sam pling Schedule. 
Before randomizat ion, ALK status must be confirmed with documentation fro m a pat hology  report 
of ALK+ tum or tissue. If the determinat ion of ALK posit ivity was m ade by  a non -FDA -approved 
test, tumor tissue (archival or new biopsy) must be submitted to a central laboratory  for ALK
rearrangement testing. Central laboratory  resul ts of ALK testing are not required to be available 
before rando mizat ion. Given that all pat ients are required to ha ve received therapy with crizotinib, 
it is not deem ed necessary  that central  laboratory  tests be in agreement with local ALK tests (i t is 
anticipated that the central laboratory  will have an intrinsic false negative rate).
For pati ents f or whom  there i s available form alin-fixed, paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue 
that was acquired after progression on crizotinib, a sample will be requested for exploratory  
molecular genet ic analysis. In patients without such tissue available, an optional biopsy for 
explor atory  molecular genetic analysis may  be obtained during screening if the patient has an 
amenable lesio n. An optional biopsy will be obtained at the time of disease progression for patients 
who consent to the procedure and genetic test ing of the sample. FFP E tumor tissue will be used for 
exploratory  molecular genetic analysis. For all patients, blood samples will be obtained for 
exploratory  biomarker studi es, including mo lecular genetic analysis, according to the Schedule of 
Events 
(Appendix A).
Toxicit y will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 
14June 2010 [40].
6.2 Number of Patients

Reintroducing Brigatinib After Dose Interruption
If brigatinib treatment interruption lasts ≥14 days, and prior dose was >90 mg QD, patients should 
resum e treatm ent at 90 m g QD f or 7 day s, before escalat ing dose back to their previous treatment 
dose, 120 mg QD or 180 mg QD. The dose should not be escalated higher than the prior dose level 
before treatment interrupt ion. If an AE does not resolve to baseline after dose interruption for more 
than 28 days, the sponsor’s medical mo nitor must be contact[CONTACT_738091].
Re-escalation of Brigatinib After Dose Reduction
Re-escalat ion after dose modifi cation for AEs i s discouraged. However, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the 
treating invest igator re -escalat ion is warranted, this must be undertaken after consultation with the 
sponsor. To be a candidate for re -escalat ion, the AE that led to dose modificat ion must not have 
recurred, and no other AEs of Grade [ADDRESS_1008492] been observed during the preceding 28 days.
Pulmonary Adverse Reactions and Other AEs
During early clinical development of brigatinib, moderate and severe pulmo nary AEs (eg, dyspnea, 
hypoxia, cou gh, pneumonia, and pneumo nitis) were observed shortly after init iation o f the drug in 
a subset of patients. These events were termed early onset pulmo nary events (EOPE).
In the ALTA study  (AP26113-13- 201) for bri gatinib, as of 21 February 2017, of 219 treated 
patients, there were 14 cases of EOPE (6.4%). All cases occurred at a dose of 90 mg QD. No 
EOPEs were ident ified after escalation to 180 mg QD in the 90 mg QD →180 mg QD dose group, 
or after re -initiation following study  treatm ent interrupti on. Medi an time of onset of EOPE was 
Day 2 (range: 1 -9). Eleven of these 14 cases were reported as SAEs. Seven pat ients had events that 
were Grade ≥3, all o f whom permanent ly discontinued brigat inib because of these events. One 
patient had an EOPE that was Grade 5 (pneumonia).
Pulmo nary events occurring within the first [ADDRESS_1008493] tightness, and presumpt ive lung infection (pneumo nia) should 
be monitored and reported. To reiterate, some even ts occur after a single dose of brigat inib, and 
physicians should be aware of this possibilit y and di scuss i t with patients. Newly developed or 
worsening of pulmo nary symptoms in the first week of study  drug administration, specifically  
with hypoxia and gr ound gl ass opaci ty on radi ographic imaging indicat ive of interst itial lung 
disease or pneum onitis, coul d suggest a rel ationship to brigatinib after other etio logies, including 
pulmo nary embo lism, rapi d disease progressi on, and infect ious pneumo nia are rul ed out. If no

Re-escalation of Alectinib After Dose Reduction
Re-escalat ion of alect inib after dose modificat ion for AEs is discouraged; how ever, if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the treating investigator, re -escalat ion is warranted, this must be undertaken after 
consultation wit h the sponsor.
In order for a patient to be a candidate for dose re -escalat ion, the AE that led to dose modificat ion 
must not ha ve reoccurred after alectinib was resumed at the decreased dose, and the patient must 
have had no other Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1008497] inib may be resum ed at the same dose if alectinib was held for reasons other than an adverse 
reacti on. If an AE does not resolve to baseline after dose interrupti on for more than 28 days, the 
sponsor’s medical mo nitor must be contact[CONTACT_738092].
8.4 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
Any medicat ion, given for any reason, during any t ime period fro m the time a patient signs the ICF 
up to 30 days after the final treatment with study drug will be considered a concomitant medicat ion. 
Palliat ive therapy and supportive care are permitte d during the study for management of symptoms 
and underlying medical condit ions that may develo p during the study. This may include blood and 
blood products and growth factors as clinically  needed.
8.5 Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Systemic t reatm ent with the fo llowing medicat ions should be avo ided during the study  for patients 
taking brigat inib due to the risk of drug
-drug interactions:
Strong CYP3A inhibitors: boceprevir, clarithro mycin, cobicistat, conivaptan, 
grapefruit -containing products including grapefruit juice, idelalisib, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazo le, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir,

progression is obs erved:
–Any other systemic ant icancer therapy  including, but not limited to: chemotherapeutic 
agents, immunotherapy , biological response m odifiers (excluding growth factors), 
radiotherapy , and/or systemic hormonal therapy (with the exception of local therap ies, 
such as SRS, used for palliat ive or symptomat ic control of exist ing lesio ns, wi th 
appropriate treatment interruption at the discretion of the invest igator).
–Use of any  other invest igational drug or device.
Any illicit substance. (Note: medical use of cannabis is allowed if it is legal where the patient 
resides and no al ternative treatm ent is available. The case must be reviewed and agreed to by

Use of alternat ive or herbal ther apy must be approved by  [CONTACT_738093].
8.6 Precautions and Restrictions
Brigatinib induces CYP3A in vitro and may decrease concentrations of CYP3A substrates.
Coadministration of brigat inib wit h CYP3A substrates, including hormonal c ontraceptives, can 
resul t in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy  of CYP3A substrates. Brigat inib may also 
induce other enzymes and transporters (eg, CYP2C, P -glycoprotein [P -gp]) vi a the same 
mechanism responsible for induct ion of CYP3A (eg, preg nane X receptor activat ion). Therefore, 
additional mo nitoring should be considered for patients receiving substrates of these enzymes and 
transporters with a narrow therapeuti c index during treatment with brigat inib as their effect iveness 
may be reduced.

Patients shoul d be cl osely  monitored when brigat inib is coadministere d with substrates of these 
transporters with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin, dabigatran, methotrexate) as their 
plasma concentrations may be increased.
Photosensit ivity to sunlight has occurred in pat ients treated with brigatinib. Patients should be 
advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking brigat inib, and for at least [ADDRESS_1008500] -spectrum ultraviolet A (UVA)/ ultravio let B (UVB) 
sunscreen and lip balm (SPF [sun protecti on factor] 30) to help protect against potential sunburn. 
For severe photosensit ivity react ions (Gr ade ≥3), bri gatinib should be withheld unt il recovery to 
baseline. The dose should be modified accordingly (see the “other”AE in the dose modification 
guidelines in Table 8.b).
8.6.1 Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Contraception
[IP_ADDRESS] Brigatinib
It is not known what effects brigat inib has on human pregnancy  or devel opment of the embry o or

The HRQL assessments (EORTC QLQ -C30, QLQ- LC13, and QLQ -BN20) will be completed by  
[CONTACT_738103] o f Events ( Appendix A). The EORTC QLQ -C30 
incorporates [ADDRESS_1008536] ional scales (physical functioning, role funct ioning, em otional functioning, 
cogni tive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global healt h status scale, 3 symptom scales 
(fatigue, nausea and vo miting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, inso mnia, appetite loss, 
constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies).
The l ung cancer specific module QL Q-LC13 co mprises 13 questions assessing lung cancer 
associ ated symptom s (cough, hemopt ysis, dyspnea, and site -specific pain), treatment -related si de 
effects (sore mouth, dy sphagia, peri pheral neuropathy , and al opecia), and use of pain medication. 
This will be administered subsequent to the EORTC QLQ -C30.
To reduce the clinical site and respondent burden, 5 items from the brain cancer module 
QLQ -BN20 will be used to assess morbidit y related to CNS symptoms, including headaches (item 
4), coordination (item 15), and communicat ion deficit (items 11, 12, and 13). This will be 
administered subsequent to the EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LC13.

10.1.[ADDRESS_1008548]; 
the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this

laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the

An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is considered 
by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change fro m baseline.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  does not need to be reported as

AE Severity
The severit y of AEs will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 (see the study manual ). If 
the AE i s not defined in the NCI CTCAE, the investigator will determine the severit y of the AE 
based on the fo llowing definit ions:
Mild (grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine activit y.
Moderate (grade 2): T he AE interferes wit h routine activit y but responds to symptomat ic 
therapy  or rest.
Severe (grade 3): The AE significant ly limits the patient’s abilit y to perform routine act ivities

In thi s study , severi ty for each AE, incl uding any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Versi on 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [40].Clarificat ion should be 
made between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because 
the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to 
describe the inte nsity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of  
relatively minor m edical  significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as 
serious , which i s based on pati ent/event outcom e or action criteria described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to funct ion. A 
severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a 
white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considere d Grade 3 (severe) but may 
not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.

docum ent will provi de further details regarding the definit ion of analysis variables and analysis 
methodol ogy to address all stu dy objectives.
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
Full Analysis Set
The full analysis set is based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle and includes all pat ients 
rando mized to each regimen regardless of whether they are ALK+ by [CONTACT_738112] (D5F3) CDx Assay, Foundat ion Medicine’s 
Foundat ionOneCDx or a local test other than FISH and immunohistochemistry , or whether they  
receive study  drug or adhere to the assigned dose. The primary  analyses of efficacy  will be based 
on the full an alysis set.
Safety Analysis Set
The safet y analys is set for each regimen includes all patients receiving at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Safety will be analyzed using the safet y analysis set.

Rationale for Amendment 3
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 3. The 
primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Change the legal entit y of the sponsor and the na me of  study  lead due to a company level 
change. 
Incorporate the recommendation fro m the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the endpo int of “time to intracranial disease progression (iPD),” which will no 
longer be a key  secondary  endpoint and was remo ved fro m hierarchical testing. The ordering 
of secondary  objectives and endpoints were revised to reflect this change.
Provi de cl arificat ion for some of the protocol language.
In thi s amendment, minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, a nd administrative changes not 
affect ing the conduct of the study  are included for clarification and administrative purposes only.
Changes in Amendment 3
The fo llowing i s a summary  of changes made in the amendment:
Updated sponsor informat ion from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc to [COMPANY_005] Development 
Center Am ericas, Inc.
Changed the clinical study  lead to 
, MD, on signatory  page.
Removed “t ime to intracranial progressive disease (iPD)” fro m the key  secondary  endpoints 
and revised the order of other seco ndary  endpoints. The order of secondary  objectives was 
revised to match the order of key  and other secondary  endpoints.
Clarified throughout the protocol that the treatment will cont inue unt il “progressive disease 
(PD) assessed by  [CONTACT_3170].”
Removed statem ents about “End of Study /Study  Com pletion Definit ion, and Planned 
Reporting,” “Primary  Com pletion/Study  Com pletion,” and “Study  Com pletion,” and unified 
the terms in Section 6.3.1 for the definit ion of “End of Study” and “Primary  Com pletion.”
Speci fied that timing for exclusio n criteria 2 (crizotinib use) and 7 (chemotherapy or radiatio n 
therapy ) was before rando mizat ion.

Clarified requi rement that both bri gatinib and alectinib be administered at approximately the
same time every  day and added detail regarding dose -limit ing AEs.
Clarificat ion for dose modification for AEs andclarificat ions that if the brigatinib dose cannot
be escalated to 180 mg QD due to AE, 90 mg QD should be administered throughout the study.
Clarificat ion for pulmo nary events occurring within the first 7 day s of treatm ent regarding
ruling out other etiol ogies including rapid disease progression for assessing relat ion to
treatm ent.
Clarificat ion for alectinib dose discont inuat ion due to AEs.
Provi ded addi tional information regarding the use of moderate CYP3A inducers and
alternat ive or herbal therapy after consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_456].

than PD.
Corrected total blood volume co llection for DNA measurements.
Added requirement for acknowledgment of receipt when reporting AEs and SAEs by
[CONTACT_6972].
The secondary  endpoint analyses were revised to reflect that iPD will no longer be a key
secondary  endpoint and was removed from hierarchical testing.
Minor edi torial revisi ons were m ade for cl arificat ion throughout the document.
Rationale for Amendment 2
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 2. The 
primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Change the current secondary  endpoint for intracranial progressio n-free survival (iPFS) to
time to intracranial progression (iPD) without prior sy stemic progression per advice fro m the
[LOCATION_002] Food and D rug Administration (US FDA).
To cl arify the dose m odificat ion table for treatment -related adverse events ( Table 8.b) and
provi de consistency with the Com pany Core Data Sheet (CCDS) for brigat inib and to provide
clarity on all owed dose levels.

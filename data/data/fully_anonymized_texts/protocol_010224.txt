Objective.  Ghrelin is a 28 -amino acid peptide acting as the endogenous ligand for the growth 
hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS -R). Ghrelin stimulates appetite by [CONTACT_288427] (ARC), a region that controls the intake of food and other 
substances, inclu ding alcohol. In addition to the ARC, GHS receptors (GHS -Rs) are also highly 
expressed in the caudal brain stem, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), hippocampus, substantia 
nigra, and dorsal and medial raphe nuclei. The expression of the GHS -R in the mesolim bic 
dopamine (DA) pathway suggests that ghrelin could  play a role in  reward processing . The role of 
ghrelin in the DA reward processing  and the role of the DA reward system in alcoholism suggest 
a role of ghrelin in alcoholism. Consistent with this hypothesis, preclinical studies demonstrate 
that both ghrelin and ethanol activate the cholinergic -dopaminergic reward link, implying 
neurochemical analogies between ghrelin and ethanol. This supports t he hypothesis that ghrelin 
is involved in mediating the rewarding properties of ethanol. Additional animal experiments  
demonstrate that the central ghrelin action not only stimulates the reward processing  but is also 
required for stimulation of that system  by [CONTACT_131128]. Human studies show reduced ghrelin levels in 
actively drinking alcoholics; increased ghrelin levels during alcohol abstinence; and a positive 
correlation between ghrelin level and alcohol craving scores. More recently, a study conducted at 
Brown University by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_288383]-treatment seeking alcohol -dependent heavy drinking individuals. Furthermore, a preliminary 
interim analysis shows that IV ghrelin administration may lead to a temporary significant 
increase in alcohol craving.  
The primary objective of this protocol is to investigate whether IV ghrelin , as compared to 
placebo,  will increase motivation for alcohol reward, as measured by a progressive ratio (PR) 
schedule paradigm with IV alcohol self -infusion  (primary aim) . We will also assess a number of 
secondary aims. Specifically, w e will also assess whether IV ghrelin, as compared to placebo, 
will also a lter urges to drink and the subjective response to  IV alcohol. Adverse events will also 
be assessed to ensure the safety of the IV co -administration of ghrelin and alcohol. During an 
“fMRI/alcohol clamp ” session, fMRI will be used to see whether ghrelin affects the activation of 
the ventral striatum induced b y acute IV alcohol administration and the incentive salience of cues 
associated with alcohol administration.  
Study Population.  Male and female participants will be non -treatment seeking heavy drinking 
volunteers.  
Design.  The study is designed as a within -subject, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 
ghrelin. The first visit will be the initial screening visit. The second and third visits will be PR 
sessions  with IV ethanol , during which each participant will also receive IV ghrelin (or matched 
placebo) . The fourth and fifth visits will combine an fMRI session with an ‘alcohol clamp’ 
session  (i.e. a fixed dose of alcohol will be administered)  and subjects will participate in a 
modified version of the monetary incentive delay (MID ) task in which they will  respond to cues 
that indicate the opportunity to press a button to gain a reward. On some trials the reward will be 
points that ca n be exchanged for snack foods  while on other trials the reward will be points that 
[ADDRESS_351468] will be given during the “alcohol clamp” 
procedure which will immediately follow the modified MID task. After the modified MID task is 
complete subjects will have a short break and the n begin the alcohol IV infusion . 
Outcome measures.  The primary measure of this study will be the breakpoint, which is the 
schedule (number of button presses) at which the individual stops to work for more alcohol. 
Also, the BrAC exposure measures will be determined. Al cohol craving in response to ghrelin  
will be measured using the Alcohol Visual Analogue Scale (A -VAS)  and the Alcohol Urge 
Questionnaire (AUQ) during the PR sessions. S ensitivity to alcohol will be measured using the 
Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ), Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale  (BAES ), and the Profile of 
Mood States (POMS), repeatedly during the PR session s and the CASE Experience 
Questionnaire (CEQ) at the end of all sessions . fMRI BOLD signal in brain areas associated with 
incentive salience and areas associated with reward circuitry (includin g the ventral striatum) will 
be measured during the “ fMRI/alcohol clamp ” session.  This study may facilitate the 
identification of a novel neuropharmacological target, thus facilitating the development of novel 
pharmacological treatments  for alcoholism .

1. Introduction  
There exist commonalities over -eating and over -consumption of alcohol .1-21 Like alcoholism, 
obesity and binge eating are complex genetic traits determined by [CONTACT_288429], and interacting 
with the environment. It is also notable that medications used to treat alcohol dependence (AD) 
often result in weight loss in other populations. Naltrexone, topi[INVESTIGATOR_288384]/or eating disorders22. In recent years there has been an interest 
in the role of ghrelin in food -seeking behavior. Animal studies have shown that ghrelin is 
involved in the central dopaminergic reward processing  and human studies have shown a direct 
relationship between ghrelin and alcohol craving. The overall conclusion is that the ghrelin 
system deserves human investigations in alcoholism , as detailed next . 
Ghrelin. 
Ghrelin is a 28 -amino acid peptide acting as the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone 
secretagogue receptor (GHS -R), a G -protein coupled receptor that induces  growth hormone (GH) 
release from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] .1 The n -octanoyl bearing ghrelin is know n as active ghrelin (acylated), 
although the des -acylated ghrelin is not totally inactive .[ADDRESS_351471] already used ghrelin intravenous ( IV) both in 
healthy controls (Table 1) and in subjects with chronic diseases (Table 2). All of these studies 
have demo nstrated the safety of IV ghrelin  in humans as detailed next.

Pharmacokinetic Profile . Because ghrelin is degraded in the digestive tract, ghrelin cannot be 
administered orally. Studies in healthy controls32-[ADDRESS_351472] used bolus IV ghrelin doses range from 
1 to 10 μg/kg, and continuous ghrelin infusion rates from 3.4 to 16.9 ng/kg/min.  
The concentration -dependence of ghrelin kinetics may contri bute to some disparities in results, 
as suggested by [CONTACT_288430]35. Mean terminal half -life estimates for total ghrelin vary from as low 
as 10 min to as high as 47 min after bolus injection and 1 46 min after constant infusion. After 
constant infusion, the peak plasma concentrations (C max) are 1058.7 (882.6 - 1234.8) fmol/ml 
8 
 when 1 mcg/kg ghrelin is infused and 6597.9 (5919 - 7276.6) fmol/ml when 5 mcg/kg total 
ghrelin is infused33. After bolus injection, C max is of 4438 ± 407pg/mL after 1 mcg/kg ghrelin is 
injected, and of 8176 ± 273 after 3 mcg/kg ghrelin in injected35. Bolus and steady -state infusions 
of ghrelin yield concentration -dependent (median) estimates of the metabolic clearance rate 
(MCR) of blood ghrelin35. 
 
 
IV Ghrelin  in healthy subjects (Table 1  above ).32-69 
Studies testing IV ghrelin  in healthy subjects demonstrate that IV ghrelin  reproduces 
physiological effects similar to that of endogenous ghr elin, e.g.: increased appetite, 
gastrointestinal motility. All the studi es clearly demonstrate  the safety of IV ghrelin either 
infused over time or given as a bolus. Described adverse events (AEs, e.g.:  
hypotension, diarrhoea, flushing, somnolence) were sporadic and transitory with a rapid and 
spontaneous resolution. There we re no serious adverse events (SAEs) after IV ghrelin , nor AEs 
requiring medical intervention or the cess ation of IV ghrelin  infusion.  
 
IV G hrelin in no n-healthy subjects (Table 2 b elow)44-46;48,49,51,52,67,69,[ADDRESS_351473] tested IV ghrelin in subjects with severe chronic diseases, including 
patients afflicted with cancer cachexia . For example, IV ghrelin significantly decreased blood 
pressure (BP) without significant changes in heart rate (HR) in patients with chronic heart 
failure70. IV Ghrelin also reverses endothelium dysfunction in patients with metabolic 
syndrome77 and increases gastric emptying in patients with diabetic gastroparesis78. Studie s on 
the role of IV ghrelin in appetite are described below .

Rationale for studying the ghrelin system in alcohol dependence . 
Ghrelin stimulates appetite by [CONTACT_288431] (ARC), a region that 
controls the intake of food and other substances, including alcohol. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_288385], which 
play a role in the reinforcing effects of alcohol, also are located in the ARC90. Plasma levels of 
ghrelin are higher under fasting conditions and prior to meals, indicating that ghrelin transmits a 
hunger signal from the periphery to the brain  and participates in  meal initiation91. Plasma ghrelin 
levels then fall to minimum levels within 1 hour after eating92. In addition to the ARC, GHS 
receptors (GHS -Rs) are also highly expressed in the caudal brain stem, the ventral tegmental area 
(VTA), hip pocampus, substantia nigra, and dorsal and medial raphe nuclei93-95. The expression 
of the GHS -R in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway suggests that ghrelin could play a role 
in the  reward processing .3,4  
Feeding behaviour, DA release and locomotor stimu lation are triggered following intra -VTA 
microinfusion of ghrelin into either the VTA or nucleus accumbens (NAc)96 and intracerebral 
ventricular (ICV ) administration97. Kawahara and colleagues98 demonstrated that ghrelin : i) 
administered to rats into the VTA induced DA release in the NAc and food consumption; and ii) 
administered to rats (without food deprivation) peripherally induced a robust increase of DA 
levels in the NAc and this stimulatory effect of ghrelin primarily re quired activation of GHS -Rs 
in the VTA. Furthermore, subcutaneous  administration of ghrelin in rats produced a significant 
increase in extracellular levels of DA in the NAc shell, but not in the NAc core99. These results 
suggest that the mesolimbic DA processing  is implicated in the effects of ghrelin on food -
seeking behaviour2. The role of the DA processing  in the neurobiology of alcohol and other drug 
dependence is well known. In particular, cortico -mesolimbic DA pathways may mediate Table 2. Studies in non -healthy subjects

 alcohol’s rewarding e ffects (including craving) associated with its abuse liability20,[ADDRESS_351474] in studies 
testing IV ghrelin . For example, Schmid et al .47 demonstrated  that a single bolus injection of 
ghrelin acutely increases appetite, as well as ideas about food in healthy subjects . IV Ghrelin  also 
increases appetite in patients with chronic diseases, such as cancer -related ano rexia75, dyspepsia -
related anorexia83, obesity46 and g eriatric frailty69. 
In summary: i) in rats, ghrelin increases food consumption and in humans, IV ghrelin  increases 
appetite; ii) in rats, ghrelin acts centrally modulating the DA reward processing ; and iii) the DA 
reward processing  regulates appetite .[ADDRESS_351475] processing . Moreover: i) alcohol and food -seeking behaviour share the s ame 
neurobiological mechanisms;108 and ii) b oth alcohol  and food exert their reinforcing effects in 
part by [CONTACT_288432]. Thus, the role of ghrelin in the DA reward processing  
and the role of the DA reward processing  in alcoholism suggest a role of ghrelin in alcoholism. It 
is important to keep in mind that the mechanisms regulating alcohol -seeking behaviours are 
multiple and complex. In fact, alcohol and drugs of abuse activate the mesolimbic DA 
processing , but much evidence suggests that dopamine -independent reinforcement  occurs at the 
level of the nucleus accumbens, suggesting multiple inputs to the activation of critical 
reinforcement circuitry in these brain regions.109 Brain arousal/stress systems in the extended 
amygdala may be key components of the negative emotional  states that drive dependence on 
alcohol and drugs of abuse. Furthermore, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) also plays a 
key role in the acute reinforcing actions of drugs of abuse; in fact, c ompulsive alcohol and drug 
use is mediated by [CONTACT_288433] l oss of function of reward systems but also recruitment of brain 
stress systems such as corticotropin -releasing factor (CRF) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in areas 
such as the amygdala. 110,[ADDRESS_351476], and NPY with anxiolytic properties. As widely described by [CONTACT_288434]’s lab,109,[ADDRESS_351477]/motivation behavior and reported 
that the ventricular ghrelin -induced increase in sucrose -motivated behavior and chow intake 
were suppressed by [CONTACT_288435] -Y1R antagonist or naltrexone. 
Furthermore, ghrelin infusion w as associated with elevated VTA -opi[INVESTIGATOR_288386]. As 
such, this study provided evidence of the role of central NPY and opio id signaling as key 
mediators of food intake and reward effects of ghrelin. On the other and, Naleid and colleagues 
[ADDRESS_351478] on feeding behavior was independent from 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_288387]. Additional  evidence was provided by [CONTACT_288436]115 who 
used ghrelin knockout mice to investigate anxious behavior and hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal 
axis (HPA) responses to acute stress. In this study, the authors found that ghrelin reduces anxiety 
[ADDRESS_351479] link.  
Ghrelin administration into the VTA increases  extracellular concentrations of accumbal DA in 
mice4. The non -selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine 
attenuates the stimulatory and DA -enhancing effects of ghrelin infused into the third ventricle97, 
indicating that nAChRs mediates these neurochemical properties of ghrelin; nAChRs also 
mediate the locomotor stimulatory and DA -enhancing properties of ghrelin administered into the 
VTA117. Taken together, these studies suggest that ghrelin activates the cholinergic -
dopaminergic reward link and that ventral tegmental nAChRs have a central role for the DA -
enhancing properties of ghrelin. Only some specific nAChR subtypes (alpha3 -beta2, beta3, 
alpha6) are  implicated in the central rewarding actions of ghrelin117. Interestingly, the same 
nAchR s (alpha3 -beta2, beta3) mediate  an increase in ventral tegmental ACh and accumbal DA 
levels after voluntary ethanol consumption118-119. Ghrelin administered into the lateral 
hypothalamus or paraventricular nucleus has no effects on ethanol consumption120, confirming 
that ghrelin works in specific brain reward nodes (i.e., VTA). P eripherally injected ghrelin also 
activates brain reward pa rameters, such as locomotor  activity, accumbal -DA release and 
conditioned place preference (CPP)121. 
In summary, these preclinical studies demonstrate that both ghrelin and ethanol activate the 
cholinergic -dopaminergic reward link, support ing the hypothesi s that ghrelin is involved in 
mediating the rewarding properties of ethanol.  
 
Requirement of central ghrelin signaling for alcohol reward . 
Another set of experiments122 demonstrated that: i) alcohol -induced brain reward parameters, 
such as enhanced extracellular accumbal DA overflow (a measure reflecting synaptic DA 
release), locomotor stimulation and CPP were consistently abolished or attenuated by [CONTACT_288437] -
R1A antagonists in wild -type mice and were abolished in GHS -R1A knockout mice ; ii) ICV 
adminis tration of ghrelin to mice significantly increased alcohol consumption compared to 
vehicle treatment in a 2 -bottle (alcohol/water) free choice limited access paradigm. Bilateral 
administration of ghrelin into either the VTA or the laterodorsal tegmental ar ea (LDTg) also 
increased alcohol consumption in comparison to vehicle. The percentage increase in alcohol 
consumption was significantly greater following administration to the VTA or the LDTg 
compared to the ICV route. Food intake (normal chow) was increas ed by [CONTACT_288438]. This observation is particularly relevant as it may shed light on 
the specific role of ghrelin in alcohol -seeking behavior, as opposed to a non -specific role of 
ghrelin in appetitive behaviors. In fact, ICV administration of ghrelin significantly increased 
alcohol consumption as well as food intake . On the other hand , when ghrelin was administered 
directly into either the VTA or the LDTg , then only alcohol consumption was increased, while 
food intake was not affected. Interestingly, t he percentage increase in alcohol consumption was 
12 
 significantly greater following administration to the VTA or the LDTg compared to  the ICV 
route , thus suggesting that ghrelin’s actions via reward areas (VTA, LDTg) are somewhat 
specifically related to alcohol reward and not simply secondary to its effect on appetite.  
Alcohol intake in the 2 -bottle (alcohol/water) free choice limited a ccess paradigm was 
suppressed in mice by [CONTACT_288439] -R1A antagonists [delivered either ICV or intraperitoneal 
(IP)]. The effects of ICV  ghrelin on alcohol intake were absent in GHS -R1A knockout mice.  
In summary, using genetic and pharmacological models of  suppressed ghrelin signaling, these 
studies  demonstrate that the central ghrelin action not only stimulates the reward system but is 
also required for stimulation of that system by [CONTACT_131128].  
 
Human Studies on Ghrelin in alcoholic individuals:  
Ghrelin, alcohol intake and craving.  
Alcohol, compared to water, significantly reduces ghrelin levels in healthy subjects123-124. 
Zimmermann et al .125 showed  a significant reduction of blood ghrelin levels after alcohol 
ingestion in healthy subjects but unchanged ghrelin levels after a laboratory stressor exposure. 
Preliminary studies r eported that actively drinking alcohol -dependent patients (with an alcohol 
intake within 24 hrs) show lower plasma ghre lin levels compared to controls5,126. On the other 
hand, other studies demonstrated a significant increase of ghrelin in abstinent alcoholics127-128. 
All together, these studies suggest that ghrelin is suppressed by [CONTACT_288440]. O ne of these studies also reported a significant positive correlation 
between plasma ghrelin levels and the Obsessive -Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) craving 
scores in actively drinking alcoholics5. Interestingly, ghrelin was positively correlate d with the 
Compulsive but not with the Obsessive subscore of the OCDS5. This last finding is consistent 
with the role of ghrelin in modulating food intake and with the observation that compulsion 
reflects the behavioral reward mechanisms of addictive disor ders like eating disorders129. 
Successive human studies have confirmed, at least partially, the relationship between plasma 
ghrelin levels and alcohol craving. In particular, Hillemacher et al.130 reported a significant 
relationship between ghrelin and OCD S score in an alcoholic subtype (Lesch type 1) 
characterized by a positive family history of alcoholism. Wurst et al.131 found a  relationship 
between ghrelin levels and the OCDS compulsive sub score in female alcoholics. Recently, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_288388] a stud y with alcohol -dependent individuals132, where plasma ghrelin levels were 
determined several times  – the first longitudinal study testing repeated blood ghrelin 
determinations in a sample of alcohol -dependent individuals . Baseline ghrelin (T0) was taken 
after [ADDRESS_351480] of alcohol on ghrelin levels  as 
a possible confounding factor . Then, ghrelin  was re -tested after 2 weeks (T1), 6 weeks (T2) and 
12 weeks (T3 ). Results s howed a relationship between ghrelin, alcohol intake and craving.[ADDRESS_351481], a comparison of non -abstinent vs. abstinent (during the 12 weeks) subjects showed that:  
i) non -abstinent subjects had higher ghrelin levels, which went down during the 12 -week pe riod 
(consistent with the inhibitory effect of alcohol on ghrelin5,123-126); ii) in abstinent subjects 
ghrelin levels increased during the 12 -week period, as previously show n127-128; iii) there was a 
significant difference in the changes of ghrelin between  the two groups ( Fbetween 
groups=4.913;p=0.012; Figure 1  below ) and the difference in baseline ghrelin levels was 
statistically significant (p=0.035) .  
 
Figure 1  
13 
  
Legend: a comparison of non -abstinent alcohol -dependent subjects (n = 13) and abstinent alcohol -dependent 
subjects (n = 19) indicated a significant difference in the changes of ghrelin between the two groups ( p=0.012) and 
a significant difference in baseline ghrelin levels (p=0.035).   
 
These findings suggest that baseline ghre lin levels play an important role in alcoholic  
individual s; those patients with higher ghrelin levels at T0 , in fact,  were those who relapsed 
during the 12 -week period. We also found a statistically significant positive correlation between 
ghrelin at basel ine (T0) and craving during the 12 -week period ( T1-3), measured by [CONTACT_288441] (PACS).  
 
Additional translational studies.  
Consistent with the preclinical and clinical data presented above and with our overall hypothesis 
that the ghrelin plays a key role in alcohol reward and consumption, Davis and colleagues133 at 
the University of Cincinnati analyzed self -report of ethanol intake in 6,165 bariatric patients 
before and following a Roux-en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_6476] (RYGB) surgery . Patients that reported 
frequent consumption of ethanol  before RYGB reported decreased consumption following 
RYGB surgery.  The same group also examined the hypothesis that RYGB surgery attenuates 
ethanol  intake and reward in the context of frequent ethanol  consumption  utiliz ing a rodent 
model of RYGB and examined ethanol  consumption and ethanol  reward in male ethanol -
preferring (P) rats . Interestingly, t he RYGB procedure decreased ethanol  intake and the 
reinforcing properties of ethanol  in P rats. Of special int erest for this protocol, pharmacologic 
replacement of the gut hormone ghrelin  restored drinking behavior in P rats following RYGB.  
 
Genetic polymorphisms of the ghrelin gene.  
In another study132, our group explored  two polymorphisms of the ghrelin  gene (i.e. G152A  
(Arg51Gln) and C214A (Leu72Met) ; these two polymorphisms were investigated previously in 
patients with binge eating disorders) in alcoholics and controls . Statistical comparisons of BMI 
values by [CONTACT_288442] -way ANOVA revealed a main effect of  
genotype (F = 7.013, P = 0.009) with  no main effect of  diagnosis (F = 0.705, P = 0.402) and a 
trend toward a s ignificant  diagnosis –genotype interaction (F = 0.096, P =  
0.0757).  Furthermore, Landgren and colleagues134 reported that SNP rs2232165 of the GHS -R1A 
gene was associated with heavy alcohol consumption and SNP rs2948694 of the same gene as 
well as haplotypes of both the pro -ghrelin and the GHS -R1A genes were associated with body 

[ADDRESS_351482] a 
possible role of the genes encoding ghrelin and/or its receptor in alcohol use, but these findings 
are not conclusive and suggest the need to further explore this aspect.  
 
Summary . 
In summary, human studies show: i) reduced ghrelin levels in actively drinking alcoholics; ii) 
increased ghrelin levels during alcohol abstinence; iii) a positive correlation between ghrelin 
level and alcohol craving scores. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_288389] -clinica l studies, the human studies 
suggest that ghrelin represents a potential new target for treatment of alcoholism . 
 
Additional clinical data: p reliminary findings  with IV Ghre lin in alcohol -dependent  individuals  
While at Brown University, [CONTACT_59890] received funding from NIAAA (AA019709 ) to conduct 
the first study ever administering IV human ghrelin to non-treatment seeking heavy drinking 
alcohol -dependent individuals. The study – clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] – was also reviewed 
by [CONTACT_1622] (IND#  109242 ; sponsor  and holder : [CONTACT_59890]). The experimental design is a 
between -subject 3-arm randomized double -blind placebo -controlled laboratory. Human ghrelin 
or saline solution (placebo) represent s the between subjects  factor. Each participant is  randomly 
assigned to receive IV  ghrelin 1 microg/kg or ghrelin 3 microg/kg or saline solution and then 
participate s in a cue-reactivity (CR) experiment. Cue reactivity has demonstrated utility in 
eliciting urge to drink in alco holics135-137. Exposure to alcohol cues (e.g.: the sight and smell of 
an individual’s preferred beverage), reliably elicits increased urge to drink alcohol, increased 
salivation, and increased attention to the cues135-137 when compared with control cues.  
The two main endpoints of the trial performed at Brown University were : (1) whether IV ghrelin , 
as compared to IV saline , dose -dependently results in increased CR responses to alcohol cues in 
terms of urge to drink ; and (2) whether IV ghrelin , as compared to IV saline , does not 
significantly increase frequency and intensity of Adverse Events (AEs).  
The main findings of this trial were:  
- Forty -five (n = 45)  non-treatment seeking alcohol -dependent heavy drinking individuals were  
randomized and re ceived administration of either IV ghrelin 1 microg/kg , IV ghrelin 3 
microg/kg  or placebo  (IV saline) . There were no serious adverse events (SAEs), unexpected 
AEs or severe AEs. There were only a few AEs, a ll were in the mild -moderate range and 
they were all expected. AEs were only transitory, and were all resolved without sequelae. It 
should be noted that the most common AE, i.e. increase in appetite, is in actuality a highly 
expected effect of ghrelin, give n that ghrelin physiologically increases appetite (indeed, 
current studies are investigating the therapeutic role of ghrelin to increase appetite, for 
example, in patients with cancer). The increase in appetite was only transitory and resolved 
quickly and without sequelae. Notably, although this study enrolled heavy drinkers, none of 
them reported flushing after the infusion IV of ghrelin . 
-  We found n o significant differences (p > 0.5) in the frequency AEs among the [ADDRESS_351483] -injection 
assessments [F(2,40) = 0.97, p = .39].  Due to the short half -life of ghrelin, we also ran a 
parallel ANCOVA on just t he first two post -injection assessments and this was also non -
signficant [F(2,40) = 1.37, p = .27].  
- Repeated measures ANCOVAs were conducted for the increase in alcohol urge during the 
CR procedure relative to the pre -medication urge level. Covariates inc luded age, weight, 
15 
 gender, and ethnicity/race. Pairwise comparisons revealed that alcohol urge was significantly 
greater for high dose ghrelin (3 mcg/kg) than for the placebo [p = .04, Least Significant 
Difference procedure (low vs. High dose: p = .19, placebo vs . Low dose: p = .52)] (Figure 2 ). 
The effect size (d) for the increase in alcohol urge for the high dose ghrelin versus placebo 
was 0.77 . Notably, while CR studies usually use water as a neutral cue, here we used juice as 
a non -alcoholic appetiti ve control cue, and we didn’t find a significant effect of ghrelin in 
increasing urge to juice, thus suggesting the specificity of ghrelin’s effects on urge to alcohol.

Summary of studies of ghrelin in alcoholism and questions that need to be answered.  
Both animal and human studies provide strong evidence that the ghrelin system influen ces not 
only hunger but also has  a clear role in the search for rewarding substances such as alcohol. 
Taken together, the preclinical studies provide strong evid ence that ghrelin works not only on 
homeostatic energy -regulatory centers (e.g., hypothalamus and hindbrain), thus increasing the 
research of food, but also on reward  centers (i.e ., mesolimbic DA pathways), thus playing a role 
on the reward value of substa nces, such as food and alcohol. As reported above, animal studies 
suggest that ghrelin activates the cholinergic -dopaminergic reward link and that ventral 
tegmental nAChRs have a central role for the DA -enhancing properties of ghrelin.  
Similarly, human stu dies have provided important information, showing that alcoholic 
individuals with higher plasma ghrelin levels have higher alcohol craving. These experiments 
suggest a model wherein elevated ghrelin levels might contribute to craving for substances such 
as alcohol. While the previous human studies have only tested plasma ghrelin levels, the study 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] conducted at Brown University (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288390]) represents a translational research 
investigating  the direct effect of exogenous ghrelin administration IV on alcohol -seeking 
behaviors . In addition to showing the safety of ghrelin administered IV to alcohol -dependent 
heavy drinkers , study [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] provides preliminary evidence that, as demonstrated in 
animal models, ghrelin may represent a novel pharmacolo gical target to treat alcoholism.  
While ghrelin antagonists are not available (but their development for other medical diseases is 
in progress), t here is a crucial need to provide additional human data using IV ghrelin

 administration  that can corroborate the animal studies performed to date  and can provide 
evidence that ghrelin plays an important role in alcohol -seeking behavior . While study 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] provides safety data and a preliminary evidence that ghrelin may increase acutely 
alcohol craving, a log ical next step of this research program is to test the effects of IV ghrelin 
administration on alcohol administration and on the behavioral effects of alcohol . Furthermore, it 
is important to investigate the CNS areas involved with alcohol reward via imagi ng tools. In the 
proposed study, we wish to provide direct, controlled clinical evidence that ghrelin is involved in 
the behavioral and central effects of alcohol administration. We propose to assess this using 1) a 
progressive ratio (PR) schedule paradigm  with IV alcohol infusion , a paradigm  that this research 
team has  already used and validated (as detailed next) , for example in protocol 08 -AA-0178 ; and 
then 2) an  “fMRI/alcohol clamp ” paradigm that this research  group has already validated and 
currently u sing, for example,  in a protocol assessing varenicline (08 -AA-0137).  
 
PR IV Alcohol Procedure  
The goal of the first paradigm is to investigate whether ghrelin alters alcohol’s pharmacologic 
effects, including motivation for alcohol reward, as well as subjective measures of craving, and 
the biphasic effects of alcohol. The progressive ratio (PR) schedule paradigm requires 
participants to press the button an increasing number of times for each subsequent alcohol 
exposure (for e.g., 10, 20, 40, 80, etc., button presses for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. infusions). 
Outcome measures of this paradigm are the “breakpoint”, i.e., the point at which the individual 
stops to work for more alcohol, as well as the average and peak BrACs achieved during the 
study. The PR schedule paradigm is an operant paradigm that is expected to assess motivation 
for reward (in this case, alcohol), and are based on the principle that people will work harder for 
greater rewards. There is much animal work to suggest the utility of oper ant paradigms in 
characterizing motivation for reward .[ADDRESS_351484] been used extensively in 
animal models and in a human studies to evaluate self -administration behavior for other drugs of 
abuse such as heroin and cocaine. Our research t eam at LCTS has experience using the PR 
paradigm , e.g. 08-AA-0178. The PR schedule paradigm represents an interesting and novel 
extension of the current development of IV alcohol self -administration methods  extensively used 
by [CONTACT_37152] (e.g.138,13 9).  Notably , since the alcohol administration is not oral, it avoids 
the cues associated with oral alcohol administration that can confound the interpretation of 
laboratory studies employing drinking paradigms.  Finally, during the PR sessions, the safety of 
ghrelin and alcohol, when co -administered IV  will be evaluated , therefore the PR sessions will 
assure the safety of alcohol and ghrelin co -administered b efore performing the second paradigm  
(“fMRI/alcohol clamp”)  with the same volunteers  (in fact, we will employ a within -subject 
design, as detailed after ).Our team has recently demonstrated  (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288391], Ph.D.; 
unpublished) the validity and utility of this procedure in a study whose primary o bjective was to 
examine alcohol intake behavior and the motivation for reward using subjective measures of 
alcohol effects and personality measures in a  PR schedule of IV alcohol self -administration in 28 
social drinkers.  In this study, w e estimated the correlations between sessions for number of 
button presses  (Fig. 3A) , total rewards earned  (Fig. 3B) , peak BrAC (Fig. 3C) , and average 
BrAC  (Fig. 3D) ; the correlation coefficients were high, demonstrating that this method has good 
test-retest reliability.

(3C), and average BrAC (3D).  
 
Furthermore, t otal ethanol self -administered during the PR schedule was significantly associated 
with drinking days  measured with the TimeLine Follow -Back (TLFB)  (Figure 4) , thus indicating 
the clinical relevance of this procedure  given its ability to reproduce in the human lab setting , the 
alcohol use in the naturalistic milieu.  
 
      Figure 4  
 
 Legend: significant association between total ethanol self -administered during the PR schedule  and drinking days . 
Additionally, in this study we also found that t otal ethanol self -administered during the whole PR 
schedule was significantly associated with the Drug Effects Questionnaire  (DEQ) score  
(considering its peak value) for measures of “wanting”  (Fig. 5A) , as well as with the DEQ score 
for “wanting” following the priming  (Fig. 5B) .

whole PR procedure (A) and following the priming (B).  
 
Additional interesting results of this study were that t otal ethanol self -administered during the PR 
schedule was significantly associated with DEQ scores for measures of “feeling” and “liking” 
drug effects , as well as “high” and “intoxication” were positively associated with number of 
button presses.  Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) maximum measures were significantly 
associated with total ethanol  and number of button presses. Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale 
sedation measure after priming was strongly associated with peak BrAc, average BrAC, and total 
rewards earned . 
In summary, these results demonstrat e that the PR IV alcohol infusion procedure has good test-
retest reliability  and demonstrate that th is method is sensitive to the rewarding and motivational 
properties of alcohol . 
 
fMRI/alcohol clamp  
The goal of the second paradigm is to investigate  possible mech anisms of action of ghrelin 
though the use of two slightly different but related fMRI procedures . Specifically:  
a) We will determine if ghrelin increases the incentive salience of alcohol predicting cues 
by [CONTACT_2329] a modified version of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task.  In this task 
subjects will button press to earn credits associated with subsequent alcohol 
admin istration, instead of monetary, reward.  The MID task has been used extensively in 
neuroeconomic imaging research and the difference in BOLD signal in the ventral 
striatum (VS) between anticipation of responding for $0 and anticipation of responding 
for $[ADDRESS_351485] (ROI ’s) for  this study 
are the  amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), as IV ghrelin has already shown 
its ability to activate these areas ,142 and all these areas play an important role in the neural 
systems model of alcoholism. 20,101,109,112 ,143 
b) In additio n to using fMRI to examine ghrelin’s effect on the incentive salience of alcohol 
cues, we will also use fMRI pr ocedures we have developed144 to examine the effect of 
ghrelin on the brain’s response to IV alcohol.  Our previous work has shown that IV 

19 
 alcohol administration using the “alcohol clamp” procedure (NIAAA protocol 04 -AA-
0060) results in a robust increase in BOLD signal in the human ventral striatum.  Thus, 
by [CONTACT_288443]’s reward 
circuitry.  
Our team has validated the procedures we propose here for the fMRI/clamp sessions. [CONTACT_288485] of the Section of Brain Electrophysiology and Imaging  has used and va lidated different 
versions of the MID task in the last decade and during the last years these procedures have been 
widely used in the functional neuroimaging imaging community to study reward processing. In 
the basic version of the task subjects see a cue indicating that on the current trial they are 
working for money (e.g., $5.00, $1.00, or $.20) or for no money; next they wait for a variable 
delay, and then press a button in response to presentation of a target. If they respond before the 
target disappear s, they win the money indicated at the start of the trial.  If they are too slow they 
win nothing. The interval between appearance of the initial cue and the target cue signaling the 
need to make a response is considered to manifest the brain state underly ing the motivation for 
the specific action and involves both elements of motor preparation as well as anticipation of 
gaining reward. Striatal activation during this interval can also be considered a measure of 
incentive salience.  Finally the subjects get  visual feedback indicating if they successfully 
responded,  how much they won or lost, and their total earnings. One of the major goals has been 
to develop ways of using a version of MID task to directly measure motivation to experience 
alcohol’s effects i n humans  and to use this model to study pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . In fact, [CONTACT_288486] of the Section on Human Psychopharmacology  is currently using this new 
approach in an experimental medicine study to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline for the 
reduction of excessive alcohol use in non -treatment seeking heavy drinkers. In this study, 
subjects are initially trained to button press to obtain intravenously administered ethanol. Then 
they are scanned while they  
perform a MID task during which they can button press to 
obtain points that determine how much intravenous alcohol or 
snack food they will be given at the conclusion of the scan. 
Thus, instead of measuring brain activation while anticipating 
working for mo ney, we can measure brain activation while 
anticipating  working for alcohol or food. Our group has 
recently conducted preliminary analysis (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288392], PhD; unpublished) of the data obtained from 
subjects on placebo (n=7); this analysis indicate d significantly 
higher BOLD activation in striatal regions during anticipation 
of working for alcohol reward under placebo conditions. 
Preliminary analysis of data from subjects receiving varenicline 
(n=8) compared to placebo (n=7) show lower   
Figure 6 : decreased BOLD 
activation in striatum (blue region)

BOLD activation in striatum during anticipation of working for alcohol (p<0.01, uncorrect ed, 
k>10) (Figure 6). These results suggest that the Alcohol -MID task can be used to measure 
motivation or desire for alcohol as well as the effect of a drug on this measure.  
 
Innovation of the study  
This protocol is not only a logical ‘next step’  of [CONTACT_59890]’s  NIAAA -funded study with ghrelin 
performed at Brown  University , but also there are several new and innovative aspects, i.e. 1) the 

20 
 study at Brown University  only assessed alcohol craving (i.e. alcohol was not administered), 
while this study will te st for the first time the role of IV ghrelin on alcohol administration. Using 
a model already validated by [CONTACT_2296] (the PR paradigm with IV alcohol administration ; 08-AA-
0178 ), this  protocol represents a direct translational study of the preclinical studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_288444] .3,4,117,121,[ADDRESS_351486] ; 2) this study will provide , 
for the first time , information on the effect of ghrelin on the brain’s response to  alcohol ; 3) the 
study at Brown University  only assessed the effects of a bolus on alcohol craving, while this 
protocol will assess the ef fects of ghrelin for a longer period of time. In fact, after a bolus of 
ghrelin, then an IV infusion of ghrelin will take place during the entire duration of the 
experiment; 4) there are only a few and preliminary data on the role of genetic polymorphisms of 
the ghreli n and ghrelin receptor genes  on alcohol consumption ; also,  none of the previous studies 
was conducted in subjects receiving an IV administration of ghrelin, thus this protocol will test 
genetic polymorphisms related to the ghrelin system in he avy drinkers receiving IV ghrelin; and 
5) although the well -known role of ghrelin in appetite and food intake, and while several data 
suggest that sweet preference may represent an important phenotype in alcoholic individuals, this 
protocol will explore  if and how sweet -liking status  (a sweet preference test will be performed, 
as detailed below)  may affect ghrelin levels and behavioral responses in heavy drinkers receiving 
IV ghrelin.  
In summary, this  project proposes to use validated approaches (i.e. IV al cohol infusion and 
fMRI) to provide a direct and objective evidence of the central role of ghrelin in alcohol reward 
and administration . The overall goal is to provide evidence of a novel neuropharmacological 
target to treat alcoholism, i.e. the ghrelin sy stem. If our h ypothesi s will be demonstrated, then 
this study will serve  as the platform to test ghrelin antagonists/inverse agonists as new 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_30260] . Additionally , this study may provide evidence of the use of 
IV ghrelin  as a ‘challenge /provocative  test’ for future behavioral and pharmacological studies.  
 
2. Study objectives  
The primary objective of this protocol is to investigate whether ghrelin alters alcohol’s 
pharmacologic effects, including motivation for alcohol rewar d, as well as subjective measures 
of craving, and the subjective response s to alcohol in heavy drinkers receiving IV 
administrations of ghrelin and alcohol.  
 
 
a. Primary objectives  
The primary measure of this study will be the breakpoint , which is the schedu le (number of 
button presses ) at which the individual stops to work for more alcohol.  
 
b. Secondary objectives  
Secondarily, the BrAC exposure measures  will also be determined , that is the highest  (max)  
BrAC, average BrAC and the area under the BrAC -time curve determined for each subject . Urge 
to drink  and alcohol sensitivity  will be measured during the PR session. Adverse events will also 
be assessed in order to assess the safety of the IV co -administra tion of ghrelin and alcohol.  Also, 
during the “ fMRI/alcohol clamp ” session, fMRI will be used to see whether ghrelin affects the 
activation of the ventral striatum  (VS)  in anticipation to work for alcohol reward  and the 
incentive salience of cues in subjec ts who will subsequently receive IV alcohol administration . In 
21 
 addition to the VS, other fMRI ROI ’s are the amygdala, insula and OFC. Adverse events will 
also be assessed during the fMRI/alcohol clamp sessions.  
Furthermore, an additional secondary aim will  be an explorat ory analysis of the role of genetic 
polymorphisms of  both ghrelin and ghrelin receptor gene s – detailed  in page  14 – as possible 
moderators of ghrelin’s effects on the primary aim  (‘breakpoint ’, i.e. number of button presses  in 
the IV alcohol PR procedure).  
 
3. Subjects : 
 a.  Descript ion of study populations  
Male and female a dults will be eligible to participate in this study.  Participants will be non -
treatment seeking heavy drinking volunteers. Our goal is to screen [ADDRESS_351487] s and recruit 62 
individuals. Assuming a 20% drop -out rate, we will reach 50 completers.  
 
b. Inclusion criteria  
1. Male and female participants between 21 -60 years of age.  
2. Good health as determined by [CONTACT_9870], physical exam, ECG and lab tests.

4. Study Design  and Methods : 
a. Study overview   
The study is designed as a within -subject, double -blind, placebo -controlled randomized clinical 
trial of ghrelin with non -treatment seeking heavy drinking volunteers. Including screening and 
follow -up evaluations, the study lasts about 8 weeks and will require  five visits to the NIH CRC. 
The five visits will be as follow and performed in a counter -balanced order across participants:  
Visit #1 - Initial screening visit  (under the NIAAA 98 -AA-0009 or 14 -AA-0181 
protocol ); 
Visit #2 - Alcohol PR + ghrelin/placebo;  
Visit #3 - Alcohol PR + placebo/ghrelin;  
Visit #4 - fMRI/alcohol clamp  + ghrelin/placebo;  
Visit #5 - fMRI/alcohol clamp  + placebo/ghrelin;  
23 
 Visit #[ADDRESS_351490]-study follow -up. 
 
b. Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited through referrals from the NIH Volunteer Office, and from the 
Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison (PRPL) Office as well as through R esearchMatch.org 
(facilitated through PRPL). ResearchMatch is a voluntary service that matches people i nterested 
in being research participants with researchers conducting a wide range of studies. 
ResearchMatch is currently used for other protocols of our Clinical Program at NIAAA, as well 
as for many other NIH protocols. ResearchMatch is a Clinical and Tra nslational Science Awards 
(CTSA) initiative funded by [CONTACT_288446], part of 
the National Institutes of Health.  
Furthermore, participants will also be recruited by [CONTACT_288447]. A dvertisement language will be used as flyers with tear off tabs, posted on the 
NIH campus, campuses of universities and colleges in the greater Washington DC area, as well 
as in billboards of public places and public transportation services in the greater Washington DC 
area. Advertisements will also be posted in electronic and printed local media, including 
newsletters, websites and local newspapers in the greater Washington DC area (for example, the 
‘Express’). Listserv ad will be used on craigslist.org, u nder the volunteers’  section, as well as in 
NIH and other local email distribution lists, that are moderated, and following approval from the 
managers of these lists. ‘ClinicalTrials.gov’ may also represent a source of recruitment.  
Finally, participants wi ll also be recruited via the NIAAA Screening Protocol (98 -AA-0009, PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_288395] , Ph.D. ), or [ADDRESS_351491] be evaluated over the phone. Qualified candidates will come to the NIH 
CRC for a screening visit  (Visit #1 ) during which they will be enrolled in the NIAAA screening 
protocol (98 -AA-0009  or 14-AA-0181 ). If a clinical procedure is repeated (e.g. blood/urine lab 
work, EKG) under the screening protocol, exclusion/inclusion criteria will be based on the most 
recent clinical values. The screening procedures covered under the NIAAA screening protocol 
include  (details of the procedures are in the 98-AA-0009  protocol  or 14-AA-0181  protocol ) (a) 
medical history, (b) drinking history, using the timeline followback method (TLFB), (c) family 
history of alcoholism, using the Family Tree Questionnaire, (d) Structured Cl inical Interview for 
DSM -IV (SCID) psychiatric diagnoses including alcohol or drug dependence, (e) physical 
examination, including ECG, (f) blood tests for routine blood chemistry, complete blood count 
(CBC), liver enzymes, hepatitis and HIV screen, (g) ur ine tests to screen for illicit drugs, (h) th e 
NEO -PI [INVESTIGATOR_288396], and (i) an Alcoh ol Flushing Questionnaire145-[ADDRESS_351492] a flushing response (including facial flushing, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
drowsiness and other unpleasa nt symptoms) whe n drinking alcoholic beverages. The visit may 
last up to [ADDRESS_351493] and then 
placebo (or vice versa) during the third and fourth sessions, namely the two “ fMRI/alcohol 
clamp ” sessions. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either ghrelin or  placebo 
during the study according to gender, based on a stratified block design. The Pharmaceutical 
Development Service (PDS) of the NIH CRC will develop the randomization schedule and 
maintain the blind; they will also be responsible for determining subject allocation. The 
allocation code will be kept in a safe  location  at the pharmacy, with access only for the 
responsible pharmacist. In emergency medical situations, which may require pr emature breaking 
of the code, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_288397]; 
this will then be documented, and reported to the IRB.    
 
d. Study Procedures  
Visits and procedures  
 
IV Ghrelin infusion: dose justification  
Overview.  
After a 10 minute bolus of IV ghrelin or matched placebo (saline solution) , IV ghrelin or placebo 
infusion  will last 120 min during visits #2 and #3  (120 minutes is the duration of the alcohol PR 
session ) and 65 min during visits #4 and #5  (the t otal duration of the fMRI/alcohol clamp  is 95 
min with 35min for the alcohol clamp  – details below and in appendix flow sheets ). The 
Pharmaceutical Development Service (PDS) of the NIH CRC will prepare the ghrelin bags ready 
for IV infusion. Vials of ghrelin and saline wil l be indistinguishable visually .  
 
Dose.  
A bolus of IV ghrelin followed by [CONTACT_288448], as detailed next.  
- An IV administration of 3 mcg/kg bolus of ghrelin. The injection of the bolus will start 10 
minut es before the start of the other lab procedures ( PR for Visits #2 and #3; “fMRI/alcohol 
clamp” for Visits #4 and #5) and will last 10 minutes;  
- An infusion of 5 pmol/ Kg/min (that is 1 6.9 ng/kg/min) o f ghrelin for 120 minutes (Visits #2 
and #3) or 65 minutes  (Visits #4 and #5). In fact,  the infusion will last for the duration of the 
PR (120 minutes at Visits #2 and #3) and for a portion  of the 95 min “fMRI/alcohol clamp” 
(65 minutes at at Visits #4 and #5).  
 
 
Dose justification.  
1. Ghrelin dose is adjusted per w eight. Although some studies used a fixed dose47, the 
majority of the studies used a dose of ghrelin adjusted per weight (see Tables 1 -2). 
Consistent with the majority of the literature, we will use a dose of ghrelin based on body 
weight. To now, there are  no published data showing that ghrelin dose should also be based 
on other parameters, such as body water and/or gender. However, it is worth noting th at 
25 
 two studies showed that IV ghrelin effects are independent of gender42,47. We will exclude 
subjects affected by [CONTACT_139447] (BMI ≥ 30 Kg/m2) or subject s with weight ≥ [ADDRESS_351494] three reasons: 1) to keep doses of ghrelin administered at a low -medium level, g iven 
we will adjust the dose per weight; 2) to avoid enrolling subjects with a possible ‘ghr elin 
resistance’ which may mask the effects of IV ghrelin administration; and  3) to avoid 
enrolling subjects with other psychiatric disorders (e.g. binge eating), as we want to focus 
specifically on the effects of ghrelin on alcohol  reward . 
2. Ghrelin is administered as a bolus followed by [CONTACT_288449]. In the previous study at Brown 
University, only a bolus of 1 mcg/kg or 3 mcg/kg was used because a longer exposure to 
ghrelin was not needed given the short duration of the human lab session (e.g.  the cue-
reactivity experiment  last ~30 minutes ). By [CONTACT_22242], in this protocol, it is important that 
ghrelin’s effects last longer in order to fully investigate the possible effects of ghrelin on 
alcohol reward, alcohol craving, alcohol sensitivity and fM RI outcomes during the entire 
duration of the human lab sessions perfor med at Visits #2 -5. W e will still employ an initial 
bolus, as the preliminary data from Brown University (see Figure 2) suggest that a bolus 
might acutely and temporarily increase alcoh ol craving. Specifically, we will use a bolus of 
3 mcg/kg because the preliminary data (see Figure 1  above ) might suggest a possible 
(albeit not significant - interim analysis) dose -response effect on alcohol craving, thus the 
higher dose should be used to  maximize the pr obability of finding a drug  effect.  After the 
10-minute ghrelin bolus, a n infusion of 5 pmol/Kg/min of ghrelin for 120 minutes (Visits 
#2 and #3) or 65 minutes (Visits #4 and #5) will take place. The dose of 5 pmol/Kg/min (= 
16.9 ng/kg/min)  is that most frequently used in previous studies with healthy controls or 
subjects with other chronic conditions, as detailed in the Tables 1 and 2. For example, 
Stephen Bloom’s lab at the Imperia l College of London has demonstrated that  5 
pmol/Kg/min (as  compared not only to placebo, but also to  1 pmol/Kg/min) is able to 
reproduce the physiological effects of gh relin. Although our dose schedule includes a bolus 
of 3 microg/Kg before the infusion of 5 pmol/Kg/min, it is important to note that other 
studies  have used even higher doses of ghrelin (e.g. higher total daily exposure) and still 
with a very safe profile. For example, Lavin et al.49 used an IV ghrelin dose of 10 
pmol/Kg/min for [ADDRESS_351495]. Anna 
Capp ola’s lab at UPenn has recently performed a 3 -hr IV ghrelin study69 where ghrelin was 
infused at a rate of 2.5pmol/kg/min for the first 60 minutes, 5 pmol/Kg/min for the second 
60 minutes, and 10 pmol/kg/min for the last [ADDRESS_351496] was 
a feeling of warmth. Notably, Cappola’s study was conducted in individuals who were 
generally more prone to develop side -effects, e.g. individuals > 70 years old with geriatric 
frailty  (while here we will exclude anyone > 60 -yr-old). In this s tudy, we propose a dose 
whose total daily exposure is significantly lower compared to the studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_288450]’s49 and Cappola’s lab69. 
 
PR sessions (visits #2 & #3)  
Breath  ethanol levels will be measured, a urine drug screen and, in women, a urine pregnancy 
test will be performed at the start of these sessions. I nformation regarding alcohol drinking, 
cigarette smoking, mood and anxiety states and symptoms will be collected. Food craving and 
urge to drink  alcohol will also be collected . 
Prior to the start of the session, two indwelling IV catheters are inserted using sterile technique. 
One of the IV catheters is used for the ethanol IV infusion, the other for the ghrelin IV infusion. 
[ADDRESS_351497] is seated in a comfortable chair, out of sight of the 
infusion pumps, and instructed in the procedures. The experimenter will be available to answer 
any questions raised by [CONTACT_288451]-being of the 
participant.  
 
Progressive Ratio Schedule Self -administration  (Visits #2 and #3) . 
The PR schedule self -administration will be conducted using the Computer -Assisted Self -
infusion of Ethanol (CASE) system (currently being used in two NIH protocols 08 -AA-0137 and 
08-AA-0178). Just prior to the start of the PR schedule session, the subject will be reminded of 
the procedure for obtaining alcohol during the session.  Following a 15-min priming interval  (that 
will not applied here, as our ‘priming’ is the IV bolus of ghrelin) , the PR period lasting 120 
minutes  begins.  Each standardized exposure will follow a slopelet pattern (linear increase of 7.5 
mg% over 2.5 min followed by a linear decrease of 0.5 mg%/min until the next exposure). The 
PR schedule will escalate geometrically from using a progressive ratio that will b e empi[INVESTIGATOR_288398]. An initial PR schedule will be established based on simulations using the model 
published by [CONTACT_288452] .[ADDRESS_351498] exposure  and escalates exponentially to requiring 
~15,[ADDRESS_351499] 6 subjects, the schedule may be adjusted before 
proceeding with the enrollment of other subjects . Within 0.5 seconds of pushing the drink button, 
the CASE system software will begin infusing the alcohol necessary to produce the de sired 
increase in BrAC exposure from the BrAC level at the time the button was pushed. Also, if the 
CASE system predicts that an additional drink selected by [CONTACT_288453] a peak 
BrAC 0.12 (which is the upper limit for BrACs achieved in t his study ), then the push button will 
be inactivated, with the subject’s knowledge, until the time when the predicted peak BrAC is 
below the upper limit.  
 
In an attempt to  control the ambient environment during the self -administration session, 
participants will be offered one of five choices of activity: 1) listening to music ; 2) watching 
videos of television comedy shows ; 3) watching videos of nature documentaries ; 4) watc hing 
sports videos ; or 5) browsing the internet on a laptop or tablet . The participant’s choice will be 
documented and any effect of the participant’s activity on self -administration measures will be 
explored. The experimenter will be available to answer a ny questions raised by [CONTACT_288454] -being of the participant. At 15-minute intervals , the 
experimenter will obtain a BrAC reading. Participants will be asked to complete a Drug Effects 
Questionnaire (DEQ) wh ich assesses feelings of “high” and “intoxication” and how much they 
“like” the feelings they perceive using visual analog scales ,148 and the Biphasic Alcohol Effects 
Scale (BAES)[ADDRESS_351500] of alcohol. Participants will  also 
complete the  Alcohol Visual Analogue Scale (A -VAS) , the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) 
to assess the urge to consume alcohol ,150 a mood questionnaire (Profile of Mood States, 
POMS151), and the CASE Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) to determine craving and if 
participant’s can gauge the amount of ethanol infused . At the end of the session, the infusion 
pump will be disconnected and the IV catheter s will be removed from the participant’s arm. 
Lunch will be provided and serial breathalyzer tests wi ll be done to track the BrAC level until it 
27 
 reaches 0.00%.  Then, participant will be asked to stay in the Clinical Center overnight and the 
morning after participant will have breakfast, receive debriefing and then released.  
 
Infusion profile computation u sing the CASE system: The infusion rate profile for each 
participant is calculated using CASE system software, which exercises a modification of the 
physiologically -based pharmacokinetic  model of ethanol distribution and elimination being used 
in completed  and ongoing LCTS alcohol infusion studies (03 -AA-0283, 04 -AA-0060 , 07-AA-
0026 , 08-AA-0125, 08 -AA-0137, 08 -AA-0178, 11 -AA-0180 ). Currently, physiologically -based 
pharmacokinetic  model parameters are computed for each individual participant by 
[CONTACT_288455] n of the subject’s age, height weight and gender into the physiologic parameters of 
the model.  Using a high gain on the simulated error between model and desired BrAC as the 
infused alcohol, the model is forced to follow the desired time course of BrAC, t hereby 
[CONTACT_288456] a continuous variable. A pump driver software 
provides the interface between the buffer and the infusion pumps, using the computer’s real -time 
system clock to administer the profile during the experi mental session.  Since the modeling 
solutions are calculated at a thousand -times real -time, the delay between the subject electing 
another drink and the consequent adjustment to the infusion profile is negligible. The software 
will manage adherence to the limits on availability of another drink by [CONTACT_288457] -set upper limit for BrAC exposure.  
 
Additional baseline assessments performed at Visit# [ADDRESS_351501] 
indicates that the hedonic response to sweet taste is associated with genetic risk of alcohol 
dependence (AD) in humans. Given that we are investigating a peptide that physiologically is 
involved with food reward and appetitive behaviors, it w ill be scientifically interesting to explore 
possible differences between sweet -liking  and sweet -disliking  individuals in this study.  
Sweet preference testing will be conducted as previously described (e.g.152.153). Each  subject will 
be instructed to sip, swish around his/her mouth and then spit out five different concentrations of 
a sweet solution (0.05, 0.10, 0.21, 0.42 and 0.83 M) each of which will be presented five times in 
a pseudorandom order for a total of 25 tastings. After each tasting, participan ts will rinse their 
mouths with distilled water before proceeding to the next solution. The participants then will rate 
the intensity and pleasurableness  of each tasting using a 200 mm analog scale. Subjects will be 
assigned to one of two categories — sweet -liking  or sweet -disliking —based upon their hedonic 
response to the various sucrose concentrations. To be categorized as a sweet liker, a subject must 
rate the highest concentration of sucrose (0.83 M) as the most pleasurable. Sweet -dislikers could 
prefer  any of the other four concentrations. Such categorization has been shown to be stable over 
time.  
 
Brief Addictive Behavior Social Density Assessment (BASDA) . We will administer the alcohol 
component of the abbreviated version of the  BASDA, as recently developed at the University of 
Georgia.154 The BASDA measures the perception of alcohol use for each participant’s 1st, 2nd, 
3rd, & 4th closest non -biological associates, mother, father, and two closest siblings in age , as 
self-reported  by [CONTACT_87755] . The BASDA alcohol use subscale consists of the first three 
questions of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The goal of this assessment 
[ADDRESS_351502] associates’ drinking 
behaviors. Participants are not asked to provide the names of their participants’ closest biological 
and non -biological associates.  
 
Alcohol effects questionnaire (AEFQ)  version s . The alcohol effects questionnaire is a revision of 
the alcohol expectancy questionnaire  and is used to assess the positive and negative effects 
people expect to experience from alcohol . The brief questionnaire consists of 40 true/false items 
with 8 subscales that aims to assess personal beliefs regarding the both the reinforcing and 
undesirab le effects of alcohol. The 8 subscales are: global positive, social and physical pleasure, 
sexual enhancement, power and aggression, social expressiveness, relaxation and tension 
reduction, cognitive and physical impairment, and careless unconcern . In rese arch studies, AEFQ 
expectancy scores have correlated with drinking problems, alcohol cue reactivity , and number of 
lever presses during IV  alcohol self -administration  (unpublished data  from  [CONTACT_288487]’s 
lab).   
 
Behavioral approach system (BAS)/behavi oral inhibition system (BIS) scale . The BIS/BAS scale 
was developed to measure individual differences in the sensitivity of the BIS and BAS .155 The 
scale is divided into 4 subscales: BAS Drive, BAS Fun Seeking, BAS Reward Responsiveness, 
and BIS. Much research suggests these systems play an important role in vulnerability to 
addiction. In fact, high BAS Fun Seeking scores have been shown to be as sociated with lifetime 
drug abuse/dependence ,[ADDRESS_351503] circuitry.  
 
Finally, although this pr otocol will not assess formally smoking -related outcomes, we are also 
aware of the high comorbidity between alcoholism and smoking. Therefore, at Visit 2 (as well as 
at Visits 3 , 4 and 5 ), we will assess b reath carbon monoxide  (BrCO) for possible between -group 
differences and possible post -hoc analyses.  
 
fMRI/alcohol clamp  sessions (visits #4 & #5)  
Breath ethanol levels will be measured, a urine drug screen and, in women, a urine pregnancy 
test will be performed at the start of these sessions. The two “fMRI/alcohol clamp” sessions will 
be identical (but the double -blind drug condition will be ghrelin  or placebo) and they will be 
scheduled at approximately the same time of the day with at least [ADDRESS_351504] 3 days will also be applied between visits #3 and #4. 
fMRI scanning in this protocol is an investigational procedure. The administration of alcohol is 
performed following the standardized alcohol clamp paradigm for which our research team at 
LCTS has conside rable experience (e.g. 03 -AA-0283, 04 -AA-0060, 07 -AA-0026, 08 -AA-0125 
and 11 -AA-0180). The fMRI procedures will be similar to those used in protocols 98 -AA-0056 
and 04 -AA-0060. Also, the combined “fMRI/alcohol clamp” procedures will be identical to 
those u sed in the current varenicline protocol (08 -AA-0137), therefore the research team has 
already experience in this combined paradigm. BrAC testing will be done immediately prior to 
29 
 the scan and subjects whose BrAC exceeds 0.000% will not be scanned. An IV ca theter will be 
inserted in each forearm; one of the IV catheters is used for the ethanol IV infusion, the other for 
the ghrelin IV infusion. The IV catheter includes a bidirectional valve that allows for both 
infusion (e.g. ethanol) and blood sampling duri ng the experiment.  
Imaging will take place in the NIH NMR center using one of the center’s  3T scanners. An initial 
structural scan will be collected on each subject for later co -registration of functional images. 
The structural scan will last less than 10  minutes. Functional scans will be acquired using a T2* -
EPI[INVESTIGATOR_288399] (BOLD) contrast. Visual 
stimuli will be projected onto an opaque screen at the foot of the imaging machine via a liquid 
crystal diod e projector. Subjects will be able to view the images via a mirror placed above their 
head in the scanner. Subjects will have an opportunity for a break between structural and 
functional imaging , and will remain in contact [CONTACT_288458]. The  functional scans , (see appendix flow  sheet for scan 
times) , will be acquired while the subjects are at rest and while they participate in a modified 
version of the MID task in which they will respond t o cues that indicate the opportunity to press 
a button to gain a reward. On some trials the reward will be points that can be exchanged for 
snack foods (subjects can choose items from a hamper containing candy bars, bags of chips and 
crackers  provided by t he Nutrition Department  of the NIH Clinical Center ) while on other trials 
the reward will be points that will determine how much intravenous alcohol a subject will be 
given during the “alcohol clamp” procedure which will immediately follow the modified MID  
task. In the previous IV ghrelin alcohol study at Brown, we included a palatable nonalcoholic 
beverage to investigate whether the effects of IV ghrelin occur across caloric appetitive beverage 
cues. For the same reasons, and consistent with the role of gh relin in controlling food intake, in 
this protocol, participants will be exposed to both alcoholic and food -related cues  in order to 
tease a part possible non -specific effects of ghrelin on appetitive behaviors vs. specific effects on 
alcohol -related behaviors.  
After completion of the baseline modified MID task , subjects  will receive the ghrelin/placebo 
bolus and followed by a continuous infusion as described above.  During ghrelin/placebo 
infusion subjects will repeat the MID task  and resting scans.  Next, alcohol infusion begins, 
which will be given as described in protocol 08-AA-0137 . Ethanol will be infused as a 6%  v/v 
solution in saline. The infusion rates will be based on a physiologically -based pharmacokinetic 
model for ethanol – the same model u sed to compute the infusion rates for the alcohol self-
administration  session s described above . Blood samples will be obtained during the clamp. The 
alcohol clamp method has been used successfully in several studies of the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacologi cal effects of ethanol in humans ,158-[ADDRESS_351505] resting scan s and repeat the MID task .  (See fMRI 
appendix  flow sheet for details).  At the end of the infusion, the catheters will be removed, lunch  
will be served and repeated BrACs will be performed until BrAC ret urns to 0.0 0 g%. 
 
Diet (visits #2 -5) 
The night before each session, participants are admitted to the Clinical Center and will  receive a 
standardized dinner . After overnight stay, p articipants will receive a fixed breakfast in the 
morning. These two courses will be standardized in agreement with the NIH CC Nutrition 
Service. Then, before starting the session, a fixed light snack is served (≈167 Kcal; 
approximately 62% carbohydrate, 13%  protein, 25% fat) to standardize food intake before IV 
30 
 ghrelin. The use of a standardized caloric food intake before the experiment: i) is a procedure 
used in human studies testing ghrelin i.v.35,37 ,75,; ii) is consistent with studies testing the role of 
ghrelin on alcohol reward in animals without food deprivation effect98,122; iii) avoids the 
presence of elevated baseline ghrelin levels (present in food deprivation conditions34,74,81,91), 
which may  be a confounding factor for our controlled experiment (exogenous ghrelin vs. saline 
solution); iv) does not represent a confounding factor for the ethanol administration, as it is 
infused IV and not orally; and v) it is consistent with our similar procedu re used in the IV ghrelin 
alcohol study at Brown University. Lunch  will be provided after the end of each session. Water 
will be permitted ad libitum , while other beverages (e.g. soda) will not be permitted.  
 
In order to standardize the appetitive/metabolic condition s of the study participants, we also plan 
the following:  
- Nutrition Department staff at the NIH Clinical Center will meet with the participants to 
perform a 24 -hour recall of everything the participa nt consumed prior to admissi on. 
Participants will also be instructed to eat as similarly as possible during the 24 hours prior to 
each of their visits #2 -5; capturing the 24 -hr recall will allow for checking compliance with 
this. (This is not meant to say that all participants have t o eat the same foods, just that 
participant ‘001’ should eat t he same things each time and participant ‘002’ should eat the 
same t hings each time, even though ‘001’ and ‘002’ will be eating different things.) . 
Information on food intake and related calorie  intake during the entire stay in our Unit at the 
Clinical Center  will be also recorded . 
- Participants will be given a choice of a few lunch  and breakfast options, but all options will 
be the same in kcal and macronutrient content.   Tentatively, e ach participant will receive the 
same meals for all the visits ( e.g., if participant ‘001’  pi[INVESTIGATOR_288400]  A for the first visit, s/he 
will get lunch  A for all her/his visits.) , although participants’ requests to change their choice 
among the given options may be satisfied.   
 
Blood Sampling:  
Furthermore, at admission at each visit (Visit #2 -5), we will also collect blood samples in order 
to control appetitive/metabolic indicators prior to the initiation of the dietary regimen.  
Specifically, during the  PR sessions and the  fMRI /alcohol clamp sessions , at baseline we will 
collect : 
*Blood Test Panel I : blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, GH, insulin, IGF -1, cortisol, 
ACTH, PRL, FSH, LH, testosterone total and free, T3 -free, T4 -free, TSH ; 
**Blood Test Panel II : GH, insulin, cortisol, PRL  and other feeding -related (or stress -related 
hormones) .  During ghrelin/placebo/ETOH infusions, Blood Test Panel II  will be repeated every 
30 minutes during the PR sessions and every 15 minutes during the fMRI/alcohol clamp 
sessi ons. In addition, BAC will be measured twice  while participants are in the scanner.  
 
The timepoints for blood collection in the flowsheets of this protocol represent the maximum 
number of blood sampling for this protocol. While our ideal goal is to collect  all of them, we 
appreciate that occasionally blood collection may be missed due to expected technical problems 
during the study procedures . Furthermore, if there are blood draw issues with both IV lines, we 
might also attempt to draw blood using regular o r butterfly needles .  
  
31 
 Samples will be stored for subsequent analyses of ghrelin levels and other appetitive hormones 
(and stress hormones), including (but not limited to) insulin, leptin and GLP -1. Some of these 
stored samples will be shipped in a fully de -identified form to AI Fatemeh Akhlaghi’s laboratory 
to be processed for a metabolic panel that includes appetitive and stress peptides like ghrelin, 
insulin, leptin, GLP -1 and others. No samples wi ll be shipped until MTA is fully executed 
between NIAAA and URI . Furthermore, additional metabolic indicators ( e.g. glucose, 
cholesterol, triglycerides , thyroid hormones ) will also be assessed  prior to the initiation of the 
dietary regimen.  
 
Overnight stay s (visits #2 -5) 
This study will enroll non -treatment seeking heavy drinking outpatient individuals. Nonetheless, 
two overnight stay s will take place in the Clinical Center (e.g. Metabolic Unit  or NIAAA -LCTS  
inpatient unit,  pending on availability ) per each  session : 
- The night  before each session, i.e. Visits #2 -5. Th is allows  for controlling for two i mportant 
factors in this study:  
i) Alcohol  consumption before  each session, which  includes  the IV administration of 
alcohol and ghrelin. In fact, while the baselin e BrAC allows for controlling a recent 
consumption of alcohol , the overnight staying allows for a much longer and thus 
more rigorous contr ol of alcohol consumption, thus standardizing alcohol 
consumption across all participants. Additionally, the overnight  stay before Visits #[ADDRESS_351506] if BrAC was > 0.08 ; 
ii) The night before each session, each participant will receive a standard  pre-fixed  
dinner . Given the key role of ghrelin in food intake and metabolism, the overnight 
stay allows for controlling carefully caloric intake during the night before the 
experiment, thus standardizing food intake across all participants.  
- The night following each sess ion. This overnight will permit additional monitoring for safety 
reasons . Specifically, after the session is complete and subjects have lunch , vital signs and 
general well -being will be assessed  approximately every 30 minutes until BrAC will zero 
out. A no n-standardized dinner will served in the evening. Finally, p articipants will be 
debriefed on the following morning before being sent home.  
 
e.  End of Participation  
Follow -up (visit #6)  (lasting 30 minutes). One week after the last fMRI/alcohol clamp  session  
(Visit #5) , subjects will return to the NIH CRC for clinical evaluation, including assessment for 
compliance with the previous recommendations to reduce alcohol consumption.  
At this visit they will be informed about the results of their clinical evaluatio n for alcohol use 
disorders. We will follow the clinical guidelines for treatment of alcohol use disorders as 
described in the NIAAA publication " Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_25190]: a clinician's guide ". 
These guidelines prescribe a "Brief Intervention" d uring which the patient is informed of the 
diagnosis and a clear recommendation to stop drinking alcohol is made. The possible use of 
medication to reduce alcohol use as well as possible participation in a self -help group will be 
discussed, and a follow -up appointment in the NIAAA outpatient clinic will be scheduled if 
desired . After the follow -up visit, subjects will be considered to have completed the protocol. 
[ADDRESS_351507]  
While all steps are always taken to ensure quality data from all participants, we may ask 
participants who generate unusable data (or if there is an equipment failure) on one of their 
experimental sessions to repeat that session.   This will have the effect of maximizing the 
risk/benefit ratio as it will prevent having to discard usable data from one session and will 
minimize the number of participants recruited overall to obtain sufficient data to m eet pow er 
requirements.   We may ask the participant to return at a later date or to stay an additional night 
on the clinic unit.  Subjects will receive additional compensation if experimental sessions are 
repeated ; compensation for this as needed research procedures may vary based on the 
inconvenience units and will be based on the NIDA/NIAAA recommendations .  
 
5. Storage of data and samples  
Data will be stored on an NIH data server, under the management of the ORIT, NIAAA. The 
existence and types of information contained in the data management system have been publicly 
reported as required by [CONTACT_288459].  
 
It should be mentioned that the timepoi nts for the data collection outlined in the flowsheets of 
this protocol represent the maximum number that will be collected. While our ideal goal is to 
collect all of them, we appreciate that occasionally questionnaires and other data collection may 
be mis sed (missing data) as in any clinical study, due to time constraints resulting from possible 
technical problems during the study procedures  (e.g., a problem with the IV line or with the 
computer used to administer questionnaires, etc .). 
 
Plasma and serum f or blood levels of ghrelin, GH and other feeding -related and stress -related 
hormones will be collected from each subject on repeated occasions, as detailed in the study flow  
sheet s. Blood not processed via the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the Clini cal Center or 
will be in -80 freezers. All biological  specimens obtained under this protocol will be stored in 
coded form (protocol plus subject number) in freezers located in the access -controlled laboratory 
area of LCTS.  
 
Additional blood samples will be  collected for DNA extraction and future genetic analysis under 
the NIAAA Screening Protocol (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288395] , Ph.D. Genetic analyses include loci 
encoding pro -ghrelin  (GHRL) and its receptor (GHSR).  
 
6. Additional Considerations  
The present protocol will be submitted for revi ew to the FDA. [CONTACT_70004]  holds an IND for the 
use of IV ghrelin in alcohol -dependent heavy drinkers for the trial performed at Brown 
University . The FDA submission for this protocol will cross -reference the previous IND 
(notably, we will use ghrelin from the same lot#). Furthermore, [CONTACT_288487] holds an IND 
for the use of IV ethanol , which will be cross -referenced as well . 
 
[ADDRESS_351508] not 
been frequent, and when side -effects were reported, they were all in the mild range  (see Tables 1 
and 2 above) . No clinically significant, serious or unexpected side -effects have ever been reported 
in the published l iterature to data . It should also be noted that the previous study conducted at 
Brown by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leggio shows a very safe profile of IV ghrelin when administered to non -treatment 
seeking heavy drinking alcohol -dependent volunteers.  
Risks will be minimized thro ugh careful and detailed screening of participants to minimize 
recruitment of those who might be at higher risk for adverse events, as well as careful and detailed 
monitoring of adverse events and participant well -being during the laboratory sessions.  
1. Consistent with the well -known effect of ghrelin on food intake, h unger and craving for 
food may occur after IV ghrelin administration.  
2. IV Ghrelin has been associated with flushing, facial warmth and sweating. This side -effect, 
however, was never reported in the IV ghrelin study with alcoholic individuals at Brown 
University, and in that study history of flushing (e.g. alcohol -induced flushing reactions) 
was not an exclusion criterion . Nonetheless, in this study involving the IV administration s 
of ghrelin and alcoh ol, potential individuals with current  or prior history of alcohol -induced 
flushing reactions will be excluded.  
3. IV Ghrelin has been associated with d ecreased arterial pressure and secondary increased 
heart rate can also occur. In this study, we will exclude individuals with h istory of 
hypotension clinically significant (e.g.: history of fainting and/or syncopal attacks)  as well 
as those with resting systolic BP < 100mg . 
4. Rarely, elevated mood, abdominal discomfort, somnolence, fever, dia rrhoea, mild 
glucosuria, vertigo and emesis have been reported in individuals receiving IV ghrelin. 
Patients with chronic intestinal diseases and/or medical history of diarrhoea and metabolic 
disorders, including diabetes and obesity will be excluded.  Furthermore, in order to 
maximize safety, blood panels will include assessments of several metabolic hormones in 
order to monitor ghrelin’s effects on their levels.  
5. There are no enough data on the exposure of elder individuals to IV ghrelin. Specifically, 
amon g all of the studies testing IV ghrelin in humans (Tables 1 -2), only one study69 
included individuals > 70 years. Therefore, consistent with the majority of the published 
literature, participants > 70 years old will be excluded in the present study  (i.e. we will not 
enroll individuals who are > 60). 
6. Beyond the risks already described when ghrelin was  either infused or injected , we are 
aware that consistent with the main hypothesis of this study, IV ghrelin may, at least 
temporarily, increase alcohol  craving (a symptom provocation study). Therefore, this study 
includes a post-session debriefing  after each of the four sessions. The Investigators have 
all experience in the management of this population, including non -treatment seek ers 
taking part in alcohol laboratory studies. In particular, all NIAAA LCTS Investigators of 
this protocol have experience with challenge experiments (for example, alcohol, meta -
34 
 chlorophenylpi[INVESTIGATOR_3746], yohimbine, lipopolysaccharide ) that have been used previously or 
currently in patients with addictive disorders within the NIAAA intramural program, and 
no serious adverse events have been encountered in those studies.  Notably, unlike other 
compounds used for challenge studies, ghrelin is a naturally occurring hormone . 
Importantl y, since the brief half -life of IV ghrelin, we do not expect that the effects of the 
peptide on craving will be too long  once the IV administration is over . Safety is maximized 
by [CONTACT_288460] . This will allow for continued monitoring as needed, and th e morning after the 
session, subjects will be debriefed on their drinking and receive counseling, using 
motivational enhancement techniques, aimed at enhancing their readiness f or behavioral 
change and seeking treatment if needed, as recommended by [CONTACT_288461].[ADDRESS_351509] symptoms they might be experiencing. Recommendat ions to reduce or 
stop drinking again will be given to them prior to discharge.  We also note that s ubjects will 
receive a meal right after each session, and it is demonstrated that food suppresses plasma 
ghrelin levels.   
It should be also noted that we are  applying a conservative approach, e.g. we will keep participants 
overnight at the NIH Clinical Center after each alcohol/ghrelin infusion. [CONTACT_59890]’s study at 
Brown was an outpatient study and, there was no need to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288401] 
(although included in the protocol as a pos sible additional safety action). No serious adverse events 
(SAEs) occurred during the ghrelin study at Brown University. All debriefing sessions were 
conducted successfully, e.g. all participants were released after  A-VAS craving score was equal or 
lower to the baseline (pre -infusion IV ghrelin) A-VAS craving. There were no cases of persistent 
high craving at the end of the session.  
 
It is unknown if administration of ghrelin to pregnant women might cause harm to the fetus. No 
fetus will be exposed to exogenous ghrelin. A urine pregnancy test will be administered during 
each study visit block  to all women . A positive test for beta -hCG would exclude participation in 
the study. Should a positive test occur, the investigators will be informed, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_288402], and will offer referral 
to an obstetrician.  
 
IV alcohol administration  
    There is a potential risk of side -effects from infusion of alcohol. Ethanol is primarily a 
depressant of the Central Nervous System. Its effects, in general, are proportional to the BrAC 
reached after alcohol administration. Alc ohol may produce motor in -coordination, deficits in 
concentration, memory impairment and a feeling of expansiveness or euphoria, possibly 
followed by [CONTACT_288462][INVESTIGATOR_008]. Nausea and vomiting could rarely occur.  
1. The maximum BrAC s that may  be achieved during the IV alcohol PR sessions  will be  
0.12, while during the fMRI/alcohol clamp sessions the max will be 0.08 . This research 
team has reached th ese level s in previous/ongoing studies, and no subject has reported 
nausea,  experienced vomiting  or other clinically important side -effects . 
2. The alcohol infusion procedure is considered to be relatively safe: the concentration of 
alcohol in the infusate is never greater than 6% v/v and the limit on the amount of alcohol 
that can be infused is determi ned by [CONTACT_288463] 1000 ml capacity bags of the 
infusate (6% v/v alcohol ~ [ADDRESS_351510]).  
[ADDRESS_351511] several years of experience in s tudies administering intravenous alcohol to human 
participants without any major adverse events, and the nursing staff is well experienced 
in managing intoxicated participants.  
5. The procedures are consistent with the " Recommended Guidelines on Ethyl Alcoho l 
Administration in Human Experimentation " prepared by [CONTACT_152707], Dept. of Health and Human Services.  
 
Administration of alcohol to pregnant women might cause harm to the fetus.  No fetus will be 
exposed to ethanol. A urine pregnancy test will be administered during each study visit block  to 
all women .  A positive test for beta -hCG would exclude participation in the study. Should a 
positive test occur, the investigators will be informed, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_288403], and will offer referral to an obstetrician.  
 
IV Ghrelin and IV alcohol co -administration  
There is a potential risk for additive effects of ghrelin and alcohol co-administered, such as : 
- Flushing and facial warmth ; thus, we will exclude individuals with current or prior history of 
alcohol -induced flushing reactions . 
- Sedation ; thus, we will exclude subjects who take medications that may amplify alcohol’s 
sedative e ffects  and we will only enroll individuals who are not older than 60 . 
- Decreased arterial pressure ; thus, we will exclude individuals with h istory of hypotension 
clinically significant, and blood pressure  and continuous heart rate  will be monitore d during 
the lab and fMRI sessions.  Furthermore, subjects whose screening will show resting systolic 
BP < 100 mmHg are not enrolled in this study.  
As shown in Tables 1 and 2 above, the IV administration of ghrelin has a very safe profile, and 
we anticipate t hat its administration together with alcohol administration will be safe and well -
tolerated. Also, subjects will be continuously monitored during the lab sessions and alcohol 
and ghrelin administrations will be stopped (and the IRB notified) if a subject s hould develop 
any significant symptoms requiring to do so.  Not only the sessions are performed in a well -
controlled environment in the NIH Clinical Center , but subjects will be kept overnight at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288404].  
 
Risk of fMRI  
1. Anxiety about enclosed spaces - Some individuals experience claustrophobia when placed 
inside the magnet bore of the scanner. Participants will be warned about this in advance and 
advised not to participat e if they are prone to experiencing anxiety in enclosed places.   
2.  Nerve stimulation - The use of a 3T field strength magnet sometimes induces “peripheral 
nerve stimulation,” in which peripheral muscles twitch in association with scanning. Subjects 
will be notified of this possibility in the consent form. The twitching does not occur in 
everyone, is not painful, and usually lasts for a short time. Some individuals may find this 
mildly annoying and we will terminate the scanning if they feel uncomfortable. Fi nally, 
36 
 fMRI is a noisy process, so we require participants to wear foam earplugs while inside the 
scanner.  
 
Insertion of IV lines  
The total amount of blood to be drawn for this protocol will be approximately 428cc (=   87 US 
teaspoons ). There is a slight risk of bruising or, rarely, infection from insertion of indwelling 
peripheral venous catheters for infusion and blood sampling. Risks from IV catheterization are 
minimized by [CONTACT_288464]. Participants will be seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_288405].  
 
8. Subject Safety monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored regularly and frequently during their participation in the study. They 
will undergo standard assessment battery (described below) at each study visit.  
 
Parameters to be monitored (see Study flow sheet for times of monitoring individual items) : 
1. Weight  
2. Vital signs  
3. Continuous heart rate monitoring will be recorded during IV Ghrel in and IV alcohol co -
administration.  
4. BrAC, breath carbon monoxide (BrCO) ; Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) when 
participants are in the fMRI  scanner . 
5. Drug use: Urine Drug Test (UDT)  
6. Bloo d Test Panel  I: blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, GH, insulin , IGF -1, cortisol, 
ACTH, PRL, FSH, LH, testosterone total and free, T3 -free, T4 -free, TSH.  
Blood Test Panel II: GH, insulin, cortisol, PRL  (and other feeding and stress related 
hormones) . 
7. Urinalysis  
8. Pregnancy: urine pregnancy testing  
9. Mood and anxiety  level and suicidality (Comprehensive Psychopathology Rating Scale – 
CPRS ), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  
10. Alcohol consumption - TLFB and alcohol craving ( A-VAS  and AUQ ) 
11. NMR Safety Questionnaire - questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_288465] (to be completed at screening and visits 4 and 5).  
 
Toxicity tables/criteria to be used  
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 3.[ADDRESS_351512] withdrawal  
- A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  that is judged by [CONTACT_288466] ; 
- Pregnancy ; 
- At the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI) based on adverse event (AE) severity ; 
- Non-compliance wi th protocol procedures or investigator request(s) ; 
- Patient request . 
37 
  
Enrolled subjects who show up with p ositive UDT  or BrAC ≥ 0.08%  at one of the four 
experimental sessions  (excluding the night before visits 2 -5) will not  perform the session. In this 
case, the experimental session may be re -scheduled at the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106] . Additionally, a session 
may be rescheduled for other medical reasons for which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or MAI think it is in the best 
interest of the participant to re -schedule the session. However, i f the subject will repeatedly show 
up with positive UDT or BrAC  ≥ 0.08%  at repeated visits , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_288406]/her from 
the study.  
 
9. Outcome measures  
a. Primary outcome measures  
The primary measure of this study will be the breakpoint, which is the sched ule (number of 
button presses) at which the individual stops to work for more alcohol  during the PR sessions . 
 
b. Secondary outcome measures  
Alcohol exposure will be measured via BrAC exposure measures , i.e. highest BrAC, average 
BrAC and the area under the BrAC -time curve  and by [CONTACT_288467] . Alcohol craving will be measured using the Alcohol Visual Analogue Scale (A -VAS)  
and the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) . Sensitivity to alcohol will be measured using the 
Drug Effects Ques tionnaire (DEQ), Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale  (BAES ), and the Profile of 
Mood States (POMS), repeatedly during the PR session  and the CASE Experience Questionnaire  
(CEQ)                                                                                                                                                                                 
at the end of all sessions . fMRI BOLD signal in brain areas associated with incentive salience 
and areas associated with reward circuitry (including the ventral str iatum) will be measured 
during the “fMRI/alcohol clamp ” session.  
 
10. Statistical Analysis  
1. Analysis of data/ study outcomes  
Analysis of data/study outcomes  
    Outcome data will be examined for homogeneity of variance, and if necessary transformed to 
meet this criterion. Most of the analyses will consist of repeated measures ANCOVAs to 
accommodate dependent measures assessed at multiple time points. When the dependent 
measure is just asse ssed once then a regular ANCOVA will be used. We will examine 
medication main effects across several different dependent measures.  
 
Criteria for significance  
    A probability level of 0.[ADDRESS_351513] size of Cohen’s f 
≥ 0.4 (large effect size) with a sample size of 50 yields a power estimate ≥ 0.80 at alpha=0.05. 
The relative effect size c hosen (“large” effect size) for the power calculation is based on the 
observation that laboratory studies typi[INVESTIGATOR_288407] , 
including, for example, our recent (unpublished; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288408]) human lab studies using th e 
38 
 IV Alcohol PR procedure , described above and representing the study our primary aim (number 
of button presses) is based upon.  
Furthermore, the sample proposed here provides sufficient power  (power estimate ≥ 0.80 at 
alpha=0.05 ) to detect ghrelin’s effec ts on fMRI BOLD activation in the VS, consistent with the 
unpublished data (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288408] ; data already mentioned above ) with varenicline (n = 8) vs. 
placebo (n = 7) indicating significantly higher BOLD activation in  the varenicline group.  
Accrual number request, taking into account screening/ dropouts  
In the Brown University study with IV ghrelin, inclusionary/exclusionary criteria were similar 
and about 50% of the subjects screened were eligible and randomized. Consistent with other 
human laboratory studies  with a similar study length , we also expect that a number up to 20% 
will not complete the study. Therefore, we anticipate a number -needed -to-screen of [ADDRESS_351514] 
will be withdrawn from the study. W omen of child -bearing potential (i.e. who are pregnant or 
who are trying to become pregnant)  will not be included, because it is inappropriate a nd 
unethical to give alcohol to women who are pregnant because of the r isk of fetal alcohol 
syndrome. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active and have not been 
surgically sterilized must agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study  (details 
above in section 3b, Inclusion criteria, #4) . Furthermore, a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed at each session.  
 
d. Justification of sensitive procedures  
This study employs the use of placebo to evaluate the effects of ghrelin. This is the required 
standard set by [CONTACT_288468]. The previous outpatient human laboratory study 
conducted at Brown University was a placebo -controlled study and FDA reviewed its protocol.  
 
The hypothesis of this protocol is that IV ghrelin will temporarily increase the likehood  that 
participants will self -administer alcohol  during the PR session and will increase c raving. The 
possible temporary increase in alcohol administration and craving is a necessary challenge to 
evalu ate the ghrelin system as a novel neuropharmacological target for alcoholism. It should be 
noted that at this stage ghrelin administration cannot be considered a standard provocative test. 
Although very preliminary data from the Brown study suggest so, this  is a very early stage 
research. The possibility that IV ghrelin increases temporarily alcohol administration and craving 
is in fact the main objective measure of this project. The study at Brown was an outpatient study 
39 
 and its safety profile was excellent . This protocol will enroll outpatients who, however, will stay 
overnight at the NIH Clinical Center before and after each session (two nights per session).  
 
e. Safeguards for vulnerable populations  
Vulnerable populations will not be studied. Urine pregnancy tests will ensure that alcohol is not 
administered to women who may be pregnant.

12. Anticipated Benefit  
This study does not offer direct benefit to participants but is likely to yield generalizable 
knowledge about  the possible role of ghrelin in alcohol -related behaviors (e.g. drinking, craving, 
41 
 sensitivity). This will markedly facilitate the identification of a novel neuropharmacological 
target, thus facilitating the development of novel alcoholism treatments.  
 
13. Classification of ris k 
Overall risk and discomfort in this study is “more than minimal”. The increase over minimal 
risk, discomfort is minor, and every precaution and protection to minimize any risks will be 
taken as described in a previous se ction. This level is justified, because it will markedly facilitate 
medication development for alcoholism, and thus contribute to addressing major unmet medical 
needs. As such, the benefit:risk ratio of the proposed study is favorable.  
 
14. Consent documents a nd process  
a. Designation of those obtaining consent  
Study investigators designated as able to obtain consent in section ‘11f’ above, will obtain 
informed consent  for this protocol . 
 
b. Consent procedures  
At Visit 1 (Screening), subjects are screened throughout  the NIAAA Screening protocol 98-AA-
0009  (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_288395] , Ph.D. ) or 14-AA-0181  after consenting participants with an already 
IRB-approved consent form, specific for the 98 -AA-0009 or 14 -AA-0181 protocol.  
Eligible subjects are scheduled for Visit 2; the study -specific consent form for ghrelin  is obtained 
at Visit 2 before starting the other procedures outlined for Visit 2. Nonetheless, at Visit 1, if all 
information necessary to determine eligibility is obt ained and the participant is still in our Clinic, 
then the ghrelin -specific consent form can be obtained at the end of Visit 1 (although we predict 
this will be not a frequent scenario). In summary, the ghrelin -specific consent form will be 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_288413] 2, and occasionally at the end of the Visit 1. Participants who might be 
eligible at the end of Visit 1 (but we will make clear that their eligib ility will have to be 
confirmed ) will be allowed to take the consent document home before Visit [ADDRESS_351518] the opti on to read the consent home, call us with questions, and 
consult (if they want) family members and/or their private health care professional. The ghrelin -
specific consent form will be obtained befo re starting the procedures scheduled for Visit 2, and 
all procedures of Visit [ADDRESS_351519] upon arri val (covered generally under the standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288414]). If the results is >0.03, then the subject is informed that we cannot proceed, and they 
are given the op tion of waiting until their level falls below 0.02 and/or sending them back in a 
cab. If the reading is >0.08, we strongly encourage them to stay at least until they drop below the 
legal limit (and if participants came by [CONTACT_288471]’t want to wait until <  0.08, then the NIH 
police is notified, as already specified in the consent). If the readi ng is ≤0.03, we let the subject  
know that we will need to wait [ADDRESS_351520] [ i.e.: a) ask to the participant whether or not they have 
been consented; and b) verify consent was signed ] before study procedures take place at the time 
of the admission (Visit 1). As part of the consent procedure, participants’ ability to understand the 
consent will be evalu ated using the ‘ NIDA/NIAAA Evaluation of Potential Research 
Participants’ Ability to Consent ’. 
 
 
c. Consent documents  
The consent form attached in the Appendix contains all required elements . The original consent 
is filed with their NIH medical record and a digital copy is uploaded into the CRIS system. A 
copy of the signed consent is also made for the subject's CRF binder for regulatory purposes.  
 
Data and Safety monitoring  
d. Data and Safety monitor  
Data and safety monitoring commensurate with the degree of risk involved in participation in a 
small, single -site trial like the present one  and will be performed by [CONTACT_288472] (ISM).  
 
e. Data and safety monitoring plan  
The ISM is a physician with relevant  expertise, whose primary responsibility is to provide 
independent safety monitoring in a timely fashion. To ensure expertise in clinical addiction 
research as well as independence, the ISM for the current study will be a physician from a 
different Section  of NIAAA. The ISM responsibilities will be assumed by [CONTACT_288473], 
M.D., NIAAA or Falk Lohoff, M.D. NIAAA.  
The ISM evaluation includes the progress of the research study as documented in the “ISM 
Monitoring Report and Log”, data quality from review  of adverse events, lab data and relevant 
clinical data collected immediately after they occur or are reported, with follow -up through 
resolution, and participant accrual in the Screening and Enrollment Log. The ISM reviews on an 
ongoing basis individual a nd cumulative participant data, and makes recommendations regarding 
the safe continuation of the study, or its termination. The ISM may break the study blind if 
needed. Weekly safety data monitoring reports are generated by [CONTACT_288474], ISM and PI [INVESTIGATOR_288415]. Appropriate action is 
then conveyed to the research team.  
The ISM will submit their review findings on the “Independent Safety Monitoring Report and 
Log” (stored in regulatory binder) for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_288416].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_288417]/or in the case of a PR report the timing of 
which is in compliance with OHSRP guidelines.  
Adverse Event reporting and/or Problem Reporting  will be performed consistent with current 
OHSRP and NIH SOP Guidelines including; report submission in PTMS for OCD and IRB 
review, email notification to the study sponsor if this is a separate individual from the PI, hard 
copy notification in triplicate via Fed Ex/U.S. Mail to the FDA.

Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_288418] 
(SAEs) related to the study drug [> 5 SAEs].  
There is  no plan at this stage to conduct an interim analysis.  
f. Criteria for suspending study procedures on an individual basis:  Administration of 
study medication or alcohol will be suspended on a case - by-case basis as per the PI [INVESTIGATOR_288419]:  
o Clinically significant findings including changes in mood or behavior such as 
aggression, agitation, depression or suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior.  
o Changes in concomitant medications that may interact with study medication or 
alcohol.  
o At the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI) and Medical Investigator, based 
on adverse event (AE) severity  
o Non-compliance with protocol procedures or investigator request(s)  
o Patient request  
o Equipment failure

Safety monitoring  
 
 
 
15.   Clinical Monitoring/ Quality Assurance  
Quality assurance will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_288420]/NIAAA/NIDA Combined Monitoring Plan, Intramura l Research Program  
Auditing Committ ee (IRPAC) (Please see Appendix ( E) – Standard Operating 
Procedures for the Intramural NIMH, NIAAA and NIDA Combined Monitoring Plan)  
coordinated by [CONTACT_288475] s of the Clinical Dire ctor at NIMH,NIAAA and NIDA.  
The NIMH/NIAAA/NIDA Combined Monitoring Plan, Intramural Research Program 
Auditing Committee (IRPAC)  monitors intramural research studies to ensure 
compliance with GCP, organizational policies and applicable federal, state and local 
laws and the reliability of  study data.    
 
a. Quality assurance monitor  
 Quality assurance (QA) will be performed by [CONTACT_978], as well as by [CONTACT_288476], which according to established practice is 
considered sufficient for small, single -site trials, like the present project . 
The QA monitor for this study will have considerable expertise in clinical 
trials in alcohol dependence, and will have completed training in Clinical 
Research Monitoring and GCP Compliance.  
 
 
44 
 b. Quality assurance plan  
 All participants’ data and binders  will be r eview ed on a monthly  basis.  
 
16. Adverse event  and unanticipated problem  reporting  
 
Adverse events, protocol deviations, unanticipated problems (UP), Unanticipated Adverse 
Device Effects (UADEs), serious adverse events are defined as described in NIH  HRPP SOP 16 
(“Reporting Requirements for Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events and Protocol 
Deviations.”).   The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_28874], documenting, and 
reporting unanticipated problems, adverse events (AEs), including serio us adverse events 
(SAEs), and deviations in accordance with NIH policy, IRB requirements, and federal 
regulations. Relatedness to the research of all serious adverse events will be determined by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_214597].  
 Serious unanticipated pr oblems and serious protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB and 
CD as soon as possible and in writing on the Problem Report Form not more than [ADDRESS_351521] therapy for heavy drinking 
and will not be allowed to participate in this study.  
 
18.  Confid entiality  
This protocol is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality  (CoC)  issued by [CONTACT_288477].   Strict subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout the 
study.  Confidentiality and information technology stand ards are in place at the NIAAA/LCTS 
intramural program to protect electronic repositories of patient data as well as other clinical 
patient related material. It is reasonably expected that these safeguards will protect participants' 
medical and personal he alth information, ensuring their privacy.    
Information obtained in the course of being screened for or participating in this protocol will 
become part of the patient's NIH medical record. This includes potentially sensitive information, 
such as urine test s positive for illicit drugs. Access to this information may be requested by [CONTACT_288478]. Such access will not be granted without the explicit, written consent of the subjects.  
Samples and data will be stored using codes that we assign.  Data will be ke pt in password 
protected computers.  Samples will be kept in locked storage.  Only study personnel  will have 
access to the samples and data.  
 
20. Conflict of Interest  
a.   Distribution of NIH Guidelines  
[ADDRESS_351522] to transfer t o agencies outside the US Government.  
 
22. Compensation

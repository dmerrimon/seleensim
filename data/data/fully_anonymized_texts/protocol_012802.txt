STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample Size Calculation
1. Primary analysis: Test equivalence of M923 compared with EU RPP using the PASI75 response
rate at 16 weeks, 
2.
3. 516 subjects randomized (258 in Arm A and 258 in Arm B)
Equivalence Margin Justification:
The treatment effect versus placebo, based on PASI75 at 16 weeks from a Phase 3 study (REVEAL  1), was
estimated to be 0.647 (lower bound of 2-sided 95% confidence interval 0.460).
The treatment effect versus placebo, based on PASI75 at 16 weeks from the other pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study 
(CHAMPI[INVESTIGATOR_45372]  2), was estimated to be 0.64 (lower bound of 2-sided 95% confidence interval 0.597).
Margin for US: 
An 18% equivalence margin was selected based on observed variation in response rates in adalimumab’s Phase 2  
3vs Phase 3 studies at 12 weeks, and on the statistical (M1) margins in the Phase 3 studies at 
16 weeks. Based on the meta-analysis of the REVEAL  1and CHAMPI[INVESTIGATOR_45372]  2studies, the 95% confidence 
bound for the difference in proportions of PASI75 is 0.5975 to 0.6744.  The acceptable margins (M1) statistically from the Phase 3 studies were 0.298 at 16 weeks. The proposed margin of 18% preserves 70% of the treatment effect, and is well within both the inter-trial variation in response rates and the M1 from Phase 3 and comprises a conservative margin for assessment of equivalence.

Margin for EU: 
A 15% equivalence m argin was selected based on observed variation in response rates in adalimumab’s 
Phase 2 3vs Phase 3 studies at 12 w eeks, and on the statistical (M1) margins in the Phase 3 studies 
at16weeks. Based on the meta -analysis of the REVEAL 1and CHAMPI[INVESTIGATOR_45372] 2studies, the 95% confidence 
bound for the difference in proportions of P ASI75 is 0.5975 to 0.6744.  The acceptable margins (M1) 
statistically from the Phase 3 studies were 0.298 at 16 weeks. The proposed margin of 15% preserves 
75% of the treatment effect, and is well within both the inter -trial variation in response rates and the M1 
from Phase 3 and comprises a conservative margin for assessment of equivalence.
Planned Statistical Analysis
Primary Objective: The PASI75 response rate w ill be described at Week 16 for subjects on M923 (Arm A) 
vs EU RPP (Arm B).
Secondary Object ive: The sPGA response rate will be described at Week 16for subjects on M923 (Arm A) 
vs EU RPP (Arm B). The treatment arms (Arm A andArm B, as w ell as Arm A to Arm B1 ) will be 
compared using descriptive statistics for PASI50, PASI75, PASI90, and sPGA response rates over time.
Safety Objective: Assess safety.
All treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_289143]
The clinical safety and tolerability of the transition from EU RPP to M923 as compared w ith
continuou s use of EU RPP w ith regard to AEs will be evaluated
Physical examination, vital signs, laboratory parameters, and ECGs will be presented by [CONTACT_289144]
The clinical safety and tolerability of the transition from EU RPP to M923 as compared w ith
continuous use of EU RPP w ill be evaluated using the descriptive statistics provided over time
Pharm acokinetics and immunogenicity : Assess pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity by [CONTACT_113135] e point.
The serum levels will be summarized by  [CONTACT_289145] . Summaries
will be further stratified by [CONTACT_289146] . The within -subject variability in trough
concentrations over time (from Week 17to Week 
41) w ill be determined for each subject and then
compared betw een treatment arms
Transition from EU RPP to M923 as compared w ith continuous use of EU RPP w ith regard to PK
will be evaluated using the descriptive statistics at each schedule time point and statistical
comparison of within -subject variability A summary of the number and percent of subjects testing
positive for ADA or neutralizing antibodies before the dose of M923 or EU RPP and at scheduled
postdose assessments will be presented by [CONTACT_2939]. The time to seroconversion will be
summarized
The number and percentage of subjects who had at least one ADA -positive result will be provided
by [CONTACT_2939]
Immunogenicity following the transition from EU RPP to M923 as compared w ith continuous use
of EU RPP will be evaluated with the number and percentage of s ubjects who had at least once
ADA -positive by [CONTACT_289147]
M923 Page 11 of 82
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_6000] AUG 04
Response Rate Justification: 
Adalimumab response rates were 71.0% (n = 578/814) and 79.6% (n = 86/108) in [ADDRESS_352438] was 63.6% (95% confidence interval of 59.8% - 67.4%), which was used as the basis for sample size calculation.
Primary Analysis
The methods of analysis for the primary outcome measure will be done on the per protocol (PP) population.
The PASI75 response rate will be described at Week 16 for subjects on M923 (Arm A) vs EU RPP
(Arm B). The Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) method will be used to handle missing data.
For the FDA, all equivalence comparisons will be made using 90% confidence intervals and an equivalence 
margin of 18%. For the EMA, all equivalence comparisons will be made using 95% confidence intervals and an equivalence margin of 15%.
A confidence interval for differences between M923 and EU RPP will be calculated using the stratified 
Newcombe confidence interval. 
The null hypothesis of differences in PASI75 proportions of at least 15% for EMA and 18% for FDA will 
be rejected if the 95% confidence interval for EMA and 90% confidence interval for FDA for the difference in PASI75 is wholly contained within the equivalence region; in this case, equivalence will be declared.
The primary analysis will be repeated on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population as a sensitivity analysis.
 
An administrative interim database lock will occur at Week [ADDRESS_352439] from the study team. The study team will remain blinded until final database lock.CCI

M923 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar . HUMIRA®(hereafter referred to as Humira)
is the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) -licensed reference product andcontains adalimumab as the 
active substance. Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 
(IgG1) monoclonal antibody  specific for human tumor necrosis factor –alpha (TNF ) -
alpha . Unlike etanercept, adalimumab does not bind to TNF –beta.
Humira is licensed for use in the US and European Union (EU); Humira approved in the 
EU, which is the Reference Protein Product ( EU RPP) in this study , is not approved for 
use in the US and hence is considered an investigational new drug. Hereafter, Humira 
licensed in the US is referred to as the US Reference Product (US RP), and the 
non-US-approved comparator ( EU-approved Humira) is referred to as the EU RPP.
M923 
injection is a preservative -free, sterile solution for subcutaneous (SC) 
administration and is provided as single -use, 1.0 mL prefilled glass s yringe s that deliver 
40mg (0.8 mL) of M923. M923 is produced b y recombinant deox yribonucleic acid
technology  in a Chinese hamster ovary  mammalian cell expression sy stem and is purified 
by a process that includes specific viral inactivation and removal steps. The amino acid 
sequences of M923 and adalimumab are identical. The M923 formulation has a diff erent 
buffer composition than the EU RPP and the US RP; however, the solution characteristics 
(pH, osmolality ) of M923 are found to be within pre -specified acceptance criteria to those
of the EU RPP and are expected to exhibit corresponding physiologic eff ects. There are 
no new components in the M923 buffer.
The M923 dose selected for this study  is based on the recommend eddose of US RP and 
EU RPP for adult patients with active chronic plaque psoriasis, ie
, an initial dose of 
80mg administered SC, followed by 40mg SCgiven every other week starting 1 week 
after the initial dose
.4The safet y profile of M923 is anticipated to correspond to the EU 
RPP. Investigators should carefully  monitor for all adverse events (AEs), including AEs 
not described as associated with the EU RPP.The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of M923 
is currentl y being evaluated in an ongoing PK Phase 1 clinical study ; results are not y et 
available.

Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_6000] AUG 04
6.2Clinical Condition/Indication
The EU RPP is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis 
in adult patien ts who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are 
intolerant to other sy stemic therapy  including cy closporine, methotrexate (MTX), or 
phototherap y (psoralens and long -wave ultraviolet radiation [ PUVA ]).4
The medical need for a biosimilar to the EU RPP (adalimumab) is demonstrated with 
theapproval and use of the originator product Humira and its place in the treatment 
ofseveral chronic autoimmune or inflammatory  diseases, including rheumatoid 
arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, anky losing spond ylitis, 
Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis.
Provided thatcomparability ofM923 to the EU RPP is demonstrated in all aspects of 
safet y and efficacy, then the medical need for this product is also established .
6.3Population t o Be Studied
The study
 population will include 516 subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque -
type psoriasis. Adult (≥ 18 years) male and female subjects will be considered to be 
eligible provided that they  satisfy  all of the inclusion criteria listed in Section 9.1and 
none of the exclusion criteria listed in Section 9.2.
6.4Findings f rom Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
Multiple lots of the US RP and EU RPP have been extensively  characterized in 
nonclinical pharmacology, PK, and immunogenicity
 studies and compared with the 
investigational M923 proposed adalimumab biosimilar product.  The results of these 
comparisons showed that the biological activities of M923 corresponded to the 
comparators (both US RP and EU RPP). Specifically , the results were within the 
acceptance range for M923 ,EU RPP, and US RP for binding to soluble human TNF- α, 
the human Fcγ receptor, C1q complex, and the human neonatal Fc receptor; activity  in 
the antibody -dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity (ADCC) and complement -dependent 
cytotoxicity  (CDC) assays; potency  in the L929 mouse fibroblast cell line assay ; PK and 
in vitro immunogenicity . APhase 1 PK study  with M923 in healthy  volunteers is 
currentl y ongoing.

Human Subjects
All risks, contraindication s, precautions, dosage and administration considerations, drug 
interactions and overdosage considerations that have been described for Humira (both the 
EURPP and the US RP) apply  to M923 (see A ppendix A of the Investigator’s Brochure 
[IB]for M923). Howev er, investigators should carefully  monitor for all AEs, including 
AEs not described as associated with the EU RPP and the US RP .
6.6Compliance Statement
This study  will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Council
on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, April 1996),

Allother injections will be administered b y the subjects or caregiver at home (but after 
assessments completed if a planned injection date coincides with a planned visit date
[Weeks 29, 33, 41, and 45] ). When injection occurs in the clinic, subjects should be 
observed for [ADDRESS_352458] -injection at Weeks 0, 1, 17, 25, and 37; at 
Weeks 19, 21, 27, and 39, subjects should be observed for 30 minutes after injection .
At any  time during the study , any of the IPs may  be interrupted or discontinued at the 
discretion of the investigator based on his/her evaluation of th e subject’s condition or 
safet y. No dose modification is permitted for this study .
When injection occurs in the clinic, the investigator or a qualified designee will 
evaluate the current injection sites 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) after study  drug 
administration in the clinic at Weeks 0, 1, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27, 37, and 39. 
They sho

consent for continued participat ion and data collection. The reason for withdrawal will be 
recorded on the End of Study eCRF. Assessments to be done at the termination visit 
(including in cases of withdraw alor discontinuation) are describe din Section 10.6 and 
Section 20.2.
Discontinuation (ie, complete withdrawal from study  participation) may  be due to 
dropout (ie, active discontinuation by
 [CONTACT_1130]) or loss to follow -up (ie, discontinuation by  
[CONTACT_279520]). Additionally , the investigator and sponsor have the 
discretion to discontinue any  subje ct from the study  if, in their judgment, continued 
participation would pose an unac ceptable risk for the subject. 
Subjects also will be withdrawn from treatment or discontinued from further study  
participation for the following reasons:
Failure to achieve at least a PASI  50 response at Week 25
The subject becomes pregnant. IP exposure will be discontinued. Attempts will be
made to follow the subject through completion of the pregnancy  and up to [ADDRESS_352467]-delivery , if feasible
. The investigator will recor d a narrative description of
the course of the pregnancy  and its outcome
AEs/SAEs that in the investigator or sponsor opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], poses an unacceptable risk
for continued dosing in the subject
The subject is determined by  [CONTACT_289153] I P, despi[INVESTIGATOR_289108]. The subject will

 All study documents 
(eg, eCRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. Additionally, a uniquely coded SIC(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (eg, collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy.
10.3 Screening and Study Visits
The study site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all 
subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in the eCRFs, regardless of screening outcome. If a subject is re-screened with the approval of the medical advisor, the End of Study eCRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC, and new eCRF are required for that subject.

11.ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY, IMMUNOGENICITY , AND
PHARMACOKINETICS
11.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
The primary  efficacy  outcome measure is the proportion of subjects treated with M923 vs 
EU RPP who achieve a 75% reduction in PASI from W eek 0 (baseline) to Week 1 6of 
the treatment period . Psoriasis will be assessed using the PASI , which is a m easure of the 
average redness, thickness, and scaliness of the lesions (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale, 
weighed b y the area of involvement
. PASI  score will be recorded by  [CONTACT_093]/site 
staff at clinic visits as shown in the schedule in Table 1.
11.[ADDRESS_352481] clear (6 -point scale) 
at Week 16 in subjects treated with M923 vs EU RPP treatment will be assessed. In 
addition, the sPGA response rate of subjects treated with M923 vs 
EU RPP over time will 
be compared. 
The sPGA will be evaluated by  a qualified investigator at the site. The sPGA is the 
physician’s determination of the subject’s psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. 
The sPGA is recommended as an endpoint to use to assess efficacy  in the treatment of 
psoriasis .5Overall lesions are categorized b y descriptions for induration, erythema, and 
scaling. For the ana lysis of responses, the subject’s psoriasis is assessed at a given time 
point on a 6 point scale in which 0 =cleared, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 =moderate, 
4
=severe, 5 = very severe. The sPGA evaluations will be recorded on the eCRF by  [CONTACT_1275]/site staff at clinic visits as shown in the schedule in Table 1.
11.2.2 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
A comparison of the proportion of subjects treated with M923 vs EU RPP who achieve 
50%, 75%, and 90% reductions in psoriasis severity over time , as well as t he response of 
subjects treated with M923 and EU RPP over time based on the absolute PASI  score ,will 
be assessed. 
M923 Page 42of 82
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_6000] AUG 04
The PASI  will be evaluated by a qualified investigator at the site. The PASI combines 
assessments of the extent of body -surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head 
[10% of BSA], arms [20% of BSA], trunk [30% of BSA], and legs [40% of BSA]) and 
the severit y of desquamation (sc aling), ery thema (redness), and induration (thickness) in 
each region, yielding an overall score of [ADDRESS_352482] severe 
disease.6Each of the body  areas is scored by  [CONTACT_5071], and then the four scores are combined 
into the final PASI . For each bod y area, the percent of area of skin involved is estimated 
and then transformed into a score from 0 to 6: 0 = 0% of involved area, 1 = < 10% of 
involved area, 2 = 10% to 29% of involved area, 3 = 30% to 49% of involved area, 
4
=50% to 69% of involved area, 5 = 70% to 89% of involved area, 6= 90% to 100% of 
involved ar ea. Severit y parameters are measured on a five point scale in which 
0 =None, 1= Slight, 2 =Moderate, 3= Severe, 4= Very  Severe. The sum of all 
3severit y parameters is then calculated for each body area, multiplied b y the area score 
for that area and multiplied by  [CONTACT_289160] ( 0.1 for head, 0.2 for arms, 
0.3 for trunk and 0.4 for legs). Subject s achieving PASI  50, 75, 90, or [ADDRESS_352483] 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%, respectivel y, in the PASI  
compared with baseline. Information required to calculate the PASI will be recorded on

11.3 Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Blood samples for anal ysis of serum M923 or EU RPP in terms of serum levels willbe 
collected at the times shown in the schedule in
 Table 1. Samples should be obtained prior 
to administering study  drug if an administration occurs at that visit and before any  
hematology /chemistry  samples to be drawn at that visit. Samples will be collected and 
aliquotted into primary  and back -
up specimens. Back-up specimens should be stored at -
20 °C or -70°C until shipment. Blood sample processing and handling details will be 
presented in a separate laboratory  manual.

[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event s
A SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose meets 1or more of 
the following criteria:
Outcome is fatal/results in death
Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment
of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death had it bee n more severe
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289121] –inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289122] n,
regardless of length of stay
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_289123] y and planned before subject

Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a medicall y important event 
–a medical event that may  not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289124] 1 of the other
outcomes listed in the definitions a bove. Examples of such events are:
Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic
bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in

[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Serious Adverse Event s
A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Events
An unexpected AE is an AE whose nature, sev erity, specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safet y 
Information (eg, IB, package insert). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.
For the purposes of this study , each unexpected AE reported by a subject undergoing 
study treatment or a study -related procedure will be recorded on the AE eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Diseases
Preexisting diseases that are present before entry  in to the study  are described in the 
medical history, and those that manifest with the same severity , frequency , or duration 
after IP exposure, will not be recorded as A Es. However, when there is an increase in the 
severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on 
the AE eCRF.
12.1.[ADDRESS_352488] undergoing study -related procedure(s) before the first M923 or EU RPP
treatment will be recorded on the AE eCRF; however, these events will not be considered 
as AEs and will not be included in the anal ysis of AEs.
Each treatment -emergent AE (non-serious AE or SAE) from the first M923 or EU RPP
treatment until study  completion/discontinuation (Week 48) or [ADDRESS_352489] 
M923 or EU RPP treatment (for earl y termination subjects) will be described on the AE 
eCRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis could be established at 
the time of reporting the AE, a s ymptom or sign, in standard medical terminology  in 
order to avoid the us e of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition in 
Section 12.1). Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for:
Seriousness as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Severity  as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
M923 Page 46of 82
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_6000] AUG 04
Causal relationship to I P exposure or study  procedure as defined in
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if 
applicable action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug 
interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE 
eCRF. Recovering/resol ving A Es will be followed until resolution, medically  stabilized, 
or 30 day s after the study comp letion/termination visit, whichever comes first. If the 
severit y rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE 
report will be revised (ie, the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the 
course of an y AE, the highes t severit y rating will be reported.
Deviations from the protocol- specified dosage ( including overdosing [any  dose that is at 
least 20% higher than the highest explored dose level], underdosing [an y dose that is 
lower than the intended explored dose level b y 10%], abuse, and withdrawal [see 
Section 9.3]) , treatm ent errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an 
incorrect product, and de viations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of 
expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be 
followed with regard to occurrence of A Es, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations 
because these events may  be reportable to regulatory  authorities.
Any pregnancy  that occurs after administration of M923 or EU RPP will be reported on a 
Pregnancy  Form and followed -up at [ADDRESS_352490] be reported on the SAE Form within 24 hours after 
awareness ; no additional reporting on eCRFs is necessary .
A post -trialSAE report (SAER) form in paper 
will be used to report SAEs after a 
subject’s completion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity
The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and 
judgment based on the most appropriate description below:
Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant
manner wi th the subject’s normal functioning level
M923 Page 47of 82
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_6000] AUG 04
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require minimal therapeutic
intervention
Moderate
The AE produces limited impairment of function and may  require therapeutic
intervention
The AE produces no sequela/sequelae
Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may  lead to
temporary  inability  to resume usual life pattern
The AE produces sequela/sequelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic
intervention
These severity  definitions will also be used to assess the severit y of an AE
with a study  related procedure(s), if necessary
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the I P is 
etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality
 assessment includes, eg, 
assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association 
(or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely  
cause, and ph ysiological plausibility .For each AE, the investigator will as sess the causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment 
according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
Not related (both circumstances must be met)
Is due to underl ying or
concurrent illness, complications, concurrent
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs
Is not associated with the IP (ie, does not follow a reasonable temporal
relationship to the administration of I P or has a much more likel y alternative
etiology )
Unlikely  related (either 1 or both circumstances are met)
Has little or no temporal relationship to the I P
A more likely  alternative etiology  exists
Possibly  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the administr ation of I P
M923 Page 48of 82
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_6000] AUG 04
An alternative etiology  is equally  or less likely  compared with the potential
relationship to the I P
Probably  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a 
strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P, which may
include but is not limited to the following :
oReappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration (positive
rechallenge)
oPositive results in a drug sensitivity  test (skin test, etc.)
oToxic level of the I P as evidenced by  [CONTACT_279525] I P
concentrations in the blood or other bodily  fluid
Another etiology  is unlikely  or significantly  less likely
For events assessed as not related or unlikel y related and occurring within 72 hours after 
IP administration , the investigator shall provide the alternative etiology . These causality  
definitions will also be used to assess the relationship of an AE with a study -
related 
procedure(s), if necessary.

12.6 Physical Examinations
At screening and subsequent study  visits (as described in Table 1), a phy sical 
examination will be done on the following bod y systems: general appearance, head and 
neck, ey es and ears, nose and throat, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities and joints, 
lymph nodes, skin, and neurological. Details regarding the procedures and tests to be 
conducted at the complete and brief ph ysical exams are provided in the Schedule of 
Study  Procedures and Assessments 
(Table 1). At screening, if an abnormal condition is 
detected, the condition will be described on the medical history  eCRF. At study  visits, if a 
new abnormal or worsened abnormal pre -existing condition is detected, the condition will 
be described on the AE e
CRF. If the abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it 
was due to an error, due to a preexisting disease (describ ed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), not 
clinically  significant, a sy mptom of a new/worsened condition already  recorded as an AE, 
or due to another issue that will be specified, the investigator will record the justification 
on the source record.

12.7.3 Assessment of Laboratory Values
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values
The investigator will assess each laboratory  value . For each abnormal laboratory  value, 
the investigator will determine whether the value is considered clinically  significant or 
not. For clinicall y significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value 
constitutes a new AE (see definition in 
Section 12.1, and record the sign, sy mptom, 
ormedical diagnosis on the AE eCRF), is a sy mptom or related to a previously  
recorded AE, is due to a pre
-existing disease (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), or is due 
toanother issue that will be specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically  
significant, the investigator will indicate the reason (ie, because it is due to a 
preexisting disease, due to a lab oratory error, due to variation within the healthy
population, or due to another issue that will be specified). 
M923 Page 52of 82
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_6000] AUG 04
Additional tests andother evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology  of 
an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically  
indicated. An y abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
12.8 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include body  temperature ( °C or ° F), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (breaths/min), pulse 
rate (beats/min), and s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg). 
Height (in or cm ; 
screening visit only ) and weight (lb or kg) will also be collected.
Vital signs will be measured at screening and prior to administration of M923 or EU 
RPP, at each study  visit , and at study  completion/termination. Blood pressure will be 
measured when subjects are in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_289126] 5 minutes.
Vital sign values are to be recorded on the eCRF. For each abnormal vital sign value, the 
investigator will determine whether or not to report an AE (see definit ion in Section 12.[ADDRESS_352497] the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign on the AE e CRF ).
Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology  of 
an abnormal value , or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically  
indicated. An y abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the 
investigator.
12.9 E lectrocardiograms
A 12 -lead ECG is done at study  visits according to the schedule described in Table 1.The 
following parameters will be recorded in the eCRF : ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS 
duration, QT ,and QT interval corrected for heart rate using Frideri
cia’s equation (QTcF). 
QTcF will be calculated as follows: QTcF = QT /(3√RR).
ECGs done at regular study  visits will be interpreted locall y.

13. STATISTICS
13.1 Sample Size and Power Calculations13.1.1 Sample Size Calculation
Primary analysis: Test equivalence of M923 compared with EU RPP using the PASI75 
response rate at 16 weeks,  
 
 A total of 516 subjects will be randomized (258 in Arm A and 258 in Arm B) 
Response Rate Justification: 
Adalimumab response rates were 71.0% (n = 578/814) and 79.6% (n = 86/108) in 
[ADDRESS_352500] was 63.6% (95% confidence interval of 59.8% - 67.4%), which was used as the basis for sample size calculation.
Equivalence Margin Justification:
The treatment effect versus placebo, based on PASI75 at 16 weeks from a Phase 1 study 
(REVEAL
1), was estimated to be 0.647 (lower bound of 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval0.460).
The treatment effect versus placebo, based on PASI75 at 16 weeks from the other pi[INVESTIGATOR_289127] 3 study (CHAMPI[INVESTIGATOR_45372]2), was estimated to be 0.64 (lower bound of 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval 0.597). 
Margin for [LOCATION_003]:
An 18% equivalence margin was selected based on observed variation in response 
rates in adalimumab’s Phase 23vs Phase 3 studies at 12 weeks, and on the statistical 
(M1) margins in the Phase 3 studies at 16 weeks. Based on the meta-analysis of the REVEAL and CHAMPI[INVESTIGATOR_289128], the 95% confidence bound for the difference in proportions of PASI75 is 0.5975 to 0.6744.  The acceptable margins (M1) statistically from the Phase 3 studies were 0.298 at 16 weeks. The proposed margin of 18% preserves 70% of the treatment effect, and is well within both the inter-trial variation in response rates and the M1 from Phase 3 and comprises a conservative margin for assessment of equivalence.

Margin for EU:
An 15% equivalence margin was selected based on observed variation in response rates 
in adalimumab’s Phase 23vs Phase 3 studies at 12 weeks , and on the statistical (M1) 
margins in the Phase 3 studies at 1 6weeks. Based on the meta -analy sis of the REVEAL1
and CHAMPI[INVESTIGATOR_45372]2studies, the 95% confidence bound for the difference in proportions of 
PASI 75 is 0.5975 to 0.6744.  The acceptable margins (M1) statistically  from the Phase 3 
studies were 0.298 at 16 week s. The proposed margin of 15% preserves 75% of the 
treatment effect, and is well within both the inter -trial variation in response rates and the 
M1 from Phase 3 and comprises a conservative margin for assessment of equivalence. 
13.2 Populations and Analysis Cohorts
Intent -to-treat (ITT):
The ITT population will include all consenting subjects randomized to study  treatment 
(Arm A or Arm B). Subjects will be assigned to treatment groups based on 
randomization.
Per-Protocol (PP):
The PP population is a subgroup of the ITT population which will include all subjects
who do not have an y major protocol deviatio ns and received at least 1dose of study  
medication . 
Major protocol deviation s will include, but are not limited to: deviation of 
inclusion/exclusion criter ia, administration of prohibited medication sand erroneous 
administration of study  treatment. The criteria for grading protocol deviation s will be 
established by  [CONTACT_289165] . Major protocol deviation s will 
be determined on a c ase-by-case basis by  [CONTACT_289166]. Subjects will be assigned to treatment groups based on randomization .
Safety:
The safet y population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study  
medication (M923 or 
EU RPP ). Subjects will be assigned to treatment groups based on 
what they  actually  received.
Pharmacokinetics (PK):
The PK population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication (M923 or EU RPP ) and have at least [ADDRESS_352501] incomplete data, a decision will be made on a case -by-case 
basis as to their inclusion in the anal ysis.

13.3 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data
Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) for Clinical Response: Subjects will be considered 
as non-responders for the NRI  anal ysis if they  do not meet the clinical response criteria 
for categorical responses (PASI 50, PA SI75, PASI90, sPGA) at a time point of interest 
(Week 16). All non- responders at Week 16, as well as all subjects who discontinue study  
treatment prior to Week [ADDRESS_352502] (mBOCF): The continuous 
efficacy and health outcome variables will be based on a modified baseline observation 
carried forward (mBOCF) approach. For subjects who discontinue the study  treatment 
due to AE , the baseline observation will be carried forward to the corresponding time 
point for evaluation. For subjects who discontinued the study  treatment due to any  
other reason, the last non- missing observation befo re discontinuation will be carried 
forward to the corresponding time point for evaluation. Randomized subjects without
atleast [ADDRESS_352503]-baseline observation will not be included for evaluation with the exception 
of subjects who discontinued the study  treatment due to AE .
Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM): As a supportive analy sis, continuous 
endpoints will be imputed based on mixed -effects model repeated measures (MMRM) for 
the ITT population8. Categorical endpoints derived from continuous measures will be 
derived from the imputed continuous measure. 
13.[ADDRESS_352504] deviation ,median, minimum ,and maximum.  Categorical variables will 
be summarized in frequency  tables (n, frequencies, and percentages).  Individual subject 
data will be presented in listings.
The study  consists of a treatment period of [ADDRESS_352505] 1 6weeks. 
The default significant level will be (5%); confidence intervals will be 95% and all tests 
will be 2-sided, unless otherwise specified in the description of the analy ses.Details of 
the statistical analy sis will be specified in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP), which will 
be finalized prior to treatment assignment unblinding. The SAP will contain the details of 
the missing data modeling, including model specification, the anal ysis of the secondary  
and pharmacokinetic endpoints, and the presentation of safet y data.

disposition and withdrawals, and protocol deviation s
(including inclusion and exclusion 
criteria ) will be presented for the ITT population.
13.4.2 Demographic and other Baseline Characteristics
Demographic data and other baseline ch aracteristics will be described for the ITT and PP 
populations overall and by  [CONTACT_2939]. No statistical testing will be carried out for 
demographic or other baseline character istics.
13.4.3 Primary Outcome Measure
The methods of anal ysis for the primary  outcome measure (see Section 8.4) will be done
on the PP population.
The PASI 75 response rate will be described at Week 16forsubjects on M923 (Arm A) vs 
EU RPP (Arm B). The NRI  method (see Section 13.3) will be used to handle missing 
data.
For the FDA, all equivalence comparisons will be made using 90% confidence intervals 
and an equivalence margin of 18%. For the EMA, all equivalence comparisons will be 
made using 95% confidence intervals and an equivalence margin of 15%.
Aconfidence interval for difference sbetween M923 and EU RPP will be c alculated 
using the Newcombe confidence interval .9
;10The null hy pothesis of differences in 
PASI [ADDRESS_352507] 15% for EMA and 18% for FDA will be rejected i f the 
95% confidence interval for EMA and 90% confidence interval for FDA for the 
difference in PASI75 is wholly  contained within the equivalence region; in this case, 
equivalence will be declared.
The primary  anal ysis will be repeated on the ITT population as a sensitivity  analy sis
using the 
NRI, mBOCF ,and MMRM methods of imputation .The MMRM model will 
include baseline, treatment group (A , B1, or B2), region (North America, Western 
Europe, or Eastern Europe), and the treatment -by-visit interaction. An unstructured 
variance -covariance matrix will be estimated. If the procedure fails to converge then the 
treatment -by-visit term will be removed from the model. If the model still fails to 
converge, a heterogeneous Toeplitz structure will be used for the variance -covariance 
matrix. The Kenward -Roger method will be used for estimating degrees of freedom.11

13.4.4 Secondary Outcome Measures 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy
The methods of analysis for the secondary efficacy outcome measures (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be done on the PP population and repeated on the ITT population.
The sPGA response rate will be described at Week 16 for subjects on M923 (Arm A) vs 
EU RPP (Arm B). 
The NRI method (see Section 13.3 ) will be used to handle missing data. A 95% 
confidence interval for differences between M923 and EU RPP will be calculated using the stratified Newcombe confidence interval.
The treatment arms (Arm A and Arms B1 and B2) will be compared using descriptive 
statistics for PASI50, PASI75, PASI90, and sPGA response rates over time. The NRI method (see Section 13.3 ) will be used to handle missing data.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety
The methods of analysis for the secondary safety outcome measures (see  Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
will be done on the safety population.
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary.CCI

Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AE s that started or worsened 
in severity  on or after the first dose of study  medication.
All TEAEs (i ncluding SAEs, AEs related to study  drug, AEs leading to discontinuation ,
and injection site reactions) will be summarized by S ystem Organ Class and Preferred 
Term and b y treatment arm (Arm A andArms B 1 and B2 ). All AEs will be included in 
the listings (non-TEAEs and TEAEs).
The clinical safet y and tolerability of the transition from EU RPP to M923 as compared

using the descriptive statistics provided over time.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
The methods of anal ysis for the secondary  PK outcome measures (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
will be done on the PK population.
The serum levels will be summarized by  [CONTACT_289145]. I n 
addition to descr iptive statistics described in Section 13.4, the geometric mean, 
corresponding 95% confidence interval, and the geometric coefficient of variation (CV) 
will also be presented. To evaluate whether of anti- adalimumab antibody  formation will 
affect exposure, the summaries will be further stratified by [CONTACT_289146] (subjects who 
did not form antibodies, subjects who formed ADAs, versus subjects who formed 
neutralizing ADAs). The within -subject variability (CV) in trough concentrations over 
time (from Week 1 7 to Week 41) will be determined for each subject, which will then be 
compared between treatment arms using an anal ysis of variance model wit h treatment as 
a fixed effect.

13.[ADDRESS_352509] 516 randomized subjects . The purpose of the interim database lock is 
to provide an anal ysis of the primary  endpoint , safety , PK and immunogenicity  up 
through Week 25 to regulatory  agencies before the completion of the study. No trial -
related decisions will be made based on the interim analy sis. Sinc e no trial -related 
decisions will be made based on this anal ysis, the Ty pe I error rate is preserved and no 
multiplicity  adjustment is needed. An interim clinical study  report from the interim 
analysis week 25 (primary  endpoint) will be to support regulatory  submission s.

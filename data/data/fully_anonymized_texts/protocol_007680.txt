 SCHEMA 
 
OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_871777] 
(CBT -I) on changes in circulating levels of high sensitivity C -reactive protein ( hsCRP ) at 24 weeks in 
virologically -suppressed, HIV -positive adults  with insomnia, defined as having an Insomnia Severity Index 
(ISI) score ≥ 11. Secondary objectives include comparing changes in hsCRP at 12 weeks, changes in other circulating inflammation biomarkers (IL -6, sCD14, sCD163, CD14+CD16+ monocytes)  at both [ADDRESS_1217655] 25% women in to this trial, or 
12 of the 50 to be randomized. These participants will be randomized 1:1 (stratified by [CONTACT_871807]/medications ) to either the internet CBT -I program SHUT i (N=25) or an internet sleep education/  
hygiene  Active C ontrol  (N=25). Four study visits are required (Screening, Entry, Week 12, and Week 24) .  
 
DURATION  
Each individual participant  will be followed for up to 30 weeks  (up to 6 weeks between Screening and  
Randomization/Entry and then 24 weeks after Randomization) .  
 
POPULATION  
All participants  will be HIV -positive , [ADDRESS_1217656] six months with an HIV viral load < 75 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at Screening, and have an ISI score ≥ 11 at Screening. Participants  will be recruited from the infectious diseases /HIV  outpatie nt clinics of Eskenazi  Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871778] (IUH) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].

2.0 HYPOTHESES, SIGNIFICANCE, AND BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Hypotheses  
 
2.1.1 Insomnia treatment with SHUTi will reduce  circulating hsCRP compared to sleep education/hygiene  
Active Control  at 24 weeks. 
 2.1.2 Insomnia treatment with SHUTi will reduce circulating hsCRP at 12 weeks and IL-6, sCD14, sCD163, 
and C D14+CD16+ intermediate monocyte levels at both 12 and 24 weeks  compared to sleep

 2.1.4 Effects of i nsomnia treatment with SHUTi on inflammation may be moderated by [CONTACT_871808], ISI, insomnia pharmacologic treatment, depression status, substance use, and CRP level, and may be mediated by [CONTACT_871809], behavioral changes, a nd HIV virologic rebound. 
 2.2 Significance and Background 
 
2.2.1 Significance. With the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), t he lifespans of people with HIV  (PWH) are 
nearing those of the HIV-negative population (1 -4). However, this increase in survival is acco mpanied by a 
 
July 29, 2022  4 
 growing incidence of serious non- AIDS events (SNAE), including diabetes, osteoporosis, chronic kidney 
disease, neurocognitive decline, pulmonary dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease (5 -8).  
Persistently elevated systemic in flammation [as measured by [CONTACT_871810] C -reactive 
protein (hsCRP) and interleukin- 6 (IL -6)] and evidence of monocyte activation [as measured by [CONTACT_245140]14, 
sCD163, and pro- inflammatory intermediate CD14+16+ monocytes] are strongly associated wi th the 
development of these SNAE, despi[INVESTIGATOR_871780] (9 -16). Because pharmacologic 
interventions (apart from ART itself and variably with statins) have not yet proven effective in reducing 
inflammation in PWH, there is a critical need to identify alternative and innovative strategies.  
Targeting insomnia may be one such novel strategy to reduce HIV -related inflammation. In the general 
population, i nsomnia is associated with greater systemic inflammation  (17) , as measured by [CONTACT_871811] -6 (18, 19) . Importantly, in a  randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) of 123 older, 
HIV-negative adults with insomnia disorder  (20, 21) , cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT -I) 
reduced hsCRP . However, it remains unknown if CBT -I similarly reduces systemic inflammation in PWH on 
ART.  
This single -center , phase II RCT evaluating the effect of Sleep Healthy Using The Internet ( SHUTi), on 
systemic inflammation in PWH is highly significant for several reasons: (1) A positive phase II trial would generate the critical proof -of-concept data and effect size estimates needed to justify and properly design a 
multicenter, phase III RCT to establish the long- term effects of SHUTi on systemic inflammation and SNAE. 
As we have ongoing relationships with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, implementing s uch a trial is feasible in 
our hands. (2) A positive phase III trial would identify a novel target (insomnia) for SNAE prevention efforts and would suggest that clinical management guidelines for PWH should, for the first time, include insomnia 
screening and treatment to improve physical health outcomes. (3) A positive phase III trial would also equip healthcare systems with a new practical and scalable intervention (SHUTi) to help lower SNAE risk. Importantly, SHUTi avoids drug dependence and drug interact ion concerns associated with some 
pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_871781] -I, 
which are in short supply. Thus, given the high prevalence of insomnia in PWH, this application may lead to 
wide spread, clinically relevant changes to improve the lives of PWH.  
 
2.2.2 Insomnia, Inflammation, and Chronic Diseases in the General Population. Insufficient sleep  is a highly 
prevalent and harmful health behavior that contributes to poor mental and physica l health outcomes (22) . Here, 
insufficient sleep is defined as the presence of insomnia – frequent and persistent difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep causing functional impairment or distress  (23-25). A 2006 Institute of Medicine report (26)  
stated that promoting sufficient sleep  may alter the adverse mental and physical health aging trajectories of 
vulnerable adults.  
Insomnia  is the most prevalent sleep disorder and  is a major public health concern (27). Insomnia 
afflicts millions of U.S. adults, with 12- 20% having insomnia disorder (28, 29)  and 30- 50% having insomnia 
symptoms (30, 31) . Insomnia is typi[INVESTIGATOR_155650]  (32, 33) , and its serious ramifications include absenteeism and 
accidents (34); the development of psychiatric disorders (35);  the development of chronic diseases, ( including 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia)  (36-42); and high total annual costs (43, 44) . 
While it is not uncommon for insomnia to be conceptualized as a depressive symptom in clinical 
settings, current diagnostic manuals (e.g., DSM -5) assert that insomnia is not simply a symptom of other 
conditions and exists as a clinical problem warranting attention as an independent diagnosis – regardles s of 
medical and psychiatric comorbidities, including depression (45, 46) . Moreover, research examining the 
directionality between insomnia and depression consistently finds that insomnia increases the risk of future depression (47, 48)  and less consistently finds that depression increases the risk of future insomnia (33, 49- 52). 
This suggests that insomnia manifests independent ly of depression.  
Importantly, there are rigorous genomic association data suggesting causal associations between 
insomnia and incident chronic diseases, similar to SNAE in PWH, in the general population. In the largest 
genome -wide association study ( GWAS ) study to date, Mendelian randomization analyses showed highly 
 
July 29, 2022  5 
 significant (P<10-8) direct risk effect s of insomnia on type 2 diabetes (OR=1.86) and CVD with no reverse risk 
effect of these conditions on insomnia  (53) . Another GWAS study (54)  confirmed this significant causal 
association between insomnia symptoms and CVD (OR=2.15; P<0.001), which was then validated in a second 
cohort (OR=2.95; P<10-12).  
It is plausible that the increased risk of chronic diseases due to insomnia is mediated through systemic 
inflammation (17, 55- 62). Insomnia is associated with greater sympathetic activation (63)  and subsequent NF -
κB upregulation, which, in turn, leads to greater pro- inflammatory activation, as marked by [CONTACT_871812] -6 levels (64). Critically, evidence suggest that this relationship between insomnia and 
inflammation is  causal . In a recently completed RCT (21) , 123 HIV -negative adults with insomnia  were 
randomized to 4 months of face -to-face CBT -I, Tai Chi Chin (TCC), or sleep seminar (SS) education control.  
For the primary outcome of insomnia disorder remission at Month 4, CBT -I (54%) outperformed TCC (30%; 
P<0.05) and SS education control (21%; P <0.01). For the s econdary outcome of high hsCRP [ ≥3.0 mg/L, a  
commonly used threshold for higher CVD risk (65)] , CBT -I also outperformed TCC and SS at Month 16 ( both 
P=0.04). Moreover, hsCRP  levels at Month 16 were lower in participants with insomnia remission (1.5 mg/L) 
versus in those without insomnia remission (2.8 mg/L; P <0.05). The improvement in hsCRP with CBT -I is 
likely clinically relevant in PWH, as this difference in hsCRP was associated with a significant 2 -fold reduction 
in risk of incident CVD, a key SNAE, in the SMART trial comparing continuous vs interrupte d ART  (66). 
 
2.2.3 Insomnia and inflammation in HIV . A meta -analysis of self -reported sleep disturbances in 9246 PWH 
suggested a high insomnia prevalence rate of 58% (67). There are likely multiple contributors to this high 
prevalence, including HIV stigma, direct effects of HIV on the CNS, s tress, substance use, anxiety, cognitive 
impairment, and adverse effects of certain ART drugs (efavirenz, rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], integrase inhibitors) on the CNS (68-73). However, CD4 count and HIV -1 RNA level wer e not associated with insomnia (68) .  
 The literature on the associations between insomnia and heightened inflammation in PWH is more 
limited than in the general population but appear to support similar relationships. The  three studies ident ified 
(74-76) used the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_871782]. A total of 641 HIV -positive  participants  in total were included (70%  male, 66% non-
white race/ethnicity , 71% on ART). There were greater circulating levels of hsCRP and IL -6 in tho se with less 
total sleep time (74) ; greater circulating IL -13 in those with longer sleep onset (75) , and greater circulating IL -6 
in those with higher fatigue (76) . Thus, sleep disturbances likely do contribute to the greater systemic 
inflammation known to occur in PWH. However, these observational data could not establish causality. This trial will address this gap.   
2.2.4 Treatment of Insomnia with SHUTi. In 2005, an NIH panel concluded that CBT -I is the treatment of 
choice for insomnia (77) . The [ADDRESS_1217658] their top recommendation that "all 
adult patients receive CBT -I as the initial treatmen t for chronic insomnia disorder," given the strong evidence  
that it is safe, effective, and broadly applicable with durable benefits  (78) . The most recent meta- analysis  (79)  
showed that CBT -I’s effect size is large for insomnia symptoms ( Hedge’s g=0.98); moderate -to-large for sleep 
efficiency (g=0.71), sleep quality (g=0.65), wake after sleep onset (g=0.63), and sleep latency (g=0.57; all P<0.05). CBT -I’s effect sizes are similar regardless of  comorbid medical/psychiatric conditions , use of sleep 
medications, or age (78-80). RCTs with longer -term follow -ups show that the sleep improvements with CBT -I 
are sustained, whereas those with sleep medications are not  (81, 82) .  
A shortcoming of CBT -I, however, is its limited availability due to a shortage of clinicians trained in 
this approach (83 -85). In addition, patients may not be able to attend sessions with a CBT -I therapi[INVESTIGATOR_871783]. To address these issues, SHUTi  (86)  – a self -guided, fully automated, interactive, 
and tailored internet CBT -I program that is fully accessible via tablets and smartphones  – was developed . In one 
RCT (N=303), adults who received SHUTi, versus insomnia education, exhibited greater improvements in insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI) score]  at post -treatment, 6 months, and 12 months ( Cohen’s 
d=1.90- 2.32 in the SHUTi arm)  (87) . Notably, outcomes did not differ in people with and without 
 
July 29, 2022  6 
 medical/psychiatric comorbidities. In yet another RCT (N=1,149), the SHUTi arm, versus an internet attention-
control arm, had lower insomnia symptoms at 6 wee ks (d=1.10) and 6 months (d=0.83)  (88) . Our small pi[INVESTIGATOR_871784] (ISI score) over a 10- week period compared 
to usual care in PWH with ISI score ≥  11. Collectively, these findings indicate that SHUTi has a rapid, 
meani ngful, and lasting positive impact on insomnia.  
 
2.3 Preliminary Studies  
 
2.3.1 Insomnia is associated with SNAE in HIV . Given our group’s interest in the relationships between 
mental health disorders and SNAE in PWH, we have published several studies from the Veterans Aging  Cohort 
Study (VACS) showing that depression, defined either by [CONTACT_871813] -9 (PHQ -9) scale, is associated with higher rates of incident myocardial infarction, heart failure, 
and all -cause mortality in HIV -positive adults (89 -91). We have now published our VACS study evaluating the 
associations of insomnia on a key SNAE, incident cardiovascular disease (92). We included 3108 participants (median age 49 years, 97% male, 66% African -American, median  CD4 370 cells/µL, median HIV -1 RNA 400 
c/mL, 80% on ART) who were enrolled starting in 2002 with follow -up through 2014. Insomnia was measured 
with the “Difficulty falling or staying asleep” item on the VACS HIV Symptom Index. Response options ranged from  0 (“I do not have this symptom”) to 4 (“I have this symptom, and it bothers me a lot”). At 
enrollment, 59% endorsed some level of insomnia (scores 1 -4). We found that PWH who scored a 4, versus 
those scoring 0, were at a 62- 70% increased risk of incident CVD events (myocardial infarction, coronary artery 
revascularization, or stroke; 267 events) over the 11- year follow -up period. These associations were 
independent of demographics, traditional CVD risk factors, additional potential confounders (hepatitis C  
infection, renal disease, anemia, alcohol use, cocaine use), HIV -specific factors (CD4 count, HIV -1 RNA level, 
ART use), and sleep medication use. Overall, these findings demonstrate that insomnia is another mental health disorder with long- term, clinically significant, adverse consequences in PWH. 
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1217659] now published our pi[INVESTIGATOR_277647] 54 PWH on virologically- suppressive ART with PHQ -9 scores ≥10 (indicating high likelihood of a 
depress ive disorder) who were randomized 1:1 to either the use of an internet CBT program for depression 
(Beating the Blues -US™  (BtB) , N=27), which includes 8 weekly treatment session, or Usual Care (UC, N=27) 
(93). Three and two participants, respectively, were lost to follow -up over 24 weeks (9% overall attrition). 
There were no restrictions on use of depression therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (pharmacologic or behavioral) nor on types of ART regimens. We found that BtB significantly r educed PHQ -9 scores over 24 weeks compared to UC, indicating 
persistent BtB effects well beyond the initial treatment period. Moreover, the intervention significantly reduced sCD163 levels and proportions of pro- inflammatory, intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes (Table 1). The 
intervention also led to non- significantly greater reductions in hsCRP, IL -6, and sCD14 levels. Overall, these 
data strongly suggest that internet CBT treatment of a mood disorder can directly improve markers of systemic inflammation and  monocyte immune activation in PWH.

SHUTi versus usual care (UC) on insomnia symptoms in PWH with screening Insomnia Severity Scores (ISI) 
≥11, indicating clinically relevant insomnia. Participants were on ART (8 of 10 in each group were receiving dolutegravir or bictegravir; 2 each on rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], none on efavirenz) with HIV -1 RNA levels <75c/mL; 85% 
were Black and 85% male. The number of study completers was 6 of 10 and 8 of 10 in the SHUTi and UC arms, respectively. T he attrition rate was primarily due to lack of consistent internet availability for some 
participants. The mean number of SHUTi sessions completed was 4.8 (SD=1.2) out of 6. Mean (SD) baseline ISI scores in the SHUTi [18.3 (7.8)] and UC [20.5 (5.5)] groups  were similarly high. Mean (SD) reductions in 
ISI scores at 10 weeks with SHUTi versus usual care [ -9.0 (9.4) vs. - 3.4 (2.0); P=0.21] were not statistically 
significantly different due to low power, but the effect size was large with a Cohen’s d=0.82. We f ound even 
greater reductions in the SHUTi subgroup (SHUTi
4-6) who completed at least 4 of the 6 planned sessions  
[n=4; - 12.8 (9.6); P=0.15 compared to UC; Cohen’s d=1.36]. Our effect sizes are similar to those found by 
[CONTACT_871814] (87)  in the large RCT of SHUTi in the general population. These results support the efficacy of 
SHUTi in the viro logically -controlled PWH, most of whom were on integrase inhibitors. Because the budget for 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_871785], we could not assess changes in inflammatory biomarkers.  
 2.4 Study Rationale  
 
The extant literature indicates  that insomnia is a risk factor for chronic disease in the general population. 
Moreover, our published data suggests this relationship holds in PWH, as having highly bothersome insomnia symptoms is associated with incident CVD in PWH. There is strong and r igorous evidence that insomnia is 
associated with greater levels of systemic inflammation and that treatment of insomnia using CBT -I reduces 
hsCRP levels in the general population. Similarly, our published pi[INVESTIGATOR_871786]. Finally, our small pi[INVESTIGATOR_871787] -I (SHUTi) in PWH reduces insomnia symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_871815]. What remains unknown is whether treatin g insomnia with internet CBT -I improves systemic 
inflammation in PWH.  Thus, this trial will fill this critical knowledge gap in preparation for a definitive, end -
point driven multicenter RCT of SHUTi on SNAE.  
Our long- term goal is to reduce the risk of SN AE in adult PWH . The central objective of this study is to 
evaluate SHUT i’s ability to reduce systemic inflammation, and, in particular, monocyte activation in PWH. A 
positive phase II trial would provide the proof -of-concept data and effect size estimates  needed to justify and 
properly design an R01- funded phase III RCT to establish the long- term effects of SHUTi (a practical and 
readily scalable intervention) on HIV -related inflammation and prevention of SNAE.  
  
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 3.1  Overview  
 The hypotheses of this study will be tested by [CONTACT_746] a 24- week, single -center, single -blinded, two-
arm, parallel -group, randomized (1:1), controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_871788] -I (SHUTi) with an  internet  
Active Control (sleep education/hygiene) in 50 HIV -positive patients receiving virologically- suppressive ART 
and with insomnia. Our primary endpoint will be changes in hsCRP levels based on the Irwin trial (21) in HIV -
negative persons. Our secondary endpoints include changes in IL-6 and measures of monocyte activation 
(sCD14, sCD163, CD14+CD16+ monocytes) , given our results with internet CBT in depressed PWH. 
Importantly, each of these measures is  associated with SNAE and thus have mechanistic and clinical relevance.  
 3.2  Screening Visit/Eligibility Assessment  
 
July 29, [ADDRESS_1217661] insomnia defined as having an Insomnia 
Severity Index (ISI) score ≥ 11. To assess for this Screening eligibility criterion, we will employ two methods. 
First, w e will conduct in -person screen ing using the ISI in the Eskenazi  and IUH Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871789]. Second, 
after provision of verbal consent by [CONTACT_52764], we will conduct phone screening using the ISI for patients who either self -refer for the study  or who are r eferred by [CONTACT_871816]- person ISI screening in the clinics. In the latter situation, we will also employ EMR tools 
in EPIC and CERNER to identify potential participants first and then request approval by [CONTACT_102]’s HIV provider to contact [CONTACT_102]. 
Patients with ISI scores ≥ 11 will be asked by [CONTACT_229656]- clinic or phone screeners  if they wish to be 
contact[CONTACT_871817]. If so, these patients will be referred to the study team. The study team will then further assess eligibility by [CONTACT_871818]’s  medical and 
laboratory records.  HIV-1 RNA levels (viral loads)  obtained as standard of care within 42 days (before or after) 
of the ISI positive screening result can be used to assess eligibility. If the HIV viral load data are not available within this timeframe, then an in -person Screening Visit will be scheduled to perform this test.  Those eligible 
after review of medi cal and laboratory results will then be scheduled for their Entry/Randomization Visit.  
 
3.3 Entry/Randomization Visit  
 
Participants will be scheduled for this Entry/Randomization Visit within [ADDRESS_1217662]  (UPT) will then be performed before 
randomization and other requir ed study procedures. If the UPT is positive, study participation will end. 
Otherwise, r andomiza tion and the other study procedures for this visit will continue. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_680713]  (male/female)  and by [CONTACT_871819] r (≥ 2 times/week) use of prescribed or over -the-
counter sleep aids/medications  (yes/no)  using random number sequences . Sequentially numbered, opaque, 
sealed envelopes containing treatment assignment will be prepared by [CONTACT_4305].  
At this visit, updated medical /psychiatric  records , current medications , and current behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_871790]. H eight, weight, and vital signs will be measured and recorded . All participant s 
will complete a questionnaire battery c ontaining the following: standard q uestions assessing demographics, 
medical/psychiatric history, s leep mediation use , insomnia treatment satisfaction, and insomnia care received 
outside of the trial; ISI; PSQI ; DBAS -16; P HQ-9; SCL-20; GAD- 7; PROMIS
® Fatigue Short Form ; AUDIT ; 
PEG -3; and SF -36. The questionnaire battery will also include validated scales assessing physical activity  level , 
tobacco use, illicit drug use, medication adherence , and the probability of sleep apnea (STOP -BANG 
Questionnaire  (94)) . The questionnaire  battery  will be ad ministered on a computer in private with availability of 
the study team to assist only when asked by [CONTACT_2299]. The participant may refuse to complete any of  the 
questionnaire  items .  
We will then obtain whole blood samples for laboratory testing of the inflammation biomarkers of 
interest and for updated HIV -1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. We will also archive blood samples  for future 
testing if consent for this is provided by [CONTACT_2299]. Of note, study participants do not need to be fasting or refrain from smoking for any study visits in this protocol.   
 Participants who exhibit elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ -9 ≥ 10) will be urged to follow -up with 
their primary HIV provider and/or clinical social worker regarding their  depression.  
In the 14 -day sleep diary window immediately after the Entry Visit (see section 5.2), a trained research 
assistant will call each participant to administer the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Sleep  Disorders -
Revised (SCISD -R; initial interview on pp. 1- 3 and the insomnia module p. 4) (95) . 
 
July 29, 2022  9 
  
3.4  Week 12 Visit  (70-120 days after Entry/Randomization Visit)  
 
The SHUTi intervention and the internet sleep education/hygiene  Active Control will be implemented 
between Entry/Randomization and Week 12. A UPT  will be performed for women of reproductive potential; if 
positive, study participation will end and no further study procedures will be performed at this visit. Otherwise, once again, medical/psychiatric records , current medications , and current behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_871791]. Weight  and vital signs will be measured and recorded. All participants will complete a 
questionnaire battery containing the following: standard questions assessing demographics, medical/psychiatric history, s leep mediation use , insomnia treatment satisfaction, and insomnia care received outside of the trial;  
ISI; PSQI ; DBAS -16; P HQ-9; SCL -20; GAD- 7; PROMIS
® Fatigue Short Form ; AUDIT; PEG -3; and SF -36. 
The questionnaire battery will also include validated scales assessing physical activity  level , tobacco use, illicit 
drug use, and medication adherence. The que stionnaire  battery  will be administered on a computer in private 
with availability of the study team to assist only when asked by [CONTACT_2299]. The participant may refuse to complete any of  the questionnaire  items . 
We will then obtain again whole blood samples for laboratory testing of the inflammation biomarkers of 
interest and for updated HIV -1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. We will also archive blood and samples for 
future testing if consent  for this is provided by [CONTACT_2299].  
 Participants who exhibit elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ -9 ≥ 10) will be urged to follow -up with 
their primary HIV provider and/or clinical social worker regarding their depression.   3.5  Week 24 Visit/Closeout  (150- 210 days after Entry/Randomization Visit)  
 At this  final /closeout  study visit, a UPT  will be performed for women of reproductive potential; if 
positive, study participation will end and no further study procedures will be performed at this visit. Otherwise, once again , medical/psychiatric records , current  medications , and current behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_871791]. Height, weight, and vital signs will be measured and recorded. All participants will complete a questionnaire battery containing the following: standard questions assessing demographics, medical/psychiatric history, s leep mediation use , insomnia treatment satisfaction, and insomnia care received outside of the trial; 
ISI; PSQI ; DBAS -16; P HQ-9; SCL -20; GAD- 7; PROMIS
® Fatigue Short Form ; AUDIT;  PEG -3; and SF -36. 
The questionnaire ba ttery will also include validated scales assessing physical activity  level , tobacco use, illicit 
drug use, and medication adherence. The questionnaire  battery  will be administered on a computer in private 
with availability of the study team to assist only when asked by [CONTACT_2299]. The participant may refuse to complete any of  the questionnaire  items . 
We will then again obtain whole blood samples for laboratory testing of the inflammation biomarkers of 
interest and for updated HIV -1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. We will also archive blood and samples for 
future testing if consented by [CONTACT_2299].  
Participants who exhibit elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ -9 ≥ 10) will be urged to follow -up with 
their primary HIV provider and/or clinical socia l worker regarding their depression. In addition, the study team 
will notify  the primary HIV provider that his/her patient has completed participation in our trial and if the 
participant still has clinically  significant insomnia  (ISI ≥  8). The study team w ill also provide a list of local 
mental health service s to the patients’ primary HIV  providers  or social workers.  After the procedures for this 
study visit have been performed, participation in this study will end, with no further active follow -up apart fr om 
notification of final study results.  3.6 Study Duration and Participant  Retention  
 
 
July 29, 2022  10 
 The maximum study pe riod for each participant  will be  between 24 and 30 weeks , accounting for the 42-
day period from Screening to the Entry Visit . To promote retention in the study, participants will be financially 
compensated at the Entry, Week 12, and Week 24 Visits.

5.0 STUDY TREATMENT S 
 
5.1 The Intervention Group: SHUTi . SHUT i is the empi[INVESTIGATOR_4260], inter net CBT -I created by  [CONTACT_871821] , [CONTACT_871843], that is fully accessible via tablets and smartphones. It uses a self -guided, fully 
automated, interactive, multimedia format to deliver six 45 -minute sessions, the structure and content of which 
mirror traditional face- to-face CBT -I (96, 97) . Session content includes sleep restrictio n, stimulus control, sleep 
hygiene, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention. The primary model of behavior change on which SHUTi is based is Social Cognitive Theory, the most widely used model of behavior change in the i nternet 
intervention literature (98). Each session has the same structure: objectives, sleep diary and homework review, new intervention material, homework assignment, and summary. Session content was created to be engaging and is based on learning theory and instructional design (99) . SHUTi is enhanced through a variety of 
interactive features, including personalized goal setting, graphical feedback based on inputted symptoms, animations and illustrations to enhance comprehens ion, quizzes to test user knowledge, patient vignettes, and 
video- based expert explanation. Across sessions, patients also receive tailored sleep recommendations and 
feedback based on the sleep diary data they enter into the program. SHUTi has been shown t o be acceptable, 
feasible, and effective in several RCTs published in high- impact journals  (87, 100- 103) with effect sizes 
comparable to face- to-face CBT -I (79) .  
 SHUTi was developed and studied in patients who were 18 years and older (100, 102) . The prescription 
digital therapeutic platform for chronic insomnia ma rketed as Somryst ™ utilizes SHUTi principles but carries 
an FDA approval only for those aged 22 and greater, as the FDA considered those under age 22 (e.g. ages 18-21) to be children and would thus require a separate pediatric indication using pediatric insomnia measures . As 
this study will use SHUTi (which is licensed for research purposes by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ritterband’s group for those 18 and older ), and not Somryst ™, we will include HIV -positive patients with insomnia who are 18 years or older to 
increase external g eneralizability and extend the study’s potential impact across the lifespan as per our NIH 
application . 
 To minimize treatment barriers , attrition, and subject burden, SHUTi  sessions will be delivered remotely 
at a location selected by [CONTACT_871822] e s/he can access a computer with internet, such as the participant ’s 
 
July 29, 2022  12 
 home, the participant ’s work, a family member’s/friend’s home, or a public library. We will loan study tablet 
computers  with d ata plans to patients without reliable internet access to maximize intervention update and 
decrease attrition.  [CONTACT_4341]’s laboratory and the Infectious Diseases Research C linic at Eskenazi Health 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871792] a participant pre fers in -person delivery.  
We will deliver SHUTi with support, as it increases the efficacy o f internet interventions (104- 106). 
Specifically, the Intervention RA, a clinical psychology PhD mentee of  [CONTACT_4341]’s , will track each 
participant’s progress through the SHUTi dashboard and will check -in with each participant every two weeks to 
address any questions or issues.  
 We will also tell patients that, if they choose to complete SHUTi session where others are present, these 
other people (e.g., family member or friend) may realize that they are completing a treatment for insomnia. It 
will be up to each patient to decide if the available remote locations provide sufficient privacy. Up to 6  sessions 
will be completed by [CONTACT_871823] 12 Study Visit at rate of a session every 1 -2 weeks . No physiologic or biologic assessments will be performed during these sessions. The 
participants need not be fasting for these sessions.  
  
Information is  collected by [CONTACT_871824], which the program 
requires to tailor interventions to each participant's particular sleep problem. Of note, participants in our trial will not enter any identifying information into the SHUTi program  other than the email address they  choose to 
use to receive messages (e.g., reminders) from the program . They will also enter information related to their 
current sleep problem (sleep diary, insomnia symptoms, and treatment goals) and will be identified by a unique participant  ID number and a unique pass word. The key linking participant names with their SHUTi login 
information will be kept in a separate secure and locked file cabinet. All data collected through SHUTi will be saved on password -protected computers and secure severs.  In addition, the SHUTi program’s data security and 
storage at the University of Virginia was reviewed by [CONTACT_871825] 7, 2021 (Request ID#: 00010559). Thus, the data entered into SHUTi is highly protected . 
 
5.2 The Active Control Group: Internet S leep E ducation/H ygiene , Symptom M onitoring, and Usual C are.  
 
In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], our comparator was usual care. However, in the proposed trial, we will use an active 
control comparator (107)  for two reasons. First, w e wish  to obtain precise effect size estimates for the next -step 
trial, and a  usual care comparator could overestimate efficacy. Of note, Irwin ’s RCT (21)  found mo derate -to-
large improvements in insomnia remission and CRP with CBT -I versus a sleep education/hygiene active 
control. Second, our  active control arm will help to ensure that the groups have similar expectancy of benefit.  
 The Active Control RA, another clinical psychology PhD mentee of  [CONTACT_4341]’s , will oversee and 
deliver the active control  procedures. First, the RA will give participants acces s to the internet sleep 
education/hygiene program, which was created by [CONTACT_21123], [CONTACT_871843], to serve as a standardized 
active control condition for SHUTi. This educational program was developed at the University of Virginia with funding from th e National Institutes of Health and is fully accessi ble via tablets and smartphones. This program 
provides static information about: insomnia symptoms; the impact, prevalence, and causes of insomnia; when to see a doctor; and basic lifestyle, environme ntal, and behavioral strategies to improve sleep  (i.e., sleep hygiene 
recommendations) . Of note, participants in our trial will not enter any identifying information into the internet 
sleep education/hygiene  program  other than the email address they  choose  to use to receive messages (e.g., 
reminders) from the program . The content for this program was informed based on a review of insomnia -
focused websites at the time of development. Second, just after giving participants access  the internet sleep 
education/hygiene program, the RA will email or mail a list of local  behavioral health services to patients and 
will encourage them to follow -up with their HIV provider. To engender expectancy of benefit, the RA will 
stress that our noti fications should prompt actions by [CONTACT_871826] e 
evidence -based. We will then notify the HIV provider , which will encourage the m to address their patient’s 
 
July 29, [ADDRESS_1217665] of local services. The sam e RA will also call each control participant  every 4 
weeks to assess insomnia symptoms (ISI) and will notify clinical staff to encourage additional care when 
indicated. Furthermore, the RA will encourage continued use of the sleep hygiene practices. Each control participant will receive usual primary care for insomnia , which in our local HIV clinics  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_871793] (CBT -I is not offered)  and use of  antihistamines  and trazodone (hypnotics and 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_871794]).  
Participants randomized to either the Intervention group or the Active Control group will complete sleep 
diaries based on consensus sleep diary questions (108)  that are incorporated into the online platforms for SHUTi 
and Active Cont rol for the 14 days immediately after the Entry visit and the 14 days immediately before the 
Week 12 and Week 24 visits.  
We will also assess treatment credibility/expectancy of benefit  (109)  (end of first SHUTi session or 
active control call) and insomni a treatment satisfaction with an item from our past trials (Week 12 Visit).  
Of note, t here will be no restrictions on the care that the participants can receive by [CONTACT_871827] , although we will assess changes in such  care during the trial . 
  
5.3 Prohibited Medications  
 
• Investigational agents  
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy  
• Systemic immunosuppressive medications  
• Systemic glucocorticoids (topi[INVESTIGATOR_14271]; inhaled/nasal steroids are allowed only if the participant is not also receiving HIV protease inhibitors)  
• Anabolic steroids (physiologic testosterone replacement therapy is not exclusionary)  
• Hepatitis C medications

 [IP_ADDRESS] Laboratories  obtained through routine clinical care  
  Laboratories obtained through routine clinical care before the Entry/Randomization visit will be 
abstracted and recorded onto CRFs. These include most recent hepatitis C antibody status (positive, nega tive),  
hepatitis C RNA level (HCV viral load), hemoglobin, glucose, albumin, creatinine, and estimated GFR (per 
CKD- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]). If available, t he most recent HIV -1 RNA level  obtained within 30 days of the positive ISI 
score meeting the insomnia inclusio n criterion  will also be recorded on CRFs.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Laboratories  
  An HIV -1 RNA level will be obtained at an in- person Screening visit if none are available through 
routine clinical care within 30 days of the positive ISI score meeting the insomnia inclusion criterion. This will be performed at the IUH Pathology Laboratory.  
 HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell counts  will be measured at the Entry, Week 12, and Week 24 study visits. 
These will be performed at the IUH Pathology Laboratory.  
 Whole blood [ THREE (3) 6.0 -mL, purple -top EDTA tubes ] will be drawn for the inflammatory 
biomarker measurements  at Entry, Week 12, and Week 24. These tubes are to be filled completely. These whole 
blood samples are not to be spun after collection and are to be kept at room temperature  and upright  pending 
transfer  to the Angio BioCore . The se 3 tubes for the Angio Bi oCore will be labeled “WB ABC”.  These will be 
given to the Angio BioCore laboratory (under [CONTACT_871844]’s supervision) for same day measurement of monocyt e fractions using standard flow cytometry procedures. The residual sample will be processed for 
plasma aliquots and stored. These aliquots will later be used for batch testing of hsCRP, IL -6, sCD14, and 
sCD163 in the Analyte Core of the Diabetes Center (under [CONTACT_871845]’s supervision) and for longer term archival for measurement of proteins and chemicals of future research interest.  
Computer labels will be generated and affixed to the appropriate specimen containers and will include 
the specimen number, partic ipant number, specimen date, specimen type , and aliquot number . Labels must be 
affixed prior to freezing the vials.   Urine pregnancy testing will be performed for women of reproductive potential at Entry, Week 12, and 
Week 24.   
 
 
July 29, 2022  18 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Questionnai res 
 
 At Entry, Week 12, and Week 24, participants will complete a questionnaire battery (see Appendix) 
containing the following: standard questions assessing demographics, medical/psychiatric history, s leep 
mediation use , insomnia treatment satisfaction, and insomnia care received outside of the trial; ISI; PSQI ; 
DBAS -16; P HQ-9; SCL -20; GAD- 7; PROMIS® Fatigue Short Form ; AUDIT; PEG -3; and SF -36. The 
questionnaire battery will also include validated scales assessing physical activity  level , tobacco use, illicit drug 
use, medication adherence and the probability of sleep apnea (STOP -BANG Questionnaire; Entry only) . The 
questionnaire  battery  will be administered on a computer in private with availability of the study team to assist 
only when asked by [CONTACT_2299].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1217671] this event in our ongoing studies in HIV -infected and HIV -
uninfected depressed patients (please see Appendix at end of this protocol  for the full Suicide Management 
Plan). If a participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself (i.e., responds 
with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or spontaneously repor ts suicidal ideation), the visit will be immediately 
stopped, and the research assistant will interview the participant to complete the Patient Suicidality Form (see Appendix). If the participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions or if the patient answers “yes” only to Question 3 (previous attempt) and the most recent attempt was ≥ 10 years ago, the visit will proceed as normal, and the completed Patient Suicidality Form will be given to the principal investigator.   If the participant answers “yes” to any of the three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1217672] 10 years), the research assistant will immediately contact [CONTACT_54852]. [CONTACT_4341] (a clinical psychologist) and [CONTACT_84137] (a physician) will re view the case as soon as possible, but no 
later than the same day, to determine the appropriate course of action (e.g., immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s primary care provider , primary HIV provider, clinical social worker , or care coordinator, consult with  clinicians 
at Midtown Community Mental Health Center  or with the psychiatrists assigned to the LifeCare clinic , and/or 
escort  the patient to the Crisis Intervention Unit at Eskenazi Health).  Additional authorities, including the 
police, may be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] i f immediate harm is of concern.  Participants may  be withdrawn from the study. 
 A direct correspondence by [CONTACT_871829]’s HIV 
primary provider notifying him/her of the situation (see below).   
 If an enrolled participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself 
during any telephone calls (e.g., a scheduling call or a call to the study team initiated by [CONTACT_2299]), the exact same procedures as outlined above will immediately be initiated. Please see the Appendix for the full 
Suicide Management Plan.  
Because it is unknown if insomnia therapy (or lack thereof) results in somatic adverse events in 
antiretroviral- treated HIV -infected patients, we wi ll also carefully document Grade 3 or 4 level toxicities 
defined using the Division of AIDS Table for Grading Adult Adverse Experiences . Clinical management 
decisions  and decisions to discontinue participants from the trial will be made by [CONTACT_585204] (s) in 
conjunction with the participant ’s primary caregiver; care plans and outcomes must be included in the source 
documentation.  
All s erious adverse events (SAEs) will be documented on CRFs  with unexpected SAEs forwarded to the 
IU IRB within 10 working days of the event and the remainder to be documented on the annual continuing 
review.  
  
 
July 29, 2022  19 
  
8.0 CRITERIA FOR  STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
 
• Request by [CONTACT_266329]  
• Request of the primary care provider if s/he believes the study is no longer in the best interest of the 
participant  
• If the participant  is found to be pregnant or begins breastfeeding during the course of this study  
• If the participant  develops a fever, need for systemic therapy for acute or serious illness, or hypotension 
after screening that precludes completion of the study visits within the allowed timeframe s  
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medication(s)  
• Clinical reasons believed life t hreatening by [CONTACT_099] 
• Participant , as judged by [CONTACT_473], to be at risk of failing to comply with the provisions of the 
study protocol as to cause harm to self  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1217673] our hypotheses, we will use intention- to-treat (ITT)  analysis of covariance models to test for 
treatment group differences in Week 24 levels of inflammation biomarkers adjusted for baseline levels. P -
values will be two -sided and considered significant at α=0.05. Adjustments for multiple comparisons will not be 
performed due to the relatively small sample size and exploratory nature of this phase II trial.  
In secondary/exploratory analysis, multivariable linear regression models will  be constructed to include 
treatment group and other potentially confounding baseline and time -updated variables that differ significantly 
between groups and which may account for differences in outcomes. Baseline characteristics that may be included in the models are demographics  (age, sex, race/ethnicity) , ISI scores, PHQ- 9 and SCL -20 scores, 
tobacco/adherence questionnaire results, ART drugs/regimens (including efavirenz, rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], and integrase inhibitors), insomnia medication use, comorbidities, CD4 cell counts, HIV -1 RNA levels , levels of the 
inflammation biomarkers, and nonprescription substance use . Time -varying characteristics that may be included 
are changes in ISI scores, questionnaire results, CD4 cell counts, ART drugs/regimens, and HIV -1 RNA levels.  
We will also perform ‘per protocol’ secondary analyses comparing the ISI
4-6 subgroup (defined as 
participants who completed ≥4 of the 6 SHUTi sessions)  vs. the active control group to determine if greater 
SHUTi engagement leads to greater differences in the endpoints of interest.  
We will also examine relationships between changes in questionnaire scor es, especially ISI scores, and 
the inflammatory endpoints using Pearson correlations.  
All of these models will be repeated for comparing 12- week ch anges in the endpoints in addition to the 
primary models for 24- week changes.  
 
9.2 Missing Data Approach  
 
Missing data mechanisms will be examined by [CONTACT_871830]. Multiple imputation (SAS proc mi and miana lyze) will be used if a substantial amount (>10%) of 
missing data exist. If differential missing patterns are observed, sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the consequences of potential missing mechanisms.

group to examine these factors as potential moderators of intervention effects: age, sex , inflammation 
bioma rkers  levels , ISI scores, PHQ -9 and SCL -20 scores , use of sleep aids /medications , and nonprescription 
substance use . Given that the proposed trial is not powered to detect such interactions, specific models will also 
be run separately for males and females to assess whether there are clinically important differences in the 
treatment group- outcome relationships between sexes.  
 
9.4 Mediation Analyses  
  Preliminary mediation analyses to assess for  intervention -related decreases in ISI scores , behavioral 
changes, and HIV virologic rebound (either singly or in combination) to explain reductions in the inflammation /monocyte activation  endpoints will be performed.  
 9.[ADDRESS_1217675] sizes of SHUTi on 
inflammation/monocyte activation endpoints in support of a future, definitive trial. As such, the proposed sample size is based on the enrollment time period and the  funding allowance of the R21 mechanism, not for 
definitive superiority testing.  We will enroll 50 participants with the expectation that 40 (20 in each arm) will 
complete the [ADDRESS_1217676] deviations and correlations between baseline a nd week 24 for 
hsCRP (this trial’s primary endpoint) from our previously published depression trial, we have 80% power (α=0.05) to detect mean differences between study groups of 3.41 mg/L. This detectable difference is clinically meaningful , as it is similar to that found to be predictive of CVD events and overall mortality in the SMART 
trial (66, 110) .  
 For the primary and secondary endpoints, the following table demonstrates the effect sizes that can be 
observed between study groups (N=20 in each arm) , assuming similar variances and correlations as observed in 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_871795]. Of note, the detectable difference in IL -6 is also clinically 
meaningful , given that differences of 1.3- 2.2 pg/mL w ere associated with greater risks of CVD and mortality in 
the SMART trial (66, 110) .

  Our group has access to ~3000 HIV -positive outpatients engaged consistently in care within the Indiana 
University Health system (Eskenazi Health with 1200; IU Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] 1800). As part of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we found that ~30% of the virologicall y-suppressed PWH in our HIV clinics have ISI scores ≥11. Thus, 
there are ~900 patients eligible for recruitment. Based on review of our clinic population characteristics, we estimate ~800 will fulfill the other eligibility criteria.   9.6 Criteria for Stop pi[INVESTIGATOR_753259].

out of 6 SHUTi sessions. 
 
9.11 Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analysis will be performed.  
 
9.12 Subgroup Analysis  
 
Our analyses will be repeated comparing the Active Control group with the SHUTi intervention group 
who complete ≥ 4 of the 6 planned treatment sessions (the SHUTi 4-6 subgroup) . 
 
9.13 Data Management  
 9.13.1 Data Management Systems.  
 
IU REDCap  will be used to capture demographics, vital signs, medications, medical/psychologic 
history, diagnoses, interview, survey, and EHR data. The following IU REDCap databases will be created: 
Recruitment and Screening , SHUTi Intervention Delivery, Active Cont rol Delivery , Screening Visit, Entry 
Visit, Week 12 Visit, and Week 24 Visit. Data will be exported from IU REDCap in SAS format. Assay data 
from the T ranslation Core Analyte Laboratory (hsCRP, IL -6, sCD14, sCD163) and the Angio BioCore 
(CD14+CD16+ interme diate monocytes) will be converted from Excel to SAS format and merged with the IU 
REDCap data.  
 9.13.2 Methods of Data Cleaning  
Data cleaning procedures will assess for out -of-range values, outliers, normality, and very low frequency 
classes for each variable using SAS statistical software.  Frequencies will be examined to identify out -of-range 
(i.e., impossible) values. Identified out -of-range values will be checked against the source data and corrected 
(any data entry, coding, or computational errors will be fixed and/or  assays will be rerun , as appropriate).  Z 
 
July 29, 2022  22 
 scores (≤ -3.3 or ≥ 3.3) for all continuous variables will be computed to identify outliers. Identified outliers will 
be checked against the source data and corrected if due to data entry errors. If not due to data entry errors, these 
values will be noted, retained in primary analyses, and may be altered or removed in sensiti vity analyses. Skew 
(≤ -3 or ≥ 3) and kurtosis (≤ - 10 or ≥ 10) values will be examined to assess normality of continuous variables. If 
the normality assumption is not met, variable transformations to normalize distributions and/or distribution- free 
nonpara metric tests for the primary analyses will be considered.   
 9.13.[ADDRESS_1217678] data (ty pe of medical visit and diagnostic codes) to be stored in an Excel file. [CONTACT_84137] 
will report the total number of emergency department visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871796]. If evidence of treatment group imbalance emerges, further investigation by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gupta will be initiated (e.g., examining reasons for the visits), and the results will be reported to the DSMB for their consideration.  
 
9.13.4 Methods for Monitoring the Quality and Consistency of Data Collection 
 
We will use our IU REDCap assessment databases to ensure the collection of high- quality data in a 
consistent fashion over time. These databases will serve as both the operations manual and the data collection instrument for study contacts. Specifically, each database will include s tep-by-step instructions (e.g., from the 
scheduling call to the closing of a visit) with a box to be checked by [CONTACT_871831]. All interview questions and questionnaire items will be embedded in the data bases, along with radio 
buttons, checklists, drop- down menus, or open fields to capture participant responses. There will be open fields 
to capture height, weight, and vital signs. I nstructions for the electronic health record chart reviews and the 
corresp onding data fields will also be embedded to capture relevant data (e.g., concomitant medications and 
insomnia care received outside the trial).  Data quality (e.g., % missingness) will be assessed every [ADDRESS_1217679]. Gupta’s 
DSMB report.   9.13.5 Policies and Methods for Ensuring Blinding of Study Results  
 
To ensure unbiased results, all outcomes assessors will be blinded to treatment group assignment, and all 
patients will be blinded to study hypotheses until the proposed trial is complete. Drs. Gupta and Stewart and the study personnel involved in treatment delivery (SHUTi vs. sleep education/hygiene) will not be blinded by [CONTACT_100827].  [CONTACT_32830] and [CONTACT_871846]  will have the master randomization list but will not share it with the blinded  
co-investigators  and laboratory personnel performing the endpoint inflammation assays (Drs. Considine and 
Pollok). At the Entry Visit, randomization will occur at the end of the session after all data collection for that visit is complete.   9.13.[ADDRESS_1217680] 
completed or will complete the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) courses in Human Subjects Research and Good Clinical Practice and will make every effort to ensure confidentiality. All electronic and hard copy data will be identified using only the unique participant identific ation number assigned when each 
patient is enrolled (participant identifying information will not be included). All electronic data will be saved on password- protected and encrypted computers and secure servers, and all hard copy data will be stored in sec ure 
and locked file cabinets. The key linking participant names with the participant identification numbers will be 
 
July 29, [ADDRESS_1217681]. Stewart’s Cardiovascular Beha vioral Medicine Laboratory. No identifying information will be entered into 
SHUTi. Instead, participants will log on using their participant identification number and a password they create. Finally, participants will be instructed to complete study calls and SHUTi sessions in private rooms or areas in their homes or other locations they choose.   
10.0 HUMAN PARTICIPANT S RESEAR CH AND PROTECTION  
 10.1 General Considerations/ Investigator Training  
 
The Human Participants Research outlined in this proposal meets the definition of a Phase II clinical 
trial for the purpose of identifying biological and physiological mechanisms of human disease (not for identifying the superiority of one agent over the other). Although the NIH does not require a formal Data and 
Safety Monitoring Boar d, we will still employ one with an  independent monitor as described below. This trial 
will be posted on ClinicalTrials.gov and updated regularly as needed for protocol update s and results. All 
Indiana University personnel involved with this application have successfully completed the training and examination involved with the  Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative  Course.  
 10.2 Risks to the Participant s 
 10.2.1  Human Participant s Involvement and Characteristics  
 
• A total of [ADDRESS_1217682] 18 years of age (no upper age limit), have documented HIV infection, have a screening HIV -1 RNA level <75 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL while on ART for at least six 
months, and have insomnia disorder per the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -[ADDRESS_1217683] another sleep disorder diagnosis (e.g. sleep apnea); have a schedule requiring a bedtime earlier than 8:00pm or later than 2: 00am or 
arising time earlier than 4:00am or later than 10:00am (thus preventing adoption of SHUTi);  
have any other pro- inflammatory condition (e.g. autoimmune diseases); malignancy 
requiring treatment within 6 months of screening; are receiving systemic da ily anti-
inflammatories; have a history of bipolar or psychotic disorder; or are currently pregnant or breastfeeding.  
o Potential participants will be recruited from the Ryan White HIV outpatient clinics of Eskenazi Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871797].  
 10.2.2 Sources of Materials  
 
• All data for this study will be obtained only after verbal consent is provided during the Screening 
process and after written, informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_871832] , clinical trial portion of the study . Existing medical records will be reviewed for 
demographics, medical diagnoses, and medications. Blood samples will be obtained for testing of HIV-[ADDRESS_1217684]. 
Questionnaires to assess insomnia, depression, tobacco and alcohol use, anxiety, medication adherence, physical activity , and fatigue  will also be  implemented.  
• Results from pertinent medical records and procedures performed for these studies, as outlined above, will be recorded on the human participants involved in the projects in this application. 
• Data will be stored in a password -protected comput erized database via REDCap that will include 
only the participants’ study identification number (names and other identifiable information will not be included). Therefore, the SID# will be the only link to the participant. Only the principal investigators, co -investigators, and research personnel who will directly obtain the necessary data 
will have access to the participant identities. All data obtained for this study will be obtained only after written, informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_20908].  
• Records will be reviewed manually. Urine specimens will be obtained via standard clean- catch 
technique. Blood specimens will be obtained via peripheral venipuncture. Questionnaires will be completed in private settings. These data will be collected solely f or the purpose of the proposed 
research projects.  
 
10.2.3 Potential Risks  
 
• There are minimal risks to the participants enrolled in the proposed research. The first is the potential 
loss of participant confidentiality. The second consists of the risks assoc iated with blood drawing/needle 
sticks, which include pain, bruising, infection, and phlebitis. The amounts of blood to be drawn at 
screening and at each main study visit are 5 cc (one teaspoon) and 18 cc ( 1-2 tablespoons ), respectively. 
The total amount of blood to be obtained over the 24 week study period would be approximately 60 cc (4 tablespoons) , which is well within the accepted standards for blood donation over a 6 month period. 
There are no known risks related to the implementation of the SHUTi cognitive behavioral therapy program in the Intervention Group or of the sleep education/hygiene program in the Active Control/Comparator group. Participants may also feel unease in completing the questionnaires.  
• The principal alternative to these procedures would be not to participate in the research.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1217685] Risks  
 10.3.1 Recruitment and Informed Consent  
 
• In brief, recruitment will only begin once the Indiana University Institutional Review Board has approved this study. All participants will be recruited from the outpatient Ryan White HIV care clinics at Eskenazi Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871798]. Self -referrals from other 
venues will also be considered. The EMR filter functions (EPIC for Eskenazi Health, Cerner for Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will be used to identify potentially eligible participants from the clinic databases. We wil l then ask each patient’s primary HIV caregiver for permission to approach their patient for 
recruitment into the trial. If permission is granted, our dedicated trial recruiters will approach these potentially eligible patients either in person or by [CONTACT_871833] (ISI). For those with an ISI score ≥[ADDRESS_1217686] all concerns addressed. If the 
participant wishes to pursue screening, then written informed consent will be obtained (and a copy given to the participant). All consent forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet.  
 
July 29, [ADDRESS_1217687] Risk  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality . To minimize the risk to participant confidentiality, patient identifiers will be removed 
once his or her data is abstracted and recorded, and only the random study identification number (generated when consent is provided) will be used. All hardcopy study data will be kept in a secured and locked file cabinet. All electronic data will be kept in a password -protected computer database. The only link between 
patient identifiers and the randomized study identification number will be kept in separate files. Identifiers will never be used in the analysis or presentation of study results.  
 Information collected from the participant  for this research may be used for future research studies or 
shared with other researchers fo r future research. If this happens, information which could identify the 
participant  will be removed before any information are shared. Since identifying information will be removed, 
we cannot ask for your additional consent.  
   
[IP_ADDRESS] Questionnaires . Participants may feel uneasy or discomfort in completing some of the questionnaires 
(e.g., those assessing depressive symptoms). To m inimize this risk, questionnaires will be completed in private 
settings , with any questions regarding completion of the ques tionnaires addressed by [CONTACT_871834].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood draws . The risks of blood drawing will be minimized by [CONTACT_473410]. The amount of blood that will be drawn falls well within safety standards for blood donation. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suicidal ideation  and management . Although not an inherent risk of the study intervention or study 
procedures, participants may  have depression as determined through completion of the PHQ -[ADDRESS_1217688] this event in our previous studies in HIV -uninfected depressed patients (please see Appendix at end of this protocol  for the full Suicide 
Management Plan ). If a participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/her self 
(i.e., responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ -9 Item #9 or spontaneously reports suicidal ideation), the visit will be 
immediately stopped, and the research assistant will interview the participant to complete the Patient Suicidality Form (see Appendix). I f the participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions or if the patient answers 
“yes” only to Question 3 (previous attempt) and the most recent attempt was ≥ 10 years ago, the visit will proceed as normal, and the completed Patient Suicidality Form  will be given to the principal investigator.  
 If the participant answers “yes” to any of the three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1217689] 10 years), the research assistant will immediately contact [CONTACT_54852]. [CONTACT_4341] (a clinical psychologist) and [CONTACT_84137] (a physician) will review the case as soon as possible, but no later than the same day, to determine the appropriate course of action (e.g., immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s primary care provider , primary HIV provider, clinical social worker , or care coordinator , consult with clinicians 
at Midtown Community Mental Health Center, and/or escort  the patient to the Crisis Intervention Unit at 
Eskenazi Health). Additional authorities, including the police , may be contact[CONTACT_753273]. Participants may  be withdrawn from the study. 
 A letter, both an email and a hard copy version, will also be sent to the potential participant’s primary 
provider notifying him/her of the situation (see be low).   
 If an enrolled participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself 
during any telephone calls (e.g., a scheduling call or a call to the study team initiated by [CONTACT_2299]), the exact same process as outlined  above will be initiated.  Please see the Appendix for the full Suicide 
Management Plan.  
 
 
July 29, 2022  26 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event financial management , grading, and reporting. In the event of an adverse event, 
necessary medical and professional intervention will be provided immediately and billed to the participant’s 
medical insurance (if available). If the participant does not have insurance, care will be provided via the indigent care program at Eskenazi Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Standard procedures for reporting deviations from protocols will be followed; serious adverse events that meet the Indiana University IRB prompt reporting requirements will be reported within 10 business  days .  All adverse events will be graded using The Division of AIDS Table 
for Grading Adult Adverse Experiences is located at: 
http://roc.s -3.com/members/download/adulttox.pdf . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Data and  Safety Monitoring. Upon discussion with the NIH/National Institutes of Mental Health, this 
trial is considered a minimal risk study that does not require independent monitoring. As such, only Level 1 monitoring by [CONTACT_22888]- PIs (Drs. Gupta and Stewart) is required. The co- PIs u nder supervision of the IU IRB will 
meet every 6 months to review and ensure participant safety; monitor recruitment, accrual, randomization, retention, treatment delivery and fidelity; and review data collection and quality; suicidal ideation protection protocol triggers; any adverse events; any protocol deviations; and any IRB amendments. The IU IRB and NIH will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_871799].  
 
10.4  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Pa rticipants and Others  
 
• Potential benefits to the participants include an evaluation of their insomnia, immunology, and pro-inflammatory status. They may also derive short -term benefits from the SHUTi and sleep 
education/hygiene treatment programs, although this is not guaranteed. Participants will also be provided with the final trial results via their HIV providers.  Finally, the participants may also benefit from knowing that their participation will accrue knowledge that could benefit other HIV -positive 
patients.  
• Although there are no guaranteed clinical benefits from those who are randomized to treatment with SHUTi, this program appeared safe in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_871800] -
negative patients in published trials . Therefore, t he ancillary benefits to the participants in the proposed 
trial significantly outweigh the minimal risks in this study. Moreover, the proposed research may lead to other prevention and therapeutic studies that would demonstrate how to reduce inflammation i n PLW, 
which consequently may reduce future serious non -AIDS events in the HIV -positive population. This 
would benefit society directly by [CONTACT_473412].  
 10.5 Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 
• The knowledge that will be gained from this study will determine the relationships between HIV, insomnia, insomnia treatment, and inflammation. This would potentially impact the clinical care of HIV -
positive patients at risk for serious non- AIDS events. Furthermore, prevention and therapeutic s trategies 
for these highly prevalent diseases can then be formulated, thereby [CONTACT_871835], mortality, and 
cost to the patients and society in general. 
• The risks to the participants are considered minimal. Even if the trial results are negative, the ensuing knowledge will add substantially to our understanding on the mechanisms underlying inflammation in HIV-positive patients with insomnia. Therefore, the importance of the knowledge gained outweighs the 
risks to the participants.  
 10.[ADDRESS_1217690] developed a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan to ensure the safety of 
participants and to monitor participant recruitment, accrual, randomization, and retention; treatment delivery 
and fidelity; and data collection and qualit y.  
 
10.6.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Monitoring.   
We will systematically identify potential adverse events (AEs): (a) by [CONTACT_871836] 6 months for all emergen cy department visits, outpatient visits, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871801] (b) by [CONTACT_4316] a self -report 
questionnaire assessing for the occurrence of any potential adverse events since the last study visit/call . Any 
potential AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_871837]. We will fully investigate, rate, and prepare a Case Report Form for those events that are plausibly related to insomnia, insomnia treatment, suicidal ideation, or any study proce dure. For all other captured events (emergency department visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871802]), we will provide frequency counts for the SHUTi Intervention and Active Control study arm s. We will fully investigate these events only if 
there is evidence of group imbalance. It is worth noting that that: (a) we are delivering safe and established insomnia interventions, (b) we are not delivering any new or experimental interventions or rest ricting usual 
care, and (c) all study procedures are noninvasive (except for the blood draw) and standard.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Rating and Reporting  
All events plausibly related to insomnia, insomnia treatment, suicidal ideation, or any study procedur e 
will be promptly rated using the anticipation, severity, and attribution scales below. These ratings will be included in the Case Report Form for the adverse event and signed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gupta or [CONTACT_4341].  
 
Anticipation  
1. Anticipated  
2. Unanticipated  
 
Severity  
1. Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated  
2. Moderate: Interference with normal daily activities  
3. Severe: Inability to perform normal daily activities  4. Life -Threatening: Immediate risk of death from the reactio n as it occurred  
 
Attribution  
1. Definite: Adverse event clearly related to study involvement  
2. Probable: Adverse event likely related to study involvement  
3. Possible: Adverse event may be related to study involvement  
4. Unlikely: Adverse event doubtfull y related to study involvement  
5. Unrelated: Adverse event clearly not related to study involvement  
 All AEs that meet the IU IRB prompt reporting requirements (unanticipated; definitely, probably, or possibly related to study involvement; and suggest that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or re cognized) will be immediately reported to the IU IRB  and NIH. All severe or 
life-threatening AEs will be immediately reviewed by [CONTACT_22888] -PIs and reported to the IU IRB and NIH . All other 
 
July 29, 2022  28 
 AEs will be reported to these entities at the time of continuing revie w. A summary of AE data (e.g., frequency, 
types, and corrective actions) will be provided to the IU IRB and NIH at the time of continuing review.  
 
10.6.[ADDRESS_1217691] (DSMB)  
 
For this phase II trial, upon discussion with the NIH/National Institutes of Mental Health, this trial is 
considered a minimal risk study that does not require independent monitoring. As such, only Level 1 monitoring by [CONTACT_22888]- PIs (Drs. Gupta and Stewart) is required. Every six months, a written report will be pr epared  
describing study updates; participant recruitment, accrual, randomization, and retention; treatment delivery and fidelity; data collection and quality; suicidal ideation protection protocol triggers; any adverse events; any protocol deviations; and any IRB amendments. The IU IRB and NIH will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_871803].   10.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 There are no exclusion criteria based on sex, racial category, or ethnicity in the proposed studies. Based 
on our previous cumulative experience and the general HIV -positive population cared for at the study sites at 
the Indiana University Health Medical Center (Eskenazi Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], IU Health Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), it is anticipated that approxim ately 25% of the study participants will be women.  
It is also anticipated that approximately 50% and 5% of the study participants will be black and 
Hispanic, respectively. American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Island ers 
are not expected to be represented in the proposed study population due to extremely low representation of these groups within the HIV outpatient clinics of Eskenazi Health and Indiana University Health Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871804] l. 
 
10.8 Inclusion of Children and Inclusion across the Lifespan  
 
 Participants under the age of 18 are excluded from the proposed studies as inflammation and monocyte 
activation markers may be affected by [CONTACT_871838]. In addition SHUTi has not been fully evaluated yet in those under 18 years. However, there will be no upper age exclusion to ensure that older participants that are now more representative of the aging HIV population in the [LOCATION_002] are included in this trial.

Appendix: Suicide Management Plan 
 
Suicide management plan s very similar to the one described below ha ve previously been approved by [CONTACT_753285] w ere successfully implemented in prior depression trials conducted by [CONTACT_763937]  
(e.g., IRB #’s [PHONE_18063] and1411802537) .  Those suicide management plans were constructed with input 
from Eskenazi Midtown Community Mental Health Center leadership , who concluded that the  plans provide  a 
high level of protection while minimizing disruptio n to usual clinical activities.  In the present trial, w e will 
assess suicidal ideation with the PHQ -9 at Entry, Week 12, and Week 24, and we are prepared to appropriately 
handle the situation should one of the enrolled patients exhibit suicidal ideation.    
(a) In-Person Study Visits  
Suicidal ideation will be assessed using Item #9 of the PHQ -9 at Entry, Week 12, and Week 24. If a participant 
reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself (i.e., responds with a 1, 2, or 3 to PHQ- 9 Item #9 or spontaneously reports suicidal ideation) during any of the Study Visits , the visit will be 
immediately stopped, and the study coordinator s running these visits will interview the participant to complete 
the Patient Suicidality Form (see below). If the potential participant answers “no” to the clarifying question, the 
visit will proceed as normal. If the potential participant answers “yes” to the clarifying questi on, the participant 
will be asked the three suicide questions.  The study coordinators have  been trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stewart, a clinical psychologist, in conducting the interview to 
comple te the Patient Suicidality Form and in following this protocol . [CONTACT_871847] rt will also serve as the  primary 
supervisor to these study coordinators when it comes to their tasks related to this s uicide m anagement plan. In 
[CONTACT_4341]’s completed depression trials ( IRB #’s [PHONE_18063] and1411802537) , he has tr ained  various 
research assistants to effectively conduct this interview and provide a high degree of protection to patients.  The graduate student research assistants are doctoral students enrolled full -time in IUPUI’s clinical psychology 
Ph.D. program, which is accredited by [CONTACT_753287]. Stewart is a core member. The research assistants have completed graduate coursework in psychological assessment, psychological interventions, psychopathology, and ethics  and have acquired supervised cl inical experience in 
local healthcare settings . The graduate student research assistants have also been trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stewart in 
conducting the interview to comple te the Patient Suicidality Form and in following this protocol. [CONTACT_4341] is 
also the prim ary supervisor of graduate student research assistants.  
 It is worth noting that  neither the study coordinators nor the graduate student research assistants will be making 
any decisions regarding how to handle a situation. Instead, they will collect information by [CONTACT_17801] a highly structured, 4- question interview (Patient Suicidality Form, found below ) and will follow the 
straightforward, step -by-step protocol  described in the next paragraph. They will be instructed to call [CONTACT_871848] if they are unsure about a participant’s response to any of the  three  questions. 
 If the participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions or if the patient answers “yes” only to Question 3 (previous attempt) and the most recent attempt was ≥ [ADDRESS_1217698]. Stewart.   
 If the participant answers “yes” to any of the three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1217699] 10 years) , the study coordinators  or the graduate student research assistant will immediately stop 
the visit, will contact [CONTACT_6283]. Stewart and /or Gupta , and will stay with the participant until a decision is made . If 
clinically indicated (e.g., the situation is an emergency), a graduate student research assistant and/ or [CONTACT_4341] 
will go to the visit location ( Infectious Diseases Research Clinic or ICRC) to assist the study coordinators . 
 
July 29, 2022  38 
  
Drs. Stewart and/or Gupta will review all cases screening positive for suicidal ideation immediately to determine the appropriate course of action – e.g., interview the patient to obtain further information, 
immediately contact [CONTACT_102]’s HIV provider or clinical social worker  to involve them in the decision- making 
process , consult with clinicians at the Eskenazi Health Midtown Community Mental Health Center  or with the 
associated psychiatrist to LifeCare clinic to aid in the decision- making process , escort the patient to the 
Eskenazi Health Crisis Intervention  Unit  (‘warm handoff’), and/or contact [CONTACT_871841] . Either [CONTACT_4341] or [CONTACT_84137] will also call the participant’s 
HIV provider notif ying him/her of the situation if the provider was not involved in the decision- making process. 
Regardless of the exact course of action, the study team will ensure that the participant is connected to the 
appropriate existing clinical services. If the patient’s HIV provider  no longer believes that the patie nt is 
appropriate for this trial  following this  situation , the patient will be withdrawn from the trial.   
 Of note, because patients exhibiting active suicidal ideation  are not eligible for this trial, we expect that it will 
be a rare occurrence that an enrolled patient will screen positive for suicidal ideation . 
 
(b) Study Telephone Contacts  
If a participant reports having thoughts of being better off dead or of hurting him/herself spontaneously during a 
study call  (e.g., a scheduling call ), the study coordinator  or a graduate student research assistant will interview 
the participant to complete the Patient Suicidality Form (found below) .  
 If the potential participant answers “no” to all three suicide questions, the call will proceed as planned a nd the 
completed Patient Suicidality Form will be given to [CONTACT_4341].   If the participant answers “yes” to any of the 
three questions (for Question #[ADDRESS_1217700] 10 years), the study coordinator  or 
a graduate student res earch assistant will immediately contact [CONTACT_6283]. Stewart and /or Gupta. Drs. Stewart and/or  
Gupta will review the case immediately to determine the appropriate course of action – e.g., interview the patient to obtain further information, immediately contact [CONTACT_3433] e patient’s HIV provider or clinical social worker  to 
involve them in the decision- making process , consult with clinicians at the Eskenazi Health Midtown 
Community Mental Health Center  or with the associated psychiatrist with the LifeCare clinic  to aid in the 
decision -making process , escort the patient to the Eskenazi Health Crisis Intervention Unit, and/or contact [CONTACT_871842]. If a participant prematurely 
terminates a call after reporting  suicidal ideation, the study coordinator  or a graduate student research assistant 
will immediately contact [CONTACT_6283]. Stewart and /or Gupta. Once again, Drs. Stewart and /or Gupta will review the case 
immediately to determine the a ppropriate course of action. Eit her [CONTACT_4341] or [CONTACT_84137] will also call the 
participant’s HIV provider notif ying him/her of the situation if the provider was not involved in the decision-
making process. Regardless of the exact course of action, the study team will ensure that the par ticipant is 
connected to the appropriate existing clinical services.  If the patient’s HIV provider  no longer believes that the 
patient is appropriate for this trial following a situation, the patient will be withdrawn from the trial .   
 It should be noted that the informed consent form for this  trial contain s a section describing the steps that will 
be taken if an enrolled participant reports suicidal ideation on a questionnaire or spontaneously.

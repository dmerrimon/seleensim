Study Title  A Multi -Center , Open- Label Trial I nvestigating Behavior Related 
to ella® Use in a Simulated OTC Environment  (LIBRella)  
Phase Phase IV  
Background and 
Rationale  ella® (ulipristal acetate) is proposed for a prescription to over -the-
counter ( Rx-to-OTC ) switch . This actual use trial ( AUT) will be 
conducted to demonstrate appropriate consumer behavior when 
using the product in the absence of a physician or other learned 
intermediary . This study will be conducted to obtain 
measurement s of consumer behaviors related to the actual use of 
the product, in particular the compliance with key communication 
messages presented in the Drug Fac ts Label ( DFL). 
Objective and 
Endpoints  The objective of this study is to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed OTC labeling to guide appropriate consumer behavior  
by [CONTACT_471827] -specified endpoints . The determination of the 
following primary endpoint s and other measures is based on the 
potential  clinical consequences  of a consumer failing  to heed 
each key  label instruction and the concerns the [LOCATION_002] 
Food and Drug Administration (US FDA ) has raised with regard to 
the potential for misuse of the product in an OTC setting. 
Endpoints are designated either as Actual Use endpoints or Self -
Selection endpoints.  
Primary Endpoint s 
A. Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances among user 
population taken within 120 hours (5 days) of most recent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_471796].  
B. Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances among user 
population in which  no more than one tablet  was taken . 
C. Self-Selection:  Proportion of female selector s who are not 
pregnant at the time of selection decision.  
Secondary Endpoints  
D. Self-Selection:  Proportion of female selector s who are not 
breastfeeding at the time of  selection decision.  
E. Self-Selection:  Proportion of self -selection population who 
make a correct selection decision.  
F. Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances among user 
population in which  hormonal birth control  (HBC) is not 
taken  for 5 days after taking ella®. 
G. Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances among user 
population associated with use of hormonal contraceptives 
in the same cycle after taking ella® in which  subject  
report s using a condom (or other barrier method) every 
time they have  sex until their next menstrual period.  
H. Actual Use:  Proportion of user population who do not use 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604749] more than once in the same menstrual 
cycle . 
I. Self-Selection/Actual Use:  Proportion of self -selection  
population taking one of the “ask a doctor or pharmacist 
before use” products who do not select, who select but do 
not use or who report contact[CONTACT_30697] a healthcare provider or 
pharmacist .  
Other Measures  
J. Actual Use:  Proportion of user population who used  a 
HBC method sometime during the previous  two months . 
K. Actual Use:  Proportion of user population who use any 
EC on more than one occasion within the study period.  
L. Actual Use:  Proportion of user population who report 
becoming pregnant within the study period.  
Study Design  This is an observational open- label, multicenter, 6- week  study 
designed to mimic an OTC -like environment in which subjects will 
use ella® after making a self-selection and purchase decision 
about the product  based only on their reading of the DFL and 
other information on the package . The study will  increase 
understanding regarding  how subjects will use the medication in 
an OTC -like environment.  
Number of 
Subject s A total of approximately 950 subjects will be allowed to purchase 
the study medication. Assuming that about 80% of those who 
purchase will both use the study medication and participate in at 
least one follow  up telephone call , that will yield an actual use 
population among which to evaluate the primary endpoints of 76 0 
subjects . In order to allow for  a subgroup of adolescent users, 
adult purchasers will be constrained  to no more than 775, 
allowing for an adolescent subgroup of approximately 175 (or 
more, should a higher proportion naturally occur).  Among 
adolescents, enrollment will be further broken down to include 
approximately 50 purchasers  under the age of 15 and 
approximately 125 purchasers  ages 15- 17. 
Methods  The nature of the indication (emergency contraception, EC ) 
makes recruitment for the trial challenging . By [CONTACT_108] a woman 
does not know in advance that she will need EC , and when she 
does need it  (i.e., after she has had unprotected sex) , she needs 
to take it very quickly . Therefore, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_471797] ( the 
approach typi[INVESTIGATOR_471798]) is unlikely to be effective in this 
study .  
Subjects will be recruited at the point of OTC -like sale in women’s 
health clinics and in retail pharmacy study sites . Sites will be 
chosen which currently sell EC  in an OTC or OTC -like setting and 
which have enough EC sales to meet recruitment goals . 
Approximately 35 sites will be used , comp osed of approximately

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 8 of 67 25 women’s health clinics and [ADDRESS_604750] s come to a site 
looking to purchase  EC, they will be offered the opportunity to 
participate in the study . Potential sub jects will be directed  to study 
staff for a face -to-face interview  and screened for initial study 
inclusion criteria . 
Subjects who meet the initial screening inclusion criteria for the 
study will be given an (empty) ella® package and will be allowed 
as much time as they need to review the information on the 
outside of the entire package . Subjects will be asked to make a 
selection decision regarding  whether the product is appropriate 
for them to use or not .  Reasons for sel ection and deselection will 
be recorded.  Those that select the product will then be told the 
cost of the investigational product and will be asked if they would 
like to purchase it for their own use. Reasons for any non-
purchase and purchase decisions will be recorded.  
Following the  purchase decision, subjects  will provide 
demographic information and limited  medical  history . The Rapid 
Estimate of Adult  Literacy  in Medicine  (REALM)1 or Rapid 
Estimate of Adolescent  Literacy  in Medicine (REALM -Teen)[ADDRESS_604751] and told they  may return to the site  at any time to 
resupply . Subjects will not be allowed to  purchase more than 3 
one-dose packages at a time or more than  9 one-dose packages 
during the study  period (althoug h this will not be communicated to 
the subjects unless  they attempt to purchase more than that). 
While any  request for more will be denied, the request  will be 
recorded . 
Subsequent contact [CONTACT_471828] (interviewers)  at a central research 
site. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_471829] -2 (Day 14 with 
an allowable window  of ±3 days) and at Week -6 (Day 42±4  days)  
to gather information on if, how and when the subject took the 
product, any adverse events  (AEs),  concomitant medications, and 
other actions  the subject  may have taken related to the use of the 
product . Results of the E nd-of-Study pregnancy test will be 
reported by [CONTACT_471830].  
Once all steps of the final  telephone interview  are completed,  the 
subject  will be instructed to return leftover study  medication, if 
any, and empty packaging  to PEGUS  and will exit the study.

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 9 of 67 Statistical 
Analysis A summary  of the  disposition of subjects (including  responders,  
self-selection population, purchasers and  users ) and reasons 
for exclusion from these populations will be provided. 
Demographic  characteristics,  medical history  and other 
background information will be summarized for the responder, 
self-selection, purchaser,  and user  populations.  
Frequencies  and percentages  will be presented for categorical 
data, mean,  standard deviation (SD);  median, and range will be 
presented for numerical data.  
Frequencies, percentages  and 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals ( CIs) will be calculated for the primary  and secondary  
endpoints using the exact method. For the primary endpoints, it 
will be concluded that the established target threshold is 
reached if the lower  limit of the  CI of the point estimate  is equal 
to or exceeds  the value of the pre -determined threshold.   
Endpoints  and demographics will be presented for subgroups of 
interest, with subjects  dichotomized on the corresponding 
variables, which include (but are not necessarily limited to) literacy , gender , age (adolescent vs. adult women), and history of 
hormonal birth control use.  
Several of the endpoints are based on dosing instance, rather 
than by [CONTACT_1130], as subjects have the potential to take more than 
one dose over the course of the study.  Correctness of selection 
or behavior can only be evaluated at the t ime of use, rather than 
at the time of purchase.  However, for each of those endpoints , a 
secondary analysis by [CONTACT_471831].  
A more detailed description of planned data analysis procedures 
will be found in the Statistical Analysis  Plan (SAP) which will be 
approved and signed before the database is locked.  
Study Duration  The duration of this study is expected to be aro und 6 months 
(from first subject enrolled in the study until last subject last visit), 
with subject recruitment proposed to start mid -Q2 [ADDRESS_604752]

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 18 of 67 1 INTRODUCTION  
ella® (ulipristal acetate) is propos ed for  a prescription to over -the-counter ( Rx-to-OTC ) 
switch . This study is designed to assess whether  consumers will use the product in a 
manner consistent with the labeling . A Drug Facts L abel (DFL) for the nonprescription 
version of ella® has been drafted and evaluated in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_471799]  
(LCS) . This protocol describes the next stage of the development  program , a pi[INVESTIGATOR_471800]-
selection (SS) and actual use trial  (AUT), which will provide measures of how and when 
consumers select to use and use the product in an OTC -like setting . 
1.1 Indication  
The proposed  labeled “P urpose”  for nonprescription ulipristal acetate 30 mg is 
“Emergency contraceptive. ” The proposed labeled “ Use” for nonprescription ulipristal 
acetate 30 mg is “for women to reduce chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex (if a 
contraceptive failed or if you did not use birth control) .” 
1.[ADDRESS_604765] and use ella® in a 
manner consistent with the labeling .  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Objective 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the behavior of subjects in an OTC -like setting 
when selecting and using ella®. 
2.2 Endpoints  
The determination of primary  and secondary  endpoints has been made based on the 
potential  clinical consequences  of a consumer failing  to heed each key label instruction  
and the expressed concerns of the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (US 
FDA) about the potential for misuse of the product in an OTC setting. The rationale 
behind selection and prioritization of endpoints is summarized below in Section  2.3. The 
appropriateness  of behaviors will be assessed by  [CONTACT_471832] 9.3. 
 
 Primary Endpoints

2.3 Rationale for Designation of Study Endpoints 
The determination of endpoints and designation as primary  or secondary endpoints  has 
been made based on the potential  clinical consequences  of a consumer failing  to heed 
each key  label instruction  and FDA’s concerns regarding potential product misuse. Each 
endpoint is listed in Table 1 below, with the DFL messages relevant to the endpoint, 
followed by [CONTACT_471833] a primary  or secondary 
endpoint . Note that the “Other Measures ” listed above in Section 2.2.3  are not 
endpoints . Rather, they are descriptive only, and will be used to help characterize the 
study population in the analysis.

Primary   
A Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing 
instances among user population taken 
within 120 hours (5 days) of most recent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_471796].  Directions: Take one tablet as soon as 
possible and no later than 120 hours (5 
days) after unprotected sex.  
   
 Rationale:   The Sponsor  proposes to test this message as a primary endpoint 
because it communicates directions for effective use of ella®, and the limited time -
window for its effective use. Use of ella® after [ADDRESS_604766]’s 
efficacy, altho ugh it is not expected to introduce any drug -related risks . This

unprotected intercourse than recommended in the product label.  
   
B Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing 
instances among user population in 
which no more than one tablet was 
taken . Directions: Do not take more than one 
tablet.  
   
 Rationale :  The Sponsor  proposes to test this message as a primary endpoint in 
the context of FDA’s recommendation to demonstrate in an AUT whether consumers misuse ella
® with intake of more than the recommended dose.  This is 
proposed as a primary endpoint  despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] , while taking one tablet is 
essential to effectiveness of the product, dose -finding studies using up to 200 mg 
of ulipristal acetate  (UPA) (more than 6 times the intended 30 mg dose) 
demonstrated no safety concerns (HRA2914- 503), suggesting  it is likely that 
taking more than the recommended dose is likely to impose little or no additional 
risk in women.  
   
C Self-Selection:  Proportion of female  
selector s who are not pregnant at the 
time of selection decision.  Warnings: Do not use if you are already 
pregnant (because it will not work)  
   
 Rationale:  The Sponsor  proposes to test this message as a primary endpoint as it 
would allow the study to confirm that consumers do not select or take ella® if they 
are already pregnant, although the available safety data are reassuring for 
pregnant women exposed to ella®. 
   
   
Secondary   
D Self-Selection:  Proportion of female 
selector s who are not breastfeeding  at 
the time of  selection decision . Warnings: Do not use if you are 
breastfeeding 
   
 Rationale:   While it has  been shown that UPA and its metabolite are both excreted 
in breast milk over the first [ADDRESS_604767] taken UPA 30mg.   
 
Because breastfeeding is not a contraindication for use of ella® in the prescription 
setting (though it is not recommended because of a lack of clinical data) , this has 
been  designated  as a secondary endpoint in this AUT.  
   
E Self-Selection:  Proportion of self -
selection population who make a correct • Do not use if you are already 
pregnant

• Do not use more than once in the

• Do not use if you are breastfeeding 
• Use: for women to reduce chance 
of pregnancy after unprotected sex  
• Allergy alert: Do not use if you have 
ever had an allergic reaction to any 
of the ingredients  
   
 Rationale : The main goal of the AUT is to assess actual use of ella®. Given that 
potential clinical consequence of incorrect selection is unlikely to be serious,  the 
Sponsor  proposes to test correct self -selection of potential consumers as a 
secondary endpoint.  
   
F Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing 
instances among user population in which  HBC is not taken  for 5 days after 
taking ella
®. Directions: After taking this product; 
users of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch or vaginal ring after use of this product: 
Do not use birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch or 
vaginal ring for [ADDRESS_604768] and your 
birth control to work.  
   
 Rationale : The concern about starting HBC within 5 days after taking ella® relates 
to a theoretical decrease in the efficacy of ella® resulting from an interaction 
between ella® and progestins in HBC products. In reality it is uncertain to what 
extent the efficacy of ella® is affected or, indeed whether it is affected at all .  
The recommendation to delay starting HBC after taking ella® stems from a single 
study by [CONTACT_471834] [ZIP_CODE]. The study was designed to explore a 
possible interaction between ella® and HBC, when HBC was started immediately 
after taking ella®. It was a small study of just 49 women who were not using HBC 
prior to using ella®, and who took ella® when an ovarian follicle had reached at 
least 14 mm in diameter and so were soon to ovulate; that is, at the point in the 
menstrual cycle when ovulation was  already most likely to occur. The following 
day, half of the women started an HBC (a progestin- only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], POP) while the 
others started a placebo. The key finding was that 44% of women who started 
HBC ovulated within 5 days of taking ella® while only 10% of women in the 
placebo group ovulated in that time frame. Notably , over 50% of women who 
started HBC after ella® did not ovulate and so were not at risk of pregnancy. 
Nevertheless, the theoretical concern was that starting HBC immediately after 
ella® use might reduce the efficacy of ella®. 
This was a small pharmacodynamic study of just [ADDRESS_604769] importantly , the study was not designed with pregna ncy as

Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-001    
Final v3.1  5May2017   
PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 22 of 67 an endpoint. Nevertheless, the Spon sor took a conservative and cautious position 
in changing the prescription ella® label to reflect this theoretical concern, hence 
the advice to wait 5 days before starting or restarting HBC. However, because of 
all the limitations of the Brache study, the medical community cannot agree 
whether or not this recommendation is important. In Europe,  this instruction has 
not been added to the ella® label and the failure rate of ella® remains low.  
The situation pertaining to use of ella® followed by [CONTACT_471835]. In the Brache study , the women had not taken HBC prior to using ella® 
and they took ella® in the presence of a large pre- ovulatory follicle, i.e., on the 
verge of ovulating. In the OTC situation, the recommendation to delay starting 
HBC applies only to women who have already been taking HBC prior to using 
ella® (since to acquire a new supply of HBC will require a prescription). Thus  these 
ella® users are likely to be women who are seeking EC  because they have missed 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. Unlike the women in the Brache study, these women are at very low risk of pregnancy. HBC use suppresses ovarian activity and it takes time for the ovary to recover when the pi[INVESTIGATOR_471801]. In a Cochrane review of the effec t of missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_471802], Zapata et al
4 reviewed a number of pharmacodynamic studies in which 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_471803]. They concluded that even after missing up to 14 days of HBC (pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) ovulation is uncommon. In 207 women who missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_471804] 8 and 11 days , there were no ovulations and in women who did ovulate 
(usually following missed pi[INVESTIGATOR_471805]) the cycle was not normal, follicles were small, progesterone levels were low and cervical mucus hostile.  
So, in conclusion,  if a woman buys ella® over the counter and has a supply of 
HBC, which she wants to restart after ella® use, should she fail to follow the 
instructions to delay restarting HBC, she is highly unlikely to get pregnant.  
Accordingly, the Sponsor  proposes that the percentage of women who delay 
re/start of the HBC for 5 days after ella® intake be a secondary endpoint in this 
study.  
   
G Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing 
instances among user population 
associated with use of hormonal 
contraceptives in the same cycle after 
taking ella® in which subject reports 
using a condom (or other barrier 
method) every time they have sex until 
their next menstrual period.  Directions: After taking this product; 
users of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch or 
vaginal ring after use of this product: 
Use condoms  (or another barrier 
method) every time you have sex until 
your next menstrual period.  
   
 Rationale:  This secondary endpoint is intended to address the hypothetical risk of 
pregnancy resulting from unprotected intercourse after use of ella® due to the 
potential risk of delayed ovulation in users of hormonal contraceptives. However, as described above in Secondary Endpoint F, risk of pregnancy for these women 
is minimal, and therefore this endpoint is  also designated a secondary endpoint in 
this AUT.  While women who start HBC with a [ADDRESS_604770] of unprotected sex in that short interval

Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-001    
Final v3.1  5May2017   
PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 23 of 67 by [CONTACT_471836], once again , this was a very cautious position since the chance 
of pregnancy in that interval, even without use of a condom, is extremely low. 
Furthermore, all women (not just those starting/restar ting HBC after ella® use) 
having unprotected sex after using any method of EC (i.e., ella® or EC containing 
LNG including Plan B) and before their next menses should ideally use condoms 
as back up to reduce the risk of pregnancy, but labeling to that effec t is not 
present on other EC products in the OTC marketplace.  
   
H Actual Use:  Proportion of user 
population who use the study product 
more than once in the same menstrual 
cycle.  Directions: Do not use more than once 
in the same menstrual cycle.  
   
 Rationale : While data has been collected that demonstrates that using ella® more 
than once during a menstrual cycle does not pose any safety risk, the direction not 
to use ella® more than once in a menstrual cycle is still on the prescribing 
information. For this reason, as well as feedback from the FDA, this will therefore 
be tested as a secondary endpoint.  
   
I Self-Selection/Actual Use:  Proportion of 
self-selection  population taking one of 
the “ask a doctor or pharmacist before 
use” products who do not select, who 
select but do not use or who report 
contact[CONTACT_30697] a healthcare provider or 
pharmacist  Consumer Information Leaflet:   
 Talk to a healthcare professional  
or yo ur pharmacist before taking ella
® 
if you are taking certain drugs to treat:  
• seizures (barbiturates, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], felbamate, 
oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052])  
• tuberculosis (rifampin)  
• fungal infections (griseofulvin)  
• HIV or AIDS  
• pulmonary hypertension (bosentan)  
• St. John’s Wort (or any herbal 
products containing hypericum 
perforatum)  
   
 Rationale : In vitro  studies indicate that ella® is predominantly metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4, suggesting that CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the plasma 
concentration of ella® if administered concomitantly , as it was shown with 
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513].  However, no clinical  studies have demonstrated a potential increased 
risk of pregnancy among women treated with CYP3A4 inducers and there is no 
data indicating that increasing the dose of UPA may have an impact on a 
theoretical risk of pregnancy .  Additionally, similar drug-drug interactions exist for 
levonorgestrel  and CYP3A4 inducers , the only other readily available option for 
emergency contraception.  
Unintended pregnancy is particularly undesirable in women taking many of these 
drugs since they are used to treat serious c onditions many of which pose 
significant risks to the fetus.  ella® is not contraindicated in these circumstances, 
rather the potential concern is that emergency contraception (including 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-001    
Final v3.1  5May2017   
PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 24 of 67 levonorgestrel) may be less effective if used with concomitant medica tion.  An 
emergency contraceptive which may  be slightly less effective is arguably 
preferable to no emergency contraception for this particular group of women.  
Given that the clinical impact of concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer wit h ella® 
use is unclear,  that there are no recommendations precluding the use of ella® 
under these circumstances, and that the only other available option for oral EC 
has similar interactions (despi[INVESTIGATOR_471806]), 
this endpoint is designated a s secondary.  
 
[ADDRESS_604771] s will make a self-selection  
and purchase  decision about ella® based only on their reading of the outside o f the 
package including the DFL. Qualified s ubjects who choose to purchase the study 
medication will do so , then leave the study site and use the product  on their own. The 
study is designed to assess if, when and how subjects use the medication in an  OTC -like 
environment.  
It is important to note that subject characteristics and how they might be related to 
behaviors directed by [CONTACT_471837], enrollment, or during the 
6-week study period will not be discussed directly with subjects until the end of study  
interview.  
3.1 Naturalistic Design  
This trial is a multi- center trial conducted in a naturalistic environment . Study 
characteristics and procedures were designed to make it as natural istic as possible . 
Some of the key naturalistic elements include the following:  
• There are minimal study exclusionary criteria imposed on subjects , making this 
trial nearly an all -comers study to mimic the likely OTC population.  
• The study will be conducted in  women’s health clinics and pharmacies, 
representing typi[INVESTIGATOR_471807] -like setting . 
• The proposed OTC packaging  and labeling is the only product information 
provided to subject s during the study . Subject s will only review the outer 
packaging at the initial visit . Study staff will not provide any additional information 
or encouragement regarding product selection  at that visit. Staff will not answer 
subject  questions but will redirect them to the outer pac kage.  
• After purchas ing the study product, subject s will take the package with them 
when they leave the site; th e package will include the outer packaging and , inside 
the package, the consumer information leaflet (CIL) and study medication.

Final v3.1  5May2017   
PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 25 of 67 3.2 Study Sites  
Approximately 25 women’s health clinics and [ADDRESS_604772] following approval , and which represent t he 
places women currently go to seek EC  in an OTC -like setting . The women’s health 
clinics sell currently available OTC EC in an OTC -like manner without the requirement to 
see a clinician. These clinics typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a window or a front desk area where women 
purchase EC by [CONTACT_471838] -clinical staff , in a manner similar to consumers 
purchasing an OTC product in a pharmacy.  
Study  sites will be selected to provide geographic and demographic diversity . They will 
be selected from approximately eight  geographic regions in the US . Each site has a 
private office or a suitable semi -private area where the study will be carried out privately 
and without distraction. The study area will also have all of the necessary computer 
equipment and a high -speed Internet connection to accommodate the electronic data 
capture system (EDC).  
It is expected that subjects enrolled through health centers are likely to be younger on 
average and have higher prevalence of low literacy than subjects who might respond to 
recruitm ent for a more  typi[INVESTIGATOR_471808].  
 Site Training and Procedural Integrity  
PEGUS Research will select sites and train the site staff  after approval by [CONTACT_471839] ( IRB). All study staff will receive study -specific 
training. All training will be documented and retained in the study files.  
3.[ADDRESS_604773]  selection will be 
self-driven by [CONTACT_471840].  In general, that will mean intercepting women who are self -
pay or who are willing to be self -pay for the purposes of the study, and who present for 
EC only. Consumers who are purchasing EC for someone else’s use will  not be invited 
to participate, as they cannot give consent on behalf of the actual user.  
Given that adolescents are an important subgroup in the study,  adult subject s will be 
constrained to  no more than 775 subjects , allowing for  an adolescent subgroup number 
of approximately 175. Further, the group of older adolescents (age 15 and older) will be 
constrained to 125, to allow for approximately [ADDRESS_604774] subjects how to use 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604775] ; they will simply acknowledge the need for EC and extend the 
invitation to participate.  
While it is unusual in an actual use trial to allow for active recruitment on the part of 
clinicians, the FDA -requested goals for ad olescent enrollment are very likely to make 
supplemental recruitment measures necessary , particularly for those under age 15. 
Should recruitment via clinicians for adolescent subjects be necessary, i n order to 
minimize the potential for bias, clinicians wi ll be trained not to counsel potential 
adolescent subjects about the use of EC in general, nor will they give specific counseling 
about the study product.  This supplemental  mechanism of recruitment , if used because 
needed to meet adolescent recruitment goals , is unlikely to have any impact on the 
primary endpoints of the study. The usual concern about active clinician recruitment is 
that it may bias self -selection. There are three factors to consider regarding this 
theoretical concern . First, consumers’ abi lity to self -select for emergency contraception 
as a whole in the OTC market has already been established. Second, self -selection for 
this product is very similar to already available OTC emergency contraceptives. Third, 
any potential bias affecting self -selection would be in the negative direction as subjects 
may indeed select the product mistakenly thinking that the clinician has recommended it, 
when, in f act, the product is not right for them.  In order to estimate any impact of clinician 
referral on self -selection endpoints, data will be presented separately for adolescent 
subjects recruited in this manner.  
 Inclusion Criteria : Self -Selection Phase  
In order  to enroll a sample as representative as possible of the likely OTC consumer, the 
study inclusion criteria are defined as broadly as it is feasible. Subjects must meet the 
following initial screening inclusion criteria  in order to begin the enrollment interview :  
1. Able to read, speak and understand English  
2. Can see well enough to read information on the label  
3. Another member of the respondent’s family has not participated in this study  
4. Consumer or someone else in the household does not work for a market 
research or advertising company, public relations firm, news organization, 
pharmacy or pharmaceutical company, medicine manufacturer, as a healthcare 
professional, or as part of a health care practice, managed care or health 
insurance company, trained or worked as a healthcare professional or market 
research professional (eliminated for reasons of confidentiality and increased 
awareness of medicines  and their labels)  
5. Has not participated in a health- related market research or product label study in 
the past [ADDRESS_604776] 12 months  
7. Has never participated in a study about EC  
8. Seeking the use of emergency contraception  
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604777] meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for  
enrollment into the use phase of the study:  
• Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent form indicating that 
the subject (or a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects 
of the study.  
• Willing and able to comply with the initial visit and planned phone calls and other 
study procedures.  
 Exclusion Criteria: Use Phase 
All subjects who agree to participate at the site will be asked to make a selection 
decision. Subjects  presenting with any  of the following will not be included in the use 
phase of the  study  (i.e., will not be allowed to purchase and use study  medication):  
1. Unwilling to purchase study medication.  
2. Unwilling to provide written informed consent.  
3. Unwilling or unable to provide contact [CONTACT_3031].  
4. Unwilling to state that the  product is for their own use and no one else’s.  
5. Pregnant , by [CONTACT_6270] -report or by a urine pregnancy test . 
6. Male.  
7. Known allergy to ulipristal acetate  or inactive ingredients . 
8. Currently breastfeeding.  
9. Premenarchal (have not experienced a first menstrual cycle).  
Subject eligibility will be reviewed and documented by [CONTACT_21438]/her 
designee before subjects are allowed to purchase and begin the use phase of the study . 
 Recruitment Methods  
The nature of the indication (emergency contraception) makes recruitment for the trial 
challenging. By [CONTACT_108] a woman does not know in advance that she will need EC, and 
when she does need it  (because she has had unprotected sex) , she needs it quickly . 
Therefore, a passive advertising campaign aimed at consumers interested in the indication (the approach typi[INVESTIGATOR_471798])  is unlikely to be effective for this study . 
Similarly, it would be inappropriate to make a woman who has had unprotected sex and 
is in need of EC as soon as possible wait for a scheduled appointment at the study site 
and potentially delay her taking the EC  that she needs  to take within a limited timeframe . 
This is particularly true because an approved OTC option is available to h er outside the 
study.  
Therefore, s ubjects will be actively recruited at the point of OTC -like sale in women’s 
health clinics and in the retail pharmacy study sites . Sites which currently sell EC  in an 
OTC or OTC -like setting and which have enough EC sales to meet recruitment goals  will 
be chosen. They will also be chosen to ensure geographic and demographic diversity , 
and to be as representative of literacy in the general population as possible.  When a 
subject presents asking for EC, they will be offered the opportunity to participate in the 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604778] then will be routed to the study staff for the face-to-face enrollment interview. 
See S ection 3.3 for more information.  
3.4 Randomization  
There is no randomization in this study.  
3.5 Data Collection  
Data will be collected in structured one- on-one interviews using a standardized 
questionnaire either in -person ( at the initial enrollment  visit) or by [CONTACT_756] ( in two 
follow -up interviews ). The interview s will be administered by a trained interviewer usi ng 
an internet -based Electronic Data Capture ( EDC)  application in which the interviewer will 
read the introductory scripts and the questions from the screen and will enter the 
responses directly into the study database. As a precaution, a paper version of the 
questionnaire will be available at each site should there be a loss of internet connection 
while using the EDC system  during the course of an interview . This will allow the 
interviewer to complete the enrollment process  for that subject ; interviews will not be 
started on a paper DCI. Data from any interviews completed on paper will be entered 
into the EDC system as soon as possible after a ccess is restored , and the paper 
questionnaires will be retained as source documents in the study files . 
The questionnaires  will include primarily open- ended questions . Question types will 
include direct questions and follow -up questions for clarification. No multiple -choice 
questions will be used. To facilitate the accurate capture of responses, open- ended 
questions wi ll have pre- coded answer alternatives . It is important to note that these 
response alternatives will not be read to the subject s, nor will subject s be able to see 
them on the screen . Where close- ended questions are used (e.g., yes /no, or ok /not ok), 
subject s will be asked to explain their answers so behavior  can be adequately assessed. 
When interviewers must type in open- ended question responses, they will capture short 
responses verbatim, and will accurately summarize longer responses.  
During the self-selection interview  at the initial visit , the ella® outer package including 
DFL will remain in front of the subject  and the subject  will be informed they can refer to 
the label at any time. However, the subject  will neither be encouraged nor discouraged 
from referring to the package in response to any specific question.  
All data will be collected via standardized, predesigned questionnaires in a one- on-one 
setting either in person or by [CONTACT_756] . For this study, no daily diary will be used. In the 
context of an AUT, a daily diary has the potential to influence subject behavior, making it much less naturalistic . In the case of a daily or frequent use medication, the advantages 
of a diary for the purposes of measuring the key endpoints may outweigh those

Subjects who enter the use phase will also be provided with a n administrative study 
information card (to include subject number , the central telephone number for any 
inquiries  and direction to call to report any  changes in health [AEs] experienced during 
the study ). The administrative study inform ation card will serve as a memory  tool for 
subjects, and will not be returned to PEGUS. Subjects will also receive a self-
administered  urine  pregnancy test to use at the end of the study and a pre- paid envelope 
to mail back unused study product or empty packaging.

All subjects enrolled in the us e phase  of this open- label study  will be given the 
opportunity  to purchase and take 30 mg of ulipristal acetate . 
4.2 Breaking the Blind  
Not applicable  to this study.  
4.3 Drug Supplies  
 Formulation and Packaging  
Tablets  for oral administration contain 30 mg ulipristal acetate and the following inactive  
ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydr ate, magnesium stearate, and 
povidone.  
ella® is available  as a [ADDRESS_604782] with a 
single tablet, constitut ing one dose . 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604783] (IP) based on their understanding of the directions on the 
outer packaging including D FL and inside the  product packaging (in the CIL). 
Subjects will be allowed to purchase the study  product at the study  site. Subjects will not 
be allowed to purchase  more  than 9 single -count  packages during the entire study  
period. They  will be allowed to purchase  up to 3 packages at a time (on any one 
calendar  day) during their first visit to the site and may return to the study site at any 
time to purchase additional medication,  up to a total of 9 packages , during the following 
6 weeks . These purchase limits will  not be disclosed to subjects unless they try to 
purchase more than 3 packages in a day  or more than 9 packages over the course of 
the study . Any such requests that exceed the purchase limits will be recorded.  
It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_471809], in order  to allow for the observation and 
measurement of overuse /misuse  of the product , should it occur. In this case, as there is 
no true “typi[INVESTIGATOR_44785]” for EC  because the product is used under unusual circumstances 
(in instances of unprotected sex) , purchase limits were chosen to allow for reasonable 
behavior on the part of subjects,  even if beyond the label directions,  without allowing for 
larger scale misuse. While the expectation is that the vast majority of subjects will purchase a single package of the IP, it would be reasonable for subjects  to purchase 
additional doses for advance provision. The daily limit was set at three to acc ount for 
this. Again, while the expectation is that very few subjects will return for resupply, in order to observe overuse or misuse  should it occur, repurchase will be allowed. Indeed, 
given FDA’s expressed concern about the potential for misuse  of this product , in 
previous interactions FDA agreed with the planned purchase limits as these limits  would 
allow the AUT to estimate the likelihood o f potential misuse when the product is 
available OTC.  
 Drug Storage and Accountability  
The Investigator will ensure  that the IP  is stored under recommended  storage conditions 
at the site and in accordance with the drug label  (store at controlled room  temperature 
20°C  to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]; see [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia [USP]) . 
The IP must be stored as indicated on th e package. Deviations from the storage  
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the 
monitor by [CONTACT_30107] . Deviations outside of the range of 20°C  to 25°C [68°F to 77°F] , but 
between 15°C and 30°C [ 59°F and 86°F ], will be documented and reported to the 
Sponsor by [CONTACT_471841]. If a deviation is identified 
outside of the range 15°C to 30°C [ 59°F to 86°F ], the deviation must be reported upon 
discovery and the IP must  be quarantined and not used until the Sponsor provides 
documentation of permission to use the IP. The Investigator must maintain adequate 
records documenting the receipt, use, loss,  or other disposition of the IP (s). 
At the end of the trial, subjects will be asked to return  any unused study  medication and 
empty packaging . Subjects will be provided with a pre -paid, pre- addressed [LOCATION_002] 
Postal Service envelope to send any unused study medication and empty packaging to 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604784].  Any such medication error will be reported to the HRA  pharmacovigilance (PV) 
department . If applicable,  any associate d adverse event(s) ( AE(s) ) will be documented 
via the mechanism for spontaneous AE reports . 
 Compliance  
There is no protocol -directed use of the study  product  and subjects will use the product 
at their own discretion based on their understanding of  the DFL and other material  on or 
in the package.  The subjects will report on their use of the product in the  two follow -up 
telephone interview(s).  
4.5 Concomitant Medication(s)  
The IP packaging (the CIL)  will contain information about  the use of other  medications  
when taking ella®. Subjects will be queried at enrollment about medications that they are 
currently  taking.  During the two study telephone interviews, subjects will be queried about 
any new medications that they have begun taking  since  the start of the study.  
4.6 Rescue/Escape/Salvage Therapy  
Not applicable for this study . 
4.[ADDRESS_604785] s who spontaneously present to one of the  study site s seeking EC in an

trained to do the enrollment procedures.  
5.2 Study Period  
 Enrollment Visit , Self -Selection/ Purchase Decision  
At the enrollment /self-selection  visit (constituting Study Day 1) , which takes places at the 
women’s health clinic or pharmacy,  initial inclusion criteria will be reviewed and potential  
subjects will be shown the ella® package and given as much time as needed to review  the 
information on the outer package. After reviewing  the outer  package,  they will be asked 
whether the product is okay or not okay for them to use and if they want to purchase the 
product for their own use. Reasons for selection/non -selection and purchase/non-
purchase will be recorded . 
 After Purchase Decision and Before Use Phase 
The purpose of this study  is to see how the subject  complies  with the labeled  directions; 
therefore,  the date of the use of study medication is determined by [CONTACT_423] . Study Day 
[ADDRESS_604786]  information (for the purposes  of 
conducting telephone follow -up interviews)  and information regarding any medications 
they are current ly using.  Subjects  who cho ose to will then purchase the IP and site study 
staff will complete the electronic product accountability  form. While it is expected that 
most subjects will purchase a single package of ella®, subjects will be allowed  to 
purchase up to 3 boxes in any one  day, and will be allowed to return to the study  site at 
any time during the u se phase to purchase additional medication. Subjects will not be 
allowed to purchase more than 3 single dose packages in a single day , or more than 9 
single -dose packages during the study  period although this  will not be communicated to 
the subjects unless they attempt to purchase more than that . Any requests for purchase 
more than the limits will be recorded.  
Subjects  will also be informed that study and End-of-Study (EOS)  phone interviews will 
be conducted at Week 2/Day 14 (with  an allowable window of ± 3 days)  and at Week 
6/Day 42 (±4 days) . Subjects who have purchased the product will be dispensed the 
product  to use how and when they see fit . 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604787] with the subjects will be limited to:  
1. Dispensing additional IP  with no questions asked or answered or directions given 
about the use of the IP  by [CONTACT_5984].  
2. Appropriately documenting the IP  dispensed.  
3. Assisting any subject presenting self -reported AEs by [CONTACT_471843].  
 Telephone Interviews  
The two scheduled phone interviews  will be conducted by [CONTACT_471844] 
(usually  nurses) to collect information regarding AEs  and concomitant medications.  
During the 6 weeks of the study,  subjects  will be contact[CONTACT_348238]  14 (with an  
allowable window of ± 3 days) and 42  (±4 days)  to answer phone interview  questions  and 
provide information on AEs and concomitant medication (and, in the end of study  
interview, about pregnancy test results) . 
In addition, several non -leading quest ions will  be asked about behavior at the two phone 
interviews . Information will be asked for during both phone interviews in a masked 
manner to avoid influencing future behavior (e.g., “Besides  taking the medication, is there  
anything else  you have done to prevent pregnancy since we last spoke?”).  
Subjects will be compensated for their time and effort to enroll and participate in the study 
at designated intervals during the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Week [ADDRESS_604788] . Because subjects in this study will be invited to participate after  independently 
present ing to the clinic or the pharmacy seeking  EC (and not in response to advertising), it 
is expected that most subjects will be purchasing  EC for immediate use (because they 
have very recently had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_471796]), rather than solely  for advanced 
provision. The interview at  [ADDRESS_604789] information about  when she took ella® in relation to her  enrollment 
visit (and in relation to their most recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_471796])  and measure other 
behaviors in the period immediately surrounding taking the product . Timing of this 
interview is expected to be long  enough after enrollment to allow for capturing of use 
within or  outside of the 5- day window and resumption or starting of hormonal 
contraception use in the 5 or more days after ella® intake, but also to be soon enough that 
recall should not be problematic . Information about AEs  and changes to concomitant 
medications  will also be collected.

about behaviors related to EC use outside of the immediate period after use, as well as 
responses to a missed period.  Information about AEs and changes to concomitant 
medications  will also be collected.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  End-of-Study Intervie w 
In most cases, the E OS interview will take place in conjunction with the 6-week telephone 
call together with the week [ADDRESS_604791] regarding the use of other forms of 
contraceptio n, including other uses of EC  (if any) within the study period, and th e timing 
of such use. Subjects will also be asked about possible pregnancy , and will be asked to 
report the results of their EOS pregnancy test . This interview allows for direct questions 
about the rationale behind any behaviors that are not consistent with the DFL and CIL , 
witho ut concern about biasing the subject's subsequent behavior . 
5.[ADDRESS_604792]  Withdrawal  (Early Termination)  
An EOS interview  will be conducted with any subject who discontinues or withdraws 
consent prior to Week 6,  unless the subject withdraws  consent  for disclosure  of future 
information. This interview will attempt  to collect  the EOS information and the reasons for 
the subject’s early  termination . If the subject withdraws from the study between days 1 
and 17 (day 14 +3), the clinical inter viewer will attempt to complete the Week [ADDRESS_604793] withdraws between days 
17 and 46 (day 42+ 4), the clinical interviewer will attempt to complete the W eek [ADDRESS_604794] participation may be terminated by [CONTACT_471845]:  
• Significant protocol  violation;  
• AEs, including SAEs;  
• Pregnancy;  
• Physician decision;  
• Subject’s request ; 
• At the discretion of the Investigator or designee if s/he feels that study 
discontinuation is necessary to protect the subject, or that there are 
unmanageable factors that will interfere significantly with the study procedures 
and/or the interpretation of results.  
Any such subjects will be asked to return any unused study medication and empty 
packaging and will be precluded from purchasing additional study medication, but ea rlier 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604795], or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Inves tigator  or Sponsor  (or Sponsor  
designee) for safety or  behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with 
the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site.  
If a subject refuses contact [CONTACT_471846] -up calls , any effort s made to contact  [CONTACT_471847]. In any circumstance, every effort will be made to document  
subject  outcome,  if possible . The investigator  will inquire  about  the reason  for withdrawal, 
request the subject  to return all unused IP(s) and empty packaging , request the subject to 
participate in a final telephone interview , if applicable, and follow up with the subject 
regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs).  
If the subject withdraws from the study,  and al so withdraws consent for disclosure of 
future information, no further evaluations will  be performed, and no additional data will be 
collected . The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.  
A subject may be declared lost to follow -up if, during the study,  the available contact  
[CONTACT_471848] . Every 
attempt will be made to contact [CONTACT_471849] -up subjects, including  three phone call 
attempts and a [LOCATION_002] Postal Service ( USPS ) letter . Subjects whose status is 
withdrawn, lost to follow -up, withdrawal due to an AE or withdrawal from the study for 
other reasons will be recorded in the case report form ( CRF). 
If a subject wishes to discontinue his or her  participation in the study, the  
Investigator/interviewer  will document  the reason for withdrawal,  ask the EOS questions  
where  possible  and follow -up with the subject  regarding any new or unresolved AEs and 
collect or make arrang ements to collect all IP provided to the subject . Data collected  up to 
the point  of withdrawal  will be retained and used  as appropriate in the data analysis.

performed, the Investigator  will document the reason for this and any corrective and 
preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered 
to as soon as possible.  
The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion. All data will be 
collected using an Electronic Data Capture Data Collection Instrument ( DCI). 
6.1 Screening Assessment  
Subjects wi ll be s creened  during the initial visit to determine those individuals who will be 
included or excluded from the trial.  
6.2 Enrollment  Interview  
Subjects will be shown the ella® outer package and allowed to make a decision about 
whethe r the product is appropriate for them to use, and whether to purchase ella® for their 
own use. Subsequent questions will be asked to gather limited medical and medication 
history as it pertains to use of the product.  
6.3 Reading Level Assessment  
The REALM1 (for adults) or the REALM -Teen2 (for adolescents) test will be used to 
measure reading grade level and will be the measure of literacy used for this study . The 
REALM score corresponds to four grade -equivalent reading levels as shown in T able 2 
below, while the REALM -Teen score corresponds to 5 grade -equivalent reading levels as 
shown in Table 3 below . A REALM score of 60 or less (a reading level of 8th grade or 
lower) defines the low literacy subgroup among adult subject s. 
The REALM -Teen test does not have a 9th grade reading level cutoff, so a cutoff score of 
60 or lower will be used to define the low literacy cohort for the adolescent  group as well 
(which is the midpoint of the 8th - 9th grade -equivalent reading level) . This allows for a 
somewhat more conservative requirement to be classified as low literacy among the 
adolescent cohort in compa rison to the cutoff for 10th grade -equivalent reading level.  
The REALM -Teen will be used to demonstrate (along with demographics) that adolescent 
subject s represent a diversity of age, race, educational attainment, and reading ability . 
However, given the relatively small absolute number of low literacy adolescents expected 
(if 25% of the sample of 175 adolescents meet the criteria, this would yield approximately 
44 low-literacy adolescents), low literacy adolescents will be included with  low literacy 
adult subject s to comprise the overall low literacy subgroup .

Given that literacy (as measured by [CONTACT_471850] -Teen ) is not known in 
advance and cannot be directly used in screening in an actual use trial , recruitment 
targets for low literacy  are not set . In self -selection and actual use studies that recruit in 
the typi[INVESTIGATOR_324615] , the proportion of low literacy subject s typi[INVESTIGATOR_274717] 12 -18%. 
In contrast with label comprehension studies, whose samples are meant to be 
approximately representative of the general population and therefore controlling for 
factors of interest like literacy is potentially justified, one of the overarching goals of an 
actual use tr ial is to enroll a sample based on individuals who present seeking the 
product, and this approximates  the likely OTC user population. Actual use trials seek to 
enroll subjects who seek out the product as they are those most likely to use the p roduct 
when available OTC.  In this case , forcing a certain percentage of low -literacy enrollment 
would compromise the representativeness of the sample in a manner that is inappropriate. While it is inappropriate to force a specified proportion of low lite racy 
subjects in an AUT , it is still important  to have a sample of low literacy participants of 
sufficient size to allow for conclusions to be drawn as to performance of study endpoints 
among subjects of low literacy. The total sample size of this study was selected to ensure 
that the absolute size of the subgroup of low literacy participants will be large enough to 
evaluate the endpoints  among those of low literacy . If 15% of 950 subjects are classified 
as low literacy by [CONTACT_471851] -Teen, the cohort of low literacy subjects will be 
approximately 143 subjects , representing a low literary subgroup of sufficient size.  As an 
illustration, the 95% confidence interval (exact)  around a point estimate of 85% for 143 
subjects is +/ -7%. 
6.[ADDRESS_604798] s will be contact[CONTACT_471852] a

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 39 of 67 The answers  to these questions  will be part of the study database and used to determine 
the performance of the endpoints . There will be a total of  2 phone interviews , one at day  
14 (with  an allowable window of ±3 days) and one at day 42±4 days , during which the 
nurses  will limit the dialogue with the subjects to the interview script.  
6.5 End-of-Study/Early Termination Telephone Interview   
The EOS interview will occur at  the end of the study  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_471810] 6-week call) , or upon early  termination from the study . All subject s will be 
contact[CONTACT_217702]  a trained nurse (Interviewer)  who will ask a series  of 
questions  related to the use of the study medication,  as well as collect information related 
to medications and AEs . 
As participation for that subject will then be complete, and therefore the risk of biasing 
future behavior irrelevant, this  end-of-study  interview will include direct questions about 
how the pr oduct was used . The answers to these questions will be part of the study 
database and used to determine the  performance of  some of the endpoints . 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the EOS interview will be conducted during the [ADDRESS_604799] ( with the instructions to use it ) to 
take home and use  at the end of the study . Nurse interviewers will inquire about the 
results of the pregnancy test during the EOS interview . An additional call will be placed 
at 7 days ± [ADDRESS_604800] and report the results.

7.1 Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of suspected causal relationship to the IP (s) 
will be reported as described  in the following sections. This study includes only one 
treatment group.  
While responsibility for collection, recording, and reporting of all AEs will be assumed by 
[CONTACT_471853] , study staff at the study sites will identify any spontaneous reporting of 
AEs to the site staff and facilitate the reporting to the centralized clinical nurse 
interviewers . All site staff and subjects will be provided with a 24- hour toll -free number to 
report an y adverse events or other issues.  Note that f or this section “Investigator” refers 
to the central principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_471811] .  
For all AEs, the  Investigator must pursue and obtain information  adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as a  serious adverse event  (SAE)  requiring immediate notification to the 
Sponsor or its designated representative. For all AEs,  sufficient information should be 
obtained by [CONTACT_357785]. The Investigator is 
required to assess causality . Follow -up by [CONTACT_471854] a level acceptable to the Investigator,  and the 
Sponsor  concurs with that assessment.  
As part of ongoing safety  reviews conducted by [CONTACT_1034], any non-serious  AE that is 
determined by [CONTACT_140064] . To 
assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested 
from the Investigator  to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the  context of 
the clinical trial.  
7.[ADDRESS_604801]’s  participation in the use phase of the study,  ie, prior to undergoing any 
study -related procedure and/or receiving IP, through and including  [ADDRESS_604802] after the active reporting 
period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the Investigator becomes aware of 
them; at a minimum, all  SAEs that  the Investigator  believes  have at least a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug are to be reported to the Sponsor.  
For non-serious  AEs the reporting period begins  from the time the subject has taken at 
least  [ADDRESS_604803] or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
• Abnormal test findings;

• Drug withdrawal;  
• Drug misuse;  
• Drug interactions;  
• Extravasation;  
• Exposure during pregnancy;  
• Exposure via breastfeeding;  
• Medication error;  
• Occupational exposure.  
7.[ADDRESS_604804] finding  should be reported 
as an AE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying  symptoms, and/or,  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical 
intervention, and/or,  
• Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the 
study,  significant  additional  concomitant  drug treatment,  or other  
therapy,  and/or,  
• Test result is considered to be an AE by  [CONTACT_9304] . 
Merely  repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any  of the above conditions, does 
not constitute an AE . Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not 
require  reporting as an AE.

• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial  
disruption of  the ability  to conduct normal life functions);  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth  defect ; 
• Is a m edically important event . 
Medical and scientific judg ement is exercised in determining whether an event is an 
important medical even t. An important medical event may not be immediately life 
threatening and/or  result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . However,  if it is determined that the 
event  may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
AE outcomes,  the important medical event  should  be reported as serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safety database (see Section on SAE Reporting Requirements).  
7.6 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471812] . Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) 
to a healthcare facility m eets these criteria. Admission also includes transfer within the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical  floor,  
medical  floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n does not include the following:  
• Rehabilitation facilities;  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] ( e.g., caregiver  relief);  
• Skilled nursing facilities;  
• Nursing homes;  
• Routine emergency  room admissions;  
• Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory  procedures).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471813] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505],  clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE . Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting 
condition (e.g., for work -up of persistent pre- treatment  lab abnormality);  
• Social admission ( e.g., subject  has no plac e to sleep);

should not be reported as AEs. However,  the medical  condition  for which  the procedure  
was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE . For example, an 
acute appendicitis  that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the 
AE and the resulting  appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.  
7.7 Severity Assessment  
If required on the AE CRFs, the Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, 
or SEVERE to de scribe the maximum intensity of the AE . For purposes of consistency, 
these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
MILD  Does  not interfere with subject's  usual  function.  
MODERATE  Interferes  to some extent  with subject's  usual  function.  
SEVERE  Interferes  significantly  with subject's  usual  function.  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is 
not necessarily an SAE . For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly 
with subject's usual  function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of 
the criteria for SAEs, listed above.  
7.8 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-  
serious) . The Investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable poss ibility that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an AE; generally , the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship should be provided . If the Investigator does not know whether or not 
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defin ed by [CONTACT_1034] . If the 
Investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational 
product", this should be clearly docum ented on study records.  
In addition, if the Investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the Investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF,

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 44 of 67 as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.  
7.9 Exposure During Pregnancy  
For IPs and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:  
• A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or being 
exposed ( e.g., due to treatment  or environmental  exposure)  or after 
discontinuing or having been  directly  exposed to the IP; 
• A male has been exposed ( e.g., due to treatment or environmental exposure) to 
the IP prior to or around  the time of conception  or is exposed during his  partner’s 
pregnancy.  
If a study  subject becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject’s treatment 
with the IP , the Investigator  must submit this information to the Sponsor as an EDP, 
regardless  of whether  an SAE has occurred. The i nformation submitted should include 
the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of 
pregnancy).  
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information for all pregnancy  
reports with an unknown outcome. The Investigator  will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify the Sponsor of the outcome as a 
follow up to the initial pregnancy report . In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity 
of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth . In the event of a termination,  the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural 
integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed  by [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test fi ndings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly  and the findings are 
reported).  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets  the criteria  for an SAE (i.e. ectopic pregnancy,  
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly  
[in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
Investigator  should  follow  the procedures  for reporting  SAEs.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:  
• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion.  
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_604806] to 
causality, as SAEs . In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs 
when the Investigator assesses the infant  death as related or possibly related  to 
exposure to IP . 
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by [CONTACT_737] . Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes  will be handled  on a case -by-case basis (e.g., follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604807] immediately  complete the SAE data 
collection form and send it by [CONTACT_471855] 24 hours  to the Sponsor ’s

Fax: [PHONE_9866] 03 52  
Email: pharmacovigilance@hra- pharma.com  
 
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life- threatening,  notification to the Sponsor must be 
made immediately,  irrespective of the extent of available AE information. This time  frame 
also applies to additional new informati on (follow -up) on previously forwarded  SAE 
reports as well as to the initial and  follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy . 
In the rare event that the Investigator  does not become aware of the occurrence of an 
SAE immediately (e.g., if an outpatient  study subject initially seeks  treatment  elsewhere),  
the Investigator  is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the 
time of his/her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAEs, the  Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the 
Sponsor in accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above. In addition, an  
Investigator  may be requested by [CONTACT_471856] -up 
information in an  expedited  fashion . This information collected for SAEs is more detailed 
than that captured on the AE CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in 
sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determination of possible causality . Information on other possible causes of the event, 
such as concomitant  medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject 
death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to 
the Sponsor or its designated  representative.

 Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for 
collection  of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF. Where the same data are 
collected,  the forms  must  be completed in a consistent manner . For example, the same 
AE term should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.  
 Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
Adverse event  reporting  to regulatory authorit ies, including  suspected  unexpected  serious 
adverse  reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  is the responsibility of the Sponsor  PV department and will 
be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations  by [CONTACT_1034] . 
[ADDRESS_604808]  interviews will be entered directly into an EDC 
application (DATATRAK  ONE, DATATRAK International, Inc .). Automatic data checks 
will alert users of discr epancies and inconsistencies, where applicable. In the event of a 
data entry error, u sers will have the ability to correct information previously entered . Data 
Management will review the information entered as defined in this protocol .  
All users will have  a unique login user name [CONTACT_2383], and system access 
privileges will be strictly controlled and documented. Whenever data is modified after the 
initial data entry process, a computer -generated audit trail entry will be created. The 
audit trail, user access privilege processes, and electronic signatures collected by [CONTACT_471857] [ADDRESS_604809] is the source.  
8.2 Data Management Plan 
A detailed Data Management Plan (DMP) will describe procedures to ensure the proper 
management and quality of study data and additional PEGUS Standard Operating 
Procedures ( SOPs ) specify the activities performed to ensure the quality, accuracy and 
reliability of the statistical analysis and the final study report.   
8.[ADDRESS_604810], one of the secondary endpoints  in this study  is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_471814]-selection metric . 
Conceptually, the self -selection decision can be characterized as a 2x2 table ( Table 4 
below) where the subject 's decision to select or not select the study product for use is 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604811] 's self -
reported health status and clinical characteristics.

YES NO 
YES (selectors)  Cell A  
Correct Decision  Cell B  
Incorrect Decision  
NO (non- selectors)  Cell C  
Incorrect Decision  Cell D  
Correct Decision  
 
The four cells in the self -selection matrix can be characterized as follows.  
Cell A:  Subject s who say the study product is right for them to use and based on 
their self -reported medical and demographic information, the study product is 
right for them to use.  
Cell B:  Subject s who say the study product is right for them to use and based on 
their self -reported medical and demographic information, the study product is not 
right for them to use.  
Cell C:  Subject s who say the study product is not right for them to use and based 
on their self -reported medical and demographic information, the study produc t is 
right for them to use.  
Cell D:  Subject s who say the study product is not right for them to use and based 
on their self -reported medical and demographic information, the study product is 
not right for them to use.  
8.[ADDRESS_604813]  will be classified on 
two key variables : (1) the selection decision and (2) the appropriateness of use given the 
selection decision, in order to populate the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 2x2 self -selection table ( Table 4 
above) . Subject s will be classified on these two variables as described in Sections 8.4.[ADDRESS_604814] s who 
offer modifying information in open- ended responses to neutral probing will be re -

Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604815] coder (as described 
in Section 8.4.3 ). 
 Appropriate to Use  
Non-selectors will be classified on the variable Appropriate  for Use as follows:  
Yes: meets the label criteria for use, representing those who could have 
selected appropriately, but did not  (Cell C ). 
No: does not meet the label requirements for use, and appropriately did not 
select  (Cell D ). This includes those subject s who otherwise might have met 
the strict criteria for appropriate use according to the DFL , but who give a 
medically appropriate rationale for their non- selection decision. For example, 
if a subject  who otherwise meets the labeled criteria for use does not select 
the product and for example cites the desire to use anot her EC product so 
they can restart hormonal contraception immediately  as their reason for not 
selecting, that subject  will be re -classified from Cell C to Cell D. A physician 
will review the casebook for each subject  who falls into Cell C to determine if 
any subject s meet that criterion.  
Selectors  will be classified on the variable Appropriate for Use as follows:  
Yes: either meets the strict label criteria for use (1- Correct Selectors) or 
reported and measured characteristics justify the selection decision (2-
Acceptable Selectors), representing those who chose to use the product who 
made a clinically acceptable decision despi[INVESTIGATOR_471815]  (Cell A ). 
No: does not meet strict label criteria and reported and measured 
characteristics do not justify the selection decision (3- Incorrect Selectors), 
representing those who chose to use the product, but should not have (Cell 
B).

including:  
a) No contraindications ( not pregnant or breastfeeding, no known allergy 
to any of the ingredients , no previous use of ella® within the same 
menstrual cycle, no use as regular birth control ) 
b) Is a woman of childbearing potential . This would include all women 
who do not report any of the following:  surgical sterilization (tubal

for at least one year  
c) Has had unprotected sex in the [ADDRESS_604816]   
2) Acceptable Selectors . Subject  does not meet the strict criteria of the DFL , 
but selection is classified as appropriate because they are judged 
clinicall y (see Section 8.4.3 ) to be an appropriate selector . This group is 
expected to be quite small.  
3) Incorrect Selectors . This group includes selectors who are not correct or 
acceptable, including having any of the following:

 Coding of Open- ended Responses 
The responses to open -ended questions will be coded to make them amenable to 
numeric analysis and display . Coding procedures will follow PEGUS Research SOP 
DAT:[ADDRESS_604819] 50% of subjects has been collected , listings of individual 
responses for each question will be created. The listings will be reviewed to discover the 
underlying conceptual structure suggested by [CONTACT_26739], and a coding frame (a list of categories, each of which is assigned a one or two -digit number) will be created for each 
question. The coding frames will be reviewed and revised as necessary when 100% of 
the data is collected and cleaned. When the coding frame is finalized, reviewed and 
approved, coding may be performed.  
Coding will be done us ing data from the final, clean data set . Two coders working 
independently will code each question with a significant number of responses (e.g. >25) . 
Their code assignments will then be compared and the Coding Supervisor will resolve 
any discrepancies . Multiple codes (typi[INVESTIGATOR_471816]) may be assigned to 
elements of one response. Once coded, these data will be displayed in standard 
frequency tables . For these tables, the unit of analysis, and thus the denominator, 
changes to become the number of responses rather than the number of subject s. 
9 DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS 
A detailed methodology for the statistical analyses  of the data collected in this study will 
be documented in a  Statistical Analysis  Plan (SAP), which will be finalized  prior to 
database lock . The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any 
major  modifications to the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment.  
This is a naturalistic, observational tr ial to assess  use patterns  from the prospective OTC 
population in a simulated OTC setting . The analyses will largely  employ descriptive 
statistics including frequencies, percentages and appropriate summary statistics.

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 51 of 67 and both qualify and agree to purchase and enter the use phase, it is expected that up to 
1270 subjec ts will need to be interviewed to yield 950 purchasers.  
Assuming approximately 95 0 purchasers, if 80% of those purchasers use the product  
within the study period, that would yield a user population of 76 0. Estimating 
approximately  40% of users will have ha d recent hormonal contraceptive use would yield 
a recent hormonal contraceptive users population of 305. Allowing for a further 20% loss 
to follow -up yields a user population of approximately [ADDRESS_604821] s 
and among several subgroups . As the analysis of actual use trials typi[INVESTIGATOR_471817] (and associated 95% confidence intervals) of individual endpoints, sample size is most often based on the number of subject s needed to 
constrain the confidence interval (CI ) to a limited range . For this study, assuming 85% 
correct response (the confidence interval depends on the actual point estimate), a sample of [ADDRESS_604822] s would constrain the CI to ± 3.1%. For purposes of illustration,

9.2 Analysis Populations  
The populations  of interests  are defined  as follows:  
• Responder Population:  Subjects who accept the invitation to participate and 
begin the screening process (including those who do not meet screening 
criteria for proceeding to the self-selection phase) . 
• Self-Selection Population:   Subject s who accept the invitation to participate 
and meet  study  inclusion criteria,  participate in a face-to-face interview at 
the study site  and make a self-selection and purchase decision.  
• Purchasers:  Subjects who meet study  enrollment criteria and purchase the 
study medication . 
• User  Population:   Subjects who take at least one dose of study  medication  
during the study .  
• Recent hormonal contraceptive users:  Subjects in the user population who also 
report recent hormonal contraceptive use (i.e., use of a hormonal contraceptive 
within the previous two months) .

A summary  of the  disposition of subjects (including  responders,  self-selection 
population, purchasers  and users ) and reasons for exclusion from these populations 
will be provided . Demographic  characteristics,  medical history  and other background 
information will be summarized for the responder , self-selection , purchaser,  and user  
populations.  
Frequencies  and percentages  will be presented for categorical data, mean,  standard 
deviation (SD);  median, and range will be presented for numerical data.  
Frequencies, percentages  and 2 -sided 95% CI  will be calculated  for the primary  and 
secondary  endpoints using the exact method . For the pr imary endpoints, it will be 
concluded that the established target threshold is reached if the lower  limit of the  CI of 
the point estimate  is equal to or exceeds  the value of the pre- determined threshold.   
Several of the endpoints are based on dosing instance, rather than by [CONTACT_1130], as 
subjects have the potential to take more than one dose over the course of the study.  
Correctness of selection or behavior can only be evaluated at the time of use, rather 
than at the time of purchase.  However, for each of t hose endpoints a secondary 
analysis by [CONTACT_471831].  
Endpoints  and demographics will be presented for subgroups of interest, with subject s 
dichotomized on the corresponding variables, which include (but are not necessarily limited to) lit eracy , gender , age (adolescent vs. adult women), and history of HBC use. 
A more detailed description of planned data analysis procedures will be found in the 
SAP which will be approved and signed before the database is locked.  
 Primary Endpoint Analysis 
Frequencies, percentages and two- sided exact 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated for the three primary endpoints for the entire study population and for selected 
subgroups.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  A:  Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances among user population taken  
within 120 hours (5 days) of most recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_471796].  
The first primary endpoint is the proportion in which the denominator includes all dosing 
instances of the IP and the numerator includes all dosing instances of the IP which were 
taken  within 120 hours (5 days) of the subject’s most recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_471796].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  B:  Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances among user population in which 
no more than one tablet was taken.  
The second primary endpoint is the proportion in which the denominator is all discrete 
dosing instances of  the IP and the numerator includes all dosing instances where no 
more than one tablet was taken .

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 53 of 67 [IP_ADDRESS]  C:  Self -Selection:  Proportion of female selectors who are not pregnant at the 
time of selection decision.  
The t hird primary endpoint is the proportion in which the denominator includes all 
females who selected to use the product (regardless of whether they purchased/used) 
and the numerator includes all female  select ors who were not  pregnant at the time of the 
selec tion decision.  In the case of subjects that report not being pregnant, sign consent 
and then receive a positive result on the pregnancy test, the second selection decision will be used for analysis of this endpoint.  
 Target Thresholds  
The threshold for the three  primary endpoints is 90%. The objective will be considered  
met for these endpoints  if the lower  bound  of the 2-sided 95% CI for each endpoint 
meets or exceeds the established threshold.  
• A:  Actual use: Proportion of dosing instances among user population taken  
within 120 hours (5 days) of most recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_471796].  
The Sponsor proposes to test this message as a primary endpoint because it  
communicates directions for effective use of ella®, and the limited time- window for its 
effective use. Use of ella® after [ADDRESS_604824]’s efficacy, 
although it is not expected to introduce any drug- related risks . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_471818], approved, and in- market  
for Plan B One -Step ( PBOS)  (which is “ Take as soon as possible and no later than 3 
days (72 hours) after  unprotected sex ”), the Sponsor  will test this as a primary endpoint . 
Testing it as a primary endpoint would test whether  the longer time window (5 vs 3 days) 
during which consumers may benefit from ella® use is well -followed. This would also 
allow us to confirm that consumers do not take ella® later after unprotected intercourse 
than recommended in the product label . 
A performance threshold of 90% is proposed because while taking the product within the 
5-day window  is very important to maximize effectiveness, taking it outside of the 5 days 
window  is not expected to introduce any serious drug -related risks.  
• B:  Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances  among user population in which 
no more than one tablet was taken.  
The Sponsor proposes to test this message as a primary endpoint in the context of 
FDA’s recommendation to demonstrate in an AUT whether consumers misuse ella® and 
one of the potential misus e scenarios would be the intake of more than the 
recommended dose, which would be assessed through this endpoint.  
A threshold of 90% was designated despi[INVESTIGATOR_471819] -finding studies using up to 
200 mg of UPA (more than 6 times the intended 30 mg dose) demonstrated no safety 
concerns (HRA2914- 503). Accordingly, it is likely that taking more th an the 
recommended dose is likely to impose little or no additional risk in women.

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 54 of 67 • C:  Self -Selection:  Proportion of female selectors who are not pregnant at  the 
time of selection decision.   
The Sponsor proposes to test this message as a primary endpoint as it would allow the 
study to confirm that consumers do not select  ella® if they know they are already 
pregnant.  
Of important note, the caution against use if already pregnant is on the approved and 
marketed PBOS DFL  that uses the exact same language as that proposed on the ella® 
DFL (“Do not use if you are already pregnant (because it will not work)” . The ella® LCS 
demonstrated that consumers understand this  warning extremely well . Moreover, data 
suggest use of ella® in pregnancy is safe . For ella®, the analysis of the global pregnancy 
safety database conducted in the context of the Ellipse II study has been specifically 
intended to assess the occurrence rates of outcomes of pregnancies exposed to ella® 
due either to failure of the EC or inadvertent exposure during pregnancy, including fetal 
and neonatal outcomes and maternal pregnancy complications . Data from the collected 
UPA-exposed pregnancies did not reveal a negative signal on the course of the 
pregnancy, its outcome, or the growth and development of the embryo and the fetus.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_471820] a pregnant woman to 
take ella®, this has been designated as a primary endpoint in this AUT with a 90% 
threshold.  
 Secondary Endpoint  Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  D:  Self -Selection:  Proportion of female selectors who are not breastfeeding at 
the time of selection decision.  
The first secondary endpoint is the proportion in which the denominator includes all 
females who selected to use the product (regardless of whether they purchased/used)  
and the numerator includes all female selectors who were not breastfeeding at the time 
of the selection decision.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  E:  Self -Selection:  Proportion of self -selection population who make a correct 
selection decision regarding use of the product . 
This endpoint is the proportion of those subjects making the self -selection decision who 
make a correct decision about whether the product is right for them to use , as outlined 
below . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Populating the Self -Selection Table  
Each subjec t will be classified on two key variables: (1) the selection decision and (2) the 
appropriateness of use given the selection decision, in order to populate the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 2x2 
self-selection table.  
Selection Decision:  The selection phase of the interview consists of the self -selection 
and purchase questions, with accompanying neutral follow -up questions . All subjects 
who go on to actually purchase the study product will be categorized as selectors . Even 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604825] will be classified as 
a selector or a non- selector primarily on the basis of the initial self -selection and 
purchase questions , or in the case of a positive enrollment pregnanc y result, the second 
self-selection and purchase question . However, all information recorded during the 
selection phase of the interview will be considered in the classification of subjects  as 
selectors or non- selectors . Subjects  who offer modifying inform ation in open- ended 
responses to neutral probing will be re- categorized accordingly.  
 
Appropriate to Use:   
Non-selectors will be classified on the variable Appropriate for Use as follows:  
Yes: meets the label criteria for use, representing those who could have 
selected appropriately, but did not ( Cell C ). 
No: does not meet the label requirements for use, and appropriately did not 
select ( Cell D ). This includes those subject s who otherwise might have met 
the strict criteria for appropriate use according to the DFL, but who give a 
medically appropriate rationale for their non- selection decision. For example, 
if a subjec t who otherwise meets the labeled criteria for use does not select 
the product and cites the fact that they are taking a medicine for Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) as their reason for not selecting (which 
otherwise does not disqualify a subject from using, but rather suggests that 
they talk to a doctor), that subjec t will be re -classified from Cell C to Cell D. A 
physician will review the casebook for each subject  who falls into Cell C to 
determine if any subject s meet that criterion.  
Selectors  will be classified on the variable Appropriate for Use as follows:  
Yes: either meets the strict label criteria for use (1- Correct Selectors) or 
reported and measured characteristics justify the selection decision (2-
Acceptable Selectors), representing those who chose to use the product who 
made a clinically acceptable decision despi[INVESTIGATOR_471815] (Cell A ). 
No: does not meet strict label criteria and reported and measured 
characteristics do not justify the selection decision (3- Incorrect Selectors), 
representing those who chose to use the product, but should not have (Cell 
B). 
Complete definitions of Correct, Acceptable, and Incorrect Selectors follow:  
4) Correct Selectors . Subject meets the strict criteria of the Drug Facts label, 
including:  
a) No contraindications (not pregnant or breastfeeding, no known allergy 
to any of the ingredients , no previous use of ella® within the same 
menstrual cycle, no use as regular birth control ) 
b) Is a woman of childbearing potential . This would include all women 
who do not report any of the following:  surgical sterilization (tubal 
ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or postmenopausal 
for at least one year  
c) Has had unprotected sex in the [ADDRESS_604826]

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 56 of 67 5) Acceptable Selectors . Subject does not meet the strict criteria of the Drug 
Facts label, but selection is classified as appropriate because they are 
judged clinically (see Section 8.4.3 ) to be an appropriate selector . This 
group is expected to be quite small.  
6) Incorrect Selectors . This gro up includes selectors who are not correct or 
acceptable, including having any of the following:  
a) A contraindication to the product (are pregnant or breastfeeding, has 
an allergy to one of the ingredients , previously used ella® within the 
same menstrual cycl e, or use as regular birth control ) 
b) Is a man 
c) Is a woman without childbearing potential . This would include all 
women who report any of the following:  surgical sterilization (tubal 
ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or postmenopausal 
for at  least one year  
d) Has not had unprotected sex in the [ADDRESS_604827]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_604828] critical self -selection decision is made by [CONTACT_471858], based on their health 
status, should not use the study drug (cells B and D) . Unlike an incorrect decision by 
[CONTACT_66256] s for whom this product is appropriate (cell C), an incorrect decision (cell B) by 
[CONTACT_471859].  
Because it is expected that very few subjects will be inappropriate for use, this endpoint will be measured by  [CONTACT_471860], taken from the self -selection table [(cell A + 
cell D)/(cell A + cell B + cell D)].  Again, note that this does not take into account cell C, 
as those subjects could have chosen to use the product, but did not (for whatever reason).  
Other proportions will also be presented, including the total correct selectors as 
described by [CONTACT_8028] [(cell A + cell D)  / (cell A + cell B + cell C + cell D)] and the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_45559] -selection metric, namely the proportion described by [CONTACT_8028] [cell D/( cell 
B + cell D)] . This proportion represents a correct non- selection decision. In other words, 
this is the proportion of those who should not select the product who correctly do not 
select  it.

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 57 of 67 [IP_ADDRESS]  F:  Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances amon g user population in which  
HBC is not taken  for 5 days after taking ella® 
This secondary endpoint is the proportion  in which the denominator includes all dosing 
instances of the IP and the numerator includes all dosing instances in which there is no 
report ed use of HBC for at least 5 days.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  G:  Actual Use:  Proportion of dosing instances among user population 
associated with use of hormonal contraceptives in the same cycle after taking 
ella® in which subject  report s using a condom (or other barrier method) every 
time they have  sex until their next menstrual period.  
This secondary endpoint is the proportion  in which the denominator includes all dosing 
instances of the IP among those who start or restart hormonal contraception in the same 
menstrual cycle and the numerator includes dosing instances where the subject  report s 
using condoms every time they have sex during the remainder of that menstrual period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  H:  Actual Use:  Proportion of user population who do not use the study product 
more than once in the same menstrual cycle.  
This secondary endpoint is the proportion in which the denominator includes all subjects 
who take at least one dose of the product (user population) and the numerator includes 
all subjects who do not use more than one dose (s) of the study  product  within the same 
menstrual cycle after taking the initial dose of ella®. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  I:  Self-Selection/Actual Use:  Proportion of self -selection population taking one 
of the “ask a doctor or pharmacist before use” products who do not select, who 
select but do  not use or who report contact[CONTACT_30697] a healthcare provider or 
pharmacist . 
This secondary endpoint is the proportion defined by [CONTACT_471861] -selection interview who report taking one of the “ask 
a doctor or pharmacists before use” compounds (including barbiturates,  carbamazepi [INVESTIGATOR_050], 
felbamate,  oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], rifampin, griseofulvin, a prescription 
drug to treat HIV/AIDS, bosentan, or a supplement containing St. John’s Wort) and the 
numerator is all such subjects who either do not select or use or who report t alking with 
a doctor or pharmacist about it use during the course of the study.   
 Other Measures Analysis  
The other measures are all simple proportions where the user population represents the denominator.  
J. Proportion of user population who use a HBC method sometime during the past 
two menstrual cycles.  
K. Proportion of user population who used  any EC on more than one  occasion  
within the study period.

9.4 Safety Analysis  
Adverse even t (AE) analyses will include all events which initially  occurred, or worsened 
following treatment . Adverse events will be summarized by  [CONTACT_471862] (MedDRA) System  Organ  Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) 
and classified according to their  severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and relationship 
(related or  not related) to study  product . For the summary by [CONTACT_926], subjects who have 
multiple  occurrences of the same AE will be classified according to the worst reported 
severity  of the AE. Similarly,  for the summary  by [CONTACT_471863], the 
AE will be  classified according to the worst relationship.  
9.5 Interim Analysis 
There will be no interim analysis for this study  
9.6 Missing Data  
All missing  data will be considered missing  and no statistical procedures will  be 
employed to estimate or impute missing data.  
9.7 Open- ended Data

10.1 Data Collection Instruments / Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to a paper data 
record, an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used 
in this st udy. 
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject . The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be made available in 
any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the Sponsor o r 
appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the Sponsor . 
Each investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all the 
clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collec tion 
forms (source documents)  that pertain to his or her phase of the study (enrollment 
interview and purchase for site investigators, follow up interviews and AE reports for the 
central investigator) . Each investigator is responsible for  ensuring that dat a collected are 
accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required . The CRFs must be signed 
by [CONTACT_471864] . Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604830] be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original 
entry.  
In most cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, will also serve as source documents . In 
these cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at the 
Sponsor and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which 
the CRF will stand as the source document.  
Data for thi s study will be entered directly into a validated EDC system . This system will 
provide a complete audit trail, which includes information about the initial data entry and 
all changes and deletions . When the data collection form is saved, data edits will check 
entries in each field and provide immediate notification to the interviewer of data that is 
unacceptable (a different value must be entered) or questionable (the data field must be 
checked and if left intact, an explanation must be given) . Using this s ystem, the 
interviewer will be able to correct entries or make clarifications while the subject  is still 
being interviewed.  
All users will have a unique login user name [CONTACT_2383], and system access privileges will be strictly controlled and documented. The audit trail, user access privilege 
processes, and electronic signatures collected by [CONTACT_471865] [ADDRESS_604831] ’s anonymity is maintained. On 
documents submitted to the Sponsor , subject s will not be identified by [CONTACT_471866], but by [CONTACT_471867].  
[ADDRESS_604832], evaluation and 
documentation of this study are designed to ensure that the S ponsor and study 
personnel abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP) guidelines . The study will also be 
carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_471821](s) and regulation(s) .  
SOPs from PEGUS Research will be followed to ensure quality . PEGUS staff will train 
and approve prospective interviewers prior to their work on the study . PEGUS Research

inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by [CONTACT_31691], 
who must provide support at all times for these activities.  
12 ETHICS  
The study will be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_39684](s) and regulation(s) .  
12.[ADDRESS_604834] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant 
documents, e.g., recruitment posters , if applicable, from the IRB/ IEC. All 
correspondence with the IRB/ IEC will be retained in the investigator file. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_54603]/IEC approvals will  be forwarded to the Sponsor . 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/ IEC 
approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to 
the subjects . In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/ IEC and the Sponsor  in 
writing immediately after the implementation.  
12.[ADDRESS_604835] of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations 
of Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of 
Helsinki (World Medical Association 2013).  
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline on GCP, and applicable local regulatory 
requirements and laws.  
PEGUS Research will o versee the process for the approval of all Investigators, trial 
protocol, informed consent forms and other relevant trial documents . All correspondence 
with the IRB will be retained in the trial files for each site . All records identifying subject s 
will be  kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or 
regulations, will not be made publicly available. Subject  names will be collected for 
compensation and follow -up purposes only and will not be linked to any study data. This 
information will not be supplied to the S ponsor or any other entity . No personal ly

PEGUS Research, Inc.   Page 61 of 67 identifiable information (PII) will be captured in the study database. In accordance with 
the Federal Privacy Standard, a Notice of Information Practices, which describes how 
subject s’ health information will be used and disclosed and how they can obtain access 
to this information, will be made available, if applicable.  
12.[ADDRESS_604836] be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor, approved by [CONTACT_32629] B/IEC before use, and available for 
inspection.  
The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], will obtain written informed consent from each subject before dispensing of study medication. The investigator will 
retain the original of each subject's signed consent document.  
Adolescents  recruited in this study , as some  may not have a high degree of parental 
involvement  and since requirement of parental consent might introduce risk in some 
circumstances , are NOT children for the purposes of this study . This is allowed for in 45 
CFR 46.408 (c) “…if the IRB determines that a research protocol is designed for 
conditions or for a subject population for which parental or guardian permission is not a 
reasonable requirement to protect the subjects (fo r example, neglected or abused 
children), it may waive the consent requirements … provided an appropriate mechanism 
for protecting the children who will participate as subjects in the research is substituted, and provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent with federal, state, or local law . 
The choice of an appropriate mechanism would depend upon the nature and purpose of 
the activities described in the protocol, the risk and anticipated benefit to the research 
subjects, and their age, maturity, status, and condition.”   Since adolescents are 
presenting to the research sites seeking emergency contraceptives on their own accord, 
they meet the criteria for a mature minor  in most states . Moreover, in most  cases, 
adolescents seeking emergency contrac eption would not need parental consent for 
treatment and reproductive services in most states, and may not meet t he definition of 
“children” in § 50.3(o) and thus would not be subject to the requirements  of 21 CFR 50 
subpart D . The definition provided is “ Children means persons who have not attained the 
legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in clinical investigations, 
under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be 
conducted. ” However, depending on the age of the adolescent enrolling in the study, 
some state laws and regulations may preclude the adolescent from receiving 
contraceptive services without parent consent (i.e., under age 12 in many states). Where 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604837] s will be kept confidential, and to the extent permitted by 
[CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. Subject  
names will be collected for compensation and follow -up phone calls  only. No personal 
identifiable information (PII) will be stored in the study database . This information will not 
be supplied to the S ponsor or any other entity . In accordance with the Federal Privacy 
Standard, a Notice of Information Practices, which describes how subject s’ health 
information will be used and disclosed and how they can obtain access to this 
information, will be made available, if applicable.  
Subject s’ implicit consent will be  obtained prior to collecting any personally -identifiable 
contact [CONTACT_3031]. Explicit verbal consent to gather sensitive data will be requested 
and documented prior to collecting any health or other sensitive information.  
Subject names, contact [CONTACT_3031], and other identifiable data will be  maintained 
entirely separate from the study database. All parties will ensure protection of subject  
personal data and will not include subject  names on any data forms, reports, 
publications, or in any other disclosures, except where required by [CONTACT_28769] . Personally -
identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting of a numbering system generated by [CONTACT_471868]- identify the study  subject . In case of data 
transf er, PEGUS will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subject  
personal data.  
12.4 Liability and I nsurance  
The Sponsor has s ubscribed to an insurance policy covering, in its terms and provisions, 
its legal liability for injuries caused to participating persons and arising out of this research performed strictly in accordance with the scientific protocol as well as with applicable law and professional standards.  
12.5 Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed ( i.e., clinical hold) by [CONTACT_1204], or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of t he IP, the 
Sponsor should be informed immediately.  
In addition, the investigator will inform the Sponsor immediately of any urgent safety 
measures taken by [CONTACT_471869], and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator 
becomes aware of.  
12.[ADDRESS_604838] s will spontaneously disclose informat ion that would trigger 
mandatory reporting requirements . However , interviewers will be trained in the 
mandatory reporting conditions in each state where the interviews are conducted and to 
Rx-to-OTC Switch ella ( ulipristal acetate 30  mg)  CONFIDENTIAL  
Actual Use  Trial Protocol 151032-[ADDRESS_604839] s will be informed in the 
introduction to the study that confidentiality will be strictly guarded, except for 
circumstances requiring reporting to authorities.  
13 SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regul atory authority 
decision, change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/ IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of 
the Sponsor . In addition, the Sponsor retains the right to discontinue development of 
ella® at any time.  
If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, the Sponsor will promptly notify the 
investigator . After notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_471870] . As directed by [CONTACT_1034] , all 
study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

Unfortunately, the generalizability of these findings to other diverse populations is unclear since the vast majority of clinical research has been conducted in non-Hispanic men with affordable access to medical care. In addition, studies examining the population of people regularly engaged in physical activity in this country have indicated that lack of physical activity is particularly prevalent in Hispanic groups compared to non-Hispanic white individuals. In terms of gender, a significantly high percentage (74%) of Hispanic women do not participate in exercise activities and this number climbs with age. While there a number of reasons for this occurrence, a significant contributor includes lack of resources and accessibility to programs that promote PA and exercise.  1.2. Role of Physical Activity in Chronic Neurological Disorders  Neurological disorders, including stroke, headache, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis represent the most common cause of disability world-wide7. While there are treatments available for many disorders, these medications often provide modest relief and are expensive with limited accessibility to this population we serve. There also remain no effective cures.  In the last decade, published studies have supported the vital role of PA  (particularly exercise) in many chronic neurological disorders by [CONTACT_196784], quality of life, and potentially modifying disease course1,8. A limitation is that the majority of studies have been conducted in non-Hispanic white populations.  In addition, PA is known to be significantly lacking in the Hispanic population overall, particularly in Hispanic women. This application will begin to address this gap by [CONTACT_196785].     1.3. The Wellness Center at the Historic General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196776] (TWC) located next to Los Angeles County/University of Southern [LOCATION_004] (LAC +USC) medical center, serves a large and diverse ethnic population, many of whom are Hispanic and live within close proximity to LAC+USC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. TWC serves as a community center and is also a referral for patients seen at the LAC/USC Outpatient Neurology Clinics. TWC offers an opportunity to engage this diverse ethnic population of patients in an educational exercise program, along with coaching and social support, factors that have been shown to promote behavioral change.   1.4. Hypothesis  The primary goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a Fitbit charge to monitor and promote physical activity in a diverse population of Hispanic women with chronic neurological disorders. Hispanic women will also receive behavioral coaching using a Lifestyle Redesign approach (see below) to enhance physical activity in their daily lives. The secondary goal of this proposal is to investigate whether changes in physical activity are associated with (i)  quality of life including perception of health and well- being and (ii)  
Monitoring Physical Activity in Hispanic Women with Chronic Neurological Disorders Page 4 of 11 Version date: 5/1/[ADDRESS_233589] of PA on chronic neurological diseases in a diverse and inclusive Hispanic population in LA County.    2.1.1 Specific Aim 1 Specific Aim 1 establishes feasibility of this approach by [CONTACT_196786] a Fitbit Alta HR activity monitor in Hispanic women with chronic neurological diseases.  Adherence will be determined through: (i) the average hours/day of use; and (ii) the length of time (percent of total study days) of usage throughout the 16-week study. Adherence defined as (i)  5 or more days/week  of use and (ii) 10 or more hours of use during the day.   2.1.2 Specific Aim 2 Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that an increase in physical activity will be correlated with a decrease in LA County (LAC) Facilities health care use  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196777]). Physical activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_196787]: (i) the average number of steps/week; and (ii) average time spent in sedentary, light, or moderate to vigorous intensity based on MET (metabolic expenditure) of physical activity/week. Methods: Changes in PA outcome metrics over the 16-week period will be correlated with the total number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/outpatient clinic visits. Total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196778]/DHS (Department of Human Services) electronic medical records and will include outpatient provider visits, emergency room and urgent care visits, total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and days spent in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  2.1.3 Specific Aim 3 Specific Aim 3a tests the hypothesis that increase in physical activity is associated with an increase in the quality of life (QOL). Physical activity will be measured through: (i) the average number of steps/week; and (ii) average intensity of physical activity/week.  QOL will be determined through measures of self-rated health and well-being.  These Spanish validated surveys will  include illness perception questionnaire and health and well-being questionnaire    3.[ADDRESS_233590] 
Monitoring Physical Activity in Hispanic Women with Chronic Neurological Disorders Page 5 of 11 Version date: 5/1/2019 on Neurological Health.  Twenty Hispanic women seen at LAC/USC Neurology clinic will be referred to TWC and invited to participate in a physical activity (PA) study for 16 weeks. Participants will receive individualized Fitbit Charge activity monitors at baseline and instructed on its usage and maintenance.  Adherence to activity monitor use and amount and level of PA will be determined.  All assessments that include quality of life, exercise behaviors, and self-rated health and mood will be made at baseline and at 16 weeks at TWC. Educational/coaching will take place through (i) individualized instruction on exercise at baseline and at the end of week 4 at TWC and (ii) weekly calls from TWC to promote PA goal setting as well as Fitbit use. At the end of week 1, participants will be asked to return to the TWC to review instructions on Fitbit App use and to receive further education on the benefits of exercise through a brief Power Point presentation. Patient may also receive text messages throughout the study to remind them of upcoming appointments or deadlines. General Neurological Health status will be determined through use of Electronic medical records to determine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196779] [ADDRESS_233591]-study call to assess the continued usage of the Fitbit charge activity monitor and a quality of life questionnaire.  3.2 Enrollment Plan  Twenty (20) Hispanic women with a chronic neurological disorder will be recruited from our LAC/USC Neurology Clinic.  We expect to achieve this goal by [ADDRESS_233592] of inclusion/exclusion criteria.  This will include talking to the referral neurology doctor from the neurology clinic to determine there are no limitations to physical activity/exercise (see exclusion below) .The principal investigators and members of the research team will explain the purpose, risks, procedures, and date of the study. If the subject is interested in participating, she will be given the Informed Consent to read or if they cannot read, our coordinator will read the informed consent to her.  Subjects and their family members will be allowed sufficient time to read and/or think about the Informed Consent Form and be given the opportunity, and encouraged, to ask questions before signing the document. Following the patient giving informed consent (signing the document) she will be able to participate in the study. If the investigator or study team members have any reason to suspect that the subject does not fully comprehend the informed consent or the study, the individual will not be considered as a possible participant of the study. The study will be conducted after having Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at USC.  3.4 Fitbit Charge HR2 Activity Monitor Participants will be provided a Fitbit Alta HR and wall charger. Each participant will be given a unique ID# that will be assigned at baseline and used to set-up the Fitbit data acquisition. The Fitbit app will also be set up on their smartphone to allow self-monitoring of activity. The Fitbit device includes both an accelerometer and heart rate monitor and is capable of continuous measuring and storing data at up to a 1-second sampling rate for up to 5 days. Fitbit data will be passively downloaded through either a WiFi and/or smartphone connection

Fitabase (Fitabase, San Diego, Ca) is a research friendly application programming interface and comprehensive data management program that allows the device data from all users to be identified through a uniquely assigned ID# and transmitted in a secure fashion to the data acquisition and integration center.  The Fitbit Alta will be worn on the wrist every day during the course of the 16-week study. While the Fitbit is water resistant, participants will be asked not to wear the device while bathing or swimming. Participants will be instructed on self- monitoring, usage and maintenance of the Fitbit at the baseline visit. Participants will be monitored for Fitbit compliance by (i) weekly phone calls; and (ii) monitoring of passively downloaded Fitbit data through Fitabase data collection server. Further instructions will also be given [ADDRESS_233593]-study will assess continued use of the Fitbit activity monitor.   3.5 Educational/Behavioral Coaching on Exercise (Lifestyle Redesign)  Participants will receive individualized goal setting and a guide to increase exercise at the beginning of the study (baseline) and at week four (week four visit) at TWC. The Occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT) will administer a well published approach for promoting PA called Lifestyle Redesign which addresses physical, psychosocial and environmental barriers to health and incorporate self-care strategies and goal setting. Coaching will be administered by a bilingual OT ([CONTACT_196790]) and in language (Spanish or English) preferred by [CONTACT_3445].  Based on studies examining PA and brain health, the Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT) will guide the participant through a goal setting process for moderate to vigorous intensity of physical activity including a specific guide plan to achieve these goals of 10,000 steps per day and/or 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous activity. Participants will also receive weekly calls from the TWC (supervised by [CONTACT_116056]) to review PA and goal setting for each week over the course of the 16-week study.   3.5.1 Motivation to Exercise   Participants will be given a brief Power Point presentation titled “Promoviendo un Cerebro Sano En las Enfermedades Neurologicas, el Rol Del Ejercicio”. The purpose of this presentation is the educate participants on the importance of exercise for brain health and increase motivation throughout the study. This presentation will be given at baseline visit, week 1, and week 4 follow up.  3.6 Primary Outcome Measures  3.6.1 Baseline Demographic Data Following inclusion and exclusion and after obtaining informed consent, baseline demographic data will be obtained which will include age, recent healthcare visit frequency, medical history, medication, years of education, and tobacco use.    3.6.2 Physical Activity, Adherence Assessment Data gathered from Fitbit based device will be stored, visualized and aggregated through a commercially available service (Fitabase Inc, Https:/www.Fitabase.com). Fitabase is a research friendly application

Study design
This study  will be a single blind, randomised, multi-centre, active controlled trial.  Patients 
aged from 3 months to less than 18 y ears with complicated intra -abdominal infections (cIAIs) 
will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment groups (3:1 ratio): CAZ -AVI in combination with 
metronidazole versus meropenem. Randomisation will be stratified appropriately .  Patients 
aged from 3 months to <1 year (Cohort 4b) must have been born at term (defined as 
gestational age ≥37weeks).
Patients will r eceive intravenous (IV) treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full day s, ie, 
9doses) before having the option to switch to an oral therap y as specified below.  The 
decision to switch to oral therap y is entirel y at the Investigator’s discretion, if the pa tient has 
good or sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.
Patients will be assessed for safety  and efficacy  throughout the study , and blood samples will 
be taken for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment.  The duration of each patient’s participation in 
the study  will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 day s after start of study  treatment 
(defined as the time point at which first dose of study  treatment is administered) at which time 
there will be a late follow -up ( LFU) assessment visit.  The L FU is to be performed [ADDRESS_415452] dose of an y treatment.

Target patient population
Patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 y ears with cIAI.  
Duration of treatment
The IV stud y treatment is to be given for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie, 9 doses).  At 
any time after a minimum of 72 hours of IV study  treatment has been received, there is an 
option to switch to an oral therap y, as specified below.  The decision to switch to oral therap y 
is entirely  at the Investigator’s discretion, if the patient has good or sufficient clinical 
respon se, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food. The total period of treatment (ie, IV 
drug or oral switch therapy ) is to be between [ADDRESS_415453] , dosage and mode of administration
The study  is single blind, ie, a Blinded Observer will not know the patient’s treatment 
assignment and will conduct clinical assessments (including efficacy  and safety ).  There is no 
use of placebo to act as a treatment bl ind.
Intravenous CAZ- AVI infusions will be given at doses based on the age and weight of the 
patient with adjustment according to renal function:

6(88)The Investigator should follow the package insert for meropenem for dose modifications 
associated with renal impairment.
Patients whose CrCl drops below 30 mL /min should be withdrawn from study  therapy .  
Patients withdrawing from study  therap y can be administered alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_336281]’s choice, which should be recorded in the Case Report Form.  If possible, patients 
should still be followed for safet y.  Because the CrCl determination is only an estimate of 
renal function, in instances where the CrCl is approaching thresholds that would require 
intervention such as a dose change o r discontinuation of therapy  (ieCrCL approaching 50 or 
30
mL/min) , the Investigator should use his or her discretion in determining (ie confirming the 
value b y repeat testing, if feasible) whether an immediate dose change, a short period of 
continued observation, or discontinuation of therapy  is warranted. If in the op
inion of the 
Investigator there is a clinically  significant reduction in a patient’s estimated CrCl during the 
treatment period, then the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_336324] (immediate dose change, a short period of continued observation, or 
discontinuation of therapy ). Additionally , in instances of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_336282], the 
Investigator should increase the frequency  of CrCl monitoring, depending on the patient’s 
clinical status, extent of renal function change and I nvestigator’s clinical evaluation.
The suggested dosing regimen of m etronidazole is10mg/kg IV over 20 to 30 minutes every  
8hours (±30 minutes) , but it can also be prescribed/adjusted by  [CONTACT_336325]. The metronidazole infusion will be started no later than 30 minutes after 
completion of the CAZ -AVI infusion.
An optional switch to oral therap y is permitted on or after Stud y Da y 4 (ie, after 72 hours of 
IV study  drug) .  The decision to switch to oral the rapy is entirel y at the Investigator’s 
discretion, if the patient has good or sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating 
oral fluids or food :
Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid ( only in countries where its use for children is 
permitted; acco rding to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per 
standard of care), or
Oral ciprofloxacin ( only in countries where its use for children is permitted; according 
to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care) plus 
metronidazole (administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or
Pathogen -based therapy (in discussion with the Medical Monitor) .  The choice of oral 
antibacterial agent for pathogen -based therapy  will be driven by  [CONTACT_109972] a 
susceptibility  test, which will be provided tothe Investigator b y either the local or 
central labo ratory .  Initiation of pathogen- based therap y is at the Investigator’s 
discretion.
  Before administering pathogen -based therap y, the Investigator will discuss 
the results of the susceptibility  test and the selected antibacterial drug (which should be 
approved for use in children) with the Medical Monitor.

Meropenem 20 mg/kg every  8 hours (±1 hour) given by  [CONTACT_336326]  
15 to 
30 minutes or up to 1 hour, or infusion duration as per local guidelines , with optional oral 
switch therap y as described above.  For patients weighing over 50 kg, the maximum dose of 
meropenem should not exceed 1 g every  8 hours.  
Statistical methods
Block randomisation using an interactive voice/web response s ystem will be used to assign 
patients in a ratio of 3:1 to the study  treatment groups of CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole or 
meropenem, respectivel y, in each of the cohorts for the age groups.  All study data will b e 
summarised within each age cohort separatel y and also overall (regardless of age cohort).
Safety data
The primary  objective will be to assess the safet y and tolerability  of CAZ -AVI plus 
metronidazole compared with comparator ( meropenem) .  Safet y data inc lude AEs, clinical 
laboratory  parameters, vital signs, ECG parameters, and phy sical examinations.  For each 
safet y variable, the last assessment made prior to the first dose of stud y drug will be defined as 
the baseline.  All safety  data collected from thi s study  will be summarised by  [CONTACT_336327] (ie, for CAZ
-AVI plus metronidazole versus meropenem irrespective of 
switching to oral therap y) for all patients who received an y amount of study treatment (termed 
the ‘Safet y anal ysis set’) ,and key data will also be summarised for those patients who 
received at least 72 hours of study treatment (termed the ‘Safety  evaluable anal ysis set’ ) by 
[CONTACT_336328].  Descriptive statistics will be produced to summarise the safety  data.  
Safety  data from this study  will be combined with those from another CAZ- AVI paediatric 
study  for complicated urinary  tract infections (D4280C00016) and will be presented in the 
same way .
The incidence of AEs and SAEs will be summarised by  [CONTACT_336329], according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities vocabulary , by [CONTACT_6490].  The summaries will also be produced b y relationship to study  drug, and by  [CONTACT_336330] .  AEs leading to discontinuation from study  treatment will a lso be summarised.  
Summary  tables for clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, ECGs, and ph ysical examination 
findings will be produced.
Descriptive efficacy data and patient characteristic/Baseline data
Efficacy  will be assessed descriptivel y in the inten
t-to-treat (ITT) set (all randomised 
patients) , the microbiological ITT (micro -ITT) set (all randomised patients who have a 
baseline pathogen known to cause cIAI), the clinically  evaluable (CE) anal ysis set (patients 
who meet minimal disease criteria for c IAI and all evaluability  criteria, including patients who 
received at least 72 hours of the intended dose and duration of IV study  drug, and for whom 
sufficient information regarding the infection is available to determine the patient’s outcome ),

criteria for cIAI and all evaluability  criteria similar to the CE anal ysis set, and have at least 
1typi[INVESTIGATOR_336283], ie, 
CAZ -AVI and meropenem) . 
Efficacy  will be assessed in the ITT, micro -ITT, CE , and ME analysis sets with respect to the 
proportion of patients with clinical response outcome of cure (at the end of 72 hours’ 
treatment, EOIV, the EOT, and the TOC visit) andclinical response outcome of relapse (at the 
LFU visit).  Favourable microbiological response will be assessed in the ME and the 
micro
-ITT analysis sets, and the number of patients with emergent infections (up to LFU) will 
be assessed in the ME analy sis set .  Patients in the ITT, micro -ITT, CE ,and ME anal ysis sets 
will be summarised according to the randomised treatment assignment .
Descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be provided for continuous variables, and counts and percentages will be 
presented for categorical variables.  All summaries will be presented b y treatment group.  
Demographic data and other baseline characteristic data will also be summarised.
Pharmacokinetic data
Pharma cokinetic assessment will be conducted for the PK anal ysis data set.  The data set will 
consist of all patients who will receive CAZ -AVI treatment, and have at least 1 ceftazidime 
and/or avibactam plasma measurement available. 
A listing of ceftazidime and avibactam concentrations at the nominal sampling windows by  
[CONTACT_336331].  For Cohorts 1 to 4b, the plasma concentration will be 
summarised by  [CONTACT_336332] (eg, 
number, mean, SD, minimum, median, maximum, geometric mean, lower and upper SD 
bounds [geometric mean ±SD], and coefficient of variation).
In addition, the avibactam and ceftazidime concentration, paediatric patient demographics, 
and disease status data from Cohorts 1 t o 4b will be combined with the data from appropriate 
previous clinical studies in paediatric patients and/or adults for a population PK analysis.  The 
actual dosing and plasma sampling times will be used for the anal ysis.  The developed 
population PK model may be used to conduct simulations to determine probability  of PK/PD 
target attainment to help to justify  the CAZ -AVI dose regimens for paediatric patients with 
cIAI.  A stand- alone population PK modelling and simulation analy sis plan will be prepared 
andthe results will be reported in a stand -alone report outside of the clinical study  report.

16(88)1. INTRODUCTION
1.[ADDRESS_415462] Class A, Class C and some Class D β lactamase -producing pathogens 
including those commonly  associated with complicated intra -abdominal infections (cIAIs) and 
complicated urinary  tract infections (cUTIs).  Avibactam, when comb ined with ceftazidime, 
has also been shown to be active against strains that express a combination of β -lactamase 
types, as well as strains that are concomitantly  resistant to other antibacterial classes such as 
fluoroquinolones.  
Beta-lactamase inhibitio n by [CONTACT_336333] a stable covalent 
carbamo yl linkage to the enzy me complex.  I t inhibited Class A and Class C β -lactamases b y 
50% at lower concentrations than other currentl y marketed β -lactamase inhibitors such as 
clavul anic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam.  In addition, avibactam is a potent inhibitor of 
Class C enzy mes whereas clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam lack any  activity  against 
this class of enzy mes.  Unlike currentl y available β -lactamase inhibitors, a vibactam does not 
induce β -lactamase production.  
Avibactam inhibited Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) -
2 β-lactamase in vitro and 
restored ceftazidime susceptibility  to Enterobacteriaceae -harboring KPC -2 or KPC -3 
β-lactamase ( Stach yra et al 2009).  The potent in vitro activity  of the ceftazidime and 
avibactam (CAZ -AVI) combination against Enterobacteriaceae -producing Class A, and 
Class C, β- lactamases has been confirmed in vivo in murine pneumonia, septicaemia, and 
pyelonephritis models.  
Currently  the options for the treatment of Gram -negative infections, especially  multi- drug 
resistant strains including extended- spectrum β -lactamase producers, are extremel y limited.  
Until recentl y, there have been no new investigational compounds under early or late 
development specifically targeted to combat these organisms.  Hence, the availability  and 
development of new agents to treat these infections will be a welcome addition to the existing 
treatments.  
Details of the CAZ -AVI clinical development programme to date can be found in 
Section 5.2.2 of the CAZ -AVI Investigator’s Brochure.  
The purpose of this stud y is to assess the safet y, tolerability  and d escriptive efficacy  of 
CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole versus meropenem in patients aged from 3 months to less than 
18 yearswith cIAI.  Data from this study  will be compared to similar data generated in adult 
patients so as to be able to extrapolate efficacy  and tolerability  to children.  The dosing 
regimen(s) has been chosen based on the paediatric pharmacokinetic (PK) study  and 
PK/pharmacod ynamic (PD) modelling of the exposure, required for the successful treatment 
of infections used in Phase 3 adult studies.

17(88)1.[ADDRESS_415463] the Blinded Observer will assess the safet y and the 
clinical cure without bias.  Given the risk to patients and severit y of disease, a 
placebo
-controlled t rial would not be ethicall y appropriate.  
The study  is designed to include patients < 1 year of age who are born at term only  (defined as 
a gestational age ≥37 weeks).  Maturation during foetal life and after birth is a process 
involving all organs and functions of the growing human.  As such, all the main steps of drug 
disposition (absorpt ion, distribution, metabolism, catabolism, elimination/excretion) may  be 
under the influence of still incomplete morphological stages.  An incompletely  absorbed 
compound may  be less effective whereas a poorl y metabolized and/or excreted compound 
may result in an increased risk of toxicity .  Both risks will have to be evaluated.  Better 
understanding of the maturing kidney  should help to anticipate possible early  and late adverse 
effects of drugs in neonatal populations.  Nephrogenesis is completed b y the en d of 34th week 
of gestation and the kidney  of a full -term neonate (ie, between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation) 
possesses a full set of nephrons and adult levels of glomerular filtration rate are reached 
between 1 and 2 years of age.  Therefore, patients <1 y ear of age who were born pre -term are 
excluded from this study .
This study  will be conducted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336284] (IV) antibiotics.  The CAZ -AVI doses in this trial have been 
selected to achieve similar exposures reached in the Phase 3 studies in adults (D4280C00001 
and D4280C00005), with the intention of reaching the same level of efficacy (for further 
details regarding the dose selection rationale, please refer to the CAZ -AVI Inv estigator’s 
Brochure).
Complicated intra- abdominal infections are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_336285], potentially  involving 
anaerobes such as the Bacteroides fragilis group.  Metronidazole will be added to CAZ- AVI 
to provide coverage for anaerobic organisms.  The spe ctrum of activity  of CAZ -AVI when 
combined with metronidazole is well suited to treatment of pathogens commonly  responsible 
for cIAIs.  
Meropenem is approved and widel y used for the safe treatment of cIAIs, and carbapenems are 
considered the drugs of choi ce for treating infections due to extended spectrum 
β-lactamase -producing Gram -negative bacilli.  The dose/regimen of meropenem tobe used in 
this trial is described in Section 7.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
This study  is the first study  with therapeutic intent for CAZ- AVI in children with cIAIs; 
however, the doses of CAZ- AVI have previously shown to achieve similar exposures in adults 
and chi ldren, so efficacy  of CAZ -AVI in children is likely .

18(88)Cohort 4 ( ≥3 months to <2 y ears) includes very  young patients (aged from 3 months to 
<6months) who are particularl y vulnerable in terms of lack of a ph ysiological reserve and 
rapid maturation of organs.  Therefore, in order to ensure that exposure (maximum 
concentration and area under the curve) was minimised in this group, while also still assuring 
robust predictions of sufficient exposure above the PK/PD target, Cohort 4 was divided into 
2parts for further anal ysis for dose selection: Cohort 4a (from 1 year to <2 years) and 
Cohort 4b ( ≥3 to <1 year).  This anal ysis indicated that a lower dose of 40 mg/kg 
ceftazidime/10 mg/kg avibactam reduces exposure in Cohort 4b, while still providing very  
high pre dictions of sufficient exposure above the PK/PD target ( ≥98% probability  of target 
attainment) in patients with normal renal function and patients with mild renal impairment. 
Thus, for the purposes of dosing in this study , Cohort 4 is split into Cohort 4a,who will 
receive the same dose as Cohort 2 (50 mg/kg ceftazidime/12.5 mg/kg avibactam, every  
8hours), and Cohort 4b, who will receive 50 mg/kg ceftazidime /12.5 mg/kg avibactam, every  
8hours for patients from 6 months to <1 year of age, and 40 mg/kg ceft azidime/10 mg/kg 
avibactam for patients from 3 months to <[ADDRESS_415464] been chosen on the basis of 
modelling and simulation to achieve similar exposures of both ceftazidime and avibactam to 
those in adults with normal or mild renal impairment and predictions of sufficient exposure 
above the PK/PD target.
Patients enrolled into this clinical study  will have cIAIs that are of sufficient severity  to 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336286].  The potential benefit to patients 
participating in this study is that they  will receive effective antibiotic therapy  for their 
infection.  The potential benefit of this study , in general, is the identification of a novel 
antibiotic combination pro duct that is a safe and effective treatment for cIAIs in the paediatric 
population, in the face of the changing pattern of antibiotic resistance. The safet y and 
tolerability  of CAZ -AVI was established in a Phase 1 s tudy in children from 3 months to 
<18years, during which the exposures were similar to those observed in adults.
It is possible that CAZ -AVI may  not be as effective a treatment as the comparator for 
treatment of cIAIs.  Although this risk is mitigated partly  by [CONTACT_336334][INVESTIGATOR_336287] b y the Investigator 
providing treatment. Furthermore, drug -drug interaction studies conducted between CAZ -AVI 
and metronidazole did not demonstrate an y drug interaction or adverse safety impact.

immediate lyfollowed by 500 mg I V metronida zole, or 1000 mg IV meropenem , and 
529patients in each treatment arm received study treatment.   Study  treatments were

Gram-negative pathogens, which was conducted in 333 adults aged 18 to 90 y ears diagnosed 
with c IAI or cUTI.  The dose administered was 2000 mg ceftazidime/[ADDRESS_415466] of Cure (TOC) visit, the estimated clinical cure 
rate at the T OC visit was 90.9% for CA Z-AVIand 91.2% for BAT. InthemMITTanalysis
set,theper-patient favourable microbiological response rate forpatients with cUTI at the TOC 
visit was higher in the CAZ- AVI group than in the BAT group 
(81.9% versus 64.2% , 
respectivel y). 
There were no definitive conclusions of an ytreatment -related trends in patients with cIAI, 
and there were no obvious safe ty concerns identified from the data available. In the patients 
with cUTI, the proportion who experienced an AE up to the Late Follow -up ( LFU) visit was 
28.3% in the CAZ -AVI group and 35.3% in the BAT group.  For patients with cUTI and cIAI, 
themajority of AEs were mild or moderate in int ensity. Up to the LFU visit, the i ncidence of 
serious adverse events ( SAEs )was low and balanced across treatment groups (5.5% in the 
CAZ-AVI group and 6.0% in the BAT group).  All SAEs were assessed as not causally
related to the study treatment by[CONTACT_12244] r. The number of patients with AEs of special 
interest (AEoSI) wasgeneral lylow and balanced across treatment groups, with the exception 
of diarrhoea in patients with cUTI, which was higher in the BAT group (5.9% and 2.0%, for 
BAT and CA Z-AVI, respective ly).  No new safet yconcerns were identified from the safety
topi[INVESTIGATOR_23254]. Thefrequenc y ofpotentiall

A Phase 2 study  (NXL104/2001) examining the safety  of CAZ -AVI versus imipenem 
cilastatin followed b y appropriate oral therap y as a comparator was conducted in 137 patients 
aged 18 to 90 years with cUTIs.  In this study patients were randomised 1:1 and given 500 mg 
ceftazidime and 125 mg avibactam IV every  8hours or 500 mg imipenem cilastatin IV every  
6 hours.  Approximately  35% of patients in the CAZ -AVI group and 42% of patients in the 
imipenem cilastin group experienced a local reaction at the IV infusion site.   The majority  of 
the infusion site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity .  One patient in the imipenem 
cilastatin group experienced a severe local reaction (induration, swelling).  The most common 
infusion- related events across the treatment arms w ere ery thema, pain and tenderness.  Of 
note, patients in the CAZ- AVI group received 3 infusions per day , while patients in the 
imipenem cilastatin group received 4 infusions per day .

20(88)In the Phase 2 stud y (NXL104/2002) examining CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole v ersus 
meropenem as a comparator in patients with cIAIs, approximately  30% of participants in both 
the CAZ -AVI and meropenem comparator treatment groups experienced at least [ADDRESS_415467] frequently  
across both groups.  The majority  of infusion site events were mild.  There was a somewhat 
greater percentage of patients with infusion site events of moderate/severe intensity  in the 
CAZ -AVI group, who also received IV metronidazole (17/101 patients [16.8%]) versus the 
meropenem group (11/102 patients [10.8%]).  Of note, patients in the CAZ- AVI plus 
metronidazole group received an infusion of [ADDRESS_415468] patients in the 
meropenem group received an infusion with
1study  drug per dose.
A Phase 1, open -label, single- dosestudyto characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK)of
CAZ
-AVI and assess its safe ty and tolerability  following a single IV dose was conducted in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336290] 3 months to <18 years, receiving systemic antibiotic 
therap yfor suspected or confirmed infection. The patients in this study  were stratified by [CONTACT_336335]: Cohort 1, patients aged ≥12 to 
<18years; Cohort 2, patients aged ≥6 to <12years; Cohort 3, patients aged ≥2 to <6 years; 
and Cohort 4, patients aged ≥3 months to <2 years (split into [ADDRESS_415469] 4 patients 
each, ≥3months to <1 year and ≥1year to <2 years).  
Patients in Cohort 1 and any patients in Cohort 2 we ighing ≥40 kg received a single IV dose of 
CAZ-AVI (2000 m g ceftazidime and 500 mg avibactam) administered as a single infusion 
over a 2-hour period onDay 1.  Patients in Cohort 2 weighing <40 kg received a single IV 
dose of C AZ-AVI(50 m
g/kg ceftazidime and 12.5 mg/kg avibactam) administered as a single 
infusion over a 2 -hour period onDay 1.  These doses were applicable for patients with normal 
renal function and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CrCl] >50 to ≤80 mL /min).
In Cohorts 3 and 4, patients with normal renal function or mild renal insufficiency  received a 
single IV dose of CAZ- AVI (50 mg/kg ceftazidime and 12.5 mg/kg avibactam) on Day  1. 
Each patient in the stud y received a single IV dose of CAZ-AVI administered as a continuous 
infusion over a 2- hour period.  There were [ADDRESS_415470] that the plasma ceftazidime and avibactam 
concentration profiles were similar in all 4 co horts across sampling time points.  
Review of the haematology , coagulation, clinical chemistry , and urinal ysis laboratory  values 
did not reveal an y unexpected findings within patients or an y trends across patients; there 
were no potentiall y clinically sig nificant haematology , clinical chemistry , or liver function test 
values reported.  No patients met Potential Hy ’s Law criteria.  Review of vital signs values 
and phy sical examination findings did not identify  any new safet y concerns.  There were no 
clinica lly significant changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs) reported.  The single IV dose of 
CAZ -AVI was well tolerated, with no new safet y concerns identified in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336291].

21(88)The risk considerations for this study  encompass the known and pot ential risks for CAZ- AVI 
and its component products avibactam and ceftazidime, as well as those risks associated with 
other treatments that may be administered as described in this protocol.  Other possible 
treatments include the marketed products metronid azole and meropenem.  As the risks for 
these marketed products are widel y available in their respective prescribing information, these 
risks will not be discussed within this section.
The risks for CAZ- AVI have not been fully  elucidated; however it is assu med that known or 
potential risks for CAZ -AVI should include those identified in the clinical studies with 
CAZ -
AVI, avibactam alone, and also for ceftazidime alone.  Additional risk information for 
avibactam and CAZ -AVI is located in the CAZ- AVI Investigat or’s Brochure.
The full risk profile for ceftazidime is described in the prescribing information for the product 
(refer to local ceftazidime product labelling).  Important risks as laid out in the warnings and 
precautions in product labelling for ceftazidi me include:
Hypersensitivity  reactions.  Though patients with hy persensitivity  and serious allergic 
reactions to cephalosporins, carbapenem or other β -lactam antibiotics are excluded 
from the trial, first -time epi[INVESTIGATOR_336292].
Antibi otic-associated diarrhoea, Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, colitis, and 
pseudomembranous colitis
Bacterial overgrowth with non- susceptible organisms
Distal necrosis as a result of inadvertent intra -arterial administration of ceftazidime
Elevated levels of ceftazidime used in patients with renal impairment have been 
associated with neurological sequelae such as tremors, my oclonus, seizures, 
encephalopath y, and coma
Potential risks for CAZ-AVI include the occurrence of events seen with ceftazidime alone, but
that go bey ond the frequency and/or severity  of those seen with ceftazidime.  L ocal 
intolerance has been seen in the preclinical studies, and has been monitored in the clinical 
programme.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_415471] al so been reported.  
In summary , the known and potential risks of receiving the developmental antibiotic 
combination CAZ -AVI are expected to be similar to those seen with ceftazidime and

22(88)cephalosporins in general.  Thus far, no unique risks have been identi fied for the avibactam 
component or the combination of CAZ-AVI.  The risks of the marketed antibiotics are 
considered acceptable.  Whilst it is anticipated that CAZ -AVI will have similar efficacy  for 
the treatment of cIAIs, it is possible that efficacy  will not be demonstrated.  For each patient in 
the trial, appropriate treatment of the cIAI is thus determined b y the clinical Investigator based 
on the clinical response of the patient.
1.4 Study design 
This study  will be a single blind, randomised, multi
-centr e, active controlled trial.  Patients 
aged from 3 months to less than 18 y ears with cIAI swill be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups (3:1 ratio): CAZ -AVI in combination with metronidazole versus meropenem.  Patients 
aged from 3 months to <1 year (Cohort 4b) must have been born at term (defined as 
gestational age ≥37weeks).
A sufficient number of patients are to be randomised 3:[ADDRESS_415472] 
72hours (3 full day s, ie, 9 doses) of study  treatment (ie, evaluable patients; at least [ADDRESS_415473] 20 patients in the meropenem group).
Patients will be allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts based on age.  R andomisation will be stratified as 
follows: 
Cohort 1: At least 15:5 evaluable patients aged from 12 y ears to < 18 years
Cohort 2: At least 15:5 evaluable patients aged from 6 y ears to <12 years
Cohort 3: No required minimum of evaluable patients aged from 2 years to <6 y ears
Cohort 4: 
No required minimum of evaluable patients aged from 3 months to <2 years, 
compris ing Cohorts 4a and 4b as follows:
Cohort 4a: P atients aged from 1 year to <2 years
Cohort 4b: Patients aged from 3 months to <1 year
Intravenous CAZ- AVI infusions will be given at doses based on age and weight

adjustment according to renal function as detailed in Table 5.
Patients whose CrCL  drops below 30 mL /min should be withdrawn from study  therapy .  
Patients withdrawing from study  therap y can b e administered alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_336281]’s choice, which should be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).  If possible, 
patients should still be followed for safet y (see Section 3.9.1).  Because the CrCl 
determination is only  an estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl is approaching 
thresholds that would require intervention such as a dose change or discont inuation of therapy  
(ie CrCL  approaching 50 or 30 mL /min) , the Investigator should use his or her discretion in

The suggested dosing regimen of m etronidazole is10mg/kg IV over 20 to 30 minutes 
every  
8hours (±30 minutes) , but it can also be prescribed/ adjusted by  [CONTACT_336325].  The metronidazole infusion will be started no later than 30 minutes after 
completion of the CAZ -AVI infusion. The dose/regimen of meropenem will be 20 mg/kg 
every  8hours (±1 hour) infused over approximately  15 to 30 minutes or up to 1 hour (or 
infusion duration as per local guidelines).  For patients weighing over 50 kg, the maximum 
dose of meropenem should not exceed 1 g every  8 hours.  
Patients will receive IV treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full day s, ie, 9 doses) before 
having the option to switch to an oral therap y, as specified in 
Section 7.7below.  The decision 
to switch to oral therap y is entirely  at the Investigator’s discretion, if the patient has good or 
sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.   The total period of 
treatment ( ie, IV drug and oral switch treatment) is to be between 7 and 15 day s.  Patients may  
remain on the IV stud y treatment for the full 7 to 15 days.
Patients will be assessed for safety  and efficacy  throughout the study , and blood samples will 
be taken for PK assessment.  The duration of each patient’s participation in the study  will be a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_415474] 
dose of an y treatment.

3.[ADDRESS_415482] enrolment and randomisation
Investigator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patients who entered 
pre-study  screening.  Patients will be enrolled if they  meet all the inclusion criteria, including 
informed consent and assent in writing from parent(s) or other legally -acceptable 
representative(s)/patient as applicable, and none of the exclusion criteria.  T he Blinded 
Observer may  perform screening and enrolment; however, the Investigator must perform 
randomisation. 
The Blinded Observer/Investigator will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent from the parent or guardian/legall y acceptable 
representative(s) of the p otential patient and informed assent from the potential 
patient (if age appropriate according to local regulations) before an y stud y specific 
procedures are performed
2. Assign potential patient a unique enrolment number, beginning with ‘E#’
3. Determine patient eligibility  (see Sections 
3.1and 3.2)
4. Investigator only : Assign eligible patient unique randomisation code (via an 
interactive voice/web response sy stem [IXRS] not available for access by  [CONTACT_336337])
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study , then his/her enrolment/rando misation

3.5 Methods for assigning treatme nt groups
Block randomisation using an IXRS will be used to assign patients in a ratio of 3:1 to the 
study  treatment groups of CAZ -AVI plus metronidazole or meropenem, respectively , in each 
of the cohorts for the age groups (see Section 8.2for a description of the sample size).
A representative of [COMPANY_008], under the supervision of [COMPANY_008] statistical personnel, 
will perform this randomisation .  
3.[ADDRESS_415484] 1 blinded Investigator (referred to as “Blinded Observer”
hereafter) will not know the patient’s treatment a ssignment and will conduct clinical 
assessments related to safety and efficacy .  The Blinded Observer may  perform screening and 
enrolment activities but will not be responsible for randomising patients (the Blinded 
Observer will not have access to the IXRS ).  The Blinded Observer will not ask other 
members of the study team, the patient, or the patient’s parent(s)/legall y acceptable 
representative(s) which study  treatment is being given, and will avoid all attempts to uncover 
treatment assignment.  The Blin ded Observer should arrange to see the patient during times 
when study  drug is NOT being administered, and not when assessments are being performed 
that could possibly  unblind the Blinded Observer, in order to maintain the blind.  I f possible, 
the same Bli nded Observer should complete all clinical assessments for a patient. The 
Blinded Observer should perform all causalit y assessments for all AEs and SAEs.

32(88)At each investigational site, an unblinded Investigator (referred to as “Investigator” hereafter), 
Pharmacist or designee, study  centre personnel, patient, and parent(s)/legally acceptable 
representative(s) may  be aware of which IV stud y drug therap y is being administered and 
shall be instructed not to reveal to the Blinded Observer which drug the patien t is receiving. 
Refer to Section 3.7if the Blinded Observer learns of the treatment assignment. 
3.7 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes , indicating the treatment randomisation for each randomised 
patient, will be available to the I nvestigator(s) or pharmacists from the IXRS.  Routines for 
this will be described in the IXRS user manual that will be provided to each centre.
This study  has a n observer -blinded design.  During the stud y, the Blinded Observer(s) will not 
make an y effort to determine which IV stud y drug is being administered.  The details of 
blinding will be described in the Blinding Plan.
Only  in the case of an emergency , when knowledge of the study  drug is essential for the 
immediate clinical management or welfare of a specific patient andthe Investigator or 
designee is not available to provide or cannot provide appropriate medical care t o the patient, 
may the Blinded Observer be unblinded to the patient’s treatment assignment.
Before an y unblinding of the Blinded Observer, it is strongl y advised to discuss options with 
the Medical Monitor or appropriate stud y personnel.  As soon as possib le, and without 
revealing the patient’s study  treatment assignment (unless important to the safet y of patients 
remaining in the stud y), the Blinded Observer or designee must notify PRA if the observer 
blind is broken for any reason and the Blinded Observer was unable to contact [CONTACT_336338].  PRA will inform [COMPANY_008] of the incident .

pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, and intravaginal devices, are not acceptable methods of birth control during this 
study  based on potential for antibiotics to alter gut flora, hormone absorption, and hormone 
effectiveness.  If an adolescent female stud y participant was previously using hormonal 
contraceptives such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches , and intravaginal devices, she should follow her health 
care provider’s specific recommendations for effective use of these methods after completing 
IV study  therapy .  Such recommendations may  address the need for a second method of 
contraception until th e hormonal method becomes fully  effective.

free to decide to discontinue the child’s use of IP or withdraw from the study  (ie, IP and 
assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient or the 
patient’s parent(s) or other legall y acceptable representative(s) who decides to discontinue I P 
will alway s be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of an y AEs.  If possible, they  will 
be seen and assessed b y an Investigator(s).  
Adverse events and SAEs will be followed up (See Section 6).  For pati ents who discontinue 
IP earl y, their follow -up assessments should be collected (see Section 6.3.2 for follow -up of 
unresolved AEs).  Liver CRF modules should be completed for patients discontinued after 
meeting hepatic/liver criteria.  The patient should be scheduled for the EOIV visit within 
24hours after IV stud y therap y discontinuation, ideally  before starting any new antibiotic 
treatment.
If a p atient is withdrawn from study , see

patients should have the reason for stud y withdrawal recorded as ‘Failed Eligibility  Criteria’ 
(ie, patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria).  This reason for stud y 
withdrawal is only  valid for screen failures (not randomised patients).
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients or the patient’s parent(s) or other legally  acceptable representative(s) are free to 
withdraw the child from the study  at any  time (IP and assessments), without prejudice to 
further treatment.
A patient or the patient’s parent(s) or other legally  acceptable representative (s) who withdraws 
consent will alway s be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any  AEs.  The 
Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study. 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisatio n 
code cannot be reused. 
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study  may  be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], trial patients are placed at 
undue risk because of clinically  significant findings that:
Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_336294] 
Are assessed as causall y related to stud y drug 
Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patients at the time of 
discontinuation of follo w-up must be recorded in the CRF.  All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented.
In terminating the study , the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests.

5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS
5.1 Efficacy assessments 
Clinical outcome, relapse, and emergent infections will be assessed b y the Blinded Observer 
at the time points specif
ied in Table 
1.  The Blinded Observer will assess clinical outcome, 
(including at LFU, assessment of patients for clinical relapse) and collection andreporting of 
AEs and SAEs from signing of the ICF (and Assent Form if applicable) until at least 30 days 
after an y dose of stud y drug ( IV or oral) or LFU. 
5.2 Microbiological assessments
Culture and organism identification should be performed at the local or regional laboratory , as 
applicable.  Susceptibility testing should be done at the local or regional laboratory  to support 
patient care.  All isolates should be sent to the central laboratory  for organism identification 
and susceptibility  testing.
Refer to the study -specific clinical and microbiology  laboratory  manual for specific 
procedures pertaining to the collection, processing, storage, and shipment of intra -abdominal 
fluid and blood culture samples or isolates.
5.2.1 Intra-
abdominal fluid for microbiologica l culture
Intra -abdominal fluid samples (such as tissue or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_336299]) should be obtained for culture at Baseline (preferably  before any  
antibiotics are administered) for all patients and at any  time until LFU, if clinically  indicated 
and performed as part of the patient’s regular medical care.  Baseline intra-abdominal fluid 
samples for culture must be obtained from the site of abdominal infection during surgical

46(88)intervention.  Intra -abdominal flu id samples should be collected onl y when collection of a 
sample is medically  feasible.   If a sample is collected, isolation of bacteria and susceptibility 
testing on identified bacteria should be done b y the local or regional laboratory per the 
laboratory ’
s standard processes. In cases where the number of potential pathogens seen in the 
initial culture is numerous, the local or regional laboratory  should follow standard processes in 
identify ing pathogens causing the intra- abdominal infection. All pathogen sprepared and 
evaluated should be sent to the central laboratory for reconfirmation.   
5.2.2 Blood samples for microbiological culture
If clinicall y indicated, blood samples (1 mL) may be obtained for culture at Baseline 
(preferabl y before an y antibiotics are a dministered) and at an y time until LFU.  
This protocol complies with European Union’s recommendations for blood loss associated 
with paediatric research ( European Commission 2008 ) and the World Health Organisation 
guidelines “Blood Sample Volumes in Child Health Research: Review of Safe Limits” 
(Howie 2011 ).  To minimise risk from blood loss associated with this study , standard of care 
laboratory  results will be used whenever possible.  I n addition, paediatric blood collection 
tubes will be used and capi[INVESTIGATOR_336300].  PK samples will be collected from patients unless deemed unsafe due to the risk 
from additional blood loss (per the Investigator’s judgment).
5.3 Safety assessments
5.3.1 Laboratory safety assessments
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry , haematology , and urinal ysis 
will be taken at the times indicated in Table 1.
The following laboratory variables will be measured:

48(88)The Direct Coombs test is required at Baseline and TOC only . 
The Investigator should make an assessment of the available results with regard to clinicall y 
relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory  results should be signed and dated and retained at 
centre as source data for laboratory  variables.  For information on how AEs based on 
laboratory  tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 
6.3.
NB. If a patient shows an AST orALT ≥3×ULN ortotal bilirubin ≥2×ULN please refer to 
Appendix D for further instructions.
Creatinine clearance will be measured at Baseline and at each time that serum cre atinine is 
being assessed as part of the clinical chemistry  panel using the child’s measured height 
(length) and serum creatinine within the updated “bedside” Schwartz formula ( Schwartz et al 
2009
). It is recommended that serum creatinine, and therefore CrCl obtained using the 
Schwartz bedside formula, are assessed at additional time points if the I nvestigator deems that 
the test is required for the sa fety of the patient, based on previous results and the patient’s 
clinical condition, and if the additional test(s) does not exceed the maximum volume of blood 
allowed per protocol.  The Investigator should also consider the balance of the risk and benefit 
of taking additional samples when making the decision.  I f a biochemistry  panel is requested 
and serum creatinine can be added and evaluated without increasing the volume of blood 
allowed per protocol, the site should record the result in the CRF.   Note: measurement of 
height is not required at each point that CrCl is estimated : 
CrCl (mL/min/1.73m2)=0.413×height (length) (cm)/serum creatinine (mg/dL)
If there is a significant reduction (according to the Investigator) in a patient’s estimated CrCl 
during t he treatment period, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_336343]
.
5.3.2 Physical examination 
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed and will include an assessment of the 
following: general appearance, skin, head and neck  (incl uding ears, ey es, nose and throat), 
lymph nodes, thy roid, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , cardiovascular, abdomen, musculoskeletal (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_336301]) and neurological s ystems . Height and weight will be measured at Baseline 
only.  Weight may  be measured at subsequent time points if clinically  indicated and feasible .  
Body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) will be calculated as the ratio of weight in kg/(height in 
cm/100)2.  BMI will only be calculated at Baseline (Day  -1/Day 1).  BMI will not be 
calculated for children <2years of age (Cohort s 4a and 4b ) as BMI is not considered a 
screening tool for healthy weight in children <2 years of age.  Tanner staging of development 
(refer to 
Appendix E for further details on Tanner staging) will be assessed at Baseline only  
(Day  -1/Day 1) for females who have not reached menarche but may  reasonably  have the 
potential to become pregnant.

can be s ymptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachy cardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory  findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at an y time, including run -in or 
washout periods, even if no study  treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.
6.2 Definition of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during an y study phase (ie, run- in, treatment, washout, 
follow -up), that fulfils 1 or more of the following criteria:
Results in death
Is immediatel y life -threatening
Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]

ability  to conduct normal life functions
Is a congenital abnormality  or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may  jeopardise the patient or may  require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B.
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1
Time period for collection of adverse events
Non-serious AEs and SAEs will be collected for each patient from the time of signature [CONTACT_86220]/assent until the L FU visit ( 27 to 50 day s after start of study  treatment) .
6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study  are followed up 
by [CONTACT_336345] y indicated.  [COMPANY_008] and its 
representatives retain the right to request additional information for an y patient
with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary .
6.3.3 Variables 
The following variables will be collected for each AE:
AE (verbatim)
Date and time when the AE started and stopped
Maximum intensity
Whether the AE is seriou s or not
Blinded Observer causality  rating against the IV study  therapy  (yes or no) and against 
metronidazole (y es or no)
Action taken with regard to I V study  therapy
Outcome of AE
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:
Onset Date (date AE met criteria for serious AE)
Detection date (date Investigator became aware of serious AE)

Blinded Observer c ausality  assessment in relation to study  procedures (y es/no)
Blinded Observer c ausality  assessment in relation to other medication (y es/no)
Description of AE
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of
intensity  whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_29967].  An AE of severe intensit y need 
not necessaril y be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may  
be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a 
limited degree of disability  may  be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE.  The 
Blinded Observer should provide an assessment of the severit y of each AE/SAE.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Blinded Observer will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer 
‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
event may  have been caused by  [CONTACT_7198]?’

Date 07 March 2017
55(88)For SAEs , the Blinded Observer will also asses scausal relationship for other medication and 
study  procedures and additional study  drug.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with 
any study  procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘y es’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y que stion is found in Appendix B
.
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_336346]: ‘Have you/the child had any health problems since
the previous visit/you were last asked?’ , or revealed by  [CONTACT_336347].  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when 
possible) to recording a list of signs and s ymptoms.  However, if a diagnos is is known and 
there are other signs or symptoms that are not generall y part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis 
and each sign or s ymptom will be recorded separately .
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol -mandated laboratory tests and vital sign measurements will be 
summarised in the CSR.  Deterioration as compared to Day  1 (Baseline) in protocol -mandated 
laboratory  values, vital signs, ECGs, and other safety  assessments should therefore onl y be 
reported as AEs if they  fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of 
treatment with the IV study  therapy .
If deterioration in a laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or s ymptom will be reported as an AE and th e associated laboratory  result 
or vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible, the reporting 
Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low 
haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clin ical signs or sy mptoms, clinically  relevant 
deteriorations in non -mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deterioration of a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally  due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE or SAE (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Any new or aggravated clinically  relevant abnormal medical finding at a phy sical examination 
as compared with the screening assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Actions required in cases of increases in liver chemistry values
The Investigator is responsible for, without delay , determining whether the patient meets 
potential Hy ’s law criteria; AST or ALT ≥3×ULN andtotal bilirubin ≥2×ULN irrespective of 
the value of the patient’s alkaline phosphatase, at any  point during the study following the 
start of study medication.
A Hy ’s Law case is defined as study  patient with an increase in serum AST or ALT 
≥3×ULN 
together with total bilirubin ≥2×ULN, where no other reason can be found to explain the 
combination of increases, eg, elevated serum ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, or 
another drug.

Date 07 March 2017
56(88)For potential Hy ’s Law and Hy ’s Law the elevation in transaminases mu st precede or be 
coincident with (ie, on the same day ) the elevation in total bilirubin, but there is no specified 
timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and total bilirubin must occur.  
Details regarding the actions required in the cases of increases in ALT, AST, and total 
bilirubin can be found in 
Appendix D.
If a patient reaches an ALT or AST=5×ULN, the patient may  continue with the I P as planned 
unless discontinuation criteria as described in Section 3.10 are met.  The patient should be 
seen within 48 hours to instigate enhanced follow -up and monitoring.  Enhanced follow -up 
should include collection of clinical and historical information to determine the cause of ALT 
and/or AST elevations.  Additional testing for liver laboratory  test results must be done every  
48 hours until the peak value has been reached as documented by  a decline in the values
and/or until the patient is feeling better.  The frequency  of retesting can decrease to once per 
week or less if abnormalities stabilise or study  drug has been discontinued and the patient is 
asymptomatic.  The patient should be followed until resolution (including laboratory  testing).
6.3.[ADDRESS_415514] adverse event collection
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Effect
Where there is deterioration in the condition for which the IV study  therap y is being used, 
there may  be uncertainty  as to whether this is lack of efficacy , disease progression, and 
whether it constitutes an AE.  In such cases, unless the [COMPANY_008] or reporting ph ysician 
considers that the IV study therapy contributed to the deterioration or local regulations state 
the contrary , the deterioration should be considered to be lack of efficacy  and not an AE.
Insufficient therapeutic effect will be captured as an efficacy  outcome.  Instances of, or 
discontinuation due to insufficient therapeutic effect (ie, lack of efficacy ) should not be 
collected as AEs.  A clinic al failure should not be recorded as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Disease progression
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which CAZ- AVI is being studied.  It may  be an increase in the severit y of the 
disease under stud y and/or increases in the s ymptoms of the disease.  Expected progression of 
the disease under study  and/or expected progression of signs and s ymptoms of the disease 
under study , unless more severe in intensit y or more frequent than expected f or the patient’s 
condition, should not be reported as an AE.  An y event or extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336307] y due to disease progression must not be reported as an SAE unless it is believed 
that I V study  therapy  actively  contributed to the prog ression of the disease (ie, not by  [CONTACT_336348]).  Events that are unequivocall y due to disease progression 
should not be reported as an AE during the stud y.

An overdose without associated s ymptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF 
module.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] IV study  therapy  occurs in the course of the study , 
then I nvestigators or other study  centre personnel will inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] 
representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately  but no later than the end of the next 
business day  from when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the I nvestigator to ensure that 
all relevant information is provide d to the [COMPANY_008] patient safet y data entry site.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, standard reporting time lines appl y, see

of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy , normal 
birth or congenital abn ormality ) should be followed up and documented even if the patient 
was discontinued from the study .
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel

There is no restriction on fathering children or donating sperm during the study .  Pregnancy  of 
the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy , normal birth, or congenital 
abnormality ) should if possible be followed up and documented.  The outcome of an y 
conception occurring from the date of the firs t IP administration until [ADDRESS_415519] included 
tremors, my

will be familiarised with AEs and SAEs likely  to occur in this patient population, based on 
experience in adults and adolescents, as well as with this class of drugs (cephalosporins).  The 
DSMB will conduct pre -planned and possibly  ad hoc reviews of accumulating data.
Based on the findings of these reviews, the DSMB may make recommendations to 
[COMPANY_008] regarding the study , including, but not limited to: continue the study without 
modification, modify  the protocol or inf ormed consent/assent document(s), or temporaril y 
stop enrolment in all or some of the study  centres.  [COMPANY_008] will be responsible for 
discussing and, if considered appropriate, implementing the DSMB recommendations.

Date 07 March 2017
63(88)Full details of infusion prepa ration are given in the Pharmacy  Manual.
Patients whose CrCl changes during treatment should receive the appropriate dose reduction 
or increase according to Table 5.
The Investigator should follow the package insert for meropenem for dose modifications 
associated with renal impairment.
Patients whose CrCL  drops below 30 mL /min should be withdrawn from study  therapy .  
Patients withdrawing from study  therap y can be administered alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_336281]’s choice, which should be recorded in the CRF .  If possible, patients should still 
be followed for safety (see 
Section 3.9.1).  Because the CrCl determination is only  an estimate 
of renal function, in instances where the CrCl is approaching thresholds that would require 
intervention such as a dose cha nge or discontinuation of therapy  (ie CrCL approaching 50 or 
30 mL /min) , the Investigator should use his or her discretion in determining (ie confirming the 
value b y repeat testing, if feasible) whether an immediate dose change, a short period of 
continued observation, or discontinuation of therapy  is warranted. If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_336308] a clinically  significant reduction in a patient’s estimated CrCl during the 
treatment period, then the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_336324] (immediate dose change, a short period of continued observation, or 
discontinuation of therapy ). Additionally , in instances of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_336282], the 
Investigator should increase the frequency  of CrCl monitoring, depending on the patient’s 
clinical status, extent of renal function change and I nvestigator’s clinical evaluation.
The suggested dosing regimen of m etronidazole is10mg/kg IV over 20 to 30 minutes every  
8hours 
(±30 minutes), but it can also beprescribed/adjusted by  [CONTACT_336325]. The metronidazole infusion will be started no later than 30 minutes after 
completion of the CAZ -AVI infusion.  
The dose/regimen of meropenem will be 20 mg/kg every  8hours (±1hour) infused over 
approximately  15 to 30 minutes or up to 1 hour ( or infusion duration as per local guidelines
).  
For patients weighing over 50 kg, the maximum dose of meropenem should not exceed 1 g 
every  8 hours.  The time interval between the beginning of r econstitution and the end of the 
infusion should not exceed 1 hour due to the stability  of meropenem when reconstituted with 
sodium chloride. 
7.3 Labelling
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice and local regulatory  
guidelines.  
Label text will be translated into the local language.
Personnel at the study  centre will prepare and label the individual I V infusions as assigned by  
[CONTACT_4150], and according to the handling instructions.

storage conditions will be stated on the stud y drug labelling and in the handling instructions.
7.5 Compliance
The site will monitor patient compliance, which will be documented in the patient’s source 
documents, and relevant data will be reported in the CRF.  To ensure that the patient is 
compliant with administration of study  drug, oral switch therapy , and stud y procedures, the 
date and dose of the medication should be recorded in the appropriate section s of the CRF.  
7.6 Accountability
The study  drug provided for this study  will be used only  as directed in the study  protocol.
The study  personnel will account for all study  drugs dispensed to and returned from the 
patient.
Study  site personnel, if applicable, or the PRA monitor will account for all study  drugs 
received at the site, unused study  drugs and for appropriate destruction.  Certificates of 
delivery , destruction, and return should be signed.  For general drug destruction (eg, left over 
drug at site), accepted practices for destruction within specific sites, countries, or regions 
should be used, through PRA’s standard operating procedures (SOPs).  Therefore, where at all 
possible the I P should be destroy ed locall y at site and a third part y supplier for return and 
destruction should only
 be used where specific country  regulations or local procedures state 
this is not possible. Documentation should be provided by [CONTACT_336351]’s Research 
and Development Procurement Manager identify ing that this is the case. For I P associated 
with a recall, [COMPANY_008] will determine what is to be destro yed, but PRA will manage the 
execution of destruction using standards acceptable to [COMPANY_008] or its representative.
7.7 Oral switch therapy
The choice of oral switch ther apy, among the options listed below, should be in line with the 
approved and marketed drugs in the respective country , and should observe the local speci fic 
regulations and local therapeutic guidelines (if existent), regarding posology.  The decision to 
switch to oral therap y is entirely at the Investigator’s discretion, if the patient has good or 
sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.
For the optional oral switch therap y, the following should be given: 
Oral amoxi cillin/clavulanic acid ( only in countries where its use for children is 
permitted; according to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per 
standard of care), or
Oral ciprofloxacin ( only in countries where its use for children is permitted ; according 
to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care) plus 
metronidazole (administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or

7.8 Concomitant and other treatments 
All prescription and over -the-counter medications being taken by  [CONTACT_336352] 2 weeks 
prior to stud y entr y (considered prior treatment) and from randomisation through the LFU 
visit (considered concomitant treatment) must be documented on the appropriate pages of the 
CRF.  Sy stemic antibiotics should be documented for the entire duration of the study  (from 
2weeks prior to stud y entry through the LFU visit).  For patients who are being breast fed, all 
medications taken b y the lactating mother in the previous [ADDRESS_415524] dose of 
study  therapy  until LFU will also be recorded.
If Enterococcus species or methicillin -resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the 
pathogens suspected or isolated and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], specific therap y is 
indicated, then open -label vancomy cin, linezolid, or daptomy cin may  be added to either of the 
study  regimens according to the usual practice of the I nvestigator.  If vancomy cin, linezolid, 
or daptomy cin are started empi[INVESTIGATOR_336310], and if final 
culture results did not isolate MRSA or Enterococcus species, then the Investigator should 
discontinue the additional Gram -positive coverage that was empi[INVESTIGATOR_60519] y added.

Other medication, which is considered necessary  for the patient’s safet y and well -being, may  
be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the 
CRF.  If analgesic medications are needed for pain, the use of analgesic medication without 
antipy retic properties is preferred.  Should a patient require immunosuppressive agents or 
chemotherap y after being randomised to IV study  therap y, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_336354] (as an [COMPANY_008] delegate) before initiating therapy.  Continued 
patient study  participation will be determined based upon assessment of the sa fety risk to the 
patient if he or she were to continue in the study .  Patients who have completed IV study

66(88)therap y and are in the follow -up (FU) period should remain in the study  as they  are not 
activel y on IV stud y therapy but being followed for outcomes.
Simultaneous administration of meropenem and/or metronidazole with warfarin may  augment 
its anticoagulant effects.  There have been man y reports of increases in the anticoagulant 
effects of orall y administered anticoagulant agents, including warfarin, in patients who are 
concomitantly  receiving antibacterial agents.  The risk may  vary  with the underly ing infection, 
age, and general status of the patient so that the contribution of the antibiotic to the increase in 
international normalised ratio (INR) is di fficult to assess.  In addition to the standard study  
safet y laboratory  assessments, frequent monitoring of the INR should be performed during 
and shortly  after co -administration of study  therapy  with an oral anticoagulant agent, as per 
local practice.  
In vitro, avibactam is a substrate of organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and OAT3, which 
might contribute to the active uptake from the blood compartment and, thereb y its 
excretion. Probenecid (a potent OAT inhibitor) inhibits this uptake by  55% to 70% in v itro 
and, therefore, has the potential to alter the elimination of avibactam when co -dosed.  Since a 
clinical interaction stud y of avibactam and probenecid has not been conducted, co -dosing of 
avibactam with probenecid is not recommended.  Probenecid interferes with the active tubular 
secretion of meropenem, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem.  
Therefore, co -
administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended.  There is 
significant drug -drug interaction between meropenem and valproic acid or sodium valproate; 
therefore co -administration of meropenem and valproic acid or sodium valproate should be 
avoided.
A number of unfavourable reactions with other drugs are known for ceftazidime.  
Contraindications and known drug interact ions for ceftazidime are summarised in Table 6.

67(88)Table 6 Contraindications and drug -drug interactions
Ceftazidime Concurrent administration with chloramphenicol should be avoided.  Chloramphenicol has been shown to be 
antagonistic to β -lactam antibiotics, including ceftazidime.
Concurrent administration with aminoglycoside antibiotics or potent diuretics s uch as furosemide may result in 
nephrotoxicity.  Because of potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycosidic antibiotics, renal function 
should be carefully monitored, especially if higher dosages of aminoglycosides are to be administered or if therapy is 
prolonged.
Concurrent administration with combined oral oestrogen/progesterone contraceptives may result in lower oestrogen 
reabsorption and reduced efficacy of these contraceptives secondary to the effects of ceftazidime on gut flora.

68(88)Ciproflo xacin Administration in pregnant or lactating women is contraindicated.
Concurrent administration with tizanidine is contraindicated.
Concurrent administration with methotrexate is not recommended; methotrexate may inhibit renal tubular transport 
of ciprofloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate and increased risk of methotrexate -
associated toxic reactions.
Concurrent administration with theophylline decreases theophylline clearance, resulting in elevated serum 
theophylline levels and increased risk of a patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_336312].
Concurrent administration with caffeine or pentoxifylline (oxpentifylline) may raise serum concentrations of these 
xanthine derivatives.
Concurrent adm inistration with antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminium hydroxide may reduce the 
bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by [CONTACT_45848] 90%.
Concurrent administration with probenecid interferes with renal secretion of ciprofloxacin and increases 
ciprofloxacin serum concentrations.
Concurrent administration with phenytoin may result in increased or reduced serum levels of phenytoin; monitoring 
of drug levels is recommended.
Concurrent administration with warfarin may augment its anticoagulant effects. The risk may vary with the 
underlying infection, age, and general status of the patient so that the contribution of a fluoroquinolone to an 
increased INR is difficult to assess.  It is recommended that INR be monitored frequently during and shortly after 
co-administration of ciprofloxacin with an oral anticoagulant agent.
Concurrent administration with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_336313] 
60%.  Monitoring of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_11122]- related side effects and dose adjustment as appropriate is recommended during and 
shortly after co- administration with ciprofloxacin.
Concurrent administration with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_336314] N -desmethylclozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], a 
metabolite, by [CONTACT_45848] 29% and 31%, respectively.   Clinical surveillance and appropriate adjustment of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_336315] -administration with ciprofloxacin are recommended.

69(88)Amoxicillin -
clavulanic acidConcurrent administration with probenecid decreases the renal tubular secreti on of amoxicillin but does not delay 
renal excretion of clavulanic acid.  Concurrent use with amoxicillin -clavulanic acid may result in increased and 
prolonged blood concentrations of amoxicillin.  Co -administration of probenecid is not recommended.
Concur rent administration of amoxicillin with oral anticoagulants may result in abnormal prolongation of 
prothrombin time (increased INR).  Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are 
prescribed concurrently with amoxicillin -clavulanic ac id.  Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be 
necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.
Concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both 
drugs as compared t o patients receiving amoxicillin alone.
Concurrent administration of oral contraceptives and amoxicillin -clavulanic acid may affect intestinal flora, leading 
to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contrac eptives.
High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may result in false- positive reactions when testing for the presence of 
glucose in urine using Clinitest®, Benedict's solution, or Fehling's solution.  Since this effect may also occur with 
amoxicillin- clavulanic acid, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be 
used.
Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total 
conjugated estriol, estriol -glucuronide , conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.

70(88)Meropenem No specific medicinal product interaction studies other than probenecid have been conducted.
Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of 
meropenem with the effect of increasing the elimination half -life and plasma concentration of meropenem.  Caution 
is required if probenecid is co -administered with meropenem.
The potential effect of meropenem on the protein binding of other me dicinal products or metabolism has not been 
studied.  However, the protein binding is so low that no interactions with other compounds would be expected on the 
basis of this mechanism.
Decreases in blood levels of valproic acid have been reported when it i s co-administered with carb apenem agents 
resulting in a 60 to 100 % decrease in valproic acid levels in about 2days. Due to the rapid onset and the extent of 
the decrease, co -administration of valproic acid/sodium valproate/valpromide with carbapenem age nts is not 
considered to be manageable and therefore should be avoided.
Oral anti coagulants
Simultaneous administration of antibiotics wit h warfarin may augment its anti coagulant effects. There have been 
many r eports of increases in the anti coagulant effects of orally administered anti coagulant agents, including warfarin 
in patients who are concomitantly receiving antibacterial agents. The risk may vary with the underlying infection, 
age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of the an tibiotic to the increase in INR is difficult to 
assess. It is recommended that the INR should be monitored frequently during and shortly after co -administration o f 
antibiotics with an oral anti coagulant agent.

2(3)FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject ’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336322] a serious AE
, although the reasons 
for it ma y be (eg, bronchospasm, lary ngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a stud y are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study , provided that it did not dete riorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may  not be immediately  life threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], disability  or incapacit y but may  jeopardize the subject or may  require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  
These should usually  be considered as serious.
Simply  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
Examples of such events are:
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hy drocortisone 
treatment
 Hepatotoxic ity caused b y paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatment with N -acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood d yscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]
 Development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

3(3)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CA[LOCATION_003]LITY QUESTION
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibility ” that an AE may  have been caused by  [CONTACT_33641].
 Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actuall y received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
 Consistency  with known drug profile.  W as the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology  and toxicology ) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties?
 Dechallenge experience.  Did the AE resolve o r improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
 No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained b y another aetiology 
such as the underly ing disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
 Rechallenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally  recommend or support 
a rechallenge.
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship?
A “re asonable possibility” could be considered to exist for an AE where one or more of these 
factors exist.
In contrast, there would not be a “reasonable possibility ” of causality  if none of the above 
criteria apply  or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course but an y 
dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause of 
the AE.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug?
 Is ther e a known mechanism?
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibility ” of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this.  Causal relationship in 
cases where the disease under study  has deteriorated du e to lack of effect should be classified 
as no reasonable possibility .

2(3)LABELLING AND SHIPME NT OF BIOHAZARD SAMP LES
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 
3categories (http://www .iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substance
s.htm ). For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition 
(2005).  Infectiou s substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category  B or Exempt.  
There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability , life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy  humans or animals.  Category  A pathogens are eg, Ebola, L assa fever virus:
 are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.
Category B I nfectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category  A.  Category  B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) t ypes 1 and 2.  They  are assigned the following UN 
number and proper shippi[INVESTIGATOR_72919]:
 UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
 are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens
 Clinical trial samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulations
 Clinical trial samples will routinely  be packed and transported at ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(http://www. iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.
htm)
 Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry -ice content
 IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done b y an IATA certified person, as 
applicable

3(6)1. INTRODUCTION
During the course of the study  the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver
biochemistry .  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potential Hy ’s Law (PHL) criteria at an y point during the stud y.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review an d assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy ’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_336367] (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with sta ndard safet y reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper L imit of 
Normal (ULN) and Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN irrespective of an increase in Alkaline 
Phosphatase (ALP), at any  point during the study  following the start of study  medication.  The 
elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a specified time frame.
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT 
≥ 3x UL N andTBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can 
be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, 
viral hepatitis, another drug.  The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a 
specified time frame.
For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the 
same day ) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
3. IDENTIFICATION OF PO TENTIAL HY’S LAW CAS ES
In order to identify  cases of PHL  it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laborat ory data for any  patient who meets any  of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
 ALT ≥ 3xULN
090177e18e51c7a8\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:09-May-2018 14:11 (GMT)

Edition Number 1
Date 20 January 2015
4(6) AST ≥ 3xUL N
 TBL ≥ 2xUL N
When the identification criteria are met from laboratory  results the Investigator will without 
delay :
 Determ ine whether the patient meets PHL  criteria (see Section 2of this Appendix 
for definition) b y reviewing laboratory  reports from all previous visits (including 
both central and local laboratory  results)
The Inves tigator will without delay  review each new laboratory  report and if the identification 
criteria are met will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL  criteria (see 
Section 2of this Appendix 
for definition) b y reviewing laboratory  reports from all previous visits
 Promptly  enter the laboratory  data into the laboratory  CRF
4. FOLLOW-UP
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL  criteria the Investigator w ill:
 Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory  results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study  Protocol.
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL  criteria the Investigator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative wh o will then inform the central Study  Team 
The Study  Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the stud y patients’ follow -up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_737] w ill:
 Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically  
indicated 
 Investigate the etiology  of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study  Physician

5(6) Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
 If at an y time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures
5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMEN T OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than [ADDRESS_415538] and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequentl y 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CR F
 If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingl y and follow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the AL T or AST 
and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Report an SA E (report term ‘Hy ’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
The ‘Medically  Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘relate d’ should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay , of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary  to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an
informed decision can be made:

6(6) Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy ’s Law’) apply ing serious criteria and 
causality  assessment as per above
 Continue follow -up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the 
outcome of the review

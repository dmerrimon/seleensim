NUMBER OF SITES 1
RATIONALE Multiple sclerosis  (MS)  is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_685673] 3 times more women  than men 
and, in 90%  cases,  women  before the age of 50, i.e. prior to menopause. 
Given evidence  for hormonal regulation of  MS, a symptomatic worsening of MS 
symptoms at menopause due to hot flashes and other phenomena, as well  as 
recent data  suggesting that MS disease severity may worsen after menopause, we 
propose to pi[INVESTIGATOR_685649]-menopausal women.  
Increasing evidence  suggests  that estrogen is  neuroprotective, and that  hormonal 
modulation after menopause may be an important strategy to combat cognitive  
decline. 
Given the potential complications of hormone replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (HT), tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC)s have been developed to combine the beneficial effects of estrogen with the tissue-specific agonistic and antagonistic properties  of selective estrogen  receptor modulators (SERMs). 
Here, we  propose a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_516535]-center randomized double blind placebo  
controlled trial to investigate the  effectiveness of  the TSEC Duavee (conjugated 
estrogen +  SERM bazedoxifene), vs.  placebo, for 8 weeks on (1) tolerability,  (2) 
patient-reported symptoms  (menopausal: hot flashes, sleep, cognition) and  (3) 
MS-related safety (MS  symptoms, MRI). 
Our team consists of experts in MS  translational  research, and hormonal  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
STUDY DESIGN A pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 2-month, double blind, 1:[ADDRESS_929473] of a tissue-selective estrogen modulator  (TSEC) (Duavee, 
which is FDA approved for the treatment of menopausal  symptoms in women in 
the general population)  on tolerability  and menopausal  symptoms in 
perimenopausal women with MS.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
To test the hypothesis that a  TSEC (CE+BZA) will be well tolerated in women 
with MS,  and will alleviate  their menopausal symptoms.  In relieving hot flashes  
and subsequent sleep and mood disruption, MS symptoms will also be 
ameliorated.
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES
 - To explore the hypothesis that CE+BZA  improves  menopausal symptoms in 
MS women.
- To explore the hypothesis that CE+BZA  results in improvement in MS-related 
outcomes.
- To explore the hypothesis that CE+BZA  for 8 weeks is tolerable in women 
with MS.

STATISTICS
Primary Analysis PlanWe will perform t-tests comparing the absolute changes  in outcomes from the  
baseline to the 2-month visit  in the two treatment groups.
Aim 1. Effect  of CE+BZA on menopausal  symptoms.  The primary  measure will 
be the daily  number of hot flashes averaged over 3 days (daily  diary),  and the  
secondary measure will be  sleep quality (ISI  questionnaire).
Aim 2. Effect  of CE+BZA on MS outcomes. The primary measure will be the  
MS Rating  Scale  (MSRS) global score,  and the secondary  measure will be the  
SF36 PCS (physical component score). Exploratory  measures will include  
corpus callosum tract integrity on DTI,  cognitive function (SDMT), and other  
QOL outcomes (MFIS,  SF36  sub-scales,  depression scale).
Aim 3. Tolerability of CE+BZA. The primary measure will be  the percentage of 
subjects reporting side  effects on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for 
Medications (TSQM) global score,  and the  MS-specific secondary  measure  will 
be the number of new  or enhancing lesions on MRI.
Rationale for Number of Subjects
Given this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will view the study  as a success if the  observed 
mean change in the  treatment group  is larger by [CONTACT_685675]  (“play the  winner” approach). In  healthy women treated with 
estradiol for 8 weeks,( Joffe et al., 2014) VMS  decreased by 2.[ADDRESS_929476] 80% power to find the  
treatment arm mean difference to be  larger with our  proposed sample  size.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 1 BACKGROUND
Menopause in MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS)  affects 3 times more women than  men, and before age 
50 in about 90% cases, i.e.  prior to menopause (Bove  et al., 2012). There is broad  evidence  for 
hormonal regulation of MS in animal models (Gold  & Voskuhl, 2009) and in clinical cohorts (e.g. 
pregnancy (Bove & Chitnis, 2014)).
Around menopause, many  clinical patients report symptom worsening associated with hot flashes, 
sleep disturbance or mood changes. Longer-term,  an age-related decline in gonadal  steroids might 
represent one sex-specific influence (Clayton & Collins, 2014) on the known age-related increases in disability and conversion to progressive  course  (Tutuncu et al.,  2013), which is marked by 
[CONTACT_685676].  Recent data suggest that MS disease  
severity may worsen after  menopause (Bove & al.,  2014; Bove et al.,  2015).
Hormone therapy (HT). In healthy women, after the  abrupt  decline  in estradiol  occurring with 
early oophorectomy, there is an increased  risk for cognitive decline  and dementia (Coppus et al., 
2010; Corbo et al.,  2011; Henderson & Sherwin, 2007; Phung et  al., 2010; Rocca et al.,  2007; 
Vearncombe & Pachana,  2009;  Zhou et al., 2011) and gray  matter (GM) loss in functionally 
important regions (e.g. hippocampus)(Goto et al., 2011). HT, when  taken  within a perimenopausal 
“window of opportunity” (5  years),  may  protect against  neurodegeneration, (Bove et  al., 2014b; 
Henderson, 2013; Rocca et  al., 2011; Shao et al., 2012) perhaps due to sparing  effects on regional  
GM atrophy  (Boccardi et  al., 2006; Lord et al.,  2010; Robertson et  al., 2009). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_685651]  (menopausal symptoms, bone density), very  few women (<30% of  our 
cohort) are currently  taking  HT for menopausal  symptoms; this is a result  of risks such as (1) 
breast and endometrial cancer, and (2) stroke in older  women in the Women’s Health  Initiative  
(NAMS; Langer et  al., 2012; Rapp et al., 2003). 
INNOVATION: To date, there are  no objective assessments of the  impact  of HT on MS disease 
course. In  an initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_685652], we plan to investigate the  
tolerability of Duavee in treating  menopausal symptoms in women with MS.
Our treatment, Duavee, has been  approved  by [CONTACT_685677]:
1.    Treatment of  moderate to severe vasomotor  symptoms associated with menopause
2.    Prevention  of postmenopausal osteoporosis
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfdadocs/label/2006/004782s147lbl.pdf)
Duavee is commercially available.
1.1 Overview of Non-Clinical Studies
SERMs in MS animal models. 
Estrogen receptor (ER) α and β and  membrane  (m)ERs  are present on oligodendrocyte lineage 
cells. In an animal model  of MS, experimental  autoimmune encephalomyelitis  (EAE),  SERMs 
have been explored for their potential in stimulating endogenous myelination and  sparing axonal  
degeneration. Bebo et  al found that both tamoxifen  and raloxifene (two commercially available 
SERMs) suppressed myelin antigen  specific T-cell proliferation, with tamoxifen being  more 
effective. Tamoxifen treatment reduced  the induction  of major histocompatibility  complex II by 
[CONTACT_685678],  MD
Protocol 15-[ZIP_CODE] Confidential
Version #: 1 Version Date: 12/16/2015 Page 11 of 41
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 lipopolysaccharide stimulated dendritic  cells and decreased their ability to activate myelin  specific 
T-cells. At lower doses, tamoxifen also increased  the levels of Th2  transcription  factors and 
induced a Th2  bias in cultures of myelin-specific  splenocytes. EAE symptoms and the  degree of 
demyelination were less severe in mice treated with tamoxifen than in control mice.1 
In subsequent work, the estrogen receptor (ER) β ligand 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propi[INVESTIGATOR_685653] (DPN) has  been  found  to reduce clinical  disease, be neuroprotective, stimulate endogenous 
myelination, and improve  axon conduction without altering peripheral cytokine  production or 
reducing central  nervous  system (CNS) inflammation. Both prophylactic and  therapeutic 
treatments with DPN during EAE were found to improve remyelination-induced axon  conduction, 
suggesting adirect effect  of treatment on oligodendrocytes. DPN treatment of EAE  animals 
resulted in phosphorylated ERβ and activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine-specific protein  kinase (Akt)/mammalian target  of rapamycin  (mTOR) signaling 
pathway, a pathway required  for oligodendrocyte  survival and axon  myelination.[ADDRESS_929477]  that SERMs may exert beneficial  effects  on neuroprotection through  ER-beta  
modulation.
1.2 Overview of  Clinical Studies
HT: What is the evidence?  
Hormone therapy (HT) during menopause  is an area of active inquiry. HT typi[INVESTIGATOR_685654] (ET) or combined estrogen-protestogen  (EPT) therapy, either administered  orally  
(ET and EPT), vaginally (ET) or transdermally (low dose  estrogen). While HT has been proven  to 
alleviate many menopausal symptoms, it is  also associated with risks.[68] Currently, the  North 
American Menopause  Society (NAMS) recommends individualized HT treatment based  on a  
patient’s risk profile, for the  shortest possible duration and at the  lowest possible dose.[68] 
General benefits and Risks. 
Benefits. According to the NAMS [ADDRESS_929478] effective  treatment 
for menopause-related  vasomotor symptoms  (ET with or  without progestogen) and for moderate 
to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (local vaginal  ET, systemic HT). Additionally,  
P HT is effective against overactive  bladder  (local ET; systemic HT  may provoke  or worsen stress 
incontinence), reduces  the risk of recurrent UTIs  (vaginal ET), improves  health-related quality of 
life (HQOL) in symptomatic  menopausal women, and  may reduce the  diagnosis of new onset type  
2 diabetes mellitus. At low doses,  HT maintains  or improves bone mass density (BMD) and  at 
standard doses, reduces postmenopausal osteoporotic fractures even in women  without 
osteoporosis. Additionally,  in observational studies at least, HT was associated with lower risks  of 
venous thromboembolism  and stroke (transdermal  and low-dose ET). There is to date no report  of 
significant improvement in libido  associated  with HT,  although low dose local  ET may improve 
vaginal symptoms  such  as lubrication,  blood flow and sensation.[68]  
Risks: Unopposed systemic  ET in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus is associated with 
increased endometrial  cancer risk; concomittant  progestogen is therefore recommended. In  
addition, EPT initiated  close to the onset of  menopause  may be associated be  an increased risk of 
breast cancer; this increased risk has not been observed  in ET. HT use in breast  cancer survivors 
may be associated  with an increased  risk of recurrence. EPT use  for longer than  5-10 years may be 
associated with an  increased risk of ovarian  cancer, although the incidence  rate is rare. There may 
also be increased  risk of lung cancer, or of  more  aggressive lung cancer, particularly in smokers.

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_929479]  ET initiated  early postmenopausally may reduce coronary artery disease  and CHD risk.[68] 
HT and neuroprotection.
Observational studies have suggested that HT, when taken within a “window  of opportunity” 
relative to menopause (operationally defined  as 5 years), may  be protective against cognitive  
decline including Alzheimer’s disease.[69] Beyond this, perhaps due to estrogen  receptor down-
regulation, HT may  even be  harmful,  leading  to increased  risk of stroke and dementia. This 
hypothesis appears to explain findings from the  Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study 
(WHIMS), a subset of the  Women’s Health Initiative, a landmark longitudinal study that included  
randomized controlled  trials evaluating the effects of (1) unopposed estrogen  and (2) EPT 
compared with placebo on a diverse set of  health outcomes. In WHIMS, HT  when initiated in 
women aged 65 or  above was  associated  with an increased risk of  dementia  of any cause and of 
cognitive decline [70].  Longitudinal placebo-controlled trials of the  effects of HT, initiated within 
the “window of opportunity,” on long-term risk of cognitive decline  are awaited. HT 
considerations in MS. Given  the initially  negative findings  from  the Women’s  Health  Initiative, 
very few women who are currently perimenopausal are  treated with HT,5 limiting the power of 
longitudinal observational studies. Of  particular importance in MS, are the long-term effects of HT 
on neuroprotection, altered  immune regulation, and osteoporosis,  which  are more common in 
women with MS than in healthy women in study  populations. Therefore, the benefit:risk ratio in 
these patients may be different from those in the general population. Additionally, because many women with MS are at increased risk of premature ovarian failure  due to their exposure to 
cyclophosphamide and  novantrone, the benefits to them of a  longer duration of HT  exposure  are 
unknown. Longitudinal  studies  are required to uncover  the effect that HT  may have, if any, on the  
aggregate balance of neuroinflammation and  neurodegeneration seen in MS,  as well  as in patients’ 
experiences and quality of life (QOL).  
As a response to the mixture of desirable and undesirable effects of estrogen  formulations on 
various tissues, through a  combination  of agonistic, neutral and antagonistic effects, selective 
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been developed,  with a wide range of effects.  
TSECs: Focus on CE/BZA. One important consideration  of treating  human  females  with 
SERMs, again, is the impact of  these  compounds  on various tissues.  Tamoxifen,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_685655],  induces  hot flashes, which  may severely limit its immediate 
tolerability in perimenopausal MS women, who in our experience  worsening  of symptoms, 
perhaps through the Uhthoff phenomenon.3 
More recently, tissue selective estrogen complexes (TSECs) have been developed to combine the benefits  of estrogen with SERMs’ tissue-specific properties.4  TSECs provide a progestin-
free alternative to traditional estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) in women with a uterus. Specifically, the effects on breast and endometrial proliferation, as well  as venous 
thromboembolism, observed with  estrogens were not noted when estrogen was  combined 
with bazefoxifene, and in  fact, BZA appears to mitigate the effects of  the estrogen .[ADDRESS_929480] to purely  estrogen compounds. 4

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_929481] of menopause in MS. In individuals with MS onset after age  50 there are fewer  sex 
differences (1) in disease type or (2) in time to an EDSS of 6 than there are in individuals with MS  
onset prior  to age  50. This suggests that changes around age 50 (menopause) may contribute to a 
narrowing of  sex differences  (Bove  et al., 2012).
In a cohort of  postmenopausal women, 124 had been prospectively followed through their  
menopause during CLIMB.  In these  women, we noted an  inflection point in  subjects’ disease  
severity at the time of menopause (Bove  et al, MS Journal 2015, in press). The rate of EDSS 
change increased  from 0.047 units per year before, to 0.15  units  per year after menopause  
(difference of 0.10 units; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17, p=0.005). A similar effect was observed in both the  
natural and surgical menopause  groups. When women  with only post-menopausal measurements 
(n=267) were also included in the model, the estimated increase in the  average yearly change was 
0.052 units  per year  (95% CI: 0.005, 0.098, p=0.029). These women were followed for  a mean 
duration of 10 years (SD 2.6, range  0.9-16.6),  and have both pre- and post-menopausal serial MRI 
and blood samples available.
These data were substantiated  by [CONTACT_685679] a  patient-powered  online research  platform,  
PatientsLikeMe, Inc (PLM).(Bove et al., 2013c) Using results from a  reproductive survey 
deployed to “active users”,  we compared prospectively collected disease severity  scores  (MS 
Rating Score (MSRS), good correlation with EDSS(Bove et al.,  2013c))  according to reproductive  
status. The  mean  (SD) MSRS at the  time  of the questionnaire was  higher in the surgical 
menopause group (13.1  (5.4)) than in the natural menopause (9.6 (5.1)) or cycling  (8.9 (5.5)) 
groups (age, disease duration and category-adjusted difference for  surgical vs. pre=3.27; 
p<0.0001; surgical  vs. natural=3.44; p<0.0001). A significant effect of menopausal age was 
observed when this  was included in the model (p<0.001). Interestingly, we found  associations of 
menopausal status with MS symptoms for the global MSRS score as well as  for individual MSRS

Diseases 2015). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_685657],  these  findings are  suggestive  
because of the biologically plausible associations with early, surgical  menopause.
Effect of sex and  gonadal steroids in MS neuroimaging. Our first set  of preliminary data come  
from a comparison of BPFs in 4 cohorts: men and  women, aged less than (38-46) and greater than  
(54-62) 50 years, and  followed for 2 years. In  that study, we found that both the older  and male 
cohorts had significantly greater rates of  BPF  atrophy than the  younger and  female cohorts (Table 
3). Men had lower BPF in a generalized linear  model adjusting  for age,  disease  type and  duration 
(p<0.0001). We assessed a  sex*age interaction to determine whether  there were sex –specific 
changes occurring after age 50, and this  was negative. A very important limitation is that 
menopausal status in these cohorts was not known at the time, and therefore  it is possible that a  
subset of  the women aged under 50 had already experienced early, surgical menopause.(R. Bove 
et al., 2013b) 
In a preliminary analysis  related to our neuroimaging measure, the corpus  callosum (CC), we 
measured crosssectional area  of the CC (as detailed in Aim 1b)  for [ADDRESS_929482] 
menopausal status was known (RB  training set). We found that CC area was significantly 
associated with timing of menopause  (est= -3  mm2 per year since menopause, p=0.0066) but not 
with age at MRI (p=0.57), when both were  included in a model.
Hormonal trials.
Trials of estrogen treatment in  healthy  perimenopausal women:
Recent approaches to treating  VMS  have compared low-dose oral  17β-estradiol (0.5 mg/d) (n=97), 
with SSRI/SNRIs (E.g.  low-dose venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release (75 mg/d) (n=96))  or 
placebo (n=146) for  8 weeks. Estradiol  reduced  the frequency of symptoms by 2.3 more per day 
than placebo (P<.001),  and venlafaxine reduced the frequency of symptoms  by 1.8 more  per day 
than placebo (P=.005).  Importantly,  within 8 weeks,  significant reduction in VMS  were noted with 
both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Joffe et  al., 2014).
HT in women  with MS. Using  data  from  the Nurses Health Study (NHS), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_685658]  a physical 
functioning assessment (PF10; subscale of  the Short  Form 36 (SF-36) QOL survey) at  a timepoint 
between 3 and 10 years after their final  menstrual period (early postmenopause) (Bove et  al, under 
review). We assessed the  association  between HT  use at this timepoint (never vs. at least  12 
months of systemic  estrogen with/without  progestin) and  both PF10  and the SF-36 Physical 
Component Scale (PCS). We  employed a linear  regression model adjusted  for age,  MS duration, 
and menopause type and  duration, and further  for other significant covariates (ancestry). HT users 
had average PF10  scores that were 23 points higher than non-HT users (adjusted p=0.004), and  
average PCS scores that were 9.15 points higher in the  subset of 59 women with these  available 
(adjusted p=0.021). Duration  of HT use  showed a similar trend for  PF10 (adjusted  p=0.057). 
While this study cannot establish causality,  it does  suggest that HT may  not result in excess 
adverse outcomes in women with MS.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
Three primary measurements to assess each of the three aims:
- The number of daily vasomotor symptoms (VMS), obtained  from the  patient  diary. In  healthy 
women, this was shown to significantly  decrease  with estradiol treatment at 8 weeks (Joffe  et al., 
2014). Power calculation: Given this  is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  we will view the  study as a success if the 
observed mean change  in the treatment group is larger by [CONTACT_685683] (“play the winner” approach). In  healthy women treated  with estradiol for 8 weeks ( Joffe et 
al., 2014),  VMS decreased  by 2.[ADDRESS_929486] 80% power to find the treatment arm mean  difference  to be larger with our proposed  sample size. This will explore 
the hypothesis that  CE+BZA  improves menopausal  symptoms in MS women.
- The MSRS, a global score capturing  patient impressions of MS severity across  eight function  
domains, and which in a  tertiary care  referral clinic population has shown good correlation with 
the EDSS. (Bove et  al., 2013, Wicks et al., 2012) This will explore  the hypothesis that CE+BZA  
results in improvement in MS-related  outcomes.
- The percentage  of subjects  reporting side  effects on the Satisfaction  Questionnaire for  
Medication (TSQM) (Atkinson  et al., 2004), which is commonly used in MS treatment studies 
(e.g. Calkwood et al., 2014). This will explore  the hypothesis that CE+BZA for [ADDRESS_929487] the hypothesis that CE+BZA improves menopausal symptoms in MS  women will be sleep quality from sleep  diary.  
- Our secondary endpoints to test the hypothesis that CE+BZA results in improvement in MS-related outcomes will include MSQOL54 composite  score (primary), measures of mood (CES-D), 
fatigue (MFIS), cognition  (MSNQ),  and bladder (MSQLI BLCS).
- Our secondary endpoints to test the hypothesis that CE+BZA for 8 weeks is tolerable  in women 
with MS will  be number of  missed doses, and the number  of new or enhancing lesions on 8-week 
MRI, to  verify that CE+BZA does  not yield any marked  changes in inflammatory activity.  
5.[ADDRESS_929488] 3 formal means of evaluating safety concerns during  the course of the study:
(1)All patients  receive an interim phone  call at week  6 to see if patient is  experiencing  any 
unacceptable side effects. We will compare rates in the  2 groups. 
(2)When approximately 50% of  patients  have completed the study through Study Visit  2 
(total visit  3), an interim analysis for safety will be conducted by [CONTACT_978], including clinical 
measures as well  as effects on liver function.  Serious adverse events will be  monitored by 
[CONTACT_685684].
(3)Also, we will  compare  MRI outcomes in the first 12 patients, in order to ensure that there 
is no increased MRI  signal.

9.1.6 Other Clinical Procedures
Neurological examination:
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS): EDSS Score will be determined, based on neurological 
examination, by a trained certified EDSS rater at scheduled visits  according to the  Schedule  Table, 
using the validated Neurostatus scoring system. Individual patients  will have EDSS performed by 
[CONTACT_685695]. The EDSS is an  ordinal scale used for  assessing neurological impairment  
of MS based  on a  neurological examination.  It consists of scores  in each of seven functional  
systems (FS)  and an  ambulation  score  that are  then  combined to determine the  EDSS  [ranging 
from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due  to MS)]. The FSs  are the Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal,  
Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel & Bladder, and Cerebral functions. The FSs and  EDSS  steps will be  
assessed in a standardized manner.  EDSS  is a widely used and  accepted instrument to evaluate 
disability status at a  given  time and  longitudinally, to assess disability progression in clinical 
studies in MS.
T25W: The  Timed 25-foot Walk will be assessed  according to the schedule in the Table. The 
Timed Walk is an objective quantitative  test of neurological function, and  is one of three 
components of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional  Composite  (MSFC),  a composite measure 
assessing upper extremity function, ambulation and cognitive function (Fisher  et al. 1999).  The 
Timed Walk is an ambulation measurement: a walk of 25 feet (7.62  meters):  time taken in 
seconds. The Timed Walk test  will be  administered either by [CONTACT_685696].
Patient-reported Outcomes:
MSQOL 54: The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-  54 (MSQOL-54) was the first MS-specific  
QOL measure.(1, 2) It includes a 36 generic instrument as  well as 18 additional  items, for a  total 
of 54 items.  (3) It is graded on 12 subscales  and 2 summary  scores:  the Physical Health  and 
Mental Health Composite  Summaries.
MFIS: The  Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)(4) is a 21-item fatigue scale that measures  the 
physical, cognitive, and  psychosocial aspects of fatigue.
HAD: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)(5) cutoff  is 8 for anxiety, depression.
MS Rating  Score-Revised: (MSRS, free  under  Creative  Commons License), patients rate their 
disability on a 0-4 scale in 8 areas (walking, use of  upper extremities, speech disturbance, vision, 
dysphagia, cognitive or  affective disturbance, sensory disturbance and  bowel/bladder). Composite 
scores range from  0-32.  The patient-reported MSRS has shown high internal consistency,

adequate known-groups validity (6). In a clinic population, the  previous version (MSRS) has 
demonstrated good correlations with physician-derived  EDSS (MSRS composite  score  rs=0.61, 
MSRS walking domain  rs =0.74)(7).
Bladder Control (MSQLI version): This questionnaire assesses bladder symptoms  and has been 
validated in MS (8).
MSNQ: MS  Neuropsychological Screening  questionnaire  (9).
Neuropsychological Tests:
Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT):
The SDMT is a  sensitive  and specific test  to assess processing speed and working memory  which 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_685665]. The  SDMT  has been  found to 
accurately categorize 72% of  MS subjects  as cognitively impaired based on a longer, 
comprehensive test battery.
During the administration  of the SDMT,  only the  examiner and the  patient  should be in the  testing 
room. The examiner can  be the study  coordinator, independent  EDSS  Rater or a qualified 
individual not involved  in the treatment of  the patients who  has been  instructed  in the appropriate 
administration of the  test.  Patients  are presented with a test  instrument  at the top of  which there is 
a row of nine numbers paired with unique symbols. Below this part  of the test instrument  is an 
array of  symbols paired with empty spaces,  the patient’s task is to verbally match the number for  
each symbol as quickly as possible.  The test takes  approximately [ADDRESS_929503]  answers in 90 seconds. (Partmenter et  al, Mult 
Scler 2007;13:52-57).
Letter Number Sequencing Subtest: LNS,  from the Wechsler Memory Scale  (verbal  working

there be  any significant hormonal changes observed during the study, then  we will pursue 
immunology testing to probe
correlations between hormonal and  immunological changes.
9.3.2. MRI
There will be an  MRI exam at Visit  [ADDRESS_929505] as is done  for many routine clinical exams. If  
necessary, an I.V.  (intravenous) line may be set up during  or prior to the  exam to allow  the 
injection of this compound during the MRI acquisition.  I.V. access is the placing  of a small Teflon 
catheter or  small needle  into one of  the veins, preferably in the arm.  A small amount of fluid, 
usually normal saline (salt  water) or  dextrose (sugar)  5% in water  is dripped  in to prevent  the 
catheter from clogging.
The MRI scan performed  for the study will be  reviewed  by a neuroradiologist. The Primary  
Treating Physician must  be contact[CONTACT_685697] (not consistent with MS) 
detected on the MRI scan for  safety actions and Adverse Event reporting.  During the  study  the 
scan will  be assessed  by [CONTACT_685698]. Upon 
acquisition MRI will be evaluated for quality, completeness, and adherence to the manual. Confirmation of MRI quality or a description of  the quality problems,  if detected, will be 
communicated to the investigators. If  scan is incomplete  or incorrectly performed,  the study center 
will be asked to repeat it as soon as possible. After completion  of the quality check, all scans  will 
be analyzed according to a  standardized procedure.

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE  REPORTING  AND DOCUMENTATION
11.1 Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a  clinical  investigation  of a patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship  
with the treatment. An AE is therefore  any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including an  
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the  administration  
of an investigational product, whether or  not related to that investigational product. An unexpected  
AE is one of a type  not identified in nature,  severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure or  of greater severity or frequency  than  expected based on the information  in the  
Investigator’s Brochure.
The Investigator will probe,  via discussion with the  subject,  for the occurrence of AEs during each 
subject visit  and record the  information  in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be  
recorded in the  patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and  stop dates 
and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation  to study drug,  or if unrelated, the cause.
AE Severity
The National  Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) 
Version 3.0 should be used to assess  and grade  AE severity,  including laboratory abnormalities  
judged to be clinically significant. The modified  criteria  can be found in the study manual.  If the 
experience is  not covered in the modified criteria, the  guidelines shown in Table 1 below should 
be used to  grade severity.  It should be  pointed  out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity 
and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.
Riley Bove,  MD
Protocol 15-[ZIP_CODE] Confidential
Version #: 1 Version Date: 12/16/2015 Page 29 of 41
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 Table 1 .  AE  Severity  Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or  mild discomfort; no limitation  in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject  may be aware of the  sign  
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to  moderate limitation in activity, no or  minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].
Life-threatening (4) The subject  is at risk of  death due to the adverse  experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
AE Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship  of an AE  to the study drug should be  assessed  using  the following the guidelines  
in Table 2.
Table 2 .  AE  Relationship to Study Drug
Relationship
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity  of agent; or an event that follows a  reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug;  that follows a known or expected  response 
pattern to the suspected  drug; that is confirmed  by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_405039];  and that  is not explained by [CONTACT_405056].
Probably An event that  follows  a reasonable  temporal sequence from  administration  of the  
drug; that follows  a known or expected response pattern  to the  suspected drug;  that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_405040]; and  that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_405057]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_405058].
Possibly An event that  follows  a reasonable  temporal sequence from  administration  of the  
drug; that follows  a known or expected response pattern  to that  suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number  of other factors.
Unrelated An event that  can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the  study 
drug.
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences  (SAE)
An SAE is  defined  as any AE occurring at any  dose  that results in any  of the following outcomes:
death
a life-threatening adverse experience
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685666]
a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Riley Bove,  MD
Protocol 15-[ZIP_CODE] Confidential
Version #: 1 Version Date: 12/16/2015 Page 30 of 41
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Other important medical  events may also  be considered an SAE when,  based  on appropriate 
medical judgment, they jeopardize  the subject or require intervention to prevent one of  the 
outcomes listed.  
11.2.1 Serious  Adverse Experience Reporting
Study sites will  document all  SAEs that occur  (whether  or not related to study drug) per UCSF 
CHR Guidelines.  The collection period for  all SAEs will begin after informed consent  is obtained  
and end after procedures for the final study  visit have been completed.
All adverse reporting guidelines will be  followed carefully. There are  no procedures in this 
protocol that are considered to be high risk or pose  physical harm  to subjects. Nevertheless, 
unforeseen adverse events may occur.  Any adverse event will be reported in writing to the  IRB  
within 24 hours of the event. We will then provide a  full written report  to the Partners  Human 
Studies Committees within 10 working days/[ADDRESS_929507]-related issues or data problems. The  Study Coordinator takes  notes  from the  weekly  meetings  and records them 
into minutes which  are kept on file. All information gathered  in this study is reviewed and cross-
checked for accuracy and completeness by [CONTACT_978].  Study  staff will also ensure the adherence to the 
IRB-approved protocol and integrity of the data by [CONTACT_685699],  including the completeness of consent forms, on a weekly basis. If any  information is 
missing or  errors are found, study staff will notify the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_685667] a plan of corrective action. 
All Human Subjects Committees  will be  notified in writing if missing data or errors are 
determined to be a  protocol deviation/violation  within [ADDRESS_929508] (IRB)/Independent  Ethics Committee  (IEC),  the site investigator  will report SAEs to the 
IRB/IEC.

Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result  in a protocol 
violation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50366]  a protocol  violation  will result  in withdrawal  of a subject.
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed  with the investigator  and a Protocol  
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated.  This form will be signed  by a Sponsor 
representative and the Investigator. A copy of the form will  be filed in the  site’s regulatory binder 
and in the Sponsor’s files.
14 DATA  SAFETY MONITORING  
Safety Data  Monitoring  throughout the trial: Since  this trial is a  single-site trial and  the overseeing 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_685669],  a Data and Safety Monitoring  Board  is not deemed 
necessary. 
The study investigator  will be responsible for monitoring safety  data and adverse events recorded  
in the patient  file and  will be responsible for reporting such  events  to the CHR. 
In addition to the  PI, a staff neurologist ([CONTACT_685719], a senior  clinician  with expertise in MS 
clinical trials) and a  staff obstetrician/gynecologist  ([CONTACT_685720]) will review together  the 
interim safety analyses to be conducted  after (1) [ADDRESS_929513] completed the entire trial, 
including MRI (2)  each  patient has completed the week 6 phone call, and (3)  any AEs are 
reported. 
oSTOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_641417]:
MRI: 2-fold  increase in  new T2 or gado enhancing lesions  in 
treatment compared to placebo group
oPATIENT  WITHDRAWAL RULE:
Abnormal uterine  bleeding
Thromboembolic event (DVT,  PE, other)
Further details regarding the timing and  content of  the interim  reviews  is included in the 
statistical section below.
Safety assessments will be throughout patient visits  to ensure patient welfare and safety  in daily 
activities. Such assessments will include:
Physical Examination
Vital  Signs
Height and Weight measurements
Pregnancy and Assessments of Fertility
Fatigue Assessment
Health Status Questionnaire
Blood  tests  to assess potential  abnormal increase  of liver enzymes and serum triglycerides
Lab tests to  assess hormone levels.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 The Investigator will meet with the study staff biweekly to review safety  as well  as efficacy data  
collected from patient visits and assess the safety of the visits and study outcomes.
Patient withdrawal from  the study / Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: Study treatment must be discontinued  for any 
patient if the investigator  determines that continuing  would result in a  significant  risk for  that 
patient. The  following conditions/events may be considered sufficient to support a decision  about 
the study drug  discontinuation in individual cases:
Adverse event/serious adverse event
Abnormal laboratory  value(s) or abnormal test result(s)
Withdrawal of informed consent
Pregnancy
Use of prohibited other investigational medications
Deviations  from  the prescribed dose  regimen for the study drug
Any other  protocol  deviation that  results in a significant risk to  the patient’s  safety
Discontinuation of the study drug must be  recorded  along with the patient information in 
REDCap, giving the date and primary and secondary reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262]. The investigator must also contact [CONTACT_685701] (University  of 
[LOCATION_004] at San Francisco  Multiple  Sclerosis Center)  to register the  patient’s discontinuation  
from randomized study drug. Patients may voluntarily  withdraw  from the  study  for any reason at 
any time. They  may  be considered withdrawn if  they  state an intention  to withdraw,  fail to return  
for visits, or become lost  to follow-up for  any other reason. For patients who are lost to follow-up 
(i.e. those patients whose  status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without 
stating an intention to withdraw),  the investigator should show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_540345], e.g. dates  of telephone calls, registered 
letters, etc.  If premature  withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must  make every effort  
to determine the primary reason for a patient’s premature withdrawal from the  study  and record 
this information with  the patient’s  research  data  in REDCap  as well as report this withdrawal  to 
the Committee on Human  Research  if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_239097].
Patients will be  considered  to have completed  the study if they attend all protocol  specified  visits 
and complete all assessments. A patient who discontinues  the study medication  for any reason, 
including an adverse event must complete  a Safety Follow-Up visit. Any patient still  in screening 
at the time  [ADDRESS_929514] refer  them for  appropriate  ongoing care.  The study can  be terminated  at 
any time for any reason by [CONTACT_093]. Should this be necessary, each patient  should be seen 
as soon as  possible  and treated as  described  for a prematurely withdrawn patient.  The investigator 
may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure  that adequate  
consideration is given to the protection of  the patient’s interests. The investigator  will be 
responsible for informing  the Committee on Human Research of the  trial’s early termination.
15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to the analysis of the  final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
written describing  all analyses that will be performed. The  SAP  will contain  any modifications  to 
the analysis plan  described below.

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_929515] one  dose of the study 
drug (the Safety Population) will be  included  in the  safety analysis.
15.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The following demographic  variables at screening will be  summarized by [CONTACT_15500]: 
race, age,  height and  weight.  
15.[ADDRESS_929516] age,  disease  duration, and  
DMT (disease modifying therapy).
Primary endpoints:
Aim 1. To explore the  hypothesis  that CE+BZA improves menopausal  symptoms in MS women.
Outcomes: Our primary measure will be the  number of daily vasomotor  symptoms  (VMS), 
obtained from the  patient diary. In  healthy women, this  was shown to significantly decrease  with 
estradiol treatment at  8 weeks).(Joffe et al., 2014) 
Power calculation: Given  this is a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will view the  study  as a success  if the observed 
mean change in the  treatment group  is larger by [CONTACT_685702] (“play  
the winner” approach).  In healthy women treated with estradiol for 8 weeks,(Joffe  et al., 2014) 
VMS decreased by 2.[ADDRESS_929517] 80% power  to find  the 
treatment arm mean difference to be  larger with our  proposed sample  size.
Aim 2. To explore the  hypothesis  that CE+BZA results  in improvement in MS-related outcomes.
Our primary outcome will be MSQOL54 composite score  (primary).
Aim 3. To explore the  hypothesis  that CE+BZA for 8 weeks is tolerable in women with MS.
Our primary measure will be the percentage of subjects reporting side effects on the  Satisfaction
Questionnaire for  Medication (TSQM)(Atkinson et al., 2004), which is commonly used in MS 
treatment studies (e.g.(Calkwood  et al., 2014)).  
15.4 Analysis of  Secondary Endpoints
These methods will  be the same as per primary endpoints.
Secondary endpoints are:
Aim 1. To explore the  hypothesis  that CE+BZA improves menopausal  symptoms in MS women.
Our secondary measure will be sleep  quality  from  sleep diary. 
Aim 2. To explore the  hypothesis  that CE+BZA results  in improvement in MS-related outcomes.
Our secondary outcomes will be: measures  of mood (CES-D), fatigue (MFIS),  cognition  (MSNQ), 
and bladder (MSQLI BLCS), and our  primary outcome is  the MSRS, a global score capturing 
patient impressions of MS severity across eight function domains.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 Aim 3. To explore the  hypothesis  that CE+BZA for 8 weeks is tolerable in women with MS.
Our secondary measures will be  number of missed doses, and the number  of new or  enhancing  
lesions on 8-week MRI, to verify that CE+BZA  does not yield any  marked  changes in 
inflammatory activity.
Safety and tolerability data will be  summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Adverse event rates will be  coded  by [CONTACT_374640]. Adverse events 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_685703], the rate of occurrence,  and the severity and relationship to study  drug.   
15.5 Interim Analysis
After each patient completes the Week  6 phone call, the side effects reported will be analyzed.
When 50% of  patients have completed the study through Study Visit 2 (total visit 3), an interim  
analysis for safety will be  conducted by [CONTACT_978], with the  collaboration of Drs. Green (neurology) 
and [CONTACT_685721] (Ob/Gyn).
Serious adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_685704].
15.6 Sample Size and Randomization
The sample  size for this protocol was determined by [CONTACT_716]. Given  this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  we 
will view the study as a  success  if the observed mean change in the  treatment group is larger by 
[CONTACT_685705] (“play  the winner” approach). In healthy women 
treated with estradiol  for 8 weeks,( Joffe  et al., 2014) VMS decreased by 2.[ADDRESS_929518] 80% power  to find the treatment arm mean difference  to be  
larger with our proposed sample size.
Subjects will be 1:[ADDRESS_929519]’s

corresponding to that  visit  is available.  Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_685706]  (or designee), but will be 
identified by a site number,  subject number and  initials.
If a correction is required  for an eCRF, the time and date stamps  track  the person entering or 
updating eCRF data and  creates an electronic  audit  trail.

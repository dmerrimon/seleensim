Background, Rationale and Context  
The standard practice for arthroscopic shoulder surgery at our institution is a general anesthetic 
with a long -acting interscalene block for post-operative pain control , which  can reduce the 
amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_665718] .[ADDRESS_899147] pain in the axilla even in the setting of a functioning interscalene 
brachial plexus nerve block. One of our surgeons has  reported a high incidence o f axillary pain  in 
patients who undergo  a sub -pectoral biceps tenodesis as part of their arthroscopic procedure.  A 
newly described nerve block approach to the nerves that supply sensation to the axillary  region 
called the PECS 1 & 2 block  may provide additional analgesia to these patients .3,4 
 
Objectives  
The purpose of this prospective, randomized, observer and patient blinded , single -center, sham 
block  trial is to determine if the addition of PECS blocks to an interscalene block will redu ce the 
severity of axillary pain following arthroscopic  shoulder surgery that involves a  sub-pectoral 
biceps tenodesis.  Secondarily, the study will assess  the duration of PECS 1 & [ADDRESS_899148]-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444]. We hypothesize that the addition of the PECS 1 & [ADDRESS_899149] practice at our institution of an interscalene 
brachial plexus block  along with a general anesthetic .  The intervention arm will get an  additi onal 
local anesthetic block  targeting nerves that we presume  cover the axillary region  (PECS 1 & 2) .   
These nerves in the upper chest  are the lateral braches of the T2 to T5 intercostal nerves, which 
includes the intercostobrachial nerve.  The anesthesiologist placi ng the nerve blocks will be un -
blinded to perform the procedures. Both the surgeon and the Acute Pain Service anesthesiologist 
will be blinded as to whether or not the intervention was provided to any given subject.  The 
Acute Pain Service team will remain  blinde d and collect the data outcomes.      
 
Setting  
Subjects undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery with a sub -pectoral biceps tenodesis , by a 
single surgeon at our institution , will be assessed either in person or by [CONTACT_665733].  Post-operative a mbulatory surgery subjects will be asked [ADDRESS_899150]  and the Numerical Rating Scale pain 
score  (0-10) will be recorded as the primary outcome. Secondary endpoints will include, but are 
not limited to; total narcotic usage, presence of nausea or vomiting through the first 24hrs, as well 
as time to return of axillary pain .  These outcomes will  be assessed by [CONTACT_665734]-op day

Protocol version:  
Template updated 9.24.[ADDRESS_899151] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665719] -pectoral 
biceps tenodesis will be eli gible for this study . 
 
 Inclusion Criteria  
Adults, between [ADDRESS_899152] agreed to a regional with general anesthesia 
technique will be recruited to participate.  
 Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects with contraindications to regional anesthesia, such as history of allergy to amide 
local a nesthetics, presence of a progressive neurological deficit, a pre -existing coagulopathy, 
infection, significant pulmonary disease contraindicating phrenic nerve blockade(a known 
side effect of an interscalene block) or the following conditions: chronic use  of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_665720] (>3 months of a combined total of more than 40mg oxycodone equivalents a day ), 
body habitus that make s successful pl acement of PECS blocks unlikely or pregnancy . 
              Sample Size   
Initially, pi[INVESTIGATOR_665721] a total of ten patients with five patients randomized to  
each arm.  Primary endpoint was Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  of 0-[ADDRESS_899153] (an alpha of 0.05 and power of 
0.95), we conservatively estimate that [ADDRESS_899154] a clinically 
meaningful difference of 2 in NRS  betwee n the arms. We decided to plan enrollment of 20 
subjects per arm for potential loss during this randomized, double -blinded, single -center, 
sham block  trial.  
 
Interventions and Interactions  
 All patients scheduled by [INVESTIGATOR_124].Freehill for arthroscopy with biceps tenodesis surgery will be 
given the PECS  Study Consent Form during the orthopedic clinic visit for review.  The study 
team will then examine  the electronic medical record of these potential subjects for  exclusion 
criteria. If the subject is exc luded, then they will be added to the Screening Log with date  and 
reason for their exclusion.  If all inclusion criteria are met, then the subject will be 
approached in the Regional Anesthesia area on the day of surgery for further discussion of the 
study protocol . Upon completion of consent, one signed copy will remain with the subject 
while a second signed document will be maintained by [CONTACT_665735].   
 Patients will be asked to provide baseline verbal pain scores bot h, at rest and w ith movement , 
on a scale of 0 -10 ([ADDRESS_899155] pain). Preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_665722](s), dosage and frequency will be recorded. Randomization of patients will 
then occur through the use of sequentially numbered envelopes w ith only those directly 
involved in the care of the patient during block placement being aware of which arm of the 
study the patient has been randomized. Those members of the study team who will be  
collecting post -operative data will be blinded to the rand omization.  
 Standard AS A monitors and oxygen will be applied.  Unless there is a contraindication , each 
patient will receive [ADDRESS_899156] on postoperative 
pain, ketamine will not be given as a preoperative sedation medication or intraoperative 
medication.  No long acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_665723]. 
Protocol version:  
Template updated 9.24.14  4 Intraoperative fent anyl will be limited to 5 micrograms per kg.  Intraoperative dexamethasone 
will not be given for PONV prophylaxis.   
 Subjects will be sedated as per usual practice and will also be blinded to their randomization.  
All peripheral nerve blocks will be perfor med by a resident or fellow under supervision by [CONTACT_665736].  T he attending anesthesiologist may perform the procedures alone.  
All volumes and concentrations of nerve block mixtures administered will be i dentical to 
assist in the blindi ng process.  
 All 40 subjects will receive an ultrasound guided interscalene nerve block using 20mL of 
0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 1:400k epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027] 1:600k clonidine dosed at the upper trunk 
location near the C6 vertebral level , per standard clinical practi ce.  The intervention arm, 
consisting of 20 patients, will additi onally receive the following: 10mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_665724] 1:400k epi [INVESTIGATOR_665725] 1:600K clonidine  at the PECS1 location and 20mL of 0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 1:400k epi [INVESTIGATOR_665725] 1:600k clonidine at the PECS2 location as 
described by [CONTACT_665737], et al.3,4  
 All procedures will be performed under a sterile technique inc luding the use of chlorhexidine 
prep of the skin, sterile gloves, sterile ultrasound probe cover s with sterile ultra sound gel, a 
cap and a mask. For the interscalene block, a 21 gauge  90mm  stimulating block needle  will 
be directed , under real -time ultrasound guidance , into the interscalene muscle space at the 
level of the C5  and C6 nerve roots. Twenty mL  of the above lo cal anesthetic mixture will be 
dosed incrementally, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_665726] 5 mL , to surround the upper trunk of the brachial 
plexus. For the PECS 1 & [ADDRESS_899157] between the 
pectoralis minor and pector alis major  muscles.  Ten mL of the same local anesthetic mixture 
will be d osed incrementally, every 5 mL , to spread within this PEC1 space . 
 Fifteen and 30 minutes (if no change at 15min) f ollowing block placement, success will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_21514]/decrease of pin -prick sensation to a 25gauge Whitacre needle in the 
following manner:  
o Cutaneous sensation will be tested over the deltoid region to assess for successful  
interscalene block.  
o Cutaneous sensation will be tested over the lateral aspect of the pectoralis 
muscles at the level of the nipple.  
o Scoring of sensation will be the following: 0= full sensation, 1= partial sensation, 
2= no sensation (complete block)  
 Following block placements, the subjects will be transported to the OR and general 
anesthesia will be induced.  Following intubation, surgical procedure, emergence an d 
extubation, the subject will be transported to the recovery room. In the recovery room  or via 
phone post -discharge , at the 6hr mark post -block placement,  we will ask the subject if they 
are having any axillary pain.  The severity  of pain  will be determined  using the Numerical 
Rating Scale of 0-10. Zero is no pain and [ADDRESS_899158] pain possible. Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_665727] -Op, Intra -Op and PACU  time fram es.  
 Expected time commitment for t he subjects is the following: (4 0 minutes total)  
o Enrollment - 15 minute discussion and signing of documents  
o Block placement and assessment - 15 minutes more than non -participants 
(additional 2 injections)  
o Recovery room data  collection - 5 minutes  
o Postop day  1 phone call data collection - 5 minutes

Outcome Measure(s)  
Primary: Post -operative ambulatory surgery subjects will be asked [ADDRESS_899159].  Visual analog pain scores (0 -10) will be recorded with 
0= no pain, 10=most pain possible.  
Secondary: These endpoints will include, but are not limited to; total narcotic usage , VAS pain 
scores at rest at 24hrs, the presence of nausea or v omiting through the first 24hrs  and the  time to 
return of axillary pain.  These outcomes we be assessed by [CONTACT_665738] -op 
day 1.  
 
Analytical Plan  
Results will be analyzed initially using descriptive statistics  for baseline characteristics .  The primary 
outcome VAS will be analyzed using a two sample t test. In the situation where the primary outcome 
VAS is highly skewed, we will use a non -parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to determine the 
intervention effect. F or secondary outcomes, c omparison between groups will be done using chi square 
tests for proportions, and two sample t-tests for continuous variables.    
 
Human Subjects Protection  
 
Subject Recruitment Methods  
The subject will be identified by [CONTACT_665739]’ s notes for  
shoulder arthroscopy procedures with a sub -pectoral biceps tenodesis component.  Assuming the subjects 
meet inclusion criteria , they will be assigned to the Regional Anesthesia area and any of the follow ing 
will enroll the subjects: Wells Reynolds, MD,  Sean Dobson, MD, Chris Edwards, MD, Daryl Henshaw, 
MD, Doug Jaffe, DO, or Robert Weller, MD. The subjects will  be contact[CONTACT_665740].  Both genders will be included  equally and onl y exclusion criteria noted 
earlier  will be used. The recruitment of potential subjects will only be evident by a marking on the 
operating room schedule, within the secure electronic medical record, that denotes  their assignment to the 
Regional Anesthesia Pre -operative area. This marking does not identify the subjects as research study 
candidates.

Ver 7/20/[ADDRESS_1234503] of the world’s 
population reports insufficient sleep duration and as much 70% report poor quality or non- restorative 
sleep1 which can have cascading impacts on an individual’s health and wellbeing, inc luding increased risk 
for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, depression, and accidents.2-[ADDRESS_1234504] due to absenteeism and presenteeism, resulting in the loss of 
an average of 44–54 working days per year.5 A recent RAND report estimated the economic losses 
associated with insomnia in several of the world’s largest economies, includ ing an estimated $207.5 
billion dollar loss annually.6 
Given the profound consequences to public health and the economy, it is important to identify 
novel and scalable treatment options to aid the millions of individuals worldwide experiencing poor sleep 
quality. Importantly, the front -line treatment for insomnia is cognitive- behavioral therapy for insomnia.7 
However, this treatment remains underutilized due to a combination of factors, including a lack of 
specialty trained providers and lack of time and resources by [CONTACT_585253].8 Furthermore, 
the typi[INVESTIGATOR_882606] 6 to 8 sessions, which may be a time burden for many patients, especially for in -person treatment. Moreover, from a prevention perspecti ve, there is an 
acute need to identify safe, effective, and non -invasive treatments to improve sleep quality, in those 
experiencing poor sleep quality though not necessarily meeting diagnostic criteria for clinical insomnia. 
This perspective is also consis tent with current recommendations to consider sleep health on a continuum, 
as opposed to discrete clinical disorders only, and to promote sleep health across the continuum.
9  
Recognizing this need, the current study investigates a novel device (Evolv28) de signed to 
improve sleep through the application of variable weak magnetic frequencies. Evolv28 is a wearable sleep 
wellness device that contains coils that emits variable complex weak magnetic fields (VCMFs) through a 
neckband. The device is classified as a low -risk wellness device that does not require FDA approval.  
[ADDRESS_1234505] with neural activity by [CONTACT_882610]'s electromagnetic environment. Results of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_882607]28 suggest that 
device users may experience reductions in perceived stress and anxiety. Given strong associations 
between stress, anxiety, and poor sleep quality,[ADDRESS_1234506] patterns associated with different sleep stages, suggesting their potential to enhance 
the restorative aspects of sleep.11-13 By [CONTACT_882611], it may be possible to fac ilitate 
transitions between sleep stages, potentially helpi[INVESTIGATOR_882608] (i.e., improve sleep efficiency) 
and improve sleep quality.  
The goal of the current study was to conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_882609]28 dev ice for improving sleep quality among individua ls reporting poor sleep quality. If 
successful, this intervention could represent a novel and  scalable solution to the  widespread global 
problem of poor sleep quality and its downstream consequences.  
 
 
METHOD 
Study Design  
The study was a randomized, double blinded, placebo- controlled trial with 4- week intervention followed 
by a two- month open label follow -up period. This study was approved by [CONTACT_746545] (IRB_00165943) and registered on clinicaltrials.gov 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 Participants  
Participants were recruited from the [LOCATION_002]  via social media advertising and the University 
of Utah research study locator portal. Inclusion criteria  included the following: age 18- 65, read and write 
in English, smartphone user and reporting moderate to severe insomnia symptoms, defined as an 
4 
 
 
 Insomn ia Severity Index score of >15. Participants were excluded if they had diagnosed sleep disorders 
other than insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome) or were currently receiving additional 
treatment for insomnia (e.g., hypnotic medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, etc.). Further exclusion 
criteria include a history of serious mental health conditions (e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire 8 score of >15, psychosis, Bipolar I or the use of antipsychotic or mood stabilizing drugs), serious physical conditions (e.g., current cancer treatment, neurological illness) , drug use (as defined by >14 alcoholic 
beverages per week, the use of cannabis >[ADDRESS_1234507] month, any use of illicit stree t drugs), 
caffeine intake of >400mg per day, overnight work more than once a month, frequent moderate to severe migraine attacks or headaches, pregnancy, and traveling across time zones >3 times throughout the study 
period. 
Procedure  
All study procedures w ere performed remotely. Interested participants completed a screening 
survey, then i f eligible, a study coordinator contact[CONTACT_882612] a time to complete informed consent. Upon completion of informe d consent, 
study materials were sent to the participant that consisted of the Evolv28 device (inactive) , a Fitbit and 
device instructions. Upon receipt of the study material s, participants completed an instructional meeting 
with study staff, where they reviewed  baseline procedures and Fitbit setup . Participants then completed 
online surveys, 7 days of daily electronic sleep diary  surveys (SurveySignal) and wore the Fitbit for 7 
days. 
After participants completed their baseline week, a staff member , who was not associated with 
the study, determined each participant’s group assignment and then sent that participant’s device serial 
number to programmers. P articipants were randomized 1:1 between intervention and control groups. The 
randomization  table  was generated using a random number table stratified by [CONTACT_882613] 4 to 6 participants. Study staff and participants were both blinded to treatment group 
assignment. To begin the 4- week  trial period , the study coordi nator met with each participant to ensure 
the device was activated  and confirmed the participant’s understanding of how to use it. The intervention 
[ADDRESS_1234508] -trial assessment, all Evolv28  were 
transitioned to run the active treatment program between week 4 and 3 months . At the end of 3 months , 
participants completed online  questionnaires. Participants were compensated with $[ADDRESS_1234509] and kept the study Fitbit and Evolv28 device.  
 
Measures  
Demographics: P articipants filled out a brief demographic measure that contained questions on age, sex, 
gender, rac e/ethnicity, marital status, education level, household income level, and employment status.  
 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): The ISI is a widely used tool that assesses the severity of insomnia.[ADDRESS_1234510] of these on daily functioning. Each question is scored 0- 4 and 
summed, allowing for a total range of 0 t o 28. Higher scores indicate a greater severity of insomnia, with 
15-21 interpreted as moderate insomnia and 22- 28 interpreted as severe insomnia.  
 Sleep Disturbance and Sleep -Related Impairment: Participants completed PROMIS sleep disturbance and 
sleep -related impairment,
[ADDRESS_1234511] of sleep, with scores greater than 60 considered elevated.  
 
Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire 10- item (FOSQ -10): The FOSQ -[ADDRESS_1234512] greater impairment due to sleep -
related issues.  
 
General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD- 7): The GAD-[ADDRESS_1234513] were reverse scored, then summed for a total score. Higher scores indicate more severe general anxiety.  
 Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): The PSS
[ADDRESS_1234514] were reverse scored. Higher scores indicate a greater amount of perceived stress.  
 
Patient Health Questionnaire 8: The Patient Health Questionnaire [ADDRESS_1234515] in doing things, or trouble concentrating. Each question is scored and added together on a 4- point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate a greater severity 
of depressive symptoms. Scores > 10 indicate the presence of depressive symptoms.  
 Sleep Diary: Participants completed items from the Co nsensus Sleep diary.
[ADDRESS_1234516] occurred. Using these diaries, 
we calculated sleep latency, sleep duration, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency. Sleep diary data 
was cleaned (e.g., reviewed for AM/PM errors, negative sleep efficiencies and sleep efficiencies >1) 
diaries were considered valid if participants had  at least 4 valid days completed.  
 
Objective sleep/wake estimation: Sleep -wake data was estimated using a Charge [ADDRESS_1234517] week of the trial. Fitbits are comparable to research- grade actigraphy for estimating sleep duration.
21 Fitbit data was collected and aggregated 
using the Fitabase platform. Fitbit- derived sleep variables included total sleep time, wake after sleep onset 
(WASO) and sleep efficiency (percent asleep divided b y the sleep period time). Sleep periods were auto -
scored, and therefore the sleep latency variable was not valid. The sleep variables were scored by [CONTACT_882614], using the stages algorithm (with heart rate data) when possible, and if not available  using 
the classic (movement only) algorithm. Most  days both pre and post for each group were scored using the 
stages algorithm (>90%) and therefore all valid days were used in the analysis. To determine a valid day, 
we first identified the primary sleep p eriod. Primary sleep periods <[ADDRESS_1234518] 4 nights of valid data.  
 Evolv28 a dherence:  Evolv28 adherence was collected via the company’s dashboard. The dashboard was 
password protected and only study staff not associated with screening and assessments had access to this data. The dashboard contained participant ID, group assignment (intervention or control) and device usage  (average and total).  
 Adverse events: At 4-weeks and 3- months , participants completed a measure that asked if they 
experienced any symptoms while wearing the sleep device, when they developed, and their degree of 
[ADDRESS_1234519] for time  and time x group 
interaction. The primary outcome wa s defined as change in ISI at 1 -month. We also conducted linear 
mixed models to examine change over time and time x group changes from baseline to 3-months. 
Analyses were conducted as intention to treat and all participants who completed baseline data and were 
randomized were included in the mixed models. We utilized chi -square tests to evaluate percentage with a 
response to the intervention (decrease of 6 points or more on the ISI) and remission (ISI post-intervention 
score < 7). An a -priori power analysis, assuming a medium- to-large effect size of d = 0.74, indicated that a 
total sample size of 60 participants (30 per group) would provide a power of 80% to detect significant 
differences with a two -sided alpha level of 0.05.

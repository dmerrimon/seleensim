2 Synopsis  
Purpose 
Feedback and Outcomes for Clinically Useful Student Services (FOCUSS) is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_715219]- effectiveness study to increase the use of measurement -based care 
(MBC) among  school -based mental health clinicians who provide psychosocial treatment 
interventions to K-12 students with various mental health needs. T he purpose of the study 
is to examine the implementation outcomes (i.e., feasibility, appropriateness, 
acceptability, and fidelity) of MBC in school -based mental health treatment services. We 
also plan to observe the effectiveness of MBC on student engagement  and treatment 
outcomes as a secondary goal. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_65673]- effectiveness  trial is designed to 
inform a future, large -scale trial with more participants.  
Potential Impact  
Millions of children and adolescents are diagnosed with a mental health disorder each 
year. Of these, only half receive any mental health treatment. More mental health 
treatment services are delivered in schools than any other child- serving sector. Schools 
offer an unparalleled opportunity to improve children’s access to mental health treatment,  
but the quality  of care provided in the school setting is highly variable and generally not 
evidence- based. School -based mental health clinicians lead the provision of mental 
health services for children; they must provide effective treatment.  
A vital opportunity to improve school mental health (SMH) quality is the successful implementation of measurement -based care (MBC). MBC is the  
routine collection and use 
of student - or parent -reported symptom and functioning data to monitor progress 
collaboratively with the family and inform treatment decisions . MBC can be applied to a 
wide variety of mental health disorders and treatment plans.  MBC is associated with 
greater and faster reduction of symptoms, improvements in functioning, patient 
engagement,  and shared decision- making , but clinicians do not use it regularly and little is 
know n about its implementation and effectiveness  in SMH.  
Planned analyses  
Data analysis will assess the implementation outcomes (i.e., acceptability,  
appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity) of MBC resulting from implementation strategies used to increase MBC among SMH clinicians. I hypothesize that clinicians’ MBC 
implementation outcome ratings will increase following the implementation strategies 
provided as compared to their ratings during the baseline period. Secondary analyses will 
explore the effect of MBC on engagement  and mental health outcomes to support  a future 
R01 application.  Linear mixed effects modeling will be used to account for correlation over 
time and clustering within clinician.  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a multi -method implementation 
support package  will help school -based mental health clinicians use MBC strategies , as 
measured by [CONTACT_715233] (e.g., feasibility, acceptability, 
appropriateness, and use or fidelity) with K -[ADDRESS_974237] leadership to promote 
implementation (e.g., by [CONTACT_715234]).  I 
hypothesize that clinicians’ ratings of MBC implementation outcomes will increase

3 following the implementation strategies provided as compared to their ratings during the 
baseline period without strategies.  
Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether MBC implementation in 
schools is associated with engagement in treatment and student outcomes (i.e., reduction 
in symptoms and improvements in functioning) over the course of SMH treatment.   
Study Design  
A clustered, multiple- baseline design will be used to examine the impact of 
implementation support on clinicians’ fidelity, use and ratings of MBC appropriateness, acceptability and fidelity. Approximately [ADDRESS_974238] -wide quality 
improvement initiative.  All clinicians will receive the same implementation supports; there 
is no random assignment to condition. Following an initial control period of at least 1 month, school districts will start receiving implementation supports. B aseline MBC use, 
attitudes, acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness  (per clinician self -report) will be 
collected, as well as needs assessment data from clinician surveys to inform necessary adjustments to the implementation supports.  Baseline engagement and student outcomes 
will be collected after initial clinician training session.  MBC implementation outcomes (i.e., 
MBC use, attitudes, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility), engagement and 
student outcomes will be collected at 3- month and [ADDRESS_974239] 
ratings  of implemen tation outcomes  for all N= [ADDRESS_974240] -training group 
consultation calls will be conducted for 6-months , and online, self -report surveys will be 
collected at baseline, 3 -month, 6 -month and 9 -month intervals. Clinicians will be asked to 
implement measurement -based care, using the Better Outcomes Now (BON) online 
feedback system, with at least 5 students each. Data in BON are deidentified and this 
activity is part of routine care provided by [CONTACT_15098], so does not require special consent. 
These data will also be used to inform group consultation supporting clinicians’ practices.  
Approximately 150 parents of students working with the participating clinicians will be 
recruited and enrolled using active consent . Parents will be asked to consent to 1) 
permission to review student records for goals  and progress ; and 2)  25-minute study 
phone calls at baseline, 3- months, 6- months and 9- months to provide parent -reported 
information on engagement and child outcomes throughout treatment . These data will be 
used to assess family engagement and child outcomes associated with measurement -
based care delivered by [CONTACT_47656].  
This study will be conducted in established, commonly accepted educational settings 
where mental health services are routinely provided. The interactions between children, 
families, their SMH clinicians on school campuses are part of their regular service 
delivery. The MBC training clinicians provide will be integrated into services as usual. The 
MBC measures and practices are considered best practices, and evidence- based 
practices, for children’s mental health services . However, clinicians in  usual care settings 
including schools under -implement MBC . They do not pose any risk when integrated into 
usual care. There are no group assignments. Clinician and parent reported study

Primary Outcome Variables  
The primary objective of this study is to examine implementation outcomes . 
Implementation outcomes are selected from a published taxonomy of outcomes include 
acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity. Acceptability, appropriateness, 
and feasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_715235] -report on the Acceptability of 
Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) via web- based, clinician- report survey. These 4- item 
measures were devel oped based on input from 36 implementation scientists and 27 
mental health professionals; structural validity, test -retest reliability, and sensitivity to 
change have been established.  MBC use (fidelity)  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_715236], the Session Rating Scale 3.0 
(SRS) and Outcomes Rating Scale 3.0 (ORS). The MBC training provided as part of this 
study will include how to use MBC and document it in BON . The ORS will be completed 
before each session to assess prior -week functioning, and the SRS will be completed at 
the end of the session to assess student/parent perceptions of alliance with the clinician.  
Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables  
The secondary objective of this study is to examine effectiveness outcomes.  
Effectiveness outcomes of MBC will be measured using actual scores on the SRS and 
ORS, as documented in the student’s service record. The SRS and ORS are part of the 
Partners for Change Outcome Management System (PCOMS),  a system used to 
enhance patient involvement in mental health services and improve therapeutic alliance and treatment progress. Student engagement  will be measured by [CONTACT_203603] . Parent 
engagement will be measured by t he Therapeutic Alliance Scales for Caregivers and 
Parents . Symptoms and functioning will be measured using the ORS. Emotional and 
behavioral symptoms will also be measured by [CONTACT_182300], 35 -item 
version (PSC -35) which has well -established reliability and validity to assess and monitor 
progress of internalizing and ex ternalizing symptoms for children ages 4 -18. The 
Therapeutic Alliance Scales for Caregivers and Parents and the PSC -35 will be collected 
directly from parent s/guardians  over the phone at baseline and follow -up intervals.  
 
Study Population  
This study plans to enroll up to 150 parent s/legal guardians  of children or adolescents 
receiving SMH treatment from one of the 50 participating clinicians. We anticipate SMH 
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
5 clinicians to be primarily licensed, Masters -level (~95%), in fields of social work (~70%) 
and counseling (~30%), female (~80%), Caucasian (~70%), median age of [ADDRESS_974242]  and served by a participating 
SMH clinician. We anticipate parents to be primarily female ( ~70%) and their children to 
be representative of students served by [CONTACT_715237].  
Number of Participants  
We plan to work with  [ADDRESS_974243] a subset of their caseload for MBC implementation. 
Clinicians will introduce the opportunity to participate in the study to the parents of the 
students they implement MBC with.  
Study Schedule  
Clinician  participation will require approximately 9  hours of study participation during the 
2021- 22 or 2022 -23 school year . This includes 6  hours of training and ongoing 
consultation (e.g., 6, 60- minute post -training group consultation calls) plus 2 hours and 30 
minutes of online surveys (five surveys in total; one baseline survey before the study 
begins, one post -training survey, and then follow- ups at 3 months, 6 months and 9 
months).   
 
Parent/guardian participation will require approximately 1 hour, 4 0 minutes of study 
participation during the 2021- 22 or 2022 -23 school year . This includes phone consent and 
four phone interviews of approximately 20- 25 minutes each at baseline, 3 months, 6 
months and 9 months.

6 Protocol Revision History  
Version 
Date  Summary of Substantial Changes  
8/1/[ADDRESS_974244] -wide, 3 -hour training on measurement- based care (MBC). 
The revised protocol waives documentation of consent for clinicians.  Instead, 
clinicians will receive an informational email from their district leader about 
this project as a district -wide quality improvement initiative to implement 
measurement -based care (MBC). The revised protocol includes the [ADDRESS_974245]. A waiver of documentation of consent is appropriate due to the low-
risk nature of the study and no assignment to different study conditions; all 
clinicians receive training and support  for MBC implementation. This change 
is at the request of our district partners (see two support letters) to include 
more clinicians in the project because they are implementing MBC as part of routine care in the schools. This change has also been documented with NIMH. There will be no impact on data safety or monitoring plan, methods/procedures of the study, or budget. Parents of children served will still be consented to study participation, involving phone surveys of child outcomes  and permission to acce ss basic service data (see below) , which is 
optional.  
2. Previously we stated that progress notes in medical records would be accessed from the school site and reviewed. We learned that session by [CONTACT_715238] -based services does not exist in this way. 
Therefore, the current modification refle cts updated language about 
requesting parental consent to request basic treatment information about 
their student such as diagnosis, goals, and any documentation of progress 
using the online system (Better Outcomes Now or BON) we are training them on. All student data are entered in a deidentified manner to BON as a part of routine services provided, and our team has administrator access to BON to provide ongoing consultation for clinicians about how to use the system clinically. For parents who consent to study participation, we will ask clinicians and/or their supervisors to securely transfer basic student services information (e.g., diagnosis, goals, services start date) and their BON identifier so we can review their progress data and link it to parent -reported 
outcomes. There is no change to patient safety and in fact we anticipate parents may view this as less invasive than access to progress notes in medical records because we are now asking for access to more basic and less sensitive PHI and treatment -related data.  
3. We added the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (Demerouti & Mostert, 2010)  to 
the clinician survey to assess for impact of training on staff wellbeing, and 
staff wellbeing as a potential moderator of implementation outcomes.

11 1 Background/Literature Review  
1.[ADDRESS_974250] several decades.  
[SUPPORTING LITERATURE REDACTED]   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_715220], school mental health treatment quality is 
inconsistent.  [SUPPORTING LITERATURE REDACTED] . One evidence -based approach 
to improve the quality SMH services is increasing clinicians’ use of symptom rating scales at 
the beginning and throughout treatment to drive clinical decision making and chart progress. 
This practice is referred to as measurement -based care (MBC),  or the routine collection and 
use of student data throughout treatment, including initial screening and assessment, problem definition and analysis, finalizing treatment objectives and intervention tactics, and 
monitoring treatment progress . [SUPPORTING LITERATURE REDACTED]  
MBC is an effective, evidence- based practice to improve treatment quality. 
[SUPPORTING LITERATURE REDACTED]  
Although there is strong support for MBC in primary care and community settings, including 
some studies with children, MBC effectiveness in SMH has not been rigorously tested. 
Moreover, the mechanisms of MBC effects on patient outcomes are not well known. We 
propose to pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a set of implementation strategies  (that were identified in a previous aim 
of this same grant award)  to increase school mental health (SMH) clinician use of 
measurement -based care (MBC), and further explore the effectiveness of MBC  on 
student/family engagement and child outcomes.  
1.[ADDRESS_974251] identify  the implementation 
strategies  being tested in this  current  study phase. In the prior study aim, 52 SMH 
Stakeholder Expert Panelists (i.e., SMH clinicians, supervisors, and researchers who 
actively partner with schools ) were purposively sampled using the National SMH Census, a 
nationally -representative survey of SMH school and district teams’ services and data usage. 
Using a modified Delphi technique, panelists reviewed the definition of MBC as well as 
clinical vignettes demonstrating how MBC would be used by a clinician providing mental 
health treatment to students. Then, panelists responded to two rounds of online surveys to 
1) rate an existing list of 33 implementation strategies for feasibility and importance, 2) 
identify synonyms, definition changes, and recommendations about how the strategy should 
be used, and 3) suggested additional strategies not on the existing list. Mix ed methods 
analysis and GoZone plots revealed six top -rated implementation strategies for MBC in 
schools, which include the following:  
1. Assess for readiness and identify barriers and facilitators  
2. Identify and prepare champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]  
3. Develop a usable implementation plan  
4. Offer a clinician -informed menu of free, brief measures  
5. Develop and provide access to training materials  
6. Make implementation easier by [CONTACT_715239] -rated strategies will be the foundation of the implementation strategy package 
being tested in the current FOCUSS study. As a result of strategy #1 above, baseline 
clinician surveys will include a needs assessment to inform additional implementat ion 
strategies and/or tailoring of strategies that should be applied.  
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
[ADDRESS_974252], clinicians report ed it is 
more important and more feasible to make implementation easier by [CONTACT_715240] (feasibility t(44)= -2.96, p=0.01; importance (t(29)= -2.72, p=0.01). Second, 
researchers reported it’s more important to monitor the implementation effo rt (t(41)=2.51, 
p=0.02).Third, clinicians reported train- the-trainer is more feasible (t(45)= -2.06, p=0.05).  
In addition to this prior research, [CONTACT_715267] has also led several implementation studies 
with school district personnel to implement various elements of MBC in the past.  
 
2 Rationale/Significance  
2.[ADDRESS_974253] that the evidence- base of SMH services is highly inconsistent , this  has deleterious 
effects on the welfare of all students. The routine use of psychosocial symptom and 
functioning assessment data (MBC) to inform SMH treatment is an effective, evidence -based 
practice that can improve service quality at low cost. In practice, clinicians over -rely on 
clinical judgment and have little time to learn and use more effective practices. It is 
imperative that we change clinician practice to include MBC. The proposed research 
includes cutting -edge implementation science methods to identify and test the most 
promising strategies to increase MBC practice in the school context. This study seeks to 
generate initial knowledge about contextually -specific implementation  strategies to increase 
school -based clinicians’ use of MBC with their patients.  
2.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact  
The goals of this study are to collect preliminary data on implementation outcomes 
associated with  MBC  implementation strategies identified in our prior research, as well as on 
effectiveness of MBC to improve student engagement and treatment outcomes. The logic for this line of research is that the right implementation strategies will produce desired 
implementation outcomes, most importantly clinician fidelity (i. e., use of MBC in their 
practice). The effect of implementation strategies on MBC use is likely mediated by [CONTACT_715241], appropriate, and feasible MBC is rated by [CONTACT_15098] (key implementation 
outcomes that will be measured). MBC use is hypothesized to improve student progress and 
outcomes such as reduced symptoms and improved functioning, possibly through the 
mechanism of engagement.  
If successful, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_222593] a foundation for future investigation to determine 
exactly how MBC can be implemented in “real world” SMH services, which could have a 
dramatic public health impact on the quality of mental health services recei ved by [CONTACT_715242]. This study also has the potential to generate generalizable 
knowledge about the impact of MBC on student engagement and treatment outcomes, to further bolster the growing evidence- base of MBC effectiveness with children and 
adolescents.  
2.[ADDRESS_974254] access to the link between the ID and participant ’s name. All data 
security procedures commensurate with the clinical and/or school site’s maintenance of

[ADDRESS_974255] 
to the participating agency and secure data transfer. Electronic data files with identifiable 
information will be maintained separately from other data files and will only be used for 
administrative purposes (e.g., preparing aggregate reports to share with the study team). 
Data containing names and personal information will never be included in published 
materials.  All personnel will receive certification in human subjects’ protection from the Yale 
HRPP  prior to beginning work on this project.  
 
Risks related to Clinicians participating in training and implementation supports and 
providing feedback via electronic surveys. The risk from participating in MBC training and 
implementation supports and providing feedback via electronic surveys for clinicians is 
minimal and relatively uncommon. T he information page will ensure clinicians  are aware that 
their responses to implementation feedback surveys will only be shared in aggregate and will 
not affect their employment or performance review in any way. Moreover, clinical 
administ rators will not be included in the data collection process  whereby [CONTACT_715243]-reported  implementation experiences and outcomes . At the start of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_715221]. District leadership will know which participants are 
involved in the project because they will attend district -organized professional development 
trainings and consultation. However, all clinician- reported survey  data regarding their 
implementation experiences will be coded with an ID number that is unique. Only the study 
team will have access to the link between the ID and participant’s name. Electronic data files 
with identifiable information will be maintained separately from other data files and will only 
be used for administrative purposes (e.g., preparing aggregate reports to share with the 
study team). Data containing names and personal information will never be included in published materials.  All personnel will receive certification in human subjects’ protection from 
the Yale HRPP prior to beginning work on this project.  
2.3.2  Potential Benefits  
Clinicians  and the students/patients  they serve will be offered a potentially effective 
intervention for collaboratively monitoring their progress in mental health treatment over 
time. Clinician participants who use the measurement -based care processes that they will be 
trained and supported  to use will have the opportunity to learn an evidence -based practice 
they can use with any of their patients as they wish. Clinicians will also receive one year user 
access to Better Outcomes Now ( www.betteroutcomesnow.com ) which is an online system 
to collect, score, view and discuss student progress on the Outcome Rating Scale and 
Session Rating Scale. They will receive training and consultation on how to use this 
evidence- based, practical system with students and families, whether you are meeting with 
them virtually or in person.  
Children and parents  who engage in the measurement -based care processes that clinicians 
will be trained and supported to use may experience greater therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/patient alliance and 
improvement in symptoms and functioning at the end of treatment. We feel the potential 
benefits t o be gained outweighs the risks of the study.  
 
3 Study Purpose and Objectives  
3.1 Hypothesis  
Hypothesis 1:  Clinicians’ ratings of MBC implementation outcomes will increase following 
implementation strategies provided as compared to ratings during the baseline period. 
(Primary Objective)  
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
14 Hypothesis 2:  MBC fidelity (per MBC feedback system  review ) and use (per clinician self -
report ) will increase following implementation strategies provided as compared to ratings 
during the baseline period, with documentation of measure collection more prevalent than 
documentation of discussing progress or changing the treatment plan in accordance w ith 
measures. (Primary Objective)  
Hypothesis 3:  MBC fidelity  and use  will be positively associated with engagement  and 
mental health symptom and functioning progress over time. (Secondary Objective)  
Although underpowered to establish outcomes as a result of strategies applied with certainty, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_715222] a future large- scale hybrid trial.  
3.2 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a multi -method implementation 
support package will help school -based mental health clinicians use MBC strategies, as 
measured by [CONTACT_715233] (e.g., feasibility, acceptability, appr opriateness, 
and use or fidelity) with K -[ADDRESS_974256] leadership to promote implementation (e.g., 
by [CONTACT_715234]).  I hypothesize that clinicians’ ratings 
of MBC implementation outcomes will increase following the implementation strategies 
provided as compared to their ratings during the baseline period without strategies  and 
fidelity (i.e., use of) MBC with students served in SMH treatment.  
3.3 Secondary O bjective  
The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether MBC implementation in 
schools is associated with engagement in treatment and student outcomes (i.e., reduction in 
symptoms and improvements in functioning) over the course of SMH treatment.   
[ADDRESS_974257] of the 
implementation support condition on clinicians’ fidelity, use  and ratings of MBC 
appropriateness, acceptability and fidelity. Approximately 50 SMH clinicians will be recruited 
to participate from two  school districts.  All clinicians will receive the same implementation 
supports; there is no random assignment to condition. Following an initial control period of at 
least 1 month, school districts will start receiving implementation supports. During the initial 
control period, baseline MBC use, attitudes, acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness 
(per clinician self -report) will be collected, as well as needs assessment data from clinician 
surveys to inform necessary adjustment s to the implementation supports. Baseline 
engagement and student outcomes will be collected after initial clinician training session. 
MBC implementation outcomes (i.e., MBC use, attitudes, acceptability, appropriateness, and 
feasibility), engagement and s tudent outcomes will be collected at [ADDRESS_974258] ratings of implementation outcomes for all N= [ADDRESS_974259] ratings of engagement and student 
outcomes, and between- agency differences.  
Study Date Range and Duration  
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
[ADDRESS_974260] approximately one calendar year from recruitment to follow -up, 
aligned with the 2021- 2022 and 2022 -23 academic years as the participating sites are 
school districts. Clinicians will start training and consultation in the fall of 2021 or 2022 and  
parents/guardians  will be recruited in the fall of 2021 or 2022.  Data collection will occur at 
baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 9 months.

4.2 Outcome Variables  
4.2.1  Primary Outcome Variables  
The primary objective of this study is to examine implementation outcomes. Implementation 
outcomes are selected from a published taxonomy of outcomes include acceptability, 
appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity. Acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility will 
be measured by [CONTACT_715235] -report on the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), 
Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) 
via web -based, clinician- report survey. These 4- item measures were developed based on 
input from 36 implementation scientists and 27 mental health professionals; structural 
validity, test -retest reliability, and sensitivity to change have been established. MBC use 
(fidelity) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_715244], the Session Rating Scale 3.0 (SRS) and Outcomes Rating Scale 3.0 (ORS). The 
ORS  should be completed before each session to assess prior -week functioning, and the 
SRS will be completed at the end of the session to assess student/parent perceptions of alliance with the clinician. These will be stored in the Better Outcomes Now (BON) secure 
online system.   
4.2.2  Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables  
The secondary objective of this study is to examine effectiveness outcomes. Effectiveness 
outcomes  of MBC will be measured using actual scores on the SRS and ORS, as 
documented in the student’s service record. The SRS and ORS are part of the Partners for 
Change Outcome Management System (PCOMS), a system used to enhance patient 
involvement in mental he alth services and improve therapeutic alliance and treatment 
progress. Student engagement  will be measured by [CONTACT_203603]. Parent engagement  will be 
measured by t he Therapeutic Alliance Scales for Caregivers and Parents. Symptoms and 
functioning  will be measured using the ORS. Emotional and behavioral symptoms will also 
be measured by [CONTACT_182300], 35- item version (PSC -35) which has well -
established reliability and validity to assess and monitor progress of internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms for children ages 4 -18. The Therapeutic Alliance Scales for 
Caregivers and Parents and the PSC -35 will be collected directly from parents/guardians  
over the phone at baseline and follow -up intervals.  
4.3 Study Population  
This study plans to enroll 50 SMH clinicians and 150 parents/guardians  of children or 
adolescents receiving SMH treatment from one of the 50 participating clinicians. We 
anticipate SMH clinicians to be primarily licensed, Masters -level (~95%), in fields of social 
work (~70%) and counseling (~30%), female (~80%), Caucasian (~70%), median age of [ADDRESS_974261] and served by a 
participating SMH clinician. We anticipate parents to be primarily female (~70%) and their children to be representative of students served by [CONTACT_715245].  
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
[ADDRESS_974262] a subset of their 
caseload for MBC implementation. We will outreach to students the clinician reports they are 
using MBC with. Selection of a subset of cases will involve a random selection of recently 
consented cases.  
4.3.2  Eligibility Criteria/Vulnerable Populations  
Parent/Guardian Participants  
To be eligible for inclusion in the study, a parent or legal guardian  must meet all of the 
following criteria:  
• Female, male or other gender ≥18 years of age at the time of recruitment . 
• Parent or legal guardian of a child age 5 to 18 at the time of recruitment who is 
enrolled in school -based mental health treatment services with one of the clinician 
participants included in the study (see inclusion criteria for clinician participants abov e). 
• Enrolled in school -based mental health services within 3 months prior to the 
recruitment date.  
• English speaking.  
• Ability to provide informed consent.  
Parents/guardians  who do not meet all inclusion criteria are excluded. There are no other 
exclusion criteria.  
 
5 Study Methods/Procedures  
5.1 Study Procedures  
Study procedures involve collecting implementation data from clinician s (approximately 
N=50) as part of a district -wide measurement -based care training in initiative and recruiting 
parent/guardian (up to N=150) participants  to provide feedback on the implementation 
outcomes of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_715223] -training consultation on measurement -based care . 
Study information will be provided to  clinicians via email and secure, electronic survey  and 
study consent will be provided to parents/guardians  by a study team member conducting 
phone consent.  Study procedures are built around a 3-hour professional development and 
monthly, post -training consultation calls  that are required by [CONTACT_715246] s. 
Clinicians will also be asked to use  MBC measures (e.g., Outcome Rating Scale and 
Session Rating Scale) with 5 students on their caseload, and completing study evaluation 
surveys (for which clinicians will be compensated with $[ADDRESS_974263] -training, 3- , 6-, and 9- month follow -up). 
Parents/guardians  of youth served by [CONTACT_715247] (at baseline, 3- , 6-, and 9 -month intervals) to report child symptoms and 
parent engagement. Parent/guardian participants will also be asked to consent to records

[ADDRESS_974264] of Care  
Youth (ages 5 -18) who receive school -based mental health services from participating 
clinicians will receive measurement -based care (MBC) as part of their usual care services. 
MBC is aligned with best practices in psychosocial treatment delivery but  is under -
implemented in usual care due to numerous barriers. MBC practices, which include routine 
progress monitoring and feedback to inform data- driven, client -centered treatment plan 
adjustments, only stands to improve the quality and standard of usual care delivered to 
children and their families in school settings.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_974265] copy research records will be scanned and saved electronically on a Yale 
secure server before shredding the paper copy. Data sources  will include:  
(1) Quantitative data from clinician self -report surveys about MBC acceptability, 
appropriateness, and feasibility as well as MBC use every three months during 
implementation supports. Some qualitative feedback will also be solicited on the survey for clinicians to expand on any details the standardized measures of these 
implementation outcomes could not capture.  (Primary outcome variables)  
(2) Quantitative data on MBC use (clinician fidelity)  coded by [CONTACT_715248], in 
which fidelity includes presence of SRS and ORS measures in the online BON/ PCOMS system to approximate fidelity per clinician. (Primary outcome 
variables)  
(3) Quantitative data on proximal and distal student engagement and functioning 
outcomes  collected by [CONTACT_715249], retrieved from medical 
records and/or the PCOMS system directly (SRS, ORS) . (Secondary outcome 
variables)  
(4) Quantitative data on  parent engagement  and distal student symptoms collected by 
[CONTACT_715250] ( Therapeutic 
Alliance Scales, PSC -35). (Secondary outcome variables)  
(5) Tracking data on parent  recruitment , clinician attendance /engagement in 
implementation supports . (Implementation mechanisms)

Secure Data Recording and Maintenance:  
Online survey data will be maintained in the PI’s Yale Qualtrics account, accessible only by 
[CONTACT_715251]. Online survey data will be 
downloaded and maintained on secure Yale storage servers and networks (i.e., Yale Box, 
network drive). Clinicians will provide their identifying information (name, email address) 
when they consent as well as a secure [ADDRESS_974267] (study site). We only need basic information such as 
child diagnosis, date entered services, treatment goals, and number of sessions attended. 
We will also ask for their anonymous BON code so we can link those data (see below). 
Consistent with best practices in chart review methodology, we will work with each district to 
identify a “data extractor” at their site who can obtain the relevant data  for students of 
consented parents  within the requisite time frame and prepare them for the study team. Our 
team will provide a list of names of children based on parental consent obtained, as well as 
the data we are requesting.  Once we receive the chart data, we will deidentify it with a 
unique study identifier and keep the list of linked study IDs to names in a separate 
password- protected file. We expect that  the requested chart review material can be 
transferred in electronic format to our site at Yale, we will use Yale’s secure file transfer system, save the material on our secure Yale storage server or network, and then complete 
the enter the services data for each child. These files  will be saved on our secure Yale 
storage server and network and entered into a database.  
BON/ PCOMS system data (including the Outcome Rating Scale and Session Rating Scale) 
will be maintained in the Better Outcomes Now (www.betteroutcomesnow.com) secure 
online system. Clinicians enter these data directly into PCOMS using their own anonymous 
code for students. Ther e are no identifiable information in PCOMS. Our study team will be

study team will not share the names of consented families with clinicians in order to access 
their PCOMS data. Instead, we will use aggregate, deidentified PCOM S data at the clinician 
level to estimate MBC fidelity. This is a HIPAA -compliant site developed specifically for 
secure progress monitoring data entry and viewing my clinicians and their clients.  
Parent -reported data collected via study phone calls will be recorded in “real time” by 
[CONTACT_715252]. All hard copy record forms will be scanned in and saved electronically on a Yale secure 
server before hard copy records are shredded. Parent -reported data will be entered into 
SPSS and saved on a Yale secure server.  
The highest standards of participant confidentiality will be kept, and no participants will have 
identifiable information available. Computerized records of data are kept in a password- only 
accessible computer in a locked room. Appropriate firewalls and pr otections of computerized 
data are maintained to ensure that entry by [CONTACT_715253]. Only study team members (the PI, her mentor, and her research assistant) will 
have access to individually identifiable private inform ation about human subjects, which will 
only be used for tracking and follow -up purposes until data collection and compensation 
procedures are finalized.  
 
5.1.2  Adverse Events Definition and Reporting  
This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving 
Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the 
unlikely event that such events occur, Reportable Events (which are event s that are serious 
or life -threatening and unanticipated, or anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency 
than expected) and/or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others that 
may require a temporary or permanent interruption of study activities will be reported 
immediately (if possible), followed by a written report within 5 calendar days of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20866] (using the appropriate forms from the 
website) and any appropriate funding and regulatory agencies. [CONTACT_715267] will apprise 
fellow investigators and study personnel of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_715224].  [CONTACT_715267]  will be responsible for monitoring 
the data and assuring protocol compliance and safety reviews. She will conduct these reviews during her weekly supervision with research staff. Study staff will be trained to 
inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_715225] a timely fashion. [CONTACT_715267]  
will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require 
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment based on the severity of the event.  
5.[ADDRESS_974269]  activities listed on Clinician Information Sheet will include:  
• A 3-hour interactive training  on measurement -based care in schools. This training 
will include how to collect, score, and use student - and parent -reported progress 
measures with students and families to improve engagement, personalize services 
and inform intervention planning and adjustments throughout the school year.  
• Six, [ADDRESS_974270] -training consultation calls for six months following 
the training. These calls will be with other participating clinicians and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_715226] -based care in 
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
20 schools. Strategies and adaptations to match the school setting and student and 
family strengths and needs will be discussed.  
• Four, [ADDRESS_974271] training and 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months  after the 
training throughout the school year. You will receive a $[ADDRESS_974272] for each 
survey you complete .  
• Collecting student  progress data.  You will be asked to collect brief measures of 
student progress periodically throughout treatment, review it with the student and 
family and document this in an online system that we will grant you access to called Better Outcomes Now (BON). Collecting and discussing these measures  will take [ADDRESS_974273] five (5) of your 
students.  
• Parent recruitment.  We will ask you to refer at least five (5) parents to the research 
study component of this project. We will ask you to present the opportunity to 
participate in the study to the parents of students you work with. Parent participation is optional and will involve completing four brief phone check ins with one of our 
study team members during the school year. Parents will receive a $[ADDRESS_974274] for each phone check in they complete. If the parent agrees to participate, the 
study team will also review their BON account for documentation of measures being 
collected and discussed. We will do this by [CONTACT_715254]. (As 
administrators, we can access  all BON data, but it is deidentified). Records review in 
BON will occur confidentially by [CONTACT_715255].  
 
Parent/guardian  participation  will require approximately 1 hour, 4 0 minutes of study 
participation during the 2021- 22 or 2022 -23 school year.  This includes phone consent and 
four phone interviews of approximately 20- 25 minutes each at baseline, 3 months, 6 months 
and 9 months.  
5.3 Informed Consent  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are 
given to the participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to 
starting intervention/administering study intervention. Study information will be provided via 
online survey for clinicians  and study consent will be provided over the phone for parents. 
The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol:  
• Clinician Information Form  
• Parent Consent from  
 
5.2.1  Screening (if applicable)  
Not applicable.  
5.2.2  Recruitment, Enrollment and Retention (if applicable)  
5.3.3  Clinician Participants  
Clinicians (N= 50) who provide psychosocial interventions to K -[ADDRESS_974275]  using the following steps:  
1. Clinicians receive an email from their supervisor (e.g., a “site leader” which could be a district or community mental health agency administrator, depending on whether 
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
21 they are school - or community -employed) that the FOCUSS study team will contact 
[CONTACT_715256]. See “Clinician Notice of FOCUSS Study Email from 
Site Leader”  . This will include “FOCUSS Flyer –  Clinician”.  
2. Site leaders will send the study team a list of names and email addresses of eligible 
clinicians .  
3. Study team members will email clinicians directly with the “ FOCUSS Flyer – 
Clinician” form attached. The email message will remind clinicians  about the project  
and include a link to the first online survey . See “Qualtrics Invitation Email from Study 
Team – Clinicians”  
4. Clinicians can view the Clinician Information Sheet and FOCUSS Flyer -Clinician on 
the first page of  the online Qualtrics survey  and provide contact [CONTACT_715257].  
5. Two ( 2) reminders will be sent to clinicians who do not open the survey link . All 
clinicians will receive emails about  the [ADDRESS_974276] survey .  
 
Parent/Guardian Participants  
Consent will be collected over the  phone for parents. Parent/guardians (N=150) who have a 
child receiving school -based mental health treatment from one of the participating clinicians 
will be recruit ed and consented using the following steps:  
1. The clinician and/or designated site clinical staff will ask the parent/ guardian of each 
recruited student  if they are willing to be contact[CONTACT_38435]. They will do 
this using the “Clinician Parent/Guardian Recruitment Script” . 
2. If so, the parent’s contact [CONTACT_715258] “Research Interest Sheet –  FOCUSS”, who will contact [CONTACT_715259]/or email  and then  introduce the study , read the consent form, and 
request informed consent  over the phone .  
3. The study team member will indicate the parent’s consent (yes or no), and if yes, 
document the parent’s  name, relationship to child, date, and their name [CONTACT_163061].  
Study Visits  (if applicable)  
We will conduct study phone calls with parents at baseline, [ADDRESS_974277] approximately 20 -25 minutes. Parents will be asked to 
provide ratings over the phone about their engagement in their child’s mental health services 
and their child’s mental health symptoms .  
5.3 Statistical Method  
5.3.1  Statistical Design  
Quantitative Analyses  
Quality control checks of the data and examination of variable distributions will be performed 
prior to formal analysis. There are three  types of outcomes: (1) clinician report of 
acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility (implementation outcomes), (2) clinician use of MBC (also an implementation outcome, fidelity), and (3) student engagement, progress and 
outcomes (effectiveness of MBC). For (1)  and (2) , the primary analysis will be a  multilevel 
growth model with time (Level 1) nested within clinician (Level 2) for each of the 
implementation outcomes as they are clinician self -reported on clinician surveys. We will 
examine linear change of time as a continuous measure as well as time by [CONTACT_715260]. Attitudes toward MBC and other 
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
22 independent variables (e.g., clinician professional and demographic characteristics, 
consultation call attendance, school district) will be entered into the models to examine 
correlations. In particular, we hypothesize parallel growth between attitudes and use of MBC 
over time.  
For (3) we will conduct a 3- Level multilevel growth model with time (Level 1) nested within 
student/parent reported outcome (Level 1) nested within clinician (Level 3). Models will be 
estimated for each parent -reported outcome (e.g., parent -reported engagement, parent -
reported symptoms on the PSC -35). Independent variables that will be entered as covariates 
in these models include MBC implementation outcomes, with the specific hypothesis that 
MBC use will be predictive of positive engagement and symptom reduction.  
Also, for (3), the ORS and SRS are assessed at each session, hence, a mixed effects 
regression model will be used that accounts for intra- student correlation across student 
sessions and clustering of students within clinician. The unit of analysis will be session, 
however in primary analyses, to avoid an overly complicated model, session will not be 
modeled as a fixed effect in the regression model for the mean. Fixed effects will include 
time (baseline and post MP assessment for MP1, 2, or 3) and treatment  condition (i.e. 
whether the clinician’s agency is under the intervention or control condition).  
Results of all the above analyses will be expressed in terms of 95% confidence intervals for effects and contrasts which together with estimates of intra -clinician correlation and variance 
will inform the power analysis for a larger trial.   
Mixed Methods Analyses 
For (2) we will also analyze chart review data. We will develop and test our MBC fidelity 
rubric on a subset of consented students at midpoint in the school year to assess intercoder 
reliability, test our coding form on the text of progress notes, and refi ne both our coding form 
and process for accessing records in an efficient, reliable manner. These analyses will yield 
mixed methods data on clinician use of MBC to be triangulated with clinician self -reported 
use of MBC on surveys to evaluate relative advantages and disadvantages of these methods to assess use of MBC. Qualitative data generated from chart reviews will be 
analyzed using Rapid Qualitative Analysis whereby [CONTACT_715261] [INVESTIGATOR_715227] a standard summary form, which is 
then entered into a matrix for the entire sample to be reviewed, coded iteratively, and 
synthesized for main themes and sub codes. These findings will directly inform the future 
R01 application methods regarding the collec tion and use of chart review and/or clinician 
surveys to assess MBC use/fidelity following implementation supports.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_974278] Characteristics (if applicable)  
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
23 Quality control checks of the data and examination of variable distributions will be performed 
prior to formal analysis.  Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations will be examined for all 
datasets. Demographic characteristics of clinician participants and parent/guardian 
participants will be examined and reported in all scholarly reports and products. If any 
demographic characteristics are significantly related to implementation or effectiveness 
outcomes, they will be entered as control variables in the linear mixed analyses.  
5.3.5  Interim Analysis (if applicable)  
Not applicable.  
5.3.6  Handling of Missing Data 
Missing data will be analyzed to examine any patterns of missingness not at random, 
including case- wise (i.e., overall percentage, patterns, various longitudinal intervals of 
missingness) and variable- wise (i.e., overall percentage, patterns) missing values analysis. 
Linear mixed modeling is robust to missing data and does not require listwise deletion of 
cases with missing data. Therefore, if missing data are missing at random (MAR) all data will 
be us ed. Otherwise, analyses with and without missing data will be compared to examine 
whether results differ when including cases and variables with data missing not at random.  
6 Trial Administration  
6.1 Ethical Considerations: Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved and the participant/legally 
authorized representative (LAR) will be asked to read and review the document.  
 For clinician s, the online survey will contain the Clinician Information Sheet  to explain the 
project  and answer  contact [CONTACT_715262]. A copy of the Clinician Information Sheet  will also be emailed to the 
participants/LAR for their records  
 For parent participants, c onsent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved and 
the participant/LAR will be asked to read and review the document. The study team member  
will explain the research study to the parent or guardian and answer any questions that may 
arise. This conversation will take place in a private room or over a private zoom call due to 
COVID -19 restrictions. Participants/LAR will have the opportunity to carefully review the 
written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants/LAR will have the 
opportunity to discuss the study with their family or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The parent o r guardian will indicate their consent via verbal authorization with 
the research study team member  prior to any procedures being done specifically for the 
study. Participants/LAR will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent 
document will be given to the participants/LAR for their records  
 Additional consent details are as follows:  
- No deception will be used .  
- Clinicians  will be compensated up to $ 100 via Amazon Gift Cards for their 
participation. Parent  participants will be compensated up to $[ADDRESS_974279]- protected, Yale- approved network 
locations in a locked room with participants’ evaluation study materials identified by 
[CONTACT_233780]. A separate file will hold the password. Appropriate firewalls and 
protections of computerized data are maintained to ensure that entry by [CONTACT_715263] [PHONE_14863]  
 
24 than research personnel is not possible. Only study team members (the PI, her 
mentor, and her research assistant) will have access to individually identifiable 
private information about human subjects, which will only be used for tracking and 
follow- up pur poses until data collection and compensation procedures are finalized.  
- Participants will not be personally identified in any publications or reports of the study. Any data used will be re- copi[INVESTIGATOR_715228]. The highest standards of participant confidentiality will be kept, and no 
participants will have identifiable information available.  
- Parent s enrolled will be asked to agree report symptom data on the Pediatric 
Symptom Checklist, 35 items (PSC -35) as well as to access  their students’ progress, 
goals, and related services data from  documentation maintained by  [CONTACT_137021] .As 
such, at least one family member or guardian will consent to secondary data collection and record review from their students’ treatment record.  
- Child consent will not be  obtained.  
6.[ADDRESS_974280] (IRB) Review  
The protocol will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of the protocol 
must be obtained before initiating any research activity. Any change to the protocol or study team will require an approved IRB amendment before implementation. The  IRB will 
determine whether informed consent and HIPAA authorization are required.  All reportable 
events and unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_974281] (IRB), or regulatory 
agencies may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_1275], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospit al) for the 
participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
 
The study participant's contact [CONTACT_65246].  All data will be stored on Yale secure file storage platforms 
and servers, with password protection and accessible only to the study team. Our team will 
not retain any paper copy study records; any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_715229], saved 
electronically, then shredded. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a 
secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional policies, 
or, if applicable, sponsor requirements.  
 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 
reporting, will be transmitted to and stored at Yale University, Department of Psychiatry, 
Division of Prevention and Community Research . This will not include the participant's 
contact [CONTACT_1290]. Rather, individual participants and their research data will 
be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study

[ADDRESS_974282] protected. At the end of the study, 
all study databases will be de- identified and archived at Yale University .  
 
6.4 Deviations/Unanticipated Problems  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the study protocol. The noncompliance may 
be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of 
deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to identify and report deviations [ADDRESS_974283] 
(IRB) per their policies.  
 
Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others include, in general, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have

• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) and to the study sponsor. The UP report will include the following 
information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI's name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following 
timeline:  
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and study 
sponsor, if applicable within [insert timeline in accordance with of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and study sponsor within [insert timeline in accordance with policy] of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_8706]'s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and 
the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within & [insert timeline in 
accordance with policy] of the IRB's receipt of the report of the problem from the 
investigator.  
6.5 Data Quality Assurance

6.8 Data or Specimen Storage/Security  
See Section 5.5.1 “Secure Data Recording and Maintenance” .  
6.9 Retention of Records  
Study records  (both deidentified data and password- protected file with links to identifiers)  will 
be retained for a minimum of three (3) years after the completion of the study. All records will 
be electronic. The PI ([CONTACT_715267]) will need to be contact[CONTACT_715265]. 
The master list linking the unique study identification num ber to the research data will be 
destroyed after all analyses are completed.   
6.10 Study Monitoring  
The data safety and monitoring plan is consistent with what is required for clinical trials 
funded by [CONTACT_52042] , as follows:  
The PI (Connors) is ultimately responsible for study monitoring to ensure the safety of 
participants and the validity and integrity of the data. With assistance from the primary 
mentor (Tebes), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_715231], data integrity, confidentiality, and protection of participants’ safety.  
Data and Safety Monitoring will be overseen by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
established for this study. The Board will be comprised of three investigators at Yale with 
relevant research expertise in mental health services research and/or implementation 
Protocol Number [PHONE_14863]  
 
27 science who are two full professors and one associate professor of psychiatry (psychology). 
One member’s expertise is in implementation science and community -engaged research 
with children and families and is a former member of Yale School of Medicine’s IR B (the 
Yale Human Subjects Committee, or HSC). Another member’s expertise is in school -based 
research focused on the implementation and evaluation of social emotional learning 
programs with children, families, and school personnel. The third member’s exper tise is in 
applied, community -partnered research to promote mental health and wellness and prevent 
substance use with a focus on issues pertaining to equity, social justice and systemic 
oppression for marginalized and underrepresented groups. All are knowl edgeable about the 
responsible conduct of research with children, families, and community -based organizations.  
The DSMB will meet annually in person to review study procedures, including: 1) the study 
protocol; 2) the consent form; 3) occurrences of side effects/adverse events; and 4) the 
study data management system. As needed, the three investigators comprising the DSMB 
will meet without ex -officio members for closed discussions about serious adverse events 
(SAE). As needed, the DSMB will review de- identified data, but may review identified data 
when discussing SAEs. The DSMB will also be notified of the occurrenc e of any adverse 
events (AE) and SAEs, and may choose to meet on an ad hoc basis when notified of either 
of these events. DSMB members will also be notified when AEs and SAEs are reported to 
the Yale IRB.  
6.11 Study Modification  
Any study modifications will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval with a revised 
protocol. Changes will not be implemented in the study until modifications are approved.  
6.12 Study Completion  
The study will be completed on or before June 30 , 2023. Data collection will be completed 
by [CONTACT_11713] 30, 2023 , with data cleaning, analysis and reporting to follow. We will notify the IRB 
when the study is completed and submit a closure report or other required paperwork at that 
time to close the study.

actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, 
publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and managed. Furthermore, persons 
who have a perceived conflict of interest wi ll be required to have such conflicts managed in a 
way that is appropriate to their participation in the trial. The study leadership in conjunction 
with the appropriate conflict of interest review committee has established policies and 
procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish 
a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.  
 
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with this study (patent ownership, royalties, or 
financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385], etc.) must have the 
conflict reviewed by a Quality Assurance Committee from YCCI or the Psychiatry 
Department  with a Committee -sanctioned conflict management plan that has been reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_28833]. All investigators will 
follow the applicable conflict of interest policies.

independent variables. No analyses will report subgroups small enough such that any individual participant would be potentially identifiable (e.g., school counselor in an 
elementary school in a named district may be too identifying in a small district ). If illustrative 
cases appear in publications, presentations or other reports, care will be taken to ensure 
details provided are in no way a disclosure of identifiable information. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_715232]. Per  the funder’s guidelines, all published

Efficacy Discontinuation Criteria at Week 12, 16, or 20 : 
Any subject with <  20% improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender 
joint count (SJC and TJC; 66/68 counts) at any of the visits at week 12, 16 or 20 
will discontinue from the trial , but remain blinded to study drug assignment. The 
visit at which subjects will meet the efficacy discontinuation criteria,  is defined as 
the Early Termination Visit  for these patients . Following this Early Termination Visit, 
any future care will then be pr ovided (outside of the study) at the discretion of the 
treating physician as part of usual clinical practice.  
 
The blind will be maintained until the last enrolled subject completes the final 
evaluations and the database is locked.  
 In countries where open-label extension ( OLE) study ALX0061- C203 is approved , 
subjects who complete the 24 -week assessment period of the current study will be 
invited  to roll -over. Details on the  open-label extension (OLE) study  are described 
in Clinical Study Protocol  ALX0061- C203. 
 
 
Study Population:

Statistical Methods:  
 
Sample Size and Power  
Up to approximately 330 subjects in 5  treatment arms randomized in a 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_559520] in the different ALX -0061 doses versus placebo. Assuming Week  12 ACR20 
response rates of  25%, 30 %, 45%, 55% , and 55% for placebo,  ALX-[ADDRESS_559521] s per arm will provide more 
than 90% power using the Cochran Armitage test for trend at significance level of 0.05 ( 2-sided).  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Evaluation : 
For the descriptive statistics and trend test on the primary efficacy endpoint 
(primary efficacy analysis), data will be analyzed according to the intent- to-treat 
principle; thus, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment for which they were ass igned. Subjects with missing ACR20 response at Week  12 will be treated 
as non -responders (non -responder imputation approach).  
 Additionally,  exploratory comparisons of each separate dose versus placebo will be 
conducted using a Chi² or Fisher exact test (o r other test if deemed more relevant). 
The study is only powered for testing the trend  of the primary endpoint. All other 
p-values are exploratory and no correction for multiple testing is foreseen.  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

 Primary efficacy endpoint evaluation will also be perform ed using the per -protocol 
population  as a sensitivity analysis . 
 
All Other Evaluations:  
For continuous secondary efficacy endpoints (including DAS28, CDAI, SDAI), summary statistics, such as mean with standard deviation and median  and 
associated 95% confidence intervals  will be determined. For categorical  efficacy 
endpoints the point estimate together with the 95% confidence interval will be 
calculated. Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].  
 All safety, PD and immunogenicity  analyses will be performed using the safety 
population of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_559522] actually received.  
 
All these data will be summarized using descriptive statistics as appropriate. 
 
PK/PD modelling will be performed to characterize the relationship between 
ALX-0061 exposure and the efficacy endpoints. The results of this exploratory 
analysis will be presented in a separate report.

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25/103 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
ALX-0061 has been developed by [CONTACT_14547] a new compound  neutraliz ing the  
pro-inflammatory activity of the interleukin -6 (IL-6) pathway. Based on its mode of 
action, ALX -0061 is currently in development for the treatment of autoimmune 
diseases such as RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) .  
 
The currently proposed clinical study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of different dose regimens of ALX -0061 administered subcutaneously (s.c.)  to 
subject s with active RA  despi[INVESTIGATOR_40921] (MTX) therapy, compared to placebo .  
 
1.1.  RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS  
 
RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects 0.5 -1% of 
the population and is 3-times more prevalent in women than in men [1]. It is 
clinically characterized by [CONTACT_163161], stiffness , and swelling due to synovial 
inflammation, leading to joint damage, deformity, severe disability , and increased 
mortality. Patients may develop multiple systemic symptoms including fever, fatigue, anemia, and osteoporosis.  
 
1.1.1.  TREATMEN T OF RHEUMATOID 
ARTHRITIS  
 
The goal of therapy is to reduce inflammation, inhibit joint damage, prevent loss of function, decrease pain , and improve function as well as quality of life . Initial 
treatment options include disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, analgesics, surgery, 
physiotherapy , and occupational therapy.  
 The synthetic DMARDs most commonly used include MTX, sulfasalazine, 
leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporin e A, and glucocorticoids. The 
therapeutic benefits of DMARDs in RA include control of signs and symptoms, improvement of functional status and of quality of life, and retardation of joint 
damage progression  [2]. MTX administered alone or in combination with another 
conventional DMARD, is the recommended first -line therapy for patients with RA  
[3].  
 For patients with an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs, biological drugs  
may be indicated. These biological drugs  block certain key molecules that are 
involved in the pathogenesis of the illness. The se targets include tumor necrosis 
factor alpha  (TNF α), selective T -cell costimulation molecule  (such as cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte -associated protein 4), cluster of differentiation 20 ( CD20 ), interleukin -1 Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26/103 (IL-1), IL-6, and interleukin -6 receptor ( IL-6R). The development of immune -
modulating agents has offered new treatment options for patients.  
 
Although anti -TNF α agents and other biological DMARDs have been established as 
effective treatment options for RA, there are reasons to study the effectiveness of 
new therapeutic agents. For example, there is a subset of the patient population 
that does not achieve a clinical response, defined as American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response, and only a small proportion achieve  a high level 
ACR response (ACR50 or ACR 70) [4]. In addition, biological DMARDs have 
limitations with respect to safety, dosing regimen, way of administration, and 
immunogenicity. Thus there is the potential for new therapeutic agents to address 
some of these limitations and to improve the effectiveness of biological agents in 
treating RA.  
 
1.1.2.  ROLE OF IL -6R IN 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF RHEUMATOID 
ARTHRITIS  
 IL-[ADDRESS_559526] partner, the adaptor molecule 
glycoprotein 130 ( gp130) , responsible for signal transduction and activation of the 
cell [5]. IL-6R is present not only as a membrane bound form but also as a soluble 
form. sIL- 6R can interact with IL -6 and this complex can activate gp130 -positive 
cells without the presence of membrane -bound (m)IL -6R on the surface of the 
cells. This process is called trans- signaling and im plies that mIL-6R negative cells 
are also susceptible to activation, with soluble IL -6R acting as  an agonist  [5, 6].  
 
As IL- 6 is a pleiotropic cytokine, its function is highly diverse. Many studies 
revealed that this molecule by [CONTACT_441224] -6R and gp130 plays a role  in 
the immune, hematopoietic, hepatic , and neur onal systems [7, 8]. 
 IL-6 plays also a critical role in different aspects of RA such as the transition from 
the acute phase of the inflammation to the chronic irreversible status [9], 
stimulation of B cells to produce auto -antibodies, cartilage destruction [10], or 
anemia [11]. 
 High concentrations of IL -[ADDRESS_559527] been documented in the serum of RA and juvenile 
RA patients  [12]. Several studies have shown that sIL -6R is also elevated in both 
RA and systemic onset juvenile RA patients  [13]. Analysis of the IL- 6 and sIL -6R 
concentrations in synovial fluid showed that the extent of joint destruction correlated with increased concentrations of both ligand and receptor  [12]. However, 
resident cells of the joint (chondrocytes, synoviocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells) 
do not express mIL -6R, indicating that high levels of sIL -6R are likely to be Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27/103 expressed by [CONTACT_441225]  [13]. This indicates that sIL- 6R is important in 
the chro nic inflammatory setting of RA.  
 
Based on the findings that the IL -[ADDRESS_559528] inhibi tors can improve 
manifestations of RA, supporting the concept that IL -6 signaling plays a key role in 
RA.  
 
1.2.  ALX-0061  
 
The following paragraphs provide summary information on ALX -0061; for more 
detailed background information, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure . 
 
1.2.1.  GENERAL PROPERTIES  
 
The active component in ALX -0061 solution for  injection  is a therapeutic protein, 
designated “ALX- 0061 Nanobody”. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins that are 
derived from the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain only antibodies, 
which occur naturally in the Camelidae  family. They have a high degree of 
homology (in terms of sequence and structure) to human immunoglobulin heavy 
chain variable region (VH) domains, and can be further engineered and expressed 
by [CONTACT_441226][INVESTIGATOR_349539] . 
 ALX-[ADDRESS_559529] s of 2 humanized and sequence -optimized variable 
domains derived from he avy chain -only llama antibodies: 
• One domain (designated 20A11) binds to human IL -6R.  
• The second domain (designated ALB11) binds to human serum albumin (HSA), 
as a means to improve the PK properties of the Nanobod y (half -life extension).  
 
ALX-0061 Nanobody inhibits the intera ction between the IL -6 ligand and the 
receptor subunit, thereby [CONTACT_441227] . ALX -0061 has a higher 
affinity for sIL -6R than for mIL -6R, and thus preferentially targets sIL -6R (the 
trans-signaling pathway). This target binding profile of ALX-0061 may result in a 
stronger engagement of the disease- driving target form (sIL -6R) [6] in a 
physiological situation with both forms (sIL -6R and mIL -6R) present . 
 
The second domain of ALX -[ADDRESS_559530] a bundant 
protein in plasma and has a half -life of approximately 19 days in humans [14]. 
Binding to albumin (as a carrier) has been shown to lead to retention of the bound 
protein in circulation, with a resident time approaching that of the c arrier 
molecule  [14].  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28/103 1.2.2.  MANUFACTURE  
 
The manufacture of ALX- 0061 Nanobody consists of an upstream process (i.e., 
fermentation of a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_441208]-[ADDRESS_559531] into the medium), and a downstream  process (essentially 
harvest, capture, intermediate purification, polish , and formulation of the 
Nanobod y). Additional information on the manufacture and pharmaceutical 
properties of ALX -0061 is included in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
1.2.3.  NONCLINICAL STUDIE S 
 
Pharmacology  
ALX-0061 was extensively characterized in vitro . The in vivo  efficacy and the PK/PD 
properties of ALX -0061 were examined in naive cynomolgus monkeys, in an acute 
cynomolgus monkey model of IL -6-induced inflammation, and in a collagen -induced 
arthritis model in rhesus monkey. PK was assessed during the toxicology studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys (toxicokinetics [TK]). Additionally, the impact of anti -drug 
antibodies (ADA) on the PK and PD of ALX -0061 was evaluated.  
 
Toxicology 
The toxicology program was carried out in cynomolgus monkeys, and consists of a 
single -dose intravenous ( i.v.) dose-range finding toxicity study, a Good Laboratory 
Practice  (GLP) -compliant 13 -week repeated -dose i.v. toxicity study , a 
GLP-compliant 4 -week repeated dose i.v./s.c. toxicity study , and  a 26-week 
repeated -dose i.v. toxicity study.  
 All relevant nonclinical studies conducted with ALX -0061 are described in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. The nonclinical data revealed no specific safety risks, 
based on the available safety pharmacology data, and local and systemic tolerability assessment.  
 
1.2.4.  EFFECTS IN HUMANS  
 
A combined Phase I/II study in subject s with moderately to severely active RA, on a 
stable background of MTX, has been completed (study ALX -0061- 1.1/10).  This 
placebo -controlled study  included 28 subjects in an initial single ascending dose 
(SAD) part where single i.v. doses of 0.3, 1, 3 , or 6 mg/kg were administered. In a 
subsequent multiple ascending dose (MAD) part, 37 subjects received multiple i.v. 
doses of 1 or 3  mg/kg every 4 weeks (q4w), or 6  mg/kg every 8 weeks, for 
24 weeks in total.  
 A Phase I study ( Study ALX0061- C102) assessing the bioavailability of single doses 
of ALX -0061, administered s.c. at 3 dose levels, using 2  corresponding single i.v. Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

[IP_ADDRESS].  STUDY ALX -0061- 1.1/10 IN 
SUBJECTS WITH MODERATELY TO 
SEVERELY  ACTIVE RHEUMATOID 
ARTHRITIS  
 
The results of the SAD and MAD parts of this study are discussed in detail in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, and are briefly summarized below.  
 
Efficacy in the MAD part  
In the MAD part of the study, all ALX -0061 treatment combinations showed rapid 
and long -lasting improvements in disease activity (as measured by [CONTACT_104706], EULAR, 
Disease Activity Score using 28  joint counts ( DAS28) [CRP], Clinical Disease 
Activity Index (CDAI ), and Boolean remission responses). There were high numbers 
of responders in all ALX -0061 treatment groups, with DAS28 remission observed in 
63% of ALX -0061- treated subjects at Week 24, and none of the ALX -0061- treated 
subjects showed worsening of disease activity during the study period. Ov erall, the 
efficacy profile obtained at Week  [ADDRESS_559532]-order (linear total body clearance [CL ]) and Michaelis -Menten elimination 
(nonlinear or concentration -dependent CL) describes well the PK behavior of the 
drug, and is consistent with the more than proportional  increase of exposure and 
half-life of the drug with the increase of the dose. Similar to monoclonal antibodies, 
the Nanobod y has a limited volume of distribution, corresponding to the plasma 
volume. As the PK of ALX -0061 is dose -dependent due to a different contribution of 
the non- linear clearance at different serum concentrations, also the terminal half -
life (t 1/2) is dose -dependent. At high concentrations, when non- linear clearance 
becomes negligible, the apparent t 1/2 estimated from the linear clearance  term only, 
is estimated at approximately 15 days.  
 
Pharmacodynamics  
• All ALX -0061 groups received biologically effective doses: rapid and long -lasting 
increases in IL- 6 and sIL -6R concentrations were observed across all ALX -0061 
dose groups . The PD results confirmed that sIL -6R (and IL -6) concentrations can 
be used as a biomarker for target engagement by [CONTACT_439957] -0061.  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30/103 • Dosing q4w at 3 mg/kg yielded the highest exposure, as indicated by [CONTACT_441228] (~ 10  µg/mL), strongest biomarker r esponse 
(based on sIL-6R profile), and the highest clinical remission rates.  
 
Safety  
• Single and repeated administration of ALX -0061 was well tolerated in all 
treatment groups, with a manageable and consistent safety profile for all 
ALX-0061 dose combinatio ns.  
• In the MAD part, the most commonly reported  AEs observed after intake of 
ALX-0061 included headache, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), arthralgia, back pain , and joint swelling. Most 
of the events were mild  or moderate and resolved during the treatment period.  
• There were no clear trends in the occurrence or type of treatment -related AEs 
when comparing the individual ALX -[ADDRESS_559533] that a maximum tolerated dose was reached.  
• [ADDRESS_559534]  (3 mg/kg ALX -0061) experienced an acute 
hypersensitivity during the first infusion of ALX -0061, which was stopped 
immediately . The subject  was successfully treated  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441209] -
histaminic drugs, prednisone , and salbutamol.   
- In the MAD part of the study, [ADDRESS_559535]  (3 mg/kg q4w ALX-0061) experienced 
an SAE of cerebrovascular accident  after having received [ADDRESS_559536] with a confi rmed Helicobacter pylori  gastritis and history of 
short NSAID intake experienced an SAE of hemorrhagic gastritis (not related) and a linked SAE of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (remotely related). 
Both SAEs resolved before the end of the study.  
• Four subject s reported treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) leading to withdrawal of 
study drug in the MAD part of the study : [ADDRESS_559537] with the SAE cerebrovascular 
accident  (described above ), [ADDRESS_559538]  with rash and non-immunoglobulin (Ig) E 
mediated hypersensitivity  reaction ( probably related to  the study drug ), 
[ADDRESS_559539]  with uncontrolled hypertension ( remotely related  to the study drug ), 
and [ADDRESS_559540] ( remotely  related  to the study drug ). 
• Regarding lab oratory  abnormalities, a  rapid and reversible decrease in 
neutrophils and platelets was seen in the majority of subject s after 
administration of ALX -0061. These decreases in neutrophil and platelet count 
seemed to be dose -related but did not reach clinically relevant levels. No AEs 
                                           
a The relationship between AEs and study medication was  to be  indicated as “none”, “remote”, 
“possible”, “probable” or “definite”.  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

parameters) were reported, except for [ADDRESS_559541]  with mild leukopenia (without 
neutropenia).  
• With the exception of individual subject s showing increases in liver parameters  
(mainly AST and/or ALT)  beyond the normal range, there were no clinically 
relevant trends in mean liver or other safety -related biochemistry parameters 
(including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) across dose levels.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  STUDY ALX0061- C102 IN HEALTHY 
VOLUNTEERS  
 
Overall, a single s.c. dose of ALX -0061 in the dose range of 50 to 300 mg was safe 
and well -tolerated in a group of 70 healthy male and female subjects . The s.c. 
bioavailability of ALX -0061 was 82.3% as estimated by [CONTACT_78013].  
 
There were no severe AEs, deaths, other SAEs or AEs that resulted in study drug 
discontinuation.  
 In the s.c. treatment groups, the majority of possibly related AEs were injection site 
reactions  (mainly pain and erythema), which appeared to be dose -dependent 
across the dose range tested (50  mg to 300 mg). All injection site reactions were 
transient and of mild intensity and apart from these reactions, no specific AEs were 
reported very frequently or showed a dose relationship. No differences were observed compared to the i.v. administration groups.  
 As expected from the mechanism of action, a  mild transient decrease in fibrinogen, 
neutrophils  and high sensitivity CRP levels was observed following administration of 
ALX-0061.  One subject in the [ADDRESS_559542] -dose up to a maximum of 150 U/L at 
[ADDRESS_559543] and no rise in 
bilirubin. The ALT level had returned to baseline at follow -up. 
 
The PK and PD results were used to determine the appropriate doses for the current 
Phase II study and are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
 
1.2.5.  BENEFITS AND RISK  ASSESSMENT  
 
Although a number of treatment options are available for RA, there remains a clear 
need for novel therapeutics. Many patients do not benefit optimally from the 
available small molecule and biologic drugs, leaving opportunity for differentiated 
drugs with n ew modes of action and an improved safety profile.  
 Considering the importance of IL -[ADDRESS_559544], and multiple clinical Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32/[ADDRESS_559545], as well as 
potential risks inherent t o the administration of therapeutic proteins,  are 
considered.  
 
• Inhibition of the IL -[ADDRESS_559546] has immunomodulatory effects, and has been 
reported to increase the risk for infection [15, 16]. So far, serious infections 
have not been reported for ALX -0061.  
 
• Suppression of IL -6 activity is known to reduce the levels of acute phase proteins 
such as CRP, SAA and fibrinogen [17, 18] .  
- Rapid and long -lasting decreases in CRP, ESR, fibrinogen and SAA were 
observed across all ALX -0061 dose groups in study ALX- 0061- 1.1/10. In 
general, these pharmacological effects were reversible and associated with 
clinical response in signs and symptoms of RA.  
- In study ALX0061 -C102, results indicate a trend towards a minor decrease in 
fibrinogen and (hs)CRP levels following administration of ALX -[ADDRESS_559547] 
subjects.  
 
• Suppression of IL-6 signaling has been shown to lead to decreases in neutrophil 
and platelet counts [19].  
- In study ALX -0061- 1.1/10, a rapid and reversible decrease in neut rophils and 
platelets was seen in the majority of subjects after administration of 
ALX-0061. No TEAEs related to the decreases in neutrophil and platelet count 
(or other hematology parameters) were reported, except for [ADDRESS_559548] with mild leukopenia (witho ut neutropenia; MAD part of the study).  
- In study ALX0061- C102, the results show a tendency towards a transient and 
mild decrease neutrophil count . Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

inhibition of the IL -[ADDRESS_559549] [20]. With the exception of individual subjects 
showing increases beyond the normal range, there were no clinically relevant 
trends in mean liver (ALT/AST /GGT/LDH/bilirubin) parameters, mean lipid 
concentrations, or other safety -related biochemistry parameters across dose 
levels in study ALX -0061- 1.1/10 or ALX0061- C102.  
 
• Recent data indicate that RA subjects have a generally increased rate of

observed following ALX -0061 administration.  
 
• As with all therapeutic proteins used in humans, infusion reactions (e.g., either 
anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) cannot be excluded.  
- In study ALX -0061- 1.1/10, two hypersensitivity reactions were reported (one 
serious and one moderate) . For additional details, please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure . 
- In study ALX0061- C102, no hypersensitivity reactions were reported.  
 
• Administration of any protein therapeutic can lead to the development  of ADA 
[22]. The currently available immunogenicity (ADA) results after i.v. and s.c. 
administration of ALX -0061 do not indicate meaningful risks related to pre -
existing or treatment -emergent antibodies to ALX -0061.  
 
In view of the early stage of development, it is not established whether  the above 
mentioned effects would constitute clinica lly meaningful risks for administration of 
ALX-0061; additional clinical studies  are needed for further evaluation. In general, 
the pharmacological effects reported during Study ALX -0061- 1.1/10 were reversible 
and associated with clinical response in signs and symptoms of RA. For additional 
and more detailed information regarding ALX -0061, the investigator is referred to

3.1.1.  STUDY OVERVIEW  
 
This multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled dose -range finding  
Phase  IIb study, is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALX -0061 
administered s.c. in combination with MTX, in subjects  with active RA despi[INVESTIGATOR_441211]. Approximately 330 subjects will be enrolled. An overview of the study 
design is included in Figure 1 .

MTX: methotrexate; OLE: open- label extension study ALX0061 -C203 ( in countries where study 
ALX0061 -C203 is approved, eligible subjects who complete the 24 -week assessment period of the 
current study will be invited to roll- over) . q2w: every 2 weeks, q4 w: every 4 weeks.  
 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive ALX -0061 and/or placebo s.c. 
injections at Week  0 and every 2 weeks  (q2w) thereafter, on top of their stable 
dose of MTX, up to and including Week 22.  
 
The dosing regimens have been determined based on : 
 
• Expected DAS28 response, ensuring characterization of the exposure -response 
curve (PK/PD mode lling approach).  
• Safety margins calculated by [CONTACT_441229] (cynomolgus monkey) versus the model -predicted human expos ure of 
the selected dosing regimens for the clinical studies . 
• Operational feasibility aspects for the study .

In vie w of the availability of effective RA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_441212], prolonged treatment with placebo or ineffective 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_441213] . Therefore, the proposed study includes  provisions 
for study drug discontinuation for non -responding subjects at Week 12, 16, or  20. 
Subjects  with < 20% improvement over baseline in both swollen joint count ( SJC) 
and tender joint count (TJC ) (66/68  counts)  will discontinue from the trial but 
remain blinded to study drug assignment. Any future care will then be provided 
(outside of the study) at the discretion of the physician  as part of usual clinical 
practice .   
  
Subjects will have visits at the site q2w up to and including  Week  24 (or early 
termination) . A F ollow-up Visit will be planned [ADDRESS_559553] any follow -up assessments.   
 The ACR20 response was chosen as the primary endpoint since this is a broadly 
accepted clinical response measure to demonstrate reduction in RA signs and 
symptoms  and sensitive enough to differentiate from placebo effects. For details on 
primary statistical analysis in this study , plea se refer to section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 Note that higher levels of response, as measured by [CONTACT_104706]50 and ACR70 response rates, and measures of remission using t he DAS28, CDAI, SDAI , as well as the 
Boolean remission definition, will be used as supportive evidence of efficacy. In addition, endpoints, including ACR responses  and disease activity  scores, will be 
documented over time, including earlier time points , before the therapeutic plateau 
is expected. This will allow evaluation of potential  differences in early clinical 
efficacy between the doses. Other RA domains, such as improvement in physical 
function and health- related quality of life, will be evaluated usi ng the HAQ -DI, 
FACIT -Fatigue scale and the SF -36 questionnaires.  
 
Safety and tolerability assessments will include evaluation of AEs (including serious 
adverse events, infections, injection site and hypersensitivity reactions ), laboratory 
assessment, urinalysis, vital signs, and physical examination.

dosing day. Each injection should be given at a different quadrant in the abdominal 
region. As injections  are to be performed q2w, all injection s can be performed in an 
abdominal quadrant of cho ice. However, note that the area of administration needs 
to be evaluable for local skin reaction (normal skin without skin burns, scars , or 
large tattoos in the area of administration). The abdominal regions  used for the 
administrations will be recorded in  the (e)CRF. All subjects will remain at the site  
for [ADDRESS_559588] times of study drug  dosing at the 
clinical site will be recorded in the (e)CRF. 
 
3.3.6.  PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T THERAPY  
 
Prior and concomitant medication are documented throughout the study.  
 Prior medications as per in- and exclusion criteria are detailed in section  3.2.   
 
During the screening and 24-week treatment and assessment period of the study, 
subjects are not allowed to initiate DMARDs  other than MTX for RA (see permitted 
and prohibited medication below).  
 Permitted Medication

The number of intra-articular  corticosteroid injections is limited to 2  injections over 
a 24-week period. Intra -articular injections may not be given from Week  8 until 
Week  12. The joint(s) affected by [CONTACT_164532](s) will be considered as swollen 
and tender for 28  days/[ADDRESS_559592].  
 
The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by [CONTACT_8668] -6. IL-6 blocking 
might therefore influence (normalize)  CYP450 expression  and products that are 
substrates for CYP450  enzymes (e.g. , statins, warfarin, theophylline, oral 
contraceptives, calcium  antagonists , phenytoin , cyclosporine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] ) 
could be metabolized faster . Subjects  taking medicinal products which are 
metabolized via CYP450 3A4, should be closely monitored and their treatment 
might have to  be adapted if necessary  in order to maintain therapeutic efficacy . 
Subjects  on warfarin will be monitored by [CONTACT_441241]  (See Schedule of 
Assessments); the lipid levels will be evaluated  which will be of help to monitor the 
subjects on statins (See Schedule of Assessments ). If needed, the Investigator  or 
the relevant treating physician should adapt the treatment of the concerned subject  
(unscheduled visits can be planned upon the discretion of the treating physician). Given the long half -life of ALX -0061, the influence on the hepatic enzymes can 
persist for several weeks.  
 Other medicat ion (e.g., to treat AEs) may only be prescribed after consultation with 
the Investigator, unless in case of an emergency situation that does not allow discussion.

criteria and are not randomized , will be designated a screen failure. Subjects who 
meet all eligibility criteria but discontinue from the study for other reasons (eg, 
subject request) will not be consi dered  screen failures.  
 
Data of all subjects screened will be collected in the (e)CRF in order to assess the 
numbers and characteristics of the excluded subjects, and the reasons for their 
exclusion. 
 
The results from the screening procedures needed to eva luate eligibility must be 
available prior to the first administration of the study drug.  Sites will use the central 
laboratory selected for the study to analy ze screening samples and to use these 
reported values to determine eligibility.   
 Unscheduled visits may be planned to assess, confirm, and follow up on clinically 
relevant AEs or laboratory abnormalities. Findings made during these unscheduled visits should be reported in the designated sections of the (e)CRF.

JOINT COUNT  
 
To be performed as part of efficacy measurements  (for more detail see 
section s [IP_ADDRESS]  to [IP_ADDRESS] ) at visits as indicated in the Sc hedule of Assessments. 
 All joints listed are used in the determination of the ACR response, where 68 joints 
are assessed for tenderness and 66 joints are assessed for swelling (see 
Appendix  9). The 28 joints indicated in the grey -shaded fields are used to 
determine the DAS28 , EULAR response, CDAI, SDAI, and Boolean  score.  
 
If tenderness or swelling is noted, enter a ”1” for that joint in the appropriate field. 
If tenderness or swelling is absent, enter a “0” for that joint in the appropriate field.  
 Joints that undergo intra-articular  corticosteroid injection will be considered as 
swollen and tender for 28  days/[ADDRESS_559607].  
 An independent joint assessor (and backup independent joint assessor) will be 
designated at each study center to perform all joint assessments during th e 
24-weeks assessment period of the study . This individual should have at least 
1 year of experience in performing joint assessments. The proposed assessors  
having less than 1 year of experience will need to be approved by [CONTACT_1034]. The 
independent join t assessor will perform only the joint assessment; this individual 
will not perform or assist in any other assessments in this study.  
 
The CRO  will provide training to an independent  assessor  from each site prior to the 
start of subject enrollment. In case the independent assessor cannot attend, the CRO will provide training to the Investigator who will then train the assessor. If 
possible, the  independent  assessor for the study should not be changed during the 
study. However, the independent  assessors from each site may train additional 
assessors at the site  for coverage during their absences. If more than [ADDRESS_559608] be listed in the ”Investigator

The DAS28 based on ESR is a statistically derived i ndex combining TJC (28 joints), 
SJC (28 joints), ESR, and VASPA [26]. It is a continuous parameter and is defined 
as specified in Figure 2  [27]: 
 
Figure 2: Calculation of DAS28 (ESR) score  
DAS28  (ESR )=�0.56×�𝑇𝑇𝑇28 �+�0.28×�𝑆𝑇𝑇28�+(0.70×Ln[ESR ])+(0.014 ×VASPA ) 
VASPA = GH  
  
As the results of ESR will be blinded to the investigative sites, the DAS28 will not be 
calculated on site but during the statistical analysis by [CONTACT_441246] -CRO. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  DAS28 SCORE  USING CRP  
 
CRP will be used in addition to ESR  in the calculation of DAS28, using the formula 
below. CRP is a more direct measure of inflammation than ESR, and it is more 
sensitive to short -term changes [28]. CRP is considered at least as valid as ESR to 
measure RA disease activity [29]. 
 
The DAS28 using CRP is a statistically derived index combining TJC (28 joints), SJC 
(28 joints), CRP  (mg/L), and VASPA. The DAS28 is a continuous parameter and is 
defined as specified in  Figure 3  [27]:  
 
Figure 3: Calculation of DAS28 (CRP) score

[IP_ADDRESS].  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
General information on evaluation and reporting of AEs is provided in section  3.5. 
 
All AEs occurring during the clinical investigation must be documented in the source 
documents and the (e)CRF . 
 Criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding (e.g., 
laboratory, vital signs), a complication of a protocol mandated procedure (e.g., blood draw, injection of study drug) or a change in physical examination findings 
should be reported as an AE are as follows, but not limited to: 
 
1. Result /finding  is associated  with accompanying clinical signs and symptoms, 
and/or  
2. Result/finding requires extra diagnostic testing (other than diagnostic exclusion tests) or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
3. Result /finding  would require  a change in study  drug dosing or discontin uation 
from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other 
therapy, and/or  
4. Result/finding leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of an SAE, 
and/or  
5. Result/finding is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_737] . Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

The Investigator will also need to indicate whether the AE is a serious infection.  
 
A “serious infection” is any infection t hat meets the criteria for an SAE : 
• require s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or  
• require s i.v. antibiotics and/or  
• result s in death . 
 
All serious infections should be reported as SAE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  LABORATORY ASSESSMEN TS 
 
Blood samples for routine and extended (including fasting serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) clinical 
laboratory analyses will be collected at time points  as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments.  
 
In general, blood samples will be collected via an indwelling i.v. catheter or by [CONTACT_37277]. Details on method, sampling and processing procedures will be 
provided in a separate Lab  Manual.  
 The following tests will be  included in the  routine clinical laboratory analysis : 
• Biochemistry: total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma -glutamyltransferase, 
AST, ALT, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, urea, total protein, albumin, 
glucose, inorganic phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride.  
• Hematology: leukocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes, partial automated differentiation  (lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, 
basophils, neutrophils ), mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.  
• Acute phase proteins: fibrinogen , CRP , and ESR . 
• Urinalysis: erythrocytes/blood, urobilinogen, ketones, glucose, protein, pH, and 
leukocytes.  
• Coagulation: activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and INR (the 
latter for subjects on warfarin only) . 
 
The following additional tests will be included in the extended clinical laboratory analysis:  
• Biochemistry: total cholesterol, HDL -cholesterol, LDL -cholesterol, and 
triglycerides (i.e., fasting serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]).

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71/[ADDRESS_559615] will be performed at 
time points as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments. Of note, a dditional 
pregnancy testing is allowe d according to local guidelines; however,  this additional 
pregnancy testing is not part of and cannot replace the protocol specific procedures.  
 At screening, seropositivity for hepatitis B, hepatitis C , anti -HIV1 and anti -HIV2 will 
be tested  and t he levels  of Rheumatoid Factor and anti -CCP antibodies will be 
determined . 
 In addition, an IGRA test to detect latent or active TB  and a chest radiograph 
(performed within 12 weeks prior to the screening visit or performed during the 
screening period) to detect evidence of malignancy, infection, or abnormal ities 
suggestive of TB will be performed  at screening and at any time during the study if 
TB is suspected . 
 All samples will be analyzed  by a central laboratory , except for ESR that will be 
measured via the local laboratory , by [CONTACT_441252].  
 
Except for ESR , CRP, and fibrinogen , laboratory values outside the normal range 
will be flagged and clinical relevance will be assessed by [CONTACT_737]. The 
results of CRP, ESR and fibrinogen tests will not be communicated to the investigational sites and CR O/Sponsor (unless in case of an alert for CRP or 
fibrinogen), with the exception of the CRP and fibrinogen results at screening which are needed for assessing the subject’s eligibility fo r randomization.  
If clinical signs and symptoms are present  for which the Investigator needs to know 
values of ESR, CRP, or fibrinogen  for medical care, he can request this information .  
 
All clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings will be recorded as AEs in the 
(e)CRF (also see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 In the event of unexplained or unexpected clinical laboratory test values, the 
test(s) will be repeated  and followed up until the results have returned to the 
normal range and/or an adequate explanation for the abnormality is found.  
 During the screening period, s ubjects with an abnormal clinical laborato ry value 
(i.e., biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis, fibrinogen, or coagulation) may have 
one laboratory analysis repeated if the I nvestigator considers the result to be 
inconsistent with prior determination and/or not representative of the subject’s 
clinical condition at screening. Only the clinical laboratory test not meeting entry 
criterion should be repeated (not the entire panel).  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

 In case any test is repeated , it should be performed as an unscheduled lab test and 
the last laboratory res ult should be used as the final screening value.  
 Repeat testing of the serology (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV) is not allowed. Repeat 
testing of the Quantiferon is only allowed if the result is indeterminate (see 
inclusion criterion 8). 
 Samples that remain after protocol -specific assessments have been performed may 
be used by [CONTACT_441249], PD, immunogenicity, 
metabolites, plasma protein binding, protein analysis, potency , and biochemistry. 
No human DNA or RNA analysis will be performed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  VITAL SIGNS  
 Vital signs parameters (assessed after 5 min in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) will be measured at 
the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments . These ob servations will 
be made using an automated device . All parameters will be recorded in the (e)CRF.  
 The following vital signs parameters will be assessed: height, weight, blood 
pressure, pulse, and temperature  (such as oral, axillar,  or tympanic). 
 
To obtain the actual body weight, subjects must be weighed lightly clothed. The 
height should be measured barefoot at the Screening Visit.

A complete physical examination will be performed at the time points indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments . Of note, additional physical examinations may be 
performed upon the discretion of the Investigator  (e.g., in case of AEs).  
 
Physical examination will be recorded as “normal”, “abnormal, not clinically 
significant” or “abnormal, clinically significant” at every assessment. A new finding or a change of a finding that is judged as an undesirable medical event (including 
all findings  recorded as “abnormal, clinically significant”) shall be reported as an AE.  
 
The physical examination will include at least:  
• Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat . 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133] . 
• Cardiovascular system . 
• Gastrointestinal system . 
• Musculoskeletal system . 
• Central and peripheral nervous system .

AND REPORTING  
 
3.5.1.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AE definitions wi ll be followed as stated in the  “Note for Guidance on clinical safety 
data management: definitions and standards for expedited reporting ” (International 
Conference on Harmonization [ ICH] topic E2A).  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An AE does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or 
non-investigational) product, whether or not considered related to that medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) product.  
 
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnosti c 
procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 
In the differentiati ng between medical history and AEs, the following points will be 
considered.  
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no 
symptoms or treatment are p resent up to the timing  of signing of the informed 
consent are recorded as medical history (e.g., seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or treatment are present after s igning of informed consent, but with  
unchanged severity , are recorded as medical history (e.g., allergic pollinosis).  
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as AEs.  
 
All AEs will be reported from the ti me a signed and dated ICF is obtained until 
completion of the subject’s last visit.  
 A TEAE is any AE temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether 
considered related to the study drug or not. TEAEs are recorded from the start of 
study drug administration, until completion of the subject’s last visit.  
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to collect all AEs (both serious and 
non-serious) derived by [CONTACT_19702], unsolicited reports of subjects, by [CONTACT_441254]: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

you last?”; “Is there anything new that you wish to discuss?”).  
 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_441256] (e)CRF page. 
AE entry should indicate time of onset and end time and rating of the seriousness 
(see section  3.5.2 ), severity (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and outcome (see 
section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) of the AEs, and relationship to study drug and study procedures 
(see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), action taken regarding study drug (see section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and 
concomitant therapy taken for the AE.  
 
The Investigator will judge upon the severity of the AEs and relation to study drug 
and study procedures.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  AE SEVERITY  
 
The severity of AEs will be rated on a 3-point scale according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE v4.0):  
 
• Mild: discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity (signified by 
[CONTACT_479] 1 of CTCAE v4.0) .  
• Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity (signified 
by [CONTACT_479] 2 of CTCAE v4.0) . 
• Severe: incapacitating with inability to wo rk or perform normal daily activity, 
(signified by [CONTACT_479] 3 or 4 or 5 of CTCAE v4.0).  
 
It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: a severe AE is not 
necessarily serious.  
 
Please refer to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) 
for assessment of severity of AEs related to  laboratory abnormalities.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  OUTCOME  
 
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
• Recovered / resolved . 
• Recovering / resolv ing. 
• Recovered / resolved with sequelae . 
• Not recovered / not resolved . 
• Fatal. 
• Unknown.

July 9, 2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 79/103 [IP_ADDRESS].  RELATION TO STUDY DR UG OR 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of 
treatment is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the 
completion of the (e)CRF.  
 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment in question. Possible answers are:  
• Unlikely/Not related . 
• Possibly re lated. 
• Related . 
• Not applicable.  
 If the causal relationship to the study drug is unknown, the answer is defined as 
“related ”. 
 Note that only AEs starting after administration of study drug can be assigned a 
causal relationship between the AE and study drug administration. For AEs starting 
prior to study drug administration, causal relationship between the AE and study 
drug should be not applicable.  
 
Assessment of causal relationship of any AE to protocol -required procedures can be 
completed with: 
• Yes (specify) . 
• No. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  ACTION TAKEN REGARDI NG STUDY 
DRUG   
 
Any action taken regarding study drug  due to an AE is to be documented using 
following categories:  
• Dose not changed . 
• Drug interrupted . 
• Drug withdrawn . 
• Not applicable . 
• Unknown.

following conditions:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening: the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event. It 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
an AE associated with a  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441216]:  
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours.  
- The admission is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged 
prior to the start of the study). 
- The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441217]).  
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39675] “medically important ” and as such may be reportable 
as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment. In addition, where l ocal regulatory 
authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct norm al life’s functions. 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is another medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_737], or is 
defined as requiring intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definition above (including suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a 
medicinal product should be reported as an SAE). Other examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not  result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Any AE is considered an SAE if it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by 
[CONTACT_95334] a significant clinical impact.  
 
All serious infections should be  reported as SAE.  
 A treatment -emergent SAE is any SAE temporally associated with the use of study 
drug, whether considered related to the study drug or not.  
 The Investigator or clinical site personnel should notify the CRO of all SAEs, 
regardless of rel ationship to the study drug, within 24  hours of clinical site 
personnel becoming aware of the event (see  Investigator Site File ).  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

Notification Form”, which must include the Investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship of the event to study drug, and must be signed by [CONTACT_737].  
 
The first report of an SAE may also be made by [CONTACT_756]. The Reporter must 
provide the minimal information: i.e., reporter identification, study number, year of 
birth, medication code number, period of intake, nature of the AE, and relation to 
study drug.  
 
This report o f an SAE by [CONTACT_6971] a written, more 
detailed report (the SAE Form) to be completed and signed by [CONTACT_737].  
 
Follow -up information, or new information regarding an ongoing SAE, must be 
provided promptly to the contacts  provided in  the Investigator Site File . 
 The SAE should also be recorded in the (e)CRF . Any medications necessary for the 
treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the concomitant medication section of the (e)CRF . 
 
SAEs that begin after the subject’s participation in the study is complete, but that 
the Investigator considers to be related to study drug, should be reported to the 
CRO/Sponsor at any time.  
 
3.5.3.  SUSPECTED UNEXPECTED  SERIOUS 
ADVERSE REACTIONS (S [LOCATION_003]R)  
 
Unexpected adverse reactions are adverse  reactions of which the nature  or severity 
is not consistent with the applicable product information (as described in the 
Reference Safety Information, provided in the Investigator’s Brochure).  
 The CRO will report expedited the following S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the IEC/IRB on behalf of the 
Sponsor:  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have arisen in the current clinical study that was assessed by [CONTACT_12137]/IRB.  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have arisen in other clinical studies of the same Sponsor and with 
the same study drug and that could have consequences for the safet y of the 
subjects involved in the current clinical study that was assessed by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.  
 
The CRO will report expedited all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the relevant CA on behalf of the 
Sponsor.

Investigator s all SAEs that are unlisted (unexpected) and associated with the use of 
the drug.  
 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are already present in the European Medicines Agency Eudravigilance 
database do not have to be once again reported to the CA because they have direct 
access to the Eudravigilance database.  
 
The expedited reporting will occur no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor 
(or the CRO on behalf of the Sponsor)  has first knowledge of the adverse reactions.  
 
For fatal or life -threatening cases the  term will be maximal 7 calendar days for a 
preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of the report.  
 
3.5.4.  REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AE reporting, including S[LOCATION_003]Rs, will be carried out in accordance with applicable 
local regulations. For reported  deaths, the Investigator should supply the Sponsor 
and the IEC/IRB with any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports 
and terminal medical reports).  
 
After termination of the clinical study (last subject last visit in the study), any 
unexpec ted safety issue that changes the risks benefit analysis and is likely to have 
an impact on the subjects who have participated in it, will be reported by [CONTACT_441257](ies) concerned together with proposed actio ns. 
 
3.5.5.  FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
AEs will be handled according to common clinical practice. If necessary, in order to 
obtain additional information to ensure safety to the subject, additional blood and urine samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator. Information 
relative to other means of investigational diagnostics used in relation to the AE will 
also be communicated.  
 
AEs are recorded from signing the ICF until completion of the subject’s last visit . 
TEAEs are recorded from the start of study drug administration, until the subject’s 
last visit .  
 
All AEs occurring at any time during the study (including the follow -up period) will 
be followed until satisfactory  outcome .  
 
For subjects that are considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be 
made to obtain informatio n on the final status of the subject.

• The proportion of subjects with EULAR response over time will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
• The change from baseline (absolute change) in disease activity over time will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The following disease activity scores will be 
used:

who maintained in remission at consecutive time points; i.e., at Weeks 12, 16, 20, 24 will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
The following disease remission definitions will be used:  
- DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6  
- SDAI ≤ 3.3

Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed according to the ITT 
principle. Summary statistics f or continuous efficacy endpoints  include mean  (and 
associated 95% confidence interval) , standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum. For categorical efficacy endpoints frequency and proportion  or 
percentage (together with 95% confidence interval) will be calculated . Analysis on 
the primary endpoint will be repeated for the PP population, as a sensitivity 
analysis . 
 
Subgroup analyses will be performed to evaluate consistency of the primary a nd 
secondary efficacy endpoints over covariates including demographics (including 
weight and region), baseline disease characteristics (including disease duration, RF 
category and anti -CCP category), baseline and prior medications, and site.  
 
Unless specified otherwise, non -responder imputation for missing binary efficacy 
endpoints will be applied, whereas missing continuous efficacy endpoints will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_441260].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  PRIMARY EFFICACY END POINT  
 
Under the assumption of monotonicity , a trend test will be performed as primary 
efficacy analysis. For small deviations from monotonicity (comprised in standard 
variation on ACR20 response rate), the power of the trend test remains sufficiently high. For the  descriptive statistic s (frequency, percentage) and  trend test  on the 
primary efficacy endpoint , data will be analyzed according to the ITT principle; 
thus, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were 
assigned. Subjects with missing ACR20 response at Week 12 will be treated as non -
responders (non -responder imputation approach).  
 Additionally , each dose group will be tested separately  against placebo using a Chi² 
or Fisher exact test (or other test if deemed more relevant). The study is only powered f or testing the trend of the primary endpoint. All other p -values are 
exploratory and no correction for multiple testing is foreseen.  
If ACR20 cannot be calculated at Week 12, such subjects will be conside red to not 
have achieved an ACR 20 response.  Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

Subjects who meet any of the following treatment failure criteria will be considered 
nonresponder for the primary endpoint analysis: 
• Initiate treatment with DMARDs (other than MTX), systemic 
immunosuppressives, and/or biologics for RA prior to Week 12.  
• Increase dose of MTX above the baseline dose for RA prior to Week  12. 
• Initiate treatment with oral corticosteroids for RA, increase the dose of oral 
corticosteroids for RA above the baseline dose, or receive i.v. or i.m. 
administration of corticosteroids for RA prior to Week 12.  
• Treatment with intra-articular  corticosteroids between Week 8 and Week 12.

summarized in tabular and/or graphical form.  Additional exploratory modelling 
(e.g., predictive analysis of specific biomarkers) may be performed.  
 
Exposure- response Model (s) 
An Exposure -Response analysis will be performed to determine the relationship 
between ALX -0061 serum exposure and PD and efficacy  endpoints i.e. , DAS28 and 
ACR20  using nonlinear mixed effects modelling.  
 
Details on the exposure -response modelling will be included in a separate Data 
Analysis Plan, and will be performed under the responsibility of Ablynx NV. Results of this analysis will be provided in a separate Modelling and Simulation report.  
 
3.6.7.  EVALUATION OF SAFETY  
PARAMETERS  
 
The DSMB will evaluate the safety data periodically (see section  3.4.5). 
 The following analyses will be performed  to assess the safety of subjects in this 
study . 
• The incidence and type of AEs.  
• The incidence and type of SAEs.  
• The incidence and type of related AE s (including study drug injection -site 
reactions  and hypersensitivity reactions ). 
• The laboratory parameters and change from baseline in these laboratory 
parameters.  
• The incidence of antibodies to ALX -0061.  
 
All safety, PD and immunogenicity  analyses will be performed using the Safety 
Population of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_559627] actually received.  
 In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed to eva luate consistency of safety 
over covariates including demographics (including weight), and concomitant 
medication (including immunosuppressants and corticosteroids).

For laboratory parameters, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be computed on the actual values and the 
change from baseline (abso lute) for each parameter. All laboratory values will be 
categorized according to their normal ranges as below, within or above normal. A shift table versus baseline (including final value versus baseline and worst value 
versus baseline)  will be created.  
 Vital signs  variables will be fully depi[INVESTIGATOR_441218] (for actual 
values and changes from baseline) and shift tables according to their normal ranges. Screening ECG values will be assessed through listing of individual results 
by [CONTACT_220248] t and summary tables.  
 Abnormal findings in physical examinations will be listed.  
 Immunogenicity will be assessed through listing of individual results by [CONTACT_441261].  
 
3.6.8.  DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
 
Simulations were performed to evaluate the power for detecting a significant trend 
effect in the different ALX -0061 doses versus placebo. Assuming ACR20 response 
rates of  25%, 30% , 45%, 55% , and 55% for p lacebo,  ALX-[ADDRESS_559628] s per arm will provide more than 90% 
power using the Cochran Armitage test for trend at significance level of 0.05 
(2-sided).  
 
Drop-out rate is assumed to be low (i.e. , between 5 and 15%) and considered 
equally distributed between subjects receiving placebo and ALX -0061. Subjects who 
drop-out are considered as non -responders  (non-responder imputation approach). Document ID: 25_A0006_14_0136          ADMS Version Number: 2.0          Printing Date: 17/Jul/2015

requirements are followed  and that subject’s human rights, safety, and well -being 
are protected . The monitor will record dates of monitoring in a study center visit log 
that will be kept at the site. At thes e visits, the monitor will perform source data 
verification and check the data entered into the (e)CRF for completeness and 
accuracy. The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the (e)CRF are known 
to the Sponsor and investigational staff and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_41067]. If electronic records are maintained at the investigational site, 
the method of verification must be discussed with the  investigational staff.  
 
Direct access to source documentation ([electronic] medical records) must be 
allowed at any time. Findings from this review of captured data will be discussed 
with the investigational staff. The Sponsor expects that, during on -site monitoring 
visits, the relevant investigational staff will be available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -
related documents. The monitor will meet with the Investigator on a regu lar basis 
during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course 
of these monitoring visits will be resolved.

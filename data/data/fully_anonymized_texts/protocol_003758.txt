of a Human Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB (VRC01.23LS), 
Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously to Healthy Adults.
Study 
Design:  This first-in-human, open-label study will evaluate VRC01.23LS (VRC-
HIVMAB0115-00-AB) in a dose-escalation design to examine safety, tolerability, 
dose, and pharmacokinetics (PK) in healthy adults. The primary hypothesis is that 
subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) administrations of VRC01.23LS will be 
safe and well-tolerated in healthy adults. A secondary hypothesis is that 
VRC01.23LS will be detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.
Study
Products:The VRC01.23LS broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (bnAb) targets the 
CD4 binding site in the HIV-1 envelope, is human in origin, and contains two 
amino acid modifications within the C-terminus of the heavy chain constant region 
designed to improve the antibody half-life in vivo. VRC01.23LS was developed 
by [CONTACT_33807]/NIAID/NIH and manufactured under cGMP regulations at the VRC 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_178096]

Page 13 of 681. INTRODUCTION 
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has 
remained a major global public health problem since the discovery of the virus in 1983. Reports 
by [CONTACT_100389]/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimate that since [ADDRESS_209146] been infected with HIV since the start of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], contributing to 36.3 
million deaths from AIDS-related illnesses[ 1]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_100368], global incidences of new 
HIV infections have actually declined from peak rates in the mid-1990s; a reduction attributed in 
part to increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the effective execution of 
prevention/treatment programs such as those that target mother-to-child transmission.   
Unfortunately, HIV infection is extremely complex and none of the current therapeutic or 
prophylactic regimens can completely prevent or cure an infection or induce a full recovery of 
the host immune system. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) is committed to the development of safe, effective methods 
to prevent and treat HIV infection and AIDS worldwide.  In this regard, the Vaccine Research 
Center (VRC), NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS), NIAID, are collaborating to evaluate the 
potential clinical uses of HIV-specific broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 
[2-4]. Thus, novel prevention and cure strategies are being investigated. 
In 2018, ibalizumab, which is a CD4-directed post attachment HIV-[ADDRESS_209147] 
licensed monoclonal antibody therapy indicated for heavily treatment-experienced adults with 
multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen [ 5].  The 
licensure of ibalizumab was the culmination of extensive studies over the previous two decades.  
Efforts to develop effective mAbs against HIV itself have resulted in scientific discoveries and 
innovations in the first twenty years of the 21st century that include sera screening strategies, 
pseudovirus neutralization assay development [ 6-8], and single B-cell isolation and screening 
techniques [ 2, 9-11], enabling identification and evaluation of mAbs against HIV-1 in clinical 
trials [ 12]; however, to date, an anti-HIV mAb effective for the prevention and/or treatment of 
HIV-[ADDRESS_209148] broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), VRC01, from a single B cell of an 
HIV-infected, long-term, slow progressor donor [ 2].  Since then, applying similar strategies to 
serum banks from HIV-infected subject cohorts, multiple researchers have identified and 
characterized diverse bnAbs [ 13-20] and, in many cases, have extended their investigations to 
clinical trials.  
Contemporaneous efforts and studies in anti-HIV mAb analysis, engineering, and functional and 
structural characterization have pi[INVESTIGATOR_178097], informed efforts to develop broad and potent mAb therapeutics, and 
provided clarity and insight into requisite elements of an HIV-[ADDRESS_209149] responses in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [ 15, 18, 21].
In parallel, the field of immunology has progressed in understanding of IgG subclasses, antibody 
domains, B cell ontogenies, and mAb-cell receptor interactions, including those with the 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which interacts with the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain [ 22-
24].  For biotherapeutic mAbs, strong pH-dependent FcRn binding capability is valued for its 
potentiation of longer mAb half-life and increased transcytosis across mucosal membranes.

Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.0 October 16, 2023
Page 14 of 68Rational design methods coupled with high-throughput protein screening identified a variant of 
bevacizumab, a mAb that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor, with a M428L/N434S (LS) 
substitution in the Fc domain that provided an 11-fold improvement in FcRn affinity at pH 6 and 
an extended serum half-life [ 25].  At the VRC, engineering this LS mutation into bnAb VRC01 
produced VRC01LS, which demonstrated sustained levels in mucosal tissue relative to parental 
VRC01 in a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection model [ 22] and in humans 
[26] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
1.1. Next Generation HIV Envelope CD4 Binding Site Antibody 
Development: VRC01.23LS 
At the VRC, advancing HIV mAb development efforts are typi[INVESTIGATOR_178098]-HIV mAbs to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) (VRC07-523LS, N6LS), the 
V2/V3 loop (CAP256V2LS), and the membrane proximal external region (10E8VLS) of the 
HIV-1 envelope protein.  
More recently, to advance the HIV antibody field, the VRC has undertaken systematic 
engineering of the “next-generation” anti-HIV envelope antibodies, by [CONTACT_106814] a structure-
based design and a matrix-based approach, with the aim to increase mAb breadth, potency, or 
both.  Beginning with previously well-characterized and clinically studied bnAbs, panels of 
sequence variations are systematically generated and tested.  Applying this approach to the CD4-
binding site targeting bnAb VRC01LS, VRC01.23LS has been identified as a lead candidate for 
clinical evaluation.  VRC01.23LS varies from parent VRC01LS by [CONTACT_178113]: 
Heavy chain (HC,), G54W (glycine to tryptophan at HC residue 54), filling a 
hydrophobic pocket at the interface between VRC01LS and HIV-1 envelope (env) gp120, 
Extended HC Framework 3 (FR3) loop, adopted from VRC01 mAb class member 
VRC03, that increases contact [CONTACT_178114]3 loop and a neighboring 
HIV-1 env gp120 protomer, and 
Deletion of the light chain (LC) N-terminal-most three amino acids to reduce potential 
steric clashes with the variable V5 region of HIV-1 env gp120. 
On a 208 HIV- pseudovirus cross-clade panel, in comparison to VRC01LS, VRC01.23LS 
exhibits overall ~8-fold greater neutralization potency with a geometric mean IC 50 of 0.042 
μg/mL, and 94% breadth at IC 50 of <1 μg/mL [ 27].  Serum concentrations of VRC01.23LS and 
VRC01LS in human FcRn knock-in mice were comparable [ 27].  Data from a study in 
cynomolgus macaques support the comparability of VRC01LS and VRC01.23LS PK.  
VRC01LS has a half-life (t1/2) of 71 ± 18 days in humans, and a comparable human t1/[ADDRESS_209150]-in-human trial with VRC01.23LS; there is no previous experience 
with this mAb product in humans.  Similar to its VRC mAb antecedents, VRC01.23LS targets

Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.[ADDRESS_209151], has 
been clinically evaluated in 15 trials, including Phase 1 studies VRC 601 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); VRC 
602 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]); and HVTN 104 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and Phase 2 studies HVTN 704/HPTN 
085([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and HVTN 703/HPTN 081 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
As of March 2019, VRC01 has been administered either IV or SC at doses up to 40 mg/kg to 
over [ADDRESS_209152] been no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to 
VRC01, as assessed by [CONTACT_1034].  
1.3.2. VRC01LS
VRC HIV-[ADDRESS_209153] been well-tolerated in adults and 
children; there have been no SAEs related to VRC01LS.  Clinical information regarding 
VRC01LS is available under DAIDS IND 125494 (VRC 606, HVTN 116), DAIDS IND 140909 
(Dual bnAb protocol), DAIDS IND 130804 (VRC 607), and in Gaudinski et al [ 26].  
In the three prevention studies (VRC 606, HVTN 116, and P1112), [ADDRESS_209154] received VRC01LS in doses ranging from 5 to 40 mg/kg IV and 5 
mg/kg SC in adults and up to 100 mg/dose SC in infants.  VRC 606, a VRC01LS phase I dose 
escalation study, has been completed and results published [ 26] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  HVTN 116, a 
phase I study to evaluate VRC01LS and VRC01 safety, tolerability, PK, and anti-viral activity in 
healthy adults has also been completed ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  A phase I study, IMPAACT P1112, 
evaluating the safety and PK of VRC01, VRC01LS, or another CD4bs mAb, VRC07-523LS, in 
HIV-[ADDRESS_209155] (IP) administration 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
In the two therapeutic studies in HIV-positive subjects (VRC 607 and Dual bnAb treatment in 
children), seven HIV-viremic adults and [ADDRESS_209156] received VRC01LS at 
doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/kg IV.  VRC 607/A5378, a phase I single dose study evaluating 
the safety and anti-viral effect of VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS in HIV-infected viremic adults, 
has been completed ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  VRC01LS continues to be studied in HIV-infected, virally 
suppressed children in a Phase1/2 study (Dual bnAb), administering VRC01LS and mAb 10-
1074 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.0 October 16, 2023
Page 16 of 68Collectively, safety data from these studies indicate that VRC01LS is safe and well tolerated at 
doses ranging from 5 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg.  The overall safety profile is consistent with expected 
events for monoclonal antibodies, most commonly mild to moderate reactogenicity that occurs 
shortly after product administration and is self-limited.  There have been no unexpected safety 
trends identified and no SAEs related to VRC01LS.  
1.4. Rationale for the Study Design
Animal and in vitro models of HIV infection have suggested bNAbs reactive to antigenically 
diversified Env proteins expressed by [CONTACT_178115]/or therapeutic agents to prevent the subversive effects of 
HIV on the immune system. Based on substantial PK data, acquired by [CONTACT_178116], next-generation VRC mAbs and confirming the effect on mAb half-life, 
the LS modification has been retained in VRC01.23LS to increase pH-dependent FcRn binding 
and hence to increase antibody half-life in vivo.  VRC01.23LS varies from parent VRC01LS by 
[CONTACT_178117] 1.1. VRC01.23LS aims to be a next-generation CD4bs 
antibody with increased potency and breadth relative to parental VRC01LS, while maintaining 
its extended half-life and safety.  In clinical trials, multiple VRC01-class antibodies, including 
VRC01, VRC01LS, VRC07-523LS, and N6LS, have demonstrated favorable safety proﬁles [ 16, 
20, 27-29].  
This study is the first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose, and PK of 
VRC01.23LS administered intravenously or subcutaneously.  The dosages selected for 
evaluation of VRC01.23LS are based on prior experience with other CD4-binding site mAbs, 
VRC01 and VRC01LS, which were shown in several clinical trials (VRC 601, VRC 602) to be 
safe and well-tolerated at 5-40 mg/kg dosages given intravenously and at a 5 mg/kg dosage given 
subcutaneously in both HIV-infected and -uninfected adult populations [ 28, 29] .  This study will 
involve the evaluation of VRC01.23LS administered alone or by [CONTACT_128174]. 
While Groups 1 through 4 will receive a single dose of VRC01.23LS by [CONTACT_178118], Groups 5 and 6 will receive three-repeat doses of VRC01.23LS at 12-week intervals 
(i.e., on Weeks 0, 12, and 24). A 12-week interval for repeat-dosing is based on predicted half-
life and has been used in clinical trials with VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS [ 30].  Aligning the 
antibody dose levels and administration interval with that used in prior studies of other HIV-[ADDRESS_209157] rather than assess the health of the subjects.  Laboratory assessments in this Phase 1 
study will include PK analysis, evaluation for anti-drug antibody (ADA) development following 
product exposure, and ex vivo analysis to assess the neutralization activity of VRC01.23LS post-
injection/infusion.  Other assays may also be completed from stored samples at a later date, if 
additional assessments are needed.

Page 17 of 68The VRC’s Vaccine Immunology Program (VIP), Gaithersburg, MD, will process blood and 
store coded samples, and will either perform sample testing or ship coded samples to designated 
research laboratories at the VRC or other approved collaborators.  Some immunogenicity assays 
may be performed by [CONTACT_100392], MD, or by [CONTACT_100393].  See Appendix I for schedules, volumes and tube types to be used for 
research sample collection.  Tube types for clinical laboratory evaluations and research 
collections are selected according to institutional requirements and are shown in the Schedule of 
Evaluations to estimate blood volumes.  Different tube types and sizes may be used to meet site 
requirements. Samples will be transported according to approved site procedures.
1.5.1. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis 
The VRC01.23LS concentration for the PK analysis will be measured by a Meso Scale 
Discovery (MSD) or similar assay [ 22].
1.5.2. Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Analysis 
A three-level algorithm will be used to screen, confirm, and functionally characterize ADA to 
VRC01.23LS in clinical serum and/or plasma samples. Analysis will be conducted according to 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance [ 31]. Screening and confirmation will 
involve a MSD electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bridging or similar assay [ 22]. The ADA assay 
will be conducted on batched samples collected at baseline, 4-weeks and 8-weeks in the single 
administration groups, with additional 28- and 32-weeks samples in multiple administration 
groups and may be tested at the last study visit if needed. It may also be assessed at other time-
points if there is a clinical indication, or the PK analysis shows a substantial decrease in the 
VRC01.23LS concentration. 
1.5.3. HIV Pseudovirus Neutralization  
For all study groups, subject sera will be evaluated to assess the functional capacity of passively 
administered VRC01.23LS to neutralize pseudotyped HIV viruses using an in vitro cell-based 
virus neutralization assay, such as previously described for VRC01, VRC01LS, and VRC07-
523LS [ 28-30, 32, 33]. 
1.5.4. Allotype-Specific Effects
Exploratory evaluation to detect theoretical immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) allotype-specific effects 
may be performed in cases when PK measures suggest a reduced VRC01.23LS antibody half-life 
or an ADA response [ 34-36]. Coded stored samples will be used for evaluation of the genetic 
sequence of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region allotype.

A summary of non-clinical studies conducted with VRC01.23LS is presented in the table below. 
More information related to non-clinical evaluations of VRC01.23LS can be found in the IB.
Table 1: Non-Clinical Studies Summary
Study Purpose Study Outcome
In Vitro Neutralization ActivityOn a 208 HIV-pseudovirus cross-clade panel, in 
comparison to VRC01, VRC01.23LS exhibits an overall 
~8-fold greater neutralization potency with a geometric 
mean IC 50 of 0.042 μg/mL, and 94% breadth at IC 50 of <1 
μg/mL.
VRC01.23LS Serum Levels in 
MiceIn human FcRn transgenic mice, VRC01.23LS exhibited a 
serum half-life (t 1/2) comparable to that of parental 
VRC01LS.
Non-human primate (NHP) PKThree cynomolgus monkeys received a single IV dose of 
10 mg/kg VRC01.23LS.  Two of the monkeys exhibited 
PK comparable to that of parental VRC01LS.  One 
monkey exhibited depletion beginning on day 20, 
suggesting induction of an ADA response.  No signs of 
toxicity were observed.
Tissue Cross Reactivity (TCR) 
StudyIn a GLP TCR study evaluating a panel of [ADDRESS_209159] 3 adult donors per 
tissue, VRC01.23LS did not exhibit specific cell 
membrane binding in any human tissue, which was 
expected and was consistent with similar lack of binding 
observed for VRC01 and VRC01LS. 
Autoreactivity by [CONTACT_178119] a human epi[INVESTIGATOR_178100] (HEp-2) by [CONTACT_178120]01.23LS demonstrated no evidence of autoreactivity 
as assessed by [CONTACT_178121]-2 cell binding.
Autoreactivity by [CONTACT_178122]-phospholipid reactivity VRC01.23LS was considered not reactive in the 
cardiolipin binding assay when compared to an anti-HIV 
neutralizing mAb (4E10), known to react with 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].

participants will continue to be followed for clinical safety and to collect the pregnancy outcome. 
Any follow-up procedures and/or data collected will be for clinical/safety outcome purposes 
only. Pregnancy will be reported as described in Section 5.6.
4.2.2. Participation of Children
Children are not eligible to participate in this clinical trial because the study agent has not been 
previously evaluated in adults.  If the product is assessed as safe for further study other protocols 
specifically designed for children may be conducted.
4.2.3. Participation of NIH Employees
NIH employees and members of their immediate families may participate in this protocol. We 
will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will give 
each employee a copy of the “NIH FAQs for NIH Staff Who are Considering Participation in 
NIH Research” published by [CONTACT_52610], Policy 404. 
For NIH employee subjects, consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_178126]’s team.  If an NIH staff member seeks to enroll in research taking place within their 
own work unit or conducted by [CONTACT_100404], the employee will be:
Informed that neither participation nor refusal to participate as a research subject will 
have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the subject’s employment, training or 
position at the NIH,

Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.0 October 16, 2023
Page 24 of 68When possible, consent should be obtained by [CONTACT_100405] a non-supervisory 
relationship with the subject, and
When consent is conducted, a third party (e.g. a consent monitor) will be included 
through the Bioethics Consultation Service or another party independent of the research 
team or, if a consent monitor is not available, the consent process will be observed by 
[CONTACT_178127]’s 
work unit and not a supervisor to the NIH staff member.  If no such person exists, 
consent observation may be performed by [CONTACT_178128].  
Protocol study staff will be trained on obtaining potentially sensitive and private 
information from co-workers or subordinates. 
4.2.4. Adult Subjects who Lack the Capacity to Consent
Adults who are unable to provide initial informed consent are not eligible to enroll. Also, adults 
who permanently lose the capacity to provide on-going consent after initial consent and during 
the study will be discontinued from protocol participation as it is described in Section 4.[ADDRESS_209167] will comply with the NIH CC Guidelines, which is 
available on the NIH intranet at the following link: 
http://cc-internal.cc.nih.gov/policies/PDF/M95-9.pdf.  In response to the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and changing information related to testing, all NIH CC 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_178101].
The study will be conducted at the Vaccine Evaluation Clinic (VEC) located at the NIH CC.  All 
nursing staff in the VEC are assessed annually for nursing competency including medication 
administration, peripheral vascular access device care and maintenance, and clinical emergency 
response. The VEC Clinic is equipped with basic cardiac life support equipment and emergency 
medications.  An advanced clinician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant or physician) is 
available in the clinic during administration of all investigational study products and throughout 
the post-administration monitoring period.
4.3.1. Recruitment and Retention Strategies 
Study enrollments will be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center.  Study subjects will be recruited 
through the VRC’s screening protocol, VRC 500 (NCT 01375530).  The on-site and off-site 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved advertising will be implemented.  
Per recruitment plan described in the VRC 500 protocol, efforts will be made to include women 
and minorities in proportions similar to that of the community from which they are recruited. The 
recruitment team utilizes a variety of mechanisms to recruit participants including flyer 
distribution within and outside of the NIH, social media, community tabling events, print and 
radio ads, listserv emails, posting information on the NIAID/ VRC website, and 
ResearchMatch.org to effectively recruit potential volunteers.

Page 25 of [IP_ADDRESS]. Costs
There are no costs to subjects for their participation in this trial.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Compensation
Subjects will be compensated for time and inconvenience in accordance with the standards for 
compensation of the NIH CC Clinical Research Volunteer Program.  Compensation for a study 
visit that includes IV product administration is $430; a study visit that includes SC product 
administration is $375. If enrollment occurs on a different day than study product administration, 
then visit compensation will be $85.  Compensation will be $200 for scheduled follow-up visits 
that include venipuncture, $85 for clinic visits that do not include venipuncture, and $[ADDRESS_209168].  The total amount of compensation 
varies depending upon the group and the visits completed. 
4.3.2. Screening 
All screening procedures for this study are described and will be completed through the Vaccine 
Research Center’s screening protocol, VRC 500 (NIH 11-I-0164) used for all VRC IND studies 
conducted at the NIH Clinical Center.  The Recruitment Plan per NIH Policy [ADDRESS_209169] (IRB)-approved advertising.  Screening evaluations 
performed to determine eligibility for study participation will include medical history review, 
physical exam, and the clinical laboratory tests as detailed in the Schedule of Evaluations, 
Appendix I). No screening procedures will be done under protocol VRC 615. 
Additional assessments of health may be conducted at screening based on clinical judgment.  
Screening evaluations for specific eligibility criteria must be completed within the time interval 
specified prior to enrollment for the given parameter and may be repeated, as needed, to confirm 
eligibility. 
Blood samples for research can be drawn at any time during the screening period and are not 
subject to a time interval. Informed consent documents will be reviewed.  Counseling related to 
potential risks of the study product, pregnancy prevention, and HIV risk-reduction will be 
performed.  An Assessment of Understanding (AoU) will be completed in association with 
enrollment into VRC 615.  Screening records will be maintained to document the reason why an 
individual was screened but not enrolled. 
Subjects who are not up to date on standard vaccinations may receive these, if available, during 
their participation in the screening protocol or at a later date during study participation as 
described in Sections 4.3.[ADDRESS_209170] administration(s) and sample collections before completing an enrollment to help 
ensure that the subject can comply with the projected schedule.  Informed consent must be 
obtained prior to enrollment.

to by a negative number of days (i.e., Day -1 to Day -42).  For calculating elapsed days following 
Day 0, each subsequent calendar date is labeled by [CONTACT_125557] “Study Day” as shown in 
the Schedule of Evaluations ( Appendix I).  Since there may be more than one research sampling 
timepoint of interest per study day, each sample collection timepoint has its own “Visit 
Number.”  For this reason, there may be more than one visit number recorded on the same 
calendar date.
Medical history and Day [ADDRESS_209172] administration, vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, 
heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), and weight will be recorded, a targeted physical examination may 
be conducted as needed, and women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy 
test.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. IV Administration
If a subject is assigned to an IV administration group, the IV access will be placed in an arm vein 
in an aseptic manner.  A different site may be used for collection of PK blood samples; however, 
the same site may be used after flushing the line if another site is not available.  VRC01.23LS  
will be administered with approximately [ADDRESS_209173] be 
flushed with about 30 mL (or appropriate volume) of normal saline under the same infusion rate 
to ensure the entire dose is given.
[IP_ADDRESS]. SC Administration 
If a subject is assigned to a SC administration group, the SC administration site(s) to be used 
must be assessed as acceptable by [CONTACT_52613]. The preferred SC administration 
site is the abdomen, but the upper arm or thigh may be used. Given the weight criterion in this 
study, the maximum volume needed to administer a 5 mg/kg SC dose is not expected to exceed 
5.[ADDRESS_209174] needle in a maximum volume of about 
2.5 mL per injection site. Up to three (3) SC injection sites may be used if deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_15370]. SC administration sites should be at least [ADDRESS_209175]: VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB)
Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.[ADDRESS_209176] will be given a 7-day diary (paper and electronic-based available), a thermometer, 
and a measuring tool. The subjects will use the diary to record their highest temperature, local 
and systemic symptoms, and concomitant medications taken for [ADDRESS_209177] training will be noted in the source documents. The 
web-based diary for this study is entered in the electronic database provided by [CONTACT_178129] a NIAID approved contractual agreement. No personal identifiable information 
(PII) is entered in this database. The secure web-based electronic method is preferred for diary 
completion, but subjects will have the option to use a paper diary. The paper diary, if used, will 
be transcribed into the study database and stored in the subject file for monitoring purposes.  
When neither paper nor electronic diary is available from the subject, the study clinician will 
document the source of reactogenicity information recorded in the study database.
The signs and symptoms solicited by [CONTACT_178130], feeling 
unusually tired/unwell, muscles aches (outside the injection site), headache, chills, nausea and 
joint pain; and local event at the product administration site of pain/tenderness, swelling, redness, 
bruising, and pruritus. Subjects will record their highest measured temperature daily for 
assessment of fever and largest measured diameter of redness, swelling, and bruising at the 
injection site, if applicable.  Subject diaries will be reviewed by a clinician for accuracy and 
completeness at follow-up visits.  Clinicians will follow and collect resolution information for 
any reactogenicity symptoms that are not resolved within [ADDRESS_209178] is reported. Events that 
may require a clinic visit include rash, urticaria, fever of 38.6˚C (Grade 2) or higher lasting 
greater than 24 hours, or significant impairment in the activities of daily living (ADL) (such as 
those consistent with Grade 2 or higher impairment). Additionally, other clinical concerns may 
prompt a study visit based on the judgment of a study clinician. 
Clinical laboratory assays and clinical evaluations will assess safety and tolerability at specified 
intervals after each administration.  Throughout the study, clinicians will also assess subjects for 
any changes in symptoms.  Any new or concerning symptoms will be fully assessed to include 
specialty consultation at the NIH Clinical Center as indicated clinically.

PK samples will be collected as close as reasonably possible to the target timepoints.  However, 
actual time of collection is critical for PK analysis and will be recorded for all samples.  The PK 
timepoints are shown in the Schedule of Evaluations ( Appendix I).
4.3.8. Follow-Up through End of Study
The Schedule of Evaluations ( Appendix I) provides details on the study schedule and the 
allowable windows for completing study visits.  Study follow-up will continue via clinical visits 
through [ADDRESS_209179] 
safety or for sample collection for immunological testing.  Any evaluation for an AE or possible 
exacerbation of a pre-existing condition may be evaluated at study team discretion as a “protocol 
related” evaluation.
After study completion, subjects may be invited to participate in one of the VRC sample 
collection protocols (VRC 200 or VRC 900) for follow-up sample collection.
4.3.9. Concomitant Medications 
Only routine prescription medications will be entered in the database at the time of enrollment.  
Subsequently, concomitant medications are only updated or recorded in the study database if 
there is an occurrence of an adverse event (AE) that requires expedited reporting, a change to 
pre-existing condition treatment, or the development of a new chronic condition that requires 
ongoing medical management.  Receipt of an FDA-approved vaccine at any time during the 
study will be recorded in the database.  Clinicians should work with subjects regarding the 
timing of licensed vaccines relative to study product administration as indicated in 4.3.4.  
Otherwise, concomitant medication changes throughout the study will be recorded in the 
subject’s chart as needed for general medical documentation but will not be recorded in the 
database.

Repeated failure to comply with protocol requirements.
Subjects who receive at least one dose of VRC01.23LS but are discontinued from further study 
product administrations will continue with follow-up as shown in the Schedule 5 of the Schedule 
of Evaluations with the exception that research sample collections will be discontinued for 
pregnant women or others in which it is contraindicated.    
4.7. Criteria for Pausing and Resuming the Study 
The study team will closely monitor and review study data as they become available to make 
determinations regarding the presence and severity of adverse events (AEs).  Study product 
administrations and new enrollments will be paused if any of the following criteria are met: 
One (or more) subject experiences a serious adverse event (SAE) that is assessed as 
related (possible, probably, or definitely) to the study product, or
Two (or more) subjects experience the same Grade 3 or higher AE that is assessed 
as related (possible, probably, or definitely) to study agent (other than self-limited 
Grade 3 AEs that resolve during the solicited reactogenicity period).
In the event of a pause, the IND Sponsor Medical Officer (MO) and the PSRT will be promptly 
notified. 
Plan for Review of Pauses and Resuming Rules:  
Study product administration and enrollments would resume only if review of the AEs that 
caused the pause results in a recommendation to permit further study product administrations and 
study enrollments.  The reviews to make this decision will occur as follows:
Pauses for related SAEs: The IND Sponsor Medical Officer (MO), with 
participation by [CONTACT_978], will conduct the review and make the decision to resume, 
amend or close the study. The IRB and FDA will be notified accordingly.
Pauses for Grade 3 or higher related AEs: The IND Sponsor MO, in consultation 
with the PI, will conduct the review and make the decision to resume, amend or close

5.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Solicited AEs (i.e., reactogenicity parameters as defined in 4.3.6) will be recorded 
without attribution assessments by [CONTACT_100408] [ADDRESS_209185] administration. 
Unsolicited AEs will be recorded in the study database with attribution assessments from 
product administration through the Day [ADDRESS_209186] administration visit. 
SAEs (as detailed in 5.2) and new chronic medical conditions will be recorded as AEs 
through the last expected study visit or contact.
Appendix II describes how the relationship between an AE and the study product will be 
assessed. Also available in Appendix II is the link to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity 
of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1 [July 2017], which will be used to 
determine the severity grades of AEs in this protocol with several modifications as noted.
5.2. Serious Adverse Events
The term “Serious Adverse Event” (SAE) is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows:  “An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator 
or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  Death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.”
Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction.  An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  “Life-threatening” refers to an AE that at occurrence 
represents an immediate risk of death to a subject. It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_178105] a SAE. 
5.3. Adverse Event Reporting to the IND Sponsor
AEs that meet SAE criteria must be reported and submitted by [CONTACT_100409], VRC/NIAID/NIH, according to Sponsor guidelines as follows: 
Product: VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB)
Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.0 October 16, 2023
Page 33 of 68Results in death
Is life threatening
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Requires unplanned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
In addition, any event, regardless of severity, which in the judgment of an investigator represents 
a SAE, may be reported on an expedited basis.
An investigator will communicate an initial SAE report within 24 hours of site awareness of 
occurrence to the IND Sponsor by [CONTACT_52621], which triggers an alert to the IND 
Sponsor MO.  Within 3 working days, a written summary by [CONTACT_52622].  
In order for the IND Sponsor to comply with regulations mandating sponsor notification of 
specified SAEs to the FDA within 7 and/or [ADDRESS_209187] submit 
additional information as soon as it is available.
5.4. IND Sponsor Reporting to the FDA
The IND Sponsor is responsible for making the determination of which SAEs are “serious and 
unexpected suspected adverse reactions” (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as defined in 21 CFR 312.32.
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.
Unexpected Adverse Event means an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs (as determined by [CONTACT_9533]) will be reported to the FDA as IND Safety 
Reports; IND Safety Reports will also be provided to the IRB.
The IND Sponsor will also submit an IND Annual Report of the progress of the investigation to 
the FDA as defined in [ADDRESS_209188]
The following information is consistent with NIH IRB Policy 801: Reporting Research Events. 
Reportable Event - An event that occurs during the course of human subject research that 
requires notification to the IRB.
For the purposes of this policy, reportable events include the following:
Unanticipated Problems (UPs) involving risks to subjects or others,
Product: VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB)
Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.0 October 16, 2023
Page 34 of 68Non-compliance (including major protocol deviations and noncompliance that is not 
related to a protocol deviation),
Deaths related or possibly related to research activities, and
New information that might affect the willingness of subjects to enroll or continue 
participation in the study.
5.5.1. Unanticipated Problem (UP) Definition
An unanticipated problem (UP) is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 
of the following criteria:
Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB- 
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied; and
Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and
Suggests that the research places subjects or others (which may include research staff, 
family members or other individuals not directly participating in the research) at a 
greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) 
related to the research than was previously known or expected.
A UP must be reported within 7 calendar days of an investigator becoming aware of the actual or 
suspected UP.
5.5.2. Non-Compliance Definition
Non-compliance is the failure of investigator(s) to follow the applicable laws, regulations, or 
institutional policies governing the protection of human subjects in research, or the requirements 
or determinations of the IRB, whether intentional or not.  
Non-compliance may be unintentional (e.g. due to lack of understanding, knowledge, or 
commitment), or intentional (e.g. due to deliberate choice to ignore or compromise the 
requirements of any applicable regulation, organizational policy, or determination of the IRB).
Non-compliance is further characterized as serious or continuing as follows: 
Serious non-compliance - Non-compliance, whether intentional or not, that results in 
harm or otherwise materially compromises the rights, welfare and/or safety of the 
subject. Non-compliance that materially affects the scientific integrity or validity of 
the research may be considered serious non-compliance, even if it does not result in 
direct harm to research subjects. 
 Continuing non-compliance– A pattern of recurring non-compliance that either has 
resulted, or, if continued, may result in harm to subjects or otherwise materially 
compromise the rights, welfare and/or safety of subjects, affect the scientific integrity 
Product: VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB)
Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.0 October 16, 2023
Page 35 of 68of the study or validity of the results.  The pattern may comprise repetition of the 
same non-compliant action(s), or different noncompliant events.  
Any actual or suspected non-compliance by [CONTACT_52624]/designee within [ADDRESS_209189] becoming aware.
5.5.3. Protocol Deviation Definition
A protocol deviation is defined as any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB-approved 
research protocol and is further characterized as major and minor as follows:
Major Deviations – Deviations from the IRB approved protocol that have, or may 
have the potential to, negatively impact, the rights, welfare or safety of the subject, or 
to substantially negatively impact the scientific integrity or validity of the study. 
Minor Deviations – Deviations that do not have the potential to negatively impact the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects or others, or the scientific integrity or validity of 
the study.  
For the reporting purposes, failure of subjects to comply with the research protocol does not 
represent non-compliance unless that failure is due to an action or omission of a member of the 
research team, for example, the failure to give adequate instruction to the subject.
A major deviation must be reported within [ADDRESS_209190] the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or 
the study’s ability to produce scientifically valid results.  A series of minor deviations pointing 
toward a more global issue that could affect the rights, safety or welfare of the participant or 
affect the validity of the study should be reported as a major deviation.  In all other instances, a 
summary of minor deviations should be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.
5.5.4. Death
Any death of a research subject that is possibly, probably or definitely related to the research 
must be reported within [ADDRESS_209191]: VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB)
Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.[ADDRESS_209192] be reported within 24 hours.
The following will be reported within 7 calendar days of investigator awareness: 
Actual or suspected UPs;
Actual or suspected non-compliance;
Actual or suspected Major PDs;
SAEs that are actual or suspected UPs;
New information that might affect the willingness of a subject to enroll or remain in 
the study;
Suspension or termination of research activities, including holds on new enrollment, placed upon 
the research by [CONTACT_4530], NIH or IC leadership, or any regulatory agency. 
5.5.8. Annual Reporting to the IRB
The following will be reported to the IRB in summary at the time of Continuing Review:
Summary of UPs and non-compliance;
AEs, including SAEs, that are not UPs, as a narrative summary statement indicating 
whether these events were within the expected range;
Minor PDs (aggregate summary);
Any trends or events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_52567].
5.6. Reporting of Pregnancy
Pregnancy is not an adverse event, but pregnancy, if it occurs during the time of study 
participation, will be recorded in the study database, and notification on the pregnancy will be 
distributed to the study team and to the IND Sponsor. Subjects will be followed for clinical 
safety and to collect the pregnancy outcome as described in Section 4.2.1. Congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria (Section 
Error! Reference source not found.) will be reported as SAEs. Pregnancy outcome will be 
reported to the IND Sponsor and to regulatory agencies.

6.1. Overview
This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study in healthy adults to assess the safety, 
tolerability, dose, and PK of VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB), a human monoclonal 
antibody with broad HIV-1 neutralizing activity. 
6.2. Accrual and Sample Size Considerations
Recruitment will target about 22 healthy adults, 18 to 60 years of age, with 3 subjects in each of 
the single dose groups (Groups 1 through 4) and 5 subjects in the repeat dose groups (Groups 5 
and 6) as shown in Table 2. The permitted accrual is [ADDRESS_209193] does not complete the minimum evaluations 
needed to meet the protocol criteria for the group dose safety or dose-escalation evaluation. Dose 
escalation rules are described in 4.4.
6.2.1. Group Assignments
The Advantage eClinical system (The Emmes Company LLC, Rockville, MD) will be used to 
assign subjects to a dose group in active accrual at the time of enrollment.  If an enrolled subject 
discontinues from the study before he/she has received study product, a new eligible subject may 
be enrolled into the same group.  If a replacement subject is needed in the case of a subject 
withdrawal, the replacement subject will be assigned to the same group as the dropout subject.
6.2.2.  Sample Size Considerations
The goal of the safety evaluation is to identify safety concerns associated with product 
administration. The ability of the study to detect SAEs can be expressed by [CONTACT_178131] 1 SAE would likely be observed and the true event rate below which no 
events would likely be observed. For this study, group sizes are targeted to be n=3 or n=5, and 
within this section, an event is defined as a subject experiencing at least one event.
For n=3, there is at least a 90% chance of observing at least [ADDRESS_209194] a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.035 or less. For n=5, 
there is at least a 90% chance of observing at least [ADDRESS_209195] a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.021 or less.

by [CONTACT_178132]. 
Adverse Events: All reportable AEs will be recorded and coded by [CONTACT_16252] (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). The 
number and percentage of subjects with each unsolicited AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_19313] 
(Groups 1 through 6). Subjects with multiple occurrences of the same event will be counted 
once; only the maximum severity level will be presented in severity summaries, and the strongest 
relationship level will be presented in relationship summaries. 
A by-subject listing of all unsolicited AEs will provide details including severity, relationship to 
treatment type, seriousness, new medical condition status, onset and end date, onset study day, 
duration, and outcome.
Local laboratory values: By-subject listings will present laboratory data measured during the 
course of the study and may include change from baseline values and reference ranges for 
abnormal findings. 
Additional listings may be included, such as disposition and administration status, concomitant 
medications, protocol deviations, or vital signs.

The tolerability of an investigational medicinal product represents the degree to which overt 
adverse effects can be tolerated by [CONTACT_423] [ 32]. Since VRC [ADDRESS_209200] cohort.
6.3.5. Pharmacokinetics Analysis
Blood samples for PK evaluations will be collected at time points based on participant study 
groups defined in the Schedule of Evaluations ( Appendix I).
Individual Subject Pharmacokinetic Analysis:
Population pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed on the VRC01.23LS pharmacokinetic 
data following product administration to determine compartmental PK parameters as previously 
described [ 37-39].  One, two and three compartment pharmacokinetic models will be considered. 
Based on prior pharmacokinetic studies of bnAbs, including VRC01LS, it is anticipated that a 
two-compartment model will adequately characterize the data.  The population analysis will 
generate estimates for initial and final volumes of distribution (Vd 1 and Vd 2), inter-
compartmental clearance (Q), CL and bioavailability (F).  Given the small subject numbers, the 
population PK analysis will include only a limited covariate analysis to assess clinical factors as 
fixed effects associated with VRC01.23LS PK parameters.  Specifically dose level, repeat dosing 
and allotype will be assessed as applicable. Final model selection will be based on changes in the 
objective function and graphically by [CONTACT_52631].  The final population model will be

6.3.6. Interim Analyses
Preliminary PK analyses may be done as the data for each dose level is obtained.  This may be 
performed before a dose group’s PK data is complete and may only generate a subset of the final 
PK parameters.  The interim analyses may be used to inform decisions about the dose levels to 
be administered in future studies. 
6.3.7. Missing Data
Missing data will be assumed to be missing completely at random. Analyses will include all 
samples available at each study time point. Based on experience from previous trials, we expect 
missing data to be rare. Regardless, in the event of missing data, we will report the occurrence 
and extent of missingness. We will also provide plausible explanations for the missingness 
mechanism, should such information be available.

8.2. Risk/Benefit Assessment 
8.2.1. Potential Risks
Risks of VRC01.23LS and mAb Administration
The side effects of mAbs are mild but may include reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, 
bruising, swelling), fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, shortness of 
breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema, diarrhea, 
tachycardia or chest pain. Clinical use of mAbs that are targeted to cytokines or antigens 
associated with human cells may be associated with an increased risk of infections [ 41]; 
however, this is not expected to be a risk for a mAb targeted to a viral antigen.
Administration of mAbs may cause immune reactions such as acute anaphylaxis, serum sickness, 
and the generation of antibodies. However, these reactions are rare and more often associated 
with mAb targeted to human proteins or with the use of murine monoclonal antibodies which 
would have a risk of human anti-mouse antibodies [ 41].  It is expected that that VRC01.23LS  
Product: VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB)
Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.[ADDRESS_209210] shown that infusion of a mAb may be associated with cytokine release, causing a reaction 
known as “cytokine release syndrome” (CRS) [ 42]. Most infusion-related events occur within 
the first 24 hours after beginning administration.  Severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, 
angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and hypoxia, are infrequent and more often associated 
with mAbs targeted to human proteins or when a non-human mAb, such as a murine mAb, is 
used [ 41].  Specifically, with regard to the rare CRS reactions, these generally occur within the 
first few hours of beginning the infusion and are more common with the first mAb infusion 
received.  This is because the cytokine release is associated with lysis of the cells targeted by [CONTACT_178134].  With 
licensed therapeutic mAbs, CRS is managed by [CONTACT_86964][INVESTIGATOR_51119], administration 
of histamine blockers, and restarting the infusion at a slower rate [ 43].
Delayed allergic reactions to other mAbs may include a serum sickness type of reaction, which is 
characterized by [CONTACT_22815], fever, lymph node enlargement, and joint pains.  These symptoms 
may not appear until several days after the exposure to the mAb and are noted to be more 
common with chimeric types of mAbs [ 41].
There are several FDA-licensed mAbs for which reactions related to the rate of IV infusion have 
been described.  Some symptoms may be treated by [CONTACT_125568][INVESTIGATOR_51119]. Supportive 
treatment may also be indicated for some signs and symptoms.  
Participation in this study may limit a subject’s eligibility for other future mAb studies.
Risks of Blood Drawing  
Blood drawing may cause pain and bruising and may, infrequently, cause a feeling of 
lightheadedness or fainting. Rarely, it may cause infection at the site where the blood is taken. In 
this study, an IV line that can be used for the collection of blood may be left in place for several 
hours on the days when there are frequent PK blood draws.  Problems from use of an IV for 
blood drawing are generally mild and may include pain, bruising, minor swelling or bleeding at 
the IV site and rarely, infection, vein irritation (called phlebitis), or blood clot. 
Risks of IV Infusions or SC Injections 
General risks of methods that use a needle include stinging, discomfort, pain, soreness, redness, 
bruising, swelling or a tiny cut at the needle insertion site.
Risks of New Diagnoses
It is possible that the standard medical tests performed as part of this research protocol will result 
in new diagnoses. Depending upon the medical findings and consequences of being provided 
with the new medical information about health status, the study subject may view this aspect of 
study participation as either a risk or a benefit. Any such information will be shared and 
discussed with the subject and, if requested by [CONTACT_423], will be forwarded to the subject’s 
primary health care provider for further workup and management.

Page 46 of 688.2.2 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits
The potential risks associated with participation of healthy volunteers in this study and receiving 
VRC01.23LS has been informed by [CONTACT_178135] a favorable safety profile, as described in 1.2 and in the IB. In addition, a protocol specific 
risk management plan with a risk register has been established for this trial and assesses potential 
risks and strategies to mitigate risk, such as gradual initial enrollment in each dose group with a 
dose escalation plan ( 4.4) and study pause ( 4.5) and product discontinuation criteria ( 4.6) to 
minimize risk to subjects.
There are no direct benefits to study subjects from study participation. However, the study may 
benefit others as there is a potential benefit from knowledge gained in this study that would 
further inform the clinical development of HIV mAbs for the prevention or treatment of HIV 
infection.

Page 67 of 68APPENDIX II: ASSESSMENT OF RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY PRODUCT AND TABLE 
FOR GRADING SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS
Product: VRC01.23LS (VRC-HIVMAB0115-00-AB)
Protocol VRC 615, Version 3.[ADDRESS_209253]: 
The relationship between an adverse event (AE) and the product will be assessed by [CONTACT_178140]. 
Definitely Related. The AE and administration of study product are related in time, and a 
direct association can be demonstrated. 
Probably Related. The AE and administration of study product are reasonably related in 
time, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_178141]. 
Possibly Related. The AE and administration of study product are reasonably related in 
time, but the AE can be explained equally well by [CONTACT_178142]. 
Not Related. There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
product. 
For purposes of preparing data reports in which AE attributions are limited to “Related” or “Not 
Related”, in this protocol, the “Definitely, Probably and Possibly” attributions will be mapped to 
the “Related” category. The definitions that apply when these two categories alone are used are 
as follows: 
Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study 
product. 
Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
product.
Table for Grading Severity of Adverse Events:
For consistency with other studies of VRC mAb products, the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, Division of AIDS. DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1. [July 2017]. Available from:
https://rsc.tech-res.com/docs/default-source/safety/division-of-aids-(daids)-table-for-grading-the-
severity-of-adult-and-pediatric-adverse-events-corrected-v-2-1.pdf 
The table will be used as posted at the link above with the following exemptions:
Weight loss will be recorded as an adverse event only if it is considered deleterious to 
the participant’s health.
For severity grading of the solicited bruising parameter at the product administration 
site, the definitions based on size of the largest diameter and listed for the “Injection 
Site Erythema or Redness” will be used. The severity grade definition for “Bruising” 
provided under the Dermatologic Clinical Conditions will be used only for 
unsolicited adverse events involving bruising at other body locations. 
Creatinine changes will be graded on the basis of the upper limit of normal provided 
by [CONTACT_52656].
Creatinine clearance changes will be graded according to mL/min provided by [CONTACT_178143].
Subclinical CMP results for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, and 
glucose will not be considered an AE unless grade 2 or greater.

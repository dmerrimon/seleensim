Clinical Study Protocol  Bimekizumab  DV0004  
   
Confidential  Page 11 of 49 1 SUMMARY  
DV0004 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, randomized, noncomparator, North America and 
Europe substudy to PA0012 in adult subjects with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) to evaluate the 
safe and effective use of 2 single -use disposable self -injecting device presentations for the 
subcutaneous (sc) administration of bimekizumab solution (the investigational medicinal product 
[IMP]). To provide patients with PsA with options for the self -administration of bimekizumab, 
DV0004 will evaluate [ADDRESS_1270619] (IMP) associated with a functional secondary packaging: the 1mL bimekizumab safety 
syringe (bimekizumab -SS-1mL) and the 1mL bimekizumab auto -injector 
(bimekizumab -AI-1mL).  
DV0004 is a substudy of PA0012, which is a multicenter, open -label, long -term safety study for 
subjects with PsA who complete 1 of the Phase  3 feeder studies (PA0010 or PA0011). The 
PA0012 study will evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekiz umab in 
subjects with PsA, and study personnel qualified in sc injection technique will administer 
bimekizumab to subjects (except for specified study visits at which subjects may self -administer) 
in a 1mL True North prefilled syringe (referred to througho ut this protocol as the 1mL PFS). 
Subjects will begin the DV0004 substudy and the PA0012 study at the same time. The DV0004 
substudy will include all PA0012 study assessments from Baseline to Week  4 (inclusive). 
However, subjects in the DV0004 substudy wil l self -administer bimekizumab at Baseline and at 
Week 4.  
During the 4 -week Treatment Period of DV0004, subjects will receive bimekizumab 160mg 
every 4 weeks (Q4W). This dose regimen will remain stable for the entire 4 -week Treatment 
Period of DV0004 (consi stent with PA0012). In the DV0004 substudy, subjects will be randomly 
assigned to 1 of the 2  self-injecting device presentations and will self -administer bimekizumab at 
Baseline and at Week  4. A safety follow -up (SFU) telephone call will occur [ADDRESS_1270620] 
self-administration in DV0004 (Week 5). After Week 5 in the DV0004 substudy, subjects will 
continue in PA0012 (the next visit after DV0004 completion will be the Week 8 Visit in 
PA0012). At Week  [ADDRESS_1270621]/caregiver/appropriate designee 
will perform administration under the supervision of the site staff after training . 
To compensate for subjects who have different study treatm ents between the feeder studies and 
DV0004, DV0004 is planned to enroll approximately 200 subjects (100 subjects per device 
presentation arm) to ensure that approximately 50 subjects per device presentation arm are 
evaluable for steady state trough pharmac okinetic (PK) level analyses. Within each device 
presentation arm, subjects will be divided into tertiles by [CONTACT_43658] (BMI); there will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_1270622] bimekizumab 
4 weeks after training in self -injection technique using the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL. The primary outcome variable is the percentage of subjects able to 
self-administer safe and effective injections using the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the 
bimekizu mab-AI-1mL at Week 4.

Clinical Study Protocol  Bimekizumab  DV0004  
   
Confidential  Page 13 of 49 2 INTRODUCTION  
Psoriatic arthritis is a common, chronic inflammatory disease cha racterized by a series of linked 
cellular changes in the skin. Bimekizumab (UCB4940; the IMP) is an engineered, humanized 
full length monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G1 subclass that selectively and potently 
inhibits the activity of interleukin (IL) -17A and IL -17F in vitro. Interleukin -17A and IL -17F are 
key proinflammatory cytokines believed to play important roles in autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases. Bimekizumab is being developed for the treatment of patients with 
inflammatory diseases such as PsA, psoriasis, and axial spondyloarthritis.  
It is important for patients who may use bimekizumab for the treatment of active PsA to have 
options for the self -injection of bimekizumab that fit their needs and preferences. Whilst some 
patients may prefer to  manually regulate various tasks comprising the self -injection process (eg, 
needle visibility of skin penetration by [CONTACT_79825], control speed of self -injection), others may prefer 
a more automated process (eg, do not wish to see the needle, desire an automati c injection). UCB 
therefore intends to provide patients with two different options to self -inject bimekizumab.  
The DV0004 study is a substudy of the PA0012 study. PA0012 will evaluate the long -term 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bimekizumab in subje cts with PsA; study personnel will 
administer bimekizumab in a 1mL PFS (except at specified study visits at which subjects may 
self-administer) . The DV0004 substudy will evaluate 2 self -injecting device presentations: the 
1mL bimekizumab -SS-1mL and the 1mL  bimekizumab -AI-1mL. Subjects will begin the 
DV0004 substudy and the PA0012 study at the same time. The DV0004 substudy will include all 
PA0012 study assessments from Baseline to Week  4 (inclusive). However, subjects in the 
DV0004 substudy will self -admini ster bimekizumab at Baseline and at Week 4.  
In the DV0004 substudy, the self -injecting device presentations are drug product (IMP) 
associated with a functional secondary packaging (either the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL). The bimekizumab -SS-1mL and the bimekizumab -AI-1mL are each 
single integral units which are intended exclusively for use in the given combination and are not 
reusable. Therefore, compliance to the EU Medical Device Regulation (except for Annex 1) and 
European C onformity marking (CE marking) is not foreseen. Full descriptions of the [ADDRESS_1270624] bimekizumab immedia tely after training in self -injection technique using 
the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the bimekizumab -AI-1mL.  
3.3 Other objectives  
Other objectives of the study are to evaluate the following:  
• Subject experience of self -injection as assessed by [CONTACT_905212] (VAS) for 
injection site pain and the Self -injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ)  
• Trough PK (trough bimekizumab) levels associated with self -injection using the test 
self-injecting device presentations, injection by [CONTACT_905213] 1mL PFS, injection 
site (abdomen or thigh), and BMI category (by [CONTACT_816756])  
• Immunogenicity of bimekizumab associated with self -injection using the self -injecting 
device presentations and injection by [CONTACT_905213] 1mL PFS  
• The structural and mechanica l integrity of the bimekizumab -SS-1mL and the 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL after completion of self -injection  
• The functional integrity of the bimekizumab -SS-1mL and the bimekizumab -AI-1mL after 
completion of self -injection  
• The overall safety and tolerability of self -injections using the self -injecting device 
presentations  
4 STUDY VARIABLES  
4.1 Outcome variables  
4.1.1  Primary outcome variable  
The primary outcome variable is the ability to self -administer safe and effective injections using 
the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the bimekizumab -AI-1mL at Week 4. Safe and effective 
self-injection will be evaluated by [CONTACT_905210]:  
• Complete dose delivery: Subject self -injects the complete dose of bimekizumab as confirmed 
by a visual inspection of the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the bimekizumab -AI-1mL which 
shows that the IMP is delivered completely (ie,  container is empty), and 
• No ADEs that would preclude continued use of the device presentations for self -injection 
(ie, no SADEs and/or ADEs leading to withdrawal from t he DV0004 substudy).  
4.1.2  Secondary outcome variable  
The secondary outcome variable is the ability to self -administer safe and effective injections 
using the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the bimekizumab -AI-1mL at Baseline (the first self -injection 
visit, immediately a fter training in self -injection technique). Safe and effective self -injection will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_905214] (see Section  4.1.1 ).

The other outcome variables are:  
• Responses to pre -injection SIAQ (versions 2.0 and 2.1) at Baseline  
Whenever SIAQ is assessed, version 2.0 of the SIAQ will be used  to assess 
bimekizumab -SS-1mL and version 2.1 of the SIAQ will be used to assess 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL (see Section  9.1). 
• Injection site pain (using a VAS; 100mm) by [CONTACT_905215] -injection using the assigned 
self-injecting device presentations at Baseline and Week  4 
• Responses to post -injection SIAQ (versions 2.0 and 2.1) by [CONTACT_905216] -injection 
using the assigned self -injecting device prese ntations at Baseline and Week 4  
• The structural and mechanical integrity of the bimekizumab -SS-1mL and the 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL after completion of self -injection using the assigned self -injecting 
device presentations  
• The functional integrity of the bimekizum ab-SS-1mL and the bimekizumab -AI-1mL after 
completion of self -injection using the assigned self -injecting device presentations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic variable  
The PK variable is trough PK (bimekizumab) levels associated with self -injection using the test 
self-injecting device presentations, injection by [CONTACT_905213] 1mL PFS, injection 
site (abdomen or thigh), and BMI category (by [CONTACT_816756]). Trough levels will be assessed at 
Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 (in PA0012).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunological variable  
The immunologi cal variable is the anti -bimekizumab antibody, which will be collected as 
described in the PA0012 protocol . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety variable  
The other safety variable is the occurrence of ADEs. Additional safety and tolerability variables 
will be collected as described in the PA0012 protocol.  
5 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 Study description  
DV0004 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, randomized, noncomparator, North America and 
Europe substudy to PA0012. PA0012 will evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of bimekizumab in adult subjects with PsA. In the DV0004 substudy, the safe and 
effective use of the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the bimekizumab -AI-1mL for the  sc self-injection 
of bimekizumab solution by [CONTACT_905217].  
Subjects from sites in the PA 0012 feeder studies, PA0010 and PA0011, will be eligible for the 
DV0004 substudy. The DV0004 substudy will maintain all study assessments of the main 
PA0012 study from Baseline to Week 4 (inclusive). However, only subjects in the DV0004 
PUBLIC COPY

application and any extensions or variations thereof. 
UCB   [ADDRESS_1270625] will be 
provided with training in self -injection and will receive the instructions for use (IFU) and any 
other applicable  training materials. S ubjects in the DV0004 substudy will perform self -injections 
at the DV0004 Baseline (corresponding to the Entry Visit of PA0012) with a subsequent 
self-injection at the DV0004 Week  4 Visit (corresponding to Week  4 of PA0012).  
During th e 4-week Treatment Period of DV0004, subjects will receive bimekizumab 160mg 
Q4W. This dose regimen will remain stable for the entire 4 -week Treatment Period of DV0004 
(consistent with PA0012). The DV0004 substudy will evaluate 2  self-injecting device 
presentations: the bimekizumab -SS-1mL and the bimekizumab -AI-1mL. Baseline for DV0004 
and the Entry Visit for PA0012 will occur at the same time, and the same interactive response 
technology (IRT) will be used for both studies.  
Eligible subjects will be random ly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to perform self -injection using either 
the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the bimekizumab -AI-1mL (see Section  7.10). Subjects will  
perform self -injection with the assigned device presentation at Baseline (corresponding to the 
Entry Visit of PA0012) and at Week  4 (corresponding to Week  4 of PA0012).  
At Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 (of PA0012), pre -injection blood samples for PK trough  
analysis will be collected. At Baseline and Week 4, subjects will self -inject 160mg bimekizumab 
using the assigned device presentation. Bimekizumab PK trough levels associated with injection 
by [CONTACT_905213] 1mL PFS (in PA0010 or PA0011) will be analyzed from the 
pre-injection PK sample collected at Baseline.  Bimekizumab PK trough levels associated with 
subject self -injection using the assigned self -injecting device presentation will be analyzed from 
the pre -injection PK samples collected at We ek 4 and Week 8 (of PA0012).  
In addition to self -injections, DV0004 substudy -specific assessments (eg, study personnel 
evaluation of safe and effective self -injection, VAS for injection site pain, SIAQ responses, and 
PK analyses; see Section  5.2) will be performed from Baseline through Week  4 (inclusive). An 
SFU telephone call will occur [ADDRESS_1270626] self -administration in DV0004.  
After Week 5  of the DV0004 substudy, subjects will continue in PA0012 (the next visit after 
DV0004 completion will be the Week 8 Visit in PA0012). At Week  [ADDRESS_1270627]/caregiver/appropriate designee will perform administration under the 
supervision of the site staff after training . Studies DV0004 and PA0012 will share a common 
database/electronic Case Report form  (eCRF) system (including common adver se event [AE] 
reporting) and a common IRT.  
Subjects who are withdrawn from DV0004 but continue their PA0012 study participation will be 
required to perform an SFU telephone call 1 week after their final DV0004 dosing visit (see 
Section  6.3). Subjects who are withdrawn from bimekizumab treatment (PA0012 study) during 
the course of DV0004 will also be required to follow the PA0012 withdrawal procedures.

Note: The DV0004 substudy ends after the Week [ADDRESS_1270632] bimekizumab. PA0012 is 
a multicenter, open -label, long -term study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
bimekizumab in subjects w ith PsA who complete 1  of the Phase  3 feeder studies (PA0010, 
PA0011).  
It is expected that most individuals who will use commercial bimekizumab for the treatment of 
PsA will self -inject bimekizumab and also that these individuals will prefer to have option s for 
the self -administration of their medication. DV0004 will therefore evaluate the safe and effective 
use of 2 different self -injecting device presentations: bimekizumab -SS-1mL and 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL. In addition, DV0004 will assess trough PK levels ass ociated with 
self-injection using the test self -injecting device presentation, injection by [CONTACT_905219] 1mL PFS, injection site (abdomen or thigh), by [CONTACT_14181] -bimekizumab antibody status, and BMI

6.2 Exclusion criteria  
Subjects are not permitted to enroll in DV0004 if any of the PA0012 study e xclusion criteria are 
met. 
6.3 Withdrawal criteria  
Since DV0004 is a substudy of PA0012, all DV0004 withdrawal criteria are captured in the 
PA0012 protocol. There are no additional DV0004 -specific withdrawal criteria beyond those that 
are described in PA0012. Subjects are free to withdraw from DV0004 at any time, without 
prejudice to their continued care. Subjects who withdraw from DV0004 but remain eligible for 
PA0012 (ie,  subjects who have a medical condition or personal preference that precludes further 
self-injection) may continue in PA0012. These subjects must perform an SFU telephone call 
[ADDRESS_1270634]. The term 
investigational self-injecting device presentation  refers to 2 different investigational 
self-injecting device presentation s (bimekizumab -SS-1mL and bimekizumab -AI-1mL) that are 
comprised of  drug product (IMP) associated with a functional secondary packaging . 
7.[ADDRESS_1270635] will be provided with self-injection training and the IFU for 
the appropriate device presentation.  
7.1.1  Bimekizumab -SS-1mL 
The bimekizumab -SS-1mL, shown in Figure  7-1, consists o f the naked PFS (primary packaging 
containing bimekizumab drug product for all Phase 3 studies) and a customized  
safety syringe for sc bimekizumab administration.  
The naked PFS is a glass, 1mL long, primary container with small round flange and a 27G 
half-inch staked needle containing 1mL of bimekizumab. The  safety syringe is a 
single -use platform device with a passive needle stick safety mechanism. To enhance the device 
usability, UCB has customized the external components including adding an 
over-cap and modifying the extended finger flange and plunger rod.

7.6 Drug and device presentation accountability  
The Investigator will receive numbered treatments that will be assigned to eligible subjects by [CONTACT_905221]. All IMP administrations will be observed b y the Investigator or his/her 
appropriately trained designee.  
Appropriate accountability forms that reflect the receipt and use of the IMP and the device 
presentations will be supplied to the investigational site. Details of any loss of the self -injection 
device presentations due to breakage or wastage, non -use, destruction at the study site, or return 
to the Sponsor or designee must also be recorded on these forms. All supplies and pharmacy 
documentation must be made available throughout the study for UCB (or designee) to review.  
The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for retaining all used, unused, and partially used 
IMP and device presentations until returned to UCB. Used or partially used devices are to be 
stored at room temperature in a secured a rea and may only be destroyed following UCB’s 
instruction. Devices with noted deficiencies (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) are to be returned to UCB 
immediately. The Investigator may assign some of the Investigator’s duties for drug 
accountability at the study site to an appropriate pharmacist/designee.  
The IMP and device presentations intended for the study cannot be used for any other purpose 
than th at described in this protocol.

During the Treatment Period of this study, IMP administration (self -administration) will be 
performed in the clinic and observed by [CONTACT_21438]/her designee; monitoring  subject 
compliance is therefore not applicable.  
7.8 Concomitant medications/treatments  
Any specifications given in PA0012 regarding permitted and prohibited concomitant medications 
must be followed.  
7.8.1  Permitted concomitant treatments (medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])  
Unless otherwise specified in PA0012, subjects are permitted to continue their prescribed 
medical therapy for the disease in accordance with the instructions of their treating physician. 
Concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including over -the-counter pr oducts and supplements, 
must be recorded in the subject’s notes (source documentation) and provided on the eCRF. This 
record should include the name [CONTACT_18467], the dose, the route and date(s) of administration, and 
the indication for use.  
7.8.2  Prohibited conc omitant treatments (medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])  
In addition to the prohibited treatments described in PA0012, subjects are not permitted to use 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_905206] [ADDRESS_1270638] kits of IMP. Further instructions will be provided in the IRT manual.  
The IRT will generate individual assignments for the self -injection device presenta tions. Eligible 
subjects will be assigned to the device presentations based on a predetermined production 
randomization and/or packaging schedule provided by [CONTACT_18338] (or designee). All eligible subjects 
will be randomly assigned to perform self -injection using  either the bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL at a 1:[ADDRESS_1270639] numbers and kit numbers will be tracked via the IRT.

A general overview of the study assessments is provided in Table  5‒1 and Table  5‒2. Of note, 
DV0004 and PA0012 will share a common database/eCRF system (including common AE 
reporting) and a common IRT.  
The following visit windows are permitted:  
• As in PA0012, a 7 -day visit window on either side of the sc heduled dosing is permitted; 
however, the Investigator should try to keep the subjects on the original dosing schedule.

UCB   [ADDRESS_1270640] be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  
• The SFU telephone call should occ ur within [ADDRESS_1270641] dose in the DV0004 
substudy, ±3 days.  
8.1 Treatment Period  
The DV0004 substudy will include all PA0012 study assessments from Baseline to Week  4 
(inclusive). All study procedures and assessments will be performed in accordance w ith 
Table  5‒1 and Table  5‒2. 
8.1.1  Unscheduled Visit  
At the Investigator’s discretion, an Unscheduled Visit may be completed at any time during the 
study but prior to the SFU Visit, if deemed necessary for the subject’s safet y and well -being.  
At this visit, any of the following assessments may be performed, depending on the reason for 
the visit:  
• Record concomitant medication  
• Record AEs  
• If medically indicated, other assessments that are performed in PA0012 may be performed  
9 ASSE SSMENT OF SELF -INJEC TION  
Evaluation of dose delivery and safe self -injection will be performed as described for the primary 
outcome variable ( Section  4.1.1 ). 
9.1 Assessment of injection site pain  
A VAS will be used to assess overall injection pain due to self -injection at Baseline and at 
Week  4. Subjects will be required to indicate their injection pain by [CONTACT_1299] a mark on a 100mm 
line from 0 (no pain) to  100 (worst possible pain). The subject will complete the VAS prior to 
completion of the post -injection SIAQ (refer to Section  9.1 for details).  
9.[ADDRESS_1270642]’s self -injection experience.  
The SIAQ was developed by [CONTACT_905222] -injection of an  sc medication (K eininger and Coteur, 2011). The pre -injection 
SIAQ is composed of 7 items grouped into 3  domains (feelings about injection, self -confidence, 
and satisfaction with the current mode of administration). The post -injection SIAQ is composed 
of 21  items grouped into 6  domains (feelings about injection, self -image, self -confidence, 
injection site reactions, ease of use, and satisfaction with self -injection). T he pre -injection SIAQ 
will be completed at Baseline and the post -injection SIAQ will be completed within 3 0 minutes 
after each self -injection (ie, at Baseline and Week 4).  
Version  2.[ADDRESS_1270643] -use structural, mechanical, and functional 
integrity of self -injecting device presentations  
Visual inspection of the used bimekizumab -SS-1mL and bimekizumab -AI-1mL devices will be 
performed by [CONTACT_905223] (ie,  clear evidence o f damage, such as cracks or loose parts, and not any 
superficial, cosmetic imperfections, such as scratches or smudges, which have no impact on 
structural or mechanical integrity). Any device with compromised structural or mechanical 
integrity will be retu rned to UCB for further evaluation. The bimekizumab -SS-1mL and 
bimekizumab -AI-1mL have a lockout feature, which is activated upon completion of the 
injection and which ensures the needle guard is in position permanently to prevent post -use 
needle stick inj uries. Devices determined to not have the lockout feature in place, as detailed in 
the IMP Handling Manual, will be packaged and returned to UCB for further evaluation.  
10 ASSESSMENT OF PHARMA COKINETIC AND 
IMMUNOLOGICAL VARIAB LES 
Blood samples for measurement  of trough bimekizumab PK and anti -bimekizumab antibodies 
(Section  4.1.3 ) will be collected at the time points specified in the schedule of study as sessments 
(Table  5‒1 and Table  5‒2). 
At dosing v isits, blood samples will be drawn prior to dosing (at the same time of the sampling 
for clinical laboratory tests in PA0012). The time and date of collection will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
Instructions pertaining to sample collection, processing, storage, labeling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_905207] (for PA0012). Detailed information on sample analysis will be 
provided in a bioanalytical report.

11.1 Adverse events (device presentations)  
All AEs (including serious adverse eve nts [SAEs]) will be reported in a common database for 
PA0012 and DV0004, but only ADEs, SADEs, and device deficiencies will be summarized in 
the DV0004 substudy. Specifically, only those AEs related to the use of the device presentations  
bimekizumab -SS-1mL or bimekizumab -AI-1mL (based on the Investigator’s judgement) will be 
assessed. All AEs (including SAEs) which are not assessed to be related to the device 
presentations  will be summarized separately in the report for the main study, PA0012; please 
refer to the PA0012 protocol for information on reporting and recording AEs (including SAEs).  
11.1.1  Definitions (device presentations)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse device effect (device presentations)  
An ADE is an AE related to the use of a device presentation. An ADE must meet 1  or more of 
the following criteria:  
• Adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the IFU, the deployment, the 
implantation, the installation, the operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical 
device.  
• Adverse event that is a result of a use error or intentional misuse of the device presentation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1270644]  
An unanticipated ADE is an ADE which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or outcome has not 
been previously identified.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious adverse device effects  
A SADE is an ADE that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of an SAE.  
An SAE (and therefore a SADE) must meet 1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
(Life -threatening does not include a reaction that might have caused d eath had it occurred in 
a more severe form.)  
• Significant or persistent disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect (including that occurring in a fetus)  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition of serious  
(Important medical events may include, but are not limited to, potential Hy’s Law, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring in tensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.)

(A patient admit ted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], even if he/she is released on the same day, meets the 
criteria for the initial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room visit that results in 
admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_905208]. 
However, emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_352178], instead, should be evaluated for 1 of the other criteria in the 
definition of serious [eg,  life-threatening adverse experience, im portant medical event].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58913] [eg,  preplanned 
surgery or elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened or manifested 
in an unusual or uncharacteristic manner] do not q ualify for reporting. For example, if a 
subject has a condition recorded on his/her medical history and later has a preplanned surgery 
for this condition, it is not appropriate to record the surgery or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18256], 
since there is no AE upon w hich to assess the serious criteria. Please note that, if the 
pre-existing condition has worsened or manifested in an unusual or uncharacteristic manner, 
this would then qualify as an AE and, if necessary, the seriousness of the event would need to 
be dete rmined.)  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Anticipated and unanticipated serious adverse device effects  
An anticipated SADE is a SADE which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or outcome has been 
identified in the risk analysis report (ISO [ZIP_CODE]).  
An unanticipated serious adverse device ef fect ([LOCATION_003]DE) is a SADE which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, severity, or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis 
report.  
The Sponsor will determine if a SADE qualifies as an [LOCATION_003]DE. The Sponsor will also evaluate 
all SADEs to ensure that expedited reporting requirements are met according to UCB Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and applicable country -specific regulatory requirements for the 
device presentation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Device deficiency (device presentations)  
A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use 
errors, and inadequate labeling.

All events of pregnancy or partner pregnancy will be followed and documented as described in 
the PA0012 protocol.  
11.3 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent  
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via medicinal 
products (device presentations or IMP) should be considered as an SAE or SADE; such cases 
must be reported immediately, recorded in the Adverse Event module of t he eCRF, and followed 
as any other SAE or SADE. Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg,  prion protein 
transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  
There is no evidence that there is a risk of transmission of an infectious agent with the device 
presentations.  
11.[ADDRESS_1270649]  
Excessive dosing (beyond that prescribed in the protocol and including overdose) should be 
recorded in the eCRF. Any SADE or  nonserious ADE associated with excessive dosing must be 
followed as any other SADE or nonserious ADE. These events are only considered ADEs or 
SADEs if there are associated clinical signs and symptoms or if the act of taking the excess 
medicine itself is an ADE or SADE (eg, suicide attempt).  
There is no evidence that there is a risk of overdose with the IMP when used with the device 
presentations.  
11.[ADDRESS_1270650], as early as pos sible, any 
safety concern(s) related to the IMP or the device presentation so that Investigators, clinical 
study subjects, regulatory authorities, and IRBs will be informed appropriately and as early as 
possible.  
The Study Physician (or medically qualified  designee/equivalent) will conduct an ongoing 
review of SADEs and will perform ongoing SADE reconciliations in collaboration with the PS 
representative. Serious AEs not related to a device will be reported in PA0012.  
As appropriate for the stage of develop ment and accumulated experience with the IMP and the 
device presentation, medically qualified personnel at UCB may identify additional safety 
measures (ie, vital signs) for which data will be periodically reviewed during the study.  
11.6 Other safety measurement s

14 STATISTICS  
A description of statistical methods follows and will be described in more detail in the Stati stical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
14.1 Definition of analysis sets  
Two different Safety Sets (SS) will be generated (1 for each device presentation): the 
bimekizumab -SS-1mL Safety Set (SS -s) and the bimekizumab -AI-1mL Safety Set (SS -a). Each 
SS will consist of all su bjects in the study who receive at least 1 dose of bimekizumab by [CONTACT_905229] -injecting device presentations. Safety variables will be analyzed using the SS -s and 
SS-a. 
Two different Full Analysis Sets (FASs) will be generated (1 for each device presentation): the 
bimekizumab -SS-1mL Full Analysis Set (FAS -s) and the bimekizumab -AI-1mL Full Analysis 
Set (FAS -a). Each FAS will consist of all subjects in the SS -s or SS -a who self -inject at least 
1 dose of bimekizumab using the given device and who ha ve an assessment of self -injection. All 
self-injection related endpoints will be analyzed using the FAS-s and FAS -a. 
Two different Pharmacokinetic Sets (PKS) will be generated (1 for each device presentation): the 
bimekizumab -SS-1mL PKS (PKS -s) and the bim ekizumab -AI-1mL PKS (PKS -a). Each PKS 
will consist of all subjects who receive the same bimekizumab administration (frequency and 
dose) in the PA0012 feeder studies as in the DV0004 substudy and who have at least 1  evaluable 
PK assessment in the DV0004 sub study. Pharmacokinetic variables will be analyzed using the 
PKS-s and PKS -a.

Confidential  Page 40 of 49 14.2 General statistical considerations  
This is an estimation study design with no formal statistical hypothesis testing. The study will 
estimate the true population proportion and/or mean of self -injection related endpoints for each 
device presentation separately. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include: number 
of available observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For 
categorical variables,  the number and proportion of subjects, along with the 90% confidence 
interval  (CI) based on the Exact Binomial method, will be presented.  
The Baseline value is defined as the last nonmissing measurement prior to the first self -injection 
at Visit 1 (Baseli ne). No imputation of missing data will be performed. All data recorded in the 
eCRF and questionnaires will be listed.  
14.3 Planned analyses of outcome variables  
All statistical analyses will be descriptive in nature. No inferential statistical analyses are 
planned.  
14.3.1  Analysis of the primary outcome variable  
The primary outcome variable is the percentage of all subjects able to self -administer safe and 
effective injections using the given device presentation at Week  4. Safe and effective 
self-injection will be eva luated by [CONTACT_905230]  4.1.1 . 
The number and percentage of subjects with safe and effective self -injections will be tabulated 
separately for each device presentation overall using the relevant FAS population (FAS -s or 
FAS-a). The 90% CIs based on the Exact Binomial method will be reported as well.  
14.3.2  Analysis of the secondary outcome variable  
The secondary outcome variable  is the percentage of subjects able to self -administer safe and 
effective injections using the given device presentation at Baseline (the first self -injection visit, 
immediately after training in self -injection technique). Safe and effective self -injection  will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_905231]  4.1.1 . 
The secondary outcome variables will be analyzed in the same manner as the pri mary outcome 
variable (see Section  14.3.1 ). 
14.3.3  Analysis of other outcome variables  
The other outcome variables are defined in Section  4.1.3 . These variables will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics and they will be tabulated separately for each device overall using the 
relevant FAS population (FAS -s or FAS -a). 
14.4 Planned pharmacokinetic analyses  
The statistical analyses of the PK data will be descriptive in nature and will be summarized using 
the relevant device presentation -specific population (PKS -s or PKS -a). Data will be analyzed 
overall for e ach device presentation by [CONTACT_905232] (self -administered or study 
personnel -administered), by [CONTACT_93403] (abdomen or thigh), by [CONTACT_14181] -bimekizumab antibody 
status, and by [CONTACT_150146]. Three BMI categories will be defined based on tertiles derived 
from subjects’ Baseline BMI values.

blood samples will be taken before self -injection at the Baseline Visit (PK trough and 
anti-bimekizumab antibody analysis), Visit 2 Week 4 (PK trough analysis only), and Week 8 of 
PA0012 (PK trough and anti -bimekizumab antibody analysis). Anti -bimekizumab antibody 
status at or prior to the PK sampling (at Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8) will be used. The 
number and percentage of anti -bimekizumab antibody -positive and -negative subjects before 
self-injection (Baseline) and after self -injection (Week 8 of PA0012) will be summarized.  
Bimekizumab PK trough levels associated with injection by [CONTACT_905213] 1mL PFS 
(in PA0010 or PA0 011) will be analyzed from the pre -injection PK sample collected at Baseline. 
Bimekizumab PK trough levels associated with subject self -injection using the assigned self -
injecting device presentation will be analyzed from the pre -injection PK samples colle cted at 
Week 4 and Week 8 (of PA0012).  
For the analysis of PK trough levels by [CONTACT_93403] (abdomen or thigh) and by [CONTACT_150146] 
(by [CONTACT_816756]), only self -administration PK trough levels will be used.  
14.5 Planned safety analyses  
The safety variable is the oc currence of ADEs; additional safety and tolerability variables will be 
collected in PA0012 (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Analyses of safety data will be don e separately for 
each device presentation overall and within each device presentation using the relevant SS 
population (SS -s or SS -a). 
All ADE data will be listed and no statistical testing will be performed. Only treatment -emergent 
ADEs will be included in the summary tables. All ADEs will be coded and classified by [CONTACT_29974], high level term, and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities v19.[ADDRESS_1270660] to any endpoint, and sample size is based on 
practical considerations. In order to maintain blinding in the PA0012 feeder studies (PA0010 and 
PA0011), DV0004 will recruit al l subjects who complete the PA0010 and PA0011 feeder studies 
(including those treated with a comparator or placebo in the feeder study) up to a total of about 
200 subjects. A total of 100  subjects (50  subjects per device presentation arm) are planned for 
PK trough level analyses, but these analyses will only be performed on subjects who were treated 
with bimekizumab 160mg Q4W (ie, not with placebo or comparator) in the feeder studies prior 
to rolling over into the DV0004 substudy. The DV0004 substudy will e nroll approximately 
200 subjects (to compensate for subjects treated with placebo or comparator) to ensure that 
100 subjects with stable (160mg Q4W bimekizumab) PK trough levels are available for PK 
trough analysis.  
Subjects who enroll in the DV0004 substu dy will be randomly assigned to the 
bimekizumab -SS-1mL or the bimekizumab -AI-1mL device presentation  arms (each device 
presentation arm will consist of approximately 100 subjects). Within each device presentation 
arm, subjects will be divided into tertiles  by [CONTACT_44207]; there will be approximately [ADDRESS_1270661]’s informed consent must be obtained and documented in accordance with local

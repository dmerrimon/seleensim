Study 19678A – Clinical Study Protocol Page 11 of 109∀Intercurrent events:  The IEs are defined above.  Use of acute rescue medication or preventive migraine 
therapy (different from investigational medication) is taken into account using a composite strategy.  Incorrect administration of treatment is handled using a treatment policy strategy.  The IE “use of preventive migraine therapy” will be addressed with a hypothetical strategy. If withdrawal from study occurred, data obtained after withdrawal will be included in the analysis, and, if IEs occur after withdrawal from study (use of acute rescue medication or preventive migraine therapy), the methods described for handling IEs will be applied. Full details of the statistical methods for handling IEs and missing data, will be described in the SAP.
∀Population level summary (primary analysis):  The least-
squares mean difference in change from baseline in 
the number of MMDs (Weeks 1 to 4)  between the high dose of  and placebo, based on an analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline MMDs as covariate and treatment (placebo, low dose, high dose), population (EM or CM), and an interaction between the stratification factors (region and  
!Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint:
∀The impact of the imputation of the primary endpoint will be assessed in a sensitivity analysis, applying 
different measures of imputation.  For patients experiencing an IE, the imputation strategy will depend on the type of IE.
∀The primary analysis model will be applied, including an adjustment for whether or not a patient had a 
COVID-19 vaccination during the 4 weeks following IMP administration.
Testing Strategy
The type 1 error will only be controlled for the primary analysis comparing the primary endpoint (change from baseline in MMDs [Weeks 1 to 4]) for the high dose of Lu AG09222 to placebo at a one-sided 5% significance
level.  Other analyses will be considered exploratory, and statistical significance will be considered indicative, 
rather than confirmative, for the finding.
Sample Size Considerations
Simulations were used to determine a sample size that ensured at least 80% power at a one-sided 5% 
significance level for detecting an effect of 2.1 on the  dose when using an ANCOVA with baseline 
MMD as a covariate and treatment and population (EM or CM) as fixed factors.  A population with 30% EM 
and 70% CM patients was assumed with standard deviations of 3.[ADDRESS_769881] deviation of 5.6 for the full population.  The resulting required sample size is 86 patients per arm for the  dose and placebo.  No formal power calculation was performed for the dose.  A sample size of 43 patient
s per arm was considered sufficient to evaluate the relevant endpoints for this dose, which results in 
a randomization ratio of 2:1:2.  Adjusting for an expected 5% dropout rate, a total sample size of 230 will be required.
The cap of 30% for the EM population results in a similar precision (standard error) for the treatment estimates 
for the EM and CM populations.
Simulations are based on [ZIP_CODE] runs.CCI CCICCI

prevalent neurological diseases for which medical treatment is sought and worldwide is 
considered the leading cause of disability for people under the age of 50.3,4
Generally, migraine begins as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_585485].  Between attacks of migrain e, the nervous 
system returns to a normal (premorbid) state of function.  However, among patient swith 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM), approximately 2.5% per year progress to chronic migraine (CM), 
that is, headache on [ADDRESS_769889] and disability aremuch greater than th oseobserved in EM.  In addition, CM has a 
stronger association with co -morbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, and non -headache 
pain.
Currently ,pharmacological treatments of migraine include acute and preventive treatments. 
Preventive treatments are used on a sustained basis for periods of months to years to prevent 
migraine from occurring. Preventive treatment may be appropriate in a number of instances, 
including where frequency of attacks per month is 2 or higher or where a patient’s quality of 
life is severely impaired.7  Conventional preventive treatments belong to different 
pharmacological categories (e.g., beta -blockers, anticonvulsants) and were all initially 
developed for other conditions.  These treatments show little efficacy and often poor 
tolerability in patients with migraine, resulting in frequent early discontinuation of 
treatment.2,8,9,10,11,12,13Furthermore, preventive treatment can take weeks to months to achieve 
optimal efficacy.14,[ADDRESS_769890] as early as possible is a particularly 
important outcome for patients and is important forfacilitating management and health 
resource decisions by [CONTACT_129000].  This is highlighted in the recently published 
guidelines of the International Headache Society (IHS) for controlled studies of preventive 
treatment of EM and CM in adults where the onset of preventive treatment effect is 
recommended as a secondary endpoint.17,18
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159737] -activating polypeptide ( PACAP )is a multifunctional neuropeptide 
that isimplicated in migraine pathophysiology.19,20,21,22,23PACAP is expressed, along with its 
receptors, throughout the nervous system, including distinct are as suggestive of a role in

Study 19678A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 29of 109migraine pathophysiology such as the trigeminovascular system, trigeminal ganglia, 
trigeminal nucleus caudalis, dorsal horn of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brainstem, hypothalamus, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and the otic and sphenopalatine ganglions (SPGs) .24,25,26,27,28,29PACAP exists in 
twoforms, one composed of 38 amino acids (PACAP38) and another composed of 27 amino 
acids (PACAP27). Of the two forms, PACAP38 is the more prevalent, representing up to 90% 
of PACAP forms in mammalian tissues.20
A mechanistic role for PACAP38 in migraine is supported by [CONTACT_585495]: 
(1) an infusion of PACAP38 in patients with migraine wit hout aura triggers migraine -like 
attacks (associated with photophobia, phonophobia ,and nausea) and sustained vasodilation of 
extracranial arteries ;21,30,31(2) PACAP38- induced migraine -like attacks respond to 
triptans;32,33(3) plasma concentrations of PACAP38 are elevated during spontaneous
migraine attacks (ictal), as compared to inter -ictal levels ;33and (4) in patients with migraine 
headache, plasma PACAP 38 levels decrease after sumatriptan treatment correlating with 
headache amelioration.34
PACAP differs from calcitonin gene -related peptide (GCRP) in that it has greater SPG and 
parasympathetic involvement.[ADDRESS_769891] neurogenic inflammatory processes and central pain signalling and 
sensit ization.40,41
Lu AG09222 is a humanize d monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of PACAP and is 
being developed by H. Lundbeck A/S for the treatment of conditions that may benefit from 
the inhibition of PACAP, including migraine.  Lu AG09222 binds with high affinity to both 
PACAP38 and PACAP27, thus blocking signalling through the PACAP receptors (PAC1- R, 
VPAC1 -R, and VPAC2- R) and inhibits endogenously released PA CAP in vivo.  Considering 
the clinical observations that support a mechanistic role for PACAP in migraine and the 
ability of Lu AG09222 to inhibit PACAP, Lu AG09222 may potentially provide efficacy in 
migraine populations based on a mechanism of action tha t differs from currently available 
preventive treatments for migraine.
The following sections provide a brief overview of the nonclinical and clinical data currently 
available for LuAG09222 .  Refer to the current version of the Investigator ’s Brochure for

in the reporting phase. Thus, the data are preliminary and based on a cut-off date of 
24 September 2020, corresponding to the database lock (DBL). This was a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose Phase I study to determine the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of Lu AG09222. The study incl uded healthy men and women aged 18 to 
55 years and comprised two parts:  a dose-escalating part (Part A) and an expanded-cohort 
part to assess the combination treatment of Lu AG09222 and sumatriptan (Part B).  In Part A, 
8 healthy men per cohort (Cohorts 1 to 7) were randomized (3:1) to Lu AG09222 IV in single 
ascending doses of  and  or placebo.  Additionally, 8 healthy 
women (Cohort 8) were randomized (3:1) to Lu AG09222 IV to or placebo. In 
Part B, 8 healthy men and 8 healthy women were randomized (1:1) in Cohort 9 to 
Lu AG09222  IV (dose determined based on Part A) or placebo, both treatments in 
combination with sumatriptan 6 mg SC administered 2 hours after the end of the IV infusion.  
In Cohort 10, 8 healthy men and 8 healthy women were randomized (3:1) to Lu AG09222 
 SC or placebo.
Preliminary safety data from the FIH study indicate that administration of Lu AG09222 in 
single doses of and  in healthy subjects is generally safe and 
well tolerated.  A total of 96 healthy subjects received placebo, Lu AG09222 IV or SC, 
Lu AG09222 IV plus sumatriptan SC, or placebo plus sumatriptan SC.
Of the 60 subjects treated with Lu AG0922 IV or SC, 32 had a total of 65 non-serious 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), while 8 of 8 subjects treated with Lu AG09222 
plus sumatriptan had a total of 17 TEAEs.  No subjects died or withdrew due to adverse 
events during the study.

doses of Lu AG0922 to indicate a causal relationship between the TEAEs and Lu AG09222.  
There were no clinically significant findings or trends in clinical safety laboratory tests, vital 
signs, QT intervals, or physical or eye examinations.
Of the 68 subjects who received Lu AG [ZIP_CODE], 8 subjects were ADA-positive during the 
study, with no positive ADA tests observed before Day 84 after IMP administration 
(corresponding to approximately  Lu AG09222).  Of those, only one 
subject was positive for ADAs at the 6-month follow up.  All ADA-positive results were 
NAb-negative during the study, except at the 3-month follow-up, where 2 subjects were 
Nab-positive. None of the ADA-positive subjects had TEAEs associated with 
immunogenicity.

Study 19678A – Clinical Study Protocol Page 50 of 1096.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment
The IRT will be used in this study.  Each patient will be assigned a screening number by [CONTACT_21436], and that number will be used to identify the patient throughout the study.  
Randomization of the patient will be performed in the IRT.  The IRT allocates the patient to a 
treatment group and assigns the patient a randomization number in accordance with the 
specifications from Biostatistics, H. Lundbeck A/S.
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (North America versus Europe)  
6.5 IMP Accountability
IMP accountability is documented in the IRT by [CONTACT_585501] 
(CRA).
The investigator and the pharmacist must agree to only dispense IMP to patients enrolled in 
the study.  The unblinded pharmacist must maintain an adequate record of the receipt and 
distribution of the IMP.  This record must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_585502].
6.6 Unblinding Procedures
Global Patient Safety, H. Lundbeck A/S, the investigator or the pharmacist (if applicable) and 
the DMC will have access to the unblinded information for the double-blind treatment for 
each patient.  Access to these details will be via IRT.
The IRT unblinding procedure is described in the IRT User Guide .
The investigator may only break the code for a patient if knowledge of the IMP is necessary 
to provide optimal treatment to the patient in an emergency situation.  If possible, the 
investigator must consult the CRA (in some cases it may be the medical monitor) before 
breaking the code.  The investigator must record the date and reason for breaking the code on 
the IMP Code Break Form .  If the emergency situation was an adverse event, it must be 
recorded on an Adverse Event Form .  The CRA (in some cases it may be the medical monitor)
must be notified immediately.  The IRT will capture the date and time of the code break call.  
Information on the allocated treatment will be provided during the call and by [CONTACT_40743],
depending on availability/preference.  When the code is broken for a patient, the patient must 
be immediately withdrawn from the study.  If this occurs during a visit, the investigator must 
complete the visit as a Withdrawal Visit; otherwise, the patient will be asked to have a 
Withdrawal Visit.

8.1 Overview
An overview of the procedures and assessments to be conducted during the study and their 
timing is presented in Panel 2.  Further details are in chapte r9.
Appropriate risk assessment and mitigations will be done in case of restrictions due to 
COVID -19, which will be described in detail in a separate COVID -19 mitigation plan.
The Screening Visit (Visit 1) is performed 28 to 30 days before the Baseline Visit ( Visit 2).
At the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) ,the IMP is administered.  The Primary Outcome Visit (Visit 4)

Confidential
Study 19678A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 52of 109is performed 4 weeks after the Baseline Visit.  A Safety Follow -up Visit (Visit 6) is 
performed 8 weeks after the Primary Outcome Visit.
At the visit s,all assessments may be completed over a maximum of 2 consecutive days (with 
the exception of PROs -see paragraph below); if so, the first day is considered the “visit” day 
according to the schedule.
If the date of a visit does not conform to the schedule, subsequent visits should be planned to 
maintain the visit schedule relative to the Baseline Visit.
Patients will record eDiary headache data on a daily basis from the Screening Visit until the 
Safety Follow -
up Visit or Efficacy Follow -up/Withdrawal Vis it .  At each visit, a compliance 
check of eDiary (based on eDiary reporting) will be conducted.  Additionally, ongoing 
evaluation of eDiary compliance will be performed by [CONTACT_585503]- compli ance.  See section [IP_ADDRESS] for further details on 
eDiary.
Patients will complete the PROs in alignment with scheduled visit dates.PROs scheduled at 
the Baseline Vi sit (Visit 2) must be completed in the clinic at the visit date and before the 
infusion. PROs scheduled in alignment with all other visits can be completed on the day or 
within 3 days prior to the scheduled visit date. See section 9.2.1 for further details on PROs.
Patients who withdraw prior to the Primary Outcome Visit (Week 4) , except for those who 
withdraw their consent, will have a Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible, an Efficacy Follow -
up (Phone Contact) Visit at Week 4 ,and a further Safety Follow -up Visit at 12 weeks after 
administration of the IMP ( theBaseline Visit ).If the Withdrawal Visit takes place at Week 4, 
an Efficacy Follow -
up (Phone Contact) Visit at Wee k 4 is not required (see section 8.10).
Visit 3, Visit 4 (Primary Outcome Visit), Visit 5, and Withdrawal Visit can be conducted as a 
clinic visit to the site by [CONTACT_585504] a home visit by a healthcare 
provi der/study site staff with or without a televisit through teleconferencing. Before these 
visits are conducted, patients will have the option to choose the types of visits to be conducted 
and these are allowed to be changed during the study .  The type of vi sits conducted must be 
recorded in the eCRF.   Further information on the type of visits will be provided in the Site 
Guide for Off-Site Nursing Services and TeleVisit Solutions Site Reference Guide .
After completing or withdrawing from the study, the patient must be treated in accordance 
with usual clinical practice.
8.2 Screening Visit (Visit 1)
The Screening Visit must be conducted as a visit to the site. Signed informed consent must be 
in place before any study -related assessments are performed (including collection of relevant 
documentation from the patient’s treating physician) and may be obtained prior to the 
Screening Visit. See section 9.1forfurther details on screening assessments and chapter 12
for further details on relevant documentation from the treating physician.

9.5.7 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C -SSRS is a ClinRO.  The C-SSRS is a semi -structured interview developed to 
systematically assess suicidal ideation and behaviour of patients participating in a clinical 
study.58  The C -SSRS has 5 questions addressing suicidal ideation, fivesub-questions 
assessing the intensity o f ideation, and four questions addressing suicidal behaviour. For this 
study, the following versions of the scale are used: the “Baseline/Screening” version will be 
used at the Screening Visit and the “Since last visit” version will be used for all subsequent 
visits. It takes approximately [ADDRESS_769918], or (neuro -) psychologist involved in clinical practice or regularly 
evaluating patients. Any except ions must be discussed and approved by [CONTACT_42057]/or its 
designee. For each individual patient, the same certified rater should preferably rate the 
patient throughout the study. In case of unforeseen circumstances, certified back -up raters

10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions60
Adverse event – is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended s ign (including clinically 
significant out -of-range values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory tests, 
vital signs, ECGs, safety COAs), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, regardless of whether i t is considered related to the medicinal product.
It is Lundbeck policy to collect and record all adverse events, including pre -treatment adverse 
events, that is, those that start after the patient has signed the Informed Consent Form and 
prior to the firs t dose of IMP.
Serious adverse event –is any adverse event that:
results in death
is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death had it been more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_585488]
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
is medically important (this refers to an event that may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298], but may jeopard izethe patient or may require 
intervention to prevent any of the SAEs defined above)
Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment fo r allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_585489] a condition that existed before the 
patient signed the Informed Consent Form and that did not change in intensity are not adverse 
events.  Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41980]; however, they must be evaluated to determine whether they meet any of the 
SAE definitions (for example, life -threatening or other serious [medically important] event) .
Non-serious adverse event –is any adverse event that does not meet the definition of an SAE.
If there is any doubt as to whether an adverse event meets the definitio n of an SAE, a 
conservative viewpoint must be taken, and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE.
H. Lundbeck A/S
Confidential
Study 19678A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 82of 109Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction –is any adverse event that is assessed as 
serious, unexpected (its nature or intensity is not consistent with the current version of the 
Investigator’s Brochure42) and related to a medicinal product by [CONTACT_585513].
Overdose –is a dose taken by a patient that exceeds the dose prescribed to that patient.  Any 
overdose (and associated symptoms) must, at a minimum, be recorded as a non -serious 
adverse event.
10.1.[ADDRESS_769919] it on the Adverse Event Form :
Mild – the adverse event causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient’s normal ac tivities.
Moderate – the adverse event is sufficiently uncomfortable to produce some impairment 
of the patient’s normal activities.
Severe –the adverse event is incapacitating, preventing the patient from participating in 
the patient’s normal activities.
Assessment of Causal Relationship
The investigator must assess the causal relationship between the adverse event and the IMP 
using the following definitions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious 
Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
Probable – the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the IMP or recurs on 
rechallenge, and another aetiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.
Possible –the adverse event has a suggestive temporal relationship to the IMP, and an 
alternativ e aetiology is equally or less likely.
Not related –the adverse event has no temporal relationship to the IMP or is due to 
underlying/concurrent disorder or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal 
relationship between the IMP and the adverse e vent).
An adverse event is considered causally related to the use of the IMP when the causality 
assessment is probable or possible .
Assessment of Outcome
The investigator must assess the outcome of the adverse event using the following definitions, 
and rec ord it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
Recovered –the patient has recovered completely, and no symptoms remain.
Recovering –the patient’s condition is improving, but symptoms still remain.

no adverse event associated with the pregnancy has occurred.  Pregnancies must be reported 
to Lundbeck using the same expedited reporting timelines as those for SAEs.
An uncomplicated pregnancy should not be reported as an SAE; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309405] a normal 
birth should not be reported as an SAE.  If, however, the pregnancy is associated with an 
SAE, the appropriate serious criterion must be indicated on the Serious Adverse Event Form .  
Examples of pregnancies to be reported as SAEs (medical ly important) are spontaneous 
abortions, stillbirths, and malformations.
If the partner of a man participating in the study becomes pregnant, the outcome of the 
pregnancy should be followed if the partner agrees.  The partner must sign a pregnant partner 
informed consent form to allow the investigator to collect information to report to Lundbeck.
The investigator must follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy and report it on a 
Pregnancy Form (paper).  The follow -up must include information on the neonate a t least up 
until the age of 1 month.
10.3 Recording Adverse Events
Adverse events (including pre -treatment adverse events) must be recorded on an Adverse 
Event Form .  The investigator must provide information on the adverse event, preferably with 
a diagnosis, or at least with signs and symptoms; start and stop date s(and start and stop time 
if the adverse event lasts less than 24 hours); intensity; causal relationship to the IMP; action 
taken; and outcome.  If the adverse event is not related to the IMP, an alte rnative aetiology 
must be recorded, if available.  If the adverse event is an overdose, the nature of the overdose 
must be stated (for example, medication error, accidental overdose, or intentional overdose).  
If the intensity changes during the course of the adverse event, this must be recorded on the 
AE Intensity Log .
If the adverse event is serious , this must be indicated on the Adverse Event Form .  
Furthermore, the investigator must fill out a Serious Adverse Event Form and report the SAE 
to Lundbeck immediately (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of it (see section 10.4).
If individual adverse events are later linked to a specific diagnosis, th e diagnosis should be 
reported and linked to the previously reported adverse events.

SAEs to the EC or IRB and to act accordingly.
Lundbeck will assume responsibility for reporting sudden unexpected adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) to the authorities in accordance with local requirements.  In those Member States 
of the European Union that have implemented the European Union Clinical Trials Directive61

12Monitoring Procedures
Prior to allowing patients to participate in the study, the investigator must sign a source data 
agreement that identifies the sou rce documents (original documents, data, and records) at the 
site.
If the investigator does not have a patient’s medical records, the investigator /designee must 
attempt to obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_34405] a written summary of relevant medical records from the doctor 
who had treated the patient earlier and include the pertinent documentation in the patient’s 
medical records at the site.  The investigator /designee must obtain migraine history, general 
medical history, recent medication taken ,and p revious migraine preventive medication 
treatment failures (see section 9.1.1 for definition) within the 10years prior to the Screening 
Visit. The signed Informed Consent Form must be obtained prior to the Screening Visit if the 
investigator /designee needs to obtain relevant documentation from the patient’s treating 
physician.   
The investigator can delegate the task of collecting this information to appropriate 
site staff, but it is still the investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that the patient fulfil sthe 
eligibility criteria (this includes checking that adequate documentation has been obtained) 
prior to screening the patient .
Acceptable documented evidence of previous migraine preventive medication failures is as 
follows :
Medical record with medicatio n’s name, treatment stop and start date s
, dose level and 
reasons for discontinuation, OR
If the investigator is also the treating physician, the investigator can provide a dated and 
signed written note with the above information, OR
If the investigator is not the treating physician and medical records are not 
available/sufficient, the investigator /designee can either:

interview with date and name [CONTACT_585524], OR
Interview the patient to obtain the above information, then contact [CONTACT_585515].
If none of the above can be obtained ,the patient is not eligible for the study.
During the study, the CRA will visit the site to ensure that the protocol is being adhered to 
and that all issues are being recorded, to perform source data verification, and to monitor IMP 
accountability.  The visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of 
the eCRFs, the site’s recruitment rate, and the compliance of the site to the protocol and Good 
Clinical Practice .  In addition, the CRA will be available for discussions by [CONTACT_82317].
Source data verification requires that the CRA be given direct access to all the source 
documents.  Direct access includes permission to examine and verify any records that are 
important for the evaluation of the study.
13Audits and Inspections
Author ized personnel from Medical, Regulatory and Clinical Quality Assurance, 
H
.Lundbeck A/S, and quality assurance personnel from business partners may audit the study 
at any time to assess compliance with the protocol and the principles of Good Clinical 
Prac tice and all other relevant regulations.
The investigator must be aware that representatives from regulatory authorities may also wish 
to inspect source data, such as medical records.  The investigator must notify Lundbeck, 
without delay, of an announced inspection by a regulatory authority.
During audits and inspections, the investigator must permit direct access to all the source 
documents, including medical records and other documents pertinent to the study .
During audits and inspections, the auditors an d inspectors may request relevant parts of 
medical records.  No personal identification apart from the screening or random ization

Patient data will not be disclosed to unauthor ized third parties, and patient confidentiality will 
be respected at all times.
14Protocol Compliance
Lundbeck has a “no -waiver” policy, which means that permission will not be given to deviate 
from the protocol.
If a deviation occurs, the investigator must inf orm the CRA and they must review, discuss,

16.8.1 General Efficacy Analysis Methodology
All the statistical tests of the efficacy endpoints will be one-sided tests performed at the 5% 
significance level and all confidence intervals (CIs) will be 90% CIs, unless otherwise 
specified.
16.8.2 Primary Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
The clinical question to be answered with the primary analysis is: does Lu AG09222 prevent 
migraine in the target patient population?
The estimand that will be used to answer the clinical question is: the effect of Lu AG09222 
that would be seen regardless of whether treatment was administered per protocol and if no 
preventive migraine therapy was used and all patients were able to continue in the study.
The treatments that will be compared are the treatment of interest, Lu AG09222, and the 
reference treatment placebo.
The population that will be evaluated is the FAS including the target population as described 
in this document.
The variable on which the primary analysis is based is the primary variable, change from 
baseline in the number of MMDs over Weeks 1 to 4, which summarizes eDiary data across 
Weeks 1 to 4. If acute rescue medication is successfully used during a day, this day counts as 
a migraine day (see section 9.1.2 ). See section 9.1.3 for definition of a Migraine Day, 
Headache Day and Compliant Day during the Screening Period. The same definitions will be 
used for the treatment period.
The following intercurrent events (IEs) have been identified:
!Use of acute rescue medication
!Use of preventive migraine therapy
!Treatment not administered per protocol
These IEs will be taken into account as follows: use of acute rescue medication or preventive 
migraine therapy (different from investigational medication) is taken into account using a 
composite strategy. Incorrect administration of treatment is handled using a treatment policy 
strategy. 
The population level summary for the primary analysis is: the least-squares mean difference 
in change from baseline in the number of MMDs (Weeks 1 to 4) between the high dose of 
 and placebo, based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline MMDs as 
covariate and treatment (placebo, low dose, high dose), population (EM or CM), and an

an ANCOVA with baseline MMD as a covariate and treatment and population (EM or CM) 
as fixed factors. A population with 30% EM and 70% CM patients was assumed with standard deviations of 3.[ADDRESS_769931] deviation of 5.6
for the full population. The resulting required sample size is 86 patients per arm for the 
dose and placebo. No formal power calculation was performed for the  dose. 
A sample size of 43 per arm was considered sufficient to evaluate the relevant endpoints for 
this dose, which results in a randomization ratio of 2:1:2.  Adjusting for an expected 5% 
dropout rate, a total sample size of 230 will be required.
The cap of 30% for the EM population results in a similar precision (standard error) for the 
treatment estimates for the EM and CM populations.
Simulations are based on [ZIP_CODE] runs.

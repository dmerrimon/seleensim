2.0 Background/Rationale  
 
 The incidence of primary pediatric brain tumors in the [LOCATION_002] is about [ADDRESS_177041] common type of brain tumor of childhood 
(36% of childhood brain tumors). These tumors encompass a heterogeneous assortment of histological subtypes 
including: fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic, and mixed variants. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_153454] c astrocytomas, pleomorphic 
xanthroastrocytomas and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are also included. Furthermore, in young children 
there are some unique rare entities that behave like low -grade tumors, including infantile desmoplastic 
ganglioglioma s, pi[INVESTIGATOR_153455], and desmoplastic astrocytomas.  
 
  Although children with low -grade astrocytomas often survive many years after conventional treatment with 
surgery and sometimes radiotherapy,  there can be tremendous morbidity depending on the location of tumor and 
the effects of therapy.  These tumors constitute a heterogeneous group because of differing locations within the 
brain and varying biological behavior of different subtypes. For those  where total excision is possible, such as 
cerebellar astrocytomas, prognosis is excellent with over 90% ten -year survival rates with surgical excision alone. 
In contrast, survival rates in children with cerebral or diencephalic tumors are 40 -70% at five y ears with irradiation, 
but decline to 11 -50% at 10 years (Mundigers, 1990). Some tumors however may be unresectable/partially 
resectable, and radiation can have undesirable side effects in young children. While the most significant 
intellectual deficits oc cur in young children less than 5 years treated with cranial irradiation, the deficits recognized 
even in young adults warrant extending the age to 10 years for avoiding radiation. Chemotherapy regimens are 
used for high -risk patients (progressive tumor, r esidual tumor) as a means to avoid or delay radiation in young 
patients, but side effects of chemotherapy are frequent ly reported. N ewer forms of effective treatment that will 
have lesser side effects are much needed in childhood brain tumors especially lo w-grade gliomas. We propose to 
study the efficacy and toxicity of poly -ICLC, a biological response modifier in children with low -grade gliomas.  
PRO TEOMICS  
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 9  
 Current diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring of brain tumor patients are significantly hindered du e to 
limited understanding of brain tumor biology and response to therapy. The majority of CNS tumors cannot be 
identified or followed by [CONTACT_153509]. However, if available, such markers would be 
highly desirable and could be used to : 
 
• Detect minimal residual disease  
• Predict response to specific targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Predict or anticipate tumor progression  
• Distinguish tumor recurrence from post surgical changes or post -radiation changes on neuro -imaging  
• Augment current histopathologic cl assification systems  
• Improve current clinical and pathological treatment stratification schemata  
• Assess efficacy of and tumor response to specific biologic targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_153456] a primary tumor endpoint (e.g., small molecule inhibitors or anti -angiogenic strategies)  
 
 While such markers would be useful to prognosticate, monitor and treat all CNS tumors, its use in glial 
tumors including recurrent low grade astrocytomas is critical since these tumors are often biopsied at 
prese ntation, but not at recurrence. Often these tumors are not amenable complete resection or biopsy due to 
the eloquence of brain tissue they infiltrate (e.g., optic pathway, brainstem or hypothalamic gliomas),  or the blood 
vessels that they encase.   
 
CNS bi ologic material in CSF  
 Glial tumors tend to disseminate locally along white matter tracts rather than through sub -arachnoid 
seeding. Dissemination of low grade gliomas along the sub -arachnoid space has been reported in children with 
low grade gliomas .  Even focal tumors are frequently adjacent to CSF pathways (e.g., intrapeduncular foss a, 
third and fourth ventricles) resulting in direct contact [CONTACT_153510][INVESTIGATOR_872].  Yet examination of 
CSF cytology for these tumors is not standard. Given l imitations of identifying tumor cells in the CSF, 
methodologies that could improve our understanding of CNS tumors of all types are needed. This would provide 
a significant improvement in currently available knowledge about the biology of these tumors, and  could elucidate 
potential therapeutic avenues.  
 
 Proteomics, a relatively new area of research whereby [CONTACT_153511] a tissue compartment 
is analyzed, has successfully been used to identify novel biomarkers  in solid tumors (Zheng, 2003;  Khwaja , 
2007). Because proteins are effectors of all cellular functions, their measurement should represent the most 
direct means of cellular characterization and hence tumor biology. Because cells and their environment exist  in 
an integrated state, it has been possible to interrogate the proteins of extra -cellular compartments to assess the 
presence and impact of tumor cells. This has been done primarily using serum or plasma to establish a method 
of screening for the presenc e of low stage tumors.  
 
 An analogous extra -cellular compartment for use in brain tumors would be cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF). It 
circulates throughout the CNS and exchanges proteins with the extra -cellular fluid of the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. 
CSF is continuously created and reabsorbed, providing a real time steady state proteome. Unlike serum, which 
contains a highly complex protein mixture ranging from very low abundance proteins in the 10 -30 pg/mL range to 
very abundant proteins in the 35 -55 mg/mL r ange, CSF contains a less complex protein mixture (Omenn, 2005). 
Therefore, the CSF is more likely to contain higher relative concentrations of tumor -specific proteins  (higher 
signal to noise ratio) than serum. Taken together this makes CSF and attractive alternative to serum for detection 
of brain tumor related biomarkers.  
Poly-ICLC 10/22/[ADDRESS_177042] pediatric 
patients. With the development of proteomic technology, investigation of tumor related signals at the time of 
diagnosis through treatment, and then in remission and/or at the time of recurrence or progression is possible.  
 
 While CSF for seeding tumors is readily av ailable and routinely obtained for cytology, the systematic 
evaluation of the proteins within these samples could be of considerable scientific importance. In addition to 
identifying potential makers of disease or response to therapy, the glycosylation and  phosphorylation status of 
many proteins can also be evaluated. Studies in tumor tissue  have  show that such information reveals activity of 
different enzymes that correlate with  either  treatment response (Mellinghoff , 2005; Helgi, 2005) or progression of 
leptomeningeal metastases (Brandsma, 2006).   
 
 
Proteomics  
 CSF proteomics has been applied to many neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, acute brain injury and Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (Roh lff, 20 01). 
Reports of its use in neuro -oncology are limited, but demonstrate the potential of this technology to effectively 
identify tumor biomarkers. One study used two dimensional polyacrylamide (2 -D) gel electrophoresis to measure 
the relative quantit ies of two pre -selected markers, N -Myc and l -CaD, in the CSF of brain tumor patients (Zheng, 
2003) . Another used ELISA of CSF to identify Ost eopontin as predictive of AT/RT and correlated with response 
to therapy (Kao, 2005) . CSF proteomics using 2 -D gel e lectrophoresis in combination with mass spectroscopy 
and cleavable isotope Coded Affinity Tag (cICAT) was used to evaluate [ADDRESS_177043] the ability to access the 
CSF space and may be detected by [CONTACT_153512].  Currently there ar e several consortia actively studying 
protein expression in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_153457] (P ediatric Brain Tumor 
Consortium and  Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Consortium).  Proteins interrogated in the se 
protocols include those involved with angiogenesis and neovas cularity (EGF, VEGF an d bFGF), those involved in 
tumor growth and migration (s ecreted protein with acidic and cysteine rich domains (SPARC), attractin).  There is 
no consortium actively collec ting spi[INVESTIGATOR_153458].  A secondary goal of this 
study is to examine these proteins in the CSF of children with low grade gliomas who have tumor progression.  
Comparison of CSF protein expression of high grade and low  grade tumors is likely to help identify biological 
markers specific for tumor progression, or for tumor pathology.  
 
 
 
2.1       Pre -clinical studies:  
 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 11  Polyinosinic -Polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly -ICLC) (Levy, 
1985) is a double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that was used as an interferon inducer at high doses (up to 300 mcg/kg, 
IV) in short -term can cer trials some years ago.  These trials gave mixed results with  moderate toxicity , and the use 
of poly -ICLC was generally abandoned when recombinant interferons became available (Levy , 1987); 
(Rettenmaier, 1986); (Krown,  1985); (Theriault , 1986); (Droller , 1987); (Hawkins, 1985); (Nakamura,  et al 1982).  
However, lower dose (10 to 50 m cg/kg) poly -ICLC results in a broader host defense stimulation, including T -cell 
and natural killer cell activation, and cytokine release (interferons alpha, beta, and gamma, interleukins, 
corticosteroids, and TNF). Levels of serum interferon induced by [CONTACT_153513] -ICLC are relatively low and 
have not in the past been associated with anti -tumor action. Preliminary laboratory results of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_153459], TNF, IL -2, IL-6, or neopterin; this 
agrees with prior animal studies (Black, 1992).  Low dose poly -ICLC also has a direct immune enhancing action 
independent of IFN, including increased antibody response to antigen, and NK cell, T -cell, macrophage and 
cytokine activation.   While discussion of the complex immunostimulatory effects of poly -ICLC and the interferons is 
beyond the scope of this protocol, their role in the potential anti -neoplastic effect that has been seen needs further 
investigation.  
  
 Recent evidence suggest s that polyIC is a ligand for the Toll receptor 3 (TLR3) , an important component of 
innate immunity.  Another  action of poly -ICLC is a more direct antiviral and perhaps antineoplastic effect mediated 
by [CONTACT_153514], the 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and the 
P1/eIF2a kinase, also known as the dsRNA dependent P 68 protein kinase (PKR) (Chebath , 1992), (Samuel , 
1992), (Katze , 1992) (Williams , 1999). Double -stranded -RNA -dependent protein kinase PKR is a 
serine/threonine kinase which is activated by [CONTACT_153515]. Activated PKR then 
phosphorylates the  subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF -2, a modification that ca uses inhibition of 
protein synthesis. dsRNA induces an antiviral state in cells by [CONTACT_153516], 
which activates RibonucleaseL; as well as for the PKR, which inhibits initiation of protein synthesis (Levy, 1992); 
(Talmadge,  1985); (Levy , 1988); (Ewel, 1992); (Black, 1992 ).  Both, OAS and PKR are very sensitive to dsRNA 
dose and structure (Minks, West et al, 1979).  For example, simple, long chain dsRNA (as in poly -ICLC) is the 
most potent stimulator of OAS and PKR, while mis matched or irregular dsRNA can be inhibitory. Clinically , the 
OAS response is  maximal at a dose of about 30 mcg/kg  of poly-ICLC , and is much diminished above a dose of 
100 mcg/kg (M. Kende, unpublished). The clinical half -life of the OAS response to IM pol y-ICLC is about 2.5 days, 
suggesting an optimum dose schedule of two or three times per week (Maluish, 1985) (M. Kende, unpublished).  
Previously treated patients showed up to a [ADDRESS_177044] in response to treatment at 10 
to 20 mcg /kg, and a significant association of serum OAS with tumor response (P= .03) (Salazar, 1996). Similarly, 
the PKR has both high and low affinity binding sites and is inhibited by [CONTACT_153517] a dose of dsRNA (Galabru, 1989). 
Koromilas, et al, have demonstrated that expression of a functionally defective mutant of PKR results in malignant 
transformation in vitro, suggesting an important role for this enzyme in suppression of tumorigenesis as well 
(Koromilas, 1992).  They also suggest a possible relation to the p53 tumor suppressor associated with multiple 
malignancies Li -Fraumeni syndrome, which includes astrocytomas, sarcomas, lung, and breast cancers (Malkin, 
1990). Recently the role of PKR has been implicated in signaling pathways leading to transcriptional act ivation 
of the tumor suppressor p53, possibly through the PI -[ADDRESS_177045] (Cuddihy , 1999); (Williams, 1999).  
Folkman et al reported that the interferons exert antiangiogenic activity against the tumor vasculature supporting a 
potential antiangiogenic e ffect of poly -ICLC (Folkman , 1992).  Importantly, the length of therapy with interferon 
alpha is limited whereas the use of poly -ICLC has been extended for up to [ADDRESS_177046] effects. This 
capacity for extended use further supports our clinica l trial of poly -ICLC in low -grade gliomas where a more 
extended length of treatment (2 -3 years) may be required to establish a response to therapy. These multiple 
effects on cellular metabolism if sustained may mediate a broad -spectrum antitumor effect on a wide range of 
tumor cell types  (Fig.1) . If further studies confirm the hypothesis that OAS and/or the PKR may mediate the 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 12 possible antitumor action of poly -ICLC, this might help explain why the high doses of poly -ICLC used in early 
cancer trials were rel atively ineffective.  
 
 
                                             
   
                                                                   
2.2    Previous clinical trials:  
 
 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_153460] a possible beneficial effect of poly -ICLC in newly diagnosed and recurrent 
brain tumors (Salazar et al, 1996).  Thirty -eight patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic 
astrocytoma (AA), or recurrent GBM/AA were  treated with varying doses of poly -ICLC of 10 -50 mcg/kg IM, one to 
three times per week for approximately [ADDRESS_177047] twice 
weekly poly -ICLC showed regression or stabilization of tumor on MRI.  All but one patient with AA, who rec eived 
poly-ICLC without interruption, remain alive, with median progression -free survival of 54 months from diagnosis. 
This small study demonstrated the safety and tolerability of long -term, low dose intramuscularly administered poly -
ICLC at a potentia lly beneficial dose range of 20 mcg/kg  2-[ADDRESS_177048] chemotherapy regimens, with a longer med ian survival in months (119  versus 59) in WHO class 1 
tumors  (see Figure 2) . One hundred percent of patients who received the poly -ICLC regimen were alive at 2 
years versus only 76% who received standard chemotherapy  (Salazar et al, 1996).  This supports the 
effectiveness and likely less complications of poly -ICLC over chemotherapy.

Figure 2 . This table demonstrates median survival  (months)  of patients with prognostic class I -VI tumors treated in three large 
chemotherapy trials versus treatment with Poly ICLC. † Represents N= only one P -ICLC patient in groups II and IV.  
  
 Two adult phase II clinical trials  conducted by [CONTACT_153518] H’s North Ameri can Brain Tumor Consortium (NABTC)  
have been completed. The first trial evaluated  long term p oly-ICLC monotherapy in patients with  recurrent 
glioblastoma . This study  included 55 patients,  where  11% had radiographic response, 6  month progression -free 
surviv al (PFS) was  24% and medi an survival was  43 weeks. Poly -ICLC was well tolerated but did not show 
improvement on 6 month PFS.  The second trial included patients  newly diagnosed with glioblastoma. The 
treatment schema inclu ded a combination of radiation with poly-ICLC. 30 patients were enrolled in the  trial. The 
6-month progression -free survival was 30% and the estimated 1 -year progression -free survival was 5%. 
Median time to progression was 18 weeks. The 1 -year survival was 69% and the median survival was 65 
weeks. The combination therapy was well -tolerated. This study suggests a survival advantage compared to 
historical studies using radiation therapy ( RT) without chemotherapy but no surviva l advantage compared to 
RT with adjuvant nitrosourea or non -temozolomide chemotherapy.  A third trial is a combin ation study of poly -
ICLC with t emodar chemotherapy, and is being conducted by [CONTACT_18121]’s NABTT consortium.  
 
 A Phase I/II study of p oly-ICLC was conducted by [CONTACT_9525]  (Donald L. Durden), in children 
with multiple types of newly diagnosed or recurrent brain tumors. Long -term responses were seen in 2 of 4 
patients with low -grade gliomas (unpublished data). Four children with progres sive low grade gliomas treated on  
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_153461]. These four children had stable disease after documented progression 
for 10, 12, 22 and 24 mon ths while receiving poly -ICLC. One of these children suffered  from reduced white count 
(grade 3) that resolved despi[INVESTIGATOR_153462], and another developed respi[INVESTIGATOR_153463]. The other cohorts of recurrent high -grade gliomas and newly diagnosed brain stem gliomas showed 
minimal to no response.  All eight children enrolled due to growing diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas had 
progression of disease in <8 months of therapy.  Eleven children enrolled on the study had progressive high grade 
gliomas (anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma  multiforme).  Ten demonstrated disease progression within [ADDRESS_177049] a beneficial role in children with lo w-grade gliomas. However more  children with low -grade gliomas 
need to be studied to confirm this impression.  
 

Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 14  Phase I/II data for use of poly -ICLC has also been reported in patients with renal cell carcin oma, refractory 
lymphomas, melanomas, and colorectal cancers (Giantonio et al, 2001, Ewel et al, 1992). Varying doses of  poly-
ICLC from  0.01 mg/m2 up to 1 mg/m2 were used either IV or IM  2 times a week. In all of these studies, poly-ICLC 
was well tolerated . Grade 1 or 2 fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting and pain at injection site were seen in some 
patients and usually resolved by  24 hours after the injection (Ewel , 1992). In another study fever was a common 
side effect in 25.6% of patients, and chills in 23. 1% (Giantonio, 2001). In both studies stable disease and a partial 
response was seen in some patients: however no complete remissions were observed. Thus it appears that poly -
ICLC has been used in several types of cancers in varying doses and varying modes  of administration, and is well 
tolerated: however best results were seen in patients with brain tumors, at doses of 20 -30 micrograms/kg given [ADDRESS_177050] laboratory experiments to determine the patient’s cellul ar 
response to poly -ICLC, by [CONTACT_153519], the phosphorylation of eIF2 , and the activation of p53 
specific target gene, p21waf-1 in an attempt to better understand the anti -tumor effects of this drug.   
 
 
2.3     Drug Information and Toxicity:  
 
Drug Information:  
 Poly-ICLC is classified as an investigational new drug.  It is a synthetic complex of polyinosinic and 
polycytidylic acid, stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethyl cellulose.  The thermal denaturation point  is 89.5o 
C, about 40o C above that of plain polyI.polyC; the resistance to hydrolysis is eight times that of the parent 
compound, and it induces peak levels of about 1000 -2000 IU of interferon per ml of serum in monkeys given 1 
mg/kg intravenously.  
 
 The current study will be done under IND #[ZIP_CODE], held by [CONTACT_153520].  The drug to be used in this study is 
prepared and packaged in the GMP facility of Bioserv, Inc, San Diego, under the direction and under contract to 
Oncovir.  It is then tested for identity (RN Aase resistance and thermal denaturation) bioactivity in primates, sterility 
and pyrogenicity before release for clinical experimental use.   
 
Toxicity:    
 The degree of adverse effects of poly -ICLC is dependent on three factors: (1) dose, (2) route of inj ection, 
and (3) health status of the patient.  Early Phase I studies were done to determine the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) under the assumption that this was also the most effective dose.  In these studies of cancer patients, it was 
found that the MTD wa s 12 mg/m2 IV in 25 adult and pediatric patients (Levine and Levy, 1978).  Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_153464] 40oC, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise, nausea and vomiting, and mild elevations of liver enzymes.  
Fever was the primary dose -limiting factor.  At t his dose, the mean serum interferon level was 2000 IU/ml.  While 
this level is rarely attained by [CONTACT_153521], levels of 100 IU/ml in response to exogenous interferon 
are associated with the same types and degree of adverse effects as seen with high dose poly -ICLC.  Children 
who were terminally ill with leukemia could not tolerate 12 mg/m2 IV, although healthier children could (Leventhal 
et al, 1981).  In most of the early cancer trials, however, about 6 mg/m2 poly -ICLC IV was generally used .  Mild 
(grade 1), transient (7 days) hepatic enzyme elevations were described in a trial of 100 mcg/kg poly -ICLC given 
intravenously in multiple sclerosis patients.  In three patients this was prolonged >7 days, but in all patients the 
enzymes returned to  normal values after temporary discontinuation of the poly -ICLC.  One paralyzed multiple 
sclerosis patient in this group suffered a fatal pulmonary embolus which was not judged to be du e to the drug.  
Poly-ICLC has been associated with coagulopathy in dogs , but not in other species (including primates); and there 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 15 has been no increase in the expected incidence of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or coagulopathy 
in multiple sclerosis, AIDS or malignant glioma patients on low dose IM poly -ICLC.  
 
Low dose poly -ICLC :   
 It was subsequently shown that low doses were better than higher ones for enhancing immune effects, 
and that the higher dose actu ally inhibited a number of cell -associated immune functions.  It was also found that 
intramuscular injec tion brought about a much milder set of side effects.  The most common complain t is a mild, 
transient discomfort at the injection site.  On occasion, 8 -12 hours after doses of 10 to 50 mcg/kg IM, patients may 
also develop a mild flu like syndrome with feve r of less than 38oC which may last for another [ADDRESS_177051] little poly -
ICLC treatment.  Hepatic enzyme elevations are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_153465].  Several multiple sclerosis or 
malignant glioma patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) have been maintained on regular 
intramuscu lar poly -ICLC for as long as [ADDRESS_177052] been tolerating treatments uneventfully may develop a more pronounced 
fever with chills and malaise (typi[INVESTIGATOR_153466] -ICLC) in response to a single IM injection on 
subsequent dosing.  This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_153467].  Whether it represented inadvertent IV injection on those occasions is unce rtain.  In a previous  pediatric  
study  conducted by [CONTACT_079] , there was no dose limiting toxicity  seen over 3 years  in 45 children 
at doses of 20 -30 micrograms /kg given 2 times a week as intra -muscular injection.  
 
Summary of Poly -ICLC Toxic ity data reported to FDA, 2005:  
 In the two recent, ongoing multi -center NIH consortium studies in adult glioblastoma patients and in 
patients with multiple -recurrent anaplastic glioma, most patients (N=62) reported at least one adverse event.  The 
majorit y of adverse events were classified as either grade 1 (63%) or grad e 2 toxicity (28%). The reported grade 3 
and grade 4 toxicities were 8% and  0.8%  respectively. Only  two grade [ADDRESS_177053] frequently reported events (toxi cities) were fatigue, pain, and 
myalgia. Very transient  elevated liver enzymes, main ly grade [ADDRESS_177054] my elotoxicity, but is related to leukocyte trafficking, with transient migration of 
WBC to lymphoid organs, including spleen.

4.0 Study Treatment   
 
4.1 Treatment Schedule  
 
Children  will receive poly -ICLC 20 mcg/kg /dose  twice weekly IM (using Monday/ Thursday or Tuesday/Friday  
schedule if possible).  The first [ADDRESS_177073]/parent by [CONTACT_56636]. The study 
drug will be dispensed in vials along with  labeled dose syringes in order to minimize errors in dosing.   
 
Total length of treatment will be two years.  Each cycle will be 28 days in length.  If subjects  demonstrate a 
response  to therapy  (see section 7.0) , treatment may be continued beyond two years  at the discretion of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153473]. For statist ical analysis of toxicity , subject s will be divided into 
two separate cohorts (those with NF1 and t hose without NF1).  The subjects  in each of these cohorts will be 
treated and monitored identically throughout treatment.  
 
Subjects who travel to the coordinating or enrolling sites for protocol therapy may return home to the care of their 
primary pediatric oncologist after completing cycle [ADDRESS_177074] of care management at the discretion 
of the study physician/ committee. Subjects will be seen and monitored by [CONTACT_153529]. For those subjects, a [ADDRESS_177075]/family from 
their enrolling site. The enrolling site will con tinue to see the subject every 3 m onths for evaluation and will remain  
responsible for continued data  capture of all required information .    
 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 21 4.2:   Dose modifications based on Toxicity  
 
If  AST/ALT > 10x ULN while on study , Poly ICLC will be discontinued until the AST/ALT are < 5x ULN ; the study 
drug will then be restart ed at 20 mcg/kg /dose  twice weekly  (the initial dose).    
If AST/ALT > 10x ULN  for a second time , hold study  drug until values < 2.5x ULN; then restart drug at  the reduced 
dose of 10 mcg/kg /dose  twice weekly . 
Study d rug will be stopped and subjec t will be off treatment for toxicity if AST/ALT do not decrease to < 5x  ULN 
during the  first epi[INVESTIGATOR_36192] <2.5x ULN at second epi[INVESTIGATOR_153474] .  
 
For the NF 1 cohort, consider restarting drug again at 5 mcg/kg /dose  twice weekly if toxicities recur  at the prior 
reduced dose of 10mcg/kg/dose.  
 
For all  other grade 3 or grade 4  toxicities the same dose modifications will be followed. The study drug will be held 
until resolution of these toxicities to ≤  grade 1. If the toxicity is not resolved within [ADDRESS_177076] will be ta ken off protocol therapy.  
 
 
4.3:  Concomitant Therapy  
 
Corticosteroids and anticonvulsants may be given as indicated clinically.  However, if the dose of steroids is 
increased while on therapy, MRI must be performed t o rule out disease progression. Acetaminophen may be 
given as needed to control poly -ICLC side effects.  A non -P450 inducing anticonvulsant will be used whi le on this 
study (see Appendix 3).  
 
Radiotherapy may not be given while on study to the lesions being  utilized as measurable disease  in order  to 
assess response.  Patients may enter on study after completion of involved field radiation therapy, however at 
least 8 weeks  should elapse after radiation, and scans should show residual disease prior to entry on  study.  
Chemotherapy is not  allowed .  
 
Antibiotics, blood products and general supportive care measures may be used as clinically indicated.  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to be 
used as necessary and as per institutional guidelines. Give n the risk of  intratumoral hemorrhage with 
thrombocytopenia, a platelet transfusion should be considered if the platelet count is < 25,000/mm3. Higher 
transfusion parameters may be used if clinical ly indicated. All blood products will be leukocyte depleted and 
irradiated to prevent graft -versus -host disease.

A. Biologic correlates  
 
1.  Blood Specimens  
 
Obtain 5ml of peripheral  blood in a red top tube at study entry and at  day [ADDRESS_177080]’s 
research identifier  and date drawn . These specimens will be sent to the lab identified on the next page.   
 
Obtain [ADDRESS_177081]’s research identifier and date drawn. These specimens will 
be sent  to [CONTACT_144646] L. Durden’s laboratory for isolation of  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).  
Samples will be shipped  to the address  listed  below.   
    
Serum OAS and interferon , ,  levels will be measured by [CONTACT_153530]. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated by [CONTACT_153531] -hypaque density gradient separation and stored as pellets 
at –80 degrees C. Levels of PKR kinase, phosphorylation state of eIF2 , and th e induction of p21waf-[ADDRESS_177082] in vitro kinase and Western blot methods using phospho -specific 
antibodies as described by [CONTACT_153532] (1999).  This evaluation will provide a surrogate marker for sensitivity of 
patient’s cells to known capacity of poly -ICLC to activate this serine/threonine kinase and to activate the p53 
tumor suppressor gene activity.  
 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 25 Total RNA for  RNA sequencing or  microarray analysis of PBMCs before and after treatment  with poly -ICLC 
will be collected to determine differences in gene expression induced by [CONTACT_52362] -ICLC as index of somatic 
response to this agent. This will be compared to patient’s clinical response to poly -ICLC.  
Peripheral m ononuclear cells will also be studied by [CONTACT_153533] l Sorting to establish an 
immunophenotypic profile for each sample pre and post treatment with poly -ICLC. Regulatory T cells 
(Tregs), dendritic cells, mononuclear cells, macrophages, B/T cell subtypes, and pro -anti-inflammatory 
cytokines can also be analyz ed. This will also be tested to determine if these markers can serve as 
feasible additional biomarkers of disease and response.  
2. CSF Specimens  (optional)  
 
CSF will be obtained prior to initiation of th erapy with Poly ICLC . CSF will be obtained via lumbar puncture

Poly-ICLC 10/22/[ADDRESS_177086]. Currently, there is not a single mature technology available to meet all these criteria. 
Therefore, a combined approach will be employed i n this exploratory study to attempt to fit all of these 
characteristics and improve the body of knowledge about the utility of these strategies.  
 
All these approaches will require concentration of the samples using Centricon 3kD filtration and partial dep letion 
of IgG and albumin (Proteoprep Blue Albumin Depletion kit). Proteins can be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_153480] 15% trichloracetic 
acid, re -suspended in denaturing buffer and stored at -[ADDRESS_177087] component of th e proteomic approach will employ 2 -D gel electrophoresis to separated proteins in two 
dimensions according to their size and charge. The gels are then scanned and relative positions and intensities 
are quantitated by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_153481]. Individual spot s are normalized to total signal and proteins that are 
found to be differentially expressed can be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -gel digestion and MALDI -TOF-TOF mass spectrometry 
[Clin Chem 2005; 51:2031 -2042].  
 
The second approach to employ is LC -MS/MS in combination with stable isotope labeling. The entire sample is 
subjected to mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion. Individual proteins can be quantitated and identified from 
the peptides present in the digestion reaction. The protein complements contained in CSF f rom different disease 
states can then be compared.  
 
The third component is low mass fingerprinting. Peptides are isolated from the CSF by [CONTACT_153535] -filtration. These 
peptides are interrogated by [CONTACT_153536] -TOF-TOF mass spectrometry and profiles of peaks are generat ed. Peptide 
profiles are analyzed by [CONTACT_153537]. Combinations of informative peaks are compi[INVESTIGATOR_153482] 
“unknowns” to vali date their predictive power.  
 
2. ELISA for confirmation/correlation of target proteins  
 
CSF samples will be evaluated for expression of specific secreted proteins implicated in tumor progression, 
migration and response to therapy. These target proteins, de scribed above, have well -characterized, 
commercially available antibodies including VEGF, dFGF, attractin, SPARC and EGF.  
 
3. Interrogation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_153483] s.  If compelling evidence for biomarkers other than those described about becomes available 
as proteomics studies are completed in CSF of children with malignant tumors, inspection for these markers will 
be performed.   
 
 
5.5:  Pathology specimens  (optional)  
If the subjec t has available  fixed,  frozen and /or cryopreserved  tumor tissue  from a p rior tumor resection upon 
study entry it will be evaluated for genomics and other biomarkers by  [CONTACT_153538].

7.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
MRI Response Criteria:   Comparison of objective assessments are based on major changes in tumor size 
compared to the baseline scan. Determination of progressive disease is based on tumor measurements described 
below .  
 
Interpretation of anatomic (MRI) response rates in gliomas can be difficult.  Tumors may be non -enhancing, and 
certain area of enhancement may represent post -operative or radiation change. Shrinkage of enhancing lesions 
can also be seen for months after radiation alone. These factors may confound the MRI interpret ation of tumor 
respon se to poly -ICLC. Also in the Principal investigator’s previous experience, tumor regression or stabilization 
on MRI was seen at 12 and 52 months in some patients on poly ICLC.  Hence in the absence of clearly 
progressive disease (worsening neurological status, significant increase in tumor size on MRI), poly -ICLC should 
be continued for possible late benefits.  
 
7.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
7.1.1 Methodology to Determine Tumor Measurement  
 
All measureable tumors will be measured at eac h evaluation and will be used in the response assessment.  
Measurable Disease:  Bi-dimensionally measurable lesions with clearly d efined margins by [CONTACT_153539] . 
Evaluable Disease:  Uni-dimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not clearly defined.  
Non-Evaluable Disease:  Not Applicable for response evaluation  
 
For all measurable tumors, the 3 dimensional measurements: width (W), transverse (T), and length (L) 
measurement s need to be recorded (if length L can be measured), using either T1 or T2 MR weighted images 
(which ever gives the best estimate of tumor size). The following section describes the methodology.  
 
 
1. Longest diameter of the tumor should be selected in the  axial plane or the plane in which the tumor is best 
seen or measured, provided the same plane is used in follow ups.  
2. The longest measurement of the tumor (or width, W) should be determined.  
3. The 2 perpendicular measurements should be determined (tran sverse (T) measurement -perpendicular to 
the width in the selected plane, and the length (L) – tumor extent in the plane perpendicular to the selected 
plane).  
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 29 The primary tumor response rate endpoint will be based on the 2 dimensional measurements (TxW) as in 
modified MacDonald criteria (section 7.1.2), which, in addition to radiographic scans, comprise elements of the 
steroid use. The response rate based on the 3 dimensional measurements (TxWxL) will be a secondary 
endpoint (section 7. 1.3). 
 
All lesions are to be measured at each evaluation; however, if there are too many measurable lesions to 
measure at each evaluation (i.e. more than 10), choose the largest two to be followed before a subject is 
entered on study.  The remaining lesion s will be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status 
determination.    
 
7.1.2 Tumor Response Criteria on 2 Dimensional Measurements (per Modified MacDonald Criteria)  
 
a. Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease. There are no 
new lesions and no evidence of non -evaluable disease.  All measurable, evaluable and non -evaluable lesions 
and sites must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  Patients must not be on any steroid s. 
 
b. Partial Response (PR): ≥ 50% decrease over baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of 
all measurable lesions. There is no progression of evaluable disease and no new lesions.  All measurable and 
evaluable lesions and sites must be  assessed using the same techniques as baseline. The steroid dose at the 
time of the scan should be no greater than the maximum dose during the first 8 weeks since initiation of 
therapy.  
 
c. Stable Disease (SD): Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression.  All measurable and evaluable sites must 
be assessed using the same techniques as baseline. The steroid dose at the time of the scan should be no 
greater than the maximum dose used during the first 8 weeks since initiation of therapy.  
 
d. Progressive Disea se (PD): ≥ 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over baseline 
using the same techniques as baseline, or clear worsening of any evaluable disease, or appearance of any 
new lesion/site, or clear clinical worsening or failure to retur n for evaluation due to death or deteriorating 
condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer).  
 
 
7.1.3  Tumor Response Criteria  Based on 3 Dimensional Measurements  
 
 
a. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all measurable and evaluable tumors. There are no new 
lesions and no evidence of non -evaluable disease.  
 
b. Partial Response (PR): > 65% decrease in  the sum of  the product s of the three perpendicular diameters of  
the measurable  tumor s relative to the sum of products of initial baseline measurements - LxWxT (current scan) 
< 0.65 * LxWxT (initial scan) . There is no progression of evaluable disease and no new lesions.  
 
c. Stable disease (SD) : Neither sufficient decrease in the product of the three perpendicular diameters to 
qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease.  
 
d. Progressive Disease (PD) : >25% increase in the sum of product s of the three perpendicular diameters of the 
measurable  tumor s relative to the initial baseline measurement - LxWxT (current scan) > 1. 25* LxWxT (initial 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 30 scan) or the development of any new sites of disease. As post -radiation changes are often seen on post -
treatment imaging studies, classification of a patient as having progressive disease m ay require several serial 
MRIs . 
 
 
7.1.4    Response Assessment  
 
Tumor response will be assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months after starting the therapy, as well as at the time of 
going off study if prematurely.  The overall response rate (ORR) , defined as the percent of evaluable subjects who 
experience a complete response  or partial response  or stable disease , will be determined. The primary endpoint 
will be progression  free survival rate  (per MacDonald Criteria)  at 6 months after starting therapy.  Secondary 
endpoints also include tumor  ORR at 6 months and 2 years after starting therapy and also the duration of the 
‘good’ response. The traditional overall response rate ( CR's and PR's only) will also be summarized.  
 
Each subjec t will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of analysis of treatment 
effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the objective statuses described above.  
 
Any subject removed from study protocol because of unaccept able progression (see Section 8.1) will be 
counted as progressive disease in the efficacy analysis.  
 
 
 
8.0  CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY  CRITERIA    
8.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
  
a. Progressive disease  
  
Note:  Transient enlargement of enhancing disease with subsequent shrinkage has been reported during 
poly-ICLC treatment. Because of this, if the patient has progressive disease by [CONTACT_153540], the treating physician and 
patient have the options of continuing poly -ICLC treatment on this protocol or of discontinuing treatment.  
 
 b. Criteria for unacceptable progression:  See definitions of tumor progression outlined in section 7.1.3  
 
1. >50% increase in the product of the three perpendicular diameters of initial tumor relative to the initial 
baseline measurement – LxWxT (current can)> 1. 5 x LxWxT (initial scan), or the development of any new sites 
of disease independent of the response of the initial tumor.  Post radiation changes are often seen on post -
treatment imaging studies, so that classification of a patient as hav ing progressive disease may require several 
serial MRI’s if the child has received radiation within the preceding 12 months.  
 
2. Unacceptable worsening of neurological symptoms that cannot be controlled with corticosteroids.  
 
      3. Any other radiologic al or clinical evidence of worsening to the extent that the treating physician feels it is  
      not in the patient' s best interest to continue poly -ICLC.  
 
 c.   Physician determines it is in patient’s best interest.  
 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 31  d.   Patient and/or parent/guardian refusal to continue or inability to comply with protocol  
 
 e. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that does not resolve to Grade 1 within three weeks after interruption of therapy, or 
recurrent grade  3 or 4 toxicity at a reduced dose level (see section 4.2) . 
 
Note: If final analysis confirms a beneficial effect of poly -ICLC, and/or if tumor recurs after withdrawal  from 
poly-ICLC at the end of the 2 -year prescribed treatment period, participatin g subjects  may be offered 
continued treatment with poly -ICLC (subject to drug availability at that time).  
 
 f.   Completion of planned therapy.  
 
Subject s who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off Study (see below).  
Follow -up data will be required , unless consent is withdrawn , every [ADDRESS_177090] to follow -up. 
 c.  Entry into another therapeutic study.  
 d.  Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission.  
 
 
9.0    STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
a. The primary goal of this trial is to obtain preliminary estimates of the ability of poly -ICLC to prevent or delay   
disease progression in subjec ts with recurrent or newly diagnosed low -grade gliomas. The primary endpoint will 
be progression free survival  rate at 6 months (PFS6) after starting therapy . Progression free survival is defined as 
the time from starting study therapy to tumor progression, tumor recurrence, death from any cause, or occurrence 
of a second malignant neoplasm.  Tumor assessment for the primary endpoint will be based on modified 
McDonald’s criteria (section 7.1.2) . Tumor assessment results obtained based on the 3D measurements will be 
considered secondary.  The overall response rate  (ORR) at 6 months will be a secondary endpoint. The ORR  will 
include complete response , partial response , and stable disease (see Section 7. 1.4). Time to progression will be 
documented for all patients who progress.  
 
b. The second goal is to further define the side effects and toxicity  of this regimen in these subjec ts. Secondary 
endpoints also include tumor ORR  at [ADDRESS_177091] goal will be to examine a series of biochemical determinations ( e.g. serum OAS and interferon levels, 
PKR, phosphorylation state of eIF2a, p21waf-1) as surrogate markers for sensitivity of patients to poly -ICLC. These 
will be compared to clinical response data. A subset of the proteins involved in apopt osis and signaling pathways 
will be looked into specifically to assess the effect of the study treatment on these signaling pathway changes. The 
specific endpoints are:

9.1:    Study Design and Justification of Sample size  
 
9.1.1 This is a single arm study, to determine the radiographic progression free survival  (PFS) rate to poly -ICLC 
in the treatment of children with recurrent or progressive low grade gliomas. The primary endpoint is the 
progression free survival  status  at 6 months  (PFS6)  after starting therapy. The tumor response categories will 
include complete res ponse, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease , as assessed according to 
section 7.1.2 . 
 
Simon’s optimal two-stage design  will be used for this study (Simon, 1989). Suppose 50% is the 
uninteresting level, i.e., if the PFS6 rate is ≤ 50%, we will consider the new regimen as not promising. This 
50% baseline response rate  in the absence of  treatment  is from historical experience  (this rate was also used 
by [CONTACT_153541] a phase II study for recurrent or progres sive LLG in children ), also taking into 
account that this study patient population are more refractory . We will test the null hypothesis H0: p≤ 50% 
against the alternative hypothesis H1: p> 75%, where p is the PFS6 rate. The two stage design proposed below 
will have 80% power to reject the null and conclude that the true response rate is above 50%, if the true 
response rate is ≥ 75%, at 5% significance level.  
 
The study design  can be described in detail as follows:  
 
Stage 1 : Fourteen  subjec ts will be accrued; accrual will be held up until the PFS6 results for all the 14 subjec ts 
are known. The trial will be terminated at Stage 1 if ≤7 subjec ts ha ve a PFS6 response; otherwise it continues 
to Stage 2. Note that any subjec t who goes off study early due to toxicity , will be counted as a non -response  
(an intent to treat analysis) .  
 
Stage 2 : Nine more patients will be accrued. We will reject the therapy if among all the 23 (14+9) subjec ts, the 
number of patients who have a defined response is ≤ 15.  
 
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_153489] : Under this design, if the null hypothesis is true, the pr obability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_153490] 61%.  
 
9.1.2 Interim analysis and early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303]:  
The interim analysis will be conducted as soon as the first [ADDRESS_177092] accrued and are evaluable for the 
primary outcome.  If ≤7 subjects had a defined response, the trial will be stopped early for lack of efficacy.  
 
9.1.3 Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_153491]-ICLC 10/22/[ADDRESS_177093] 60% of 
doses are  administered to the subject, as assessed at 16 weeks. Less than 60% of doses administered  for any 
reason constitutes an unacceptable level of dosing . An acceptab le feasible  outcome would be the successful 
administration of the study therapy to 80 % or more of subjec ts at 16 weeks. Treatment compliance will be 
assessed in each cohort (children with or without NF1) when [ADDRESS_177094] 16 weeks of treatment. Failure to administer > 60% of doses in this interval in three out of the four patients 
will result in suspension of accrual to that cohort.  
 
9.1.4  Final analysis for the primary endpoint  
If the study continues, after all 23 subjects are evaluable for efficacy and safety the study data set will be 
locked.  Out of the total of 23 subjects, if the number of subjects with PFS6  is 16 or more, the conclusion will 
be that the trial has demonstrat ed a statistically significant improvement above a  50% PFS6 rate .  The final 
estimated PFS6 rate will also be presented, along with a lower 90% confidence interval.   
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_177095] one dose of the study treatment will be included in the analysis population. If 
applicable, “Intention -to-treat” analyses will be performed for an endpoint. If the endpoints for a subject cannot 
be assessed (for example, a  subject drops  early prior to the 6 months assessments  due to toxicity ), it will be 
considered to be an event that does not favor the study therapy (e.g., disease progression for the primary 
outcome).    
 
9.1.6 Accrual and study duration  
All the 23 patients are expected to be accrued in 3 years and the total study duration will be about 5 to 5.5 years.  
 
 
9.2:   Analysis of Results  
 
9.2.1:   Analysis of anti -tumor activity  
The " best response" rate is defined as the percent of evaluable subject s who experience a CR or PR or SD  (see 
Section 7.1.2 ).  The best response rates as well as overall response rates  at [ADDRESS_177096] lower one sided  confidence interval s for the true response rate s will be presented (Jung , 2004 ). The 
duration of response for each subject that has tumor response will be summarized in a table.  The same analysis 
will be done for the tumor response rate based on 3 dimensi on measurements as in section 7.1.3.  
 
9.2.2:   Summary of toxicities and side effects  
All observed toxicities and side effects will be recorded on toxicity sheets and the data collection forms. Toxicity 
information including type, severity, time of onset and resolution, and probable association with the study drugs will 
be recorded. Toxicities will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_153542]1 status (NF1 vs. non NF1 subject cohorts). Tables will be 
constructed to sum marize the observed incidence by [CONTACT_153543].  
 
9.2.3:   Analysis of  Survival  
Overall survival and progression -free survival  rates  will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier  method  (Kaplan, 
1958) .  
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 34  
9.2.4:   Analysis of biochemical measures.  
Laboratory studies will be done on subjec t’s serum and peripheral blood drawn prior to  and at two weeks after 
starting  treatment with  Poly ICLC.  Levels and changes in the measurement of serum markers and proteins such 
as OAS, interferon , , , PKR kinase, eIF2a, and p21waf-1 will be determined via proteomic analysis. For each 
marker, a Fisher’s exact test or a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to assess the association of a baselin e 
protein level or changes from baseline against tumor response status at [ADDRESS_177097] will be used 
if the outcome is progression free survival.   
All the p -values will be adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate 
(FDR) due to the fact that there may be thousands of proteins produced by [CONTACT_153544].  A marker will be 
claimed significant at FDR≤ 0.05.  To assess the effect of the study treatment on signaling pathways such as 
the one controlling apo ptosis, paired t -tests will be used to compare if there are significant changes from 
baseline for the proteins involved in these pathways. To assess differential effects on these pathways between 
the subjec ts who had a response and those who did not, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) can be 
performed to  see if a pathway is significantly up - or down -regulated in the patients with a response. These 
analyses will help to understand how poly -ICLC limits tumor growth and ultimately to identify patients who wil l 
benefit most from this form of therapy if it is effective.   
  
 
10.0:   ADVERSE REACTION REPORTING AND TOXICITY CRITERIA  
 
The timely reporting of adverse drug reactions (including toxic deaths) is required by [CONTACT_33438]. Reactions defin itely felt not to be treatment related should not be reported.  However, a report 
should be submitted if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_153492].   The 
reporting of adverse reactions is i n addition to and does not supplant the reporting of toxicities as part of the data 
reporting for this study.    
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  Timely reporting of all serious adverse events or drug reactions (including toxic 
deaths) is required by [CONTACT_153545], regardless of attribution. The reporting of serious 
adverse reactions is in addition to and does not supplant the reporting of toxicities as part of the data reporting for 
this study.  
 
Adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure 
regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attr ibution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable or definite).  
A Serious Adverse event is any adverse event, occurring at any dose that is fatal or life -threatening, results 
in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153493] a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event.  
 
Relationship/attribution:  The Investigator will be asked to document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_153494]:  
 
1) Unrelated :  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s).  
2) Unlikely :  The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s).  
Poly-ICLC 10/22/2010  
 
Revised 3 -13-12 35 3) Possible :  The adverse event may be related to the inves tigational agent(s).  
4) Probable :  The adverse event is most likely related to the investigational agent(s).  
5) Definite :  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s).  
 
10.1:  Reporting Adverse Drug Reactions Occurring with Investigational Agents  
 
Within [ADDRESS_177098] be reported to the study PI:  
 
• Subjec t identification number  
• Presenting diagnosis, Description of event  
• Laboratory data  supporting event  
• Total and daily doses of suspected drug  
• Time of event  
• Type and grade of adverse event  
• Methods used to recognize and characterize the effect  
• Physician attribution/relationship of event to study drug (see above)  
 
The participating site must  then submit a completed adverse event case report form to the coordinating site.   
 
Within 10 days of the adverse event , a completed NCI Adverse Reaction Form for Investigational Agents with the 
NCI protocol number should be submitted to the  IRB for life threatening (Grade 4) and fatal known reactions 
(except Grade 4 myelosuppression) or any unexpected,  unanticipated Grade  2 and 3  reactions  that are possibly, 
probably, or definitely attributed to the study drug .   
 
A completed (NCI) Adverse Reaction Form for Investigational Agents should be sent electronically  or by [CONTACT_153546] (see Appendix IV for the electronic links).  Oncovir will be notified as soon as an adverse event form has 
been submitted.   
 
10.2:   Toxicity Criteria.  
The NCI Common Terminology  Criteri a for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 4 .0 will be used and  referenced .  
The site, measure, grade , relationship, action taken, and outcome  for all toxicities (grades 3 and 4  as well as any 
unexpected, unanticipated Grade 2 reactions that are possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to the stud y 
drug) are to be reported on  the appropriate toxicity monitoring and adverse  event  forms.  
 
10.3: Data Safety Monitoring  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_177099]  
This study will be monitored in a ccordance with the UCSD/Rady Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153495] [ADDRESS_177100] . 
The DSMB meets on a regular basis to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMB 
Poly-ICLC 10/22/[ADDRESS_177101] reports for institutional review boards will be 
prepared.  
 
10.3.2 : Study Monitoring  
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_153496]’ eligibility , evaluability, and any 
toxicities that are entered in  the study database. In addition, the study committee comprised of the coordinating 
site members and at least 2 members of the particip ating site via phone conference will discuss and review 
once a mont h the enrolled subjects, toxicities, and integrity of data collection.  
 
Monitoring of Source Documents:  
The participating site will submit case report forms and copi[INVESTIGATOR_153497]. This will occur at a 
monthly interval from the time of subject’s enrollment into the study.   
 
Additionally a member of the DSMB at the coordinating site will monitor the data collection and the source 
documentation of all subjec ts enrolled at the enrolling  sites. This monitoring will review protocol compliance, 
drug accountability , and adverse e vent reporting as well as regulatory compliance  annually.  
 
10.4:   FDA Annual Reporting   
 
Oncovir, the IND holder of the study drug, will submit an annual report to the FDA. This report will include de -

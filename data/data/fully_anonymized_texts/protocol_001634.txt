Study Design This is a single-masked, 2×3 crossover, randomized-
controlled, dispensing clinical tr ial.  A total of approximately 
70myopic eligible subjects will be targeted to complete the 
study.  The subjects will be ra ndomized and fit (Visit 1) in a 
study lens and wear the lens for 3±1 day then undergo 
optimization (Visit 2) and wear the optimized pair forapproximately 1 week (7±1 day). At the follow
-up visit (Visit 
3) the endpoints will be measured and subjects will be fit in 
the 2ndstudy lens. The visits will be repeated wearing the 2nd
study lens (Visit 3 Fit/Visit 4 Optimization/Visit 5 Follow up). 
At Visit 5 the subjects will be fit in a new pair of lenses that 
match the same type and power they were dispensed at Visit 4, and wear the lenses for 1 week (7±1 day). At the follow-up visit (Visit 6) the endpoints will be measured and the subject 
will be 
exited from the study.
The primary endpoint will be logMAR visual acuity scores 
and the secondary endpoint wi ll be CLUE vision scores.
See the flow chart at the end of the synopsis table for the 
schematic of the study visits and procedures of main

2.STUDY OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINTS AND HYPOTHESES  
2.1. Objectives  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the visual performanc e (logMAR) and subjective 
vision responses of the JJVC Investigational Multifocal -PG Contact [CONTACT_838876]-6444, v1.0

2.2. Endpoints  
Prim ary Endpoint :
Visual Performance (logMAR)
Visual Performance will be assessed binocularly at each [ADDRESS_1165629] conditions. At distance (4 meters), VA is assessed using ETDRS 
Charts; while near (40 cm) and intermediate (64 cm) assessments will be made using reduced 
Guillon -Poling charts. See  in App endix Kfor details 
regarding the collection of visual acuity (logMAR).
Secondary Endpoint :
Subjective Vision 
Subjective vision will be assessed using the Contact [CONTACT_169754] (CLUE™) 
questionnaire at each 1 -Week follow -up evaluation.  CLUE™ is a validated patient -reported 
outcomes questionnaire to assess patient -experience attributes of soft, disposable c ontact 
lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact -lens wearing population in the 
US, ages 18 -65.  Derived CLUE™ scores usin g Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal 
distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where hi gher scores indicate a more 
favorable/positive response with a range of 0 -120.  A 5 -point increase in an average CLUE™ 
score translates into 10 % shift in the distribution of scores for population of soft contact [CONTACT_89626].6

4.STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Description of Study Des ign 
This is a [ADDRESS_1165636] -masked, multi -site, 2×3 crossover dispensing trial. Approximately 80 
subjects will be enrolled with an aim of approximately 70 subjects to co mplete the study. 
The study begins with an initia l visit (Visit 1). If a subject i s found to meet all eligibility criteria, 
they will be randomized to one of two lens wear sequences (Test/Control/Control or 
Control/Test/Test) in a bilateral fashion. 
If the subject is disp ensed study lenses at the initial visit, five additional visits will be 
conducted. The first follow -up visit (Visit 2) will occur 3±1 da ys after the initial visit. At 
Visit2, subjects will undergo lens optimization if necessary. Subjects will wear the stu dy
lenses for 7±[ADDRESS_1165637] follow -up visit (Visit 4) 3±1 days after Visit 3, for lens optimization. 
Subjects will return for their second follow -up visit 7±[ADDRESS_1165638] study lens per the randomization schedule and wear the lens for 7±1 
days.The final visit will b e the follow -up(Visit6).
4.2. Study Design Rationale  
Crossover desi gns are a well -established study design in which subjects are exposed to multiple 
treatments during different time periods.  A 2×[ADDRESS_1165639] Article Allocation  
Thestudy lenses will be worn in a bilateral a nd random fashion using a 2×3 crossover design. 
A computer -generated randomization scheme will be used to randomly assign sub jects, in 
blocks of 4, to one of the two possible len s wear sequences: Test/Control/Control or 
Control/Test/Test. The random scheme will be  generated using the PROC PLAN procedure 
from Statist ical Analysis System (SAS) Software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS I nstitute, Cary, 
NC).[ADDRESS_1165640] or assign subjects.  The randomized assignment of 
CR-6444, v1.0

subjects will be performed at the first visit prior to the first fitting.  The following must have 
occurred prior to randomization:
oInformed consent has been obtained
oSubject meets all the inclusion / exclusion criteria
oSubject history and baseline information ha sbeen collected.
5.2. Masking  
This is a single -masked (partial) study with the subjects being masked.  The term partial 
masking is being used as subjects will not be told any information regarding the optical designs 
of the lenses beyond that they are intended to correct for their refractive error and presby[CONTACT_19555], 
however there are slight differen ces in the tint of the lenses which is impossible to mask from 
the subject.   
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not  be broken until all subjects have comple ted
the study and the datab ase is finalized. Otherwise, the mas k should be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_126110]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195].  In 
the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking must be docum ented in the subject record. The Investigator 
is also advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to the clinical site or Sponsor 
personnel. 
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations.  Subjects who are discontinued may be replaced.
5.3. Procedures for Main taining and Breaking the Masking  
The test articles mask shall not be broken unless information concerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject. The Sponsor must be notified before 
the mask is broken.
When dispensing te st articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes:
1.Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule/randomization scheme to ob tain the test article assignment for that 
subject prior to dispensing .
2.Investigator or designee will record the s ubject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization scheme if applicable
Investigator or designee will pull the appropria te test articles from the study supply. All test 
articles t hat are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed outside the clinical 
site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountabili ty Log in the “Dispensed” 
section .

6.7. Accountability of Test Articles  
JJVC will provide the Investigator w ith sufficient quantities of study ar ticles and supplies to 
complete the investigation. The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation 
for the test artic le accountability records. 
Test article smust be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study site 
personnel listed on the Site Del egation Log. All test articles must be acc ounted. This includes:
1.What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits .
2.What was returned to the Investigator unus ed,including expi[INVESTIGATOR_93785] .
3.The number and reason for unplanned replacements .
The Investigator will collect all unused test articles  from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test articles mu st be separated from the clinical study 
inventory of un -dispensed test articles and must be labe led with the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or 
monito rwill return all unus ed test articles to JJVC.
If there is a d iscrepancy between the shipment documen ts and the contents, contact [CONTACT_35501] .

in a single domain (i.e. 
vision) .For questionnaires where 
data where data is not related 
to a primary or secondary endpoint
, any PRO questions 
are unanswered (i.e., left 
blank).
In the case of a major protocol deviation, the decision of whether or not the subject will be 
excluded from the Per -Protocol analysis population will be made at the time of cohort 
review.
11.STUDY TERMINATION  
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipate d Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to stud y agent cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446]. In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor m ay unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and w ill discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are enrolled.
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_838867]’s results are compromised.
JJVC reser ves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_506718], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unw ise to continue at the clinical site.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If i t is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unre asonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible.
Should the study be terminated (eithe r prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512].
12.PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING P RODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS  
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to an y written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies relate d to the identity, quality, dura bility, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been relea sed for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site perso nnel, etc. The following a re not considered product quality complaints:
CR-6444, v1.0
Page 63 of 229JJVC CONFIDENTIAL

xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questionna ires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO) .”
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receip t at the 
investigational s ite.
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall -outs.
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e . tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where 
there is no deficien cy alleged by [CONTACT_423] .
Within [ADDRESS_1165641] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will tr igger an automatic email notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Cl inical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use 
is not configured to send automatic notificati ons or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness) .
xWho received the complaint .
xStudy number .
xClini cal site information (cont act name, site ID, telephone number) .
xLot number(s) .
xUnique Subject Identifier(s) .
xIndication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject) .
xOD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted .
xAny related AE number if applicable .
xDeta iled complaint description (scheduled/uns cheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.) .
xEye Care Provider objective (sli t lamp) findings if applicable .
xConfirmation of product availability for return (and trac king information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA,  or trained site personnel 
todetermine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious  Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel will follow section 13of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was poten tially the result of a product qua lity related deficiency, these 
procedures also apply and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally L eft Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be 
documented.

13.ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definit ions and Classifications  
Adverse Event (AE) –An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal labo ratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the in vestigational medical device. ”
Note :This definition includes events related to  the investigational medical device or the 
comparator , and to the procedures involved .Forusers or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigat ional medical devices .1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre -existing condition) that:

Non-Significant Adverse Events –are defined as those events that ar e usually asymptomatic 
and usually do not warrant discontinuation of con tact lens wear but may cause a reduction in 
wear time.  However, the Investigator may choos e to prescribe treatment as a precautionary 
measure .
Diagnoses and conditions that are con sidered O cular Non -Significant Adverse Events include, 
but not limited to the following:
xNon-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)
xContact [CONTACT_19573][INVESTIGATOR_19534] (CLPC)

xContact [CONTACT_35518], which 
necessitates temporary lens discontinuation < [ADDRESS_1165643] (ADE) –An ADE is an “adve rse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. ”
Note1:This definition includes adverse events re sulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction 
ofthe investigational medical device.
Note2:This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.[ADDRESS_1165644] (UADE) –A UADE is a ny serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test 
article, if that effect, problem, or death w as not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan, Inve stigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any

other unanticipated serious problem  associated with the test artic le that relates to the rights, 
safety and we lfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events  
In conjunction with the medic al monitor, the Investigator will ev aluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in section 13.1).
xCausality or Relatedness –i.e.the relationship between the test article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related ,unlikely related ,possibly
related ,orrelated -see definition in section 13.2.1 ).
xAdverse Event Severity –Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild ,moderate ,orsevere -see definition in 
section 13.2.2 ).
xOutcome –not recovered or not reso lved,recovering or resolving ,recovered or 
resolved with sequelae ,recovered or resolved ,death related to adverse event , or
unknown .
xActions Taken –none ,temporarily discontinued ,permanently discontinued , orother .
13.2.1. Causality Assessment  
Causality Assess ment –A determination of the relationship be tween an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be det ermined by [CONTACT_19575]:
xNot Related -An adverse event that is not rela ted to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures .
xUnlikely Related –An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomi tant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely .
xPossibly Related –An adverse event that might be due  to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or stud y procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inc onclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded .
xRelated –An adverse event that is listed as a pos sible adverse effect (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_838878], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of c oncomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very 
suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -challen ge and re -challenge .
13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment –A qualitative assessment of the degre e of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_126121]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and sho uld be evaluated according to the following scale:
xMild –Event is noticeable to the subject but is  easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject ’s daily activities .
xModerate –Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities .
CR-6444, v1.0
Page 67 of 229JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinica l Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xSevere –Event is intolerable, necessitates additi onal therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with t he subject’s daily activities .
13.3. Documentation and Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and docum enting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study  treatment or study procedure.  Adverse event s
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condi tion deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical ev ents reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the disc retion of the Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs andcomplete the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adve rse events must be available i n the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on t he appropriate case report form or electronic data system. 
All adverse events occurring while the su bject is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documenta tion of each reported adverse event. 
All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicab le licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom) .
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.) .
xDate the clinical site was notifie d.
xDate and time of onset .
xDate and time of resolution .
xAdverse event classification, severity, and relationship to test articles, as applicable .
xTreatment regimen instituted (where appropriate) , including concomitant medications 
prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements .
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed .
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any) .
xLikely etiology .
xBest corrected visual acuity at the disc overy of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event , if the AE is rela ted to the visual system .
Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related ’or ‘related ’to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visual system or not), a nAE review form 
must be completed .Additional dated and in itialed entries should be made atfollow -up 
evaluations .Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he /she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a cu lture of the corneal lesion will be  collected to determine if the

Clinica l Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
infection is microbial in nature . If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented t o allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adv erse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Te st Article shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre -treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolve d. If further treatment beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropri ate health care provider. The Investigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the stu dy. If 
a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to
record the reason for discontinuation. The Investig ator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjec ts with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test article, st udy treatment or study procedures, a s of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommende d by [CONTACT_737]. Non -ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study t reatment, or study procedures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow -up.
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e -mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours f rom discovery for any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non -significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to 
their requirements ( section 13.4.2 ). The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, st udy treatment or study proced ures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor  
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e -mail ortelephone, but no later than [ADDRESS_1165645] igator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/signif icant adverse event must be f ollowed up and all outcomes 
must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject  received. The Sponsor and study monitor shou ld 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately .
CR-6444, v1.0
Page 69 of 229JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinica l Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical jud gment for colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject .
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article .
xNotify the IEC/IRB a s required by [CONTACT_6179]/IR B reporting procedure according to 
national regulations .
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UAD E to the Sponsor and IEC /IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_1165646] report the result s of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_1165647].
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non -serious adverse events, including non -serious adverse device eff ects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities  
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reportin g must be reported withi n the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_838879] h Authorities.
The Spon sor will report applicable Adverse Events to  the local health authorities according the 
written guidelines, incl uding reporting timelines. 
13.5. Event of Special Interest  
None
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy  
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once  discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from cont act lens or solution rel ated studies for safety concerns, but due to 
general concerns relating to pregna ncy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Spec ifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visu al acuity that occur secondar y to 
systemic hormonal c hanges, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus.

14.STATISTICAL METHODS  
14.1. General Considerations  
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.
All data summaries and statistical analyses wi ll be performed using the SAS software 
Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).9Throughout the analysis of data, the results 
for each subject/eye will be used when avai lable for summarization and statistical analysis. 
Unscheduled visits will be summarized separately and will be excluded from the statistical 
analysis.
Summa ry tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequenc y tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variable s as appropriate. Continuous variables will be 
summarize d with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum 
and maximum). Frequency count an d percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will 
be provided for categorical data.
 
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_19586] (Test and Control) and will be performed 
separately by [CONTACT_838880] (Safety Population, Per -Protocol Population or Intent -to-Treat 
Population). 
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
This study was designed and powered to demonstrate that the binocular high luminan ce high 
contrast, visual performance (logMAR) of the Test lens at distance (4 meters) ,intermediate 
(64 cm) and near (40 cm) after1 -week of lens wear is non -inferior to the Control lens . Historical 
data for the Test lens with respect to visual acuity is pr esented in the Table below.

Visual Performance (logMAR)
Sample size calculation for Visual performa nce (logMAR) was carried out using Monte Carlo 
simulation methods using PROC IML. One -thousand boot strap sample s were simulated based 
on the historical data in Table 6above for each Position separately. An intercl ass correlation 
of0.8 between study periods was used. For this sample size calculation, we assumed that there

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
was no period or sequence effect si nce the Test and Control have not be evaluated together in 
the same clinical study. For each replicated sample a linear mixed model was used; lens was 
included as the only fixed effect.  A variance component (VC) covariance structure was used 
to model meas urements from the same subject across study periods. Seventy subjects to 
complete provides >99% power to meet all primary hypotheses (Distance, Intermediate and 
Near) associated with visual performance.
The plan is to enroll [ADDRESS_1165648] drop -out rate with be closely monito red, if an unexpectedly high 
dropout rate is observed, then the targeted to tal enrollment number maybe be increased 
accordingly to ensure that a m inimum of 70 subjects complete the study.
14.3. Analysis Populations  
Safety Population:
All subjects who were admini stered any test article excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At lea st one observation should be recorded.
Per-Protocol Population: 
All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and did not substantially devia te from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_35524] 
(Per-Protocol Population). Justification of e xcluding subjects with protocol deviations in the 
Per-Protocol Population set will be documented in a memo to file.
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:
Allsubjects regardless of actual treatment and subsequent withdrawal from study or deviation 
from protocol. At least one observation should be recorded.
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance  
All planned analysis for t his study will be conducted with an overall type I error rate of 5%. 
14.5. Primary Analysis  
All primary analysis will be conducted on the Intent -to-Treat Population. A sensitivity analysis 
will be conducted on the Per -Protocol population. 
Visual Performance (logMAR)
Binocular, high luminance, high cont rast visual performance (logMAR) will be analyzed using 
a linear mixed model. Sequence of lens wear, study period, lens type, distance (4 M, 64 cm 
and 40 cm) , first order carryover effect and the lens by [CONTACT_838881] e interaction will be included as 
fixed effects. Other character istics including, age, gender a nd race and ADD power may be 
included when appropriate. Site will be included as a random effect (G -side). The covariance 
between residual errors from the same s ubject and distance across stu dy periods will be 
modeled using either homogenous compound symmetry (CS) or unstructured (UN) covariance 
structure. The structure that  returns the lowest finite -sample corrected Akaike’s Information 
criterion7will be selected as the structure that best  fits the model. The Kenward and Roger 
method8will be used for the denomi nator degrees of freedom.

14.6. Secondary Analysis   
CLUE Visio n
CLUE vision scores at the [ADDRESS_1165649] (G -side). 
The covariance between residual errors from the same subject across study pe riods will be 
modeled using either homogenous compound sym metry (CS) or unstructured (UN). The 
structure that returns the lowest finite -sample corrected Akaike’s Information criterion7will 
Page 73 of 229
Clinica l Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
be selected as the structure that best fits the model. The Kenward and Roger method, (Kenward 
and Roger, 1997)8will be used for the deno minator degrees of freedom. 
Comparisons between the Test and Control lenses at the 1 -week follow -up evaluation will be 
carried out using two -sided 95% confidence intervals constructed for the least -square mean 
difference (Test minus Control).     
Secon dary Hypothesis 1:
The null and alternative hypothesis for CLUE vision to test for non -inferiority of the Test lens 
relative the Control lens is as follows: 
ܪ௢:ߤ்௘௦௧െߤ஼௢௡௧௥௢௟൑-5
ܪ஺:ߤ்௘௦௧െߤ஼௢௡௧௥௢௟൐-5
Non-inferiority will be declared if the lower limit of th e 95% confidence interval for the least -
square mean difference is greater than -5. i.e. P(ߤ்௘௦௧െߤ஼௢௡௧௥௢௟ >-5) ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1165650] completed the study. The 
interim read will include descriptive summ aries on all primary and secondary endpoints. 
Additionally, descriptive summaries on other objectives will also be prov ided including: 
CLUE™ Comfort, Handling, Lens Optimization  Summary, Mechanical Lens Fit and Slit 
Lamp Findings. Listings on any adverse events ,corneal infiltrates of other slit lamp findings 
may also be provided if necessary. 
14.9. Procedure for Handling Missi ng Data and Drop -Outs  
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of missing values will be included 
in the summary tables and listings. 
Subject dropout is expected to be one of the main reasons of missing data in this clinical trial. 
Past clinical trials don’t provide the evidence  that subject dropout is systematic or not -at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivit y analysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the propo rtion of subject dropout is greater than the 15%. The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANAL YZE will be utilized with a parametric 
regression method used to make at least 15imputations.[ADDRESS_1165651] an 
The analysis will be conducted according to th at specified in above sections. There are no 
known reasons for which it is planned to deviate from these analysis methods. If for any reason

a change is made, the change will  be documented in the study repor t along with a justification 
for the change.
15.DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVING  
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection  
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case re port forms (eCRFs) using the 
BioClinica EDC system. An authori zed data originator will enter study data into the eCRFs 
using the EDC system. Data collected on equip ment that is not captured in EDC will be 
formatted to the specification of the JJVC database manager and sent to JJVC for analysis.

During the COVID -19 pandemic, the additional risks liste d below need to be considered for study participants 
and study personnel :
Additional Risks Related to the COVID -19 Pandemic:
xThe p ossible transmission of the Coronavi rusinfection and consequent complications, beyond the 
risk of adverse events due to the investigational device and/or procedures .
xThe risk may be higher in an op tometric clinical study because of the close contact [CONTACT_126133] (since the investigator
must make the measurements close to the subject’s face) and, in addition the need for multiple 
follow -up visits/exams which may expose the subject to other patients and/or healthcare 
professionals who might be transmitting the virus ,even if they do not have symptoms.
xPotential disruptions to the study may be nece ssary due to current or future pandemic -related 
emergency restrictions, which may lead to delays in scheduled follow -up visits.
xSubjects experienc ingan adverse event related to contact [CONTACT_126134] -19restrictions. In this event, a ll assessments that can be conducted virtually will be 
completed by [CONTACT_126135], including
anunscheduled visit, up to discontinuation from the study , as appropriate .
Ifastudy subject is found to  have contracted COVID -19during participation in astudy, he/she will be 
discontinued from the study and follo wed until COVID -19Adverse Event (AE) resolution.
To help minimize the above potential risks, JJVCI recommend reviewing/complying with local, state, 
and governmental guidance for COVID -19 risks.

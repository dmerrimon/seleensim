For each participant, the monitoring period will begin upon consent for that participant and end on September 1, 2018 (for those who never receive a notification) or on January 31, 2019 (for those who receive a notification). Every participant who receives a notification will receive an in-app Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) survey within the app 90 days following the notification. All participants will receive a web-based End Of Study PRO (EOS PRO) survey that they will have until January 31, 2019, to complete. Number of Participants  We anticipate total enrollment to be approximately 500,000 participants. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is expected on approximately 500-5000 participants comprised of participants from two main subgroups (< 65 yrs, ≥ 65 yrs).

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of AF associated stroke.5 However, 18% of AF-related strokes occur in patients with asymptomatic or subclinical AF that is newly-detected at the time of stroke.[ADDRESS_790484] important public health implications.   Guidelines for AF Screening  Contemporary international guidelines on primary prevention of AF-related stroke, and general guidelines on AF management, recommend opportunistic pulse detection (pulse palpation by [CONTACT_597767]) in patients ≥ 65 years of age.9,10 Guideline statements recognize the demonstrated improvements to sensitivity for AF detection achieved through ambulatory ECG (both intermittent and continuous) monitoring. Professional society clinical guidelines and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force have not yet recommended systematic screening for AF in general or high-risk populations.   However, further studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of screening (e.g., sensitivity/specificity, cost-effectiveness, subsequent health care utilization, and downstream impact on stroke incidence), before endorsing broader AF screening approaches utilizing contemporary technologies.

Intermittent ECG monitoring over a 2-week period (Zenicor ECG, Zenicor Medical Systems, Stockholm, Sweden), identified an additional 20 of 403 (5.0%) participants with previously undiagnosed AF.7 Similarly, the SEARCH-AF study screened 1,000 patients with a 30-second single vector ECG rhythm strip coupled to a smartphone device (AliveCor Kardia Mobile, AliveCor, Inc., Ashmore, Australia).12 In this population (mean age 76 years; 44% male), newly-identified AF was found in 1.5% of participants. Recently, results have been published from the STROKE-STOP study, a large randomized control trial of systematic AF screening of individuals in Sweden who were 75 to 76 years of age.13 Patients were advised to assess their heart rhythm twice a day or during symptoms such as palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], with a handheld heart rate monitor (Zenicor ECG, Zenicor Medical Systems, Stockholm, Sweden). In the 14,487 patients enrolled, 12.3% were found to have AF, 3.0% were found to have previously unknown AF, and 5.1% of the screened population had AF and were not receiving adequate stroke prevention therapy. Screening resulted in the initiation of OAC in 3.7% of the screened population, demonstrating that screening can lead to AF treatment both in patients with newly-diagnosed as well as prevalent AF.  However, given the paroxysmal and asymptomatic nature of AF, brief intermittent screening strategies are highly insensitive and likely to only capture patients with high AF burdens. This issue is highlighted by a recent retrospective study that showed in patients diagnosed with AF after stroke, using a 14-day ambulatory ECG monitor, the median AF burden was 0.33 hours.14 Similarly, the investigation of prolonged ambulatory ECG screening (30 days) for AF after stroke, as compared to conventional 24-hour Holter monitors, detected 5-fold more AF (16.1% vs. 3.2%).[ADDRESS_790486]-worn devices incorporating multiple sensors.

As technologies advance and adoption increases, wearable health technologies will be able to deliver increasingly more complex information on patient health. To date, efficient utilization of these data sources to effect improvement in traditional patient outcomes has been limited. For decades, cardiac implanted electronic devices (e.g., pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators) have collected and transmitted real time patient data, ranging from measures of patient activity to life-threatening arrhythmia notifications. These systems have been shown to improve clinical outcomes (e.g., time to clinical decision and mortality) and serve as proof of concept for wearable health technology based patient monitoring. However, further investment and study is needed to develop and define wearable health technologies’ health care applications.   App Based Health Care Research   Traditional approaches to prospective health care investigation are limited by [CONTACT_597768]-up costs and large infrastructure requirements. Utilization of apps in health care research can streamline patient consent, data collection, and distribution of health care interventions (e.g., medical information, medication reminders, etc.).  App-based research also enables enrollment of a broader population.  ResearchKit, an open source framework to conduct medical research, developed by [CONTACT_469566], has been effectively used to operationalize large prospective observational studies. MyHeart Counts, a Stanford led app-based investigation of cardiovascular health and patient activity, demonstrated impressive enrollment metrics, with 50,[ADDRESS_790487] year of launch. Altogether, app based health care research can decrease the barriers to, and costs of, performing large studies quickly.    Apple Watch Irregular Pulse Notification Algorithm (IPNA)  Using observable variations in PPG signal intensity, changes in blood flow can be measured and beat-to-beat pulse measurements can be made. During normal sinus rhythm, there is minimal variation in pulse. However, during AF, the beat-to-beat variability increases significantly. Therefore, a PPG signal can be used to differentiate between a regular pulse and an irregular pulse that may be indicative of AF.  An algorithm has been developed by [CONTACT_597769] (IPNA). The time between PPG signal peaks observed during periods of minimal arm movement are marked as intervals between heart beats. A tachogram is a period of time over which heart beat intervals are measured. The degree of beat-to-beat variability is measured from spot tachograms over the course of approximately one minute intervals. An irregular tachogram is flagged when the variability, measured using a Poincare plot, crosses a predefined threshold. An IPNA checks

One example of such technology are PPG sensors that can measure heart rate and heart rate variability for exercise and training purposes. However, utilization of this data source to improve patient outcomes has not been fully realized in the health care field. An app-based heart irregularity algorithm that identifies possible AF from collected PPG data and then notifies the user of such potential irregularities could lead to widespread screening and subsequent early AF detection and oral anticoagulation initiation, ultimately resulting in reductions in stroke incidence.

Apple Heart Study Protocol Version: 8.0, Date : March 20, [ADDRESS_790491] 65 years of age. Those who are not enrolled immediately will be placed in a “waiting period”, and notified via a notification in the Apple Heart Study app when 
their opportunity to enroll is available. Participants will be required to provide signed informed 
consent; once enrolled they will complete a short questionnaire to collect demographic information and medical history, after which the monitoring period will commence.  
Monitoring 
During the monitoring period, upon the detection of a series of irregular tachograms, and based 
on the IPNA, the Apple Heart Study app will notify the participant that an irregular rhythm was 
identified.  When notified of a pulse irregularity, participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_597770], American Well Corporation (together with Online 
Care Group, the “Study Telehealth Provider”) administered within the app that will manage the 
participant’s study follow-up throughout study participation.  Following the first notification, 
the participant will be reminded daily to contact [CONTACT_597771]. 
This reminder will be repeated each day until the participant contacts the Study Telehealth 
Provider, for a maximum period of [ADDRESS_790492] made by [CONTACT_597772] #1. After [ADDRESS_790493] the Study Telehealth Provider and complete Study Visit #[ADDRESS_790494] notification. These participants in the fall -out 
subgroup who call after 30 days will still be able to initiate Visit #1 with the Study Telehealt h 
Provider and undergo remaining study procedures.

Such participants who are directed to either emergency care or urgent care will also be included in the fall-out subgroup.  Participants without urgent symptoms who received a notification and who confirm that they are not currently on an anticoagulant therapy or are on an anticoagulant therapy that started after enrollment in the study will then be offered an ambulatory ECG monitor (ePatch, BioTelemetry, Inc., Conshohocken, PA). The participants will be mailed the ambulatory ECG monitor, which the participant will then be requested to wear for up to [ADDRESS_790495] technical report that will be read by [CONTACT_597773]’s technical readers. This report will then be finally adjudicated by [CONTACT_597774] a double-adjudication fashion, and a final report will be made available to the Study Telehealth Provider by [CONTACT_597773].  A second follow-up visit (telephone/video), Study Visit #2, will occur with the Study Telehealth Provider once the ambulatory ECG monitor results are available.  If AF or any other arrhythmias have been detected in reviewing the ambulatory ECG monitor data, or if there are other non-urgent symptoms needing further evaluation, the Study Telehealth Provider will direct the participant to their primary health care provider, or other health care provider as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_597775].  The report and visit summary will be made available to the participant and also to participant’s physician or health care provider, if during Study Visit #1, the participant provides his/her physician information and permission to send that physician a copy of the report.  For participants who do not have an established primary health care provider, the Study Telehealth Provider will encourage and offer advice in establishing a primary care provider per standard Study Telehealth Provider protocol.  Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)  90 days after the irregular pulse notification, only those participants who received an irregular pulse notification will receive a separate app notification to complete the patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire within the app. These outcomes will include whether or not the participant contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] a primary health care provider and what additional treatments or diagnostic tests they underwent. They will also be asked questions related to measures of anxiety related to the notification.  Participants will receive reminders via notifications from the app to complete the 90-day PROs prior to the due date.  All enrolled participants, regardless of whether or not they received an irregular pulse notification, will receive an End Of Study (EOS) PRO questionnaire towards the end of the study. Those who do not receive a notification will receive the EOS PRO on September 1, 2018. Those who do receive a notification will receive the EOS PRO on January 2, 2019.This

Participants will receive reminders via notifications from the app to complete the EOS PROs prior to the due date. This questionnaire will include questions on whether or not they were diagnosed with AF, started an anticoagulant medication, had any new symptoms during the monitoring period including palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness, fatigue, or had any major gastrointestinal or cerebrovascular bleeding. For those who indicated a new diagnosis of AF, further questions regarding additional treatments or diagnostic tests will be asked.     4.2 Rationale for Study Design  The study aims to estimate how frequently AF is diagnosed on the basis of a confirmatory ambulatory ECG monitoring in participants who receive an irregular pulse notification, and to validate the concordance of the spot tachograms and the IPNA algorithm with cardiac arrhythmias detected by [CONTACT_597776]. To reach the required number of participants who receive a clinical diagnosis and undergo simultaneous ambulatory ECG patch monitoring, a large number of participants will need to be enrolled, given the relatively low rate of undiagnosed AF in our target population.

The app identifies epi[INVESTIGATOR_597759]. Device Description:  The Apple Heart Study app is an application that analyzes heart rate (HR) and beat-to-beat data captured by [CONTACT_597777] (PPG) sensor.  The Apple Heart Study app uses this data to identify irregular heart rhythms consistent with atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias.  Analysis is initiated when the Apple Heart Study app successfully retrieves approximately one minute of beat-to-beat intervals, defined as a tachogram, derived from the Apple Watch PPG HR sensor through HealthKit, a data repository on a user’s iPhone.  In practice, tachograms are collected and stored at selected times throughout the day when a user appears to be still enough for a successful reading to be taken.  If, and when, the Apple Heart Study app retrieves a tachogram and subsequently classifies it as “irregular”, it shifts into a “confirmation mode” and begins requesting, and analyzing, tachograms on a more frequent basis until it is able to confirm sustained irregularities or the confirmation cycle is otherwise ended. Upon completion of a positive confirmation cycle within a 48-hour period, the Apple Heart Study app provides a notification to the user on their Apple Watch and subsequently on their iPhone app. While the app is able to identify irregular heart rhythms consistent with atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, the app is not intended to diagnose atrial fibrillation, and any irregular readings or subsequent notifications displayed by [CONTACT_597778]/or by a clinician.  The app is not intended to be used on an on-demand basis and should not be used to guide medical therapy decisions. The Apple Heart Study app is not intended as an implant but rather is stand-alone software that runs on general purpose platforms (the Apple iPhone and Apple Watch).  The Apple Heart Study app is also not claimed or otherwise represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life.  The Apple Heart Study app is further not intended for use in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease, as the app is not an atrial fibrillation diagnostic device and should not be used to guide medical therapy decisions.  Finally, the Apple Heart Study app does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a participant as the app only serves as a method to detect irregular heart rhythms and

The participant will be asked questions based on study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The app will automatically determine eligibility based on the responses provided. If the participant is determined to be eligible, they may continue to the “waiting period”, based on the enrollment metering schema and study infrastructure capacity, until it is time for them to consent and enroll. The waiting period for each participant will end once they are able to enroll based on the enrollment metering schema and study infrastructure capacity. After the waiting period, before the potential participant can initiate the consenting process, the participants will be asked to re-confirm their eligibility. Upon responding, they will be presented with an in-app consent and authorization form to be read and signed if they agree to participate.   The study anticipates a very large volume of participants to be screened and consented in the initial days following study opening. There is a potential risk of overwhelming the study infrastructure if all participants are allowed to enter the study monitoring phase instantly.   To maintain operational efficiency, the study will use an enrollment metering schema, whereby [CONTACT_597780] (baseline characterization, and initiation into the monitoring portion of the study).

Apple Heart Study Protocol Version: 8.0, Date : March 20, [ADDRESS_790501] 1, 2018, enrollment will close. On September 1, 2018, no further irregular pulse 
notifications will be sent. Monitoring will end on September 1, 2018 in participants who never 
received a notification, and the EOS PRO will become available to this group.  
Participants who receive a notification of an irregular pulse from their app will continue to be 
monitored until the end of study for the purpose of data collection for the concordant Apple 
Watch and ECG patch monitoring analyses. A 90 -day PRO will become available 90 days after 
notification, no later than December 1, 2018.  The EOS PRO will become available to the notification subgroup on January 2, 2019.  
All PROs will be due by [CONTACT_597782] 31, 2019. After this date, all monitoring will 
end, the American Well line will be closed and no further data will be collected.  
7.2 Enrollment: Consent, Baseline Demographics and Medical History Collection 
The Apple Heart Study (AHS) is an app-based research study utilizing the ResearchKit open 
source framework on the iOS platform. As in other mobile-mediated research studies, the 
informed consent process in the AHS is conducted remotely in a completely self -administered 
setting with no required contact [CONTACT_597783].  
The approach to informed consent for the AHS has been adapted accordingly to ensure the ethical requirement of informedness, i.e. that participants are adequately informed about the 
research before participation, is met.  Potential candidates as well as en rolled participants will 
be able to contact [CONTACT_597784] (available 24/7 at 1 -[PHONE_12396]) anytime and have the 
ability to ask questions and request clarifications at any time prior to or during the study.  This 
hotline will be open from the study start date until study closure.  
Participants who successfully pass the eligibility criteria will be directed to a page requesting 
their consent to participate. Participants will be asked to read and sign the study informed 
consent and authorization document w ithin the app if they agree and are willing to participate.  
A copy of the signed study consent and authorization document will be available for review and download to the participant via the app.  The participant will be considered ‘enrolled’ from 
this point and the study app monitoring of Apple Watch PPG sensor data will begin thereafter.  
After consenting to participate, the participant will be directed to complete a brief 
questionnaire to collect self-reported baseline demographics and medical history.

No pulse irregularities that meet the IPNA notification threshold are identified from the time monitoring begins (after consenting) to September 1, 2018.  or;  2. Pulse irregularities are identified by [CONTACT_597785]. The participant is then notified via the app of this irregularity. Participants who receive a notification during the study will enter the positive notification workflow [see 7.4.1 Monitoring Workflow - Positive Notification].  All study participants who do not actively withdraw, and who do not receive an irregular pulse notification, will be invited to complete a web-based EOS PRO survey on September 1, 2018 and participants can complete this survey any time before January 31, 2019 [see 7.5 PRO Instruments].  7.4 Monitoring Flow  7.4.1 Monitoring Flow - Positive Notification  After the participant receives a pulse irregularity notification within the Apple Heart Study App:  1. The app notification will provide a button for the participant to connect with the Study Telehealth Provider. Participant will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_597786], even if pulse irregularity that meets IPNA notification threshold occurs at any time point until the study end.   2.

If no connection is made with the Study Telehealth Provider within 30 days, participant will be placed in a fall-out subgroup. After 14 days, the app on participant’s phone will send no further reminder notifications or irregular pulse notifications. Those in the fall-out subgroup will receive the positive-notification PRO survey at [ADDRESS_790503] with the Study Telehealth Provider.     7.4.2 Study Telehealth Provider Service Workflow  American Well ([LOCATION_011], MA) is a healthcare technology company that developed the telehealth platform being used to support study visits. The American Well technology supports mobile-based interactions between patients and providers during the study, in which both the participant and provider can see and hear each other through American Well’s proprietary videoconferencing capabilities. Virtual visits can be conducted using a wireless or network connection, meaning a study participant can initiate a visit from anywhere. American Well’s platforms are a SaaS (Software as a Service) offering—this means all operational hardware and support software is housed and maintained within American Well data centers and is serviced by [CONTACT_597787]. American Well is a PCI- and HIPAA-compliant, HITRUST-certified, federally recognized security platform.   The Online Care Group (OCG) is American Well’s clinical partner.  OCG providers are responsible for conducting the study required assessments at visit #1 and #2.  All OCG physicians are licensed, board certified, and have 10-[ADDRESS_790504] undergone a vigorous training on American Well’s platform.  Additionally, the OCG has an internal credentialing process that meets all standards as dictated by [CONTACT_597788]. The Online Care Group’s staff physician-led credentialing committee (comprised of a chief medical officer, staff physician, and director of behavioral health) reviews and approves all practitioners before they are permitted to practice on the American Well System.   Study Telehealth Provider Team, a term used throughout this protocol, relates to physicians from the OCG, Level 1 agents operating the 24-hour hotline and the Network Operating Center (NOC) staff who coordinates efforts to initiate shipment of the ambulatory ECG monitoring

All these groups provide services through American Well platform.  After the participant connects with the Study Telehealth Provider team, they will undergo:  1. Study Visit #1:   The participant will be asked about cardiovascular clinical signs and symptoms. If the Study Telehealth Provider concludes that the participant has a medical emergency, the Study Telehealth Provider will follow its emergency protocol and either instruct the participant and/or a family member, if available, to call emergency medical services (EMS) or will call on the participant’s behalf if the participant and/or a family member are unable to contact [CONTACT_108140]. Those with emergent symptoms will be moved to the fall-out subgroup and still receive a positive-notification PRO survey at [ADDRESS_790505] is not on anticoagulant therapy or is on anticoagulant therapy that started after enrollment in the study, and perform a virtual review of physical symptoms. The information obtained will assure that the Study Telehealth Provider Data Collection variables [see 7.4.3 Study Telehealth Provider Data Collection] are obtained. The Study Telehealth Provider will provide the participant information about the ePatch to those who have confirmed that they are not on anticoagulant therapy or are on anticoagulant therapy that started after enrollment in the study, answer any questions the participant might have and contact [CONTACT_597789] (ePatch). After the ambulatory ECG monitor has been worn by [CONTACT_597790] [ADDRESS_790506] attempt will be made to send the ECG report to participant’s emergency care provider.   After confirmation that a participant’s ambulatory ECG data does not have any of these life-threatening arrhythmias, the ambulatory ECG study will be processed into the adjudication workflow. The adjudication workflow is described in a separate charter.

Study Visit #2:   The Study Telehealth Provider will review the ambulatory ECG monitoring report with the participant and make any necessary recommendations to the participant.  The Study Telehealth Provider will then refer participants with AF, any clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias, or any non-urgent symptoms requiring follow up detected on patch monitoring to their primary health care provider for further treatment and diagnostic testing. For participants without established primary health care providers, the Study Telehealth Provider will offer referral per standard Study Telehealth Provider protocols. The ambulatory ECG monitoring report and visit summary will be made available to the participant and also to participant’s physician or health care provider, if the participant provides the Study Telehealth Provider information of participant’s physician and permission to send that physician a copy of the report.

Symptoms during ECG monitoring period 2. Actions taken by [CONTACT_597792] 3. Clinical assessment 4. Complaints  7.4.4 BioTelemetry ePatch Monitoring  
  The BioTelemetry ePatch Monitor will be used for ambulatory ECG monitoring. The battery life with a single channel recording is 7 days. The participant will be instructed to wear the ePatch for up to 7 days. However, the data collected from a participant will be considered adequate for a participant with a minimum analyzable time of 1 hour.   BioTelemetry will send participants, via courier, an ambulatory ECG monitoring kit containing one sensor and two adhesive patches. If the adhesive patch is no longer functional, the sensor can be moved to the backup adhesive patch. At the end of the recording period, the participant will be required to mail the monitor back to BioTelemetry using the supplied prepaid mailer.  Study Visit #1:  During Study Visit #1, participants will receive brief instructions on ePatch, get any of their questions on ePatch answered and be notified that an ePatch will be mailed to them within approximately [ADDRESS_790508] in transit, then BioTelemetry will issue a second ePatch to that participant. Any subsequent loss of ePatches will not be replaced.  After Initial Visit:

Those who return patches beyond 45 days will be included in the fall-out subgroup, however they will still be eligible for a follow-up visit with the Study Telehealth Provider. Those who never return ePatch will also be placed in the fall-out subgroup.  Study Visit #2:   Once the ePatch has been received by [CONTACT_597794], BioTelemetry will issue a notification to the Study Telehealth Provider. The Study Telehealth Provider will notify the participant by [CONTACT_34058] a secure email that their patch report is ready and will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_597795] #2. This visit will occur approximately 60 days following Visit #1, but will vary depending on the time it takes the participant to wear and return the ePatch. During this visit, results of ambulatory ECG monitoring will be reviewed and further clinical care options will be discussed. The report and visit summary will be made available to the participant and also to participant’s physician or health care provider, if the participant provides the Study Telehealth Provider information of participant’s physician and permission to send that physician a copy of the report.    7.[ADDRESS_790510] until January 31, 2019, to complete it.

If the participant withdraws prematurely from the study, the reason for withdrawal should be documented. Possible reasons for premature withdrawal may include, but are not limited to the following:   ● Withdrawal of consent: participant decides to withdraw from the study for any reason. This may be concluded if/when a participant taps the withdraw button within the app or asks to be withdrawn. ● Investigators believe it is in the best interest of the participant to discontinue the study, for any reason.  Withdrawal Process:  Participants will have the option to withdraw from the study by [CONTACT_53737][INVESTIGATOR_007] a “Withdraw from Study” button within the app. This will disable notifications and will result in a cessation of data collection.  If a participant calls the Study Telehealth Provider requesting withdrawal from the study, the Study Telehealth Provider will instruct the participant how to initiate withdrawal on the app. It will not be possible for any party other than the study participant themselves to withdraw from the study. In the few cases where the participant has received a notification, and has initiated contact [CONTACT_597807], and thereafter selects “Withdraw from Study” on the app, they may still receive follow-up communication from the Study Telehealth Provider.  In order to stop further communication, these participants would need to inform the Study Telehealth Provider Team that they wish to be withdrawn.    Once withdrawn, participants would be able to re-enroll only by [CONTACT_597808], but will be considered a new study participant without linkage to their prior data.  The following will be considered lost-to-follow-up:  ● Death of the participant ● Lost/stolen iPhone and/or Apple Watch

Apple Heart Study Protocol Version: 8.0, Date : March 20, 2018 11.2.3 Tertiary Endpoints 
1.Arrhythmias, other than AF, detected on an ambulatory ECG monitor that can also
result in an irregular pulse. These include sinus arrhythmia, frequent premature atrial
contractions, frequent premature ventricular contractions, intermittent heart block,
multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial tachycardia with variable conduction.
2.AF of greater than 6 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and 24 hours duration detected on
ambulatory ECG monitor following an irregular pulse watch notification.
3.Self-reported initiation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_597758], including anticoagulant, rate -controlling
and antiarrhythmic therapy.
4.Self-reported electrical or chemical cardioversion by a health care provider.
11.3 Statistical Approaches 
11.3.1 Estimating Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in the First Objective 
We have designed the study to estimate the proportion of participants age 65 or older 
diagnosed with AF within a 5% margin of error. In other words, we have designed the study so 
the 97.5% confidence interval around the estimate will have a width of 10%. Our analysis will 
include the participants 65 or older in the NAS. There is no hypothesis testing for the co -
primary outcomes. We use 97.5% confidence intervals to account for the co -primary outcomes. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_790518] ~99% power to detect whether the 
lower bound of a 97.5% confidence interval is greater than 0.[ADDRESS_790519] 
0.75 if the PPV is truly 0.75. The power will increase if the PPV is higher than 0.75 in reality.

Apple Heart Study Protocol Version: 8.0, Date : March 20, 2018 11.3.3 Secondary and Tertiary Analyses 
All secondary and tertiary outcomes will be analyzed as proportions with 95% confidence 
intervals. Outcomes measured at the tachogram- or alert-level will be analyzed in the EAS 
while self-reported contact [CONTACT_4490] a health care provider and initiation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_597760]. The self -reported outcomes will also be analyzed in 
the FAS. 
11.3.4 Sensitivity and Sub-Analyses 
As a sensitivity analysis, the estimates for the co -primary outcomes will be repeated for 
participants of all ages.  The proportions and 97.5% confidence intervals used to analyze the co -primary outcomes will 
be performed separately by [CONTACT_654] (<55, 55-64, ≥65), AF burden, type of AF and non-AF 
irregular rhythms. Additionally, we will perform chi-squared tests to test whether the PPV 
proportions differ by [CONTACT_597809]. 
To better understand the performance of the IPNA across the participant population, we will 
construct separate 95% confidence intervals around the proportion of participants diagnosed 
with AF according to tertiles of spot tachogram PPV observed in the secondary objective.

account for an expected small proportion of participants who do not complete all questions.

Apple Heart Study Protocol Version: 8.0, Date : March 20, [ADDRESS_790521] participant 
is enrolled (see Figure 1. Study Timeline). If a high number of alerts is observed ( greater than 
10%), enrollment may be paused or throttled downward in any age subgroup (<40, 40 -54, 55-
64, ≥65). If the number of notifications observed is less than the study infrastructure capacity, 
the numbers of participants invited to enroll from the “ waiting period” may be increased. 
An interim check will be performed upon completion of the first 100 ambulatory ECG 
monitors in any of the four age subgroups (see Figure 1 Study Timeline). The interim check 
will be performed for each subgroup regardless  of how many patches are received in other age 
subgroups. We estimate the check to occur at approximately [ADDRESS_790522] 
participant enrolled to check the following:  
1.At least 50% of participants notified of an irregular pulse are ultimately wea ring and
returning the ambulatory ECG monitor. A low rate of ambulatory ECG monitor usewould result in an increase in the rates of invitations to enrollment in any age subgroup.
2.Percentage of atrial fibrillation noted on ambulatory ECG monitoring is grea ter than
1%. A detection of atrial fibrillation less than 1% will prompt a cessation of enrollmentin any corresponding age subgroup.
3.Percentage of non-clinically relevant irregular rhythms is greater than 90%. If the vast
majority of rhythms detected on ambulatory ECG monitoring are due to other irregular,
non-AF arrhythmias, such as sinus arrhythmia, frequent PACs and frequent PVCs, this
will prompt a cessation of enrollment in any corresponding age subgroup.
The co-primary endpoints will be evaluated after 503 participants aged ≥[ADDRESS_790523] the Type I error as we will not be examining the final positive predictive values of the 
co-primary endpoints using this interim analysis. 
A much higher than anticipated rate of notifications and subsequent ePatch  evaluations may 
result in marginal benefit of additional participant enrollment. The following will be set as

Completion of 5,000 ePatches in total in either participants ≥ 65 or participants aged 22-64 will result in cessation of enrollment in the corresponding age group.  2. Completion of > 100 ePatches per week in either participants ≥ [ADDRESS_790525] of enrollment invitations in the corresponding age groups.   11.6 Sample Size and Power Considerations  We anticipate identifying 750 participants age 65 or older who qualify for an ePatch during the initial study period of 3 months. Among these, we anticipate a clinical diagnosis will be available on 503 participants. The proportion of participants with clinically important AF will be estimated and a 97.5% confidence interval will be constructed around the estimate. Similarly, a 97.5% confidence interval will be constructed for the estimated proportion of participants with clinically important AF among those who receive an irregular pulse watch notification of all ages. With [ADDRESS_790526] sufficient observations to estimate the proportion with a margin of error of 5% or smaller, regardless of what the true proportion is. Our decision rule for concluding the IPNA is promising to address Objective [ADDRESS_790527] ~98% power to rule out a PPV of 0.70 or lower (using the decision rule and assumptions described in Section 11.3.2). If we assume that we will sample 10 intervals from each person with an ePatch, then we will need 300 participants with ePatches to get 3000 observed intervals, which is well below the 503 participants required for the AF co-primary endpoint.  We are assuming that 1% of participants 65 and older will get a notification and receive an ePatch, which corresponds to 75,000 participants older than 65 needed to enroll in the study to achieve sufficient power. We additionally plan to enroll approximately 425,000 participants aged less than 65 during the study period. We are making the conservative assumption that ~[ADDRESS_790528] data available from their ambulatory ECG monitor.

6 INTRODUCTION This statistical analysis plan (SAP) is a comprehensive and detailed description of the strategy, rationale and statistical techniques that will be used to assess and evaluate the ability of the Irregular Pulse Watch Notification Algorithm (IPNA) to identify atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (AF) and guide subsequent clinical evaluation. 1. STUDY DETAILS 1.1 Study objectives Objective 1a: To measure the proportion of participants aged ≥ [ADDRESS_790536] demonstrable AF as confirmed by [CONTACT_597810].  Objective 1b: To measure the proportion of all participants with irregular pulse watch notifications who have demonstrable AF as confirmed by [CONTACT_597810].  Objective 2: To characterize the concordance between pulse irregularity determined using spot tachograms (approximately one minute of beat-to-beat intervals) and AF detected by [CONTACT_597811].   Objective 3:  To estimate the rate of initial contact [CONTACT_4490] a health care provider within 3 months after an irregular pulse notification.  1.2 Study design This will be a prospective, single arm, experimental study using participants wearing an Apple Watch with the Apple Heart Study app. Using observable variations in photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal intensity, changes in blood flow can be measured and beat-to-beat pulse measurements can be made. During normal sinus rhythm, there is minimal variation in pulse. However, during AF, the beat-to-beat variability increases significantly. Therefore, a PPG signal can be used to differentiate between a regular pulse and an irregular pulse that may be indicative of AF. An algorithm has been developed by [CONTACT_597769] (IPNA) within the Apple Heart Study app. The algorithm’s analysis is initiated when the Apple Heart Study app successfully retrieves approximately one minute of beat-to-beat intervals, defined as a tachogram, derived from the Apple Watch PPG HR sensor through HealthKit, a data repository on a user’s iPhone. If, and when, the Apple Heart Study app retrieves a tachogram

7 and subsequently classifies it as “irregular”, it shifts into a “confirmation mode” and begins requesting, and analyzing, tachograms on a more frequent basis until it is able to confirm sustained irregularities or the confirmation cycle is otherwise ended. Upon completion of a positive confirmation cycle within a 48-hour period, the Apple Heart Study app provides a notification (IPN) to the user on their Apple Watch and subsequently on their iPhone app.  Participants without urgent symptoms who receive an irregular pulse notification will be offered an ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor (ePatch). Participants will be requested to wear the ePatch for [ADDRESS_790537] certified clinicians will adjudicate the technical report generated from the ePatch monitoring to identify periods of AF and other rhythm irregularities. Additionally, this team will adjudicate the raw ECG data that is matched to the time period of the individual tachograms.   Participants who receive an irregular pulse notification (IPN) will receive an additional request to enter participant reported outcomes (PRO) three months after the notification. All participants, regardless of whether they received an irregular pulse notification (IPN), will receive an end-of-study PRO questionnaire at the end of the study, which is anticipated to be approximately one year after initial Apple Heart Study App availability.  1.3 Number of Participants Needed to Address Objectives The minimum number of ePatches needed was calculated based on our desire to estimate the proportions in Objectives 1a and 1b such that the 97.5% confidence interval around the estimate is no wider than 0.10 in both age groups (< 65 and ≥ 65). We derived the number of enrolled participants and the number of tachograms needed from the number of ePatches required to achieve our desired precision in Objectives 1a and 1b. The feasibility of our study relies on an assumption that 1% of participants [ADDRESS_790538] 750 participants age 65 or older who qualify for an ePatch during the initial study period of 3 months. Among these participants, we anticipate a clinical diagnosis (via adjudication of the ECG patch) will be available on 503 participants. The proportion of participants age 65 or older with clinically important AF will be estimated and a two-sided 97.5% confidence interval will be constructed for the probability of clinically important AF in this population (Objective 1a). We are making the conservative assumption that ~2 participants out of 1000 in the younger age groups (total of all participants in <40, 40-54, 55-64) will qualify to receive an ePatch, from which we expect at least [ADDRESS_790539] data available from their ePatch. A two-sided 97.5% confidence interval will be constructed among all participants for the probability of observing clinically important AF among all adults who receive an irregular

8 pulse watch notification (Objective 1b). With [ADDRESS_790540] 0.75 in participants 65 or older.  Our decision rule for concluding the IPNA is sufficiently concordant with ePatch is that the lower bound of a two-sided 97.5% confidence interval is greater than 0.[ADDRESS_790541] 0.75. The same decision rule will be applied to analyses performed on participants of all ages.  Our decision rule is sensible given the amount of data with which we will rule our algorithm produces clinically meaningful alerts. The properties of our decision rule are based on observing 3000 tachograms where the ePatch is concurrently available in participants 65 or older. The same decision rule will be applied to analyses performed on participants of all ages. We evaluated the properties of our decision rule using 1000 simulated data sets each with 3000 tachograms. We assumed 2250 (75%) tachograms were concordant with the ambulatory ECG monitoring and constructed the 97.5% confidence intervals using an asymptotic Gaussian approximation. With [ADDRESS_790542] 98% power to detect whether the lower bound of a 97.5% confidence interval is greater than 0.[ADDRESS_790543] participants being monitored.

9 2. ENDPOINTS 2.1 Primary Endpoints The co-primary endpoints of the study are   ● An indicator for whether AF of greater than 30 seconds duration was detected on ambulatory ECG monitoring for a participant who received an irregular pulse notification. (AF after IPN)  ● Simultaneous ambulatory ECG monitoring indicating an irregular rhythm consistent with AF during time intervals when the spot tachogram is positive for an irregular pulse among those who received a notification. This endpoint will be measured during time intervals when the watch provides tachogram data and the participant has patch data recorded. Each participant contributes multiple observations for this endpoint. (ePatch+)  2.2 Secondary Endpoints The secondary variables are ● Simultaneous ambulatory ECG monitoring indicating an irregular rhythm consistent with AF of greater than 30 seconds duration when the IPNA based on multiple tachograms is positive for an irregular pulse among those who received a notification. These positive IPNA triggers will not result in additional notifications to participant, but will be available for analyses.  Each participant contributes one observation. (IPNA+) ● Self-reported contact [CONTACT_4490] a health care provider within 3 months following an irregular pulse notification. (PCP PRO after IPN)  2.3 Tertiary Endpoints  ● An indicator for the presence of arrhythmias other than AF detected on ambulatory ECG monitoring that can also result in an irregular pulse. Arrhythmias considered include sinus arrhythmia, frequent premature atrial contractions (PAC), frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC), intermittent heart block, multifocal atrial tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia with variable conduction. Definitions of each arrhythmia are provided in Section 4.4. (ARR after IPN) ● AF of greater than 6 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and 24 hours duration detected on ambulatory ECG monitoring following an irregular pulse watch notification. (AFtime after IPN) ● Self-reported initiation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_597758], including anticoagulant, rate-controlling and anti-arrhythmic therapy. (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])

ANALYSIS SETS The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all participants who are enrolled in the study. The Notification Analysis Set (NAS) will consist of all participants who receive a IPNA. This analysis set is equivalent to the Notification Subgroup. The co-primary AF endpoint will be collected from these participants to evaluate Objective 1. The ECG Analysis Set (EAS) will consist of all participants who receive an ambulatory ECG monitor, wear it for a minimum amount of time providing a minimum analyzable time of [ADDRESS_790544] the EAS to participants who began wearing their patch within 14 days of shipment.

For proportions near 1 or 0, a potential drawback of this method is confidence intervals containing values outside of the range [0,1]. If we encounter confidence intervals with bounds outside of the [0,1] range we will instead construct the confidence intervals using the BCa method of creating a bootstrap confidence interval. Incomplete Dates If only the year of a date is given (YY), then the date shall be set to ‘YY0701’. If only the year and month of a date is given (YYMM), then the date shall be set to ‘YYMM15’. Descriptive Statistics Numerical variables will be summarised using standard summary statistics including the number of participants, mean, standard deviation, median, 10th and 90th percentile and range (i.e., minimum and maximum) as appropriate.  For categorical data, proportions will be presented in a frequency table format.   Multiple Patches per Participant In rare instances where a single user ID is associated with data available from more than one patch, only data from the final patch will be used in statistical analyses.

(cardioversion)   Sensitivity and Sub-analyses  As a sensitivity analysis, a per-protocol analysis will be performed for the primary endpoints excluding participants with protocol deviations.  Proportions along with 97.5% confidence intervals will be used to analyze the co-primary objectives and will be presented separately by [CONTACT_654] (<40, 40-54, 55-64, 65+), sex, race, medical history, type of AF, and non-AF irregular rhythms. Frequency of notifications will be estimated separately by [CONTACT_654], sex, race, and medical history in the FAS. These analyses will also be performed on participants of all ages combined.  To better understand the performance of the IPNA across the participant population, we will perform a subgroup analysis to understand the proportion estimated in Objective 1a and 1b according to the burden of AF. We will consider three approaches to split the participants into tertiles, each capturing AF burden or a related measure.  ● We will split the participants into tertiles based on AF burden obtained from their ambulatory ECG monitoring.  ● We will calculate each participant’s PPV by [CONTACT_597816] 10 sampled positive tachograms that are concordant with the ambulatory ECG monitoring and split the participants into tertiles according to the PPV calculated. ● We will split the participants into tertiles based on the time until AF appears on their ambulatory ECG monitoring.  For each approach, we will construct separate 95% confidence intervals around the probability of being diagnosed with AF in each tertile. These analyses will help us to understand how the estimates addressing Objective 1a and 1b differ according to AF burden.  We will summarize the self-reported contact [CONTACT_4490] a health care provider, use of subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_597758], and reason for not following up with a health care provider within [ADDRESS_790551] additional sensitivity analyses considering the following alternative minimum wear times: [ADDRESS_790552] of the adjudicated results. We will repeat the tachogram sampling in 10,000 bootstrap resamples and calculate the confidence interval in each replicate to generate a distribution of confidence intervals based on the resamples. We will graphically display the distribution of confidence intervals and will summarize the upper and lower bounds of the confidence intervals to characterize the uncertainty in our estimated confidence intervals.  Adverse Events A participant will be counted once for a reported AE even if the participant had multiple occurrences of that AE.

The reasons for inclusion in the fall-out subgroup are:  ● Failure to call Study Telehealth Provider within 30 days after notification. ● Urgent symptoms discovered during Study Visit #1 virtual medical evaluation by [CONTACT_597796] (urgent care clinic or emergency room) for medical care. ● Failure to return an ePatch within 45 Days after Visit #1.  We will estimate the proportion who self-report contact [CONTACT_4490] a health care provider within [ADDRESS_790553] any AF events during their patch wear time will be right-censored at the end of their patch wear.  Our objective will be to identify the amount of wear time needed to capture 90% of AF events occurring during the [ADDRESS_790554] the AF-free curve using Kaplan-Meier methods. The time when 90% of AF events have occurred will be estimated from the curve along with a 95% confidence interval calculated using Greenwood’s formula. Device Sensitivity Analysis We will perform an analysis to estimate the sensitivity (i.e. the true positive rate) of the device in detecting irregularities consistent with AF. In the analysis, we will estimate the proportion of participants who have an IPNA positive for an irregular rhythm consistent with AF during the period when they are undergoing simultaneous ambulatory ECG monitoring among participants with AF confirmed by [CONTACT_90660]. These positive IPNA triggers will not result in additional notifications to participant, but will be available for analyses.  Each participant contributes one observation in this analysis. We expect that the device sensitivity may be low. The low sensitivity is expected because tachograms are retrieved only when available from the Apple Watch platform; the Heart Study app does not have the ability to control the collection and storage of tachograms and relies on the platform to do this.  4.[ADDRESS_790555] frequent PACs if they average 30 or more PACs/hour during the ambulatory ECG monitoring.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  Apple Heart Study Version 1.[ADDRESS_790556] frequent PVCs if their (total number of PVCs/total number of beats)*100% is ≥ 5% and very frequent PVCs if ≥ 15% during the ambulatory ECG monitoring. (See the next subsection for criteria used to indicate presence of PACs and PVCs at the tachogram-level.) Intermittent heart block is defined as the presence of p-waves that are not followed by a QRS complex and are not preceded by a gradually prolonging PR interval. No minimum amount of time is required. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is defined as an irregular, narrow complex tachycardia with discernable preceding p-waves preceding the QRS complex that are of at least two different morphologies, lasting at least [ADDRESS_790557] 30 seconds of AF observed on the ambulatory ECG monitor during the tachogram and the 1 minute recorded before and after the tachogram. The participant-level definition described above for sinus arrhythmia, intermittent heart block, multifocal atrial tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia with variable conduction will be applied to the period of ambulatory ECG monitoring during the tachogram and the 1 minute recorded before and after the tachogram. The 1 minute buffer is to ensure that clock drift between the Watch and ECG patch does not invalidate the “simultaneous” nature of the comparison. For frequent PACs, the ambulatory ECG monitoring will be considered to be concordant with a positive tachogram if there are 3 or more PACs observed on the ambulatory ECG monitor during the tachogram and the 1 minute recorded before and after the tachogram. For frequent PVCs, the ambulatory ECG monitoring will be considered to be concordant with a positive tachogram if there are 3 or more PVCs observed on the ambulatory ECG monitor during the tachogram and the 1 minute recorded before and after the tachogram. Very frequent PVCs occur when 9 or more PVCs are observed. Tachogram level concordance will only be estimated for participants who began wearing the ECG patch within 14 days of shipment so that clock drift between the Watch and ECG patch 
Statistical Analysis Plan  Apple Heart Study Version 1.6 9 November 2018 
25 does not exceed the 1 minute buffer described above and invalidate the “simultaneous” nature of the comparison. Notification Level Concordance The ambulatory ECG monitoring will be considered to be concordant with a positive IPNA if [ADDRESS_790558] one hour of analyzable wear time during the simultaneous ECG monitoring will be included in the analyses (EAS). We will use any available tachograms and no data will be considered missing.    Multiple imputation methods will be used in the analyses of patient reported outcomes to account for an expected small proportion of participants who do not complete all questions.  4.[ADDRESS_790559] that some participants will wear their ePatch for a period shorter than 7 days. We acknowledge that several factors may contribute to an overestimated or underestimated proportion of the true AF in participants who receive an irregular pulse notification. We describe above sensitivity analyses to evaluate the sensitivity of our estimate to the minimum wear time for inclusion in the analysis (described in Section 4.3).  In particular, we anticipate several biases that may impact the estimate of the true PPV.   • Patch Wear Bias: We anticipate that not all participants will wear their patches for the full 7 day wear period. We acknowledge that wear periods shorter than 7 days and a study design where the ePatch is worn during a period that follows the initial notification (and not simultaneously) will likely contribute to an underestimated true proportion of AF in participants who receive an IPN because the AF that triggered the initial notification may not be detected during the subsequent ambulatory ECG 
Statistical Analysis Plan  Apple Heart Study Version 1.6 9 November 2018 
26 monitoring. To evaluate the degree that the true proportion may be underestimated, we will compare the proportion of patients with AF as estimated in Objective 1a and 1b (the first primary endpoint below) with the proportion of concordant intervals as estimated in the first secondary endpoint. Furthermore, we will evaluate the sensitivity of our estimates addressing Primary Objectives 1 and 2 to the minimum wear time for inclusion in the analysis (described in Section 4.3).   • Missing Data Bias: For some participants, the IPN will occur but no subsequent analyzable ECG monitoring data will be available (e.g., participant requires urgent care, participant doesn’t return patch).  Because these participants will not provide ambulatory ECG monitoring data, they will not be included in analyses to estimate the proportions in Primary Objectives [ADDRESS_790560] AF and their exclusion would lead to an underestimate. On the other hand, participants who do not return patch may be less sick and their exclusion would result in an overestimate of the proportion of participants with AF. This bias is an inherent limitation of an observational study.  • Observation Period Bias: It is possible that participants may receive an IPN but the subsequent ECG monitoring may not be of sufficient length to observe AF. If this bias is present, we would expect to see the Kaplan-Meier plot in the analysis to determine minimum requirements for wear time of the ePatch continue to increase through the maximum wear time observed (as opposed to a Kaplan-Meier plot that plateaus prior to the maximum wear time observed).  • Spectrum Bias: Varying lengths of watch wearing across participants could lead us to identify more paroxysmal than persistent AF. In a tertiary analysis, we aim to understand the sensitivity of our findings to the definition of AF based on observing at least [ADDRESS_790561] 6 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and 24 hours as alternative definitions.  • Gold Standard Bias: It is possible that an IPN may occur during the simultaneous ambulatory ECG monitoring but the ECG incorrectly indicates no AF is present. We aim to mitigate this bias by [CONTACT_583600]-cleared device and implementing a clinical adjudication process to over-read both the ePatch report and individual tachogram time-point on the raw ECG data.   Analyses performed at the tachogram level assume that the tachograms within the same participant are independent; however, this assumption may be violated because the tachograms are samples from an underlying process. We will evaluate our assumption of independence using the Wald-Wolfowitz run test to evaluate whether the sequence of positive tachograms within participants is longer than expected. If the test indicates that the 
Statistical Analysis Plan  Apple Heart Study Version 1.6 9 November 2018 
27 assumption may be violated (as indicated by a p-value less than 0.05), we will consider alternate methods to account for the non-independence of tachograms, including statistical methods that incorporate the correlation within a participant and a sampling approach to select tachograms that are farther apart in time and hence expected to be less correlated.  5. INTERIM CHECKS A series of interim checks will be performed.   Throughout the course of the study, we will check the number of irregular pulse watch notifications occurring per age subgroup. If a high number of notifications is observed (greater than 10%), enrollment may be paused or throttled downward in any age subgroup (<40, 40-54, 55-64, ≥65), as informed by [CONTACT_597818][INVESTIGATOR_254052]. If the number of notifications observed is less than the study infrastructure capacity, the numbers of participants invited to enroll from the “waiting period” may be increased.

A low rate of ambulatory ECG monitor use would result in an increase in the rates of invitations to enrollment in any age subgroup.

28 2) Percentage of AF noted on ambulatory ECG monitoring is greater than 1%.   A detection of AF less than 1% will prompt a cessation of enrollment in any corresponding age subgroup.   3) Percentage of non-clinically relevant irregular rhythms is greater than 90%. If the vast majority of rhythms detected on ambulatory ECG monitoring are due to other irregular, non-AF arrhythmias, such as sinus arrhythmia, frequent PACs and frequent PVCs, this will prompt a cessation of enrollment in any corresponding age subgroup.

The following will be set as maximum targets for ePatch monitoring.  Exceeding these limits will trigger either a throttling downward or cessation of enrollment:

The Sub-Study is limited to the sub-study participants as of approximately June 22, 2018. This reproducibility plan encompasses all primary and secondary endpoints described in Section 5 of the SSSAP (primary efficacy endpoint, secondary efficacy endpoint, and the primary safety endpoint). The reproduction will include reproducing the sampling of the tachograms. Apple will provide Stanford with the seed used to generate the pseudorandom numbers used to select the sampled tachograms. Stanford will apply the seed to the data provided by [CONTACT_597819]-Study analysis. Apple will provide Stanford with the sampled tachograms used by [CONTACT_597820]-Study analysis for verification.  Next, we will compare 1) the number of tachograms classified as AF according to the spot tachogram algorithm and 2) the number of tachograms classified as AF by [CONTACT_597821]. If both of these counts match, the PPV has been reproduced. If either count does not match, Stanford will share the list of tachograms identified as being AF by [CONTACT_597822]. This process will be repeated for the secondary efficacy endpoint looking at the PPV of the alerts. Next, a 97.5% lower confidence bound will be calculated for the primary efficacy endpoint of spot tachogram-level PPV for AF following the methods outlined in Section 9.3 of the SSSAP. If the lower bound for the spot tachogram-level PPV exceeds 70%, the null hypothesis described in the SSSAP will be rejected. For the PPV of the alerts, a two-sided exact 95% confidence interval will be computed per Section 9.[ADDRESS_790565] with Apple. If any discrepancies are found, the two groups will discuss to identify the discrepancy.  Finally, the number of serious adverse device events (ADEs) and the number and percent of participants experiencing ADEs will be calculated. If any of the counts or the percent do not match, Stanford will share their list of ADEs and participants experiencing ADEs with Apple to identify the source of the discrepancy.  6.[ADDRESS_790566] will repeat the analyses described in the reproducibility plan using the final Apple Heart Study data set. The results of the analyses will be compared with the results based on the adjudicated patches received by [CONTACT_597823] 22, 2018. If discrepancies are found, the results will additionally be displayed separately using data obtained before and after June 22, 2018 to demonstrate the difference between the two time periods. The results will also be compared with the results obtained using the methods described in earlier sections of this SAP. If a discrepancy is observed here, additional investigations will be undertaken to identify the methodological source of the discrepancy between the two approaches. A1.

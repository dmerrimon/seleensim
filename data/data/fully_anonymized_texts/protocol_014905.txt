7 1. Introduction  
1.1 RCC Subtypes and sarcomatoid features:  
The c linical behavior of the 37,000 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
diagnosed annually can vary dramatically (1) and par ameters besides subtype 
are increasingly important (2). The pathologic stage, tumor size, Fuhrman 
nuclear grade, and the presence of tumor necrosis and sarcomatoid features are 
powerful prognostic indicators (3,4,5,6,7,). Sarcomatoid features, defined by 
[CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_404090], can arise in RCC of any type.(8,9) and are present in 
10% of all renal cell carcinomas (8).  Patients with RCC containing sarcomatoid 
features, have a poorer prognosis than patients with non -sarcomatoid -containing 
tumors (median surv ival of 3 -10 months) and usually do not respond to cytokine 
therapy (8,11,12). Furthermore, the extent of sarcomatoid morphology may be 
related to survival, with tumors exhibiting at least 50% sarcomatoid component 
having an especially poor outcome (8).  
1.2 Treatment of RCC with Sarcomatoid features  
There are few published trials focused on RCC with sarcomatoid features. The 
overall benefit of specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404091], retrospective reviews and small pr ospective trials. 
Golshayan A, et al. retrospectively reviewed the Cleveland Clinics’ experience 
with VEGF -targeted therapy in RCC with sarcomatoid features (13). A partial 
response rate of 19% and stable disease rate of 49% was observed in 43 
patients, al l with prior nephrectomy, and good performance status. The median 
progression -free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months and the median overall survival 
(OS) was 11.8 months. The authors concluded that patients who had less than 
20% sarcomatoid features were more likely to respond to VEGF -targeted therapy 
than patients with a higher percentage of these features.   
In fact, RCC with sarcomatoid change appears to be more sensitive than 
conventional RCC to cytotoxic therapy: Building on the work of Nanus (14), we 
cond ucted a phase II trial (E8802) of doxorubicin 50mg/m2 IV push and 
gemcitabine 1500mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks in 39 patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid features in 
the cooperative group setting (15) .There were 6 responses (5 partial response 
[PR] and 1 complete response [CR]), and 9 patients had stable disease (15). In 
addition, a seventh patient had an unconfirmed PR and an eighth patient 
experienced over 50 percent decrease in her tumor burden afte r an initial 
progression. The median overall survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 6.1 – 11.1 
months), which exceeded historical survival data for this population.  
We hope to analyze  whether tumors with a higher percentage of sarcomatoid 
features respond bette r to cytotoxic therapy than those with a lower percentage 
of sarcomatoid features in this recently completed trial.

not been extensively characterized. Increased expression of skp2  was reported

8 in some tumors with sarcomatoid morphology (16). Skp [ADDRESS_509432] (1 6).The myc target genes Mina 53 and Ki67, are 
also overexpressed in some RCC with sarcom atoid  morphology (17,18). 
Increased expression of VEGF, kit, S6 kinase, hypoxia inducible factor [ADDRESS_509433] 
the importance of angiogenesis;(19,20). However, others report lower 
microvessel density in renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid features, as 
compared with  RCC lacking these features, which suggests that standard anti -
angiogenic therapy alone may be less effective;(21) The relationship of these 
molecular phenotypes to morpholo gy and to response are areas of active 
investigation further confounded by [CONTACT_404119] a variety of RCC subtypes.  
Collectively, these findings suggest several lines of  therapeutic investigation for 
renal cell cancers with  sarcomatoid features. The relationship of these molecular 
phenotypes to morphology and to response will be a focus of this work.   
1.4 Rationale for a randomized phase II trial of sunitinib/gemcitabine versus sunitinib  
Some argue that as sarcomatoid change in renal cancer can be present in all 
subtypes of RCC this confounds standard definition. However, this should not 
preclude investigations to better classify and treat this group of patients that 
clearly have a poorer prognosis. No large studies have incorpor ated newer 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404092]. The fact that there was any activity in the E8802 trial of 
doxorubicin/ gemcitabine regimen indicates two things: First, RCC dominated by  
[CONTACT_404120] -sarcomatoid RCC that 
is traditionally chemo -resistant. Second, the exploration of chemotherapy in 
combination with targeted therapy may expand alternatives for these patients. 
Additionally, we will b e gathering useful information about these to potentially 
improve classification and to predict response.  
The combination of doxorubicin and gemcitabine showed encouraging activity 
but was also moderately toxic. Furthermore, a non gemcitabine but doxorubic in 
based trial was inactive (22), and gemcitabine is the cytotoxic agent of greatest 
interest in this disease. Combinations of gemcitabine with sorafenib (23) and 
sunitinib (24) (FDA approved and active in RCC) are feasible without much 
additive toxicity; thus, we have a unique opportunity to characterize these 
combinations in renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid features. A Phase I trial of 
sunitinib /gemcitabine in solid tumors demonstrated tolerability at several doses 
of gemcitabine and sunitinib as we ll as 5 partial responses in 9 patients with 
aggressive RCC (24). A continuation of this trial using a 3 week cycle (2 weeks 
on, 1 week off) of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV (days 1 and 8) in combination with 
sunitinib 37.5 mg (days 1 -14) in RCC with poor risk  features (including 
sarcomatoid features) is ongoing. Another abstract reported 4 disease 
stabilizations and 1 PR in poor risk patients with disease progression on sunitinib 
who had gemcitabine added to their regimens (25).  
These provide a strong argument  for testing the combination of a tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor with gemcitabine in this group of tumors. We propose to evaluate the 
schedule of sunitinib /gemcitabine versus sunitinib in a randomized phase II 
design specific to RCC with sarcomatoid features. The schedule of the sunitinib 
ECOG -ACRIN  E1808  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, 2013  
9 Arm B alone will be 2 weeks on/1 week off repeated for a cycle duration of 6 
weeks, as this schedule is often used for renal cell carcinoma with rapid growth 
and this agent schedule is similar to that of Arm A. In addition to comparing 
activity to the previous doxorubicin/gemcitabine trial, this design will assess if the 
addition of gemcitabine to a VEGF targeted therapy contributes to its activity and 
advances the treatment of this aggressive histology, as well as lend confide nce 
to a decision  for a future Phase III study. Furthermore this design permits 
consideration of predictive (refinement of the characteristics of this poor 
prognosis renal cell patient population) and biologic (association of molecular 
features that predic t therapeutic effect) questions.  
1.5 Hypothesis  
Advancing the treatment of aggressive renal cell carcinomas containing 
sarcomatoid histology depends on two factors: the refinement of the pathologic 
definition of these diseases through molecular analysis and 
immunohistochemical studies and the exploration of new therapeutic strategies 
that may or may not be predicted by [CONTACT_404121]. Given the 
limited reserves of cooperative groups to perform phase II studies in the less 
common diseases, we propose a strategy to juxtapose the biologic and 
therapeutic studies in this trial. The primary endpoint of this trial is to determine 
the response rates to sunitinib/gemcitabine and sunitinib alone. Secondary 
endpoints are as follows: 1. To determine the progression free survival of 
sunitinib/gemcitabine and sunitinib alone. 2. Sample acquisition with central 
pathology review at the ECOG -ACRIN  Central Biorepository and Pathology 
Facility  (CBPF ) and characterization and quantification of the sarcomatoid and  
non-sarcomatoid components of each tumor specimen. Sarcomatoid features are 
hypothesized to be a final aggressive histologic change derived from the original 
tumor and thus a poor prognostic indicator. 3. To bank paraffin blocks from each 
tumor specimen f or future correlative studies. Ultimately these samples will be 
used to assess the relationship of correlates to response rate. An application for 
funding is being submitted for such work to be conducted at the ECOG -ACRIN  
CBPF  and the University of Pennsyl vania.

18 5. Treatment Plan  
Patients will receive sunitinib/gemcitabine (Arm A) or sunitinib alone (Arm B) at the 
schedule outlined below.  Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_404127] < or  50% sarcomatoid features in th e registered pathology . Following 
randomization, central pathology review will be performed to confirm histology and 
percentage sarcomatoid features.  
5.1 Administration Schedule  
Doses of gemcitabine are based on actual (not ideal) body weight. If there is a 
weight change of 10% from baseline, the dose should be recalculated on day 1 
of subsequent cycles using the new weight.   
Treatment  
Arm A  Chemotherapy with gemcitabine and sunitinib malate  
Gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m 2 IV over 30 minutes (days 1, 8, 22 and 29 of  cycle) in 
combination with  
Sunitinib 37.5 mg once daily (days 1 -14 and days 22 -35 of each cycle)  
There will be a one week (7 day) break from sunitinib taking place on days 15 -21 
and an additional one week break on days 36 -42 of each cycle. Each cycle is  42 
days (6 weeks) and should be repeated for a total of one year.  
NOTE:  Sunitinib  should be taken at the same time each day and is best 
tolerated in the evening. Do not make up skipped, missed or vomited 
doses.  
Arm B  Sunitinib malate monotherapy  
Sunitinib  50 mg once daily (days 1 -14 and days 22 -35 of each cycle).  
There will be a one week (7 day) break from sunitinib taking place on days 15 -21 
and an additional one week break on days 36 -42 of each cycle. Each cycle is 42 
days (6 weeks) and should be repeate d for a total of one year.  
NOTE:  Sunitinib  should be taken at the same time each day and is best 
tolerated in the evening. Do not make up skipped, missed or vomited 
doses.  
5.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
5.2.1  Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and rep orting, which are required as 
part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients 
enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies 
using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner 
at schedu led times during a trial (please refer to the E1808 Forms 
Packet for the list of forms with directions for routine adverse event 
reporting).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in 
an expedited manner for more timely monitoring of patient  safety and 
care. The following sections provide information about expedited 
reporting.  Rev. 4/14 Rev. 1/15 
ECOG -ACRIN  E1808  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, 2013  
19 5.2.2  Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) 
whether the patient has received an investigational or comme rcial 
agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade 
(severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and the 
prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the phase 
(1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) wheth er or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253043].  
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but 
obtained instead from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a 
commercial distributor, may on so me occasions distribute commercial 
agents for a trial.  
Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an 
expedited manner:  
Step 1:  Identify the type of event: . The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_509457] access to a  copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
Step 2:  Grade the event using  Version 4.0 of the NCI CTCAE . 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the 
protocol therapy (investigational or commercial).  Attribution 
categories are as fol lows: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, 
Probable, and Definite.  
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  
Expected events are those that have been previously 
identified as resulting from administration of the agent. An 
adverse event is cons idered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the 
severity of the event is NOT listed in:  
• Arm A  and B – the drug package insert or protocol  
Step 5 : Review Section 5.2.6  for E1808 and/or ECOG -ACRIN  
specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring.   
NOTE:   For general  questions regarding expedited reporting 
requirements, please contact [CONTACT_404128]@tech -res.com or 301 -897-7497.  
5.2.3  Reporting Procedure  
This study requires that expedited adverse event reporting use 
CTEP’s Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) . CTEP’s  
guidelines for CTEP -AERS  can be found at http://ctep .cancer.gov .  A 
CTEP -AERS  report must be submitted electronically to ECOG -ACRIN  Rev. 3/12

28 5.4 Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose escalatio n above the original starting dose.  
All toxicities should be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0. A copy of t he CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site  (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
In cases where the dose modifications trigger a toxicity that is known to be 
related to sunitinib, it is not required to modify the dose of gemcitabine. 
Likewise, for toxicities that are known to be related to gemcitabine, but not 
sunitinib, it is not required to modify the dose of sunitinib.

 NCI Update Date: March 14, [ADDRESS_509487] – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluate d for response 
every 12 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also 
be obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective 
response.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] 
(RECIST)  guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009]. Changes in the 
largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the 
shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in RECIST.  
The following general principles must  be followed:  
1. To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline to which subsequent measurements will be compared. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatmen t and never more than four weeks  before registration.  
2. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_202864].  
3. All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by [CONTACT_2363] a ruler or 
calipers.  
4. The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to 
characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_509488] their response classified according to the 
definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response  
Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but 
do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy , and have had their disease re -evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for non -target lesion asse ssment. The 
response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or 
unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
ECOG -ACRIN  E1808  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, [ADDRESS_509489] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as ≥ [ADDRESS_509490] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_509491] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_509492] be 
recorded in millimeters.  
NOTE:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated 
area are not considered measurable.  
Malign ant Lymph Nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_509493] scan (CT 
scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At 
baseline and in follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured and 
followed.  
Non-measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm 
short axis), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone les ions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are  considered as 
non-measurable. Non-measurable also includes lesions that are < [ADDRESS_509494] x -ray. 
NOTE:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically 
defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant 
lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic les ions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of 
measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be 
identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be sel ected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest l esion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.

39 A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for 
nodal lesions) for all targe t lesions will be calculated and reported  as 
the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum of the diameters will be used as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the [ADDRESS_509495] be 
used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline 
and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to 
evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed

Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm 
in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the 
case of skin lesions, documentatio n by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest X -ray 
Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, 
CT is preferable.   
Conventional CT and MRI   
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_509496] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should b e twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, 
spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image 
acquisition variables invol ved in MRI which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the Rev. 3/12  
ECOG -ACRIN  E1808  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, [ADDRESS_509497] 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assess ed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the 
scope of the R ECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse 
sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  
Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as close ly as possible to prior 
scans. Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT 
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for  
use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document 
that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and 
can be used interchangeabl y with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET 
portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an 
investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
Ultrasound  
Ultrasound is not use ful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be us ed as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations 
cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a 
later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that  the same technique and measurements will be taken 
from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by 
[CONTACT_12153], confirmation by C T or MRI is 
advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may 
be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtaine d or to 
determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
6.1.4  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction 
in short axis to < 10 mm.  
ECOG -ACRIN  E1808  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, 2013  
41 Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a  20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an abs olute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression, See Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor su fficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum diameters while on study. (Note: a change of 20% or 
less that does not increase the sum of the diameters by 5 
mm or more is coded as stable disease)  
To be assigned a status of stable  disease, measurements 
must have met the stable disease criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval (not less than six 
weeks for both arms).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all non -target lesions  and normalization 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in size (<  10 mm short axis).  
NOTE:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete clinical resp onse.  
Non-CR/Non -PD 
Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesio ns (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status. It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
ECOG -ACRIN  E1808  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, [ADDRESS_509498] 
“increase” in the size of one or more on -target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status.   The designation of overall progression solely on 
the basis of change in non -target disease in the face of SD 
or PR of ta rget disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the patient only has non -measurable disease, the 
increase in overall disease burden should be comparable 
in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease:   i.e., an  increase in 
tumor burden from “trace” to “large”, an increase in nodal 
disease from “localized” to “widespread”, or an increase 
sufficient to require a change in therapy.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is 
exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_404099], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investigator).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions constitutes Progress ive 
Disease (PD). A growing lymph node that did not meet the 
criteria for reporting as a measurable or non -measurable 
lymph node at baseline should only be reported as a new 
lesion (and therefore progressive disease) if it a) increases 
in size to ≥ 15 mm t he short axis, or b) there is new 
pathological confirmation that it is disease (regardless of 
size).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded 
from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recur rence or non -protocol therapy (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.  Rev. 3/12

** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may 
be accepted as disease progression.  
NOTE :Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objectiv e evidence of disease progression at that time should 
be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
Duration of Response  
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive di sease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
Duration of Stab le Disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
To be assigned a sta tus of stable disease, measurements must have met the 
stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in 
general, not less than six to eight weeks).

8.2.2  Classification  
Antimetabolite (nucleoside pyrimidine analogue)  
8.2.3  Mode of Action  
Gemcitabine exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells 
undergoing DNA synthesis (S phase) and also blocking the 
progression of cells through the G1/S phase boundary. Gemcitabine 
is metabolized intracellularly by [CONTACT_25525] (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. The 
cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine is attributed to a combination of two 
actions of the diphosphate and the triphosphate nucleosides, which 
leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. First, gemcitabine diphosphate 
inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsib le for catalyzing 
the reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphates for 
DNA synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme by [CONTACT_404137] a reduction in the concentrations of 
deoxynucleotides, including dCTP. Second, gemcitabine tri phosphate 
competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The reduction in the Rev. 10/10  
ECOG -ACRIN  E180 8 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, 2013  
49 intracellular concentration of dCTP (by [CONTACT_14193]) 
enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA 
(self-potentiation). After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated 
into DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA 
strands. After this addition, there is inhibition of further DNA synthesis. 
DNA polymerase epsilon is unable to remove the gemcitabine 
nucleotide and repair the  growing DNA strands (masked chain 
termination). In CEM T lymphoblastoid cells, gemcitabine induces 
internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, one of the characteristics of 
programmed cell death.  
8.2.4  Storage and Stability  
Unreconstituted drug vials are stored at cont rolled room temperature 
(15ºC to 30ºC, 59ºF to 86ºF). Reconstituted solution should be stored 
at controlled room temperature and used within 24 hours. Solutions of 
gemcitabine should not be refrigerated; as crystallization may occur. 
The unused portion sho uld be discarded.

 NCI Update Date: March 14, [ADDRESS_509508] 26, 2015. To 
expedite completion of the Suni tinib/Gemcitabine arm, the study was amended to cap 
accrual on that arm at 45 total patients.  Among 33 patients on that arm assessed for 
response at the time of the amendment, the response rate was 21% (90% exact 
binomial confidence interval, 9.0 to 38.9% ). 
Patients will be allocated to treatment with either sunitinib/gemcitabine or sunitinib alone. 
A two -stage design will be used in each arm. During periods when both arms are open, 
the allocation will be by 1:[ADDRESS_509509] assignment. Total 
accrual of 85 patients  is planned, based on expected participation from SWOG and 
CALGB and posting of the study on the CTSU menu.    
9.1 Sample Size and Revised Design for the Sunitinib/Gemcitabine Arm  
While the combination of doxorubicin and gemcitabine showed encouraging 
activity in E8802 (15.4%), a single -agent doxorub icin-based trial was inactive. 
Therefore, it  seems likely that gemcitabine is the active agent. We will consider 
sunitinib to have additive benefit if the true response rate is 30%, while a rate of 
15% will not be of interest.  
First,  23 patients will be enrolled. If 3 or fewer responses are observed , the arm 
will be closed to further accrual. If 4 or more responses are observed, the arm 
will reopen for accrual of 20 additional  eligible, treated  patients. The regimen will 
be declared worthy of further study if 1 0 or more responses are observed. These 
decision rules result in 54% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_404104], 
85% probability of declaring the regimen active given a true response rate of 
30% and 9% probability of declaring the regimen active given a true response 
rate of 15%.  
To assure that 43 eligible patients are assigned to this arm, total accrual of 45 
patients is projected, 25 in stage 1 and 20 in stage 2.  
9.2 Sample Size and Design for the Sunitinib Alone Arm  
A response rate of 20% to sunitinib alone will be of interest, while  further testing 
would not be pursued if the response rate is 5% or lower. Initially, 12 elig ible 
patients will be accrued. If 1 or more responses are observed, then an additional 
25 eligible patients will be accrued. Four or more responses out of 37 eligi ble 
patients will be considered evidence warranting further study of the regimen.  
This design provides 90% probability of declaring the regimen effective if the true 
response rate is 20% and 9% probability of declaring the regimen effective if  the 
true re sponse rate is 5%. The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_404105] 54%.  
To assure that 37 eligible patients are assigned to this arm, total accrual of 40 
patients (13 in stage 1 and 27 in stage 2) is projected.   Rev. 11/15

one-sided Type I error of 10%.  Full information will exist when [ADDRESS_509513], there will be 80% power to 
demonstrate 50% improvement, with one -sided Type I error of 10%.  Full

As both arms are experimental, a statistical comparison of  PFS on the two arms 
of this study is not planned.  In the absence of a statistically significant 
improvement in response rates of the sunitinib/gemcitabine combination or 
sunitinib alone over the null rates, decisions about whether to carry forward one 
of these regimens or the prior ECOG  8802 (doxorubicin/gemcitabine) regimen 
into Phase III testing (or, if Phase III testing is deemed infeasible in this limited 
subset, recommendations about treatment for these patients) will be based on a 
global evaluation of toxicity, response, PFS, and overall survival.  Analysis of 
overall survival will be descriptive, using Kaplan -Meier survival estimates, and 
will be conducted separately for each arm.

will be included in the safety analysis population. Safety will be evaluated 
separately on t he two arms.  If 45 patients are treated with the combination of 
gemcitabine/sunitinib, the maximum width of a 90% confidence interval on the  
rate of severe toxicity will be no wider than 2 6% (+/ - 13%). The probability of 
observing at least one rare toxicity (true rate of 5%) is approximately 9 0%.  If 40

confidence int erval on the rate of severe toxicity will be no wider than 28% (+/ - 
14%). The probability of observing at least one rare toxicity (true rate of 5%) is 
approximately 87%.  
Interim analyses of toxicity are performed twice yearly for all ECOG -ACRIN

Tumor tissue blocks and slides will be processed and the appropriate diagnostic 
materials, including the pathology reports, will be forwarded  to [CONTACT_94116][INVESTIGATOR_404109].  
From patients who have consented to allow the retention of specimens for 
research, the tissue will be processed to maximize  the utility of the specimens. 
Processing may include, but not be limited to, the const ruction of TMAs and the 
extraction of DNA, RNA, and proteins.  
10.4 Histologic Confirmation    
Histologic subtype is a strong prognostic indicator, as well as a determinant of 
response to therapy (2,3,4). The following pathological parameters (beyond TNM 
assig nment) have been demonstrated to have prognostic rele vance in renal cell 
carcinoma. As such, uniform documentation of these parameters is essential in 
any study measuring outcomes.  
1. RCC Subtypes:   The [ADDRESS_509520], and renal cell carcinoma, unclassified.  Rev. 3/13  
Rev. 1/15 Rev. 1/15 
Rev. 1/15 
Rev. 1/15 
ECOG -ACRIN  E180 8 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, 2013  
56 Increasingly, rarer subtypes, such as renal  medullary carcinoma, 
translocation carcinomas (Xp11.2/TFE3 fusions, for example), mucinous 
tubular and spi[INVESTIGATOR_404110], multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, 
mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_404111].  Each 
of these common and rarer subtypes have characteristic molecular genetic 
abnormalities, which in turn correlate with biological behavior and likely 
correlate with response to adjuvant therapy.  While subclassification based 
upon rigorous application of histopatholo gical criteria is usually straight -
forward, a significant subset of cases are problematic for the pathologist.  For 
example, the occasional tumor with eosinophilic features may be 
misclassified as eosinophilic variant of clear cell carcinoma, papi[INVESTIGATOR_347498] (type 2), eosinophilic variant of chromophobe carcinoma, benign 
oncocytoma, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_404112]. The correct subclassification is 
not only critical from a molecular -genetic standpoint, but also from a 
prognostic standpoint as several studi es have demonstrated the prognostic 
significance of the tumor subtype (5,6,7).  
2. Sarcomatoid component:   The 2004 WHO classification discarded the term 
“sarcomatoid carcinoma” in favor of the term “[subtype] with sarcomatoid 
change” recognizing that most renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid 
elements have associated, conventional (clear cell, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], or chromphobe) 
subtypes.  Those tumors that lack a conventional subtype are categorized as 
RCC, unclassified.  Several studies have shown that presence of  
sarcomatoid change is associated with a bad prognosis (8, 9). It is currently 
accepted that the presence of any sarcomatoid component portends a bad 
prognosis; however, the significance of the histopathological features of the 
sarcomatoid component or the  relative amount of the sarcomatoid component 
has not been rigorously analyzed.  
3. Fuhrman Grade:  The Fuhrman  system is the most widely used nuclear 
grading system for renal cell car cinoma of clear cell histology.  The Fuhrman  
nuclear grade is widely accep ted as a si gnificant prognostic variable. 
Although the criteria for grades 1 to 4 are fairly rigidly defined, its 
reproducibility between pathologists appears to be low, with studies showing 
Kappa values ranging from 0.19 to 0.44, reflecting only poor to m oderate 
reproducibility (27,28,29).  In addition, the applicability of the Fuhrman 
grading sytem may vary between the subtypes. Specifically, a four -tiered 
system (Fuhrman grades 1, 2, 3 and 4) correlates with prognosis in clear cell 
tumors, a two -tiered s ystem (“low -grade” [combining Fuhrman grades 1 and 
2] and “high -grade” [combining Fuhrman grades 3 and 4] better stratifies 
prognosis of papi[INVESTIGATOR_219], and Fuhrman grading probably does not 
prognostically stratify chromophobe tumors.  Finally, renal cel l carcinomas 
are often heterogeneous containing areas of tumor with more than one 
Fuhrman grade.  By [CONTACT_559], the tumor is graded based upon the highest 
Fuhrman grade present; however, this approach has not been seriously 
validated; a tumor with a small  focus of Fuhrman grade [ADDRESS_509521] as badly as a tumor with mostly Fuhrman grade 4 - yet both would be 
classified as grade 4.  
4. Necrosis :  The presence of coagulative tumor necrosis has recently been 
shown to be an adverse prognostic va riable (30).  Similar to the presence of a 
ECOG -ACRIN  E180 8 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 22, 2016  
 NCI Update Date: March 14, 2013  
57 sarcomatoid component, the amount of coagulative necrosis may also show 
prognostic significance.  
5. TNM :  Accurate assignment of TNM status is important in renal cell 
carcinoma.  As such, tumor size, extension bey ond the renal capsule 
(perinephric fat, Gerota fascia, adrenal, other), renal vein (or vena cava) 
invasion, renal sinus involvement, and lymph node (hilar, periaortic, distant, 
etc) involvement (if sampled by [CONTACT_404139]) must be 
documented in a uniform manner via Central Pathology Review.  
10.5 ECOG -ACRIN  Sample Tracking System  
It is required  that all samples submitted on this trial be entered and tracked 
using the ECOG -ACRIN  Sample Tracking System (STS). The software will allow

Patient Thank You Letter  
We ask that the physician use the template contained in this appendix to prepare a letter 
thanking the patient for enroll ing in this trial. The template is intended as a guide and can be 
downloaded from the ECOG web site at http://www.ecog.org . As this is a personal letter, 
physicians may elect to further tailor the text to their situatio n. 
This small gesture is a part of a broader program being undertaken by [CONTACT_1345] -ACRIN  and the 
NCI to increase awareness of the importance of clinical trials and improve accrual and follow -
through. We appreciate your help in this effort.

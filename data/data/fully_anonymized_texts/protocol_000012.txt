[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 [ADDRESS_950761] that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate 
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.  
1.1 Title 
Effects of Mometasone Furoate/Formoterol Combination Versus Mometasone Furoate Alone Versus Formoterol alone in Persistent Asthmatics (Study P04334AM1; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To assess the effects of 26 weeks of treatment with mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) compared with formoterol (F) 
alone on the incidence of time to first asthma deterioration in patients with persistent asthma previously receiving medium-
dose inhaled corticosteroids.  
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
Asthma exacerbation defined by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_700414] (i.e., systemic   
corticosteroids)  
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
This trial is a superiority trial. For time to first asthma deterioration, assuming a 5% event rate for MF/F 200/10 ug and an 
18% event rate for F 10 ug, the trial’s sample size will provide ~90% power to detect a treatment difference in survival 
curves.  
1.5 Trial estimate 
The proportion of patients experiencing asthma deteriorations was MF/F, 30.4%, MF, 33.9%, F 54% (p <0.001).  (Nathan et 
al., 2010).  The calculated risk ratio is 0.90 (95% CI, 0.67-1.20) for MF/F vs MF and 0.56 (95% CI 0.44, 0.72) for MF/F vs 
F.

5. Cohort Identification  
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort design comparing mometasone-
furoate/formoterol 200/10ug with formoterol [ADDRESS_950762] continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 days before initiation 
of mometasone-furoate/formoterol or formoterol. (Note: the formoterol dose used in the trial was 10ug ; in the replication, we will use the market available dose which is 12 ug).  
 5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
New use of mometasone-furoate/formoterol 200/10ug (exposure) is defined as no use of the exposure drug with in the 180 days 
prior to index date. New use of formoterol 12 ug (comparator) is defined as no use of the comparator drug with in the 180 days 
prior to index date. New users of mometasone-furoate/formoterol 200/10ug are not allowed to receive formoterol 12 ug with in the 
180 days prior to index date, and new users of formoterol 12 ug are not allowed to receive mometasone-furoate/formoterol 
200/10ug within the 180 prior to index date. 
 
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates 
Mometasone-furoate/formoterol was approved by [CONTACT_700418] 24, [ADDRESS_950763] date after June 24, 2010 for both the databases investigated (IBM® MarketScan®, 
Optum CDM). The last date eligible as cohort entry date was the end of available data for IBM® MarketScan® and Optum 
CDM. The following eligible cohort entry dates were included: 
• Optum CDM: June 24, 2010 – June 30, 2020 (end of available data) 
• IBM® MarketScan®: June 24, 2010– December 31, 2018 (end of available data)   
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion criteria for cohort entry and define the index date 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are 
provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

 5 6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure-related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
New initiation of MF/F  (200/10 ug twice daily). New initiation is defined as no use of MF/F in the prior 180 days before treatment 
initiation (washout period). New users of MF/F  are not allowed to receive F within the 180 days prior to treatment initiation. 
 Comparator agent: 
New initiation of F (12 ug weekly). F 12ug is the market available dose form of formoterol that was selected for formoterol 10 ug used 
in the trial. New initiation is defined as no use of F in the prior 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period). New users of F 
are not allowed to receive MF/F 200/10 ug within the 180 days prior to treatment initiation. 
 
6.2 Preliminary Covariates: 
• Age 
• Gender 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to and including index date. 
 Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. 
We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between 
treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility 
analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  
 6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_950764] (definitions provided in Appendix A): 
§ Primary outcome: Time to first asthma exacerbation  (algorithm adapted from Nathan, et. al, and Fuhlbrigge A, et. al.,)  
 
6.3.2 Study follow-up 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 6 Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of 
cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment. 
For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of MF/F and F and will continue until the earliest date of the 
following events: 
 
§ The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, 
§ The date of end of continuous registration in the database, 
§ Discontinuation of the index drugs, 
§ End of the study period, 
§ Measured death event occurs, 
§ Nursing home admission 
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typi[INVESTIGATOR_126081] a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for 
cohorts for the same reason. 
• The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_8372] (MF/F and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., [ADDRESS_950765] prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses). 
• The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa  
§ A dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion

In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90-day gap in database enrollment will be used. This outcome 
is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. Complete a 1:1 
PS-matched comparative analysis using this outcome. PS should include only 3 covariates: age, gender, and combined comorbidity 
index. Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008). 
 
• Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by [CONTACT_8414]. Reviewers evaluate the results of the 
analyses described above in Sections 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow-up time, and reasons 
for censoring by [CONTACT_1570], as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power. These parameters are re-evaluated and 
reported in the subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol.  
 
• Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by [CONTACT_61337], FDA, and assigned members of advisory board.

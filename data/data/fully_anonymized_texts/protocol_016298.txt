2 BACKG
 ROUND AND RATIONALE   
 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Within organ transplant, despi[INVESTIGATOR_165409], long-
term graft survival has not improved to nearly the same degree.  In kidney transplant, since 2003, there has been a 50% reduction in acute rejection rates; yet, during this 
same period of time, the allograft half -life has only increased by a modest 0.[ADDRESS_729897] r ecent report from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (SRTR) 
demonstrates a historically low one- year acute rejection rate of 10%, with a suboptimal 
five-year graft survival rate of 70%.4  Drug -related problems, which encompass 
medication errors, non -adherence and adverse drug events, are a predominant cause 
of deleterious clinical outcomes in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; most notably, graft loss.
[ADDRESS_729898] one 
medication error.11-13  Of more concern, nearly one in eight kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555895] a medication error which directly contributes to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555896].  These medication errors are usually the result of unintentional non-a dherence: patients have difficulty obtaining medications, gets confused from the 
fragmented care they receive or forget to take medications in a timely manner.
14  Non-
adherence has now been recognized as a major contributor to late acute antibody mediated rejection (AMR), the development of donor specific antibodies (DSA) and subsequent graft loss.  In a landmark study by [CONTACT_555931], [ADDRESS_729899] -trans plant; 47% of the 50 allografts 
that failed during this time were due to AMR; 32% of patients were identified as non-
adherent and one- half of all AMRs were due to this.  Remarkably, medication non-
adherence was 10 times more frequent in patients with graft  failure (32% vs. 3%, 
p<0.001).
[ADDRESS_729900] -
transplant events.  A study by [CONTACT_555932] 149 medication errors identified in 93 ambulatory organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 44% were due to iatrogenic causes, including 13% from a prescribing error and 13% from a dispensing error.  Importantly, 26% of these errors led to clinical significant events, including 
 8  laboratory abnormalities (8%), physical issues (5%), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (8%) and an 
outpatient intervention (8%).  Thus, to improve medication safety, interventions should not only focus on the patient, but also engage the health care providers.
[ADDRESS_729901] surpassed rejections as the leading cause of graft loss.
9  Our prev ious research demonstrates that 
immunosuppressant adverse drug events are associated with medication errors; patients that experience medication errors leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165413] 2.[ADDRESS_729902] three adverse drug events (p=0.020).
[ADDRESS_729903] the unique education and training to both identify these events early, while also developi[INVESTIGATOR_165415].
16,17,27- 31  
Also of concern with the use of chronic immunosuppression therapy in the ambulatory care setting are drug interactions.  The calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, which are widely utilized immunosuppressants, are metabolized through the cytochrome P450 3A4/[ADDRESS_729904] of drug- related problems leading to graft loss 
on clinical and economic outcomes cannot be overstated.  Annual death rates are more than three times higher in those with kidney allograft failure (9.4%), as compared to those with a functioning transplant (2.8%).
[ADDRESS_729905] -effective.  
However, due to high and varied peri -operative costs associated with this surgery, the 
break -even point can range from two to 11 ye ars after transplant.38,39  Once a kidney 
transplant fails, patients return to dialysis and costs to provide care accrue at a significantly higher rate.
40,41  Our research indicates that kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555897], costing more than $18,000 per case.
14  These data, taken in 
its entirety, establishes the need for innovative interventions designed to improve medication safety and reduce drug- related problems in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], by 
[CONTACT_555933], non- adherence and adverse drug events;
[ADDRESS_729906] -led interventions can improve outcomes in transplant patients.  The specific 
rationale for this study are based on the following:  
 
Medication Safety Issues in Transplantation:  
• Medication safety events are common in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  In an analysis we 
conducted of 200 prospectively monitored transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], significant medication errors occurred in 64% of patients, with immunosuppressants associated with the error 48% of the time.  Patient -related issues (taking the wrong 
dose prescri bed or missing doses) caused 68% of these errors, with provider and 
systems issues accounting for the remaining third.  Significant adverse drug events, defined as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher, occurred a tot al of 327 times and within 87% of the study cohort.  
Patients that experienced a significant medication error contributing to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555898] (2.1±1.0 vs. 1.6±1.1, p=0.030).
14 
• Previous research has demonstrated that transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555899], including: taking >10 medications concomitantly with more than 30 doses ingested per day, being prescribed narrow therapeutic index medications that are prone to drug interactions, taking chronic immunosuppressants with known debilitating side effects and having frequent dosage adjustments that occur during distantly, over the phone, during chart reviews.  Additionally, long- term ambulatory transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555900]; thus fragmented care, omissions, duplications and discrepancies in medication regimens are common within these patients.  We have also established this as a major issue facing Veteran transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
3,10- [ADDRESS_729907] -Led Interventions to Improve Medication Safety in Transplantation:  
• Previous studies demonstrate that interdisciplinary quality improvement endeavors, 
which include the empowerment of pharmacists to implement initiatives aimed at improving medication use, can substantially improve medication safety in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555901].  This data demonstrated a 40% reduction in adverse drug events leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 14% reduction in length of stay >3 days and 50% reduction in 14- day readmissions.  Our follow -up 
study, which measured the impact of a pharmacist -led formal medication 
reconciliation initiative, demonstrated that, on average, 2.3 medication errors per 
 10  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555902] (3.4 vs. 1.1, p<0.001, respectively); 
although, medication errors were still apparent in a significant number of discharges, establishing the need of pharmacist involvement in the ambulatory phase of care for these high- risk patients.
16,17 
 
Medicati on Safety in Veteran Transplants:  
• Veteran transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555903] -facility 
systems of care, such that medication safety monitoring and care coordination in 
the ambulatory care setting is often fragmented and suboptimal.  Our previous research has demonstrated that nearly two- thirds of Veteran transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555904] -users; with 62% having multiple providers managing the same conditions.  
This leads to a significant number of duplications and omissions in care.  Medication discrepancies between systems are nearly universal as well.  Thus, provider and system -level issues represent substantial reinforcing and enabling 
factors driving medication safety events in Veteran transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
3    
• We completed an interrupted time series analysis, demonstrating significantly improved adherence to appropriate immunosuppression laboratory monitoring by [CONTACT_2329] a population surveillance dashboard to identify Veteran transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555905], allowing the pharmacist to efficiently intervene by [CONTACT_555934]- VA care.  Using 
segmented regression, we demonstrated a 38% improvement in monitoring (p<0.001), at a rate of 4.7% improvement per month for the fir st six months of the 
intervention (p<0.001).
[ADDRESS_729908] syste m 
is currently being utilized at multiple sites (one in VISN 7 and several in VISN 12). For this proposal, we plan to expand the dashboards functionality and incorporate its use by [CONTACT_555935] [ADDRESS_729909] system that monitors and reports on potential immunosuppression- related safety issues.  The study 
will use prospective methodology to monitor patients for 24- months following site-
randomization, comparing outcomes between the intervention and control sites.  Clinical outcomes that will be assessed include health care encounters (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510727]), estimated health care costs, and graft and patient survival.  The functionality of the dashboard system will also be assessed by [CONTACT_555936] s, proportion of 
alarming lab values without follow up scheduled, estimated immunosuppression adherence (using the proportion of days covered [PDC] ), proportion of significant drug 
interactions without an immunosuppressant level and the proportion of hospi [INVESTIGATOR_555906].  
The study population will consist of veteran organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555907].  Organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555908] -9/[ADDRESS_729910].  Once 
identified, active medications will be queried and those receiving immunosuppressant medications to prevent rejection (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate, sirolimus, everolimus, or belatacept) will be included in the study.  
The study will take place at [ADDRESS_729911] system, which is updated at approximately 7:[ADDRESS_729912] operating procedure (SOP) manual that the 
pharmacists will be trained on prior to study initiation .  Once the pharmacist validates 
that the dashboard alert is a relevant issue, they will develop a management plan using 
these protocols (Figure above), discuss the recommendations with the providers (when necessary), agree on a plan, and implement the plan.  The primary medication safety 
issues the intervention pharmacists will be alerted to,  and address are laboratory 
abnormalities, medication non- adherence, drug interactions and medication 
coordination/communication issues.  For laboratory abnormali ties, common issues 
encountered within transplant patients include electrolyte irregularities, organ dysfunction, drug level outliers and cytopenias.  For each of the laboratory values that will be monitored  and reported in the dashboard, a detailed algorithm in the standard 
operating procedures (SOP) manual  delineating how to address the issues will be used 
for the pharmacist -led intervention.  For instance, it is well known that magnesium levels 
are low in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555909] a side effect of calcineurin inhibitors.
[ADDRESS_729913] of these through changing of regimens (when appropriate), educating patients and/or providers and increased monitoring and surveillance.
[ADDRESS_729914] will ensure accurate and safe medication regimens through medication reconciliation and improved medication safety surveillance through the scheduling and follow up of laboratory assessments.
17  To ensure fidelity across sites and efficiency for 
providers, the specific day -to-day tasks involved with this intervention, which include 
assessing and intervening on the alerts and appropriate follow up with patient and 
providers, will be delivered using the SOP manual .15-17   
 
4 S ELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF STUDY SITES AND PATIENTS  
Patients will be included in this study if they are veteran organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555910].  Organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555908] -9/[ADDRESS_729915] 
(CPRS) , with this data housed in the CDW .  Once identified, active medications wi ll be 
queried and those receiving immunosuppressant medications to prevent rejection (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate, sirolimus, everolimus, or belatacept) will be included in the study.   There are no exclusion criteria for patients in 
this study as recruitment is at the VA site- level.   As this is a cluster -randomized study 
and randomization will occur at the site level and not the patient -level, participants will 
not be recruited for the  study, and data collection will occur through querying and linking 
the VA CDW, the SRTR transplant registry and CMS data repositories.  We will request 
waiver of written documentation of patient informed consent . We will also request 
HIPAA authorization waiver as well for all patients .  The following protected health 
information (PHI) elements will be required to complete the study with the HIPAA authorization waiver.

4.1 Inclusion Criteria (require both to be included)  
• Veteran organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555908] -9/[ADDRESS_729916] (CPRS).  Patients must have an active code 
stating they are a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_176362].  The following codes will be utilized:  
o ICD-9 codes:  V42.0, V42.1, V42.6, V42.7, V42.83, V42.84, 996.81 , 
996.82,  996.83 , 996.84 , 996.86, 52.80

 AND
  
 
• Actively receiving at least one anti -rejection medication dispensed by [CONTACT_555937].  
These medications include tacrolimus, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate, sirolimus, everolimus, and belatacept.  
 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
• There are no exclusion criteria for patients in this study as recruitment is at the level of the VA site. 
• All veterans meeting inclusion criteria will be monitored by [CONTACT_555938].  Patients may enter or exit the study in a rollin g manner, which will be accounted for during analyses.  
 
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Once IRB approval is obtained (via central IRB), each potential participating pharmacist will undergo informed written consent.  Following this, each site will be randomiz ed to 
 [ADDRESS_729917] -led intervention.  To ensure a 
roughly equal number  of patients between  the two comparison groups, randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_555939][INVESTIGATOR_840] (<125 versus ≥125 
active patients).  After randomization, each participating pharmacist  will be informed of 
their assigned group.  Those in the intervention arm will be trained on the dashboard system, utilizing the dashboard,  and delivering the intervention.   Those in the usual care 
group will continue to provide the same level of care they are currently providing as part of their normal day -to-day activities and job functions.  
If a site or participating pharmacist withdraws prior to study initiation, if possible, it will be replaced with a suitable alternative site /pharmacist .  If a site pharmacist withdraws 
after initiation, the investigational team will determine if the site needs to be replaced.  This will depend on how far along the intervention is and the number of veterans impacted by [CONTACT_555940].  
Because this is a cluster -randomized trial, and randomization occurs at the site level, 
we will not recruit, consent,  or enroll at the subject level.  We will request waiver of 
written documentation of patient informed cons ent. We request waiver of HIPAA for all 
patients.   
 
[ADDRESS_729918] of 
care procedures within their sites (described below), while also utilizing the dashboard system daily to identify Veteran transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555911].  Each day, the pharmacists will open the dashboard system, which is updated each morning.  The system will identify new patient -specific alerts that will inform the 
pharmacist on potential medication safety issues.  The pharmacist  will then serve as a 
patient navigator, intervening to resolve the medication safety issue, by [CONTACT_555941].  Once the pharmacist validates that the dashboard alert is a relevant issue, they will develop a management plan using these protocols, discuss the recommendations with the providers (when necessary), agree on a plan, and implement the plan.   
The four primary medication safety issues the intervention pharmacists will be alerted to 
and address are laboratory abnormalities, medication non- adherence, drug interactions 
and medication coordination/communication issues.  For laboratory abnormalities, 
common issues encountered within transplant patients include electrolyte irregularities, organ dysfunction, drug level outliers and cytopenias.  For each of the laboratory values that will be monitored and reported in the dashboard, a detailed algorithm will be provided delineating how to address the issue, within the SOP manual  (see below) .  As 
one example, it is well known that magnesium levels are low in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555909] a side effect of calcineurin inhibitors.
[ADDRESS_729919] of these through changing of regimens (when appropriate), educating patients and/or providers and increased monitoring and surveillance.
[ADDRESS_729920], with appropriate training.  
  
 17     
 
5.2 Training for  Study Interventions  
Prior to the initiation of the study, the pharmacists randomized to the intervention will 
participate in a two- day training conference held at the coordinating site.  During this 
training, the dashboards functionality will be reviewed, along with the SOP manual 
which fully guides interventions.  During this training conference, the intervention 
pharmacists will also participate in case -based competencies.    
 

 18  Sessions that occur during this conference include:   
1. General overview of organ transplantation  
2. Review of immunosuppression pharmacology and pharmacokinetics  
3. Review of transplant immunosuppression dashboard specifics  
4. Running reports  to create alert s 
5. Assessing clinical relevance of alerts  
6. Alert categories  
7. Interventions to address alerts  
8. Suppressing alerts  
9. Clinical and research documentation  
10. Motivational interviewing techniques – face-to-face and over the phone  
11. Provider collaboration strategies  
12. Case- reviews    
 
The investigational team and outside consultant experts will lead these sessions.  We 
will also utilize expertise from the local VA and transplant center to conduct training 
sessions when needed.    In addition, during the 24- month intervention period, we will 
have monthly teleconferences with the intervention pharmacists at the five sites to discuss and address issues with the dashboard and/or intervention.  As an additional safety measure and to further ensure intervention fidelity, we will have experts available to discuss patient issues with sites participating in the intervention.  These include the PI, transplant nephrology, transplant hepatology and an internal medicine physician.  All interventions will be documented in the medical record using an approved note 
template . As another quality assurance step, through querying the notes  entered into 
CPRS by [CONTACT_555942], we will capture specific interventions made by [CONTACT_555943]; these will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_555912].  If there are concerns with speci fic interventions made 
by [CONTACT_555944], these will be addressed on a case- by-case basis.  During the 
course of the study, if an intervention pharmacist has a particular issue that is time sensitive and is unsure how to address it, they will have the ability to call and/or page the PI [INVESTIGATOR_555913], which includes expertise in transplant -related care.  For 
non-urgent issues, pharmacists can send secure emails to investigational team 
members or bring up the issue during conference calls.  Thus, there will be ample training and resources available to all intervention site pharmacists to ensure the study is conducted in a safe clinically appropriate manner with strong fidelity.  
 
  
 [ADDRESS_729921] -led intervention. 
Usual care for Veteran organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555914] 10 study sites varies 
somewhat, but generally includes the following:  at most sites, nurse coordinators and/or mid- level practitioners are responsible for general transplant patient oversight, 
including ensuring laboratory assessm ents are scheduled/reviewed and medication 
regimens are accurate and up to date.  However, large patient numbers and workload constraints preclude these health care professionals  from prospective detailed daily 
monitoring of patients.  If there is non- adherence to laboratory assessments or 
medications, they are rarely identified concurrently or early after they occur.  Thus, medication safety issues that arise usually do not get identified or addressed until they have caused a clinically significant issue, leading to a health care encounter (clinic visit, 
ER visit, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  In addition, during this long- term ambulatory phase of care for 
transplant patients, pharmacists usually act as consultants and are only involved in 
direct patient care if an is sue arises, and the nurse or provider engages the pharmacist 
for assistance.  Within usual follow up care, pharmacists do not conduct routine daily 
surveillance of all transplant patients.  Most transplant patients have multiple physician 
providers, both within and outside the VA system, providing care and medication management.  This includes a primary care physician to manage common comorbidities 
(hypertension, diabetes, etc.) and a specialist (nephrology, hepatology) to manage 
allograft function; other specialists, including endocrinologists and cardiologists, are 
commonly involved with this patient population as well.  Thus, care coordination and 
communication across these providers and health care organizations can often be 
fragmented.  This usual care environment is complex and difficult to navigate, even for 
patients with high health literacy.
3,[ADDRESS_729922] using approved note templates, including a specific transplant medication 
monitoring note which has already been developed and is in use by [CONTACT_555945] 7 and VISN 12.  Through querying the notes entered into CPRS by [CONTACT_52886] 
 20  site pharmacists, we will capture specific interventions made by [CONTACT_555946]; these will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_555912].  This is particularly the case for interventions involving changes in immunosuppression regimens. If there are concerns with specific interventions made by [CONTACT_555944], these will be addressed on a case- by-case basis.  During the 
course of the study, if an intervention pharmacist has a particular issue that is time 
sensitive and is unsure how to address it, they will have the ability to call and/or page the PI [INVESTIGATOR_555913], which includes expertise in transplant -related care.  For 
non-urgent issues, pharmacists can send secure emails to investigational team 
members or bring up the issue during conference calls.   
Adherence to the intervention and the SOP manual will be monitored by [CONTACT_555947].  Specific interventions will be reviewed in a concurrent fashion.  All deviations or issues that are identified will be reviewed by [CONTACT_555948].  If a concerning pattern of non- adherence develops at a particular study site, 
the PI, in conjunction with the Co- Is and data safety monitoring team as the right to 
remove that site from the study.  Replacement of a site will depend on criteria discussed in the study enrollment procedures section of this protocol.

UDY PROCEDURES  
Because of the nature of this intervention, all care that is provided, including laboratory 
and clinic visits, will be considered as usual care.  The intervention consists of increased review of patients by a pharmacists and increased scrutiny of patients’ medication regimens and laboratory values, through the use of a dashboard surveillance system.  However, any interventions that are made as a result of this increased review will be considered usual care as they are directly related to monitoring of the organ transplant and immunosuppression medications.  Thus, there are no study procedures that will occur above and beyond usual care procedures, which are described in the usual care section of this protocol.  
 
The procedures unique to this study includes  randomization of sites to use of the 
dashboard (intervention) or usual patient care review,  training of the five intervention 
site pharmacists, site initiation and monitoring of intervention integrity and fidelity during 
the 24- month intervention phase of the study.  No patient -specific procedures or 
interventions will occur that are above and beyond usual care will occur as part of this study. 
 [ADDRESS_729923] of study interventions on patient outcomes will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_555949] (IOC) . The IOC will consist of the PI, co -investigators, 
study coordinator, data manager and consultants on the proposal. The functions of the 
IOC will include: 1) providing scientific oversight; 2) reviewing all serious adverse events 
(graft loss and death events, compared across intervention groups) or complications related to the study; 3) monitoring site adherence to the intervention; 4) reviewing 
 21  summary reports relating to compliance with research protocol requirements; and 5) 
providing advice on resource allocation. The IOC will meet bi- annually and as 
necessary by [CONTACT_756]. The recommendations of the IOC  will be reviewed and the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_555915]. As part of this oversight, we will also recruit an independent transplant nephrologist that is not affiliated with this study to provide their expertise and review of all study activities. This expert will conduct the 
following:  
1) Review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring.  
2) Evaluate the progress of the intervention, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, site enrollment and retention, participant risk versus benefit, integrity of the intervention, and other factors that can affect study outcome.  
3) Consider factors external to the study when interpreting the data, such as scientific or clinical developments that may impact the safety of study participants 
or the ethics of the study.  
4) Make recommendations to the IOC , IRB, and VA R&D/VA HSR&D for 
continuation or termination of the study.  
5) Protect the confidentiality of study data and monitoring.  
The independent transplant nephrologist will have the authority to discontinue the trial 
temporarily or permanently  if they perceive that harm is occurring due to the 
intervention. They will meet with the IOC to review serious adverse event reports, 
patient complaints if any, and site issues. Data will be provided at these meetings on key variables that may indicate harm, including, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits, graft loss and death. The IOC  biostatistician will evaluate the confidentiality and integrity of the 
database and the procedures for recording and storing confidential files. The independent transplant nephrologist will also review the elements of the plan to manage emergencies.  
 
7.1 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
The intervention for this trial does not involve the administration of medications or 
investigational agents, but rather supplemental pharmacist -led care provided in addition 
to usual care already delivered to veteran organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Thus, the intervention is considered minimal risk research.  As part of this study, SAEs will be monitored, compared between the intervention and usual care group and reported to the IOC and independent transplant nephrologist on a bi -annual basis.   
SAEs are defined as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits, graft loss and death.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555916].  
Graft loss events will be obtained from SRTR data linked to the VA data, while death will 
be obtained from both SRTR and VA CDW data. Due to the minimal risk of this study 
intervention and the fact that the intervention does not involve the admini stration of 
investigational agents, adverse events, including abnormalities in laboratory values, new syndromes or diseases or new or worsening patient symptoms will not be monitored or reported as a part of this study.  These will be monitored and address ed 
under normal usual care provided to the veteran at the study sites.  
 [ADDRESS_729924] the following:  
1) Review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring.  
2) Evaluate the progress of the intervention, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, site enrollment and retention, participant risk versus benefit, integrity of the intervention, and other factors that can affect study outcome.  
3) Consider factors external to the study when interpreting the data, such as scientific or clinical developments that may impact the safety of study participants or the ethics of the study.  
4) Make recommendations to the internal IOC, IRB, and VA R&D/VA HSR&D for 
continuation or termination of the study.  
5) Protect the confidentiality of study data and monitoring.  
 
8 I
NTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
The intervention will be discontinued based on the recommendations of the IOC  and/or 
the expert transplant nephrologist opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  These decisions will be based on bi -annual 
reports provided by [CONTACT_555950].  Discontinuation will be recommended 
if the intervention demonstrates increased harm or potential harm to veterans at sites randomized to the intervention.  This decision will be made based on clinically or statistically significant differences that are apparent in SAE rates between intervention 
and usual care sites.  Worrisome trends will also be considered in the IOC  decision.  
The study sample size and power analyses were not designed to specifically conduct interim analyses for outcomes and factor in early termination due to substantial improvements or futility.  Thus, only safety concerns will be used as criteria for early stoppage.  
If a particular site discontinues the intervention or usual care, attempts will be made to replace the site if possible.  However, if the site discontinues the study after considerable intervention time has elapsed, data collection for follow up outcomes will be locked at that time point and a replacement site will not be recruited.  
 
[ADDRESS_729925] : 
1. Veterans in the intervention group will have significantly lower rates of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306134], as compared to the control group, at the end of the 24- month study.  
2. Veterans in the intervention group will have significantly reduced health care costs, as compared to the control group, at the end of the 24- month study.  
3. The immunosuppressant dashboard system will provide near real -time, 
actionable alerts that will allow the pharmacist to conduct timely intervenes on potential or ongoing drug- related problems . 
 
 [ADDRESS_729926] a 
statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups with regards to the primary aim of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555917].  To determine this, we 
used data from a recent national study conducted between 2009- 2012.
53 These results  
demonstrated that the rate of ED visits after transplant was 1.269 per person- year and 
48% of those ED visits resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. We will enroll 10 sites (5 sites for 
each study arm) and will have a total of just more than 1,[ADDRESS_729927] a 25% relative decrease in ED visit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555918] 80% power. 
The 25% relative improvement in rates is a conservative estimate of  intervention effect, 
based on previous pharmacist -led initiatives the investigators have conducted.15,16  After 
allowing for 15% loss to follow up, we require  a total of 1,[ADDRESS_729928] for counts with Poisson regression adjusting for intra-
cluster correlation and with alpha set at 0.05.  
 
9.2.1  Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Randomization will occur at the site level (cluster randomized trial).  Ten sites will be randomized to either the intervention arm or usual care arm using statistical software (SAS, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  Randomized will occur after all sites have agreed to participate and site -level regulatory approval has occurred.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_555951] e (<125 vs. ≥125 veteran organ transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]).  This will be done to ensure an approximate even distribution of patients across study arms.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_729929] of an intervention designed to improve medication safety within Veteran organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555919].  This population 
represents a high- risk group that has a high incidence of medication errors, non-
adherence and adverse drug events often leading to health care encounters, including ER visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which cause significant accrual of health care costs.  
 
     9.3.1 Primary outcome   
The primary outcome for this study will include the overall rate of ER visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], compared between the intervention and control groups.  These encounters will be captured electronically throughout the 24- month study through the 
use of the CDW, stored in the VINCI environment.  In addition, to ensure encounters are captured in a comprehensive manner, we will also link the VA CDW data to CMS (Medicare) claims data and capture non- VA ER and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118782]  (after 
study completion).  As most transplant patients are dual users and have Medicare 
 [ADDRESS_729930] ER visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555920], towards the latter half (second 12- months) of the study due 
to a lag effect of the intervention on this outcome.  This expectation is based on our previous research in this field and assessment of pharmacist interventions on medication safety and reduced adverse drug events requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  ER visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555921].  These will be defined based on encounter criteria within the CDW and CMS data:  all -cause ER visits and all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555922].    
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_729931] data will be standardized using the VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) definitions, which normalizes regional differences in costs due to variation in cost of living indices.  As with the primary outcome, we will also acquire and link CMS claims data to gain a comprehensive assessment of costs, including those that accrue from non- VA care  (after study completion) .  Costs will also be sub -analyzed 
into three predominant categories: inpatient costs, outpatient costs and pharmacy costs, as described in the statistical analysis plan.  To fully assess if the intervention is has a direct monetary benefit, we will measure costs of the intervention will include estimates of time and resources to implement the dashboard and train and support the intervention site pharmacists.  S imilar to primary outcome, we expect that as ER visits 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555923], there will be a corresponding decrease in overall costs as well, predominantly driven by [CONTACT_555952].  We expect this decrease to occur during the second [ADDRESS_729932]’s functionality by 
[CONTACT_555953], alert relevance, time and the actions taken with regards to the alert and the intervention magnitude.  We 
will measure and report the time effort needed to conduct the interventions by [CONTACT_555944].  Using REDCap, we will build an electronic data capture system, which allows the intervention pharmacists to efficiently enter alert and intervention information through a web- based portal, which will be housed within the VINCI environment.  This 
information will be captured during the first [ADDRESS_729933] to provide monthly measurements of the following:  percent of patients with missing laboratory assessments, percent of patients with alarming laboratory values without follow up scheduled, mean adherence to immunosuppression, based on refill timeliness and estimated using the PDC, percent of patients with a significant drug interaction without a immunosuppressant level and percent of patients with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555892].  These will be measured in all patients and compared between the intervention and control groups at monthly intervals.   
 As an exploratory assessment, we will measure and compare graft survival and patient mortality between intervention and control sites.  This study is not powered to determine if the intervention improves these clinical outcomes.   However, it is well established that 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219073] a substantial risk factor for graft loss and patient death.
53  Thus, it is 
possible that this intervention may produce differences with regards to these clinical outcomes, even if the magnitude of the estimates does not produce statistically significant differences.  We will also assess graft loss and mortality to ensure patient safety and that the intervention is not causing harm.  These data elements (death and graft loss) will be captured through both the VA system (VINCI) and linking to the transplant registry (UNOS).  The investigational team has experience with linking VA data to SRTR registry databases feels confident that this is feasible and will produce 
accurate measures of these important clinical outcomes.   
 
9.4 Data Analyses  
The data analysis will incorporate the intent -to-treat principle; namely, all participants 
enrolled in the intervention group will be included in the analysis and compared to all of 
the patients captured within the control group.  If a patient dies, has graft loss  or moves 
out of their study site, their data will be censored at that time point.  For comparative statistical assessments within the utilization outcomes, the  two groups will be compared 
using a generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) approach.
54  This approach allows for 
measurement of participants at different time points, clustering by [CONTACT_3885], missing data under the assumption of missing at random (MAR), time varying or invariant covariates, and can also account for the effect of correlated longitudinal measurements within participants. In addition, GLMM accommodates a wide range of distributional assumptions such as dichotomous (e.g. binomial), count (e.g. Poisson), continuous 
 27  (e.g. Gaussian), and categorical or ordinal outcomes.  For comparing the p rimary 
outcome (ED visit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]), we will use GLMM (with appropriate link 
function) with counts of these events as the outcome variable and intervention group (yes/no) as the primary independent variable.  This analysis is equivalent to Poisson regression or negative binomial regression (in the case of over -dispersion), both special 
cases of GLMM.   Additional adjustment covariables will be added to the model in a second set of analyses.  Covariates will include patient sociodemographics:   age, sex, 
race, comorbidities (using modified Elixhauser definitions), marital status and education.  In these models, donor information (age, sex, race, deceased or living) and transplant characteristics (HLA mismatches, ischemic times, panel reactive antibody levels, time since transplant)  will also be included .  This will assist in making valid intervention effect 
estimates after accounting for baseline differences, as there may be patient -level 
differences between groups. The magnitude of between intervention differences on outcome variables (effect sizes) at each time point will be estimated using appropriate contrasts in the corresponding GLMM models.  
 We anticipate that some of the count outcomes will exhibit excess zeros (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). If  the counts exhibit excess zeros, we will use zero -inflated (ZI) 
versions of the proposed model (zero inflated Poisson and zero- inflated negative 
binomial [NB]) to account for the excess zeros with random effects to account for clustering by [CONTACT_3725].
55 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_408699], Poisson regression is used to model count data where 
observations are assumed to be independent and the number of cases has variance equal to the mean for each level of the covariates. However, in practice, either the independence or equal mean and variance assumption is often violated, which can lead to over -dispersion (when the variance is greater than the conditional mean). Thus, we 
consider a NB model that handles the problem of over -dispersion and that does not 
assume an equal mean and variance assumption. In certain cases, over -dispersion may 
not be sufficiently modeled via the extra parameter in NB. In this case we will consider including random effects into the NB model. Zero inflated models such as ZINB can be used for modeling the excess zeros . The ZINB model is a mixture of NB model for the 
count part and a logit model for the excess zeros. The parameters in the ZINB model have conditional or latent class interpretations, which correspond to a susceptible subpopulation at risk for the condition (in our case ED visits/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) with counts generated from a NB distribution and a non- susceptible subpopulation that provides the 
extra or excess zeros. Thus, the ZINB model parameters are not well suited for quantifying the effect of an explanatory variable in the overall mixture population. We will use a marginalized ZINB model to estimate the population mean count directly, allowing straightforward inference for overall covariate effects.
[ADDRESS_729934] fitting model among the different models; further assessment of the goodness of fit for the final model is made via the Pearson goodness of ﬁt statistic. A model with a smalle r value of AIC, BIC, and a Pearson statistic close to 
one is considered a better fit of the data. We will use SAS 9.4, housed within the VINCI environment, to manage the data and fit all the models.  
 For the cost analysis , we will also utilize multivariable modelling and propensity score 
 28  calibration (PSC).[ADDRESS_729935] models will be estimated using log- normal or gamma models (special 
cases of GLMM) to examine the association of the intervention with cost, adjusting for the aforementioned patient sociodemographics, donor information and transplant characteristics. Cost will be obtained from VINCI CDW and HERC as inpatient, 
outpatient, pharmacy and total aggregate for two years prior to the study period and for the two years of the intervention. We will also account for non- VA costs through linkage 
with CMS claims d ata.  We will estimate different models adjusting for the clinical 
outcomes in order to examine the robustness of the results. GLMM allows for correlation between cost categories as well as for the likely skewed distribution of cost data. The Park test will be performed to check for the appropriate distribution of the cost data and AIC and BIC statistics for goodness of fit. Since, inpatient cost could exhibit a point mass of zero, we will use marginalized two- part models that are appropriate for 
semi- conti nuous data to model the relationship between the intervention and inpatient 
cost.
58, [ADDRESS_729936] and the time required to 
complete the intervention, there will be no comparisons or modeling within this analysis ; 
we will utilize standard descriptive statistics for these measurements, including mean (SD), median (IQR), proportion (%) and 95% confidence interval.  Variables assess ed 
for this outcome will be captured through input into the REDCap database by 
[CONTACT_555954].  We will compi[INVESTIGATOR_555924].  We will also determine the mean/median time required to complete the intervention on a daily basis and estimate the time per [ADDRESS_729937] system’s reporting thresholds and improve functionality if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_51857].  We will also assess the o verall functionality of the dashboard at the end of the first year to determine 
composite metrics.  Based on our experience with the current system, after an initial bolus effect, we expect the dashboard will produce two to three new alerts per 100 patient  days with one to two of these being relevant and actionable.  We will utilize 95% 
confidence intervals actual versus expected rates.  
 
We will handle missing data using several techniques including multiple imputation and 
maximum likelihood.
60  Missing dat a mechanisms will be examined using both 
univariate and multivariate methods. We will check for missing at random (MAR) by [CONTACT_40397] a missing indicator for each missing variable and study the predictors of missingness using logistic regression. If any of the fully observed covariates or outcomes becomes significant in the missing data model then we will use methods for MAR if we do not have any reason to believe that the missing data mechanism is not at random. The proposed GLMM models, which are mixed effects models for the longitudinal data analyses, can handle data that are missing at random (MAR) and provide robust estimates.  For the cross -sectional data analysis plan, we will use 
 [ADDRESS_729938].  These data elements include diagnoses, laboratory values, medication regimens, refill histories, provider types and health care encounters (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ER visits), gathered and queried on a daily basis.  The pharmacists at intervention sites will access their site -
specific  dashboard information stored on the server through an end- user permission 
access link that will restrict which patients are visible to ensure appropriateness of access to the correct PHI.   
 For the research component of the proposal, data will be captured through the research CDW and housed within the VINCI environment.  We will lin k the VA data  to the SRTR 
registry and CMS claims data.  The CDW will provide data to assess outcomes including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ER visits and costs, as well as mortality.  CDW data will also be used to assess interventions by [CONTACT_555955]’ progress notes.  The CMS data will provide non- VA health care utilization, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_510727], 
as well as non- VA cost estimates.  The SRTR data will provide all baseline donor, 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_555925], including acute allograft rejection, graft loss and death.  We will also capture pharmacist entered data, which will be their assessments  of the dashboard system .  We will deploy a web -based 
data entry system that the intervention pharmacists will use during the first year of the 
intervention to assess the dashboard functionality.  Queries answered by [CONTACT_555956], how many were considered clinically relevant/actionable, time to conduct the intervention and general intervention types.  This data will be captured through the use of the REDCap system.   
 After data is cleaned and completely ready for analysis, we will remove identifiers from the final datasets.  This will minimize the risk of loss of confidentiality.  All data will be stored on the VINCI system and only approved study personnel will have access to this data.  
 
10.2 Quality Assurance  
 
 30  10.3.1  Training  
Pharmacists randomized to the intervention will participate in a two -day intensive 
training conference held at the coordinating site (Charleston, SC).  During this training, 
the dashboards functionality will be reviewed, along with the standard operating procedure manual which fully guides interventions.  During this training conference, the 
intervention pharmacists will also complete competencies, using case- based questions.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_165447]:  review of dashboard specifics, running the dashboard to create alerts, assessing clinical relevance of alerts, alert categories, interventions to address alerts, clinical and research documentation, provider collaboration mechanisms, motivational interviewing training and case- review 
sessions.  The investigational team will lead these sessions and utilize local experts to deliver the presentations and lead the case- based sessions.  The full training program 
will be developed after sites are randomized and the final dates of the training 
conference are agreed upon by [CONTACT_8979].   
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_729939] or will be approved by [CONTACT_102]’s VA primary care provider or other provider as appropriate.  Thus, all interventions deliver ed as part of this study will be within usual care standards and 
practices. 
As another quality assurance step, the coordinating site will oversee and review study 
interventions through querying the REDCap database system; these will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_555912].  This is partic ularly the case for interventions involving changes in immunosuppression 
regimens. If there are concerns with specific interventions made by [CONTACT_555944], these will be addressed on a case- by-case basis.  During the course of the 
study, if an intervention pharmacist has a particular issue that is time sensitive and is unsure how to address it, they will have the ability to call and/or page the PI [INVESTIGATOR_555913], which includes expertise in transplant -related care.  For non-
urgent issues, pharmacists can send secure emails to investigational team members or bring up the issue during conference calls.  Thus, there will be ample training and resources available to all intervention site pharmacists to ensure the study is conducted in a safe clinically appropriate manner with strong fidelity.

 [ADDRESS_729941] (IRB) Review  
The VA Central IRB and VA R&Ds boards will review and approve the funded protocol, 
ensure protection of patient privacy and safety, and monitor the study on an ongoing basis. Serious adverse events will be reported to the VA CIRB and VA R&D as they occur. Annual reports to the VA CIRB and R&D will indicate serious adverse events, new findings that may influence continuation of the study, and reports of the IOC. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_729942], prior to randomization, will provide written informed consent (see Appendix II for informed consent document).  The informed consent process of each pharmacist will occur over 
the phone, between the principle investigator and each pharmacist.  The informed consent document will be provided to each pharmacist prior to the call, to give them ample time to read and comprehend each component of the consent.  During the consent call, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_555926], the voluntary nature of the study for each site pharmacist, the expected role, activities and duration of activities for each pharmacist and that there will be no punitive actions taken should the pharmacist not wish to continue with the study.  We will ensure each pharmacist of this by [CONTACT_555958] a letter (see Appendix III) stating this explicitly.  The informed consent will also state that there are no incentives or promises provided to 
each pharmacist by [CONTACT_6231], including, but not limited to: promotion, salary support, increase in grade or step or co- authorship on publications that ar ise from 
this research.  After the informed consent document is read and reviewed by [CONTACT_555959], they will be given the opportunity to ask questions about the expectations of the study.  Following this, each site pharmacist willing to participate in the study will 
electronically sign and date the form (using their PIV -enabled signature [CONTACT_104846]) and email 
the form back to the principle investigator using the internal VA email system and encrypting the email. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_555927] -enabled signature [CONTACT_104846], finalizing the informed consent 
process for that participating pharmacist.  
We are requesting waiver of patient informed consent.  We are also requesting waiver of HIPAA  authorization for all patients.  Per Federal guidelines, this research meets the 
requirements of minimal risk and thus waiver of informed consent may be granted through regulatory oversight if this research fulfills the following four criteria:
63,64  
 33   
1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects  
2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of the 
subjects  
3) the research could not be practicably carried out without the waiver or alteration  
4) whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent 
information after participation  
At the control group centers, there will be no study -related contact [CONTACT_555960] .  Within the interv ention 
group, those patients that are not contact[CONTACT_555961] (no medication safety issues identified by [CONTACT_555962]) also will not provide informed consent  or 
HIPAA authorization  as no study related contact [CONTACT_555963] .  For 
those patients that are contact[CONTACT_555964] a result of a dashboard alert, the care provided is usual care that should be provided to this patient population, that is prompted by [CONTACT_555965]. The care prompted may have also been provided in 
the control group in the same situation. The contact [CONTACT_555966] a tool to assist in their day -to-
day workflow. Given these facts, it is not practical or feasible to obtain informed c onsent 
in patients.  Thus, we are requesting waiver of patient informed consent. The study is minimal risk and meets these criteria.  
Ethical considerations for conducting cluster randomized studies have been thoroughly discussed and vetted within the research community.  Precedent is well -established that 
obtaining individual -level informed consent to conduct such studies is not an absolute; 
and, in fact, there are numerous examples within the biomedical literature of conducting such trials with a waiver of  documentation of written informed consent.  Based on this 
literature and a review of the interventions and specifics regarding site- level randomized 
trials, the investigative team feels strongly that this proposal meets the four aforementioned criteria, is clearly a minimal risk study and is be capable of being safely completed with a waiver of written consent.  Specifically, the research does meet 
Federal guidelines for minimal risk, which is “research in which the probability and magnitude of possible harms implied by [CONTACT_555967].”  Since the intervention is being conducted at the site- level as a clinical 
program, it qualifies under this definition.  By [CONTACT_555968], this research will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of subjects.  Because the intervention is being initiated at  the 
site-level, in a parallel arm design, it could not practically be carried out without this 
waiver.  Finally, we have a detailed and in -depth plan for dissemination of the results 
and further roll out of the intervention, which will allow patients to gain information of the potential effectiveness of this intervention after the completion of the study.  Thus, this proposal meets the requirement s of waiver of documentation of written informed 
consent and there is strong precedent from other cluster randomized trials that waiver is 
appropriate for this type of study design.
63-66 
 
 34  There are minimal risks to patient safety during the completion of t his study within the 
intervention arm and no risks with regards to study interventions within the control arm: 
no investigational medications will be used and all changes to patients’ current medication regimens will be made in accordance with VA standards  of care. The 
pharmacists providing the intervention will be thoroughly trained on use of the dashboard and delivery of the intervention.  They will be guided by [CONTACT_555969] a detailed standard operating procedure manual.  In addition, they wi ll have access 
to expert level advice from the coordinating center, which includes a transplant hepatologist, transplant nephrologist, internal medicine physician and transplant clinical pharmacy specialist with over [ADDRESS_729943] and will be communicated in appropriate fashion to the Veterans’ other providers. The pharmacists will work closely in a collaborative manner, with the Veteran’s physicians to 
facilitate the management of significant medication safety issues or concerns that are identified.

protection. We will take careful precautions to maintain confidentiality for all participants, 
including both the pharmacists and patients . All research data will be electronically 
stored on the VINCI server, included data that is manually entered into the system via REDCap . There will be no paper data collection forms and no entry of data onto 
portable electronic devices or local storage devices. We will minimize the collection of PHI that which is necessary to complete the study Aims.  Paper documents pertaining to this  study, as required by [CONTACT_555970], will be stored in locked file cabinets at 
the Charleston VAMC Research Suite (where [CONTACT_555973]’s VA office is located). When study results are published or presented, only aggregate reports of the results will be  
used and Veterans’ identities will not be revealed. All investigators and project personnel will also complete a certified program of instruction in the protection of human subjects in research, such as the VA website tutorial, NIH website tutorial, or the University of Miami CITI course. These courses in the responsible conduct of research and the protection of human research participants will be completed on an annual basis in compliance with institutional, PHS, and NIH regulations.  
 
11.4 Study Discontinuatio n  
The study will be discontinued based on the recommendations of the IOC  and/or the 
expert transplant nephrologist opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  These decisions will be based on bi -annual 
reports provided by [CONTACT_555971].  Discontinuation will be recommended 
if the intervention demonstrates increased harm or potential harm to veterans at sites randomized to the intervention.  This decision will be made based on clinically or statis tically significant differences that are apparent in SAE rates between intervention 
and usual care sites.  Worrisome trends will also be considered in the IOC  decision.  
 [ADDRESS_729945] such studies is not an 
absolute; and, in fact, there are numerous examples within the biomedical literature of conducting such trials with a waiver of documentation of written informed consent.  
Based on this literature and a review of the interventions and specifics regarding site-level randomized trials, the investigative team feels  strongly that this proposal meets the 
four aforementioned criteria, is clearly a minimal risk study and is be capable of being safely completed with a waiver of documentation of written informed consent  from each 
patient .  Specifically, the research does meet Federal guidelines for minimal risk, which 
is “research in which the probability and magnitude of possible harms implied by [CONTACT_555967].”  Since the intervention is being conducted at the site- level as a clinical program, it qualifies under this definition.  By 
[CONTACT_555968], this research will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of subjects.  Because the intervention is being initiated at the site- level, in a parallel arm design, it 
could not practically be carried out without waiver of documentation of written informed consent .  Finally, we have a detailed and in -depth  plan for dissemination of the results 
and further roll out of the intervention, which will allow patients to gain information of the potential effectiveness of this intervention after the completion of the study.   Thus, this 
proposal meets the requirements of waiver of documentation of written informed consent and there is strong precedent from other cluster randomized trials that waiver is 
appropriate for this type of study design.
63-[ADDRESS_729946] of the PI, co -investigators, study coordinator, data manager and 
consultants on the proposal. The functions of the IOC  will include: 1) providing scientific 
oversight; 2) reviewing all serious adverse events (graft loss and death events, comp ared across intervention groups) or complications related to the study; 3) 
monitoring site adherence to the intervention; 4) reviewing summary reports relating to compliance with research protocol requirements; and 5) providing advice on resource allocatio n. The IOC  will meet bi- annually and as necessary by [CONTACT_756]. The 
recommendations of the IOC will be reviewed,  and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_165448]. As part of this oversight, we will also recruit an 
 [ADDRESS_729947] monthly 
meetings to discuss the intervention, identify and resolve study related issues and discuss pertinent study -related materials.  
 
14 P
UBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
We plan to present the findings of these research efforts at national meetings via 
submission of research abstracts and also plan to publish the results of this research in several manuscripts.  There are six planned manuscripts, which may increase or decrease depending on study operations and findings.  The six manuscripts include the following:  
1. Study design, rationale, barriers, pi[INVESTIGATOR_531133]  
2. Technical dashboard development and validation  
3. Methodology paper on developi[INVESTIGATOR_212741] a transplant cohort within the VA system  
4. Primary outcomes of the clinical trial – utilization across study arms  
5. Secondary costs outcomes of the clinical trial, including cost -benefit analysis  
6. Descriptive paper detailing the interventions made by [CONTACT_555972], including medication adherence and safety events  
Authorship and author order will be discussed during conference calls.  Lead authors will be identified and author panels will be decided upon during these calls.  There is no promise or expectation of authorship simply from participating as a site pharmac ist for 
this study.  Disputes with authorship and order will be resolved prior to the drafting of papers and will be determined through majority consensus of the panel.  We plan to disseminate the results of the research to the transplant and VA communities at large. We will work with operations partners, which include those within VISN [ADDRESS_729948] system, along with training and educational requirements for pharmacists and other health care professionals to utilize the system  to improve the 
monitoring and management of Veteran organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  We will seek to present this information at cyber seminars and regional and national meetings and conferences, both within the formal context of research conferences and inf ormally, 
through administrative and operational meetings .

Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  1.0 Background   
 
1.1 Diffuse large cell lymphoma and follicular grade III B cell lymphoma.   
 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of malignancies of the 
lymphatic system, with a clinical course ranging from very indolent to highly aggressive (Armitage and Weisenburger 1998) . Aggressive NHLs constitute 
approximately 60% of NHL, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL) being the most common (approximately half of all aggressive NHL cases). Follicular grade III NHL is thought to have similar biology and outcome to DLCL(Rodriguez , et al  1999) and 
traditionally the treatment approach to follicular grade III A and B lymphoma has been the same as to DLCL (Anderson , et al  1993, Bierman 2007) . The  following protocol 
treatment options will use the term DLCL broadly, with the inclusion of follicular grade III lymphoma unless specified otherwise.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_907551] of  care for the  
initial therapy of  patients with advanced DLCL  (Cooper , et al  1994, Gordon, et al  1992) ; 
of available combinations, a regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone (CHOP) is the widely accepted choice due to its efficacy and favorable toxicity profile.  Recent studies have shown  an improvement in response rate (RR), event 
free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the addition of rituximab to the 
CHOP regimen (R -CHOP) (Coiffier, et al  2002, Habermann, et al  2006, Pfreundschuh, et 
al 2004) .  The results of representative studies are summarized in Table 1.

As evident from the above cited studie s, despi[INVESTIGATOR_671723], a significant proportion of patients will relapse, especially the elderly, those with bulky disease and high IPI [INVESTIGATOR_671724]. Although some of the 
relapsed patients will be salvaged with second line chemotherapy (usually followed by 
[CONTACT_212281]078E 6 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation for transplant eligible 
patients), the majority will succumb to the disease (Seyfarth , et al  2006, Singer and 
Goldstone 1986) . Improvements in initial therapy lead ing to decreased relapse rates are 
clearly needed.   
 
1.3 Lenalidomide in hematological malignancies.  
 
Lenalidomide (REVLIMID, Celgene Corp., NJ, [LOCATION_003]) is a proprietary IMiD ® 
compound. The mechanism of action of lenalidomide is complex and involves immune 
modulation (Haslett , et al  2003), antiangioge netic potential (Zhang, et al  2005) and impact 
on the microenvironment and tumor itself (Pellagatti , et al  2007) .  Lenalidomide is 
marketed in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of subjects with transfusion dependent  
anemia due to low - or intermediate -1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  associated 
with a deletion 5-q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic  
abnormalities based on the improvement of anemia (List , et al  2005).  It is also used in 
combination with dexamethasone for subjects with previously treated multiple myeloma 
based on significant antitumor activity (Rajkumar , et al  2005, Richardson, e t al 2002).  
 Lenalidomide has also shown activity in refractory/relapsed chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL) (Chanan -Khan , et al  2006) . Of forty-
five enrolled patients, the majority of which were fludarabine refractory, 47% had 
evidence of a response, with 9% of the patients attaining complete remission.
 Fatigue, 
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were the most common adverse effects noted in 83%, 
78%, and 78% of the patients respectively. “Flare reaction” – inflamed and often enlarged 
lymph nodes, was seen in 58% of patients, usually during the first cycle of therapy. The 
onset was usually seen within [ADDRESS_907553] dose, with a median duration of 14 
days. The initial 29 patients did not receive any prophylaxis, and on development of the 
flare reaction, ibuprofen was used for treatment.  However , a few patients required 
additional oral morphine for pain control. Prednisone prophylaxis was used for the 
subsequent 16 patients, preventing flare. None of the patients (with or without the 
prophylaxis) required interruption, discontinuation, or dose re duction of therapy because 
of flare reaction. It appears that presence of flare reaction correlated with a high NK cell 
numbers prior to therapy and with clinical benefit (prolonged progression free survival) 
(Asher Chanan-Khan, personal communication, August 2007).  
 
1.4 Lenalidomide in diffuse large cell lymphoma  
 
The phase II study of lenalidomide (Celgene 002) in patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive non- Hodgkin's lymphoma has been conducted and the initial results reported 
by [CONTACT_671753] -agent activity of lenalidomide in 
relapsed large cell NHL (Wiernik, 2007). Patients received 25 mg of lenalidomide orally 
once daily on days 1-21 every 28 days and continued therapy for 52 weeks as tolerated or 
until disease progre ssion. As of enrollment cut-off, 50 patients were enrolled and 49 
received the drug. Forty- one patients were evaluable for response. The median age was 
65 (46-84) and 18 were female. Histology was DLBCL (n=21), follicular center lymphoma grade 3 [FL] (n=3) , mantle cell lymphoma [MCL] (n=14) and transformed 
[TSF] (n=3). Fourteen patients (34%) exhibited an objective response (5 complete responses unconfirmed (CRu) and 9 partial responses (PR)), 12 had stable disease (SD) 
MC078E 7 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  for a tumor control rate (TCR) of 63% and 15 progressive disease (PD). Responses were 
seen in each of the aggressive histologic subtypes studied: DLBCL (5/21), MCL (6/14), 
FL (2/3), and TSF (1/3). Progression-free survival (PFS), although ongoing, is currently 
> 239 (>191 - >373) days in patients experiencing CRu and > 160 (>54 - >251) days in 
patients with PR. The drug was well -tolerated with the most common Grade 4 adverse 
events were neutropenia (8.2%) and thrombocytopenia (8.2%), while most common Grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (2 2%), leukopenia (14%) and 
thrombocytopenia (12%). In contrast to CLL, tumor flare reaction was not seen. Preliminary data from the Celgene [ADDRESS_907554] that the absolute lymphocyte count is a factor in response (Submitted ASH 2007).  
 
The significant activity of single agent lenalidomide in relapsed diffuse large cell 
lymphoma, the novel mechanism of action with lenalidomide compared with traditional 
cytotoxic therapy, and the need to further improve the RCHOP regimen provides a strong 
rationale for bringing lenalidomide to upfront therapy in DLCL.  
 
1.5 Rationale for Expansion Cohort  
 
Gene expression profiling revealed 3 molecular subsets of DLBCL: germinal -center B -
cell-like (GCB) vs. activated B -cell-like (A BC) vs. unclassified lymphoma subtype 
(UCL). The ABC DLBCL  constitutes approximately 40 % of all DLBCL and is 
associated with inferior outcome despi[INVESTIGATOR_671725]. The 2 year progression free survival for ABC DLBCL treated with RCHOP is 40% in contrast to 
82% for GCB type (Lenz et al, 2008).   
 
Therefore, there is a critical need to evaluate impact of therapy on outcomes of patients with DLBCL based on molecular subtype. Recent data indicate that there are significant 
differences in response rates and progression free survival for patients treated with 
lenalidomide based on molecular DLBCL subtype in a setting of refractory/relapsed 
disease (Czuczman et al., ASCO Annual Meeting, [ADDRESS_907555] 8038). In this study of 
40 patients with r elapsed DLBCL, lenalidomide treatment is associated with higher 
response rates and progression free survival in ABC -like DLBCL versus GCB- like 
DLBCL (50% vs. 11% and median PFS of 336 vs. 42 days). Importantly, lenalidomide was associated with meaningful clinical benefit in patients with both molecular subtypes 
of DLBCL. Indeed responding patients with GCB –like subtype enjoyed progression free 
survival similar to ABC group (median over 200 days). It is unknown if degree of the clinical benefit of lenalidomide in combination with chemotherapy is dependent on 
molecular DLBCL subtype in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL. The expansion 
cohort allows analysis of outcomes of patients treated with R2CHOP based on DLBCL 
molecular subtype.

7.22 Definitions of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
 
7.221 For this protocol, dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as 
follows: an adverse event attributed (definitely, probably or possibly 
related ) to the study treatment and meeting following criteria with the 
first cycle : 
   
Toxicity  Definition  
Hematologic  Either:  
1. PLT <25,000 for ≥7days or platelet nadir <10,000 at 
anytime  
2. Failure to recover counts to PLT ≥ 75,000 and/or  ANC 
≥1500 by [CONTACT_4475] 28 after  initiation of  cycle 1 treatment.  
Infection  Grade 4  
Non-hematologic  Either:  
1. ≥ grade 3 as per NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events v3.0*  
2. Any toxicities that caused dose delay of > 1 week of 
the intended next dose  
*Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea with maximal supportive treatment(s) will be 
considered dose-limiting. Fatigue and mouth sores that are considered Grade 3 and are 
considered to be due to treatment (definitely, probably, or possibly related ) will be 
considered as dose- limiting.  
  
7.23 Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) Determination  
 
 The MTD in this study will be defined as the dose level below the lowest dose 
that induces dose- limiting toxicity in at least one -third of patients (at least 2 of a 
maximum of 6 new patients). This will be defined on cycle 1 data; however, 
MC078E 18 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov [ADDRESS_907576] 3 weeks to assess toxicity.  
 
7.242 If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is not seen in any of the 3 patients, up to 
3 new patients will be accrued and treated at the next higher dose level (as specified in 7.2 1). If DLT is seen in [ADDRESS_907577] one of these additional three patients (≥2 of 6), the 
MTD will have been exceeded, and further accrual will cease to this 
cohort. If potentially dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) is not seen in any of 
the three additional patients, [ADDRESS_907578] been exceeded and defined 
as the previous dose unless only 3 patients were treated at the lower dose 
level. In that case, 3 additional patients will be treated at this lower dose 
level such that a total of 6 patients are treated at the MTD to more fully 
assess the toxicities associated with the MTD.  
 
7.25 Dose De -escalation from Dose Level 1  
 
7.251  If 2 treatment -related DLTs are observed at the starting dose level, 
patients will be accrued to level - 1. The accrual rules based on observed 
DLT will be as outlined in 7.24 with deceleration to dose - 2 if necessary.  
 
7.26 If a patient in phase I part fails to complet e cycle 1 for reasons other than 
toxicity, the patient will be regarded as inevaluable and will be replaced.  In each 
instance, however, a specific notification needs to be made for review by [CONTACT_671757].

Protocol Version Date:  30Nov [ADDRESS_907579] reduction 
required for any single adverse event observed.  Reductions or increases apply to treatment given 
in the preceding cycle and are based on  adverse events observed since the prior dose.  
 Omit = The current dose(s) during a cycle is skipped. The patient does not make up the omitted dose(s) at 
a later time.  
Hold = Refers to decision made at the beginning of the cycle to delay the start of the c ycle until the 
patient meets the protocol criteria to restart drug.  
  
NOTE:  Patients in whom one or more R2CHOP study treatment agents have been discontinued will 
remain on study unless all R2CHOP study treatment agents are discontinued.  Patients in whom all the R2CHOP study treatment agents were discontinued will proceed to event monitoring (see Section 18.0).

In the event of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed:  hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals.   
 
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe neutropenia (grade 3 or 4), broad- spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed.  
Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_671734].  
 
9.5 Use of statin drugs (i.e. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133], Zocor, etc.) is strongly discouraged while on study

10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.1 This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
v3.0 for adverse event monitoring and reporting.  The CTC v3.0 can be accessed via the 
CTEP home page: http://ctep.cancer.gov/
.  All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE v3.0. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_907589], identify and grade the  severity of the event using the CTCAE.  Next, 
determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (refer to Sections 10.12 and 15.0) and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.13).  With this information, determine whether an adverse event should be reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.2) in addition to the routinely reported clinical data (see Sections 10.31 and 18.0). 
 
Expedited adverse event reporting requires submission of a written report, bu t 
may also involve telephone notifications.  Telephone and written reports are to be completed within the timeframes specified in Section 10.2.  All expedited adverse event reports should also be submitted to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB).   
MC078E 24 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017   
10.12 Expected vs. Unexpected  
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent- specific 
adverse event information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific adverse event 
information  provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol.  
 
10.13 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 Definite - The adverse event is clearly  related to the investigational agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s).  
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the  investigational agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the investigational 
agent(s) 
 
10.14 When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following apply:  • When an investigational agent(s) is used in combi nation with a commercial 
agent(s), the combination is considered investigational.  Expedited reporting of adverse events follows the guidelines for investigational agents.

A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose):  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 1 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] 
• Results in persiste nt or significant disability or incapacity 2 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event 3 
• Suspected positive pregnancy 
  1“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the serious adverse event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out nor mal life

3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threa tening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_671738].  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be 
considered as medically important.

inform Celgene  in writing  of any SAE within [ADDRESS_907593] be completed and supplied to 
Celgene by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours/[ADDRESS_907594](s).  
Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end 
date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) 
must be documented on a follow -up MEDWATCH. A final report to 
document resolution of the SAE is required.  The Celgene protocol 
number (RV -NHL -PI-325) and institutional protocol number should be 
included on SAE reports (or on the fax cover letter) sent to Celgene.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SAE report to Celgen e 
should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient records. 
   
10.223 Pregnancies 
 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject 
is on lenalidomide or within [ADDRESS_907595]’s last dose of  lenalidomide, are considered immediately reportable events.  Lenalidomide is to be 
discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by 
[CONTACT_64823]. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
 The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the 
pregnancy, and must notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately of the 
outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using the 
Pregnancy Follow-up report Form.  If the outcome of the pregnancy was

treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
 
11.23 The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a 
physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination 
and should be considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to 
lymphoma should disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is 
not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain 
lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood 
volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma. 
 Similarly, other organs considered to be enlarged before therapy due to 
involvement by [CONTACT_56927], such as liver and kidneys, must have decreased in size.

11.3 Criteria for Partial Response (PR). The designation of PR requires all of the following:  
 
11.[ADDRESS_907599] a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six 
of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be 
selected according to all of the following:  
• they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions  
• if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body  
• they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease 
whenever these sites are involved 
 
11.[ADDRESS_907600]

 50% in their SPD or, for single 
nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.  
 
11.34 With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is 
usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present. 
11.35 Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified 
(eg, large -cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR

15.0 Drug Information  
 
15.1  Lenalidomide (Revlimid , CC-5013, CDC-501)    
 
Please consult the most current Investigator’s Brochure and package insert for 
complete drug information.  
 
15.11 Background : Lenalidomide has a wide range of effects, including the inhibition 
of hematopoietic tumor cell proliferation, the enhancement of T cells and natural 
killer (NK) cell activity, the modulation of stem cell differentiation, the inhibition 
of angiogenesis, and the inhibition of inflammation . 
 15.12 Formulation : For clinical study, lenalidomide is provided as 1.25-, 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 
15-, 20-, and 25- mg capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains 
lenalidomide as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.  
 
Placebo capsules for the 1.[ADDRESS_907614]. 
 
The lenalidomide and placebo capsules are supplied in push- through blister foil 
or tamper -evident, child -resistant, opaque, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
containers with HDPE caps. 
 15.13 Preparation and storage : Lenalidomide should be stored at room 
temperature, between 59 and 86ºF (15-30ºC).  Store drug away from direct sunlight.   
 
15.14 Administration:   Capsules are administered by [CONTACT_324215]. Patients 
should not break, chew or open the ca psules.  
  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
a)  Absorption – Lenalidomide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_671739], with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.[ADDRESS_907615] -dose. Co- admi nistration 
with a high -fat and high- calorie meal in healthy subjects reduced the extent of 
absorption, resulting in an approximately 20% decrease in AUC and 50% 
decrease in C
max in plasma.   
 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_671740], the drug was administered without regard to food intake. Thus, lenalidomide can be administered with or without food.  
Multiple dosing (up to 100 mg BID) did not cause marked drug accumulation.   
 
MC078E 41 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017   b)  Distrib ution – In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins 
binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%. 
 
c)  Metabolism – Lenalidomide undergoes limited metabolism. Unchanged 
lenalidomide is the predominant circulating component in humans. Two 
identified metabolites are hydroxy-lenalidomide and N- acetyl -lenalidomide; each 
constitutes less than 5% of parent levels in circulation.  
 d)  Excretion – Elimination is primarily renal.  Approximately 65% to 85% of 
lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion in subjects with 
normal renal function. The half -life of elimination is approximately 3 to 4 hours 
(2 to 3 hours in patients 5 to 21 years) at the clinically relevant doses (5 to 50 
mg/day). Steady- state levels are achieved within 4 days. 
 
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions:  In vitro studies demonstrate that lenalidomide is not a substrate of CYP enzymes. In addition, lenalidomide shows little inhibitory 
or induction potential towards the CYP enzymes in vitro. Hence, 
coadministration of C YP substrates, inhibitors, or inducers with lenalidomide is 
not likely to result in clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in humans.  
 
In vitro, lenalidomide is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, OAT1, 
OAT3, OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, OCTN1, or OCTN2. Thus, it is 
unlikely that substrates or inhibitors of these transporters would affect 
lenalidomide disposition in humans.  
 
Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of BSEP, BCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT2. Thus, lenalidomide is not anti cipated to cause 
any significant drug-drug interactions due to inhibition of these transporters. 
 
Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and is not anticipated to cause any significant drug -drug interactions due to UGT1A1 inhibition. 
 In vitro, lenalidomide is a weak substrate, but not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp). 
 Erythropoietic agents or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, 
such as hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives, should be used with caution in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide with 
dexamethasone.  
  Periodic monitoring of digoxin plasma levels is recommended due to increased 
C
max and AUC with concomitant lenalidomide therapy.  Close monitoring of PT 
and INR is recommended in multiple myeloma patients taking concomitant warfarin.

15.17  Known potential toxicities :   
 Pregnancy Warning: Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study similar to birth defects caused by 
[CONTACT_324216]. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, a teratogenic 
effect of Lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out .  Pregnancy must be 
excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy during treatment by [CONTACT_324217].

15.3 Rituximab (Rituxan®, C2B8)  
 
15.31 Background : Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 
antigen on B- lymphocytes. CD20 regulates cell cycle i nitiation; and, possibly, 
functions as a calcium channel. Rituximab binds to the antigen on the cell surface, activating complement -dependent cytotoxicity; and to human Fc 
receptors, mediating cell killing through an antibody- dependent cellular toxicity.  
 
15.32 Formulation : Commercially available for injection, solution [preservative free]: 
10 mg/mL (10 mL, 50 mL) [contains Polysorbate 80]. 
 15.33 Preparation, storage, and stability : Refer to package insert for complete 
preparation and dispensing instructi ons. Store vials at refrigeration temperature, 
do not freeze or shake. Protect vials from direct sunlight. Withdraw the necessary 
amount of rituximab and dilute to a final concentration of 1-4 mg/mL with 0.9% 
NaCL or D
5W. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution; do not shake. Solutions 
MC078E 46 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  for infusion are stable at 2ºC to 8ºC for 24 hours and at room temperature for an 
additional 24 hours.  
 15.34 Administration:   Do not administer I.V. push or bolus. Refer to treatment 
section for specific infusion instructi ons. Suggested administration guidelines 
are: 
Initial infusion: Start rate of 50 mg/hour; if there is no reaction, increase the rate 
by 50 mg/hr every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour.  
Subsequent infusions: If patient did not tolerate initial infusion follow initial 
infusion guidelines. If patient tolerated initial infusion, start at 100 mg/hour; if 
there is no reaction; increase the rate by 100 mg/hour every 30 minutes, to a 
maximum of 400 mg/hour.  
Note:  If a reaction occurs, slow or stop the infus ion. If the reaction abates, restart 
infusion at 50% of the previous rate.  
 
Accelerated infusion rate (90 minutes):  For patients with previously untreated follicular NHL and diffuse large B -cell NHL who are receiving a corticosteroid 
as part of their comb ination chemotherapy regimen, have a circulating 
lymphocyte count <5000/mm
3, or have no significant cardiovascular disease. 
After tolerance has been established (no grade 3 or 4 infusion- related event) at 
the recommended infusion rate in cycle 1, a rapid i nfusion rate may be used 
beginning with cycle 2. The daily corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and 
diphenhydramine are administered prior to treatment, then the rituximab dose is 
administered over 90 minutes, with 20% of the dose administered over the first 
30 minutes and the remaining 80% is given over 60 minutes. If the 90- minute 
infusion in cycle 2 is tolerated, the same rate may be used for the remainder of 
the treatment regimen (through cycles 6 or 8).  
  15.35 Pharmacokinetic information :

16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 
16.1 Overview:  This is a phase I/II study in newly diagnosed diffuse large cell and follicular 
grade III A/B B -cell lymphoma patients treated with a combination of lenalidomide, 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R2CHOP).  The 
phase I portion of this study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
of R2CHOP in this patient population.  The phase II portion of this study will use a one-
stage design to assess the efficacy of R2CHOP in this patient population.  
 
16.11 Primary Endpoint:   The primary endpoint of the phase I portion of this trial is 
toxicity.  For the phase II portion of this trial, the primary endpoint is event -free 
survival at 12 months (EFS12).  An event will be defined as death due to any cause, tumor progression or relapse (by [CONTACT_3610]), or initiation of subsequent anti-
lymphoma therapy following R2CHOP study therapy.  A patient will be 
considered a success if they are event-free at 12 months. 
 
16.12 Sample Size:  This phase I portion of this study is expected to require a minimum 
of 9 and a maximum of 18 patients.  The 6 patients treated at the MTD in the 
phase I portion will also be included in the phase II portion.  An additional 26 
evaluable patients will be accrued at the MTD dose level for a maximum of 32 
evaluable patients in the phase II portion of this study.  If a patient is found to be ineligible after enrollment due to centr al pathology review, they will be replaced. 
 We anticipate accruing maximum of 3 additional patients during the phase II portion of the trial to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment 
violation, or other reasons.  Therefore, the phase II portion is expected to accrue 
a maximum of 35 patients and the overall sample size will be a maximum of 47 patients.  
 
As of Addendum 6, it is estimated that approximately 60% of DLBCL patients 
accrued to this study will have non- GCB lymphoma.  Approximatel y [ADDRESS_907631] 37 evaluable patients 
with this subtype.  We anticipate accruing 5 additional patients  (overaccrual of 
15%) to  account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other 
reasons for a total of 37 additional DLBCL patients.  With 65  patients already 
accrued to the phase II portion of this study, there will be a total of 102 patients 
in the phase II portion and 108 patients overall.  
 
As of Addendum 8, ECOG will open a study for DLBCL patients that will be a replacement for this study for patients with DLBCL.   DLBCL patients will no 
longer be accrued to this study.  To further explore the R2CHOP regimen, this 
study will now focus on other subtypes of lymphoma to evaluate efficacy and 
toxicity.   We anticipate accruing 35 evaluable patients with transformed or 
MC078E 55 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov [ADDRESS_907632] been accrued to this study and a maximum of 7 additional patients with DLBCL may be accrued before activation of Addendum 8.  Therefore, a maximum of 144 may 
be accrued overall. 
 16.13 Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate is [ADDRESS_907633] patient accrued has been observed 
for 2 years.  
  
Phase I Portion (Cohort I) : 
This portion of the study is designed t o determine the MTD and toxicity of R2CHOP in patients 
with newly diagnosed diffuse large cell and follicular grade III A/B B -cell lymphoma.  
 
16.2  Study Design:  This portion of the study will consist of a single- arm, phase I trial to 
determine the MTD of  R2CHOP.    
 
16.21   MTD Determination:  MTD is defined as the dose level below the lowest dose 
that induces dose- limiting toxicity in at least one -third of patients (at least 2 of a 
maximum of 6 new patients). See section 7.2 for the MTD determination 
algorithm and DLT definitions. 
 
16.22 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
 
16.221 Adverse Events Profile:  The number and severity of all adverse events will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population. The grade 
3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar 
fashion. This will provide an indication of the level of tolerance for this 
treatment combination in this patient group.  
 16.222 Toxicity Profile:  As per NCI CTCAE v3.0, the term toxicity is defined 
as adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to study treatment.  Non- hematologic toxicities will be 
evaluated via the ordinal CTC standard toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will 
be assessed using continuous variables as the outcome measures

Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via CTC standard toxicity 
grading.  Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by [CONTACT_671764] . Frequency 
distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will 
form the basis of these analyses.  
 
Phase II Portion (Cohort II)  
 
16.3  Statistical Design:  
 
16.31  Decision Rule:  The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 80%, and the 
smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 95%.  The following one- stage 
design uses [ADDRESS_907634] 80%.  Success is defined as being event -
free at 12 months. 
 
16.311 Final Decision Rule:  If [ADDRESS_907635] 32 evaluable patients, we may recommend further testing of this regimen in 
subsequent studies in this patient population. 
 16.312 Over  Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128724].  Anal yses involving over accrued 
patients is discussed in Section 16.44.  
 
16.32 Power and Signficance Level:  Assuming that the number of successes is 
binomially distributed, the significance level is .09, i.e. there is a 9% chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The probability of declaring 
that this regimen warrants further study (i.e. statistical power) under various 
success proportions can be tabulated as a function of the true success proportion 
as shown in the following table.  
 
If the true success proportion is...  .80 .85 .90 .95 
Then the probability  of declaring that the 
regimen warrants further study is…  .09 .27 .60 .93 
 
16.33 Other considerations:  Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate 
the study 
 
16.4   Analysis Plan  
 
16.41  Primary Outcome Analyses (Group 1) : 
MC078E 57 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017   
16.411  Definition:  The primary endpoint for the phase II portion of this trial is 
event-free survival at 12 months.  An event will be defined as death due 
to any cause, tumor progression or relapse (by [CONTACT_3610]), or initiation of subsequent anti -lymphoma therapy following R2CHOP study therapy. 
A patient will be considered a success if they are event -free at [ADDRESS_907636] begun treatment will be evaluable for event- free 
survival. 
 
16.412  Estimation:  The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_260780]. 
Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true rate of event -free 
survival at 12 months will be calculated.  
 
16.413 As of March 2012, the Kaplan- Meier estimate for event -free survival at 
12 months is 75% (95% CI: 61- 92%) in the f irst 32 evaluable patients 
included in the phase II portion.  Although this estimate is lower than we 
anticipated, there are several factors that warrant continuation of the 
expanded cohort: 
• There were 4/32 patients (13%) with primary mediastinal large B -
cell lymphoma, a subtype known to have shorter time to progression. 
 In the [ADDRESS_907637] year after 
registration, 2 of these occurred in patients with primary mediastinal 
disease.  Comparisons to RCHOP studies that di d not include 
patients with primary mediastinal disease may be misleading. Of note, primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma patients are excluded from study extension and no longer eligible. 
• Significant percentage (35%) of patients accrued to study was ove r 
60 years old with high or high- intermediate risk score according to 
International prognostic index (IPI). Advanced age and high IPI  [INVESTIGATOR_671746] -year EFS 
of 60% (Fuegier et al. J. of Clin. Oncol. 2005.23;18 pp -4117-4126).  
• Due to developments in imaging technology and the more frequent response evaluations that occur during observation (every 3 months for year 1 and every 4 months for year 2), it is possible that 
progressive disease is being discovered earlier than in studies where 
monitoring is done every 6 months or annually. This notion is further supported by [CONTACT_671765]. It is important to point out that as outlined 
in background section, that 2 year EFS is reported in previous studies 
of RCHOP is reported to be to be 55-60%.   
• RCHOP is the standard of care for DLBCL.  The addition of 
lenalidomide to RCHOP has not added s ignificant toxicities so there 
are no safety concerns in giving more patients this combination 
• Molecular classification of DLBCL by [CONTACT_671766] a potential prognostic factor that is emerging.  There is preliminary 
MC078E 58 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  evidence that the addition of lenalidomide to RCHOP may increase 
event- free survival in patients with the non -GCB subtype.  The 
expanded cohort will be used to investigate molecular classification.  
 
16.42 Secondary Outcome Analyses (to be evaluated in each group independently, 
unless s pecified otherwise)  
 16.421   Overall response rate:  The overall response rate will be estimated by [CONTACT_671767]. All evaluable patients will be 
used for this  analysis. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for 
the true overall response rate will be calculated.  
 
16.422   Overall CR rate:   The proportion of patients who achieve a CR will be 
estimated.  The overall CR rate will be estimated by [CONTACT_671768] a CR divided by [CONTACT_128773]. All evaluable patients will be used for this analysis. Exact 
binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall CR rate will 
be calculated.  
 16.423   Event- free survival: The ev ent-free survival (EFS) time is defined as the 
time from registration to progression, subsequent anti -lymphoma 
treatment, or death due to any cause. The distribution of EFS time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan- Meier (Kaplan and 
Meier 1958). 
 16.424   Overall survival:  Survival time is defined as the time from 
registration to death due to any cause. The distribution of survival 
time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan- Meier (Kaplan 
and Meier 1958). 
 16.425  Progression- free survival: T he progression- free survival (PFS) time 
is defined as the time from registration to progression or death due to any cause.  The distribution of progression- free survival will be 
estimated using the method of Kaplan- Meier (Kaplan and Meier 
1958).

achieved an objective response as the date at which the patient’s 
objective status is first noted to be either a CR or PR to the earliest 
date progression is documented. The distribution of duration of 
response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan- Meier 
(Kaplan and Meier 1958).  
 16.427   Analyses of translational endpoints:  Immune function will be 
evaluated before and after treatment by [CONTACT_58833] T, B, and NK cell quantification.  Changes in these values will be both graphically and 
quanitatively summarized and explored.  In addition, these values 
MC078E 59 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  will be explored in relation to clinical outcomes such as EFS and 
response (responder vs non -responder as well as by [CONTACT_671769], i.e. CR vs PR) . 
  16.428   R2CHOP in non- germinal center B- cell-like lymphoma  (Group 1 
only) 
 
DLBCL patients will be profiled for gene expression using pretreatment samples. Patients will be categorized as germinal- center 
B-cell-like (GCB) vs. non- germin al center B -cell-like (non- GCB).    
 In a previous study of large B- cell lymphoma treated with R -CHOP, 
patients with the non-GCB subtype had significantly worse overall survival and lower event-free survival than patients with the 
germinal -center B -cell-like subtype (Fu et al, 2008).  The 3- year 
event-free survival for the 63 patients with the non-GCB subtype 
was approximately 52%. Although event- free survival also includes 
initiation of subsequent anti- lymphoma therapy as an event for this 
study, it is rare to see a patient receive subsequent treatment before 
tumor progression or relapse.  A 3- year event -free survival of 50% 
would be a reasonable historical estimate for non -GCB subtype 
lymphoma treated with R- CHOP even where subsequent treatment is 
considered an event.  We are interesting in testing the null hypothesis that the 3 -year event- free survival for R2CHOP is 50% for DLBCL 
patients with the activated B -cell-like subtype. 
 Decision Rule  for DLBCL patients with activated B- cell-like 
lymphoma : The large st success proportion where the proposed 
treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population 
is 50%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant 
subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 70%. The following one- stage three-outcome design 
(Sargent et al, 2001) uses [ADDRESS_907639] 50%. Success is defined as being event- free at 
3 years, where an event is defined as death due to any cause, tumor 
progression or relapse (by [CONTACT_3610]), or initiation of subsequent anti -
lymphoma therapy following R2CHOP study therapy.  Assuming the number of successes is binomially distributed, the significance level 
is 0.05. 
 Final Decision Rule: The following decision criteria will be used in 
the evaluation of all 37 evaluable patients: • “Not promising”: This regimen will be classified as not promising 
with respect to the success rate in this patient population if at  most 
21 successes are observed in 37 evaluable 
patients.  
MC078E 60 MCCC Addendum 12 
 
Protocol Version Date:  30Nov 2017  • “Inconclusive”: The results of this study will be classified as 
inconclusive with respect to this regimen demonstrating an improved success rate if 22 or 23 successes are observed in 37  
evaluable patients. In this case, overall survival will be used in addition to event -free survival at 3 years to make the final decision 
as to whether or not this treatment is considered  
promising and worthy of further study in this patient population.  
• “Promising”: This regimen will be classified as promising with respect to increasing the success rate in this patient population if at 
least 24 successes are observed in 37 evaluable patients. Subsequent 
studies may be recommended.  
 
16.429   R2CHOP in transformed and composite follicular lymphoma (Group 
2) 
 
In a previous study including 53 patients with transformed follicular 
lymphoma treated with a ritixumab-containing chemotherapy, the 2-
year progression -free survival estimate was approximately 60% 
(Villa et al, 201 3).  We expect the addition of lenalidomide will 
increase the [ADDRESS_907640] a worse prognosis. Therefore, we are interesting in 
testing the null hypothesis that the 2-year progression- free survival 
for R2CHOP is 50% for patients with transformed or composite lymphoma. 
 Decision rule for patients with transformed and composite 
lymphoma:  The largest success proportion where the proposed 
treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population 
is 50%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant 
subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient 
population is 70%.  The following one- stage binomial design uses [ADDRESS_907641] 50%.  Success is defined as 
being alive and progression -free at 24 months. 
 Final Decision Rule:  If [ADDRESS_907642] 87% power, with a 9% Type I 
error rate.  
 
16.43   Adverse Events:  All eligible patients that have intitiated treatment will be

will be reviewed to determine patterns.  Additionally, the relationship of the 
adverse events to th e study treatment will be taken into consideration. 
 
16.44   Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_177062]; however, they will be included in final point 
estimates and confidence intervals.  
 
16.45    Data & Safety Monitoring: 
 
16.451  The principa l investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the 
study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and  any 
endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible 
for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_671770].

1 Protocol Summary 
 Study Compound:  RBM -007 
 Phase :  2 
 Study Objective :  To determine safety and efficacy of intravitreal injections of RBM -007 in 
subjects with  treatment naïve exudative AM D in the study eye. 
 Clinical Hypothesis :  RBM -007, as used in previous t rials of neovascular AMD, has shown an 
improvement in vision as well as an improvement in subretinal fibrosis in a cohort of subjects with chronic wet AMD.  The mechanism of action of RBM -[ADDRESS_1074813] -
proli feration .  Having both mechanisms of action active early in the disease process will reduce 
the development of fibrosis in naïve wet -AMD subjects and potentially provide an improved and 
sustained  visual function and favorable anatomic change.  
 Structure:  Single site , open label study 
 Duration:   4 months 
 Study Treatment group:  
• RBM -007 treatment at baseline, mon th 1and month 2.  Safety evaluations at week 2, 
months 3 and 4.  
  Randomization: all study subjects will receive study drug and those non-responsi ve to study drug 
will be treated with rescue anti -VEGF drug , in addition to continuing RBM-007 
 Visit Schedule:  There will be 6 scheduled visits during the study.  These include baseline (Day 0), week 2, and 
months 1, 2,3, 4/exit.  
 Primary endpoint one month after the last RBM -007 injection (month 3) 
 Study Population Characteristics  
 Number of subjects: Up to 5 subjects will be enrolled

rkm-011_protocol.docx /11 April 2021/page 6 2 Background and Clinical Rationale  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over 
the age of 65 in the [LOCATION_002] .1  The majority of severe vision loss due to advanced AMD is 
related to  the onset of choroidal neovascularization (CNV ). 2,[ADDRESS_1074815] a tendency to 
leak fluid and blood, causing retinal edema and central vision loss.    The CATT study data demonstrates that it is difficult to achieve anatomic flattening of the macula in patients with neovascular  AMD.
4  After one year of required monthly treatment in both the 
bevacizumab and ranibizumab groups, approximately 50% of subjects continued to have intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography .
4  When fluid is present in 
these structures , retreatment is generally necessary to stabilize vision – and subjects with persistent 
fluid generally have poorer visual gain.  RBM -007 has shown, in a previous clinical trial ( see 
attached SUSHI  Study CSR) evidence of bioactivity , reducing macular  edema associated with 
choroidal neovascularization in wet AMD.  Additionally, the mechanism of action of RBM -007 
is more expansive than that of Anti -VEGF treatment alone as RBM -007, a novel oligonucleotide-
based aptamer, has  potent anti -FGF2 activity,  which leads to reduced VEGF expression.5,6 In the 
rat and mouse models of laser -induced choroidal neovascularization, RBM -007 showed activity 
after intravitreal injection at doses as low as 5 μg/eye7. In the laser -induced choroidal 
neovascularization fibrosis model  in rats, it showed activity after intravitreal injection at doses as 
low as 15 μg/eye7 (see Ribomic Investigator Brochure for RBM -007, 2020).  
 
3 Study Objectives  
To determine safety and efficacy of intravitreal injections of RBM -007 in subjects with naïve 
exudative AMD.  
4 Study Design  
This study is a single -center, open label , 4-month study, designed to evaluate the safety and 
treatment efficacy  of RBM -007 in patients with intraretinal or subretinal edema due to previously 
untreated neovascular AMD.  Up to 5 subjects  will be randomized to receive study medication.  
Study treatment will be administered by [CONTACT_781776].   
 There will be 5 scheduled visits during the study.  See table 1.

7 Study Treatment  
RBM -007 injectable solutions  (20 mg/mL)  are filled (0.5 mL fill) in 2 -mL Type 1 Glass 
(borosilicate) clear  vials, capped with 13 mm Gray Butyl stoppers with B2- 40 coating (on top) and 
FluroTec coating  
(on bottom), and sealed. Three single use vial s will be placed in a carton, and the labeling will  
include protocol number, kit number, drug concentration and storage conditions.  RBM -007 
injectable solutions will be provided by [CONTACT_781777]/Representative and will be stored in an 
appropriate secure area at the investigational site. RBM -007 vials should be protected from light, 
stored upright, and kept at -20°C. 
 
7.1 Randomization :   
Not applicable for this open- label, single -treatment study.

a permanent marker, seal and s tore the bag in a secure area.  
 
7.3 Investigational drug: RBM-007:  
Loading the syringe 
1. A sterile, single -use 250 μL  syringe with several custom marking including 0.1 mL (100 μL) 
will be provided separately for IVT injection of RBM -007. Instructions for filling the syringe 
are as follows:  
2. Remove the sterile, single -use 250 μL syringe from the packaging.  
3. Attach a 19 -gaug e x 1 ½ inch filter needle to the syringe. RBM -007 is dispensed in a 0.5 mL 
fill in a 2 mL vial.  
4. Using sterile technique, carefully draw up approximately 200 μL of RBM -007 into the syringe. 
(Sufficiently larger volume than 100 μL is needed to allow for de ad space in syringe and 
needles prior to IVT injection). 
5. Remove the 19- gauge x 1½ inch filter needle from the syringe and replace with a 30 -gauge x 
0.5-inch needle for the IVT injection. 
6. Ensure that the 30-gauge x 0.5- inch needle is affixed tightly to the syringe.  
7. Align the top edge of the red O -ring of the plunger with the 100 μL black mark on the syringe, 
expelling the excess fluid drawn up. 
8. Ensure there are no air bubbles within the syringe or the needle hub prior to injection, and prior to expelling the  excess fluid drawn up. 
 
8 Safety Measures  
 Safety measures include the following: 
• adverse events  recording  
• BCVA  
• complete ophthalmic exam (consisting of an external examination of the eye, routine screening for eyelid/pupil responsiveness, confrontation visual field,  slit-lamp 
biomicroscopy, dilated fundus exam and IOP measurement)

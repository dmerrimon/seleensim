3.2 Statistical Basis for Sample Size 
Detailed information regarding the formal calculation of sample size can be 
found in the study protocol section 11.4. 
 
3.3 Randomization 
Upon completion of the randomization requirements specifications form, the 
randomization will be produced by [CONTACT_55410] (AZRand). For this study, a total of 24 patient identifiers will be randomly assigned to the treatment sequence(s): AB, BA, with 12 patients assigned per sequence. An additional set of replacement random numbers will be generated within AZRand on a like for like treatment sequence basis.   Randomization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially as patients become 
eligible for randomization (codes to be used without leading zero[s]). When using 
unique enrolment number, the specific format must be followed (i.e., reduced enrolment number, e.g., ” [for Baltimore] and ” [for Los Angeles] for outputs). The site number for Baltimore is  and the site number for Los Angeles is .  If a patient withdraws his/her participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomization code cannot be reused. If a replacement is mandated, replacement patients will receive a new randomization number and will be allocated to the same treatment sequence as the replaced patient. 
3.[ADDRESS_59926] to treatment (dapagliflozin or placebo) in each 
treatment period.  Dapagliflozin and placebo will be matched for formulation, appearance and amount. Patients randomized to placebo received the same number of tablets as patients on active drug.    &&, &&,

 CV%=SQRT[exp(s²)-1] x 100 and ‘s’ is the standard deviation of the log-transformed 
values.   The standard deviation of the geometric mean (GSD) will be displayed as: exp(lgmean +/- s), where 'lgmean' is the mean of the data on the log scale. For tmax and tlast, only n, median, minimum and maximum will be presented.  All PK tables, listings, and figures will be presented by [CONTACT_55415]:

x Treatment B: 9 mg RDEA3170 + 80 mg febuxostat 
 
For presentations in data listings, concentration data will be presented using the same number of significant figures as the data received from the bioanalytical laboratory.   For PK parameters, the listings will be presented according to the following rules:  
x Cmax – will be presented to the same number of significant figures as received 
from the bioanalytical laboratory. 
x tmax and tlast – will be presented as received in the data, usually to [ADDRESS_59945], only median, minimum, maximum, and n will be calculated.

7.1 Handling Of Values Below The Limit Of Quantification (BLQ)  
Individual plasma concentrations below the LLOQ of the bioanalytical assay will be 
listed as NQ (not quantifiable) with the LLOQ defined in the Tables, Figures and 
Listings (TFLs), as applicable.  For calculation of descriptive statistics, plasma concentrations that are NQ or if there are missing values (e.g., no result [NR]) will be handled as follows:  Where results are reported as ‘NR’, these will be set to missing in calculations of descriptive statistics.  
x At a time point where less than or equal to 50% of the values are NQ, all NQ 
values will be set to the LLOQ, and all descriptive statistics will be calculated. 
x At a time point where more than half (but not all) of the values are NQ, the mean, 
SD, geometric mean, geometric +GeoSD, geometric –GeoSD and CV% will be 
set to Not Calculated (NC).  The maximum value will be reported from the individual data, and the minimum and median will be set to NQ. 
x If all values are NQ at a time point, no descriptive statistics will be calculated for 
that time point.  Not calculated “NC” will be written in the field for SD, geometric 
+GeoSD, geometric –GeoSD and CV% and NQ will be written in fields for mean, geometric mean, minimum, median and maximum. 
x The number of NQ values (n below LLOQ) will be reported for each time point. 
 
Three observations > LLOQ are required as a minimum for a plasma concentration or PK parameter to be summarized.  Two values are presented as a minimum and maximum with the other summary statistics as NC. 
7.[ADDRESS_59947] profiles on linear and semi-logarithmic scale.  For each of the mean plasma concentrations profiles, error bars will be displayed as exp(lgmean +/- sd_lg), where 'lgmean' is the mean of the data on the log scale, and 'sd_lg' is the SD of the data on the log scale. Error bars will be excluded from mean figures on the log scale.  
For the mean figures and individual subject profiles, all treatments will be overlaid on 
the same plot, and seprate plot for each analyte. 
Nominal sampling times will be used in the PK concentrations summary tables and 
mean plasma concentration figures. Actual times from dosing will be used in the individual subject concentration -time profiles.    For mean plots, NQ values will be handled as described for the summary tabulations; 
for individual plots, plasma concentrations which are NQ before the first quantifiable 
concentration will be set to a value of zero (linear plots only).  After the first quantifiable concentration, any NQ plasma concentrations will be regarded as missing.  All plots will be based on the PK analysis set, with the exception of 
individual plots by [CONTACT_55416]. 
7.[ADDRESS_59948] and Roger's method will be used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effects (DDFM=KR).  The 
point estimate and 90% CI for the difference between treatments (RDEA3170 + 
febuxostat + dapagliflozin versus RDEA3170 + febuxostat) will be constructed.  The point estimate and adjusted 90% CIs will be exponentially back transformed to

 provide point and CI estimates for the treatment ratio (RDEA3170 + febuxostat + 
dapagliflozin versus RDEA3170 + febuxostat).  Additionally, for each treatment, back transformed geometric means together with 95% CIs for AUC Ĳ, AUClast
 and Cmax, 
for RDEA3170, M1, M8, and febuxostat will be estimated and presented.  To make the treatment comparison the following SAS code maybe used as reference:   PROC MIXED data = data ; 
CLASS subject treatment period sequence; 
MODEL log( var) = treatment period sequence ; 
RANDOM  subject(sequence) ; LSMEAN treatment /  CL ALPHA=0.05 ; ESTIMATE 'A vs. B' treatment 1 -1  / ALPHA=0.1 CL; RUN;  For all ANOVA PK models described above the geometric mean ratios, their 90% CI, along with the ratios of individual patient values will be plotted to visualize the treatment comparisons. 
7.6 Multiplicity  
Since there is only one primary hypothesis on pharmacokinetics there is no need for a 
multiplicity adjustment. 
8. Pharmacodynamic Results 
8.1 Primary PD Variables  
PD urine collection times will be provided including the derived sampling time 
deviations.  From the uric acid concentrations the urinary excretion of uric acid will 
be derived as follows: 
   
x Amount Excreted = urine acid concentration * weight of produced urine * 
1.000 
 The primary outcome variable,  the ‘Peak uric acid excretion during the first 8 hours’, will be identified as the maximum amount excreted in an interval out of the first [ADDRESS_59949] listings will be provided of the raw uric acid concentrations and the derived values for the urinary excretion of uric acid. Among the Day -1 and Day 7 timepoints tabulated below, the peak (maximum) uric acid excretion will be flagged in the data listing.  
 
The maximum change from baseline in the amount excreted in urine for each period 
will be derived as the difference between the peak amount excreted during Day [ADDRESS_59950] 8 hours of 
assessment  -23 to -22 hours 1 to 2 hours 
-22 to -21 hours 2 to 3 hours 
-21 to -20 hours 3 to 4 hours

 For each subject the derived values for the maximum change from baseline in the amount excreted in urine for each period will be listed.  Descriptive summary tables will be provided for the raw uric acid concentrations, the derived values for the urinary excretion of uric acid, the peak uric acid excretions, as well as the change from baseline of the peak uric acid excretions.  Subject profiles will be used to visualize the derived values for the urinary excretion 
of uric acid for each treatment over time. Side-by-side box plots will be used to 
visualize the distribution of the peak uric acid excretions at Day -[ADDRESS_59951] listings will be provided for the raw serum uric acid concentrations. The 
serum uric acid results will be analyzed for each period as the Day 7 predose assessment compared to the Day -1 assessment using change from baseline (Day 7 
predose versus Day -1). Change from baseline values will be listed for each subject.

8.[ADDRESS_59953] 8 hours. Analysis of the primary variable will be done on log-transformed values. Using the peak uric acid excretion the analysis will consider the maximum change from baseline difference from placebo at day 7 of treatment. The maximum change from baseline is the change from baseline (Day 7 versus Day -1) in the peak uric acid excretion where the  baseline is the peak urine excretion observed over the first 8 hours of Day -1. A linear mixed effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) model will be used, with fixed effects terms for sequence, period, and treatment. In this analysis, subjects nested within sequence will be assumed to be a random effect.  Kenward and Roger's method will be used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effects (DDFM=KR). A geometric 
mean ratio for the change from baseline response will be calculated by [CONTACT_55418]-logarithm of the difference between treatment means.  A 95% CI for each treatment ratio will be obtained by [CONTACT_43101]-logarithm of the 95% CI endpoints

change from baseline difference from placebo including 95% Cis for the mean ratios, based on Student’s t-distribution.   
8.3.[ADDRESS_59954] is the serum uric acid (sUA) levels on Day 7. 
Analysis of serum UA will be conducted in an equivalent way as urine UA, using 
log-transformed values and change from baseline (Day -1) to observed serum UA at 
Day 7.  A linear mixed effect model of the change from baseline will be used with fixed effects terms for sequence, period, and treatment. In this analysis, subjects nested within sequence will be assumed to be a random effect.  Kenward and Roger's method will be used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effects (DDFM=KR). Results will be presented in the same way as the results for urine UA: using the geometric mean ratios for the change from baseline difference from placebo including 95% Cis for the mean ratios.    Statistical analysis of the other secondary PD variables will be conducted in an equivalent way as described for serum and urine UA.

 8.3.5 Analysis of Urinary PD Variables Over a 24 hour Interval  
Using the amount excreted in urinary uric acid, derived as: 
x Amount Excreted = urine uric acid concentration * weight of produced urine 
* 1.000 
 For each 24 hour profile (Day -1 and Day 7 ), the amount excreted for each individual 
time point will be summed over each [ADDRESS_59955] this will 
provide a total value for each period for each day defined as: the ‘Total Amount of Uric Acid Excreted in Urine over a 24 hour period (mg/day)’.    Similar calculations will be applied to the other quantitative urinalysis PD parameters: Sodium, Creatinine, Cystatin-C, and pH.  For each of these secondary urine PD parameters, the amount excreted will be listed and the total amount excreted in urine over a 24 hour period will be listed. These total values derived over a 24 hour period will be summarize by [CONTACT_55419].   
9. Safety Analysis 
The analysis of the safety variables will be conducted using the safety analysis set. 
9.1 Adverse Events 
 
All verbatim AE terms reported will be coded according to MedDRA, version 20.1. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset (start date/time) after the first dose of IMP in Treatment period 1.  Adverse events will be assigned to a treatment based on the start date/time of the AE in relation to dosing in that period; for tabulation purposes the AE will then be 
assigned to the treatment received in the respective treatment period as follows: 
 
x Screening: all AEs with start date/time before dosing in Treatment period 1. 
x Treatment period 1: AEs with start date/time at the time of or after dosing in 
Treatment period 1 until the time of dosing in Treatment period 2 will be assigned 
to the treatment received in period 1. 
x Treatment period 2: AEs with start date/time at the time of or after dosing in 
Treatment period 2 until the Follow-up Visit, will be assigned to the treatment 
received in period 2. 
 Adverse events with missing start dates/times will be handled as follows: 
x If the start date is completely missing but the end date is known and shows that 
the AE ended on or after the first dose date, then the start date will be imputed as 
the first day of dosing; if the end date is known and shows that the AE ended 
PAREXEL International 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
[COMPANY_008] AB 
Protocol D5495C00001  
 Version 1.[ADDRESS_59956] dose date, then the screening date will be used for the start date.  If 
the end date is non-informative (i.e., is missing or does not contain enough information), the start date will be imputed as the first date of dosing; 
x If only the start day is missing the day will be imputed as the first day on which a 
dose was given in that month unless the end date is known and shows that the AE 
ended before a dose was given in that month; in which case the date will be imputed as 01.  If the end date is non-informative (i.e., is missing or does not contain enough information), the start date will be imputed as the first date of 
dosing in the known month.  If the month is not a dosing month the date will be 
imputed as 01; 
x If the start day and month are missing the date will be imputed as the first day of 
dosing in the known year unless the end date is known and shows that the AE 
ended before a dose was given in that year; in which case the start day and month will be imputed as 01Jan or with the date of screening if this is later.  If the end date is non-informative (i.e., is missing or does not contain enough information), the start date will be imputed as the first date of dosing in the known year.  If the year is not a year of dosing, then the date will be imputed as 01Jan or with the date of screening if this is later. 
 Missing times will be imputed as 00:[ADDRESS_59957] (Listing [IP_ADDRESS]). All serious AEs (SAEs) will be listed (Listing [IP_ADDRESS]). A listing of all AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will be presented, if applicable (Listing [IP_ADDRESS]).   The following information will be included in the listings: verbatim term, SOC, Preferred Term and lowest level term, start date/time, end date/time, time from most recent dose, causality, action taken, whether the AE was classified as serious and the outcome.  Unless specified otherwise, all adverse event summaries will include the TEAEs only and adverse event summary counts of AEs will be the number of subjects reporting 
adverse events and not the number of events reported. The number and percentage of 
subjects with adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_55420]. A subject with multiple adverse events within a body system is only counted once towards the total of that body system.  If the same AE (preferred term) is reported several times for the same subject within a treatment period, it will only appear once for that specified treatment in the summary tables.  For purposes of the summary tables, AEs will be classified as either being related to study drug or not related.  
As defined in the protocol, within the source data all AEs will be assigned a severity 
grade of: Mild, Moderate, Severe. For subjects with multiple adverse events of the 
same preferred term and of different severities, the AE with the highest assessment of 
severity will be used in the summaries presented by [CONTACT_926].

 A general summary of all treatment-emergent adverse events will show the number 
and percentage of subjects, as well as the number of events, according to the following categories: 
x All treatment emergent adverse events  
x Treatment emergent adverse events ‘Related to IMP’ 
x Mild treatment emergent adverse events 
x Moderate treatment emergent adverse events 
x Severe treatment emergent adverse events 
x Treatment emergent adverse events leading to death 
x Serious treatment emergent adverse events 
x Treatment emergent adverse events leading to early termination 
 
Other summary tables for adverse events will include:

‘Not Related to the IMP’ by [CONTACT_1196], Preferred Term, Severity, and 
Treatment. 
x Number and Percentage of Subjects with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events by 
[CONTACT_55421]; for those subjects assigned to the ‘AB’ treatment 
sequence, any AE occurring during the first period and before the Period 2 dose, will be assigned to the ‘A’ treatment (9 mg RDEA3170 + 80 mg febuxostat + 10 mg dapagliflozin). Any AE occurring after the period 2 dose, will be assigned to the ‘B’ treatment (9 mg RDEA3170 + 80 mg febuxostat + placebo).  
 
For those subjects assigned to the ‘BA’ sequence, any AE occurring during the first period and before the period 2 dose, will be assigned to the ‘B’ treatment (9 mg RDEA3170 + 80 mg febuxostat + placebo). Any AE occurring after the period 2 dose, will be assigned to the ‘A’ treatment (9 mg RDEA3170 + 80 mg febuxostat + 10 mg dapagliflozin).   
If a subject has multiple AEs with the same preferred term but occurring after each 
dose administration, then one AE will be counted for each treatment.  Adverse events that emerge in one treatment period and carry over into the next period will be attributed to only the period in which the AE emerged.

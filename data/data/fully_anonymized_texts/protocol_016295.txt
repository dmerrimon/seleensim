Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  1.0 Background    
1.1 Oropharynx Cancer: Current State of Practice and Purpose of this Trial 
 
Several treatment modalities are availabl e for patients with oropharyngeal cancer, 
including definitive surgery, definitive ra diotherapy, and chemoradiation.  After 
definitive surgery, certain factors place patient s at increased risk fo r disease recurrence.  
These patients receive either adjuvant radiot herapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.  
Advances in both systemic and radiation th erapy in the adjuvant setting have been 
associated with improved survival and local control.    
Adjuvant treatment comes at the cost of increased  acute and late toxicity.  Furthermore, it 
is unclear if recent improvements in outcome can be completely attributed to the 
aggressiveness of adjuvant care.  The recent rise in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers associated with human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) have prompted a re-evaluation of 
past trial outcomes.  HPV associated orophary ngeal cancers have been demonstrated to 
be more chemo and radiation sensitive comp ared to non-HPV related tumors.  Large 
phase II/III studies which evaluate less morb id treatment approaches for definitive 
chemoradiation in HPV-associated patients ar e currently ongoing.  However, clinical 
trials designed for patients in the post-surgical setting are lacking.    The overall goal of this trial is to identif y a less toxic approach to HPV-associated 
cancers of the oropharynx while preserving the high survival currently associated with 
aggressive adjuvant radiation courses.  We fi rst aim to demonstrate the feasibility of a 
novel adjuvant therapy course using low- dose, hyperfractionated radiation with 
concurrent docetaxel.  We also aim to  show that low-dose, hyperfractionated 
chemoradiation will substantially reduce the burden of acute toxicity, result in faster 
recovery, carry lower rates of late effects, with similar rates of long-term survivorship 
compared with historical results from standard adjuvant care. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_566149] from HPV-negative cancers in regards to risk factor profiles, molecula r characteristics, treatment response, and 
prognosis.  In a meta-analysis of retrospective studies, HPV-associated oropharynx 
cancer had an estimated 50% reduction in risk of death when compared to patients with HPV-negative tumors.  (
Dayyani F, Etzel CJ, Liu M , et al. )  This may be due to the fact that 
HPV-associated tumors are more responsive to  chemotherapy and radiation.  In an ECOG 
trial prospectively evaluating the effect of tumor HPV status, HPV-associated tumors were found to have a higher response rate to induction paclitaxel and carboplatin when 
compared to HPV-negative tumors. (
Fakhry C, Westra WH, Li S , et al. )  Similarly, an 
analysis on survival outcomes in RTOG 0129,  a randomized trial where patients received 
accelerated versus standard fraction radiotherapy, patients who were HPV-associated had 
a 51% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to HPV-negative patients.  
Among HPV-associated patients, there is a further stratification of outcome based upon smoking status.  In a further sub-group analysis of RTOG 0129, HPV-associated patients who had <[ADDRESS_566150] a 3 year OS of 93% 
compared with a 70.8% OS among HPV-asso ciated patients with a >10 pack-year 
smoking history.  (

now a highly relevant clinical question.   
 
1.3 Adjuvant Radiation Therapy: Risk factors and Dose  
  
Previous retrospective trials have highlighted risk factors that place patients at increased 
risk for local recurrence and death after definitive surgery.  (
Lundahl RE, Foote RL, Bonner 
JA, et al. )  These risk factors include positive marg ins, extracapsular extension of tumor 
from a lymph node (ECE), number of involved lymph nodes, lymph nodes larger than 3 cm, lymphvascular space invasion (LVSI), close margins, and perineural invasion (PNI).    For patients with positive margins or extracapsu lar extension, adjuva nt radiation therapy 
plus concurrent cisplatin has historically been the standard of care.  These risk factors 
were identified as high risk on a meta-analy sis of the two largest randomized trials 
addressing adjuvant radiotherapy  (RTOG 9501 and EORTC [ZIP_CODE].)  (
Bernier J, Cooper JS, 
Pajak TF , et al.)   In this analysis, patients with ECE or positive margins had a benefit to 
local control and overall survival from high dose chemoradiation.  In this joint analysis, 
however, the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy did not improve overall 
survival in patients with intermediate risk f actors such as 2+ lymph nodes, PNI, LVSI, or 
Stage III-IV disease.   
 The optimal implementation of adjuvant radi otherapy in patients with only intermediate 
risk factors is less clear.  Only one pr ospective randomized trial opened in [ADDRESS_566152]-operative radiation dose for these patients. (Kokal WA, Neifeld JP, 
Eisert D, et al.)  This study was limited by [CONTACT_445174] (
60Co 
machines) in a patient era that was pre-HPV.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_141859], the control rate 
for the neck in patients with intermediate risk factors was 89% with doses between 52.2-
54.[ADDRESS_566153] of care for adjuvant radiation alone is a dose of 60-66 Gy.  This is based upon the control arm of the EORTC/RTOG trials, not prospective data.   
 The use of ECE as a high risk factor for adjuvant  therapy is also unclear in the HPV era.  
Both RTOG 9501 and EORTC [ZIP_CODE] were conducted in an era where oropharynx cancer was mostly secondary to smoking and alcohol, rather than HPV.  A recent large, multi-institutional retrospective analysis on HPV-associated patients, for example, 
demonstrated that ECE was a poor predicto r of disease recurrence after surgery in the 
MC1273 
 7  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  modern era (Lewis JS, Carpenter DH, Thorstad  WL, et al.)  These data have been the 
foundation for the ADEPT trial, an ongoing treatment de-escalation trial for post-
surgical, HPV-associated patients with positi ve ECE.  However, the treatment de-
escalation in ADEPT is restricted to chemot herapy (radiotherapy plus/minus cisplatin) 
and does not the address the question of radiation de-escalation.

a patient’s quality of life.  When lookin g at acute reactions on EORTC [ZIP_CODE], adjuvant 
radiation alone was associated with a 21% rate  of severe, grade 3+ mucositis, a 20% risk 
of severe xerostomia, and a 5% risk of grade 3+ muscular fibrosis.  These acute reactions also translated into late complications.  The rate of late, severe xerostomia was 22% 
while the rate of severe muscular fibrosis was 5%.  Similar numbers were also seen in RTOG 9501.  In this trial, 34% of patients r eceiving adjuvant radiotherapy alone had an 
acute adverse effect of grade 3 or higher wh ile 17% of the radiotherapy alone group had 
severe late adverse effects.    The etiology of these acute and late complications is well known. Radiation 
complications are related both to the total dose received by [CONTACT_445175], and the 
size of each individual radiation fraction.  The radiation dose limits for a variety of 
normal tissues within the head and neck have been previously documented.  For example, 
a mean radiation dose of 26 Gy to a parotid gland has a 20% risk of rendering the organ 
non-functional, while a mean dose of 50 Gy to the pharyngeal constrictors carries a 20% 
risk of long-term dysphagia and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  (
Eisbruch A, Ten Haken RK, Kim HM , et al.)  
(Blanco AI, Chao KS, El Naqa I , et al. )  (Kuhnt T, Jirsak N, Muller AC , et al.)  (Levendag PC,

structures directly abut against areas standardly treated to [ADDRESS_566155] on patient quality of life. 
 
 
1.5 Preliminary Data: Increased treatment sensitivity of HPV+ tumors 
 
Cell and animal studies have detailed the incr eased sensitivity of HPV-associated tumors 
to both radiation and chemotherapy.  Cell lines containing E6 isoforms associated with 
HPV have an eightfold reduction in survivin g cells fraction after receiving 10 Gy of 
radiation when compared to cell lines containing non-HPV related isoforms.  ( Pang E, 
Delic NC, Hong A , et al. )  In vitro studies of HPV-associated tumors implanted within 
immunocompetent mice have demonstrated complete clearance of tumor with 20 Gy of treatment while the HPV-negative counterparts demonstrated persistent growth after 20 
Gy.  The sensitivity of HPV-associat ed tumors was also seen with cisplatin in this study.   
Cisplatin in vivo cleared HPV-associated tumors but not HPV-negative tumors.  (Pradier O, Rave-Frank M, Lehmann J , et al. )
  Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that 
patients with HPV-associated  tumors do not require as much chemotherapy nor radiotherapy for complete disease clearance.

Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  1.6 Selection of Chemoradiation Dose   The doses and schedule for chemoradiation we re chosen based upon the results of prior 
and current multi-institutional studies.  Docetaxel at 15 mg/m2 was used as part of a radiosensitizing regimen in RTOG [ADDRESS_566156] when compared  with cisplatin.  (Le QT, Raben D.  et al.)  
 The radiation dose of 30-[ADDRESS_566157] and current  multi-institutional clinical trials.  Using

yields that 30 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions is equivalent to 34.5 Gy 10. (Hall EJ, Giaccia AJ., et 
al.)  
 
Concerning HPV-status, ECOG [ADDRESS_566158] of care for treating definitive oropharyngeal cancers is 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (84 Gy
10) with concurrent 
cisplatin.  On ECOG 1308, patients receive induction chemotherapy followed by 54 Gy 
in 2 Gy fractions (64.8 Gy 10) with concurrent cetuximab.  (Peres J.)  This translates into a 
23% dose reduction in chemoradiation compar ed with standard of care due to HPV-
positivity.  Concerning accelerated radiation, a multi-institutional trial run by [CONTACT_161615] (9502b) used 39 Gy in 1.5 Gy b.i.d. fractions (44.85 Gy
10) for microscopic 
disease while the standard dose for microscopic disease is 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions 
(63.72 Gy 10.)  (Haraf DJ, Rosen FR, Stenson K, et al. )  This translates into a 29% dose 
reduction compared with standard of care due to treatment acceleration. 
 
Combining the dose reduction due to HPV-pos itivity and treatment acceleration yields a 
dose reduction of 52% compared to standard of care.  A dose reduction of 52% on the 
standard of care dose of 60 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (72 Gy 10) is equal to 34.56 Gy 10, a figure 
essentially equivalent to 30 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions bid.

7.41 Technical Factors 
Treatment Planning/Delivery : Megavoltage energy photon beam irradiation is 
required. Any treatment planning and delivery system that has been credentialed for head and neck IMRT is acceptable. 
7.42 Image Guidance for IGRT : Daily image guidance of IMRT may be achieved 
using any one or more of the following techniques: 
 Orthogonal kilovoltage (KV) images, e.g. ExacTrac; 
 Linear-accelerator mounted kV and MV conebeam CT images; 
 
The institution’s procedure to register treatment day imaging dataset with the 
reference dataset should comply with the following recommendations: 
MC1273 
 19  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017   Region-of-Interest (ROI) or “clip box” fo r fusion should be set to encompass 
the high dose PTV and adjacent spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] ; if the supraclavicular region is a 
part of the target volume the ROI should extend to the C6 level; 
 If the fusion software allows the user to create an irregular ROI (e.g., ExacTrac), treatment room objects seen on in-room X-rays should be excluded from the registration; 
 Both manual (e.g., based on bony anatomy) and automatic (e.g., based on mutual information) types of registration can be used; the result of the fusion 
must be visually checked for the ali gnment of the bony anatomy, such as 
vertebral bodies and applicable soft tissue structures (e.g., optic nerves and/or 
optic chiasm). 
 Following the registration, the translationa l and (if the appropriate technology is 
available) rotational corrections should be applied to the treatment couch. If all the 
variances are less than 2.5 mm (this typi[INVESTIGATOR_445152]), the treatment can proceed without correction (however, the physician/team may 
elect to perform adjustments even for a va riance < 2.5 mm). If one or more corrections 
are 2.5-5 mm, adjustment is necessary prior to treatment; however, re-imaging is not mandatory. If one or more of the corrections are larger than [ADDRESS_566186] be 
repeated in addition to performing table/positioning adjustments.

 7.5 Target and Normal Tissue Volume Definitions 
 
7.51 Definition of Target Volumes 
 
7.510 CTV_HIGH: This volume will receive 1.[ADDRESS_566189]. Daniel J. Ma. 
 7.511 CTV_LOW: This volume will receive 1.5 Gy per day bid. CTV will 
include the primary tumor bed (based on preoperative imaging, preoperative physical exam/endosc opy, operative findings, pathologic 
findings) plus region(s) of grossly involved lymphadenopathy. This volume may approach the skin but should not approach < 2mm. It is recognized that after surgery, there can be considerable distortion of 
MC1273 
 20  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  normal anatomy. If possible, map preoperative GTV(s) onto the postoperative radiation therapy pla nning CT scan, and add appropriate 
margins for microscopic spread (1.5-2  cm).  CTV also will include the 
bilateral necks.  This generally means encompassing nodal levels 2a, 3, 
and [ADDRESS_566190]. Daniel J. Ma.   
 7.512  Planning Target Volumes (PTVs): In general, the PTV should not go outside of the skin surface; if it does exceed the skin surface, the 
application of bolus material over this portion of the PTV may be 
considered but is generally not recommended.  
 
7.513  PTV Expansion With Daily IGRT 
The minimum CTV-to-PTV expansion is 2.5 mm (a larger expansion 
may be necessary for a target volume subject to significant intra-fraction 
variability.  In general, the CTV- to-PTV expansion (with IGRT) should 
not exceed 5 mm. 
 
7.52 Definition of Normal Tissues/Organs at Risk (OARs) 
 
7.[ADDRESS_566191]: The cord begins at the cranial-cervical junction (i.e., the top 
of the C1 vertebral body). Superior to this is brainstem and inferior to this is cord. The inferior border of th e spi[INVESTIGATOR_357319] T3-
4 (i.e., just below the lowest slice level that has PTV on it). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_306396]. In 
addition, however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) spi[INVESTIGATOR_445153]. The PRVcord = cord + 5 mm in each dimension. This is irrespective of whether or not IGRT is used. 
 7.522  Brainstem: The inferior most portion of the brainstem is at the cranial-cervical junction where it meets the sp inal cord. For the purposes of this 
study, the superior most portion of the brainstem is approximately at the level of the top of the posterior cli noid. The brainstem shall be defined 
based on the treatment planning CT scan. In addition, however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) brainstem shall be defined. The PRVbrainstem = brainstem + 3 mm in each dimension. 
 7.523  Lips and Oral Cavity: These should be contoured as 2 separate structures as the goal is to keep the lip dose mu ch lower than the oral cavity dose. 
The definition of lips is self-explanatory. For non-oral cavity cancers, the oral cavity will be defined as a composite structure consisting of the 
anterior ½ to 2/3 of the oral tongue /floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and 
palate. For oral cavity cancers, the oral cavity will be defined as the 
subset of this composite structure that does not overlap with PTV. 
 
MC1273 
 21  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  7.524  Parotid Glands: Parotid glands will be defined based on the treatment planning CT scan.  Parotid gland volu me will not include any portion of 
any of the CTVs, although they can overlap the PTVs. 
 7.526  OARpharynx: This will be defined as the “uninvolved” posterior pharyngeal wall plus adjacent constrictor muscles. This extends from the 
superior constrictor region (the infe rior pterygoid plates level) to the 
cricopharyngeal inlet (posterior cric oid cartilage level). This should not 
overlap the PTVs. 
 
7.527  Cervical Esophagus: This will be defined as a tubular structure that starts 
at the bottom of OARpharynx and extends to the thoracic inlet. 
 
7.528  Glottic/Supraglottic Larynx (GSL): Obvi ously, for patients who have had 
a total laryngectomy, this structure is  not applicable. This will be defined 
as a “triangular prism shaped” volume that begins just inferior to the 
hyoid bone and extends to the cric oid cartilage inferiorly and extends 
from the anterior commissure to include  the arytenoids. This includes the 
infrahyoid but not suprahyoid epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050]. 
 
7.529a Mandible: This includes the entire boney structure of the mandible from 
TMJ through the symphysis. It is recognized that for oral cavity cancers, 
this may overlap with CTVs and PTVs. 
 
7.529b Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets: This will be defined as tissue 
located between the skull base and thor acic inlet that is not included in 
either the target volumes or the normal tissues described above. 
 
7.6 Treatment Planning and Delivery 
 
7.61  Management of the Low Neck/Supr aclavicular Region (No Match) 
No Match: The entire clinical target volume (CTV) [upper and lower neck and 
primary tumor bed] is irradiated with IMRT. There is no match line between 
upper and lower portions of the regions at risk. In this technique, limiting 
radiotherapy dose to organs at risk (OARs), e.g., the cervical esophagus, is entirely achieved by [CONTACT_445181].  
 
7.62  IMRT Dose Prescription to PTVs 
See Section 6.4.1 for definitions of CTVs and PTVs. As described in Section 6.1, 
prescribed radiotherapy dose will be 30-36 Gy in 1.5-1.8 Gy twice-daily fraction 
size. For inverse planning IMRT, the goal is for 100% of the PTV_LOW to receive ≥ 1.5 Gy / fraction.  It is recognized that portions of the PTV_LOW close 
to the skin may receive significantly l ess than [ADDRESS_566192] at  a depth deeper than 8 mm beneath the 
skin (see Section 6.7, compliance criteria).  At least 98% of PTV_HIGH should receive at least 1.8 Gy / fraction.  For prioritization, PTVs will be the highest priority target structure.  
 
7.63  IMRT Dose Constraints to Normal Structures 
MC1273 
 22  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, [ADDRESS_566193] : The PRVcord (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) should not 
exceed 35 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_445154] 30 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.01 cc.  
 7.632  Brainstem : The PRVbrainstem (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) should not 
exceed 35 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm).  
 7.634  Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possibl e. The mean dose should be < 
15 Gy.  
 
7.635  Oral Cavity: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose 
should be < 20 Gy. 
 
7.636  Parotid Glands : In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than 
the other. The treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid 
gland to receive a mean dose of < 10 Gy. Otherwise, the goal will be for 
the total mean parotid dose to be < 15 Gy. 
 7.637  Submandibular Glands:   If either submandibular gland is outside of the 
target volume, the goal will be for a mean dose for that gland to be <20 Gy.  Otherwise reduce the dose as much as possible. 
7.637  OARpharynx : Reduce the dose as much as possible.  
 7.638  Cervical Esophagus : Reduce the dose as much as possible.  
 7.639a  Glottic and Supraglottic larynx (GSL) : Reduce the dose as much as 
possible.  
 7.639b  Mandible: Reduce the dose as much as possible.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_566194] along with the 
reason(s) for the treatment break(s). Radiation breaks, if necessary, should not exceed one treatment day. Radiation breaks should be  allowed only for resolution of severe acute 
toxicity and/or for intercurrent illness and not for social or logistical reasons. Any 
radiation break(s) exceeding one treatment day for reasons other than toxicity/illness will 
be considered a major protocol deviation.

prophylactic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placeme nt is highly recommended. Placement of a 
feeding tube should be recorded on the a ppropriate case report form, as should use of a 
feeding tube during and after treatment (e.g., greater than or less than 50% of nutrition by [CONTACT_181616]).   Other common radiation adverse events incl ude: fatigue, weight loss, regional alopecia, 
xerostomia, hoarseness, transient ear discomfort, dysgeusia, and skin erythema and desquamation within the treatment fields.  Less common long-term treatment adverse events include: hypothyroidism, loss of hearing, chronic swallowing dysfunction re quiring permanent feeding tube, and cervical 
fibrosis.  
 
Much less common radiation adverse events include: mandibular osteoradionecrosis (< 5% incidence with attentio n to dental recommendations), and cervical myelopathy (<

Next, determine whether the event is e xpected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3).  With this information, determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Secti on 10.4).  Important: Expedited adverse 
event reporting requires submission of a MedWatch report(s). Expedited reports 
are to be completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in 
MC1273 
 26  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, [ADDRESS_566209] also be reported 
via the routine data reporting mechanisms  defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections

 10.[ADDRESS_566210] Level Term (LLT).  Grade is an esse ntial element of the Guidelines and, in 
general, relates to severity  for the purposes of regulatory reporting to NCI. 
  
NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT  the same 
as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected  
 
 The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on the agent-specific information provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol. 
 
 Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent-specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol. 
 NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is 
neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). 
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.

 10.5 Other Required Reporting 
 
10.51 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities 
 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital abnormities or birth 
defects, must be reported immediately if they occur at any time following treatment with an 
agent under an IND/IDE since they are considered to be a serious AE and must be reported to the 
sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_566214] dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours.  Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
 
Reportable categories of Death   
 
 Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
 
 Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_15929] 28 days of life. 
 
 Death NOS:  A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
 
MC1273 
 29  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017   Sudden death NOS:  A sudden (d efined as instant or within 
one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5. 
 
 Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 
5 “Neoplasms benign, maligna nt and unspecified (incl 
cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the 
system organ class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted. 
 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
 
 A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not 
considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
 
 All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an IND/IDE be reported. Three options are available to describe the event: 
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML]) 
 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
 
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting 
mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
10.54 Second Malignancy 
 
 A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy 
(and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second 
malignancies require ONLY routine reporting.

14.4 Background and Methodology 
  
14.41 Circulating Cell Free DNA (cfDNA): Several studies indicate that circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) includes representation of key genetic alterations related to cancer progression or resistance to systemic therapy; these alterations 
include mutations of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53 ) and oncogenes (e.g., 
PIK3CA, KRAS and BRAF ). Commercially available platforms exist with a 
predefined set of genes and point mutations of interest for use across multiple 
malignancies. A more flexible system for individualized monitoring is needed. 
Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster has developed an internal assay for this purpose.  
 
 
 

MC1273 35  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017   15.0 Drug Information  
 
15.1 Docetaxel (Taxotere®, TATER) Commercial Supply 
 
15.11 Background: Antineoplastic Agent, Antimicrotubular, Taxane derivative. 
Docetaxel promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers, and inhibits the depolymerization of tubulin which stabilizes microtubules in the cell. This results in inhibition of DNA, RNA,  and protein synthesis. Most activity 
occurs during the M phase of the cell cycle. 
 
15.12 Formulation: Note: Docetaxel is now available as a one-vial formulation in two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. The older formulation included 2 vials 
which consisted of a concentrated docetaxel  vial and a diluent vial, resulting in a 
reconstituted concentration of 10 mg/mL. Admixture errors could occur due to the concentration difference between the new formulations of 10 mg/mL and 20 
mg/mL and the old formulation (10 mg/mL). Do not use the two-vial formulation with the one-vial formulation for the same admixture product. 
 
15.13 Drug procurement: 
 
Preparation, storage, and stability : Storage conditions:
  Store the packaged 
docetaxel between 2 and 25 C (36 and 77 F).  Retain in the original package to 
protect from bright light. Freezing does not adversely affect the product. 
 
One-vial formulation: Note: One-vial formulation is available in two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. Further reconstitution with diluent is 
not required. Further dilute for infusion in 250-500 mL of NS or D 5W in a non-
DEHP container (e.g., glass, polypropylene, polyolefin) to a final concentration of 0.3-0.74 mg/mL. Gently rotate to mix thoroughly. Solutions prepared from the one-vial formulation and diluted for infu sion should be used within 4 hours of 
preparation (infusion should be  completed within 4 hours). 
 Two-vial formulation:  Vials should be diluted with 13% (w/w) ethanol/water 
(provided with the drug) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Do not shake. Further dilute for infusion in 250-500 mL of NS or D
5W in a non-DEHP 
container (e.g., glass, polypropylene, polyolefin) to a final concentration of 0.3-0.74 mg/mL. Gently rotate to mix thorou ghly. Diluted solutions of the two-vial 
formulation are stable in the vial for 8 hours at room temperature or under 
refrigeration. Solutions prepared with th e two-vial formulation and diluted for 
infusion in D
5W or NS are stable for up to 4 weeks (Thiesen, 1999) at room 
temperature of 15ºC to 25ºC (59ºF to 77ºF) in polyolefin containers; however, the 
manufacturer recommends use within 4 hours (infusion should be completed within 4 hours).  
15.14 Administration:   Administer IV infusion over 1-hour through nonsorbing 
polyethylene lined (non-DEHP) tubi ng; in-line filter is not necessary. Note: 
Premedication with dexamethasone 8 – 10 mg orally twice daily for 3-5 days, 
beginning the day before docetaxel administration is recommended to decrease the incidence and severity of fluid retention and prevent hypersensitivity 
reactions and pulmonary/peripheral edema.  When administered as sequential 
MC1273 36  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  infusions, taxane derivatives should be admi nistered before platinum derivatives 
(cisplatin, carboplatin) to limit myel osuppression and to enhance efficacy.  
  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : Docetaxel exhibits linear 
pharmacokinetics at the recommended dosage range. 
Distribution:  Extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding; 
Vd: 80-90 L/m2, V dss: 113 L (mean steady state) 
Protein binding:  ~94% to 97% 
Metabolism:  Hepatic; oxidation via CYP3A4 to metabolites 
Half-life elimination: Terminal: ~11 hours Excretion: Feces (~75%, <8% as unchanged drug); Urine (<5%)  
  15.16 Potential Drug Interactions :   
Cytochrome P450 Effect: Substrate  (major) of CYP3A4; Inhibits  
CYP3A4 (weak).  Increased Effect/Toxicity: CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the levels/effects of docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided. If systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, a 50% reduction in docetaxel 
dose should be considered along with close monitoring for docetaxel 
toxicity. Refer to the package insert or LexiComp
1 for example inhibitors. 
When administered as sequential infu sions, observational studies indicate 
a potential for increased toxicity when platinum derivatives (carboplatin, cisplatin) are administered before taxane derivatives (docetaxel, paclitaxel). Taxane derivatives may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of 
anthracyclines. 
Decreased Effect: CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of paclitaxel. Refer to the package insert or LexiComp
1 for example inducers. 
Ethanol/Herb/Nutraceutical Interactions : Avoid ethanol (due to GI 
irritation). Avoid St John’s wort (may decrease docetaxel levels). 
 15.17 Known potential adverse events: Consult the package insert for the most current and complete information. Percentages reported for docetaxel 
Monotherapy; frequency may vary de pending on diagnosis, dose, liver 
function, prior treatment, and premedication. The incidence of adverse events was usually higher in patients with elevated liver function tests.

Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  15.188 Drug is a vesicant.  Monitor infusion site frequently for signs of irritation 
or infiltration.  Drug extravasation cau ses acute streaking, burning pain, 
and discoloration at the site.  Skin may be reddened for several weeks 
and occasionally blister and/or peel.  Reactions are usually reversible 
over time.   Because of this centr al venous access may be necessary.  
Discuss with MD if patient has poor peripheral venous access.  If 
docetaxel concentrate or diluted solu tion comes into contact [CONTACT_37381], 
wash with soapy water immediately.   If it comes into contact [CONTACT_445184], wash with warm water immediately. 
 15.189a Instruct patient to report any sign s of peripheral neuropathy to the health

Discuss with MD possible ways to manage itching and skin changes that 
may occur up to a week after docetaxel administration.  Advise patients that nails may crack, peel, or fall off all together. This may be a chronic toxicity.  Instruct patient to keep nails clean, short and to avoid wearing nail polish or artificial nails.

16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 Note:   The first patient enrolled will be excluded from all analyses because they received Docetaxel (15 
mg/m2) on days 1, 8 and Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 15 as well.  All other patients will only 
receive Day 1 and 8 of Docetaxel (15 mg/m2 each da y).  This first patient was still eligible per 
protocol.  Per Addendum 1, day [ADDRESS_566224] ratified into two patient cohorts: pa tients who do not have ECE (“cohort 
A”) and patients who have ECE (“cohor t B”).  Cohort B patients will be treated with a slightly higher 
MC1273 39  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  radiation dose (36 rather than 30 Gy), but will be fo llowed and evaluated in the same fashion as patients 
in Cohort A.  Each cohort will be independently evaluated for all the endpoints described below 
 
16.1   Overview:  This phase II study, with a feasability analysis in the first [ADDRESS_566225] therapy for this disease 
yields a 2-year cumulative incidence of local/regional failure of approximately 
10% (Ang KK, Harris J, Wheeler R, et al.), but it also has high rates of grade 3 or worse adverse events (Bernier J, Domenge C, Ozsahin M, et al).  Given the high 
rates of severe or worse functional mucosal adverse events (AEs), especially, it is of high interest to find a chemo/RT combination that can still yield low rates of 
local/regional failure with reduced AE rates.  If this new treatment combination 
can achieve a 2-year cumulative inciden ce of local/regional failure of no more 
than 20% (primary endpoint), while significantly reducing the acute grade 3+ functional mucosal AE rate as compared to historical controls (key secondary endpoint), further study would be warranted.  In addition to the 2-year cumulative incidence rate and the acute functional mucosal adverse event rate, 
this study will assess many additional sec ondary endpoints, including, overall 
survival, disease-free survival, distant failure rates, quality of life (QOL) 
measures, swallowing studies, other acute adverse events, and late adverse events 
and translational studies.     
 
16.2 Primary Endpoint: The 2-year cumulative in cidence of local/regional failure associated 
with adjuvant hyperfractionated radiation and docetaxel in patients with intermediate risk 
HPV+ Associated Oropharynx Cancer.  All pa tients meeting the eligibility criteria who 
have signed a consent form, and begun treatme nt will be considered evaluable for the 2-
year cumulative incidence rate.   
 
16.21  Analysis plans: Given that the cu rrent standard therapy yields a 2-year 
cumulative incidence of local/regional failure of around 10% (Ang KK, Harris J, 
Wheeler R, et al.), this study treatment will be of interest for further study if the   2-year cumulative incidence of local/reg ional failure does not exceed 20%, while 
also significantly reducing AE rates (see 16.3, key secondary endpoint).  The 2-
year cumulative incidence of local/regional failure will be estimated by [CONTACT_445185] (Gooley, et al.), where the competing risks are distant failures and deaths from other causes (i.e. deaths from distant failure or non
-
Oropharynx Cancer).  If the 2-year cumula tive incidence of local/regional failure 
does not exceed 20%, this will give eviden ce that a 2-year local/regional failure 
rate of around 10% can not be ruled out, since the 2-sided 85% confidence interval would contain 10% (85% CI: 10 – 30%) with 35 evaluable patients  using nQuery Advisor version 6.01 for confidence intervals for a single proportion.   
  
16.3  Key Secondary Endpoint:  To characterize the acute grade 3 or higher functional mucosal 
adverse events (up to [ADDRESS_566226]-XRT) associated with adjuvant hyperfractionated 
radiation and docetaxel in patients with in termediate risk HPV+ Associated Oropharynx 
Cancer.  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form, and 
begun treatment will be considered evalua ble for this key secondary endpoint.  
 
16.31 Definition of success:  A success will be defined as a patient who does   
MC1273 40  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  not experience a grade 3+ functional mucosal adverse event in the first 
month post- XRT.   
16.32 Power, Sample Size:  The current standard of care yields acute grade 3+ 
functional mucosal AE rates of approximately 40% (Bernier J, Domenge C, Ozsahin M, et al.).  This regimen will be of high interest based on safety if the acute grade 3+
 functional mucosal AE rate could be reduced 
to around 20% or lower.    
With [ADDRESS_566227] 85% power 
to detect an acute grade 3+ functional mucosal AE-free rate of 80%, with 
a 0.06 level of significance if the true grade 3+ AE-free rate is 60%.  The decision rule for this trial is as follows:  If 25 or fewer patients are grade 3+ AE-free after [ADDRESS_566228]-XRT, we will conclude that the AE rate is 
not significantly reduced in this patient population.  If 26 or more patients are grade 3+ AE-free, this will be considered adequate evidence 
of safety for this treatment and it may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies, especially if the primary endpoint discussed above meets criteria as well (see 16.21).  
 
16.4  Sample Size:   We will enroll 35 evaluabl e patients per cohort  to the combination of 
adjuvant hyperfractionated radiation and docetaxel (total patients = 70 evaluable patients.)  We anticipate accruing an add itional 5 patients per cohort to account for 
ineligibilities, cancellations, major violations , or other reasons.  Therefore, maximum 
accrual will be 80 patients. Following the a pproval of addendum 6, overall accrual will 
increase to 81 patients so that additional pa tient data can be used for analysis.  
 
16.5  Accrual Time and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate is approximately [ADDRESS_566229] 5 patients:  In th e first 5 patients, acute adverse events (up to [ADDRESS_566230]-XRT) will be closely monitored to make sure that nothing unusual occurs.  
Based on the current standard of care, we e xpect that no more than 50% of patients will 
have a grade 3+ non-hematologic AE (regardless of  attribution).  If [ADDRESS_566231] a grade 3+ non-hematologic AE, we will consider lowering the dose even further for further evaluation.  In addition, if [ADDRESS_566232] 5 patients will be included in the final analysis as well.     
 16.7 Definitions and Analyses of Secondary Endpoints: 
 
16.71   Overall Survival (OS) is defined as th e time from registration to death due to any 
cause. The distribution of OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier
 (Kaplan E, Meier P).   
 
MC1273 41  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  16.72  Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from registration to the first of 
either disease recurrence or death. The distribution of DFS will be estimated 
using the method of Kaplan-Meier (Kaplan E, Meier P).    
 
16.73 Distant Failure Rates:   The 2-year cumulative incidence of distant failure will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_445186] (Gooley, et al.), where the competing 
risks are local/regional failures and deaths from other causes (i.e. deaths from local/regional failure or non-Oropharynx Cancer).   
 
16.74    Quality of Life (QOL): The patient QOL will be measured using the following 
tools:   1) XeQOLS form, 2) Eq-5D, 3) FACT H & N (Version 4), 4)  
Dermatology Life Quality Index; and QLQ H&N35 (see QOL Booklet).  These 
QOL measures will be assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_566233] or the nonparametric equivalent to see if the QOL tends to improve over time with 
treatment.   
 
16.75 Patient Assessment Form (Appendix V) : The data from this form will be 
analyzed descriptively, using frequenci es and percentages for each timepoint 
(baseline, [ADDRESS_566234]-XRT). 
 
16.76 Swallowing Studies:  Swallowing will be scored (yes, no) for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
penetration, velopharyngeal incompeten ce, epi[INVESTIGATOR_445165], tongue base 
retraction, and pharyngeal swallow response using the metric outlined by 
[CONTACT_445177].  (Eisbruch A, Teresa L, Bradford CR, et al.)  Swallowing assessments will be completed at baseline, along with 1and [ADDRESS_566235] patterns and subs tantial changes over time. In addition, 
McNemar’s test for paired samples w ill be used to see if the swallowing 
questions significantly change over time for each post-baseline timepoint.   
 16.77  Acute Adverse Events (up to [ADDRESS_566236]-XRT):  All eligible patients that have 
initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing acute adverse events, defined as any adverse event that occurs in the [ADDRESS_566237]-XRT.  The 
maximum grade for each type of acute adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be revi ewed to determine patterns, especially 
focusing on grade 3+ adverse events, regardless of attribution to the study 
treatment. 
 
16.78 Late Adverse Events (up to [ADDRESS_566238]- XRT):    All eligible patients that have 
initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient for up to [ADDRESS_566239]-treatment, and frequency tables will be 
reviewed to determine patterns, especially  focusing on grade 3+ non-hematologic 
adverse events, regardless of attributio n to the study treatment.  Hematologic 
adverse events will not be followed closely long-term given that adjuvant 
treatment is only given for 1 month.   
 
MC1273 42  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  16.79 Translational studies: Due to the limited sample size in this study, the proposed 
translational studies are considered expl oratory and hypothesis generating.   
Tumor specimens (at baseline) will be assessed for E6/E7 mRNA of HPV16 and 
other high-risk serotypes on a chromogenic RNA ISH assay called RNAscope 
(see 17.4).  In addition, serum collected before and one week post-radiation will be assessed for changes in TGF-beta1 levels (see 14.3).  We will also assess the pre-surgery blood samples as well for patients that are pre-registered to the trial.  We plan to correlate these markers w ith clinical endpoints like acute adverse 
events, cumulative incidence rates of lo cal/regional failure, overall survival, and 
disease-free survival.  Statistical and graphi cal techniques will be used to explore 
the relationships between tumor markers and clinical data. For time-to-event 
endpoints, we will use Cox proportional hazards models, and for binary endpoints we will use Logistic regression models. In addition, we will use the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests to test the association between categorical 
marker data and binary endpoints. All th ese statistical techniques will allow us to 
explore whether these tumor markers are potentially related to the clinical 
endpoints of acute adverse events, cumula tive incidence rates of local/regional 
failure, overall survival, and disease-free survival.  
16.8     Data & Safety Monitoring: 
 
16.81   The principal investigator(s) and th e study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The trial is monitored continually by [CONTACT_445187] 4 and 5 event in real time.  The Mayo Clinic 
Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Mon itoring Board (DSMB) is responsible 
for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on 
reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  Any safety issues requiring protocol changes are communicated through protocol amendments.   
 
16.82    Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:   The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_445166].  We note that the Adverse Event 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31921] (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduc t of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation.  The st udy team may choose to suspend accrual 
because of unexpected adverse event profil es that have not crossed the specified 
rule below. 
 
Based on data from previous studies, we  expect about 50% of patients to 
experience Grade 3+ non-hematologic adverse events within [ADDRESS_566240]-
treatment.  Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
observe adverse events that satisfy  any of the following criteria: 
 
 If at any time [ADDRESS_566241] 20  treated patients 
experience a Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adverse event (regardless of attribution). 
 If at any time [ADDRESS_566242] 20 treated 
patients (regardless of attribution). 
 If after the first [ADDRESS_566243] been treated:  
MC1273 43  MCCC Addendum 5  
 
Protocol Version Date:  October 03, 2017  o 60% or more of all patients experience a Grade 3 or 4 non-
hematologic adverse event (regardless of attribution). 
o 10% or more of all patients experience a Grade 5 adverse event 
(regardless of attribution). 
 
We note that we will review all Grade 5 adverse events on a case-by-case basis 
as well (regardless of attribution), and may suspend accrual after just one Grade 5 event, if we feel it is necessary for patient safety. 
 
16.9 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
(i.e., “Outcome Measures”) along with other required information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov.  For purposes of timing of the Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 60 months after 
the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” 
(PECD) for this study is when the last patient  registered has been followed for at least [ADDRESS_566244] based on racial and gender groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power 
for subset analyses.

Either 2-6 FFPE tissues curls or samples from fresh  frozen tumor will be collected from original 
tumor biopsy, tumor removed during surgery, or r ecurrent tumor specimens. This tissue is already 
being collected and shared through  protocol 50-97.  This tissue will be 
used for determining tumor-specific genetic alterations. Detected alterations may be compared to 
upwards of 50 samples of normal tissue from IRB 13-000883. 
 
Additionally, we may examine tumor specimens from Tissue Registry through our collaborators 
either within Mayo Clinic or at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).  This may 
include whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, focused exome sequencing, mate-
pair analysis, HPV-subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], immunologic profiling, RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, cytogenetics, molecular testing, protein expression, or immunohistochemistry.  Towards this end, up to 30 slides (5 microns thick) will be retr ieved from tissue blocks from the primary tumor, 
nodal disease, and/or sites of metastatic/ recurrent  disease.  If slides need to be obtained from 
FNA or core biopsy specimens, particular care will be taken to minimize the slides taken so that 
the block is not exhausted.  Slides sent to MS KCC will be de-identifie d of patient data and 
labelled with the patient st udy number from MC1273.

Radiation Therapy Quality Control Guidelines 
 
 1. Tumor Volume Coverage 
a. No deviation -- coverage + < 1 cm of specified. 
b. Minor deviation -- coverage + > 1 to 2 cm of specified or failure to cover tumor volume + > 1/2 
specified margin. 
c. Major deviation -- > [ADDRESS_566251] and/or MRI scans available to assess treatment 
volume appropriateness (if not initially available shoul d be requested) or failure to cover the target 
(tumor or tumor + edema) as defined in the protocol. 
 2. Isodoses - initial volume isodose plots are required on a mi nimum of three contours; one at central axis (CA), 
one superior to CA (2 cm below the superior field edge) and one inferior to CA (2 cm above the inferior field edge).  Boost volume isodose plot required at CA.   a. No deviation -- isodoses submitted as required, and inhomogeneity across the target volume shall be 
no greater than + 5%. 
*b. Minor deviation -- isodose information incomple te or inhomogeneity across the target volume > 5 
but < 10%. 
*c. Major deviation -- no isodoses submitted or  inhomogeneity across the target volume > 10%. 
 * Deviations would occur only if is odose information is incomplete or not submitted after there has been a 
request to submit complete isodose information. 
 3. Normal Tissues  Normal structures are only to be included within the radi ation field in as much as this is necessary to treat the 
primary tumor volume.  A minor deviation will result when normal structures are unnecessarily included, but this is not felt to result in unacceptable toxicity that w ould interfere with the scientific aims of the protocol.  
A major deviation will result when normal structures ar e unnecessarily included in the radiation therapy field 
and such inclusion is felt li kely to result in a major increase in toxicity which would potentially compromise 
the scientific goals of the study. 
 4. Other parameters: (dose per fraction, total dose, overall treatment time and portal films). 
a. No deviation -- +/- < 5% of protocol specification. 
b. Minor deviation -- +/- > 5% to 10% of protocol specification. 
c. Major deviation -- +/- > 10% of protocol specificati on or incomplete data (i.e. no portal or sim films, 
etc.) available for review (after additional request has been made). 
 
5. Any individual minor deviation will result in an ove rall score of minor deviation; any major deviation will 
result in an overall score of a major deviation.  Multiple minor deviations will not add up to a major 
deviation.

Service Dog Training Program for Military Veterans With PTSD  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
10-10-[ADDRESS_178968]-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD)  and 30 service dogs 
(SDs)  in training. Veterans  will be recruited and screened for eligibil ity according to W arrior Canine Connec-
tion (WCC)  inclusion c riteria  Humans : 1) military veteran; 2) diagnosis of PTSD; 3 ) able to give informed con-
sent;  and  4) able to understand English. Human Exclusion Criteria: 1) fear of dogs; 2) allergy to pet dander; 3) 
active substance abuse; 4) active psychosis,  or 5) history of animal abuse. Dog  Inclusion Criteria: 1) non -ag-
gressive demeanor as evaluated by [CONTACT_154656]; 2) cleared by [CONTACT_154657]-ian; and 3) up -to date immunizations. Dog Exclusion Criteria: 1) medical holds.  
 
Recruitment/Screening: . Recruitment wi ll be via media attention, flyers, social media, and word of mouth.  
 
Procedures:  Veterans interested in the participating in the study will be prescreened by a research team mem-
ber(RTM ) for eligibility. Eligible veterans will be invited to participate. If veterans  agree to par ticipate  after 
their questions are answered.  They will be consented verbally, randomized, and  scheduled for their first ses-
sion  with the location dependent on the arm . After informed consent is signed, baseline data wi ll be obtained  
in an outdoor area at WCC  [service dog training program (SDTP ) arm] or at another meeting place  near the 
participant’s home  [wait  list control intervention( (WLCI ) arm]. 
 
Randomization:  Participants  will be block randomized, according to gender, into the SDTP or WLCI. Group 
assignment s will be generated by a computerized ran dom number table  and envelopes will be opened after  
verbal informed consent.  Participants will continue existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] b egin any for which they are re-
ferred while in the study.   
 
Interventions:  
 SDTP -Intervention (human) : Veterans randomized to the SDTP will be paired with an experienced WCC 
Mission Based Trauma R ecovery (MBTR) -Trainer (MBRT -T) and a SD. One hour training modules will be 
scheduled once a week for [ADDRESS_178969] Control Intervention (WLCI) : Veterans randomized to WLCI will participate in one hour online 
SD training modules (https://e -trainingfordogs.com ) scheduled once a week for [ADDRESS_178970] with 
service dogs. The online training modules are delivered by [CONTACT_154658]. Participants will participate from their ho mes or at a location of their choice in 
online training mod ules.   
 
Outcome Assessment: In both groups, human’s bio logical [e.g. salivary and hear t rate variability ( HRV) ] 
markers except telomere length  (TL) will be assessed in weeks 1, 4, and 8. TL will be assessed at weeks 1 and 
8.  Scales for and  psychosocial data will be  completed  prior to session 1 and after sessions 4 and 8. HRV will 
be recorded in the human participants during  SDTP sessions and  for 30 minutes after  session s.  
 
Assessment: Human Demographics and Characteristics Questionnaire will collect demographic/descrip-
tive data on the human participants, such as gender, age, race, ethnicity, marital status, educational level,  liv-
ing arrangements, military history and pet ownership hist ory. The order of the questionnaires will be random-
ized to minimize order effects. A dog d emographics and c haracteristics questionnaire will collect demo-
graphic/descriptive data including dog’s name, WCC dog trainer’s name, gender, age, breed, and weight. Ad-
ditionally, a photo will be taken to illustrate size and face . 
 
Aim 1 Outcome Assessment:  
Primary outcome:  PTSDSS will be assessed with the PTSD C hecklist for DSM -5 (PCL -5), a 2 0-item 
scale.70.71  
Secondary outcomes:   
a) Stress markers will be assessed with salivary cortisol , α- amylase,  and HRV, and the perceived stress 
scale. Heart  rate variability  (HRV ) of veterans will be measured with a Polar H7 heart rate sensor worn 
around the chest and matching Polar V800 GPS Sports Watch worn around a wrist to save data from the 
heart rate sensor a nd download it for analysis.  Perceived stress (PS)  will be assessed  with the Patient -Re-
ported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Perceived Stress Fixed Form v2.0 (PROMIS, 
PS).72,73  and 
b) Psychosocial health  related to PTSD  will be assessed with well validated scales, including PROMIS 
measures:  Positive  Affect -Short Form 15 (PA 15a) , 75 PROMIS Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities 
(SSRA) – Short Form 4a ( PROMIS -SSRA) ,80,81 PROMIS Short Form v1.0 - Satisfaction with Participation in 
Discretionary Social Activities-  Short For m 7a (PROMIS SPDSA) , 82,83 PROMIS Companionship –  Short Form 
4a (PROMIS -C), 84,85 PROMIS Depression Short- Form 8a,87  and the PROMIS Anxiety Short- Form 8a.88  Sui-
cide ideation  (SI) will be assessed with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation.89  Quality of life will be assessed 
with the Veterans RAND 12 -Item Healthy Survey, 76 Resilience will be assessed with the Connor -Davidson 
Resilie nce Scale (CD -RISC -10), 78 and Quality of an individual’s relationships will be assessed with the Rela-
tionship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ). 79 
 c) The exploratory outcome : cellular aging will be assessed by [CONTACT_154659]-
sis.90  
 
Aim 2 Outcome Assessment : Dog HRV , is a reliable measure of stress levels.59,91   will be measured with the 
PetPace Collar (http://petpace.com). This non -invasive, monitor wirelessly tracks the dog’s HRV  and a range 
of physical and behavioral p arameters . 
 
Aim 3 Outcome Assessment:  Participant  attendance and participation in each session will be recorded by [CONTACT_154660].  The SD trainers also keep extensive notes on the interactions between the veterans and the dogs.  
Documentation of unintended consequences such as aggressive behavior (on ei ther part), allergic reactions, 
fearful behavior (on either part).  These logs will be used to assess participation in the SDTP.  Exit phone inter-
view s will be used to obtain veterans’ perceptions of the SDTP and their outcomes.    
 Data  Analysis  Plan  
Human D ata: Before  analyses, data will be cleaned  and illustrated graphically . Summary statistics will be cal-
culated, assumptions examined, and transformations applied as needed.  Demographics and baseline charac-
teristics (e.g., PTSD SS, gender ) will be compared between the SDTP and WLCI groups, and the relevant varia-
bles considered as  covariates for multivariable longitudinal analyses . SPSS 25 will be used for all analyses. Sig-
nifica nce for rejecting the null is set at p <.05, Bonferonni sequential corrections will be used for multiple com-
parisons. The intent -to-treat approach  will guide hypothesis testing. Separate sets of analyses are conducted 
for each outcome.  
H1: Participants in t he SDTP (n = 30) will demonstrate significantly greater improvement in outcomes from 
week 1 to weeks 4 and  8 than the WLCI  (n = 30) i n: a) PTSD sympt om severity; b) stress markers ( decreased 
cortisol, α-amylase, perceived stress ; increased IgA, HRV);  c) psychosocial health ( increased positive affect, 
QOL , resilience, and relationships with friends and family, satisfaction with social activities and roles, compan-
ionship and decreased depression, anxiety, and suicide ideation);   and d) exploratory stress ma rker cellular ag-
ing [increased TL , from weeks 1 to 8 only) .  
Linear mixed models (LMMs) with random intercepts (participant as a random variable) will be used to as-
sess differences in changes in each outcome between the SDTP and WLCI participants , accounting for the cor-
relation with  the repeated measurements  of each p articipant , and using all available data. Fixed effects will in-
clude group (SDTP or WLCI), week  (1, 4 and 8) , and their interaction, as well as the relevant covariates. The 
hypothesized effect of the intervention will be tested with the  week  by [CONTACT_154661]. Interactions of covari-
ates (e.g. gender and age) with the group and time will be explored to provide information about their influence 
and for preliminary data to justify formal evaluation (with adequate power) in future studies.   The multi -modal 
assessment in this study will provide the opportunity to explore characteristics that predict benefits.  
Dog data:  For analyses of data from dogs , demographics and baseline characteristics (e.g., size, gender, 
age) , will  be computed. The distributional cha racteristics of HRV (e.g., normality, outliers and missing) will be 
explored. Appropriate  steps will be used as  needed to ensure that applicable assumptions are met . Descriptive 
statistics will be computed for HRV by [CONTACT_154662]  (pre, during, and post ).   
H2:  Dogs who participate in the SDTP will not experience increases in stress ( decreases in HRV ) from the 30 
minutes before,  to during, and after SDTP sessions.  LMMs  with random intercepts ( dog as a random variable) 
will be used to assess the significance of cha nges between the three  periods , accounting for the correlation 
within the repeated measurements. Fixed effects will include period [pre, during, post SDTP  session] and week 
(1, 4, 8) . The  hypothesized effect of the SDTP  will be tested by [CONTACT_154663]. 
Interactions of dog covariates (e.g. , dog gender and age) with period  will explored to evaluate  their potential 
influence and for exploring a  need for  evaluati on of their role s.  
H3:  Dogs who participate in the SDTP will not experience increases in stress ( decreases in HRV ) over [ADDRESS_178971] of the intervention will be tested by [CONTACT_154664] 2 . Interactions of dog covariates (e.g. gender, age) with week will be ex-
plored to provide informati on about their potential influence to inform development of future studies.  
Feasibility data : Descriptive statistics will be calculated for number of sessions attended, rates of completion, 
drop out adverse events, and follow up questions, etc.   Effect size estimates will be calculated for each veteran  
outcome and for dog HRV. They will  enhance sam ple size calculations for a future multi -program RTC .   
Missing Data. While complete data are ideal and we will make considerable effort to obtain them , some 
missingness is likely . Randomness of missingness will be tested. If there is excessive or differential attrition 
across groups or informative missingness , we will apply sensitivity analysis, such as pattern mixture models 
for longitudinal data.[ADDRESS_178972] -traumatic stress

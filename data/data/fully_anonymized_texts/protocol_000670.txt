Acute lysine administration to raise 2 -AAA  Version 1. 2 
Protocol #   02-14-2017  
4 
 Genetics: Variation in genes encoding enzymes in the lysine degradation pathway (indicated in 
boxes in Figure 2) may influence 2- AAA levels and downstream function. The strongest 
evidence thus far exists for DHTKD1 , variation in which has been associated with 2- Ketoadipic, 
2-Aminoadipic and 2 -Oxoadipic Aciduria8, 11, and Charcot -Marie -Tooth Disease12. DHTKD1  
expression correlates with ATP production in mitochondria in vitro , and siRNA knockdown of 
DHTKD1  leads to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and increased reactive oxygen species 
production, resulting in apoptosis and reduced cell growth13. Variation in mouse Dhtkd1  has 
been found to associate with expression of the gene (eQTL) and levels of protein (pQTL) in 
liver, as well as with serum 2 -AAA levels5. Liver Dhtkd1 expression correlated significantly with 
serum 2- AAA in these mice. Further, liver 2- AAA was n egatively associated with liver mass, 
fasting glucose and serum cholesterol while higher liver 2- AAA was associated with higher 
insulin sensitivity.  
 
2.0  Rationale and Specific Aims  
Diabetes is a major global health concern, associated with significantly  increased mortality and 
high incidence of co- morbidities. The lysine- derived metabolite α -aminoadipic acid (2- AAA) has 
been identified as a novel predictor of diabetes development in humans, identifying at -risk 
individuals before any detectable glucose abnormalities. There is exciting preliminary evidence 
supporting the role of [ADDRESS_1071773] feasibility of 2 -AAA manipulation in humans through acute lysine administration.  
 
Specific Aim : To determine whether acute lysine administration leads to increased 
plasma 2-AAA in humans. Catabolism of lysine leads to generation of 2- AAA. To address the 
hypothesis that acute lysine ingestion leads to increased circulating and excreted 2-AAA in 
humans in vivo , we will administer lysine (10g orally) to healthy volunteers (N=10), and measure 
the level of [ADDRESS_1071774] -ingestion.  
 Sub-Study Aim : To measure clearance and excretion of lysine and 2 -AAA using stable 
isotope tracer  
13C lysine (5g orally) . Carbon- [ADDRESS_1071775] demonstrated an increase in 2- AAA following lysine 
administration in children with alpha- aminoadipic aciduria15, 16, a rare condition (< 1/1,000,000), 
Acute lysine administration to raise 2 -AAA  Version 1. 2 
Protocol #   02-14-[ADDRESS_1071776] examined the effects of lysine 
supplementation, albeit without concurrent measurement of 2 -AAA. Acute lysine administration 
in healthy subjects led to increased plasma lysine, lower plasma glucose, a small increase in insulin area, and higher glucagon. When lysine was administered in conjunction with glucose, relative to glucose alone there was a 44% reduction in the 2.[ADDRESS_1071777] meal including either baked or pi[INVESTIGATOR_705863]29. Treatment of 
overweight/obese adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes with pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (45 mg/day) and metformin (1000 mg twice/day) led to a significant reduction in plasma 2- AAA 
and lysine, concurrent with an increase in insulin sensitivity
30. Acute insulin infusion (7 hrs) in 
these subjects also led to a decrease in both lysine and 2 -AAA30, 31. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_779770], which acts through GABA transaminase inhibition, leads to increased 2- AAA in 
plasma and urine, to levels similar to those seen in alpha- aminoadipic aciduria.32

 • Inability to provide written informed consent 
• Inability to fast for 8  hours  
5.0 Enrollment 
 
We will enroll 10 patients (N=5 male, N=5 female) who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
In the sub -study, we will enroll 2 patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 The following recruitment approaches will be used:  Vanderbilt CTSA (VICTR) Research 
Notification Distribution List, the linked email system which reaches Vanderbilt faculty and staff, as well as members of the Middle Tennessee community,  and ResearchMatch, a national online 
registry maintained at Vanderbilt which allows people to self -register and express interest as 
research participants. In addition, we will contact [CONTACT_779773]’s prior research protocols and who had expressed interest in participating in future research studies.  Individuals who participate in the first study (using 10g lysine) who expressed 
interest in participating in future studies may be approached about participating in the sub -study 
for comparison purposes. Subjects may also be identified by [CONTACT_779774], by [CONTACT_23164].  
 
 
6.0 Study Procedures 
 
Screening  
Subjects will be screened via email and/or telephone. Informed consent will be obtained via 
telephone with a phone consent witness. After consent has been obtained, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to confirm that the subject meets study eligibility requirements. Subjects 
who meet the inclusion criteria, and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be invited to 
participate in the study.  Subjects who use protein or amino acid supplements but are willing to 
discontinue use for at least [ADDRESS_1071778] their dietary intake of all foods and beverages on the day prior to the study visit  (see Diet Record Instructions, Appendix A) .  
 
 
Study Visit  
Subjects will be requested to arrive at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center  on the morning of 
the study visit (~8:00 AM) in a fasting state  (at least 8 hours,  with no food or  drink, excluding 
water ). After informed consent has been reviewed and documented, inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be reviewed to confirm that the subject meets study eligibility requirements. Subject’s 
medical history and medications will be discussed and documented by [CONTACT_779775]. Study

Protocol #   02-14-[ADDRESS_1071779]’s vital signs, height and weight  prior to study interventions . All 
subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample for baseline [ADDRESS_1071780] (if the woman is of child- bearing potential) .  
 
Following the baseline urine sample, an intravenous line will be inserted into a superficial peripheral vein to perform blood draws.  Subjects will be asked to remain in a seated position for 
the duration of the study, but will be permitted to walk for brief periods throughout the study (e.g. 
to use the restroom).  A baseline blood draw will be taken ( time = 0 hr ) for measurement of 
baseline plasma 2 -AAA levels and related amino acids and metabolites (e.g. lysine, kynurenic 
acid).Immediately following the  baseline blood draw, subjects will be given an oral bolus of L -
lysine (10g) (Ajinomot o [LOCATION_003] Inc, Raleigh, NC) in 100ml water . This is an amount of lysine 
equivalent to that which is found in a 10oz serving of beef. A similar dose of lysine has 
previously been shown to alter the response to glucose
17. Blood samples will be taken at  time = 
[ADDRESS_1071781] -lysine  administration. Normal (0.9%) Saline (NS) will be 
infused at a rate of 10 ml/hr to flush the canula prior to each blood draw, and a 5ml blood 
discard will be performed prior to each collection of samples .  Each blood draw (including 
baseline) will collect  about 20cc of blood, for a total collection of 120cc , or approximately 8 
tablespoons of blood. Blood will be collected into one tube for serum (5ml) and 2 tubes for 
plasma (4ml each). Urine samples will be collected throughout the visit , in 2-hour increments (0-
[ADDRESS_1071782] -lysine). Although the timing of plasma 2- AAA increases post -lysine have 
never been measured, peak post -prandial plasma 2- AAA levels are expected to be observed 
~3hours post -lysine29. Plasma will be prepared from blood samples, and both plasma and urine 
aliquots will be frozen at -80°C and stored prior to analysis. Plasma and urine samples will be 
prepared for metabolite measurement by [CONTACT_779776]. 
Ferguson’s laboratory using standard protocols33. 2-AAA and other metabolites and biomarkers 
(e.g. lysine, creatinine) will be measured at Vanderbilt core facilities (e.g. Mass Spectrometry 
core) .

6.1 Sub- Study Procedures – Lysine Tracer  
Screening  
Of subjects who successfully completed the primary study, w e will invite two individuals to return 
for a second visit. If we are unable to recruit  from our original enrollees, we will recruit from 
within the original pool of interested volunteers or from participants who expressed interest in 
our future studies , using the same screening procedures described above.  Subjects will be

Study Visit  
Subjects will be requested to arrive at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center on the morning of 
the sub -study visit (~8:00 AM) in a fasting state  (at least 8 hours, with no food or drink, 
excluding water ). After informed consent has been reviewed and documented, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to confirm that the subject meets study eligibility 
requirements. Subject’s medical history and medications will be discussed and documented by 
[CONTACT_779777] . Study personnel will collect the subject’s vital signs, height and weight prior to 
study  interventions.  All subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample for baseline 2- AAA 
measurement  and will undergo a urine pregnancy test (if the woman is of child- bearing 
potential) .  
 Following the baseline urine sample, an intravenous line will be inserted into a superficial peripheral vein to perform blood draws.  Subjects will be asked to remain in a seated position for 
the duration of the study, but will be permitted to walk for brief periods throughout the study (e.g. 
to use the restroom). A baseline blood draw will be taken ( time = 0 hr ) for measurement of 
baseline plasma 2 -AAA levels and related amino acids and metabolites (e.g. lysine, kynurenic 
acid).Immediately following the baseline blood draw, subjects will be given an oral bolus of  
13C 
L-lysine (5 g) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury,  MA) in 50ml water . This is an 
amount of lysine equivalent to that which is found in a 5oz serving of beef. Blood samples will 
be taken at time = [ADDRESS_1071785] -lysine  administration . Normal (0.9%) 
Saline (NS) will be infused at a rate of approximately 10 ml/hr to flush the canula prior to each 
blood draw, and a 5ml blood discard will be performed prior to each collection of samples.  Each 
blood draw (including baseline) will collect about 20cc of blood, for a total collection of about 
160cc, or approximately [ADDRESS_1071786], blood will be collected 
into one tube for serum (5ml) and 2 tubes for plasma (4ml each). Urine samples will be collected throughout the visit,  in 2-hour increments (0- 2, 2-4, and 4-[ADDRESS_1071787] -lysine). Plasma will be

7.0 Risks of Investigational Agents  
Lysine Administration: Lysine is expected to be  well-tolerated  by [CONTACT_55473]. Lysine is used 
as a dietary supplement, available over the counter, with no known long -term risks. There are 
no additional risks associated with the use of stable isotope tracer 13C lysine. The proposed 
dose of lysine may cause mild gastrointestinal upset in some subjects. This is expected to be 
minor  and transient.  
 
Venous Blood draw:  This is a routine procedure that is considered standard of care in clinical 
medicine. At the study visit, subjects will undergo venous blood draws. All blood draws will be 
performed by [CONTACT_779778]. The risks to subjects are minimal, but may include pain, allergic reaction, infection or bleeding at the needle stick site. These usually resolve without  any specific medical therapy 
over the course of minutes to days.  
 
Private Health Information:  This information will be collected during the course of the study. 
However, only key study personnel will have access to this information, which will be stored i n a 
HIPAA compliant, password protected REDCap database. No protected health information will be shared with employers, insurers, or non -research personnel  
 
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to 
Participants or Others  
 
Adverse events will be reported to the IRB per Vanderbilt University IRB policy.

 9.0  Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and should notify study personnel if they wish 
to withdraw from the study. Subjects may request their biological samples to be destroyed at 
any time. However, any data or biological samples that have already been used for research cannot be destroyed. Subjects may be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator (possible reasons listed below). Subjects will receive financial compensation for 
completion of the visit.  
 
Possible reasons for withdrawal/discontinuation from study include, but are not limited to:  
• Noncompliance with treatment or procedures  
• Decision by [CONTACT_3445]/participant withdraws consent  
• Significant adverse event deemed by [CONTACT_450648]  
  
10.[ADDRESS_1071789] whether there is a 
measureable increase in 2- AAA in plasma or urine following lysine administration.  
 Based on preliminary analyses in a separate study (N=120 healthy individuals), we expect a mean baseline [ADDRESS_1071790] deviation of 0.0025 (arbitrary units  based on 
mass spec measurements). Accounting for this between- subject variability, in order to detect a 
significant change in 2- AAA post -lysine, we will require a mean post -lysine 2 -AAA concentration 
of 0.0055 (at 80% power, α=0.05). We expect the actual increase to be larger than this, and 
thus expect to be well -powered to detect a difference in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_38264]. Although  no data exist 
for the expected change in [ADDRESS_1071791] -prandial increase in 2- AAA (e.g. > 10 fold increase)
29. 
 The change in 2- AAA will be analyzed both as the overall area under the curve, and as the 
change from baseline to each subsequent timepoint (analyzed by [CONTACT_54959] T tests).

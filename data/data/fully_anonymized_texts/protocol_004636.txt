 Speci fic Aims  
 
Patients living with multiple myeloma ( MM) have  an increased risk of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE)  due to the disease itself and the use of targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs).   Prevention of VTE has 
become a major managem ent challenge  during MM treatment. There is a paucity 
of data with respect to the non -vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in the 
cancer population.  However, the NOACs offer comparable efficacy but improved 
safety compared with warfarin.  Api[INVESTIGATOR_9588]  (1,2).  The safety and 
efficac y of api[INVESTIGATOR_9589].   
 
Aim #1:   To quantify the 6 -month rate of major and clinically relevant non -major 
bleeding in MM patients receiving IMiDs who are prescr ibed api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg 
orally twice  daily for primary prevention of VTE.  
 
Hypothesis #1:   The 6 -month rate of major and clinically relevant non -major 
bleeding in MM patients receiving IMiDs who are prescribed api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg 
orally twice daily for primary  prevention of VTE will be ≤3% (2).  Although the MM 
population, in general, has a higher medical acuity than that of the previous large 
randomized controlled trials of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], we will be selectin g a stable population 
of MM patients who are appropriate for immunomodulatory therapy.  
 
Aim #2:   To quantify 6 -month rate of symptomatic VTE in MM patients receiving 
IMiDs who are prescribed api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg orally twice daily for primary 
prevention of VTE.  
 
Hypothesis #2:   The 6 -month rate of symptomatic VTE in MM patients receiving 
IMiDs who are prescribed api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg orally twice daily for primary  
prevention of VTE will be <7% (3).  Although additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_9590] -stimulating agents may further increase the 
risk of VTE, the rate of incident VTE should be reduced to <7% with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].

 Introduction and Background  
 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by [CONTACT_9653], 
monoclonal protein in the blood or urine, and associa ted organ dysfunction  (4). 
Overall survival has improved due to the advent of novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs).  As 
with other hematological malignancies, MM is assoc iated with an increased risk 
of venous thromboembolism (VTE).  The risk of VTE is further increased in the 
setting of IMiDs.  Currently used IMiDs include thalidomide (Thalomid), 
lenalinomide (Revlimid), and pomalidomide (Pomalyst).  A meta -analysis of more 
than 3000 MM patients showed that the risk of VTE incr eased nearly 3 -fold when 
the IMi D thalidomide was prescribed and nearly 8 -fold when thalidomide was 
combined with other chemotherapeutics  (5).  The r isk of VTE is amplified when 
IMiDs are combined with a novel proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, that was 
recently approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (6).  Due to the 
increasing use of IMiD -based regimens, prevention of VTE has become a major 
management challenge  during MM treatment  (Table 1 ) (7).  A systematic 
analysis of MM patients treated with IMiDs, especially in combination with other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], shows that VTE risk remains an important complication in this 
population (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818] G and Moslehi  J, unpublished data).

aAspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 -325mg daily), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fixed warfarin 
(1-1.25mg daily) and full -dose of warfarin (target INR 2 -3) have been used  for 
prophylaxis. Choice of thromboprophylaxis was largely based on physicians’ 
discretion.   
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.[ADDRESS_9049] a higher risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including 
myocardial infarction and str oke (7).  IMiDs also appear to increase the risk for 
arterial thromboembolic events.  In the long -term follow -up of 704 MM patients in 
two phase 3, randomized clinical trials, the frequency  of myocardial infarction and 
cerebrovacular events were 1.98% and 3.4%, respectively, in patients treated 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared with 0.57% and 1.7%, in 
patients treated with dexamethasone alone (https://www.gov.uk/drug -safety -
update/lenalidomide -risk-of-thrombosis -and-thromboembolism).  Lenalidomide 
carries a black box warning of significant myocardial infarction and stroke risks in 
MM patients receiving lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment.  
 
Currently, there are no guidelines regarding the optimal thromboprophylactic 
regimen for MM patients receiving  IMiDs.  A broad -based VTE prevention 
guideline for cancer patients is too general to be o f practical use in MM patients 
(8).  In the case of MM, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 -325 m g daily), low -molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH), and warfarin (target INR 2 -3) have all been prescribed for VTE 
prophylaxis.  However, the specific prophylactic regimen is ultimately based on 
the treating clinician’s best clinical judgment  (7,9).  The choice of VTE 
prophylaxis is further complicated due to frequent renal dysfunction  in MM 
patients.  Furthermore, these  patients are often  reluctant to undertake a n 
extended duration prophylactic LMWH regimen of daily self -injections  due to 
anxiety and injection -site discomfort .  An unintended consequence of LMWH 
injections is  that injectable prophylactic ant icoagula nt regimens are associated 
with decreased medication adherence (10).   
 
There is a paucity of data with respect to the non -vitamin K oral anticoagulants 
(NOACs) in the cancer population.  However, the NOACs have been shown to 
offer comparable efficacy but improved safety compared with warfarin.  Api[INVESTIGATOR_9591] (1,2).   
 
In a randomized, double -blind study (AMPLIFY), api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (administered as a 
loading dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 da ys, followed by 5 mg twice daily) was 
compared with subcutaneously -administered enoxaparin followed by [CONTACT_9654] 
5395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism  (1).  The primary efficacy 
outcome of recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE -related death occurred in 59 of 
2609 patients (2.3%) in the api[INVESTIGATOR_9592] 71 of 2635 (2.7%) in 
the warfarin group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60  to 1.18; 
p < 0.001 for non -inferiority).  Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who 
received api[INVESTIGATOR_9593] 1.8% of those who received warfarin (relative risk, 0.31; 
95% CI, 0.17 to 0.55; p<0.001 for superiority).  A composite outcome of major 
bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the

 patients in the api[INVESTIGATOR_9592] 9.7% of those in the conventional -
therapy group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.55; p<0.001).  
 
In the randomized, double -blind AMPL IFY-EXT study , two doses of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 
(2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) were compared with placebo in patients with VTE 
who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and for whom 
there was clinical equipoise regarding the continuation or cessatio n of 
anticoagulation therapy  (2).  A total of 2486 patients underwent randomization .  
Symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or death from venous 
thromboemb olism occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving 
placebo  versus  14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who we re receiving 2.5 mg of 
api[INVESTIGATOR_9594] 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 
(p<0.001 for both comparisons). The rate of major and clinically relevant non -
major bleeding in patients receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg orally twice daily for 
extended -duration prevention of recurrent VTE was similar to that of placebo.   
 
Though the stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation popul ation is different, the 
AVERROES Trial also demonstrated the strong safety profile of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], which 
had the same major bleeding rate as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  (11).   
 
 
Rationale for the Proposed Study  
 
MM is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) .  The 
use of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) , has 
improved outcomes for patients with MM but also increase s the risk of VTE .  
Prevention of VTE has become a major management dilemma during MM 
treatment. There is a paucity of data with respect to the non -vitamin K oral 
anticoagulants (NOACs) in the cancer population , including patient s with MM .  
However, the NOACs have been shown  to offer comparable efficacy but 
improved safety compared with warfarin.  Api[INVESTIGATOR_9595]  (1,2).  Compared with 
injectable thromboprophylactic regimens such as enoxaparin, api[INVESTIGATOR_9596].  The 
safety and e fficacy of api[INVESTIGATOR_9597].  The current study will evaluate api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice 
daily) in a patient population without a history of prior VTE.  Although the current 
study population is high  risk for VTE, it is likely to be lower risk for VTE than 
those of the prior randomized controlled trials of api[INVESTIGATOR_9598].  Furthermore, current practice is to provide MM patients receiving 
IMiDs with prophylactic doses (not treatment doses) of low -molecular weight 
heparin (such as enoxaparin 40 mg injected daily).  Accordingly, the rationale to 
test api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (2.5 mg twice daily) is consistent with the standard practice of 
prophylactic anticoagulation.

 The current study will provide ev ent rates that will inform the design of a larger 
randomized controlled trial.  If safe and effective, api[INVESTIGATOR_9599] a critical 
unmet need and will represent a substantial advance and “game changer” in the 
prevention of VTE in this high risk patien t population.

confirm menopause.  
 
*Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have 
artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in orde r to 
obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function 
of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout period below are 
suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their judgement in 
checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman c an be considered postmenopausal :

Treatme nt Description    
 
Patients will begin prophylactic anticoagulation within 3 weeks of passing the 
screening procedure.  Patients with MM receiving IMiDs will be assigned to 
receive  api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 2.5 mg orally twice daily for primary prevention of VTE for a 
duration of 6 month s.   
 
If patients come off IMiD therapy during the 6 -month study period due to 
progression of disease or therapy failure, api[INVESTIGATOR_9604].  
 
If during the study period the patient requires an invasive procedure or surgery 
that necessitates the  discontinuation of anticoagulation (study drug), api[INVESTIGATOR_9605]  (Appendix ,

Safety Outcomes  
 
Primary Safety Outcome  
 
The primary safety outcome is the 6 -month rate of major and clinically relevant 
non-major bleeding in M M patients receiving IMiDs who are prescribed api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] 
2.5 mg orally twice daily for primary prevention of VTE.  
 
Using the ISTH classification, b leeding is defined as major if it is overt and 
associated with a decrease in the hemoglobin l evel of 2 g/dL or more, requires  
the transfusion of 2 or more units of blood, occur s into a critical site, or 
contribute s to death  (12).   
 
Using the ISTH classification, c linically relevant nonmajor bleeding is defin ed as 
overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with 
medical intervention, surgical intervention, or interruption of the study drug.  
 
Secondary Safety Outcome  
 
All-cause mortality at [ADDRESS_9059] on computed tomographic (CT) venography, 
magnetic resonance (MR) venography, or contrast venography.   
 
PE is diagnosed on the basis of a mismatched perfusion defects on ventilation 
perfusion scan , the presence of a pulmonary a rtery filling defect on contrast -

(13): 
• The detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers, with at least one 
of the values being elevated [preferably cardiac  troponin (cTn) with at 
least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit] and with 
at least one of the following:   
(1) symptoms of myocardial ischemia;  
(2) new (or presumably new) significant ST -segment/T -wave 
changes or left bundle branch block;  
(3) development of pathological Q waves on ECG;  
(4) new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion 
abnormality by [CONTACT_9661];  
(5) identification of intracoronary thrombus by [CONTACT_9662] a new, focal neurologic deficit o f sudden onset, 
lasting at least 24 hours, not due to a readily identifiable nonvascular cause (i.e. 
brain tumor, trauma) , as confirmed by a neurologist  (2). All strokes during the 
study were assessed by [CONTACT_9663], and classified as primary 
hemorrhagic, non -hemorrhagic, infarction with hemorrhagic conversion, or 
unknown, as defined by [CONTACT_9664].  
• Primary hemorrhagic:  a stroke with  documentation on imaging (e.g. , 
CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging) of hemorrhage in the cerebral 
parenchyma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Evidence of hemorrhagic 
stroke obtained from lumbar puncture, neurosurgery, or autopsy can also 
confirm the diagno sis.  
• Non-hemorrhagic:  an ischemic focal neurological deficit  (and not due to 
hemorrhage) that appears and is still partially evident at 24 hours.  
• Infarction with hemorrhagic conversion:  no evidence of hemorrhage 
on an initial scan, but found on a subs equent scan  and is clinically 
relevant to the event , as determined by a neurologist . 
• Unknown type/no imaging performed:  the type of stroke could not be 
determined by [CONTACT_9665] (lumbar puncture, neurosurgery).  
 
 
Follow -up 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.[ADDRESS_9061].  
 
We will assess medication adherence via pi[INVESTIGATOR_692].  Medication adherence will 
be calculated as the total number of doses  taken divided by [CONTACT_9666] ([ x / 336] x 100 = medication adherence  [%]). 
 
Subjects will be given a study diary to fill out at home each day.  Subjects will 
write down the time they take their study drug and any side effects.  The study 
diary will be collected at a regularly scheduled office visit at conclusion of the 
study period.  
 
Subject Retention, Withdrawal, and Termination  
 
Continued participation of study subjects will be encouraged at the time of 
outpatient evaluation  through the 6-month  follow -up interval.  However, study 
subjects will be informed that they retain  the right to withdraw from the study at 
any time without compromise to their current or subsequent medical care.  
Subjects will be terminated from the study if they expi[INVESTIGATOR_9607].   
 
If study subjects elect to withdraw, they will be asked fo r permission to do the 
following:  
1. Be contact[CONTACT_9667]

Assessment and Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
Definitions  
 
Adverse events  
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational 
product.  The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and 
should be used to assess all AEs.  
 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent  
reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific 
occurrence of one or more adverse events).  
 
All SAEs that occur following the subject’s written consent to participate in the 
study through 30 days of discontinuation of dosing will be reported to BMS 
Worldwide Safety.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence at  
any dose that:  
  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the ti me of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9608]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incap acity 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.0 
  November 8 , 2017  
   
23 
 • is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], 
based on appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardiz e 
the subject or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such events include but are not limited to intensive treatment in an 
emergency department or at home for allergic bro nchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or non -
pathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  Although pregnancy, overdose, and 
cancer are not always serio us by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be 
handled as SAEs.  
 
 The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9609] 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless 
considered an “important medical event” or a life -threatening event)  
• Elective surgery planned before signing consent  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical 
procedure  
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for 
baseline/trending of he alth status (eg, routine colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission other than remedying ill health state 
that was planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is 
required in these cases  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no 
bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical 
intervention (e .g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
 
In this study, the following adver se events will to be reported to BMS, regardless 
of whether these reports are classified as serious or unexpected.  
 
• Potential or suspected cases of liver injury including but not limited 
to liver test abnormalities, jaundice, hepatitis or cholestasis.  
 
Pre-Existing Medical Conditions  
 
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  
Pre-existing medical conditions should be recorded in the baseline and 
demographic data section of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Pr e-
existing medical conditions should be reassessed during the trial and reported as 
an adverse event or severe adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.0 
  November 8 , 2017  
   
24 
 character of the conditions worsens significantly or unexpectedly during the 
study.  When repor ting such adverse events, the description should convey that 
the pre -existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (for 
example, “more frequent” headaches).  Previously scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9610] -existing medical condition should not be 
considered adverse events.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Collecting  and Reporting  
 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the stu dy, all SAEs, 
whether related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those 
thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be 
collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_9063] be collected that relate to any 
later protocol -specific procedure (such as follo w-up skin biopsy).  The 
investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that is 
believed to be related to study drug or  protocol -specified procedure.  An SAE 
report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its sta tus 
of seriousness.  If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study 
drug, but is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal 
of previous therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship 
should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
 
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to the study drug, and pregnancies must be  
reported to BMS within 24 hours:   
 
SAE Email Address:  [EMAIL_176]  
SAE Fax Number:  [PHONE_188]  
 
SAEs must be recorded on the FDA MedWatch Form 3500A. Pregnancies must 
be reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. 
(Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) 
initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 
hours to the BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting 
the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
SAE Reconciliation  
 
The investigat or will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases transmitted to 
BMS Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV&E). Frequency of reconciliation will be 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.0 
  November 8 , 2017

 done every three months and once prior to study database lock. BMS GPV&E 
will e -mail upon request from the investigat or, the GPV&E reconciliation report. 
Requests for reconciliation should be sent to [EMAIL_177] . 
The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for 
case identificati on purposes. If the investigator determines a case was not 
transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case will be sent immediately.  
 
Health Authority Reporting (US FDA IND)  
 
Investigators must adhere to local Health Authority Reporting Requirements. For 
studies conduc ted under an investigator sponsored US FDA IND, provide details 
of the following:  
 
• Any event that is both serious and unexpected must be reported to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as soon as possible and no later 
than 7 days (for a death or life -threatening event) or 15 days (for all 
other SAEs) after the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the 
information.  
• BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events 
filed with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form  
3500A, which can be accessed at: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/.  
 
MedWatch SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at:

Non-Serious Adverse Events  
 
A non -serious adver se event is an AE not classified as serious.  
 
Non-Serious Event Collecting and Reporting  
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.0 
  November 8 , 2017  
   
26 
 The collection of non -serious adverse event (NSAE) information should begin at 
initiation of study drug. Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they become serious.  Follow -up is also 
required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study 
drug, or those that are present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
 
Nonserious Adverse Events ar e provided to BMS via annual safety reports (if 
applicable), and interim or final study reports.  
 
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be captured and reported as 
appropriate:  
 
• Any laboratory test result that is cli nically significant or meets the definition 
of an SAE  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have 
study drug discontinued or interrupted  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to receive 
specific corre ctive therapy.  
 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than the laboratory term 
will be used by [CONTACT_9673] (e .g., use the term anemia rather than 
low hemoglobin value).  Laboratory test abnormalities are provided to BMS  via 
annual safety reports (if applicable), and interim or final study reports.  
 
 
Pregnancy  
 
If, following initiation of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] , it is subsequently discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of api[INVESTIGATOR_9612], 
including during at least [ADDRESS_9065] immediately notify [EMAIL_179] 
of this event via the Pregnancy Surv eillance Form within [ADDRESS_9066] be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the  eCRF .  Procedures to expedite reporting serious 
adverse events are described later in this section.   
 
 
Specific Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.0 
  November 8 , 2017  
   
28 
  
Study investigators should follow the follo wing guidelines to ensure the quality 
and precision of adverse event reporting:  
1. Use recognized medical terms.  
2. Avoid the use of colloquialisms and non -standard abbreviations  
3. If known at the time of adverse event reporting, a diagnosis should be 
reported ins tead of individual symptoms and signs (for example, record 
only “pneumonia” rather than “productive cough” and “elevated white 
blood cell count”).  
4. If the reported symptoms and signs cannot be medically characterized as 
a single diagnosis or syndrome at the  time of adverse event reporting, the 
information that is available should be reported.  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information 
as described earlier.  
5. A cascade of clinical events (such as sequelae of an a dverse event) 
should be identified as the primary, causative event.  The cascade of 
events can be further described in the adverse event narrative.  For 
example, when recording a death, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome  should be reported as the serious adverse 
event.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be determined at the 
time of reporting, “unknown cause of death” should be recorded.  
6. Any adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9614] a serious adverse event.  If a subject 
is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an 
adverse event, the event responsible for the procedure (not the procedure 
itself) should be reported as the serious adverse event.  For example, if a 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9616] a result of a 
major bleeding event, record the major bleeding event that necessitated 
surgery as the serious adverse event.  
 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written 
consent to participate in the study through [ADDRESS_9067] be classified according to intensity or severity, 
expectedness, relatedness, outcome, and treatment or action taken.  
 
Intensity or Severity  
 
The following categories for intensity or severity of an adverse event should be 
used in reporting:  
 
Mild  Awareness of a symptom or sign t hat does not interfere with the 
patient’s usual activity or is transient and resolves without 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.0 
  November 8 , 2017  
   
29 
 treatment and without sequelae  
Moderate  Interferes with the patient’s usual daily activities, but he or she is 
still able to function  
Severe  Interrupts a patien t’s usual daily activities and generally requires 
medication, surgery, or other intervention for treatment  
 
Expectedness  
 
Each adverse event should be evaluated as to whether it was expected or 
unexpected as follows:  
 
Expected  The specificity and severity  of the event is consistent with 
applicable information on api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].  
Unexpected  The specificity or severity of the event is not consistent with 
applicable information on api[INVESTIGATOR_3822].                
Unanticipated 
Adverse 
Device  Effect 
(UADE)  Any serious adver se effect on health or safety or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] , if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or appli cation or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with api[INVESTIGATOR_9617], safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
 
Relatedness  
 
Each adverse event should be evaluated as to whether it was related to the study 
procedures or api[INVESTIGATOR_9618] : 
 
Definite  An adverse event is clearly related to api[INVESTIGATOR_9619] a reasonable causal relationship to the 
use of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] ; another etiology is significantly less likely  
Possible  An adverse event has a reasonable causal r elationship to the 
use of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] ; an alternative etiology is equally or less likely  
Unlikely  An adverse event has little or no causal  relationship to the use 
of api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] ; an alternative etiology is more likely  
Not related  An adverse event is not relat ed to the use of  api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] ; there is 
no temporal relationship or a much more likely alternative 
etiology exists  
 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship.

Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
 
The study investigators must use the following procedure for reporting serious 
adverse events:  
1. Report any serious adverse event that occurs to the Sponsor within 24 
hours of knowl edge of the event (Monday through Friday).  If the 
investigator does not have all information regarding the SAE, he/she will 
not wait to receive additional information before notifying the 
Sponsor  of the event and completing the eCRF.  The investigator sha ll 
provide an event update when additional information is received.  
NOTE:  The Sponsor will automatically be notified when an adverse event 
or serious adverse event has been entered into the database when the 
investigator fills in an eCRF.  
 
2. In the reporti ng of serious adverse events, the study investigator shall 
provide any potentially relevant information including:  
a. Subject demographics  
b. Pre-existing conditions  
c. The complete description of the adverse event.  
d. Date and time of adverse event onset  
e. Severity

3. When reporting a death, the primary event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome shall be reported as the serious adverse 
event.  Death will be reported as the outcomes of the serious adverse 
event.  If the cause of death is unknown at the time of reporting, report 
“unknown cause of death.”  
 
4. The investigator shall report unanticipated  adverse device effects 
(UADEs) to the sponsor and Institutional Review Board within [ADDRESS_9069] learns  of the event.   
 
Sponsor Unanticipated Adverse Drug  Effects (UADEs) Reporting Responsibilities  
 
Any serious adverse event determined to be caused by [CONTACT_9674][INVESTIGATOR_9621] U.S. Food and Drug Administration and 
IRBs.  Upon notice of an unanticipated  adverse drug effect (UADE), the sponsor 
shall immediately conduct an evaluation of the UADE and report the results of 
the evaluation to the FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and participating investigators 
within [ADDRESS_9070] data will be collected using a web -based centralized electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  Database monitoring and quality control will be performed 
by [CONTACT_9675] (BWH) .   
Monitoring Plan  
 
Monitoring procedures will consist of the following:  
 
Site Initiation  
 
At the initial site visit, the Study Coordinating Center  shall conduct a full site 
qualification and traini ng.  Study Coordinating Center shall review the terms of 
the protocol with the site investigator and confirm the investigators access to 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.[ADDRESS_9071] the 
safety of study subjects and to provide ongoing, critical, and unbiased 
evaluation of the progress of the study will be appointed as an independent study 
safety monitor for the duration of the study.  The saf ety monitor will operate in a 
manner similar to that of a Clinical Events Committee/Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board.  
 
The safety monitor will:  
• Provide independent safety evaluation of events and adjudicate all actual and 
potential serious adverse events e xperienced by [CONTACT_9676];  
• Review aggregate safety data including the frequency of adverse safety 
outcomes, particularly death, symptomatic VTE and major bleeding; and c an 
recommend premature stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9622] P rincipal 
Investigator at any time.  
 
Interim Safety and Efficacy Analysis  
 
The safety monitor will review the safety and efficacy outcomes for the first 10 
patients enrolled in the study.   The need for dose adjustment will be made based 
in this interim anal ysis.  The safety monitor will review the safety and efficacy 
outcomes again at the completion of the study.

b. When 3 of the subjects receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_9625] (including fatal hemorrhagic events) and 
did not have a protocol violation such that he/she c annot be 
considered as representative of the intended patient population.  
 
 
Protocol Violations  
 
The Study Coordinating Center  will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_9626]. If a protocol violation is detected or suspected, the study site 
investi gator(s) will first be asked to provide a written explanation.  After 
reviewing the available information, the Study Coordinating Center will 
categorize protocol violations as either major (eligibility or primary/secondary 
endpoint determination compromise d or indefinite) or minor (data still able to be 
used for endpoint determination), and will record and track them.  
 
The Study Coordinating Center will communicate with the study enrollment  site 
personnel to confirm that a process is in place to ensure that  further protocol 
violations do not recur.  
 
Data C onfidentiality  
 
Hardcopy and electronic subject data will be maintained in a locked office at each 
investigational site and will only be available to the study site personnel and 
sponsor personnel during mo nitoring visits.  Patient identifiers including names 
and other personal information will be kept separate from the study data.  
 
Compliance with Laws and Regulations  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, Title 21 Code of 
Federal Re gulations, Parts 10, 50, 54,56 and 812, International Harmonized 
Standards - E6 Good Clinical Practices Guidance, and local ethical and legal 
requirements.

 Statistical Methods  
 
Sample Size Calculation  
 
The sample size estimate is completed using the 95% confidence interval (CI) 
method. We propose a sample size of 50 patients. It generates a half -width of CI 
less than 10% if the blood clot rate is <15%. Since our study expects an 80% risk 
reduction in VTE, our estimated VTE rate is about 5%. If based o n the 5% VTE 
incidence rate, the half -width CI will be <6%.  Therefore, the precision will be 
improved with narrower CI, since we expect an incidence much lower than 15%.   
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
For this proof -of-concept study, we will calculate:  
1) the 6 -month rate of major and clinically relevant non -major bleeding  
2) the [ADDRESS_9073]  will be examined using the 
chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for binary and categorical variables and  t-test or 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum for continuous variables  (if the subgroups are of sufficient 
size for statistical comparison).  Potential subgroup analysis will include patients 
newly diagnosed vs. recurrent/relapsed disease and concomitant medications 
(dexam ethasone, etc.).  
 
All tests will be two tailed and a  p-value of <0.[ADDRESS_9074] be on file with the Study Sponsor:

Feasibility  
 
Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9628]’ s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH) is a 777 -bed acute tertiary care facility 
providing medical and surgical care for patients with general medical, 
cardiothoracic, orthopedic, oncologic, neurologic, obstetric, gynecologic, and 
gastrointestinal conditions.  BWH’s affiliation  with the Dana Farber Cancer 
Institute (DFCI) has resulted in a large population of oncology patients receiving 
care in the inpatient wards and in the Cardiovascular Medicine clinics.  DFCI 
provides care to a large population of MM patients who travel from  around the 
world.  With the opening of the Heart and Vascular Center in 2014, BWH has 
solidified its position as a world leader in cardiovascular care and research, 
supporting an integrated care model in a single location.  BWH is one of the 
world -leaders  in the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_9629] -oncology.  [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_3818]’s 
cardiovascular medicine outpatient practice, which is based in the Heart and 
Vascular Center, includes a large number of referrals for thrombosis in the 
setting of malignancy.   
 
The BWH Throm bosis Research Group  
 
The Thrombosis Research Group, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_9587] Z. Goldhaber, MD, 
Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Section Head of Vascular 
Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], is based at BWH and Harvard 
Medical School.  The Thrombosis Research Group has a decades -long

 commitment to improving the care for patients with cancer and increased 
thrombosis risk.  
 
The Thrombosis Research Group has an infrastructure of experienced 
leadership, with trained personnel in a multidisciplin ary academic team 
(pharmacists, fellows, research nurses, research coordinators, biostatisticians, 
administrators, and medical informatics specialists).  Data storage and computing 
resources, as well as a network of regional, national, and international 
collaborating investigators, facilitate our execution of ongoing research projects 
and our planning of future research projects.  The Thrombosis Research Group 
has studied all aspects of thrombosis in malignancy, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], 
diagnosis, and VTE pr evention.  According to www.pubmed.gov, the Group has 
authored more than [ADDRESS_9076]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9630] d 
(14) and high -impact reviews that he has published on the subject  (7,15).  Drs. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9631].  Examples of 
major Thrombosis Research Group -led trials in thrombosis prevention in clude the 
2500 -patient multicenter Electronic Alert Trial  (16), the 2500 -patient multicenter 
Physician Alert Trial  (17), and the 2500 -patient Discharge Alert Trial  (18).   
 
For this trial, the Clinical Coordinating Center of the Thrombosis Resea rch Group 
will draft and finalize the study protocol, informed consent, and case report form, 
obtain Institutional Review Board approval, create an electronic data repository, 
assist the clinical centers with local IRB approval, file the IND, ensure scient ific 
and financial integrity, approve site payments, plan and host an Investigators 
Meeting, perform the data analysis, and draft and submit for publication the study 
manuscript.  
 
Vanderbilt Cardio -Oncology Program  
 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center wil l be the Study Enrollment Center.  The 
proposed study will be feasible because Vanderbilt is a large Center of 
Excellence for MM care with active clinical research programs. Specifically, the 
Vanderbilt Cardio -Oncology program, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Javid Mosleh i, brings 
together physicians and scientists with a focus on cardiac, vascular and 
thrombotic complications that occur as a result of cancer and cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
The integrative and collaborate nature of the Vanderbilt Cardio -Oncology 
program is illustrat ed by [CONTACT_9681]. The laboratory of [CONTACT_9689] is 
investigating the mechanisms of vascular and thrombotic toxicity associated with 
IMiDs and PIs. At the same time, the group is already embarking on several 
clinical and translation studies foc used on cardiovascular effects of MM 
treatments. [CONTACT_9690], Director of Cardio -Oncology at Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center will work closely with colleagues in oncology, including 
[CONTACT_9691]. F. Cornell in spearheading the recruitment effort.  
 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_9584] y Prevention of VTE in MM  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3818], et al. Version  17.[ADDRESS_9077]  
 
The foreseeable risk  of api[INVESTIGATOR_9632] i n patients with 
MM receiving IMiDs is major or clinically relevant non -major bleeding.  
 
Risks of Research Procedures Performed on Subjects  
 
The risk of research procedures include psychological discomfort from 
participating in  a clinical trial (less likely ) and loss of confidentiality of medical 
records or economic data (rare).   
 
Women of childbearing potential (able to get pregnant) must have a negative 
pregnancy test before being considered for the study.  It is not known how 
api[INVESTIGATOR_9633].  Women of childbearing potential must 
use an effective method of birth control while participating in this research, as 
directed by [CONTACT_9682].   
 
Anticipated Risks of D rug 
 
Anticipated risks of api[INVESTIGATOR_9634], less like ly, and rare.  
 
Likely  
1. Anxiety related to participating in a clinical trial  
2. Discomfort or bruising at sites for blood draws  
 
Less likely  
1. Major bleeding requiring transfusion of blood products  
2. Clinically -relev ant non -major bleeding  
3. Nausea and vomiting

 4. Non-severe adverse drug reaction to api[INVESTIGATOR_9635]  
1. Severe allergic reaction (such as anaphylaxis) to api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]  
2. Thromboembolism  
3. Fatal, life -threatening, or intracranial hemorrhage or stroke  
4. Severe internal bleeding (such as gastrointestinal or retroperitoneal) tha t 
requires surgical or interventional laboratory intervention  
5. Death  
6. Other rare or unforeseen adverse effects  
 
Protection of Subjects against the Risks of Research Procedures  
 
Before Study Enrollment  
 
A rigorous screening process will be utilized to ensure that subjects  with an  
increased risk of harm due to enrollment in the study are excluded from the 
study .  This will include performing a detailed history and physical examination 
(to ensure that enrolled subjects truly fulfill all el igibility criteria)  and carefully 
reviewing the results of laboratory testing (in particular, hematocrit, platelet count, 
INR, and serum creatinine).   
 
During Follow -Up 
 
Changes in health status during the 6-month  follow -up period will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_102]’s primary phys ician, oncologist,  and other routine providers.   As 
api[INVESTIGATOR_9636] -approved drug commonly used for thromboprophylaxis and 
does not require routine follow -up clinical or laboratory monitoring for toxicity , the 
study will not mandate any follow -up visits  or procedures other than those 
required for the patient’s routine myeloma care.  
 
Protection against Loss of Confidentiality  
 
Subject confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_9683] -protected 
computer files.  All study data will be de -identified for storage in the electronic 
data repository.  In addition, any identifying information will be removed from 
images or other data used in publication or presentation s.  All database 
information will be stored on computer systems that are located behind an 
electronic firewall, which will only permit access to certified study personnel.  
Access to study data files will be password -protected.   
 
Use of Information and Pu blication

 All information concerning and relating to the study is considered confidential 
information.  This information includes the clinical investigational plan, case 
report forms (CRFs), training materials, and scientific data.   
 
 
Ethical Considerati ons 
 
In this prospective, single -arm, single -center clinical study, we will be evaluating 
the impact of api[INVESTIGATOR_9637] .  The benefits of api[INVESTIGATOR_9638].  The risk of bleeding  
in MM patients receiving api[INVESTIGATOR_9639] .  Currently used 
thromboprophylactic regimens for primary prevention of VTE in MM patients 
receiving IMiDs largely consist of injectable  anticoagulant regimens, such as 
enoxaparin and dalteparin.  These regimens have not been well -evaluated  for 
primary prevention of VTE  in the MM population  and are associated with patient 
discomfort, inconvenience, and limited medication adherence.  Api[INVESTIGATOR_9640] n 2.[ADDRESS_9078] approval at all study sites.

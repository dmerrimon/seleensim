Protocol 
Number  GenePOC-GBS_clinical-01 
Protocol Title  Prospective Multi-Center Study for Clinical Validat ion of the Molecular-
Based GenePOC™ GBS test for the Detection of the cfb  gene from 
Streptococcus agalactiae strains in vaginal/rectal swab sample, after Lim 
Broth enrichment, from antepartum pregnant women.  
System 
Summary  The primary purpose of this clinical investigation is to verify the performance 
of the GenePOC GBS test on the GenePOC system. This  will be achieved 
by [CONTACT_766439], a conventional method for 
detection of Streptococcus agalactiae in vaginal/rectal swab samples. 
Study  
Locations  Up to four (4) geographically diverse Canadian (2) and US (2) Clinical 
Centers are targeted, with each site testing high v olumes of samples for 
GBS  combined with high prevalence rates  and ability to perform the 
reference method. 
Intended Use  The GenePOC GBS test performed on the GenePOC syste m is a qualitative in 
vitro diagnostic test designed to detect Group B St reptococcus (GBS) DNA from 
vaginal/rectal swabs from antepartum women followin g enrichment in Lim broth 
for 18-[ADDRESS_1051402] utilizes auto mated sample preparation 
and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to de tect a cfb  gene sequence 
specific to the Streptococcus agalactiae  genome.  The GenePOC GBS test is 
indicated for the identification of antepartum GBS colonization and does not 
provide susceptibility results. Culture isolates ar e needed for performing 
susceptibility testing as recommended for penicilli n-allergic women.  
Investigational 
Product 
(IUO)  The GenePOC GBS test will be performed according to  the Study Protocol 
using the GenePOC™ instrument. The GenePOC system, used in 
conjunction with appropriate reagents, is capable of automated cell lysis, 
dilution of nucleic acids from multiple sample type s as  well as automated 
amplification and detection of target nucleic acid sequences.

Planned 
Study  Period  Clinical investigation to begin in January [ADDRESS_1051403] and to be 
completed within  approximately 8 weeks. 
Planned  
Sample Size  The purpose of the clinical investigation is to enr oll sufficient samples 
from four (4) Clinical  Centers to obtain a total of 150 samples positive 
for GBS  based on the  Reference Method final result. With an estimated 
prevalence of approximately 25%, up to 600 samples will be tested 
across all Clinical Centers. The performance obtain ed and the 
confidence  interval will be monitored during the study in orde r to stop 
the enrollment when appropriate. A  minimum of 30 positive results per 
site is expected but sites with a higher prevalence  of GBS  could 
contribute with more positive results to reach the required number. 
Objectives  The primary objectives of this multi-center prospective investigational trial 
are: 
• To establish the performance characteristics of the  GenePOC GBS 
Assay for its use to detect Group B Streptococcus ( GBS) DNA from 
Lim broth cultures.  Sensitivity and specificity will be established in 
comparison to the Reference Method. 
• To estimate the Positive and Negative Predictive Va lues (PPV and 
NPV) of the GenePOC GBS Assay. 
• To estimate the rate of unresolved results for the GenePOC GBS 
Assay due to Sample Processing Control failure (Unr esolved sample 
results). 
• To estimate the rate of indeterminate results for t he GenePOC GBS 
Assay due to an Instrument failure (Indeterminate s ample results). 
• To determine the reproducibility between sites of t he GenePOC GBS 
System.

Study Design  Four (4) geographically diverse Clinical Centers wi ll be selected based on 
a number of  criteria, such as investigator and site personnel a vailability, 
number of samples of interest tested  for Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS  
prevalence, familiarity with the Study Reference Me thod,  experience with 
Streptococcus agalactiae culture isolation and clinical studies.  
Site(s) that will perform the Reference Method will  have laboratory facilities 
where Streptococcus agalactiae characterization  methods are performed 
for routine, investigation or research purposes.  
This clinical investigation will be composed of the  following segments: 
Proficiency testing, Clinical  Accuracy, Discrepant testing (optional) and 
Assay Reproducibility (selected sites). 
There are no risks to the patient inherent to the e xecution of this 
investigation since it will:  
1) Be performed on excess de-identified samples only; and  
2) Include parallel clinical routine testing by [CONTACT_766441]. 
Results obtained from testing using the GenePOC GBS  System will be 
compared to those obtained by [CONTACT_766442].  Investigators will 
ensure that, for a given sample, the participating technicians performing 
the Assay are  masked from the results of the Reference Method and  vice-
versa. 
Electronic and/or paper Case Report Form(s) will be  used to record 
pertinent sample and  laboratory information. No personal subject 
information will be collected by [CONTACT_766436].  
In cases of discrepant results between the Referenc e Method and the 
GenePOC GBS A ssay, GenePOC staff will perform further characteri zation 
testing to elucidate the discrepancies.

35-37 weeks of gestation for whom GBS diagnostic pr ocedures are indicated and 
ordered. After the sample is  collected and transferred into the transport media (Amies 
or Stuart), it is transported to the laboratory and  stored at the appropriate temperature 
for no more than 96 hours.  
When ready for testing, the swab is placed into a c ulture tube with Lim Broth for 18-24 
hours. After incubation, a 15 µL aliquot of the bro th is used for detection of the presence 
of GBS. The aliquot of the broth is mixed with Gene POC Sample Buffer Tube Reagent 
(SBT) and then vortex for [ADDRESS_1051410] includes reagents for the simu ltaneous detection of the target 
GBS DNA, a process control (PC) to monitor processi ng, amplification, and the absence 
of reaction inhibitors. The GBS primers and probe d etect a target region of 190 base 
pairs (bp) of the cfb  gene of Streptococcus agalactiae . The results are interpolated by 
[CONTACT_766444]. 
Results may be viewed, be printed, transferred and/ or stored by [CONTACT_28024]. 
 
 Clinical Benefits and Justification for the Use of  a New Technology 
The group B streptococcus ( Streptococcus agalactiae , GBS) is a cocci gram-positive 
bacterium that is one of the main causes of neonata l mortality in developed countries. 
Neonatal infections caused by [CONTACT_766445] 1,2 , early or late onset. The 
early-onset infections occur during the 7 days foll owing birth; they are the cause of 
approximately 80% of GBS infections in newborns wit h mortality rate of 5-20% 3. The late 
onset infections occur between the first week and t he seventh month of life. They are 
rarer and the mortality rate is lower. In the case of early-onset infections, GBS is 
transmitted during childbirth via the genital tract  of the mother while for late onset 
infections, contamination is not necessarily via th e mother 4. Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766414]. Survivors may also suffer permanent damage su ch as mental developmental delay 
or loss of vision. 
Currently, the clinical guidelines of the Centers f or Disease Control and Prevention 5 and 
the Canadian Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecolo gists 6 recommend the use of a 
GBS screening during pregnancy (antepartum) combine d with a treatment of antibiotics 
for prophylaxis during delivery (intrapartum) to al l women detected GBS positive. This 
approach has reduced the incidence of perinatal GBS  infections in North America 7. 
Unfortunately, the presence of a vaginal colonizati on in pregnancy does not necessarily 
indicate the presence of a settlement at the time o f delivery. Some women are treated 
when they are no longer carriers of GBS, while othe rs are not, consequently they will be 
carrying GBS at the time of delivery. 
  GenePOC GBS Clinical Trial Protocol 
  GenePOC-GBS_clinical-[ADDRESS_1051411] by [CONTACT_747302] c hain reaction (PCR) in the early 2000s 
has demonstrated the usefulness of a rapid detectio n of GBS 8. This method however, 
was not fully integrated (independent lysis method of PCR system), unlike the GenePOC 
system, limiting its use to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_87278]. 
The GenePOC GBS test is a step further in rapid det ection of GBS by [CONTACT_766446]-of-use.  
 
 
4. TRIAL OBJECTIVES 
 
 
 
The objectives of this multi-center prospective cli nical study are: 
 
• To establish the performance characteristics of the  GenePOC GBS System 
for its use in  determining the presence of GBS  in vaginal/rectal swab, after Lim 
Broth enrichment, samples from antepartum pregnant women . Sensitivity and 
specificity will be established in comparison to th e Reference Method.  
• To estimate the Positive and Negative Predictive V alues (PPV and NPV) of the 
GenePOC GBS System. 
• To estimate the rate of unresolved results for the GenePOC GBS System due 
to Sample  Processing Control failure (Unresolved sample resul ts).  
• To estimate the rate of indeterminate results for t he GenePOC GBS test due to 
an Instrument failure (Indeterminate sample results ).  
• To determine the reproducibility between sites of t he GenePOC GBS System.  
 
 
5. STUDY DESIGN 
 
 
 
 Clinical Investigation Requirements  
Up to four (4) GenePOC GBS clinical centers will pa rticipate in the clinical study. Clinical 
centers will be selected for the clinical study bas ed on a number of criteria, such as 
investigator and site personnel availability, numbe r of  samples of interest tested for GBS , 
GBS  prevalence, familiarity with the study Reference Me thod, and experience with GBS  
culture isolation and clinical investigations. 
Site(s) will have a laboratory where GBS characteri zation methods are performed for 
routine, investigation or research purposes.  The exact same  media type, reagents and 
procedure will be used for performing the  Reference Method throughout the clinical 
investigation by [CONTACT_255564].  
 
The Clinical investigation requirements relating to  each Clinical Centers are detailed in 
Appendix A. 
  GenePOC GBS Clinical Trial Protocol 
  GenePOC-GBS_clinical-[ADDRESS_1051412] of four (4)  distinct segments: Proficiency testing, 
Clinical Accuracy testing, Discrepant testing (optional) and Assay Reproducibility 
(selected sites).  
 
5.2.1. Proficiency Testing 
Each PCR operator who will participate in the GeneP OC GBS clinical study will be 
trained by a GenePOC Study Manager (or CRA) on hand ling and performing the 
GenePOC GBS testaccording to the Investigational Us e Only (IUO) Package insert, the 
Study Site Manual and the GenePOC System  User's Manual. 
A test panel containing negative samples and GBS  positive samples will be used  to 
assess each new participating technician proficienc y with the protocol test methods. This 
panel will be provided in a sufficient number and w ill contain negative  samples and GBS  
positive samples. A participating technician failin g to achieve the qualification criteria on 
initial testing of the GenePOC GBS System must  repeat the training panel (a maximum 
of two times), and will be qualified if he/she meet s the  acceptance criteria for the 
repeated runs. If the participating technician fail s to meet  the retest criteria, he/she 
cannot be qualified for participation in the GenePO C GBS  clinical study as a PCR 
operator for the GenePOC GBS System unless re-train ing occurs and the participating 
technician is able to pass the proficiency test. 
To be qualified for participation in the GenePOC GB S clinical study as a PCR operator, 
each  participating technician must achieve a correct ans wer for all positive samples and 
true negative (no target)  samples in the molecular method using the provided proficiency 
panel. 
For the Reference Method no proficiency testing wil l be done.  
If a new participating technician is included in th e study after the initial training and 
proficiency testing occurs, the training of this pe rson can be performed by a GenePOC 
representative or by a  proficient PCR operator on-site. The new participat ing technician 
must also pass the proficiency test to  participate in the study. 
 
5.2.2. Clinical Accuracy Testing 
This clinical study is designed in such a way that all sites may perform the Reference 
Method,  which requires that each Clinical Center has labora tory facilities where GBS 
characterization methods are performed for routine,  investigation or research purposes.  
Reference method is defined as Lim broth culture, s ubcultured onto blood agar plate 
(BAP) for detection of Streptococcus agalactiae strains. More specifically, the 
Streptococcus agalactiae bacteria, when present, will be isolated using an E nriched 
Culture method. The exact same  media type, reagents and procedure will be used 
for performing the  Reference Method throughout the clinical investigat ion by [CONTACT_766447].  
To be considered for enrollment in the study, a sam ple must satisfy all eligibility criteria  
  GenePOC GBS Clinical Trial Protocol 
  GenePOC-GBS_clinical-[ADDRESS_1051413] are  masked from the results of the Reference Method and  vice-versa. 
The purpose of the clinical investigation is to enr oll sufficient samples to obtain 
approximately 150  positives samples for GBS  based on the Reference  Method final 
result. With an estimated prevalence of approximate ly 25%, it is projected that up  to [ADDRESS_1051414] three (3) lots of the GenePOC GBS Assay ki ts will be used for this Clinical trial. 
Each  Clinical Center with test a minimum of two (2) lots . 
Once per day, a reference GBS  strain bearing the cfb  gene (e.g.  American Type Culture 
Collection, ATCC [ZIP_CODE]) will be used as a positive external control (EC)  while not 
inoculated sample buffer will be used as a negative  EC. If either or both of the ECs fail 
to give the expected result, all samples tested in that run will be repeated from the 
remaining SBT containing the sample stored at 2-8°C  along  with new positive and 
negative ECs. 
 
5.2.3. Discrepant Testing (optional)  
 
In cases of discrepant results between the Referenc e Method and the GenePOC GBS 
Assay,  further characterization testing may be requested b y GenePOC to be performed 
by [CONTACT_766448] a ttempt to resolve the discrepancy. 
See Section 6.3.3 and Appendix C for description of  the minimal discrepant testing. An 
electronic  or paper Discrepant Results Form will be used for r ecording  discrepant testing 
information. 
 
5.2.4. Assay Reproducibility Testing (for selected sites)  
 
Reproducibility study will be performed with a pane l of samples spi[INVESTIGATOR_766415] 4 different 
concentrations of GBS: Negative, High negative (1/5 0x LOD), Low positive (1.5x LOD), 
Moderate positive (3x LOD). Each panel will consist  of [ADDRESS_1051415] the same  reproducibility panel at three (3) 
designated  sites (2 external sites and GenePOC laboratories) f or the within-run (3 
replicates), between-run (2 runs per day) and betwe en-day (5 days, consecutive or not) 
variance with multiple operators and  instruments. A single lot of the GenePOC GBS test 
will be tested by [CONTACT_766449]. 
The reproducibility panel will contain randomized m oderate positive, low positive and 
negative samples. 
Once per day, a reference GBS  strain bearing the cfb  gene (e.g. ATCC [ZIP_CODE]) will be 
used as a positive external control (EC) while not inoculated sample buffer will be used 
as a negative EC. If either or both of  the ECs fail to give the expected result, all sampl es 
tested in that run will be repeated from the remain ing SBT containing the sample stored 
at 2-8°C along with new positive and negative ECs.

 Sample Size Justification  
The purpose of the clinical investigation is to enr oll sufficient samples from up to four (4) 
Clinical Centers  to obtain a minimum of 150 and a maximum of 160 sam ples positive for 
GBS  based on the Reference Method final result. With an  estimated prevalence of 
approximately  25%, up to [ADDRESS_1051417] ed but sites with a higher prevalence 
of GBS  could contribute more positive results to reach the  required number. A potential 
minimum of  200 samples and a potential maximum of 300 total sa mples will be obtained 
at each clinical center. 
 
The performance obtained and the statistical confid ence intervals will be monitored 
during the  study in order to stop the enrollment when deemed a ppropriate. 
 
 Data Collection  
The principal investigator (PI) will ensure that ea ch designee and the scope of the 
designee's  delegated authority are recorded on the Site Signat ure and Delegation of 
Authority Log. The designee's  signature, initials, start and end dates, list of s tudy related 
tasks, and document review and approval must be rec orded on the form. 
 
5.5.1. Case Report Forms 
All Clinical Centers will use electronic data captu re (EDC) through an electronic Case 
Report Forms (eCRF). 
An eCRF will be completed for each sample enrolled in the study in order to record 
relevant demographic, clinical and laboratory infor mation. These forms must be  
  GenePOC GBS Clinical Trial Protocol 
  GenePOC-GBS_clinical-[ADDRESS_1051418].  This code will be 
assigned by a designated individual at the Clinical  Center., who is not  directly involved 
in any other aspects of the study. This code will b e a series of: 
• 5 digit XX-00Y (X being the site number and Y the samples number attributed 
sequentially

letter of the Middle Name [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a dash (-) if the pers ons does not have a middle name; 
L being the first letter of Last name). As per loca l regulations, initials can also be a 
series of three letters determined by [CONTACT_766450]. 
This code will have no relation with protected heal th information, and will be used only 
to track  subject enrollment. A Study Subject Log associating  each patient with its patient 
identifier code will be maintained in a secure loca tion on-site by [CONTACT_766451]. Neither the in vestigator, nor any member of the 
study team will have access to this log.  
 
Each enrolled sample will be assigned a unique Stud y Number, which will be identified 
by [CONTACT_766452]. Study Number s will conform to seven 
(7)  characters in a "GXnnnnA" format: where "G" is a le tter identifying the assay (GBS), 
"X" is a  letter identifying the site, "nnnn" is an increment ing number identifying each 
sample within a  study segment, and "A" is a letter denoting the stu dy segment, ("A" for 
Accuracy or "D" for  Discrepant testing). For panel members provided by [CONTACT_766453], the same study number pattern will be used and the study segment w ill be 
identified as follows:  "P" for  Proficiency, “R” for Reproducibility and "W" for Wo rkflow 
Practice.

6. LABORATORY TESTING PROCEDURES 
 
 
 
 Sample Collection 
 
 Vaginal/Rectal swab should be performed in accordan ce with published guidelines for 
collection of clinical samples for culture of Group  B Streptococcus (CDC in [LOCATION_002] 
and SOGC in Canada). 
Samples should be transported to the laboratory acc ording to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s policies 
but viability of GBS is preserved in transport medi um for up to 4 days between 2 oC 
to 25 oC.  
 
 Sample Storage and Handling 
 
• Samples that meet the study criteria should be labe lled with a bar coded study 
number  provided by [CONTACT_766436];  
• All relevant information regarding the sample will be recorded on the eCRF;  
If the sample will be processed within [ADDRESS_1051419] 
methods across sites. The Reference  Method is described in detail in Section 6.3.2 
of this protocol. 
 
The vaginal/rectal swab sample will follow the normal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766419], of which an aliquot will be transferred to  the GenePOC sample buffer tube 
(SBT) to be processed with the GenePOC instrument a s described in the GenePOC 
GBS test Package insert. Lim Broth culture remainin g in the container will then be 
used to start the Reference Method. 
 
Lim broth culture  must be kept at 2-8°C after testing for a maximum of five (5) days.

Final version 1.4 dated 2017-Jan-05 
 
 
 
Confidential Proprietary Information  Page 28 of 45  
When it  is confirmed that no repeat on fresh Lim broth cult ure is necessary, it will be 
transferred to a single appropriately labelled tube  and frozen at -70±5°C or colder for 
further testing of all negative frozen samples and /or possible future discrepant testing.  
 
The SBTs will be placed at 2-8°C in the event repea t testing is required. If the sample 
does not  require repeat testing, the SBT will be frozen at - 70±5°C. 
 
6.3.1. GenePOC GBS Assay 
 
The GenePOC GBS Assay will be performed according t o the assay Package insert. 
 
 Non-Reportable Results 
 
 
Samples that initially produce a non-reportable res ult (Unresolved, indeterminate or 
External Control failure) will be repeated as descr ibed below. Samples that have a 
reportable  (Positive, Negative) result upon repeat testing wil l be included in the data 
analyses. Repeated  samples that do not give a reportable result will n ot be included in 
data analyses. They will be  reported separately as non-reportable samples. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Unresolved Samples (UNR) 
 
 
An Unresolved Sample is when the internal control f ail (no amplification) and the target 
reaction (GBS) also show no amplification.  
An Unresolved sample will be repeated from the refr igerated SBT. These samples  may 
be repeated alone, with other samples to be repeate d, or included in a new run with 
fresh  sample. In cases where the sample is Unresolved aga in, no additional repeat 
testing will be performed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Indeterminate Result (IND) 
 
 
For an Indeterminate (IND) result due to an instrum ent failure, testing of the sample(s) 
will be repeated from the refrigerated SBT and may be tested with other samples that 
require repeat  testing, or included in a new run with fresh sample s. For any IND result, 
the Study Manager should be contact[CONTACT_766456]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. External control failure 
 
 
ln case of a failure of either or both external con trol, the testing of all clinical samples 
and any repeated samples included in the run will b e repeated from the refrigerated 
SBTs along with new external control (see Section 6 .5 for details). In cases where 
external control fails  again, the Study Manager should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

6.3.2. Reference Method 
 
 
The Group B streptococcus bacteria, when present, w ill be isolated from vaginal/rectal 
swab samples from pregnant women using a Lim Broth culture and subcultured on Blood 
agar plate (Important note, only Lim Broth could be  used for the study). The swab will 
be inoculated into a Lim broth (Todd-Hewitt broth s upplemented with colistin (10 µg/ml) 
and nalidixic acid (15 µg/ml)). Incubate inoculated  selective broth for 18–24 hours at 
35°–37°C in ambient air or 5% CO 2. Subculture the incubated broth on a non-selective  
blood agar plate (e.g., tryptic soy agar (TSA) with  5% defibrinated sheep blood). After 
incubation for 18–24 hours at 35°–37°C in ambient a ir or 5% CO 2, inspect agar plates 
and identify organisms suggestive of GBS (e.g., lar ge, gray colonies with narrow zone 
of beta hemolysis). If GBS is not identified after incubation for 18–24 hours, then plates 
should be reincubated overnight and examine for sus pected GBS colonies.  
 
 GBS Identification  
 
 
Colonies morphologically resembling GBS from blood agar plate (large, gray, and 
translucent with a small zone of beta-hemolysis or no zone of hemolysis) will be 
confirmed as follows: 
• Catalase negative; 
• Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains; 
• And one of the following positive reactions: 
• Group B streptococcal groupi[INVESTIGATOR_19753]; 
• Camp test; 
• Rapid hippurate and: 
• PYR test negative if strain is hemolytic (Enterococ ci can be haemolytic, 
hippurate positive but PYR positive) or a second pr evious test if strain is 
nonhemolytic. 
 
Note: no chromogenic agars could be used as FDA has  not cleared any. 
 lnconclusive Result 
 
For an lnconclusive (lNC) result in the Reference M ethod due to a non-interpretable 
blood agar plate, sample will be  retested from the existing inoculated and incubated  Lim 
broth. The Lim broth kept at 2-8°C should be used t o inoculate a new blood agar plates 
as directed in Section 6.3.2. 
 
 Repeat of negative samples for the Reference Metho d 
In case of suspected irregularity in the testing of  the reference method, the entirety of 
the specimens that gave a negative result with the reference method could be re-tested 
at a single testing site according to section 6.3.2 . In this case, the tested material will be 
the frozen LIM broth culture stored at -70 ⁰C.

) 6.3.3. Discrepant Testing  
Frozen Lim Broth and frozen SBT coming from discrep ant result samples will be send 
to GenePOC for further testing. 
 
During the course of the trial, the GenePOC Study M anager will inform the sites which 
samples  require to be ship to GenePOC.  
 
 Storage & Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
 
• SBT samples must be kept at 2-8oC after testing for a maximum of five (5) days. 
When it is confirmed that no repeat is necessary, t hey will be frozen at -70±5 oC 
or colder for possible future discrepant  testing;  
• All Lim broths ( Streptococcus  agalactiae isolates) must be stored at -70±[ADDRESS_1051420] be ship ped on 
dry ice to GenePOC;  
• All microfluidic cartridges (containing amplified p roduct) must be stored between 
2oC to  8oC in a plastic bag and shipped on icepacks to GeneP OC as directed by 
[CONTACT_766457].  
• Detailed shippi[INVESTIGATOR_766420].  
• At the end of the trial, clinical center will be in structed by [CONTACT_766458], as per their institution policy, samples t hat did not require shipment to 
GenePOC.  
 
 Quality Control Testing 
 
In addition to the quality assurance and quality co ntrol programs of each laboratory 
under their  respective certification (e.g. CLIA) , the minimum quality control 
described below must be  performed during the course of this study. 
 
6.5.1. GENEPOC GBS Assay 
 
 External Controls  
 
 
For each day in which samples are processed, approp riate positive and negative 
external  control (ECs) will be tested. These external contro ls results will need to be 
kept in the Site File and forwarded to GenePOC. 
 
External control materials are provided by [CONTACT_766436].  A reference GBS  strain bearing 
the cfb  gene (e.g. ATCC [ZIP_CODE]) will be used as a positive external control (EC) while 
not inoculated Lim broth will be used as a negative  EC. 
 
 Sample Processing Control  
The Processing Control (PC) is incorporated into ea ch microfluidic cartridges  and is 
intended to monitor for the effectiveness of liquid  displacement, sample treatment (Lysis) 
and heating during the sample processing steps. The  PC also monitors the  integrity of 
  GenePOC GBS Clinical Trial Protocol 
  GenePOC-GBS_clinical-[ADDRESS_1051421] the site on the measures to take prior to testing additional samples. 
 
 
6.5.2 Reference Method 
As determined by [CONTACT_766459], appropri ate positive and negative external 
control (ECs) will be tested on regular basis for t he reference method. These external 
controls results will need to be kept in the Site F ile and forwarded to GenePOC. 
 
External control materials are provided by [CONTACT_766436].  A reference GBS  strain bearing 
the cfb  gene (e.g. ATCC [ZIP_CODE]) will be used as a positive external control (EC) while

 Adverse Events 
 
• An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward me dical occurrence, 
unintended  disease or injury or any untoward clinical signs (i ncluding an abnormal 
laboratory finding)  in subjects, users or other persons (investigationa l devices 
only) which is associated with  the use of an investigational product or participat ion 
in an investigation, whether or not  related to the investigational medical device. 
This includes event not seen at baseline and event that if present at baseline have 
worsened in intensity.  
• Anticipated adverse events are defined as adverse e vents that are already known 
to  occur from past experience. However, as cited in Se ction 8.1 above, there are 
no  anticipated adverse events associated with this Stu dy Protocol.  
• An Adverse Device Effect is defined as an adverse e vent related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.  
• A Serious Adverse Device Effect is defined as any s erious adverse effect on health 
or  safety or any life-threatening problem or death cau sed by, or associated with, a 
device. 
• An Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect is a  Serious Adverse Device 
Effect for  which the effect, problem, or death was not previou sly identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the inv estigational plan, or any other 
unanticipated serious  problem associated with a device that relates to th e rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.  
• If an Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect o ccurs, it must be reported  
immediately by [CONTACT_9525] [INVESTIGATOR_766428] C and to the IEC (when 
required). GenePOC may additionally be required to report the occurrence to  
regulatory authorities. 
• Medical Device Reporting (MDR) - Any commercially m arketed device used in the 
trial which causes or contributes to a death or ser ious injury must be additionally 
reported to  the commercial manufacturer as an MDR reportable ev ent, under US 
federal regulations and Health Canada.  An occurrence of serious injury during the 
trial that resulted from the use of a marketed  device may require reporting as both 
an Adverse Event (to the IEC and Sponsor of the  trial) and as an MDR (to the 
commercial manufacturer of the device).

Adhesive Compared to Conventional Dressing: A 
Randomized Controlled Trial 
Background/Scientific Rationale:
Nearly all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182485] (IV) access for treatment. 
Patients rely on functional vascular access to receive life saving IV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Generally, peripheral IVs have high failure rates with 19-25% of IVs failing prior to 
completion of therapy and 45-56% of ultrasound-guided peripheral IVs failing prior 
to completion of therapy. Dislodgment, infiltration/extravasation, and phlebitis are 
common complications that lead to early failure. 1-5 IV restarts are a common 
procedure and are unfortunately simply a part of a normal workday for nurses.  A 
failure rate of up to 56% in a technology that is over [ADDRESS_215562], patients may experience treatment delays, dissatisfaction from 
repeat needle-sticks, and health complications if the patient’s condition becomes 
critical.  IV failure can result in a number of negative health/quality outcomes 
including phlebitis and infections and/or skin necrosis from caustic medication 
infiltration; utilization of invasive procedures such as peripherally inserted central 
catheters (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) and central lines; and wasted medical/nursing time.6
Because failure rate is high, it is important to approach insertions methodically to 
improve survival rates. One area of opportunity is securement of the catheter. 
Accidental dislodgment is a common cause of early IV failure accounting for up to 
50% of catheter failures.7 Beyond dislodgment, inadequate fixation of the catheter 
to the patient’s skin causes micromotion, leading to vein irritation and entry of skin 
bacteria into the entry site. This micromotion leads to phlebitis, occlusion, and 
infection.[ADDRESS_215563] practice for securement involves placement of a polyurethane 
dressing with clear tape. A variety of additional devices are available on the market 
including tissue adhesives, specially designed securement dressings, and sutureless 
securement devices. The evidence suggests the use of tissue adhesives may decrease 
peripheral IV failure with a decrease in dislodgments and occlusions compared to 
the alternatives.8 Bugden et al. found that skin glue reduced catheter dislodgment by 
7% and reduced peripheral IV failure by 10%.9
While some evidence supports the use of tissue adhesives for securement, further 
randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of this 
intervention. Further, only one prospective, randomized trial evaluated patients in 
the emergency room setting. Nearly 50% of all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182486] (ED) and 80% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182487].  This highlights the importance of understanding the impact of tissue 
adhesives on peripheral IV survival for patients admitted through the ED. While 
Bugden found that skin glue reduced IV failures for patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182488]: 2019-188

Specific Aim 1: Test the prediction that the experimental securement solution of 
standard dressing plus Adhezion Biomedical SecurePortIVTM will have a lower 
probability of failure compared to the control standard of care securement.
For Aim 1, an improved survival of the experimental securement solution will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_182496]. The event is failure of functionality identified during follow-up 
assessment during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Duration of dwell and functional failure of the 
catheter will be employed to estimate catheter survival.  
Specific Aim 2: Determine the difference in cause-specific IV failure rates between 
the experimental and control groups. Specific etiologies to be evaluated include 
dislodgment, infection, phlebitis, and occlusion.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the difference in costs associated with the experimental 
group versus the control group. Cost calculation will include all costs of placement 
in each group: labor and material. 
Study Design:
We propose a prospective, single-site, parallel, two-arm randomized investigation of 
catheter survival when securement strategies are evaluated. Specifically, 
conventional securement with polyurethane dressing and tape will be compared 
with experimental securement with tissue adhesive, polyurethane dressing and 
tape. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that there is better 
survival of the catheter securement with the tissue adhesive. Exploratory secondary 
and adjusted multivariable analyses will also be conducted.  
Pre-Enrollment Staff Training: 
The proper application of the tissue adhesive requires some education and training 
of staff. Research staff performing patient enrollments will be trained to place the 
tissue adhesive by [CONTACT_182497]/education team. A possible training may 
include a short didactic and hands-on session and application of the solution on

06.15.2020healthy volunteers/patients. Enrollment will begin once staff are deemed proficient 
in the procedure.
 
Study Population and Eligibility: 
Inclusion Criteria:
A convenience sample of patients with expected greater than 48 hours admission 
likelihood will be eligible for enrollment.
1. All adult patients greater or equal to 18 years of age
2. Admission from the ED to a progressive floor expected for over 48 hours OR 2a: 
Admission from ED to any floor type with express approval from the Principal 
Investigator
3. IV placement in the antecubital fossa, forearm, wrist or hand
4. IV placement in the Emergency Department 
5. Enrollment within 8 hours of IV insertion
6. 18 or 20 gauge 1.16 inch IV catheter
Exclusion Criteria:
1. Patients with ultrasound-guided IV insertions
2. Alternate site of cannulation 
3. Voluntary withdrawal
4. Patients with a non-standard polyurethane dressing
5. Known allergy to cyanoacrylate or formaldehyde
The survival analysis will only be performed on patients that have an IV dwell time 
greater than 48 hours. Over 85% of patients admitted to a progressive floor have 
length of stay greater than 48 hours. The sample size calculation reflects an 
assumed 10 - 15% exclusion rate. 
Study Procedure:
Initial Assessment:
Patients admitted from the ED to a progressive floor are eligible participants. 
Research staff will approach a convenience sample of patients admitted to the 
progressive floors based on screening of the electronic medical record. These 
patients are admitted to a progressive floor but approached by [CONTACT_182498] a room assignment. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_182489]-progressive inpatient units. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_182490]. Similar to other study subjects, these patients will be 
approached in the Emergency Department. If the patient agrees to participate in the 
IRB NUMBER: 2019-188
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/16/[ADDRESS_215565] will be consented by [CONTACT_16133]. Research staff will 
confirm functionality of the existing IV previously placed by [CONTACT_175302]. The 
assessment will include observing for blood return into the tubing upon aspi[INVESTIGATOR_182491]/or unobstructed flush with a minimum of 1-[ADDRESS_215566]. If the catheter is functional and 
free of any signs of complications, study subjects will be randomized by a computer 
generated 1:1 envelope system to either the control group: polyurethane dressing + 
clear tape or the experimental group: polyurethane dressing + clear tape + tissue 
adhesive. If the IV is not functional, a new catheter will be inserted in a new location, 
documented, and patient continues in the study. For the control group, the 
polyurethane dressing will be gently removed. Dressing will be removed carefully to 
minimize any potential dislodgments or skin injury. The site will be evaluated for 
oozing or blood and as needed cleaned with sterile gauze. Once the site is 
completely dry, a new polyurethane dressing will be applied and reinforced with 
tape in a standard fashion. See Appendix A for pi[INVESTIGATOR_182492]. Once securement is complete, functionality will be reassessed 
per protocol above. For the experimental group, the existing securement will be 
gently removed. The site will be evaluated for oozing or blood and as needed 
cleaned with sterile gauze. Once the site is completely dry, the tissue adhesive will 
be applied per directions in Appendix B. A new standard polyurethane dressing will 
be applied and tape will be applied per the standard approach. Once securement is 
complete, functionality will be reassessed per protocol above. The time of the new 
dressing application will be noted as time zero. Catheter dwell time will begin at this 
point. 
Additional data variables collected at the initial assessment include: demographics 
such as age, sex, INR>1.5, platelets < 50, insertion site details, hours from insertion 
to recruitment, inserter credentials.
Follow-up Assessment: 
After initial assessment, the catheter will be assessed by [CONTACT_182499] 24 
+/- 5 hours as long as the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182493] 7 days or 168 hours. At each 
follow up interval the researcher notes the date/time of evaluation and assesses for 
any signs and symptoms of complications and functionality of the device. A catheter 
is functional if the IV flushes without resistance. Catheters will be assessed daily for 
signs and symptoms of complications.11 See Appendix C for details regarding the 
assessment for complications. Any signs or symptoms of complications or lack of 
functionality will be reported to the patient’s primary care team so that 
management of the IV catheter can be addressed. If the catheter and adhesive are 
removed early due to catheter failure or complication, or for patient discharge prior 
to 7 days a medical adhesive remover may be used.
IRB NUMBER: 2019-188
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/16/[ADDRESS_215567] will be queried for all medications given 
through each catheter with specific attention to antibiotics and anticoagulants. 
Vesicants/irritants that are generally given via central line or considered caustic to 
the vessel will be noted in both groups. Number of doses will be recorded. See 
Appendix D for full list of non-neoplastic vesicants. 
Additional data gathered by [CONTACT_182500]-up evaluation includes: dwell 
time in days/hours, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], and number of peripheral IVs for 
duration of stay. 
Appendix E represents the data collection documentation tool for all catheter 
follow-ups. 
Statistical Rationale and Analysis Plan: 
Sample Size and Power Analysis 
For this randomly allocated two-groups experiment, the primary outcome is 
catheter survival associated with securement devices. Sample size calculation is 
based on primary outcome: composite or all cause premature removal due to 
complication of the IV catheter. Based on existing literature, the maximum mean 
failure rate across major investigations is 25% which functions as the estimated 
failure rate of the standard of care group.  Assuming a minimum difference of 10% 
needed for prompting a change in practice and based on existing literature, the 
experimental group  (standard of care plus tissue adhesive) is hypothesized to have 
a composite failure rate of 15%. 154 subjects per group for a total sample size of 
308 subjects is the minimum recommendation assuming a 10% dropout rate. To 
account for a larger dropout percentage, 350 patients or 175 subjects per group is 
the final sample size to provide 80% power to detect a significant effect.  
Statistical Analysis 
IRB NUMBER: 2019-188
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/16/2020
06.15.2020Characteristics of enrolled patients will be summarized using means [standard 
deviations] and medians [interquartile ranges] for continuous variables, and 
frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables. Exploratory data analyses 
including histograms, Pareto charts, scatter plots, and box plots will be further used 
to show the distribution. Appropriate transformations and estimation procedures 
will be performed as necessary. To test the effect of securement strategies on each 
of aims, we will further use Cox proportional hazard regression models for time-to-
event outcomes and logistic regression models for binary outcomes. P-values of less 
than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Analysis will be conducted 
using SAS 9.4.
 
Data Collection/Management Plan:
Data will be collected as subjects are enrolled and information will be stored in a 
password protected excel file until ready for statistical analysis. 
Publication and Presentation Plan:
The publication plan is to submit a manuscript to a high impact medical journal. 
This publication has the potential to significantly change securement practice and 
enhance quality for patients. The study results will also be presented at least one 
national meeting and potentially additional vascular access conferences. 
Potential Impact:
Optimization of peripheral vascular care is a critical strategy to improve patient 
outcomes and reduce health care costs. Enhanced dwell times will lead to improved 
patient/staff satisfaction, decreased interruptions in care with shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7491], and decrease in complications such as thrombosis, bleeding, and 
infection. At the Royal Oak campus, over 450,[ADDRESS_215568] of approximately $[ADDRESS_215569] our health system millions of dollars.

Point the tip towards the ceiling and away from the 
patient.  Press the bottom of the applicator upward.
Invert the applicator and gently squeeze the ridges to 
initiate adhesive flow. Place 1-2 drops of adhesive at the 
catheter-skin junction.
Allow each drop of glue to “set-up” for a few seconds 
before adding the next drop.
Make sure the tissue adhesive is surrounding the entire 
circumference of the catheter. 
Place an additional 1-2 drops of adhesive under the 
catheter hub/extension set connection.
  Apply gentle pressure for 30 seconds to ensure 
securement between the catheter and the skin surface.

1 BACKGROUND  
 
1.1 Palliative Radiotherapy  
 
Palliation of symptoms from metastatic cancer can be achieved by [CONTACT_442602]  (RT)1. Emergent conditions with established evidence for palliative RT include 
critical cancer -induced  symptoms such as hemoptysis2,3, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding4,5, 
pelvic bleeding6–9, bulky mediastinal disease  causing airway or vascular compression, and  
superior vena cava  (SVC)  syndrome2,10. Painful bony metastases may also require shor t 
courses of radiation to palliate symptoms that are refractory to narcotics. Oncology patients 
with these conditions frequently require inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. They  may have limited 
treatment options , given that such syndromes often indicate large burd en of metastatic 
disease and/or disease progression  despi[INVESTIGATOR_442592]. In this setting, RT can palliate 
symptoms and potentially mitigate life threatening symptoms  with minimal risk for 
toxicity.  
 
1.2 EBRT for Palliation  
 
External beam RT ( EBRT ) has long been  the approach of choice for such palliative 
treatments. The traditional workflow for a patient to receive palliative radiation using  
EBRT requires multiple steps  including consultation with a radiation oncologist, computed 
tomography ( CT) simulation  for radi ation therapy planning, quality assurance  of the 
planned radiation course , and final approval of the plan by [CONTACT_442603]. Given these numerous  important steps, multiple delays in the treatment planning 
workflow can o ccur and result in delays to start of RT for patients requiring urgent therapy.  
 
At our clinic, the scarcity of available appointment times for CT simulation would result 
in delay of RT planning and delivery. Since delays are unacceptable in treating urgent 
cases , these patients may start RT  without simulation , using  simplified radiation planning 
performed with manual calculations for the first one or two fractions of treatment , while 
an opening in the  CT simulation schedule is pending . These “clinical  set-ups” consume 
significant time from the treatment team and result in both dose uncertainty and workflow 
inefficiency. Even when CT simulation is successfully performed for patients requiring 
urgent palliative RT, delivery of treatment using conventiona l linear accelerators may be  
limited with regards to imaging guidance  for treatment setup accuracy . On board imaging 
for linear accelerators are limited to two -dimensional portal films or three -dimension al 
cone beam CTs both of which have difficulty in dis criminating various soft tissue densities.   
 
The combination of clinical set -ups with lack of CT simulation data and poor soft -tissue 
resolution with on board imaging leads to use of larger treatment volumes  to address spatial 
uncertainty, as well as dose uncertainty from manual calculations. This  subsequently 
increases risk of toxicity. This is especially significant if upfront palliative doses are to be 
followed by [CONTACT_442604]. Clearly, there  is a need for improvement in the 
radiation therapy workflow and image guidance for treatment delivery in  patients who 
require urgent palliative RT.  
 
Version 01/25/[ADDRESS_562220] with the use of magnetic resonance image -guided radiotherapy 
(MRgRT). MRgRT involves RT delivery using an integrated MRI, radiotherapy device, 
and dedicated treatment planning system. MRI -guidance is performed with a 0.35 Tesla 
imaging unit while treatment is delivered through an integrated Cobalt -60 radiotherapy 
device or linear accelerator (LINAC) . Imaging with MRgRT can be performed  daily , using 
a [ADDRESS_562221]  that is 
sufficient for real-time treatment planning and plan modification while the patient lies on 
the treatment table11,12. These daily treatment plans, typi[INVESTIGATOR_442593], are termed “adaptive radiotherapy” (ART). The MRI -guided 
ART treatment planning process includes  nearly all components of traditional treatment 
planning  for palliative RT , such as  volumetric imaging, target volume delineation by [CONTACT_24201], treatment plan generation, and quality assurance with an independent, Monte 
Carlo -based dose verification11,13.   
 
However, the traditional  treatment planning workflow for MRgRT  is limited by [CONTACT_442605] -treatment MRI and CT simulation imaging , which provide data to select 
appropriate beam geometry and electron density information for dose calculation. The 
standard of care for electron density calculation is a CT scan of the patient in the treatment 
position and immobilization device that will b e used for daily treatments. An ideal 
workflow for urgent palliative MRgRT would permit use of  same session -MR imaging to 
generate a treatment plan  while the patient is on the treatment table . In most instances, 
conventional u rgent palliative RT plans  use simple radiation beam a rrangements  and large 
field sizes to ensure target coverage. The traditional field arrangements are anterior -
posterior (AP) and posterior -anterior (PA) beam pairs,  regardless of tumor site , which may 
treat large amounts of norma l tissue . Use of pre -specified beam angles would mitigate the 
need for pre -treatment imaging to define beam geometry and improve the feasibility of 
creating the clinical plan in a time frame that is acceptable and tolerable for the patient to 
remain  on the  treatment table.  Further, MRgRT allows real -time gating of tumor motion, 
so a significantly smaller amount of normal tissue would be treated by [CONTACT_442606].  
 
Regarding CT -free treatment planning for MRgRT, some progress has been made towards 
this goal at other institutions. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin have used their 
MRgRT device for same -session simulation and treatment planning and delivery of the 
first fraction of 2D and 3D -conformal palliative spi[INVESTIGATOR_442594]. However, 
follo wing the first treatment fraction, patients then underwent traditional CT simulation 
and treatment planning  for treatment plan and dose verification ; ART was used only to 
expedite the first fraction.  
 
In such treatment planning, bulk density overrides have been  used to assign electron 
densities based on typi[INVESTIGATOR_442595] (bone, fat, lung, soft tissue)14. Bulk 
density overrides are an FDA -approved mechanism for dose extrapolation in MRgRT 
radiation planning, and can overcome the absence of CT density information15. Such 
overrides carry an anticipated dose uncertainty of <3%, which is considered acceptable 
especially in the setting of urgent palliative treatments16. For comparison, manual 
Version 01/25/[ADDRESS_562222] (the patient “separation”), without correction for 
heterogeneity of internal structure composition. This approach, although frequently 
utilized  in the first one to two fractions for urgent treatments, results in an average single -
fraction dose discrepancy between manually and computer -calculated dose of up to  10%, 
with uncertainty up to 25-30% for sites like the thorax where tissue density heterogeneity 
is substan tial17,18. Although this unce rtainty is then averaged out over the remaining 
treatment fractions following CT -simulation, the uncertainty of MR-only dose calculation 
using bulk density override  may indeed be an improvement upon the cumulative dose 
uncertainty  of a treatment course uti lizing manual calculations for one or more treatment 
fractions. Additionally, the < 3% dose uncertainty incurred using bulk density override for 
MR-only planning is well within the AAPM Task Group 141 recommendation of ± 5% 
cumulative dose uncertainty19. 
 
1.4 Rationale  
 
Given the availability of MRgRT technology and the growing clinical experience with MR -
only planning, w e propose to evaluate the feasibility of same -session MR -only simulation 
and treatment with  urgent palliative RT for patients with diagnosis of metastatic 
malignancy presenting with hemoptysis, GI bleeding, pelvic bleeding and bulky 
mediastinal disease /SVC syndrome . Although MRgRT has been used for palliative spi[INVESTIGATOR_442596] , this expedited same -session MR -only simulation 
and treatment  will include non -spi[INVESTIGATOR_407282] . This proposed study  is unique in that 
patients will not undergo  CT simulation at any point during their treatment cours e and will 
instead have same -session MR -only simulation and treatment planning, on -table, using the 
ART  workflow . In this manner, patients requiring urgent treatment c ould initiate treatment  
as early as the  day of initial radiation oncology consultation .  
 
 
2 OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
 
Demonstrate feasibility of same -session MRI -only simulation and treatment with MRI -
guided palliative radiation therapy for hemoptysis, GI bleeding, pelvic bleeding, and SVC 
syndrome / bulky mediastinal disease . Feasibility will be defined as more than 70% of 
patients  receiving at least 70% of their scheduled treatment fraction s on the first on -table 
attempt  for each respective fraction . 
 
2.2 Exploratory Objectives  
  
1. Determine the proportion of patients who complete planned course of palliative 
radiation therapy.  
2. Determine the on -table time required for each component of same -session MRI -only 
simulation and treatment with  plan generation for the initial treatment fraction and for 
subsequent treatment fractions.

3. Has had or will have a diagnostic CT for the region being treated.  
4. At least [ADDRESS_562223] be taken before registering patients to this study:  
 
1. Confirmation of patient eligibility  
2. Registration of patient in the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database  
3. Assignment of unique patient number (UPN)  
 
4.1 Confirmation of Patient Eligibility  
 
Confirm patient eligibility by [CONTACT_442607]:  
 
1. Registering MD’s name  
2. Patient’s race, sex, and DOB  
3. Three letters (or two letters and a dash) for the patient’s initials  
4. Copy of signed consent form  
5. Completed eligibility checklist, signed and dated by a member of the study team  
Version 01/25/[ADDRESS_562224] registered through the Siteman Cancer Center OnCore database.  
 
4.3 Assignment of UPN  
 
Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study.  All data 
will be recorded with this identification number on the a ppropriate CRFs.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_562225]  regimens:  
 8 Gy in 1 fraction  
 20 Gy in 5 fractions  
 30 Gy in 10 fractions  
 25 Gy in 5 fractions  
 37.[ADDRESS_562226] of treatment beams.  
 
5.3 Definitions  
 
 Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)  
 
The GTV will be defined as the visible gross tumor on the volumetric MR imaging 
obtained on the first day of treatment.  
 
 Clinical Target Volume (CTV)  
 
The treating physician may choose to define a CTV based on clinical judgement 
(margin that accounts for microscopic disease), but this is not required.  
 
Version 01/25/19   page 9 of 17 
 Planning Target Volume (PTV)  
 
If a CTV is created, the PTV is defined as a volumetric 5 to 10 mm margin 
expansion of the CTV  (to account for setup error).  If no CTV is created, the PTV 
is defined as a volumetric 5 to 20 mm margin expansion of the GTV.  
 
5.4 Same -session MR -only Simulation and Fraction 1 Treatment Planning  
 
All patients will need to be screened with an MR screening questionnaire with clearance 
by [CONTACT_442608]. Prescription dose per fraction will be chosen 
from the above doses at the discre tion of the treating physician . The protocol will not 
require segmentation of critical structures given the relatively low doses used during 
palliative radiation therapy. Coverage goal for the PTV will be for 95% of the volume to 
be covered by 95% of the d ose.  
 
On the day of Fraction 1, each patient will be planned based on their MRI volumetric image 
set obtained during simulation . A bulk density override method will be used to manually 
assign relative electron density values to the MRI  dataset for the purpose of dose 
calculation . Initial plan parameters  may be generated based on diagnostic imaging . For 
example, voxels representing the patient’s bones will be assigned an average bone density, 
voxels representing fat will have a different  density assignment, etc. On subsequent 
treatment fractions , another volumetric MRI image will be obtained on the treatment 
machine itself, and the plan will be adjusted based on anatomy and patient habitus of the 
day.  Previously assigned density values w ill be reviewed and adjusted if needed, after 
which the final clinical treatment plan will be created.   
 
5.5 Quality Assurance of the Daily Treatment  Plan  
 
Patient specific QA will be performed at each fraction prior to delivery of the treatment 
plan. Given t hat dose measurements will not be possible with the patient on the table, this 
will be achieved by [CONTACT_442609], using the exported beam parameters, and mapped electron density. The 
independ ently calculated dose distribution will be compared to the dose distribution 
exported from the MRgRT system, looking at dose volume histograms and 3D gamma 
analysis of all voxels within the patient. In addition, in -house plan integrity verification 
softwar e will be utilized to evaluate plan quality and integrity via plan parameters including 
contours, beam angles, segments, and monitor units. After completion of the automated 
checks, a final review by [CONTACT_442610] t delivery.  
 
5.6 Follow Up  
 
Patients will be assessed once per week in routine on treatment visits to assess for acute 
toxicity. All patients will undergo routine clinical follow -up with no protocol -required 
follow -up studies  after radiation therapy is complete .

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Sample Size Calculations  
 
Given this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_442599] , clinical considerations instead of 
power calculations were used to determine sample size. The primary objective will be to 
report feasibility of same -session MRI -only simulation and treatment with MRI -guided 
palliative radiation thera py for painful metastasis, hemoptysis, GI bleeding, pelvic 
bleeding, and SVC syndrome/ bulky mediastinal disease. The goal accrual will be 20 
patients. We are interested in precise estimates of feasibility of the proposed treatment plan, 
as well as outcome  variability that will aid in the planning of a larger, sufficiently powered 
efficacy trial.  A sample size of 20 will allow us to be relatively precise in our conclusions 
regarding feasibility outcomes.  For example, if we observe an 80% feasibility rate (i.e. [ADDRESS_562229] 70% of their scheduled 
treatment fraction for each respective fraction ), the 95% CI for that rate would be (62.5% 
- 97.5%).  Similarly, the secondary objectives do not require power c alculations.  
 
10.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_442600], >[ADDRESS_562230] 5 patients, or >[ADDRESS_562231] fraction of treatment , the trial will be suspended. 
Version 01/25/19   page 15 of 17 If at any time a grade 5 toxicity  (death) is observed that is probably or definitely attributable 
to treatment, accrual will be suspended and the event will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1961].  Since patients accruing to the trial have metastatic disease, it is anticipated 
that deat hs unrelated to the trial may be observed. Death that is felt to be either due to 
disease progression or patient comorbidity will not be scored as grade [ADDRESS_562232] 70% of their scheduled treatment fraction for each respective fraction with percentage 
in all patients recruited , and a 95% confidence interval will be generated . Feasibility will 
be defined as 70% of patients receiving at least 70% of their scheduled treatment fraction.  
Second, fraction  plans  will be divided  by [CONTACT_442613], low 
fractio n group and high fraction group. Median feasibility and range will be described for 
each group, and a Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be used to compare the feasibility among 
the two different fraction groups.

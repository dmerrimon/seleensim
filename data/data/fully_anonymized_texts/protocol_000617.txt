A Randomized, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_655757] -Treated HIV -Infected Adults  
 
DESIGN  This is a multi -center, randomi zed, open -label, two arm (phase II a) study . 
Eligible participant s on select antiretroviral therapy (ART) with  virologic 
suppression will be randomized to receive ruxolitinib  or no study treatment  
to measure safet y and tolerability and to determine whether there are 
changes in systemic immune activation and inflammation  after 5 weeks of 
treatment with ruxolitinib .   
 
DURATION  Participant s will participate in the  study for up to 12 weeks after 
randomization.  
 
SAMPLE SIZE  A total of 60 participant s will be enr olled in the study (40 on ruxolitinib 
[Arm A]; 20 on no study treatment [Arm B]). 
  
 The study aims to enroll at least 1 5 participant s on efavirenz ( EFV) in 
order to have at least 8 ruxolitinib -treated participant s to evaluate 
pharmacokinetic (PK)  interact ions with EFV.  
 
POPULATION  HIV-1 infected males  and females ≥  18 and < [ADDRESS_883051] 12 weeks  prior to study entry  containing either 
tenofovir /emtricitabine ( TDF/ FTC) or ab acavir /lamivudine ( ABC/ 3TC) plus a  
nonnucleoside re verse transcriptase inhibitor  or integrase strand t ransfer 
inhibitor  (NNRTI  or INSTI , not containing cobicistat)  who:  
 
 Are on ART for at least 2 years  
 Have virologic suppression defined as : (a) at least two HIV-1 RNA 
measurements < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL , one  of which was obtained within 336  
to 31 days , inclusive , prior to study entry and one obtained between 3 37 
and 730 days , inclusive , prior to entry, (b) no HIV-1 RNA values ≥ 50 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL within  336 days , inclusive , prior to study entry , and ( c) not 
more than one HIV -1 viral load equal to or greater than 50 and less than 
or equal to 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  from a result obtained between 3 37 and 730 
days, inclusive, prior to study entry  (and no HIV -1 viral load above 200 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/m L) 
 Have a plasma HIV -1 quantitative RNA with a lower limit of 
quantification  < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (e.g., < 40 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) obtained  ≤ 30 
days prior to study entry  
 Have CD4+ T cell count >  350 cells/mm3 within 30 days pri or to study 
entry  
 Have no other medical conditions, or concomitant medications, 
prohibiting the use of a janus activating kinase -signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (Jak -STAT ) inhibitor    
 
STRATIFICATION  To ensure balance by [CONTACT_655780], participant s will be stratified 
at randomization  based on their EFV status (i.e., whether they are on an 
EFV-containing  regimen).  
 
REGIMEN  TDF/FTC  or ABC/ 3TC + (NNRTI or INSTI , not containing cobicistat ), with

1.0 HYPOTHESE S AND STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Hypothes es 
 
1.1.1  The use of ruxolitinib for 5  weeks with antiretroviral therapy ( ART) consisting of: 
tenof ovir/emtricitabine ( TDF/ FTC) or abacavir /lamivudine ( ABC/ 3TC) + a 
nonnucleoside rev erse transcriptase inhibitor  or integrase strand transfer inhibitor  
(NNR TI or INSTI ) will be safe for vi rologically suppressed  participant s. 
 
1.1.2  The use of ruxolitinib f or 5 weeks with ART will be tolerable for virologically 
suppressed participant s.  
 
1.1.3  The use of ruxolitinib for 5 weeks with ART for virologically suppressed 
participant s will reduce systemic immune activation and inflammation.   
 
1.2 Primary Objective s 
 
1.2.1  To evaluate the safety of ruxolitinib in ART-treated HIV -1 infected virologically  
suppressed participant s during 5 weeks of treatment.  
 
1.2.2  To evaluate the tolerability of ruxolitinib in ART -treated HIV -1 infected 
virologically suppressed participant s during 5  weeks of treatment.  
 
1.2.3  To compare changes in interleukin -6 (IL-6) levels between baseline  and week 5  
in ART-treated HIV -1 virologically suppressed participant s who are randomized 
to ruxolitinib and those randomized to receive no study treatment . 
 
1.3 Second ary Objectives  
 
1.3.1  To evaluate the safety of ruxolitinib in ART -treated HIV -1 infected virologically 
suppressed participant s during all on-study visits  through week 12. 
 
1.3.2  To compare changes in IL -6 levels between baseline and week 12 in ART -
treated  HIV-1 virologically suppressed participant s who are randomized to 
ruxolitinib to changes in those participant s randomized to receive no study 
treatment.  
 
1.3.3  To assess whether the use of ru xolitinib will decrease levels of other measures of 
inflammatio n and immune activation  including  sCD14, tumor necrosis factor 
alpha ( TNF-α), IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-18, macrophage colony stimulating factor (m CSF), 
neopterin, HLA -DR, CD38, and both the distribution of monocyte subsets 
(defined by [CONTACT_389]14 + and CD16 +) and phenotypic indices of their 
activation during 5 weeks of treatment  and at week 12 . 
 
1.3.4 To examine whether the use of ruxolitinib is associated with changes in HIV -1 
plasma viral load levels (by a commercial clinical assay and single -copy assay) 
and CD4+ T cell counts in HIV -1 infected participant s at baseline compared t o 
12 weeks after initiation of treatment  for those receiving 5 weeks of ruxolitinib 
versus those receiving no study treatment .

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Background  
 
Although ART presents a viable and well -established strategy for treating individuals 
living with HIV -1, a limitati on of current ART is the inability to completely reduce systemic 
inflammation  to that seen in age -matched controls in the general population . This 
inflammation has several consequences for individuals on ART including: (1) 
establishment o f a systemic pro -HIV-[ADDRESS_883052]  in various microenvironments; (2) less robust immunologic reconstitution  [1]; and 
(3) increased end -organ damage.  
 
Primary myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative disease whereby [CONTACT_655781]. This fibrosis occurs due to stromal cell overproduction of 
collagen stimulated by [CONTACT_655782]. In response to the subseq uent 
pancytopenia, hematopoietic cells migrate out of the bone marrow resulting in 
extramedullary hematopoiesis and hepatosplenomegaly. A majority of patients with 
primary myelofibrosis have a somatic mutation in the gene encoding the cytoplasmic 
tyrosine kinase, Jak1/2, resulting in activation of Jak 1/2 signaling. Activation of the janus 
activating kinase and signal transducer and activator o f transcription ( Jak-STAT ) 
pathway leads to production of cytokines that cause the abnormal megakaryocytes to 
prolif erate. Ruxolitinib, a commerci ally available, US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved Jak [ADDRESS_883053] considered as a potential therapeutic option for HIV -
1 disease.  
 
 16 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/[ADDRESS_883054] from those  of traditional ART, including 1) 
nanomolar  in vivo  inhibition of TNF -α, IL-6, and other pro -HIV infla mmatory cytokines , 
which have been associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in ART -
suppressed HIV -1 individuals  [2, 3], 2) sub -micromolar (0.1 µM) inhibition of  IL-2, IL-6, 
IL-7, IL-15, or  interfer on (IFN)-α induced activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in primary  
CD4+ T cell lymphocy tes, 3) sub -micromolar inhibition  of HIV -1/2 replication in primary 
human lymphocytes and macrophages, 4) down -regulation of HIV -1 induced activation 
in primary human lymphocytes,  and 5) direct inhibition of the Jak -STAT pathway, which 
is activated early in HIV -1 infection [4].  
 
These attributes of ruxolitinib could address many of the limitations of existing ART and 
provide a novel mechan ism to  1) reduce  reservoir seeding and homeostatic proliferation, 
which is driven by [CONTACT_8668] -7 and IL -15 orchestrated proliferation of stem -cell memory T cells 
(TSCM) and other latent T cell subsets;  2) reduce systemic inflammation by [CONTACT_655783]-6 and oth er pro -HIV/pro -inflammatory cytokines, which would otherwise serve to 
promote pro -HIV-1 events including  (a) priming of uninfected cells for infection, (b) 
recruitment of uninfected cells to the site of infection, (c) reservoir maintenance  [5, 6], 
and to accelerate disease progression (including AIDS and serious non -AIDS events [ 7, 
8]; 3) reduce CD14 +/CD1 6+ monocytes and CD163 macrophages,  which can reduce 
trafficking of these activated, infected monocytes to the brain/ central nervous system 
(CNS ) where the y would otherwise either differentiate into macrophage -like cells 
containing HIV -1 or transfer infection to perivascular macrophages within the CNS  (this 
may also lead to a reduction in cardiovascular events via similar processes  [8, 9]), and 
4) confer ant i-HIV-1/2 potency across primary human lymphocytes and macrophages. 
Point 4 addresses persistent infection in macrophage -derived viral sanctuaries, which is 
not adequately controlled by [CONTACT_655784]  [10]. Additionally, as macrophages are long -lived cells that harbor 
virus, efficient inhibition of viral replication in these cells , and down -regulation of HIV -1 
induced activation (CD163) in these cells  by a mechanism distinct from direct inhibi tion 
of the viral replication cycle may provide a foundation to control inflammation -driven 
events including increased replication due to pro -inflammatory cytokines, induction of 
reactivation of virus from these cells, priming of uninfected macrophag es by 
[CONTACT_655785] m CSF, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_655758] (which promotes viral 
replication), and trafficking of infected myeloid l ineage cells to the brain  (driven by [CONTACT_10840]-1 
orchestrated activation of macrophages, w hich is marked by [CONTACT_655786]163  levels) . 
Together  the potential ability of ruxolitinib to address these unmet needs could (a) 
contribute to control of persistent infection, (b) limit reservoirs  maintenance,  and (c) 
prevent ongoing infection across and within tissue compartments. Although adverse  
effects (AEs) exist, administration of ruxolitinib to patients with CD4 + T cell counts ≥ 350 
cells/mm3, platelet cou nts >  200,000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥  750/mm3, 
and hemoglobin ≥  12 g/dL with close monitoring for AEs  should not present a ny greater 
risk to safety compared to  HIV-1 infected healthy participant s on ART . 
 
The HIV -1 reservoir is comprised of latently infected cells, predominantly central memory 
and transitional memory CD 4+ T cell lymphocytes  [11], that contain integrated HIV -1 
DNA. Integrated HIV -1 DNA can remain latent or be actively transcribed; the effect of 
ruxolitinib on this equilibrium is unknown. To assess the effects of ruxolitinib on the HIV -
1 reservoir, markers of HIV -1 production (plasma and cellular HIV-1 RNA levels,  2-LTR 
circles) and persistence (total and integrated HIV -1 DNA) can be measured and followed 
longitudinally. HIV -1 2-LTR circles are dead -end, non -integrated DNA species that are

FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/[ADDRESS_883055] 10 -12 years during 
suppressive ART [12], and it remains unclear whether they are a marker of ongoing HIV -
[ADDRESS_883056] -ruxolitinib administration, either in the abse nce or presence of ruxolitinib. 
These data would ultimately define whether selecti ve, systemic inhibition of pro -
inflammatory/pro -HIV cytokines could  result in partial or total inhibition of viral rebound, 
or a functional cure. The study  is designed to address the inflammation -driven facets of 
ART-suppressed HIV -[ADDRESS_883057] ore a novel therapeutic strategy that 
reduces cellular activation and sy stemic inflammation, targets Jak -STAT signaling 
across lymphocytes and macrophages, and ensures viable delivery across the blood -
brain barrier ( BBB) to eliminate the HIV -1 reservoir of  the CNS.  
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
HIV-1 continues to be a global health crisis with more than 34 million people living with 
HIV-1 worldwide (UNAIDS/WHO). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_655759], HIV -[ADDRESS_883058]. Although several mechanisms 
likely contribute to persistence during ART, the stable integration of HIV -1 DNA within 
resting CD4 + T cells and perhaps cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage is generally 
assumed to be the most important mechanism  [13]. All approved  ART drugs target steps 
in actively replicating virus, rendering them ineffective for 1) eliminating latent virus, 2) 
preventing or reversing reactivation of latent virus, 3) preventing recruitment of 
uninfected cells to the site of infection, and 4) inhib iting pro -HIV/pro -inflammatory 
cytokine milieus that drive chronic infection, disease prog ression, and end -organ 
damage. To this end, in the era of ART, it has become apparent that inflammation will 
continue to result in end -organ damage and eradication of  HIV-1 cannot occur without 
elimination of the latent viral reservoir . For these reasons, novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_66039].   
 
Role of Jak -STAT Pathways in HIV -1 Infection   
The transcriptional status of HIV -1 is tightly coupled to the acti vation state of its hos t cell. 
The phosphorylation state of Jak -STAT pathways is  known to influence HIV -1 infection 
in various target cells [14, 15]. HIV-1 orchestrated pro -inflammatory cytokines or 
envelope gp120 activates Jak  and STAT proteins  leading to expression of multiple 
receptors and/or cytokines and generalized immune dysfunction (including activation) in 
a variety of HIV -1 target cells, including primary human lymphocytes and macrophages 
[4, 8-9, 13 -19]. Cytokines that are upregulated and expressed in clude IL -6, TNF -α, and 
IFN-1α/β [20-23]. Inflammation, most notably associated with IL -6, can co ntribute to 
reseeding and maintenance  of the viral reservoir because IL -[ADDRESS_883059]-transcriptional step [ 24, 25]. 
 18 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/15 
 
Blocking Jak -STAT signaling pathways  could reverse or prevent HIV -induced activation 
of both macrophages and lymphocytes, thereby [CONTACT_289264] -orchestrated systemic 
immune activation and suppressing chronic inflammation. Consequently, HIV -1 
production from latently infected cells and HIV -1 infection of new target cells may 
decrease. Inhibition of these pathways may also reduce trafficking of virus and infected 
cells across the BBB, preventing CNS  persistence and HIV -associated neurocognitive 
disease. Since HIV -1 infection of macrophages causes  alterations in the cell cycle [26], 
chemotaxis [27], increased levels of TNF -α and other TH2 -type cytokines [28], 
phagocytosis [29, 30], and antigen presentation [31], inhibition of Jak -STAT pathways 
might have profound beneficial effects on these cells.  
 
Consequently, we anticipate that by [CONTACT_655787] -STAT si gnaling, the CD4 + T cell count 
could also increase ow ing to two primary mechanisms: 1) a reduction in HIV -1 
replic ation -dependent cell death and 2) a reduction in by[CONTACT_655788] -induced cell 
death independent of HIV -[ADDRESS_883060] mechanism relies upon the theory that 
there is ongoing HIV -1 replication in sanctuary sites despi[INVESTIGATOR_655760] [ 32-34]. In 
this setting, a reduction in pro -inflammatory cytokines could  result in fewer target cells 
trafficking to sites of infection, decreased ex pression of chemokine receptor type 5 
(CCR5 ) and other cellular activation markers that would otherwise make uninfected cells 
more permissive to HIV -1 infection, and fewer virus particles would be produced per 
HIV-1 infected cell.  
 
Monocytes/Macrophages as  a Reservoir for HIV -1 
Cells of the monocyte/ macrophage lineage have, as of yet, a poorly defined role in HIV -[ADDRESS_883061] shown a corr elation between 
activated, CD14 +/CD1 6+ monocytes and HIV -1-associated neuroco gnitive impairment, 
immune activation, higher viral loads , and disease progression [ 35-38]. In untreated HIV -
1 and possibly treated HIV -1 disease, carriage of HIV -1 across the BBB by [CONTACT_655789] , activated macrophages,  and lymphocytes establishes a persistent infection 
primarily in perivascular macrophages and microglia as viral reservoirs in the immune -
privileged CNS (the “Trojan horse” hypothesis) [22, 36, 39]. In contrast to HIV -1 infected 
CD4+ T cells, in fection in brain macrophages and microglia leads to an extended life 
span and increased survival in the presence of apoptotic stresses, while concomitantly 
orchestrating a pro -inflammatory cytokine milieu that drives viral replication in already 
infected c ells, primes uninfected cells for infection, and results in produc tion of reactive 
oxygen species  and other factors that drive HIV -associated neurocognitive impairments 
[20, 40-44]. In addition, viral proteins expr essed early in the viral replication cycle (such 
as Nef, Tat, and virion -associated Vpr) play a role in the formation of viral reservoirs in 
macrophages by [CONTACT_655790] [19].  
 
The BBB also consists of  a number of unique elements that prevent passage of many 
drugs into the brain (as also seen in lymphoid tissue). Several drug physical properties 
influence the penetration of drugs through the BBB, including molecul ar weight, protein 
binding, lipophilicity, and the action of passive and adenosine triphosphate  (ATP)-
dependent influx and efflux pumps [45]. Viral populations in the CNS can diverge fro m 
those of plasma due to the resulting differences in tissue drug exposures. Furthermore, 
the dynamic interaction between signaling pathways that promote virus replication, 
active/infiltrating macrophages, cytokines/chemokines, and secreted neurotoxic 
products, may interfere with the overall homeostatic regulation required to maintain 
normal quiescent brain function.  The ov erall mechanism of action of Jak  inhibitors and

HIV-1 events transpi[INVESTIGATOR_1312], in cluding 1) increased production of virus in already infected cells;  2) 
priming of  uninfected cells for infection;  3) recruitment of uninfected cells to the site of infection, 
therefore exposing them to infection  and priming them for infection;  4) activatio n of monocytes 
and macrophages, which promotes trafficking of these infected ce lls across and to the CNS/brain;  
and 5) microbial translocation in the gut (boxes above). Use of Jak inhibitors  prevents activation

Ruxolitinib   
The commercially available  Jak 1/2 inhibitor , ruxolitinib ( (3R)-3-cyclo -pentyl -3-[4-(7H-
pyrrolo  [2, 3-d]pyrimidin -4-yl)pyrazol -1-yl]propanenitrile; Jakafi , Incyte Corporation  and 
[COMPANY_001]), acts by [CONTACT_655791]. Ruxolitinib was approved 
by [CONTACT_655792] -risk myelofibrosis [48] 
and polycythemia vera . Other clinical trials are currently underway to determine its 
efficacy and safety for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  (RA), autoimmune  psoriasis , 
and various malignancies.  
 
In vitro studies performed at Emory University demonstrate antiviral potency of ruxolitinib 
in HIV -infected monocyte -derived macrophages (MDM) and lymphocytes grown in 20% 
serum. The EC 50/90 in macrophages was in the  range of 0.09/1.3 to 0.3/4.8 µM with and 
 21 A5336

IC50 (cellu lar toxicity) of 13.4 to >100. The EC 50/[ADDRESS_883064] on viability up to 50 µM  [49]. Furthermore, ruxolitinib has a short 
plasma t 1/2 (~3 hr), so that the dur ation of exposure to ruxolitinib is considerably shorter 
than in vitro exposure (5 days). Maximal plasma concentrations in humans (C max) are 
between 3.[ADDRESS_883065] for < 30 min [50, 51] demonstrating a wid e therapeutic 
window of safety.  
 
Ruxolitinib is a nanomolar in vivo inhibitor of TNF -α, IL-6, and other pro -HIV 
inflammatory cytokines (see Figure 2, based on p hase I/II and III clinical studies) [2, 3], 
and i s a direct inhibitor of the Jak -STAT pathway s activated early in HIV -1 infection [4]. 
Data provided by [CONTACT_655793] s treated with ruxolitinib for 
myelofibrosis (Study INCB 18 424-256) demonstrated t hat inhibition of pro -inflammatory 
and activation markers were observed within 2 weeks of administration of ruxolitinib 25 
mg twice a day ( BID), and in many cases were observed as early as [ADDRESS_883066] 
administration (Figure 4). Overall, ruxolitinib  is a promising drug  for further testing  as a 
modulator of inflammation  due to its well -documented safety profile and nanomolar ant i-
inflammatory action in humans  together with its sub -micromolar antiviral activity against 
HIV-1 in culture [50, 52].

phase reactant and a marker for inflammation, show in patients with > 50% decrease those with <  
50% decrease, and those with no c hange or an increase in the composite symptom score after 6 
cycles of treatment as compared with baseline, where y -axis is reported as “points” which is a 
change cytokine level versus baseline (A), or median change in IL -6 levels versus baseline 
(percent) (B).   
 
Safety of Ruxolitinib  
Over 9,[ADDRESS_883067] author of the clinical 
trials performed with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis, stated that their longitudinal study has 
not identified any new toxicities [50]. In his review, all published reports have shown 
satisfactory safety data on 1,400 participant s with no new toxicities [53]. 
 
In the initial dose -finding study of ruxolitinib in myelofibrosis  (Study INCB 18 424-251), 
the most common AEs  observed included hematologic (thrombocytopenia and anemia) 
and non -hematologic AEs  which were infrequent (br uising, dizziness, and headache) 
after a median of 14.7 months on therapy [2]. There were few Grade 3 or 4 events when 
 22 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/15 
 
using FDA -approved doses (15 mg BID or  20 mg BID depending on the platelet count 
and adjusted as needed for efficacy o r toxicity). Of the 153 participant s in the study, 
serious adverse  events (SAEs) occurred in 59 participant s, of whom on ly 12 had SAEs  
that were considered to be possibly relat ed to treatment. The hematologic events varied 
by [CONTACT_361502] (Table 2a). Diarrhea, fever , and urinary tract infections were 
described in 5.9%, 2% , and 2 .6%, respectively , for all grades  with only 0.7% having a 
Grade 3 or 4 fever. Individuals with H IV-1 were excluded from these studies.  
 
In the p hase III COMFORT -1 study in individuals with myelofibrosis (FDA dosing as 
above), there was a survival advantage when compared to placebo with 13 deaths in the 
ruxolitinib group (8.4% , N=155) and 24 deaths in  the placebo group (15.6% , N=154) 
during a median follow -up period of 51 weeks [3]. Among the deaths, there was no 
detectable increase risk of serious infections; pneumonia occurred in two  participant s 
who received  ruxolitinib and one  who received p lacebo, and sepsis occurred in two  
participant s from each arm. Although two  participant s developed  acute myelogenous  
leukemia  (AML) after receiving ruxolitinib, they were at increased risk for this disease 
prior to receiv ing the study drug. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 12.9% of 
the ruxolitinib arm an d 1.3% in the placebo arm with G rade 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_655761] 
2.6% of participant s in the ruxolitinib arm and 2.0% in the placebo arm; 1.3% of 
participant s in eac h arm ha d Grade 4 epi[INVESTIGATOR_34233]. There was one G rade 3 
event of bruising in the ruxolitinib arm. Thrombo cytopenia rarely recurred at a G rade 3 or 
4 level aft er appropriate dose reduction  and was not associated with an increase in 
bleeding events, al though bruising was more common in the ruxolitinib group. Grade 3 
or 4 anemia peaked at weeks 8 to 12 and then subsequently declined to levels similar to 
those in placebo -treated participant s.  
 
A longer term evaluation of  107 participant s enrolled in the open label, non -randomized 
phase I -II study of ruxolitinib  (INCB 18 424-251) showed that  49 (46%) discontinued 
ruxolitinib by 3 years (24 by [CONTACT_68089] 1, 36 by [CONTACT_68089] 2, and 46 by [CONTACT_68089] 3). Of those who  
discontinued treatment, only 3 (2.8%) did so for unacceptable toxicity. The others 
discontinued for progressive disease (12), withdrawal of consent (7), physician decision 
to discontinue (5), intercurrent illness (3), death (13), or other reasons (6). None of the 
deaths were considered by [CONTACT_093] s as related  to ruxolitinib , see T able 2 b. [52]. 
A cohort description in 120 Asian participant s treated for myelofibrosis with ruxolitinib 
was published online in late 2014 [5 4]. The authors concluded that, “Adverse events 
were consistent with those seen in the COMFORT studies.” The principal AEs were 
anemia, thrombocytopenia and diarrhea. Of 7 deaths that occurred in the cohort, one 
death due to sepsis and one due to hepatorenal syndrome were suspected by [CONTACT_614599] b e related to ruxolitinib treatment .

thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal cancer, renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, atrial 
flutter, headache, variceal bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, cholecystitis and 
bronchitis. In a second metastatic prostate cancer study, out of the [ADDRESS_883068] mult iple myeloma study, out of 20 participant s who received either ruxolitinib 
(N=13) or ru xolitinib plus dexamethasone (N= 7), there were three SAE reports of 
pneumonia, two reports each of gastrointestinal bleeding an d disease progression, and 
one report each of anemia, congestive cardiac failure, pericardial effusion, pyrexia, 
fatigue, pain, pneumococcal sepsis, urinary tract infection, overdose, hyperglycemia, 
lung cancer, seizure, pulmonary embolism , and hematoma. T he incidence of SAE was 
significantly higher in the ruxolitinib plus dexamethasone group versus ruxolitinib group. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)  [56], reactivation of latent 
tuberculosis  (pulmonary [ 57, 58] and disseminated [ 59, 60]), hepatitis B infection [ 61,

Polycythemia Vera Participant s Who Are Resistant to or Intolerant of Hydroxy urea: JAK 
Inhibitor INC424 (INCB018424) Tablets Versus Best Available Care: (The RESPONSE 
Trial)” . Many participant s in the  study did not demonstrate levels of IL -6 above the 
lower limit of detection (LLD) of 6 pg/mL at baseline. Therefore, at endpoint 
measurement, it was not possible to determine whether their IL -6 levels had decreased 
(Figure  5 below ). Considering only those participant s with elevated levels of IL -6 at 
baseline, four of six participant s demonstrated significant decreases in IL -6 levels 
(Figure 6  below). The participant s with a low baseline IL -[ADDRESS_883071] had a 
decline in IL -6 while on ruxolitinib but those changes would not be detected by [CONTACT_655797]. A more sensitive assay for IL -6 will be employed in A5336, with a LLD of 0.2 lo g10 
pg/mL (SD=0.25 log 10 pg/mL ). This will allow us to measure an effect for any 
participant s with a base line IL -6 above approximately 0.5 pg/mL.  
 
There are published data in myelofibrosis showing that symptomatic improvement for 
symptoms thought to be ca used by [CONTACT_655798], including n ight 
sweats, pruritu s and bone p ain are equally improved at doses of 10 mg BID as at highe r 
doses up to 25 mg BID. There is a clear drop off in symptomatic benefit when the dose 
is lower than 10 mg BID (g iven as 5 mg BID) , but even at that level there is improvement 
compared to placebo  [67]. Reductions in phosphorylated -STATs and Jak s at 10 mg BID 
are also observed in myelof ibrosis and RA  studies, each of which are surrogate markers 
for down regulation of IL-6 levels.

Pharmacology of R uxolitinib  
The FDA-approved starting dose is 20 mg given orally (PO) BID  for participant s with a 
platelet count >  200,000/mm3, 15 mg PO BID  for participant s with a platelet count of 
100,000/mm3 to 200,000/mm3, and 5 mg PO BID  for participant s with a platelet count 
between 50,000/mm3 and 100,000/mm3. Data from Incyte Corporation  have  shown that 
ruxolitinib can be dosed at 10 mg BID  with roughl y equivalent myelofibrosis efficacy and 
significantly reduced AEs compared to higher doses.  Dose reductions and subsequent 
dose increases in clinical trials and in the clinical setting are quite common with ra pid 
resolution of AEs  (and improvement in clini cal indicators). Similarly, titrating dose to 
effect is both recommended and commonly pract iced as well. Therefore, the protocol 
team has  chosen to use a dose of 10 mg BID  (without dose escalations) for all 
participant s in this  study and will exclude parti cipant s with plate let counts ≤  
200,000/mm3.  
 
Ruxolitinib is a substrate of CYP3A4, but not an inhibitor of this enzyme (see package 
insert). It is recommended that w hen administering ruxolitinib with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors, the total daily dose of ruxol itinib shoul d be reduced to 5 mg BID  (i.e., 
approximately 50% of the dose rounding up to the nearest dosage strength). No dose 
adjustment is necessary for mild or moder ate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see package insert). 
Raltegravir and other INSTI  are not substrat es for CYP3A4.  
 
Safety and Coadministration of EFV with Ruxolitinib  
Efavirenz is classified as a moderate CYP3A4 inducer  [68]. No dose adjustment is 
recommended when ruxolitinib is co administere d with a CYP3A4 inducer ( see package 
insert). However, plasma AUC values for ruxolitinib metabolites increased with 
  Upon removal of participant s who did not have elevated levels of IL -6 at start of 
study, an d consideration of only participant s with elevated IL -6 at baseline, it is 
clear that 10 -15 mg BID ruxolitinib reduces IL -6 levels by [CONTACT_5875] 4  
 
 28 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/[ADDRESS_883073] on the same  pharmacological receptors , however at lower 
potency (1/5 to 1/2 of the parent compound) and at relatively low concentrations. 
Therefore, when ruxolitinib is metabolized, the effect of the metabolite is between 20 -
50% of the original parent compound. Thus,  the contribution of toxicity resulting from an 
increase in drug metabolites would be mor e than compensated for by a net decrease in 
concentration of the parent drug.  The rates of  elimination half -life of ruxolitinib and its 
metabolites are rapid and similar  (approximately 3  – 5.8 hours ). Therefore, steady -state 
accumulation is not expected to  occur  (see more at:  
http://www.incyte.com/sites/default/files/Jakafi_PI.pdf?time=20141230135651 ). The 
dose sele cted for this study is 10 mg BID , which is the recommended reduced dose  and 
is below or equivalent to package insert guidelines when considering metabolites of 
ruxolitinib in the presence of EFV.   
 
The mass bala nce trial INCB [ZIP_CODE] -134 reported  that following a single 25 mg dose of 
ruxolitinib s olution (100 μCi 14C -ruxolitinib) parent drug was the predominant entity in 
circulation, representing 58% to 74% of the total radioactivity between [ADDRESS_883074] -
dose. Metabolite M18 was observed at 17% of the total, circulating, drug -related material 
based on AUC and the other observed ruxolitinib mono - and di -hydroxylated and ketone 
metabolites rep resented less than 10% (Figure 7). Eight of these metabolites (M7, M8, 
M9, M11, M14, M16, M18 , and M27) when added to parent drug, accounted for greater 
than 9 0% of the drug -related material in circulation (based on AUC). No metabolites 
were observed in human plasma after [ADDRESS_883075] -dose.

Justification for Choice of IL -[ADDRESS_883076] strongly associated with cardiovascular disease 
(CVD)  and mortality (odds ratio for 4th/1st quartile of 3.5 and 11.8 for CVD and mortality, 
respectively) [ 69, 70]. These results were confirmed in a large anal ysis of a ll treated 
participant s in the INSIGHT families (which included ESPI[INVESTIGATOR_655762], n=3766), 
a single determination of IL -6 was associated with disease progression over the 
subsequent 5 to 8 years. The prognostic significance of IL -6 in treated HIV -1 disease 
was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of participants  in ALLRT and a case -control 
study from participant s enrolled in SOCA/SCOPE [ 71, 72]. A number of other studies 
have confirmed that IL -6 is higher than expected in treated HIV -1 disease [ 73-75], and 
associated with poor prognosis [ 8, 76, 77]. The impact of IL -6 on prognosis is generally 
not attenuated after controlling for viral load, CD4+ T  cell count , and other factors. To our 
knowledge, there is no other biomarker which has been so consistently associated with 
disease progression in the context of treated HIV -[ADDRESS_883077] been associated with increased IL -6 levels coincident with an  ruxolitinib

  05/21/[ADDRESS_883078] as a surr ogate marker of 
inflammation [7] but as an earlier predictor of disease progression [78]. 
 
In order to assess feasibility, we examined participant s who were analyzed as part of 
NWCS 329 , wherein participant s from seve ral ACTG trials were followed  for 
cardi ovascular and malignant endpoints. Cases and controls were selected based on 
these particular outcomes . Among the 171 controls with viral load < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and 
CD4+ T cell > 350 cells/mm3 at 1 year after ART initiation, the following IL -6 quartiles 
were identified:  
 
Quartile 1 (25%):  IL-6 < 0.86 
Quartile 2 ( 26%):  IL-6 = 0.86 to 1.42  
Quartile 3 ( 20%):  IL-6 = 1.43 to 2.0  
Quartile 4 ( 29%)  IL-6 ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_883079] measured plasma levels of IL -6 using the R&D high sen sitivity assay. This is a 
solid-phase sandwich ELISA  that can be performed on serum or plasma. In this ass ay, 
the LLD  is usually around 0.16 pg/mL, and the assay range is 0.11 pg/mL -10 pg/mL. The 
manufacturer reports that there is <  0.5% cross -reactivity observed with molecules 
related to IL -6. Using thi s assay, it was reported [63] that among 60 participant s with 
virologic control and immune failure (CD4+ T  cell < 350/uL), 20 participant s with 
virologic control and immune success (CD4+ T  cell > 500/uL) and 21 healthy controls, 
none had IL -6 levels in plasma  lower than 0.46 pg/mL. Samples are obtained in EDTA 
and processed and cryopreserved within 6 hours of blood draw. Assays are performed 
on cryopreserved samples using manufacturer’s instructions and inter -assay consistency 
is evaluated by [CONTACT_655799] t of the same sample on each plate. Thus we are 
confident that our assay is sensitive enough to measure IL -[ADDRESS_883080] the HIV -1 reservoir.  
 
Overall, the potential mechanisms impacted by [CONTACT_655800]:  
 
1. Seeding of the HIV -1 reservoir: Recent  data (Figure 8) and others show that γ -C 
receptor cytokines (IL -2, IL-7, IL-15) which are triggered by [CONTACT_40328]  T cell receptor  
(TCR) activation and by[CONTACT_655801] (bacterial translocation, alarmins) 
can upregulate HIV -1 transcription and production . This is  because  the sequence of 
the HIV -1 LTR includes STAT  binding sites [5, 79]. This ultimately results in 
increased numbers of infected cells, increased production of viral particles and an 
enhanced seeding of the H IV reservoir. Inhibition of Jak -STAT signaling pathways 
should decrease the number of HIV -1 infected cells and ultimately the HIV -1 
reservoir.  
 
 31 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/15 
 
2. Maintenance of the HIV -1 reservoir: W e have shown that IL -7 (a γ -C receptor 
cytokine) maintains and expands the latent HIV -1 reservoir by [CONTACT_655802] [5]. Inhibition of homeostatic proliferation downstream of cytokines such 
as IL-7 and IL -15 should result in a decreased expansion/maintenance  of the latent 
HIV-1 reservoir.  
 
3. Inhibition of cytokine induced inflammation driven HIV -1 replication and T cell  
dysfunction/exhaustion: Several pro -inflammatory cytokines, which are upregu lated 
in HIV -1 infection, enhance HIV -1 replication as they can activate T cells  thereby 
[CONTACT_655803]5 and trafficking of these cells to sites of infection ; they 
also inhibit T cell and innate immune function as these cytokines upregulate t ype I 
interferons (IL -7, IL-15) and  several negative regulators of T cell activation (PD -1, 
Lag-3) and their ligands (PDL -1, MHC II) in individuals with HIV -1. This should 
induce HIV -1 latency in cells expressing these molecular factors [5, 22, 79, 80]. 
 
4. Inhibition of Jak -STAT may prevent the induction of an HIV -1 latent pool by  
[CONTACT_655804] T cells and their ligands on innate 
immune cells. This could result in the restoration of innate and adaptive immune 
function, two critical steps in controlling or eliminating latently infected cells and a  
functional cure  [81].

only, reported in µM (x -axis).  
 
Infectious HIV -1 reservoir measurements us ing a quantitative virus outgrowth assay (Q -
VOA) may underestimate reservoir size [82] and require larger volume blood draws than 
are feasible in this study. We plan to use total and integrated HIV -1 DNA levels as 
markers of HIV -1 persistence and plasma HI V-1 RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells ( PBMC )-associated HIV-1 RNA and 2-LTR circles as markers of HIV production. 
Measurement of plasma virus load , cellular RNA  and 2 -LTR circles will examine two 
different components of HIV -1 replication: the amou nt of virion production that may occur 
during ruxolitinib therapy and the degree to which virions may infect cells and yet fail to 

 32 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/[ADDRESS_883081] 
quantification will corroborate changes that may be observed in total HIV -1 DNA, relative 
to integrated HIV -1 DNA, during ruxolitinib therapy.  
 
Activation of Viral Co-infections  
Previous studies reported  reactivation o f herpes  viruses among participants  
receiving ruxolitinib for clinical indications; however, the use of other 
immunosuppressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_655763] [83, 84]. As part of this study we will deter mine whether 
the use of ruxolitinib is associated with more frequent reactivation of human HHV 
as measured in longitudinally collected oral swabs. Shedding of HHV DNA is 
frequently detected in saliva of healthy individuals and more frequently in HIV -
infect ed adults and persistent replication of HHV  (in particular CMV) was 
repeatedly associated with increased systemic inflammation and cellular 
activation [85, 86, 87]. As an alternative hypothesis, since persistent inflammation 
can also be a trigger for HHV r eactivation, reduction in inflammation after 
ruxolitinib administration might be associated with decrease in HHV repl ication .  
 
If treatment with ruxolitinib is associated with increased oral shedding of HHV, we 
will determine whether  the presence of enhan ced sub -clinical HHV replication 
might in turn affect the ability of this immuno -modulatory intervention to reduce 
inflammation during suppressive ART. Also, if increased reactivation occurs, then 
measures of asymptomatic HHV replication should be consider ed as a possible 
safety measure for future studies.  
 
Potential Impact of this Clinical Trial  
Chronic inflammation and immune activation promote end -stage organ disease leading 
to decreased survival in virologicall y suppressed individuals on ART. To date,  
interventions to mitigate this process are severely  lacking. Inhibition of the Jak -STAT 
pathway using a FDA -approved agent, ruxolitinib, provides an unprecedented 
opportunity to significantly attenuate levels of inflammation and such an approach may 
restore  the immunologic b alance. We hypothesize that Jak -STAT inhibitor treatment will 
result in higher CD4 + T cell counts as well as  lower levels of immune activation and 
chronic inflammation. We expect to observe decreased immune activation that will 
persist fo llowing discontinuation of ruxolitinib. We also posit that by “resetting” the 
immunologic balance in favor of less immune activation and inflammation, this 
immunologic milieu will persist in the absence of ruxolitinib. Since l ower levels of 
immune activati on and chronic inflammation have been associated with fewer AIDS and 
serious non -AIDS clinical events , we anticipate that long term use of  ruxolitinib could 
provide a tangible clinical benefit , i.e., increased event -free survival . Furthermore, we 
have show n in vitro that ruxolitinib has specific anti -HIV-1 properties even in resting 
CD4+ T cells and monocyte/macrophages, and can reduce homeostatic proliferation , 
which we expect will result in a decline of the HIV -[ADDRESS_883082] on the HIV -1 reservoir.  
 
Justification for Proceeding with Studies in Humans with HIV -1 
Presently studies of ruxolitinib are being conducted on non -human primates (NHP)  
infected with simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV) (both viremic and virologically 
 33 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/15 
 
suppressed  on ART ). However, there is no guarantee that the PKs, safety profile , and 
efficacy of ruxolitinib in these models will correlate with humans infected with HIV -1.  
 
The dose selected for the NHP /SIV study is significantly lower than that which has 
already been dosed in other NHP  studies (Incyte Corporation  data). The dose being 
used in the NHP/ SIV study is also ca lculated to mirror the [ADDRESS_883083] 
not been conducted previously. The dose selected herein for the  NHP study is designed 
to provide a balance between what we know is well tolerated in humans, and a safe level 
relative to what has  been dosed in NHP previously. More specifically, the dose to be 
used in the NHP  study has been calculated using the publis hed single dose PK  of 
ruxolitinib in NHP , allowing for mathemati cal scaling of NHP  dosing to match plasma 
PKs observed in humans for 10 mg BID dosing.  
 
The data obtained could provide a proof -of-principle for reduction in SIV or HIV induced 
inflammation and activation, but species  and virus differences dictate that results should 
not be used to modify human clinical studies. Differences between the SIV infected NHP   
model and humans, such as virus (HIV versus  SIV), cellular factors, co receptors/  
receptors, and generalized cross -species differences, dictate that this pi[INVESTIGATOR_655764]. 
  
The NHP pi[INVESTIGATOR_27975]  a total of four rhe sus macaques with viral loads >  200,000 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL , which wer e treated with 2.2  mg/kg ruxolitinib BID  via oral administra tion for a 
total of 6  weeks. Two monkeys were  administered add -in HAART [( -)-FTC, PMPA, and 
Kaletra] starting at week [ADDRESS_883084] dose of ru xolitinib, 
blood s amples were  collected at baseline (befo re drug), and 1, 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_883085] 
admini stration for PKs . Blood samples were  tested  once a week , thereafter , and plasma 
collected during the remainder of the stud y (6 weeks total). Samples (3 mL ) were  
aliquoted to collect whole blood (for measuring of integrated viral DNA in PBM Cs, 
monocytes and macrophages and cell associated immunology markers , e.g., D16, 
CD16 3, Ki67, HLA -DR, CD25, and CD38 . Plasma samples have been  stored at -70o C 
before being assayed to dete rmine concentratio ns of ruxolitinib, ( -)-FTC, PMPA , and 
Kaletra, and soluble activation markers , e.g., sCD14, IL -6, IL-1/b. CSF was  collected 
once per week to measure drug levels and viral loads.  
 
The safety profile of ruxolitinib in individuals with myelo fibrosis has been well -
documented and FDA -approved for this indication. Emerging data have shown that even 
fewer AEs have been reported in individuals without myelofibrosis (solid  tumors and 
RA). We believe that the population of individuals living with HI V-1 who would be eligible 
for this study is immunologically and hematologically “healthier” than individuals with 
myelofibrosis and therefore should have few AEs.  
 
Justification for the Participant  Population Selected  
 
Virologically Suppressed on ART  
In order to assess the impact of ruxolitinib on chronic inflammation and systemic immune 
activation, it was important to exclude the impact of ART on these same markers 
through mechanisms dependent on and independent of viral replication.

FINAL  Version 2.0

Age and CD4+ T Cell Criteria  
In order to minimize AEs associated with ruxoli tinib, we chose a participant  population 
with an adequate CD4 + T cell -count and within a safe age range , ≥ 18 to < 75. 
Furthermore, the immune sys tem of adults and children of ages outside of this ran ge 
behave differently , which could introduce additional confounders into the efficacy 
assessment.  
 
Exclusion of Pregnant Women  
Ruxolitinib has been designa ted pregnancy category C. In animal studies, treatment with 
ruxolitinib resulted in an increase in la te resorptions and reduced fetal weights at 
maternally toxic doses.  There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of ruxolitinib 
in pregnant women.  
 
Exclusion of Participant s with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) 
Infection  
Accor ding t o Incyte  Corporation , there are only five  participant s with HBV infection and 
no participant s with HCV inf ection who received ruxolitinib. Additionally, two case 
reports of HBV reactivation in individuals receiving ruxolitinib for myelo fibrosis were 
publis hed [ 61, 62 ]. Therefore , it was recommended that participant s with HBV infection 
or HCV infection be excluded from this study . 
 
Risk Benefit Assessment  
Ruxolitinib may have side effects, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, fever, 
infections, and fatigue and could resu lt in changes of ARV  concentrations. There are 
also risks associated with phlebotomy such as discomfort, bleeding, bruising and/or 
inflammation plus a small risk of infection. It is not known if ruxolitinib causes harm to the 
fetus. B y using a low dose of ruxolitinib , short treatment  duration , and choosing a 
population that has higher CD4 + T cell counts and that is not pregnant, we feel these 
risks have been minimized. This study is intended to explore how ruxolitinib could impact 
the immune system for individuals with virologic suppression on ART. There is no 
anticipated benefit for participants participating in this study. Information learned 
from this study may help others who have HIV -[ADDRESS_883086] of this study, refer to the section “Potential Impact of This Clinical Trial”  (see

3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
A5336 is a randomized, open -label, prospective, 2 -arm (phase IIa) study that will enroll 
60 HI V-1 infected participant s (≥ 18 to < 75 years of age) who have been virologically 
suppressed fo r at least 2 years  (defined below  in section 4.1.3 ), have CD4+ T cells >  
350 cells/mm3 ≤ [ADDRESS_883087] plasma  HIV-1 RNA below the 
limit of detection ≤ 30 days prior to entry. Participant s will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio 
to either Arm A (treatment with ruxolitinib) or Arm B ( no study treatment ) (40 and 20 in 
the ruxolitinib and no study treatment arms, respectiv ely). Participant s in Arm A will 
receive treatment with ruxolitinib 10 mg BID for 5 weeks. Based upon the mechanism of 
action for ruxolitinib, it is not expected that the plasma viral load will increase. However, 
as a safety precaution, participant s will b e monitored for changes in HIV -1 viral load. If 
changes in inflammatory markers are observed  and/or if there are advances in the field

which might provide further rationale for assessing the virologic endpoints in the 
absence of achieving the desired immun ologic outcomes , we will assess for changes in 
the HIV -1 reservoir (specifically plasma HIV -1 RNA by [CONTACT_245142], cellular HIV-1 
RNA and total DNA , 2 LTRs , and integrated DNA).  Refer to section 6.1, Schedule of 
Events  (SOE) , for specific evaluations  and time points. Participant s in Arm A will be 
followed for [ADDRESS_883088] or HIV enzyme or 
chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry 
and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody t est by a method 
other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by [CONTACT_10840] -1 antigen,  or historical 
plasma HIV -1 RNA viral load . 
 
NOTE: The term “licensed” refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which i s required for 
all IND studies.  
 
WHO (World Health Organizatio n) and CDC (Center s for Disease Control and 
Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must 
use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive 
initial rapid test should be confirmed by [CONTACT_655806] 
E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test 
principle ( eg, indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV -1

(LDL).  If the LDL cannot be calculated due to elevated triglyceride levels, a 
direct LDL should be measured.  
 
Pregnancy Tes ting 
For women with reproductive potential: Serum or urine -HCG (urine test must 
have a sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL).  
 
6.3.10 Nadir CD4+ T cell Count  
 
The participant ’s prior nadir CD4+ T cell count (absolute value and date) should 
be documented when possibl e with a copy of the nadir CD4+ T cell count report. 
If this documentation is not available, then participant  recollection will suffice. 
For participant s who do not know the exact nadir value and for whom there is 
no source documentation, then recall of  the categorical nadir (e.g., <  50, <  100, < 
200 cells/mm3) will suffice.    
 
6.3.11  Documentation of Pre -ART CD4+ T cell Count  
 
Record on the CRF  the documented date and level of the participant ’s pre-ART 
CD4+ T cell count that w as obtained most immediately p rior to a participant ’s 
initiating ART.  If documentation is not available, then participant  recollection will 
suffice.  
 
6.3.12  Immunologic Studies  
 
CD4+/CD8 + 
At screening, pre-entry and for all on -study evaluations o btain absolute 
CD4+/CD8+ count and perc entages from a laboratory  that possess es a CLIA 
certification or equivalent  and is certified for protocol testing by [CONTACT_654089] (IQA) Program.  Note only one CD4+/CD8+ 
value is needed if the screening and pre -entry visits are com bined.  
 
Because of the diurnal variation in biomarkers that may be measured as part of 
the study (e.g., CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and other biomarkers that may be 
measured on stored samples), blood draws for individual participant s should be 
performed co nsistently in either the morning or the afternoon throughout the 
study, if possible.

7.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
7.1 Toxicity  
 
Only toxicitie s related to the study  drug , (ruxolitinib ,) will be considered in the toxicity 
management sectio n. The grading system is located in the Division of AIDS Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), 
Version  2.0, November 2014 , located at the DAIDS R SC Web Site: http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/  
 
NOTE:  The study core team must be notified by e -mail regarding toxicities that result in a 
change in regimen  or discontinuation of study treatment  ([EMAIL_12492] ).   
 
7.1.1 Grade 1 or 2  
 
Participant s who develop a Grade 1 or 2 AE or toxicit y may continue study drug  
without al teration of the dosage, except as stated in sections 7.2.1 to 7.2.8 . For 
participant s experiencing Grade 1 or 2 AEs who choose to discontinue study 
drug, the site investigator should complete premature treatment discontinuation 
evaluations, and the partici pant  should be encouraged to complete evaluations 
off treatment/on  study . 
 
NOTE:   If participant s discontinue study drug  due to experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_883130] their study medication  discontinued . If the investigator has 
evidence that the AE has NOT  been caused by [CONTACT_5349] , study drug should 
be held until the AE or clinically signific ant laboratory ab normality is  Grade 
≤ [ADDRESS_883131] be permanently discontinued.  
 
Participant s experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring pe rmanent dis continuation of 
study drug  should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and should 
complete the premature treatment discontinuation evaluations  and should be 
encouraged to complete off treatment/on study evaluations.

participant  should be encouraged to complete off treatment/on study 
evaluations.  
 
7.2 Other Toxicities  
 
7.2.1 Platelet Count R eductions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If a participant  develops a platelet count decrease  of >25% from 
baseline with an absolute value remaining above 200,000 /mm3, then 
dosing can continue.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If the platelet count decreases from baseline by ≥ 25%, and the absolute 
value is between 150,000 -200,000 /mm3, then dosing of the study drug 
should be reduced to 10 mg QD. The CBC should then be repeated 
weekly until the platelet count either returns to >  200,000 /mm3 or 
remains less than 10% below the value that led to the dose reduction  for 
two consecutive values . If the platelet count returns > 200,000 /mm3, and 
is > 1.[ADDRESS_883133] two consecutive values . 
After resumption of the BID dosing if the platelet count decreases to <  
200,000/mm3, then the dose will be decreased to  10 mg daily and 
remain at that dose except as noted in section 7.2.3.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If the platelet count decreases by ≥ 25%, and an absolute value below 
150,000/mm3, then the stud y drug should be discontinued. The CBC 
should then be repeated weekly until the  platelet count returns to >  
150,000 /mm3.   
 
7.2.2 Anemia/Neutropenia  
 
If a participant  experiences treatment -limiting  Grade 3 or higher decrease (in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_91382])  in anemia or neutropenia, then study  drug 
should be withheld. Anemia  should not be managed by [CONTACT_655818], and neutropenia should not  be managed with 
granulocyte -colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) or granulocyte -macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF) . Once the anemia or neutropenia has 
returned t o Grade ≤  2, the study drug  can be restarted.  
 
7.2.3 Creatinine Clearance  
 
Any participant  experiencing a calculated CrCl <  60 mL/min should have the 
value confirmed within 7 days. For those participant s who experience a 
confirmed (2 consecutive)  CrCl < 60 mL/min, study drug should be withheld.  If 
the site investigator determines that another condition caused the d ecrease in 
CrCl, then study drug may be restarted if approved by [CONTACT_133047]. 
Participant s should be followed as medically indica ted until the serum creatinine 
 56 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/15 
 
returns to Grade ≤ 2 or baseline.   
 
7.2.4 Bruising  and Bleeding  
 
For participant s who report generalized bruising  and/or symptoms of 
unexplained or abnormal bleeding, hematoma or epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] , the study drug 
should be discontinued.  
 
7.2.5 Nausea (with or without vomiting) an d/or Diarrhea  
 
With the onset of Grade ≥  1 nausea  advise participant s to take study drug  with 
food. Participant s may also be treated as need ed with antiemetics given PO  or 
by [CONTACT_124773].  
 
In participant s with persistent nausea, consideration should be giv en for 
evaluation of pancreatitis, hepatitis, or hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, with 
evaluation for each if clinically indicated.  
 
For Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea, therapy should be continued with symptomatic 
treatment with antimotility agents. If Grade ≥  3 diarrhea occurs and is 
unresponsive to antimotility agents, and for which an alternative etiology (e.g., 
infectious diarrhea) is no t established  and judged related to study drug , study 
drug should be withheld  until resolution of diarrhea to G rade ≤ 1 or retu rn to 
baseline. If Grade ≥  3 diarrhea recurs upon the resumption of the stu dy drug, 
study drug  should be discontinued.

9.2.3  Exploratory Objective Measures  
 
Summary measure of immune activation and inflammation and how changes in 
this measure differ between treatment groups.  
 
9.3 Randomization and Stratifi cation  
 
At study entry, participant s will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio (ruxolitinib: no study 
treatment ) using permuted blocks, without institutional balancing.  Participant s will be 
stratified based on whether they take EFV or do not take EFV at screening, in order to 
ensure balance by [CONTACT_655780].  
 
9.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
The sample size for A5336 was determined based on the primary endpoint for change in 
IL-6, while at the same time ensuring the sample size was feasible for an early phase 
investigation of the safety of ruxolitinib.  
 
9.4.1  Changes in IL -6 
 
A total sam ple size of 60 participant s will be  randomized at a 2:1 ratio to 
ruxolitini b:no study treatment , allowing for 20% lost  to follow -up and treatment 
discontinuation, is anticipated t o yield 48 evaluable participant s (see section 
9.6.1) . This will provide 80% power to de tect a treatment effect of 0.20 log 10 
pg/mL, that is a difference between treatment groups in  (change in plasma IL -6 
from entry to week 5), assuming that the standard d eviation (SD) of within -
participant  differences in IL -6 is 0.25 l og10 pg/mL , using a two -sided t -test at a 
0.10 alpha level.   
 
To minimize variability and maximize statistical power, at each key time point 
markers will be measured and analyzed as the aver age of samples taken 1 -2 
weeks apart (pre -entry and entry; at weeks 4 and 5; at weeks 10 and 12).  
 
 61 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/[ADDRESS_883140] of 0.20 log 10 scale pg/mL  corresponds to a verage decreases 
of 37% and 0%  in plasma IL -[ADDRESS_883141] size is based on prior data examining 
plasma IL -6 levels in HIV -1 infected populations and changes in IL -6 levels in 
ruxolitinib treated populations. Specifically, a 27% (95% confidence interval [ CI]: 
11% to 39%)  reduction in IL -6 levels after 4 weeks and a 37%  (95% CI: 13% to 
53%) reduction after 24 weeks of treatment was seen in  the Phase III 
COMFORT -1 study [3]. The effect size of 37% is selected because it is contained 
in the 95% CI for IL -[ADDRESS_883142] in the 
efficacy endpoint with safety considerations as well as feasibility for this early 
phase investigation of the effects of the study treatment in the HIV -1 population.  
 
The assumed SD for within -participant  differences in  IL-6 of 0.25 log 10 is a 
pooled estimate  based on estimates of the  between -participant  SDs and within -
participant  correl ation from other ACTG studies. ACTG 5248 estimated the  
between -participant  SD of IL -6 at weeks 24 and 48 (after starting ART 
treatm ent); the SD was  0.335 at week 24 (based on 35 participant s) and 0.331 
at week 48 (based on 29 participant s). The SD estimate from 311 controls from 
NWCS 329 at week 48 was 0. 306 based on a single measure [ 71]. In addition, 
ACTG 5286 reported the within -partici pant  correlation between baseline and 
week 4 IL -6 measures to be 0.68 (n=43). Two versions of the pooled SD were 
calculated assuming the same SD at baseline and weeks 5, one assuming both 
SDs = 0.306, and the other assuming both SDs = 0.331. Each set of SD s was 
then pooled by [CONTACT_655822] (r = 0.68), 
which resulted in SD=0.2448 and SD = 0.2648, respectively. The pooled 0.25 SD 
is the average of these values.  
 
9.4.2  Safety  
 
The total sample size of 60 participant s will be randomized at  a 2:1 ratio to 
ruxolitinib: no study treatment  ratio, results in 40 participant s receiving ruxolitinib 
and 20 receiving no study treatment . The 40 ruxolitinib -treated participant s will 
provide 90% probability of observing an AE that would o ccur in 6% or more of 
treated participant s. 
 
We assume the rate of events (outlined in [IP_ADDRESS]) in the no study treatment arm 
will be no more than 2%. Assuming this rate in the no study treatment arm, we 
will have 80% power to detect a significant differen ce between the two arms, via 
a one-sided Fisher’s exact test with 5% alpha, if the rate in the ruxolit inib arm is 
27%.

summary will be pooled over the study arms. Baseline characteristics, early study 
treatment and study discontinuations, and virologic failures, pooled over study arms, will 
be reviewed r egularly by [CONTACT_133047]. In addition, data and specimen avai lability 
will be also regularly reviewed.  The Statistical and Data Analysis Center (SDAC) will also 
prepare quarterly reports o f all Grade ≥ 2 events, and all reported AEs by [CONTACT_655824], to 
be reviewed  by [CONTACT_655825].  
 
An ACTG -appointed Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review a ccrual, toxicity 
summaries, off-treatment and off -study rates, and  reasons broken down by [CONTACT_68400].   
An interim safety review by [CONTACT_655826] 6 participant s with 3 
weeks of follow -up, 2 participant s with Grade 3/[ADDRESS_883144] participant  
enrolls . Subsequent SMC reviews are planned at approximately 6 month intervals , or in 
the event of 2 participant s with Grade ≥ 3 toxicities or 3 participant s discontinuing 
study treatment due to toxicities in the interim.   
 
In the event the SMC review is triggered due to toxicities (2 participant s with 
Grade ≥ 3 toxicities or 3 participant s discontinuing study treatment due to 
toxicities), accrual will be paused while the SMC review takes place. In addition, 
during the course of the study if any participant  develops PML,  or neurologic 
condition  or dies of a drug -related adverse event , or if more than 2 participants, 
randomized to  Arm A, experience confirmed virologic failure (see section 7.5 for 
definition) then dosing for all study participants will be stopped.  
 
The team has requested the SMC consider the grade of the events, the time to 
resolution (if any ), the temporal relatio nship to drug administration,  and the site 
clinician’s judgment of the relationship to treatment. The team would recommend 
particular review by [CONTACT_655827] [IP_ADDRESS].   
 
Complementing the S MC reviews, the team will also notify the SMC of all drug 
related SAEs, Grade 4 toxicities, as well as all drug -related Grade 3 toxicities.   In 
addition, the core team or the SMC may ask for the SMC, at any time, to 
independently review all available safet y data (unblinded to treatment arms) and 
make a recommendation to the End-Organ Disease and Inflammation 
Transformative Science Group on whether to modify or stop the study. The team 
will also monitor (monthly) all Grade ≥ 2 signs and symptoms, laboratory 
abnormalities, and diagnoses, as well as all primary events with summaries 
pooled over study arms.

FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/15 
 
As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_655773], our primary analysis of efficacy will be 
an as -treated analysis, limit ed to participant s who meet all of the following 
conditions: (a) have data at baseline and week 5, (b)  for the ruxolitinib arm, 
remain on study treatment through week 5 and miss no more than 6 doses 
cumulatively, (c)  did not change ART, use prohibited medi cations, or have a 
virologic failure during this time period.  
 
Changes from baseline t o week 5 in plasma IL -6 (on log 10 scale) will be 
summarized with the mean and a 90% confidence interval (CI) for the mean 
change in each treatment arm, and compared betw een arms with a t-test. The 
baseline value will be calculated as the geometric mean of pre -entry and entry, 
and the week 5 value as the geometric mean of weeks 4 and 5.  If missing one of 
the pre -entry or entry values, then the available measure will be use d as the 
baseline value, and similarly, if missing one of the week 4 or week 5 values, then 
the available measure will be used as the week 5 value.  
 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_655828] s in the 
ruxolitinib arm who experienc eing the primary safety outcome measure [IP_ADDRESS] . 
In addition, safety will be compared between the treatment arms via a one -
sided Fisher’s exact test at 5% alpha level , in terms of [IP_ADDRESS], but with this 
composite safety outcome modified to address the A5336  design where 
Arm B does not receive any study treatment . Specifically “discontinuation 
of ruxolitinib due to thrombocytopenia” will be modified to “occurrence of 
Grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia” and “any Grade 4 or recurrence of 
Grade 3 toxicity relate d to study drug” will be modified to “any Grade 4 or 
recurrence of Grade 3 toxicity.” Tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_655829].  
 
9.6.2  Secondary Analyses  
 
Participant -specific c hanges from baseline to week  5 in other measurements of 
immune activation and inflammation, and CD4+ T -cell counts  will be summarized 
similarly to the primary efficacy measure, via means and 90% CIs for the mean 
change for each of the study arms.  The log [ADDRESS_883145]. HIV-1 RNA will be summarized by [CONTACT_655830] s with confirmed HIV -1 RNA > 40 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and > 200 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] /mL. Due to an anticipate d high proportion of lower limit of detection 
censoring, levels of HHV shedding will be compared between arms at week 
[ADDRESS_883146] with 2 -sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_883147] 
rank. In the event of limited lower limit of detection censoring, repeated 
measure modeling will be used to explore longitudinal changes in HHV 
shedding.  
 
Safety events (signs and symptoms, laboratory values, diagnoses, and other 
SAEs) will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_655831]

each study arm. Comparisons of overall and toxicity -specific grades between 
study arm s will be shown descriptively.  
 
Longitudinal changes from baseline to week 12 in all measures will be examin ed 
via descriptive summaries and plots.   
 
Statistical significance will be tested using a two -sided alpha = 0.10 with no 
adjustment for multiple testing.  
 
 
10.0 PHARMACOLOGY PLAN  
 
10.1 Pharmacology Objectives  
 
10.1.1  Primary Objective  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To measure the PK of ruxolitinib in this population of participant s with 
well-controlled HIV -1, and to  characterize the relationship  between 
ruxolitinib post-hoc estimated exposures (e.g., steady -state AUC = 
dose/CL/F) and immunol ogical biomarkers of the study drug.  
 
10.1.2  Secondary Objectives  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  To compare ruxolitinib PK parameters in study participant s on specific 
ARV regimens to those reported for historical controls (no 
coadministered drugs) to assess the potential effect  of ARV 
administration on ruxolitin ib PK.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  To compare PK parameters of selected ARV medications  (NNRTI’s and 
INSTI’s) when co administered with ruxolitinib  to historical controls  (no 
coadministered drugs)  in order to explore possible effect s of rux olitinib 
on ARV concentrations.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] To evaluate the relationship between ruxolitinib concentrations in 
individual participant s with the time course of changes in biomarkers  
of immune response (hysteresis analysis).  
 
10.2 Pharmacology  Study Design  
 
Participant s randomized to  Arm A will undergo  blood sampling during two study visits 
as indicated in section 6.1 for asse ssment of the PK  of ruxolit inib and selected ARV  
drugs.  
 
Each PK visit req uires that the study participant  take their m orning dose of ruxolitinib as 
a timed observed do se administered in the clinic. During  each of  the two PK visits, four 
blood samples will be collected for PK analysis .  
 
 
 65 A5336  
FINAL  Version 2.0 
  05/21/15 
 
10.3 Primary and Secondary Data, Modeling, and Data Analysis  
 
The PK  of ruxolitinib following oral administration will be m odeled using population 
methods  with the NONMEM computer program (7.3  or later,  ICON Development 
Solutions, Leopardstown, Ireland ) [88], using the PLT Tools statistical interface ( 5.1 or 
later, PLT Soft, San Francisco, CA) . Resulting model parameters will be  compared t o a 
model recently reported for ruxolitinib  without co administered drugs  in patients with 
myelofibrosis  [89]. One and [ADDRESS_883148] -order absorption 
into the plasma compartment will be fitted as they were reported to adequately des cribe 
ruxolitinib PK in the myelofibrosis population PK study. Between -participant  variances 
(IIV, 2) of PK parameters ( ) will be modeled as log -normally distributed, and an 
appropriate residual error model (e.g. , proportional and/or additive ,) will be used. Also, 
since PK samplings are  planned on two different o ccasions, we will also explore inter -
occasional variations in model parameters (e.g. , oral systemic clearance ( CL/F) and 
distribution volume (V/ F, where F=bioavailability, assumed=1, no IV dose a dministered) ), 
using established methods  [90]. Only concent rations >  LOQ were included in the 
analysis. Criteria for model convergence will include convergence to > 3 decimal places 
using an appropriate convergence method (e.g. , First Order Conditional Est imation with 
- interactions . Model diagnostics of goodness of fit will include the minimum value the 
NONMEM objective function (OFV= -2 log -likelihood), and visual inspection of graphics , 
e.g., correlation/symmetry of observations versus predictions (pop ulation and post -hoc), 
condi tional weighted residual  versus time and predictions  [91-93].  
 
Based on the planned 12 hour dosing regimen and reported ruxolitinib  plasma 
concentrations over a 12 hour  dose interval, we anticipate that a  1-compartment model 
will adequate ly describe the PK  of ruxolitinib in this study. However, if the  fit of the model 
to the data is improved using a 2 -compartment model, based upon the dispersion of 
residuals about the  respective lines of identity of observed versus predicted pla sma 
concentrations (population and post -hoc), and by a decrease in OFV, then  the [ADDRESS_883149] the 
significance of body -weight as possible continuous covariate on V/F and CL/F and 
creatinine cl earance (calculated using the Cockroft -Gault formula) as a covariate of CL/F 
[94]. The ability of the final model to simulate without bias will be tested using a “visual 
predictive check” method, in which >  1,000 individuals are simulated using the samplin g 
scheme (to ensure reproducible predictions), and used to compute 5% - 95% percentile 
ranges of concentration versus time. Actual data will then be  superimposed to visually 
assess model bias  [95]. Post -hoc fitted parameters from participant s administered 
ruxolitinib alone or with EFV will be compared using ANCOVA.  A value <  0.05 will be 
considered statistically significant for all tests. A similar model  will be attempted for EFV  
and other ARV s provided enough  participant s taking  a particular ARV  are recrui ted. 
Alternatively, their PK will be compared informally with published PK studies [ 50, 51, 96, 
97].  
 
Concen trations of ARVs  (NNRTI s and INSTI s) obtained at the same time as ruxolitinib  
concentrations will be compared to historical controls in order to ex plore the possible 
effect of ruxolitinib  on ARV concentrations. This is considered an exploratory analysis 
only.

SHORT TITLE FOR THE STUDY: (A5336) Trial of Ruxolitinib in Antiretrovir al-Treated HIV -
Infected Adults ( FINAL  Version 2.0, Dated 05/21/15)  
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
When a person becomes infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), his/her immune system 
(the system that helps fight infection) is weakened (partly because the number o f CD4+ cells 
[the number of white blood cells that fight infection ] goes down). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_655777] (ART), latent reservoirs (infected cells that are not actively producing 
HIV) remain present in the blood and contribut e to ongoing immune system activation (immune 
system  becomes active  in response to an infection ) and  inflammation (reaction to an infection or 
irritation) in the body.  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you:  
 
 are infected with  HIV-1 
 have a very low viral load  (amount of virus in the blood)  
 have CD4+ T cell count  of more than 350 cells  
 are on stable ART for at least 3  months  
 
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_655836] (NIH) for  the AIDS Clinical Trials 
Group (A CTG). The doctor in charge of this study at this site is: ( insert name [CONTACT_63753] ). Before you decide if you want to be a part of this study, we want you to know 
about the study.  
 
This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you 
about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time.  If you agree 
to take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will get a copy to 
keep.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The purpose of this study is to find out more about the safety and tolerability  (how well your 
body accepts the study drug ) of the u se of ruxolitinib in persons  with HIV -1 infection who are 
also being treated with ART. We want to learn w hether ruxolitinib will decrease inflammation 
and immune activation  in the body; whether ruxolitinib will change the level of HIV -1 in your 
blood; and how ruxolitinib interacts with ART in the blood.

Ruxolitinib is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA)  to treat myelofibrosis, a 
disorder in which bone marrow is replaced by [CONTACT_655837] (fibrosis) tissue. Many of the cytokines 
(regulators of the body’s reaction to infection, immune response, and inflammation) affected by 
[CONTACT_655838]. Because ruxolitinib acts on these cytokines, it is 
proposed that it may also be a possible treatment for HIV  by [CONTACT_389077]. 
Inflammation has been associated with organ disease in people living with HIV.  
 
 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IF I A M IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be asked to sign this consent form and 
schedule  a screening visit to determine if you can join the study . If so, you will be randomly 
assigned (as if by [CONTACT_655839] a coin) to either one of the two groups, Group A or Group B 
(see below) . The screening visit will take about 1.5 hours.   
 
Screening visit  
 Your HIV -[ADDRESS_883182].  
 You will have a physical exam and will be asked about your health and medicines you have 
taken in the past or are taking now.  
 You will have about [ADDRESS_883183] results when they are available.  
 If you are a woman able to become pregnant, you will be asked to give a urine or blood 
sample to see if you are pregnant. You will not be able to enroll in this study i f you are 
pregnant. You will be told the result of the test when it becomes available.   
 
If you do not enroll into the study  
If you decide not to take part in this study or if you do not meet the eligibility requirements, we 
will still use some of your in formation. As part of this screeni ng visit, some demographic (for 
example , age, sex, race), clin ical (for example , disease condition, diagnosis), and laboratory (for 
example , CD4+ T  cell count, viral load) information is being collected from you so that AC TG 
researchers may help determine whether there are patterns or common reasons why people do 
not join a study.  
 
Pre-Entry  
If you qualify for the study, you will come to the clinic at least one day after the screening visit 
for the pre -entry visit. Please n ote it is possible that the pre -entry and screening visits may be 
combined. If not, at the pre -entry visit you will have a complete physical exam. You will also 
have blood drawn for CD4+ T cell count and for samples to be stored for future HIV -related 
testing for this study. A total of 2 tablespoon  of blood will be drawn at this visit. Saliva and cells 
from your cheeks will be collected with an oral swab and tested for the presence of 
human herpes  viruses  (HHV; a virus causing sores most often found around the mouth 
or the genitals) . The visit will last about [ADDRESS_883184] about 60-90 minutes.  
   A5336 ( 05/21/15) 
FINAL  Version 2.0 
 APPENDIX I (Cont'd)  Page 3 of 10 
 
During this visit:  
 You will have a physical exam performed. You will be asked about medical history and any 
medicines you have taken since the last visit.   
 If you are  a woman able to get pregnant, you will be asked to provide blood or urine for a 
pregnancy test. You cannot start treatment if you are pregnant. You will be given the results 
of your pregnancy test as soon as it becomes available.  
 You will have 7 tablespoo ns of blood drawn for routine safety blood tests  including lipid 
testing , CD4+ T cell count, viral loa d, immune tests  along with other tests. In addition, some 
of your blood will  be stored for future testing required by [CONTACT_1758].  
 Saliva and cells from you r cheeks will be collected with an oral swab and tested for 
the presence of HHV . 
 You will be asked ques tions about adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) medicines.  
 If you are in Group A, y ou will be given a medication diary to record the d ate and time of 
ruxolitinib, and ARV  medicines for the 3 days preceding the week 1 study visit.  The 
medication diary will be collected at the week 1 study visit.  
 
Once all these tests are done, you will be randomly assigned to either one of the two groups 
(Group A or Group B) . However, because of the way the study is designed, there will be a 
greater chance of your being in Group A.  
 
 Group A: Takes ruxolitinib by [CONTACT_1966] t wice a day for the next 5 weeks . 
 Group B:  No study treatment .   
 
If you are randomized to Group A, at this visit study staff will give you enough study drug  to last 
until the next study visit. You will be asked not to drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit while 
taking the study drug. At the week [ADDRESS_883185] return any remaining study drug.   
 
On Study Visits a fter Entry  
Regardless of which group you are assigned to, y ou will come to the clinic  one week  after your 
initial entry v isit (week 1) and then study weeks 2, 4, [ADDRESS_883186], which means that for eigh t hours before your vis it, you cannot eat or drink anything except 
water and your medication. Your next visit w ill not be until week 10 on study  and your f inal visit 
will be at week 12 . Visits will take about 30 -60 minutes  except weeks 1 and 4 study visits  if you 
are in Group A (see 5th bullet below) . If you are in Group A, a t the week [ADDRESS_883187] the date and time of ruxol itinib, and ARV  medicines for the 3 
days preceding  the week 4 study visit.  The medicati on diary will be collected at the week 4 
study visit.   
 
During these visits:  
 You will have a brief physical exam performed.  
 You will be asked about any new medications since your last visit including your HIV -1 
medications.  
 You will have 1 tablespoon  of blood drawn for rou tine safety blood tests, including lipid 
testing at week 5, and immune tests. At weeks 2, 5, and 12 study visits, blood will be drawn 
for CD4+ T cells c ount and viral load tests.  
 You will have approximately from 2 to 6  tablespoons of blo od drawn and stored for future 
protocol -related testing  (except at the week 1 v isit).     
   A5336 ( 05/21/15) 
FINAL  Version 2.0 
 APPENDIX I (Cont'd)  Page 4 of 10 
 
 Saliva and cells from your cheeks will be collected with an oral swab and tested for 
the presence of HHV . 
 If you are in Group A, a t week s [ADDRESS_883188] about 2 tablespoons of 
blood drawn over 6-8 hours  to measure  ruxolitinib and ARV medicines levels in your blood.  
You will be contact[CONTACT_655840] (PK) visit to remind you not to 
take your morning dose of ruxolitinib or ARV medicines (including efaviren z) until instructed 
during your clinic visit in the morning. You will be asked to bring your study drug and ARV 
medicines  to the clinic.  You will have blood drawn 4 times during this time period to 
determine the levels  of ruxolitinib and  ARV medicine s in your blood. For the multiple blood 
samples required, an indwelling catheter (a small, thin tube) will be put into an arm vein and 
left in place during your stay in the clinic  if preferred . An IV tube will be placed at the end o f 
the catheter for the PK blood draws.  This will allow the blood samples to be drawn without 
any additional needle sticks.  You may eat or drink as you wish during this period.  
 You will be asked questions about adherence to the study drug (Group A) and your ARV 
medicines . 
 
Virologic Failure  
If the study staff sees that your viral load has gone up, and there is no other known explanation 
such as the flu, you will be asked to have another test done within 7 days . If your viral load is 
still up and you are stil l taking study drug, you will be asked to stop the study drug  and come to 
the clinic within 2 weeks. You will be followed on study/off study treatment until the final study 
visit, week 12.  
 
Pregnancy  
If you become pregnant, study drug will be discontinued immediately , and you will be 
encouraged to remain in the study to be followed on study/off treatment until study completion . 
You will be followed by [CONTACT_655841] . 
 
Premature Treatment/Study Discontinuation  
If you stop taking the study drug before the study -defined 5 -week treatment period, you will be 
asked to return to the clinic to complete some evaluations.  
 You will have a brief physical examination performed.  
 You will be asked about any new medications s ince your last visit including your HIV -1 
medications.  
 You will have approximately 6 tablespoons of blood drawn for routine safety blood tests  
including lipid panel , CD4+ T cells count, viral lo ad, immune tests  along with other tests. 
Also, some of your bl ood will be stored for future protocol -related testing.  
 Saliva and cells from your cheeks will be collected with an oral swab and tested for 
the presence of HHV . 
 If you are in Group A, y ou will have 2 tablespoons of blood drawn for measuring ruxolitinib 
and HIV -1 drug levels in your blood  if you are discontinuing study treatment  prior to week 4 . 
 You will be ask ed questions about adherence  to the study drug (Group A) and your ARV 
medicines .  
 
Other  
If you agree, some of your blood  that is left over after all  required study testing is done may be 
stored (with usual protectors of identity) and used for ACTG -approved HIV -1 related research.

 Transaminase elevations  (increased liver enzymes that may indicate liver disease )  
 Cholesterol elevation  
 Infections  
  
It is not known whether the study drug passes through breast milk and whether it can produce 
adverse e ffects in the infant. Additionally, it is not known whether taking the study drug will 
reduce the risk of passing HIV to the baby [CONTACT_655842]. You must tell the study doctor or 
nurse whether you are breastfeeding before enrolling in the study. You cannot participate in 
the study if you are breastfeeding.  
 
There is a risk of serious and/or life -threatening side effects when non -study medications are 
taken with the study drug. For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse about all 
medicat ions you are taking before you start the study and also before starting any new 
medications while on the study. Also, you must tell the study doctor or nurse before enrolling in 
any other clinical trials while on this study.  
 
Risk of Blood Draw  
 
Taking blo od may cause some discomfort, bleeding, bruising, and/or swelling where the needle 
enters the body and in rare ca ses it may result in fainting. There is a small risk of infection.

ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANCY?  
 
It is not known if the drug or drug combinations in this study harm unborn babies. If you are 
having sex that could lead to pregnancy, you must agree not to become pregnant  or make a 
woman pregnant.  
 
Because of the risk involved, you and your partner must use one form  of birth control that you 
discuss with the study staff. You must start one method of birth control when you are taking your 
study drug. You must con tinue to use this method until 7  weeks after you stop the study drug.

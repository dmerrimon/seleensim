Protocol GO28141, Version 8 3PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 8: 
RATIONALE 
Protocol GO28141 has been amended primarily to update the safety information for the 
identified risks of rhabdomyolysis and CPK elevations and hemorrhage associated with cobimetinib.  
Specific changes to the protocol are as follows: 
• Language around cobimetinib approval has been clarified (Section 5.1). 
• Safety language for rhabdomyolysis/CPK elevations and hemorrhage has been 
updated and moved to “identified risks associated with cobimetinib” (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
• Language around impaired fertility and developmental toxicity was clarified (Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]). 
• The term “non-serious adverse events of special interest” has been updated to 
“adverse events of special interest” to reflect standard [COMPANY_002] terminology 
(Sections [IP_ADDRESS], 5.2, 5.2.3, [IP_ADDRESS], 5.4, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, and 5.7). 
• The dose modification table has been updated (Table 10 in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

patient-reported outcome data (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• The term “spontaneous abortion” has been changed to “abortion” to reflect standard 
[COMPANY_002] terminology (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
• The term “adverse event of concern” has  been changed to “adverse event of special 
interest” for clarity (Section 5.6). 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
GLOBAL CHANGES 
The term “non-serious adverse event of special interest” and the term “adverse event of 
concern” have been changed to “adverse event of special interest.” 
SECTION 5.1:  Safety Plan 
Cobimetinib ( for use with vemurafenib)  is approved in the [LOCATION_002] , Canada,  and 
members of the European Union , as well as and other countries.   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Important  Identified Risks Associ ated with Cobimetinib 
Hemorrhage 
Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with cobimeti nib.  In clinical studies with cobimetinib, 
events of cerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, reproductive tract hemorrhage, and hematuria, have been reported. 
In the Phase III study GO28141, Grade 1
−4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 13.0% 
of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and in 7.3% of patients treated 
with placebo plus vemurafenib.  The majority of hemorrhagic events were Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious.  Grade 3
−4 hemorrhage events were reported in 1.2% of patients who 
received cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and 0.8% of patients who received placebo plus vemurafenib. 
Caution should be used in patients with additional risk factors for bleeding, such as 
brain metastases, and/or in patients who us e concomitant medications that increase the 
risk of bleeding (including anti-platelet or anticoagulant therapy).  
Instructions and dose modifications for hemorrhage events are included in Table 10, in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Rhabdomyolysis and CPK Elevations 
Elevations in CPK have been observed in patients who received cobimetinib monotherapy as well as when administered with other agents.  The majority of CPK elevations reported were asymptomatic, non-serious, and resolved with or without study drug interruption.  One event of rhabdomyolysis was reported in the Phase III study GO28141 (cobimetinib pl us vemurafenib), and rhabdomyolysis has been reported 
in post-marketing experience.  
In Study GO28141, elevated CPK was reported as an adverse event more frequently in 
patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (32.4% all grades, 11.3% Grade
 ≥ 3 
events) than placebo plus vemurafenib (8.1% all grades, 0% Grade  ≥ 3 events).   
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 5 CPK will be monitored at baseline and mont hly during treatment or as clinically 
indicated.  Instructions for dose modificatio ns for elevated CPK and rhabdomyolysis are 
included in Table 10 in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Potential Ri sks Associated with Cobimetinib 
Increased CPK or Rhabdomyolysis  
Elevations in CPK have been observed in patients who received cobimetinib 
monotherapy as well as when combined with other agents.  In the Phase  III study 
GO28141, CPK was evaluated at baseline and at regu lar intervals.  The majority of CPK 
elevations reported were asymptomatic, non serious, and resolved with or without study 
drug interruption.  While almost all elevations in CPK were asymptomatic laboratory 
findings, a clinical diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was reported for 1  patient in each 
treatment arm in Study  GO28141.  In the patient who received cobimetinib and 
vemurafenib, CPK levels were  > 10  × ULN (Grade  4).  Thus, Grade  4 elevations in CPK 
levels may be associated with rhabdomyolysis, which has also  been observed with other 
MEK inhibitors.  
In the Phase III study, elevated CPK was r eported as an adverse event more frequently 
in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (29.9% all grades, 12% Grade  ≥ 3 
events) than placebo plus vemurafenib (3. 3% all grades, 0.4% Grade  ≥ 3 events).  
No patients experienced Grade 5 events.  Serious adverse events were reported in 
2 patients (0.8%) treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib; in both cases the 
cobimetinib dose was reduced and the events resolved.  I n the Phase I single agent 
study (MEK4592g), 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 increase in CPK.  
Impaired Female Fertility and Developmental Toxicity  
Title change only.  
Teratogenicity and Development Toxicity  
In a dedicated nonclinical embryo-fetal toxici ty study, cobimetinib produced fetal toxicity 
(resorptions and reductions in fetal weight), and teratogenicity (malformations of the 
great vessels and skull) at similar systemic  exposures in rat to those observed in 
patients administered the 60 mg dose. 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]:  Other Risks Associated with Cobimetinib 
Hemorrhage  
Hemorrhage events, including cerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, 
reproductive tract hemorrhage, and hematuria, have been reported in clinical studies of 
cobimetinib.  
In the Phase III study GO28141, hemorrhagic  events were reported in 9.8% of patients 
treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, and in 5.9% of patients treated with placebo 
plus vemurafenib.  Events that were reported at frequencies  > 1% higher in patients 
treate d with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib were 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 6 hematuria (2.0% vs. 0.8%, respectively) and cerebral hemorrhage (1.2% vs. 0%, 
respectively).  The  majority of hemorrhagic events were Grade 1 or 2 and non serious.  
Grade 3−4 hemorrhage  events were reported in 1.2% of patients who received 
cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and 0.8% of patients who received placebo plus 
vemurafenib.  
Hypersensitivity  
Please refer to the cobimetinib IB for additional safety information.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Management of Sp ecific Toxicities and Dose Modification 
Guidelines 
Table 10:  Management of Specifi c Toxicities and Dose Modification 
Guidelines  
The table has been updated to reflect the latest safety guidance. 
SECTION 5.2.3:  Non Serious  Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below 
Any organism, virus, or infectious part icle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
 
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Adverse Events Associated with an Overdose or Error in 
Drug Administration Overdoses  
Title change only. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Patient-Reported Outcome Data 
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data , and safety analyses will not be 
performed using PRO data .   
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Abortions 
Any spontaneous abortion associated with a pregnancy occurring during the study or 
within [ADDRESS_1172162] dose of study drug should be classified as a serious adverse 
event (as the Sponsor considers spontaneous abortions to be medically significant 
events), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).

Study Design  
Description of Study 
Study GO28141 is a multicenter, ra ndomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib  with 
vemurafenib alone, in previously untreated BRAFV600 mutation−positive patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma.  
Approximately 500 previously untreated BRAFV600 mutation-positive patients with unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic melanoma will be ra ndomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment 
with one of the following regimens: 
• Arm A (control arm) :  vemurafenib 960 mg by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) twice daily (BID) on Days 1 −28 
and placebo by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) once daily (QD) on Days 1 −21 of each 28-day treatment cycle 
• Arm B (investigational arm) :  vemurafenib 960 mg PO BID on Days 1 −28 and cobimetinib  
60 mg PO QD on Days 1 −21 of each 28-day treatment cycle 
 
The stratified, permuted-bloc k randomization scheme will be used for treatment allocation 
based on the following stratification factors: 
• Geographic region (North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand/others) 
• Metastatic classification (unresectable Stage IIIc, M1a, and M1b; or M1c) 
 
After signing informed consent, patients will under go screening procedures that include testing 
for the BRAFV600 mutation; laboratory tests (hematology, chemistries, liver function tests); 
12-lead ECG; left-ventricular function evaluati on (echocardiogram or multigated acquisition 
[MUGA] scan), contrast-enhanced brain comp uted tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI); contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and 
ophthalmologic and dermatologic assessments.  
All eligible patients will be randomized to treatment in either Arm A (vemurafenib and placebo) 
or Arm B (vemurafenib and cobi metinib).  Vemurafenib will be taken starting on Day 1 to Day 28 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172180] dose of  vemurafenib should be taken in the morning, 
and the second dose should be taken in the evening.  The cobimetinib  or placebo tablet will be 
taken once daily starting on Day 1 to Day 21 of each 28-day treatment cycle.  The cobimetinib 
or placebo tablet should be taken at approxim ately the same time each day, preferably in the 
morning with the vemurafenib dose.  Vemurafenib and cobimetinib/placebo can be taken with or 
without a meal, and should be taken with a glass of water.  
All patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability during all cycles of therapy, at the 
end-of-study treatment visit, and during the fo llow-up period.  Patients will be assessed for 
adverse events every [ADDRESS_1172181] 2 cycles, then prior to each subsequent cycle, 
and as necessary throughout the study.  Tumor response will be evaluated according to Re sponse Evaluation Criter ia in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1.  Any evaluable and measurable disease must be documented at 
screening and re-assessed at each subsequent tu mor evaluation.  Response will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_63376] 8-week intervals.  At the investigator’s discretion, CT/MRI scans may be 
repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected.  The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 will be used to 
characterize the toxicity profile of the study  treatments on all patients.  ECG monitoring for 
patients who receive vemurafenib will be conducted in accordance with the vemurafenib IB.  
Ongoing ECG monitoring is no longer required for patients who continue to receive only 
cobimetinib/placebo unless clinically indicated.   Dermatologic assessm ent will be performed at 
the beginning of Cycle 2 ( ±
 1 week) and per local standard of care thereafter.  Ophthalmologic 
examinations and left ventricular function eval uation (echocardiogram or MUGA) are evaluated 
throughout the study. 
Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of 
consent, whichever occurs  earliest.  Patients on the vemurafenib and placebo treatment arm will 
be eligible to cross over to the vemurafenib and cobimetinib treatment arm prior to disease 
progression so long as the patient has not discontinued vemurafenib treatment should the 
investigator feel that the addition of cobimetinib may benefit the patient and the patient provides informed consent and continues to be followed for survival.  Patients who have previously 
discontinued vemurafenib and who are receivin g only placebo may not cross over and should 
discontinue all study treatment.

discontinuation will still need to be fo llowed for survival and SCC.   
Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome measure for this study is as follows: 
• PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, 
as determined by [CONTACT_436677] v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever 
comes first.   
 
The secondary outcome measures are as follows: 
• Overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause   
• Objective response rate for patients with  measurable disease at baseline, defined as 
complete or partial response as assessed by [CONTACT_843580] v1.1 
• Duration of response for patients with measurable disease at baseline, defined as the time

Exploratory exposure-response analyses for effica cy and safety endpoints, including QTc, will 
be performed. 
Patient-Reported Outcome Measures  
The PRO measures for this  study are as follows: 
• EORTC QLQ-C30 
• EuroQol’s EQ-5D Questionnaire  
 
Exploratory Outcome Measures  
The exploratory biomarker analyses in tumor tissue may investigate potential intrinsic and 
acquired resistance mechanisms to MEK and BRAF inhibition.  Pre-treatment tumor tissue 
(i.e., archived material or biopsies collected during screening, prior to initiation of study 
treatment) and tumor biopsies during treatment  (Cycle 2 Day 15) and at the end of study 
treatment (at the time of PD) will be required. 
In order to investigate if chromosomal and molecular genetic aberrations are linked to 
therapeutic outcome and development of severe  adverse events in patients treated with 
vemurafenib and cobimetinib, DNA may be isolated from a single whole blood collected at 
baseline as well as tumor tissues. 
Additional efficacy exploratory analyses will incl ude PFS rates and OS rates at fixed timepoints 
(e.g., 3, 6, 9, 12 months, etc.). 
Investigational Medicinal Products  
Test Product 
Double-blind study drug will be administered in 28-day cycles. 
Cobimetinib or placebo should be taken once da ily at approximately the same time each day 
with the morning vemurafenib dose, and no later than [ADDRESS_1172191] 7 days off cobimetinib is required pr ior to starting a new treatment cycle.   
Vemurafenib will be taken orally, at a starting dose of 960 mg (4 tablets) BID.  The first dose of 
vemurafenib should be taken in the morning, and the second dose should be taken in the 
evening, at least [ADDRESS_1172192] dose (the ideal interval between doses is 12 hours).  
Vemurafenib can be taken with or without a meal, and should be taken with a glass of water.  
The vemurafenib tablets should never be chewed, cut, or crushed. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172193] at an overall 0.05 significance level (2-sided).   
The statistical hypothesis of this study is as follows: 
H0: PFS (Arm A) = PFS (Arm B)  
H1: PFS (Arm A)  ≠ PFS (Arm B)  
where PFS (Arm A)  represents the survival function of PFS in the vemurafenib  + placebo  arm and 
PFS (Arm B)  represents the survival function of PFS in the vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm. 
PFS as assessed by [CONTACT_843583].  PFS is defined as the 
time between date of randomization and the dat e of first documented disease progression or 
death, whichever occurs first.  Disease progression will be determined based on investigator 
assessment using RECIST v1.1.  Data from patients who have not experienced disease 
progression or death will be censored at the last  tumor assessment date.  Data from patients 
with no post-baseline tumor assessment w ill be censored at the randomization date.  
The hazard ratio for PFS will be estimated using a stratified Cox model.  Two-sided 95% CIs for the hazard ratio will be provided.  The stratified analyses will incorporate 2 stratification factors:  
geographic region (North America, Europe, Au stralia/New Zealand/others) and metastatic 
classification (unresectable Stage IIIc, M1a, and M1b; M1c).  Results from an unstratified 
log-rank test and the unstratified hazard ratio will also be presented.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm, and the 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be provided.   
Determination of Sample Size   
Progression-free survival:  
 
The type 1 error ( α) for the analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS is 0.05 (2-sided).   
Approximately [ADDRESS_1172194] occurred.  Statistical 
considerations are based on the following assumptions: 
• Stratified log-rank test at 0.05 significance level (2-sided) 
• 6 months median PFS for the vemurafenib  + placebo arm 
• 11 months median PFS for the vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm 
• Accrual ramp-up time of 9 months to reac h 65 patients per month thereafter for a total 
enrollment period of approximate 14 months 
• 5% dropout rate 
• No interim analysis of PFS 
 
A total of 206 PFS events provides > 95% power to detect an improvement in median PFS from 
6 months in the vemurafenib  + placebo arm to 11 months in the vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm 
(corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.55, and the minimal detectable difference is 0.76).   
Overall survival:  
The type 1 error ( α) for the analysis of the secondary endpoint of OS is 0.05 (2-sided).   
The final analysis of OS will be performed afte r the occurrence of approximately 250 deaths.  
A total of 250 deaths provides approximately 80%  power to detect an improvement in median 
OS from 15 months in the vemurafenib  + placebo arm to 21.4 months in the 
vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm (corresponding to a hazard ratio for death of 0.70) at an overall 
2-sided 0.05 significance level.

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 26 Interim Analyses   
Interim efficacy analysis of primary endpoint:   
No interim analyses of the primary endpoint (PFS) will be performed. 
Analysis of overall survival:   
The OS analyses plan for this study protocol (v 5) and the statistical analysis plan (SAP) have 
been revised.  The study will incorporate 2 OS analyses (1 interim and 1 final analysis).  The 
first OS interim analysis was performed at the time of the primary PFS anal ysis ([ADDRESS_1172195] patient was randomized).  The origina lly planned final analysis for OS at 385 events is 
anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2017.  The rapid development of other potentially 
effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_843525], which may potentially confound the OS benefit of 
vemurafenib  + cobimetinib in future OS analyses. Therefore, in order to minimize this potential 
impact while maintaining a statistically robust evaluation of the OS benef it associated with the 
combination, the protocol-defined OS analyses have been revised. 
The revised plan for OS analyses is to perf orm the final OS analysis at approximately 
250 deaths without further interim analyses.  The type 1 error rate would be strictly controlled at 
the 0.05 level by [CONTACT_843584]-DeMets implement ation of the O’Brien-Fleming 
use function as pre-specified in the original protocol and SAP.  
The final OS analysis will be performed after the occurrence of approximately 250 deaths 
(projected to occur at approximately [ADDRESS_1172196] patient was randomized).  
The Lan-DeMets implementation of the O’Brien and Fleming use function will be used to control 
the overall type I error for the OS comparison  at a 2-sided, 0.05 significance level.

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 31 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON MELANOMA 
1.1.1 Melanoma  
Approximately 160,000 new cases of me lanoma are diagnosed globally each year 
(Ries et al. 2003 ).  According to a World Health Organization report, about 
48,000 melanoma-related deaths occur worldwide every year ( Lucas 200
6).  The highest 
incidence ra tes of melanoma occur in Australia a
nd New Zealand, where the annual 
incidence is more than double the highest rates recorded in Europe.  In Australia, 
melanoma is the fourth most common cancer among males and the third most common cancer among females.  Currently, the lif etime risk for developm ent of melanoma in 
Australia is 1 in 14 for men and 1 in 24 for women ( SUNSMART 2007 , Australian 
Department of Health and Ageing 2008 ).  Accord ing to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI), it is estimated that more than 76,000 new melanoma c
ases will be diagnosed and 
more than 9000 patients will die from the disease in the [LOCATION_002] during 2012 (NCI 2012).  Further, incidence rates for melanoma have increased sharply by 
[CONTACT_569070] l 
y 6% per year in the [LOCATION_002] since the 1970s.  There are only a 
limited number of treatments available for metastatic melanoma. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_1172201] been identified in 50% −
 68% of metastatic 
melanomas, specifically melanomas that arise from intermittent sun-exposed skin 
(e.g., superficial spreading and nodular melanomas) ( Maldonado et al. 2003 ; 
Beeram et al. 2005 ; Curtin et al. 2005 ; Lang and Mackie 2005 ).  BRAF mutations are 
uncommon in acral, mucosal, and uveal melanomas.  At the same time, BRAF mutations 
are common
 in benign nevi, suggesting that BRAF mutations are an early event in 
melanoma oncogenesis.  
About 90% of the BRAF mutations seen in metastatic melanoma occur in codon V600 
and more than 90% of the V600 mutations are V600E ( Sanger Institute 2012 ).  
Other uncommon varia nts, such a
s V600K, V600R, and V600D (in order of decreasing 
frequency), have also been identified, primarily in melanoma.  Nonclinical data indicate 
that these variant mutations, like V600, result in constitutive activation of the BRAF kinase.  
Most of the transforming activity of the BRAF
V600 is thought to result through the 
constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway 
(Gray-Schopfer et al. 2007).  The therapeutic relevance of BRAF is supp orted by [CONTACT_843586] ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 32 RNA leads to growth inhibition of melanoma cell lines in vitro ( Hingorani et al. 2003 ; 
Sumimoto et al. 2004).  This has led  to the development of agents that can inhibit B RAF 
kinase and tests to identify mutations ( Smalley et al. 2007 ; Ascierto et al. 2010 ; 
Flaherty et al. 2010 ).  The cobas® [ADDRESS_1172202] been used to identify BRAFV600 mutation status in clinical 
trials. 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON BRAF I NHIBITOR, VEMURAFENIB 
Vemurafenib (RO5185426 or PLX4032) is a low-molecular-weight, orally available 
inhibitor of the V600-mutant BRAF kinase.  Vemurafenib is currently approved as a treatment for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF
V600 mutation-positive 
melanoma who have been diagnosed with the cobas® [ADDRESS_1172203] in 
a number of countries worldwide, including the [LOCATION_002], Brazil, Mexico, the European Union, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel. 
1.2.1 Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Vemurafenib  
Based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) reported at the 1120mg twice daily (BID) dose level, the 960 mg BID dose was considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for vemurafenib.  This dose was selected for use in all subsequent clinical trials, including the Phase II (NP22657) and Phase III (NO25026) studies in patients with unresectable Stage IIIc or metastatic melanoma. 
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis used pooled data from 458 patients to 
estimate the median of the steady-state maximum concentration (C
max), minimum 
concentration (C min), and area under the plasma concentration  − time curve (AUC) from 
0 to 12 hours (AUC 0-12 h).  The C max, Cmin, and AUC 0-12 h were estimated to be 62 μg/mL, 
59 μg/mL, and 734 μg/mL  • h, respectively.  The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib are 
dose proportional between 240 mg BID and 960 mg BID.  Population PK analysis also confirmed that the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib are linear. 
Vemurafenib is absorbed with a median ti me to maximum plasma concentration (t
max) of 
approximately 4 hours.  Vemurafenib exhibits marked accumulation after repeat dosing 
at 960 mg BID with high interpatient variability.  The median accumulation ratio estimate for a BID regimen of vemurafenib is 7.36.  In the Phase II study, mean vemurafenib plasma concentrations at 4 hours after dose increased from 3.6 μg/mL on Day 1 to 
49.0 μ g/mL on Day 15 (range: 5.4 −118 μ g/mL). 
At steady state, the mean vemurafenib exposure in plasma is stable (concentrations before and 2− 4 hours after the morning dose) as indicated by [CONTACT_267526] 1.13.  
Similar marked, interpatient variability in plasma exposure was observed at steady state, independent of dose reduction. 
Following oral dosing, the absorption rate constant for the population of metastatic 
melanoma patients is estimated to be 0.19 h
-1 (with 101% between-patient variability).  
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 33 The apparent volume of distribution for vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma patients 
based on population PK analysis is estimated to be 91 L (with 64.8% between-patient variability).  Vemurafenib is highly bound to human plasma proteins in vitro ( >
 99%).  
On average, 95% of the dose was recovered within 18 days, the majority (94%) in feces, with
 < 1% recovered in urine.  The parent compound was the predominant component 
(95%) in plasma. 
Additional information can be obtained from the vemurafenib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
1.2.2 Efficacy of Vemurafenib in Patients with BRAFV600 
Mutation-Positive Metastatic Melanoma  
Phase I, PLX06-02 Study  
Among 32 evaluable patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic melanoma who 
enrolled in the extension cohort of the Phase I, PLX06-[ADDRESS_1172204] overall response rate (BORR) following vemurafenib treatment was 56.3%:  3 patients (9.4%) achieved a complete response (CR), and 15 patients (46.9%) had a partial response (PR).  Ten patients (31.3%) had stable disease (SD), and the remaining 4 patients had progressive disease (PD).  The median duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 7.6 months and 7.8 months, respectively; the 
1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 57% ( Flaherty et al. 2010 ). 
Phase II, NP22657 (BRIM 2)
 
Results of the Phase II, open-label, single-arm study (NP22657) of vemurafenib in [ADDRESS_1172205]-line treatment showed a confirmed BORR of 53% on the basis of Independent Review Committee assessments.  The median DOR and PFS were 6.7 months and 6.8 months, respectively (Sosman et al. 2012). 
Phase III, NO25026 (BRIM 3)
 
Study NO25026 is a Phase III open-label, mult icenter, randomized study of vemurafenib 
in previously untreated patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma.  Patients were randomized to treatment with vemurafenib 
(960 mg BID) or dacarbazine (DTIC; 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). 
A total of 675 patients were randomized to vemurafenib (n  = 337) or DTIC (n  = 338).  
Randomization was stratified according to disease stage, LDH, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, and geographic region.  Baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups.  Of patients randomized 
to vemurafenib, most were male (59%) and white (99%); median age was 56 years (28% were ≥
 65 years), all patients had ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1, and the 
majority of patients had Stage M1c disease.  The co-primary efficacy endpoints of the study were OS and PFS. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172206] (DSMB) 
recommended a release of the study results be cause of the compelling efficacy findings.  
Statistically significant and clinically m eaningful improvements were observed in the 
co-primary endpoints of OS (p  < 0.0001) and PFS (p  < 0.0001) (unstratified log-rank test).   
The most recent statistical analyses used a clinical cutoff of 1 February 2012 (Chapman et al. 2011).  After a median of 12.5 months of follow-up in the vemurafeni b 
arm, the Ka
plan -Meier estimate of median survival for patients randomized to 
vemurafenib was 13.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]:  12.0 −15.2 months).  
For patients randomized to DTIC, after a median of 8.4 months of follow-up, the Kaplan
-Meier estimate of median survival was 9.7 months (95% CI:  7.9 −12.8 months). 
The hazard ratio for death was 0.70 (95% CI:  0.57 −0.87) in favor of vemurafenib.  
Treatment with vemurafenib resulted in clinic ally meaningful and statistically significant 
improvements in PFS compared with DTIC treatment (hazard ratio 0.38 [95% CI: 0.32− 0.46, p
 < 0.001]).  There was a statistically significant improvement in 
BORR (confirmed) with vemurafenib (57.0%) compared with DTIC (8.6%), as assessed by [CONTACT_093]. 
1.2.3 Safety of Vemurafenib  
Vemurafenib clinical safety information for the treatment of patients with BRAFV600 
mutation–positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma has been derived mainly from the following studies: 
• PLX06-02, Phase I: clinical cutoff:  3 June 2010.  
– Dose Escalation Phase: (patients with solid tumors); original formulation, n
 = 26; 
micro-precipi[INVESTIGATOR_267471] (MBP) formulation, n  = 30  
– Treatment Extension Phase: metastatic melanoma patients, n  = 32  
– Treatment Extension Phase:  metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, 
n = 21. 
• NP22657 (BRIM2), Phase II: clinical cutoff:  31 January, 2011; n  = 132, update:  
1 February 2012 
• NO25026 (BRIM3), Phase III: clinical cutoff :  31 March 2011; vemurafenib n  = 337; 
dacarbazine (DTIC ) n = 338. Update: 1 February 2012 
• NP25163 Phase I clinical pharmacology study:   clinical cutoff:  1 March 2011;  
updated clinical cutoff:  30 May 2013; n  = 52.  
• MO25515, post− approval safety study:  interim analysis:  February 2012, n  = 2398.  
 
In addition, the pharmacokinetics of the MBP formulation have been evaluated in 
Phase I clinical pharmacology studies, including a CYP450 metabolism study (NP22676; n
 = 25), a study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the 240-mg MBP 
film-coated tablets (NP25163; n =  50), a mass balance study (NP25158; n  = 7), and a 
food-effect study (NP25396; n = 40). Please refer to the vemurafenib IB for more 
detailed information . 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 35 [IP_ADDRESS] Dose-Limiting Toxic ities of Vemurafenib 
The Phase I study PLX06-[ADDRESS_1172207] dose level tested, 1120 mg BID, 4 of 6 patients developed protocol-defined, non −life-threatening DLTs (including Grade 3 rash with pruritus, fatigue, 
and arthralgia) that resolved with temporary drug interruption.  All 4 patients were rechallenged at a lower dose and continued on treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety in  Phase II Study NP22657 (BRIM-2) 
Study NP22657 (BRIM-2), was an open-label, multicenter, Phase II trial of 132 previously treated patients who received vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma.  All 132 (100%) patients had at least one adverse event.  Treatment-related adverse events  occurred in 130 (98%) patients.  The majority of adverse events  were mild or 
moderate in intensity.  The most commonly reported adverse events  (occurring in
 
≥ 30% of patients) were arthralgia (68%), fatigue (57%), rash (54%), photosensitivity 
reaction (52%), nausea (42%), alopecia (38%), pruritus (32%), diarrhea (32%), skin papi[INVESTIGATOR_81875] (31%), and hyperkeratosis (30%). 
Seventy-three percent of patients in Study NP22657 (BRIM-2) had at least [ADDRESS_1172208] commonly reported treatment-related
 Grade 
3 or higher adverse events (incidence ≥ 5%) were:  squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of 
skin (23%), serum γ glutamyltransferase  (GGT) increase (9%), basal cell carcinoma (BCC; 
7%), rash (7%), maculo-papular rash (6%), and arthralgia (6%). 
Study NP22657 (BRIM-2) incorporated a QT/QT interval corrected (QTc) analysis with 
triplicate digital 12-lead ECGs obtained at 10 study visits throughout the study (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Safety in Phase III Trial: NO25026 (BRIM-3) 
Ninety-nine percent of patients in the vemurafenib group and 91% of patients in the DTIC group experienced at least [ADDRESS_1172209] commonly reported adverse events (occurring in ≥
 30% of patients) in the vemurafenib group were in the skin-related adverse events 
body system (vemurafenib 93% vs. DTIC 23%); the most common skin-related adverse events were alopecia, rash, and photosensitivity.  
Other adverse events that occurred in
 ≥ 10% of vemurafenib-treated patients and at an 
incidence more than twice that observed in the DTIC group included cutaneous SCC 
(cuSCC), skin papi[INVESTIGATOR_81875], arthralgia, headache, dysgeusia, pyrexia, peripheral edema, pain in extremity, myalgia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hyperkeratosis, seborrheic keratosis, and dry skin. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 36 Grade  ≥ 3 Adverse Events  
Fifty-nine percent of patients in the vemurafenib arm and 33% of patients in the DTIC 
arm experienced at least 1 adverse event that was Grade 3 or higher in intensity.  The percentage of vemurafenib-treated patients with cuSCC and keratoacanthoma (KA) were 16% and 9%, respectively, compared with <
 1% and 0% for DTIC-treated patients 
(all cases of cuSCC and KA were considered to be treatment-related, Grade 3 in intensity, and serious).  Other common Grade 3 or higher adverse events in the vemurafenib group included photosensitivity reaction (9%), rash (8%), maculo-papular rash (8%), and arthralgia (4%); the corresponding frequencies of these adverse events in the DTIC group were 0%, 0%, 0%, and <
 1%.  
1.2.4 Deaths and Serious Adverse Events among Patients Receiving 
Vemurafenib  
Across all studies, the majority of reported deaths were attributed to PD.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_843529]25026 (BRIM-3), 19% of patients in the vemurafenib group and 34% of patients in the DTIC group died. 
Across the NO25026 (BRIM-3), NP22657 (BRIM-2), and NP25163 studies, the most 
commonly reported vemurafenib-related serious adverse event was cuSCC.  In Study NO25026 (BRIM-3), 42% of patients in the vemurafenib group and 18% of patients in the DTIC group experienced at least 1 serious adverse event.  Thirty-one percent of patients in the vemurafenib group and 5% of patients in the DTIC group experienced at least [ADDRESS_1172210] common treatment-related serious adverse events in the vemurafenib group were cuSCC (17%) and KA (9%).  No other treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in
 > 1% of 
patients in either treatment group. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1172211] for Vemurafenib  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma  
In Studies NO25026, NP22657, and NP25163, 79 (23.5%), 34 (25.8%), and 10 (19.2%) patients treated with vemurafenib developed cuSCC/KA, respectively.  
Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_843530] a central 
dermatopathology laboratory designated by [CONTACT_843587] (independent of the site’s local pathologic diagnosis).  As of 12 May 2011, a total of 268 biopsies from 76 patients from Studies NO25026, NP22657, and NP25163 had been reviewed by [CONTACT_843588].  
Approximately half of all lesions were diagnosed as “SCC”; the other half were 
diagnosed as “other.”  The majority of SCC lesions (132 of 138 lesions, 96%) were classified as KA type (well-differentiated neoplas ms with very low potential for invasive 
or metastatic disease).  Lesions diagnosed as “other” included verruca vulgaris, actinic 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 37 keratosis, early KA, wart, benign keratosis, scar, no neoplasm, BCC, no diagnosis, and 
seborrheic keratosis. 
Although events of cuSCC are serious, cuSCC can be monitored and treated.  
The metastatic potential of cuSCC is < 5% in 5 years, especially for the KA type 
(Alam and Ratner 2001 ).  A careful follow-up or risk mitigation plan with r egular 
dermatological examinations has be
en established to monitor and treat cuSCC in 
patients receiving vemurafenib and during follow-up (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Second Primary Melanomas 
Eight skin lesions were reported as new primary melanomas in 7 patients in the Phase III, NO25026 study.  These lesions were managed with excision and without sequelae, and patients continued vemurafenib treatment for their underlying metastatic melanoma without dose adjustment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Neoplasms 
Non-Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
Rare cases of SCC of the head and neck have been reported in clinical trials where 
patients were treated with vemurafenib.  One case in study NO25026 involved a patient who had a confirmed tonsillar SCC after receiving vemurafenib for >
 200 days.  
The patient had a  pack-year history of  use.  The patient’s biopsy tested strongly positive for p16 by [CONTACT_9064], but no evidence of a RAS mutation or epi[INVESTIGATOR_843531].  
A second case occurred in study NP25163 (a PK/pharmacodynamic study).  This patient 
had an invasive SCC of the tongue.   was previously treated for metastatic melanoma 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], therapeutic vaccine (type not specified), and high dose interleukin-2, before enrollment on study NP25163.  The patient had no known risk factors for head-and-neck SCC, and preliminary testing of the tumor was negative for the presence of human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) genome.  
A careful follow-up or risk mitigation plan,  including head and neck examinations, anal 
examinations, pelvic examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans, has 
been established to monitor and treat SCC in patients who receive vemurafenib (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Colonic Polyps 
Rare cases of adenomatous colonic polyps have been reported in patients treated with vemurafenib for 2 or more years while enrolled in a clinical trial.  The clinical significance of colonic polyps is uncertain but physicians should be aware that they may occur in patients treated with vemurafenib. 
Progression of Cancers Associated with RAS Mutations 
Based on mechanism of action, vemurafenib may cause progression of cancers associated with RAS mutations.   

 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 38 One case of progression of NRAS-mutated chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 
occurred in a male patient with metastatic melanoma who had been treated with 
vemurafenib for  < 2 weeks ( Callahan et al. 2012 ).  After the first dose of vemurafenib, 
laboratory results showed a marked leukoc ytosis and monocytosis, and 
vemurafenib 
treatment was subsequently stopped.  In s ubsequent cycles, there was a temporal 
relationship between vemurafenib treatment and increase in WBC and absolute monocyte counts through multiple cycles of dechallenge and rechallenge.  In vitro studies demonstrated proliferation of the leukemic cell population upon stimulation with vemurafenib, an effect that was reversed upon addition of a MEKi.  Further, the cells exhibited dose-dependent and reversible activation of ERK in the NRAS-mutated leukemic clone.  A second case of progression of a pre-existing RAS-mutated malignancy (pancreatic adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutation) was reported with vemurafenib in 2014 ( Grey et al. 2014 ).  On the basis of its 
 mechanism of action, 
vemurafenib may cause progression of cancers associated with RAS mutations.  Vemurafenib should be used with caution in patients with a prior concurrent cancer associated with RAS mutation.  Full details are provided in the current vemurafenib IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] ECG Analysis 
The effects of single and multiple doses of vemurafenib (960 mg BID) on ECG measurement were evaluated in 132 adult patients with metastatic melanoma in the Phase II Study NP22657.  
Vemurafenib (960 mg BID) did not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect on heart 
rate (HR) and did not cause a meaningful change from the time-matched baseline in either the QRS or the PR (PQ) interval.  
Two patients (1.5%) developed treatment-emergent absolute QTc prolongation 
values
 > 500 ms (Grade 3), while 49 (37.1%) and 6 (4.5%) patients exhibited QTc 
prolongation values > 450 ms and >  480 ms, respectively.  No patients had 
treatment-emergent QT (uncorrected) values > 500 ms.  Maximal treatment-emergent 
individual QTc prolongation changes from baseline of > 30 ms were observed in 
58 (43.9%) patients, but only 1 (0.8%) patient exhibited a QTc prolongation change from baseline of >
 [ADDRESS_1172212] mean change from baseline of 12.8 ms (upper boundary of the 2-sided 90% CI of 14.9 ms) was observed at [ADDRESS_1172213] observed mean change from baseline of 15.1 ms (upper boundary of the 2-sided 90% CI of 17.7 ms) was detected at a pre-dose timepoint.  There were no cases of torsade des pointes in any vemurafenib-treated patient in metastatic melanoma studies.

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 39 [IP_ADDRESS] Liver Injury 
An analysis of liver− related adverse events reported with vemurafenib use showed that 
63 cases (out of estimated exposure of approximately 20,000 patients) of medically 
confirmed serious adverse events were consistent with drug− induced liver injury based 
on clinical chemistry criteria from the Drug −Induced Liver Injury Expert Working Group 
(Aithal et al. 2011 ).  Of the 63 cases, 2 were asse ssed as severe, both reported as 
hepatic failure.  There were no reported deaths among the 63 cases of liver injury; the outcome of one case of severe liver injury was reported as completely resolved with vemurafenib discontinuation, while information on the outcome of the second case of severe liver injury is not available at this time.  The median time to onset of the adverse events was 44 days after initial dose.  The median ALT to alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ratio was calculated as 1.5, which suggested a trend towards cholestatic pattern of liver injury.  The analysis did not reveal any risk factors or populations at risk. 
1.2.6 Other Adverse Events of Clinical Significance  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Dermatologic Reactions 
Severe dermatologic reactions have been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib, including rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_843532]. 
As of 31 March 2013, 12 cases of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic 
symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been observed with vemurafenib treatment, but no case was reported to result in death.  The time to onset was 7 to 25 days.  In the majority of patients (7), vemurafenib was discontinued.  Some patients (5) were treated with systemic steroids with corresponding improvement or resolution of symptoms.  
In addition, 2 patients with Grade 3 rash, who were treated with vemurafenib after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], had biopsies that showed pathology consistent with drug hypersensitivity reaction ( Harding et al. 2012 ).  Full details are av ailable in t
 he current vemurafenib IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
A review of the [COMPANY_002] safety database found neutropenia to be an uncommon (6 cases per 1000 person-years, 0.6%) adverse drug reaction associated with the use of vemurafenib, typi[INVESTIGATOR_825079] 6 −12 weeks of treatment.  It appeared to 
be reversible, usually within 2 weeks, with either temporary interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of vemurafenib, and in some cases was managed with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Panniculitis 
Twenty-six cases of medically confirmed panniculitis, out of an estimated 14,[ADDRESS_1172214] been reported; 85% of the cases were assessed as causally associated with vemurafenib treatment.  The majority of the cases have been in females (n
 = 21), and in most cases the latency was 10 −20 days after the 
initial dose.

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 40 [IP_ADDRESS] Pancreatitis 
As of the second quarter of 2014, an adverse drug reaction of pancreatitis has been 
identified in patients being treated with vemurafenib.  Seventeen cases of pancreatitis with no strong risk factors or alternative explanations were reported.  Eight of the 17 cases were assessed as likely associated with vemurafenib use based on event onset latency and re-challenge/de-challenge information.  The clinical presentation, including mild to moderate severity, was consistent with the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_267475]-induced pancreatitis ( Lankisch and Gottesleben 1995 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity 
Potentiation of radiation treatment toxicity is an adverse drug reaction for vemurafenib.  As of the fourth quarter of 2014, an adverse reaction of potentiation of radiation treatment toxicity has been identified in patients treated with radiation either prior, during, or subsequent to vemurafenib treatment.  This is based on 20 cases of radiation injuries adjudicated as radiation recall (n
 = 8) and radiation sensitization (n  = 12 cases).  
The nature and severity of the events in all 20 cases were evaluated as worse than expected for the normal tissue tolerance to therapeutic radiation with fatal outcome in 3 cases.  The reaction was seen in the skin, esophagus, lung, liver, rectum, and urinary bladder.  Vemurafenib should be used with caution when given concomitantly or 
sequentially with radiation treatment.  Fu ll details are provided in the current 
vemurafenib IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Acute Kidney Injury 
An adverse drug reaction of acute kidney in jury (AKI), including interstitial nephritis 
following vemurafenib administration, has been identified in patients being treated with vemurafenib.  The majority of these cases were characterized by [CONTACT_843589] (some observed in the setting of dehydration events) with recovery after dose modification.  Approximately 2% of cases were biopsy −proven 
interstitial nephritis, and approximately 3% of cases were acute tubular injury/necrosis.  No fatal cases were related to AKI.   
Renal function should be monitored in patients undergoing vemurafenib treatment.  
Vemurafenib dose modification guidelines should be utilized when applicable, and it is recommended to routinely monitor serum creatinine levels in all patients undergoing vemurafenib therapy.  
1.2.7 Safety of Vemurafenib in Combination with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_843533] a Phase I trial (CA 184161, sponsored by  [CONTACT_414]-Myers Squibb), asymptomatic 
Grade 3 increases in transaminases and bilirubin occurred with concurrent administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID) (Ribas et al. 2012 ).  All liver laboratory abnormalities were asympto m
 atic and reversible 
with permanent discontinuation of the study drugs or, in some cases, administration of corticosteroids.  On the basis of these data, concurrent administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_843534] ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172215] characterized substrate of BRAF is MEK.  Phosphorylation of MEK by [CONTACT_843590].  Cancer cells transformed by [CONTACT_843591]
V600 are 
exceptionally sensitive to MEK inhibition in vi tro.  Allosteric MEK inhibitors (MEKi) can 
result in G1 phase growth arrest in melanoma cells ( Smalley et al. 2006 ; Solit et al. 2006; 
Haass et al. 2008 ).  In vitro, MEKi reduce cell proliferation, soft  agar colony formation, 
and matrigel invasion of BRAFV600-mutant melanoma cells, and are also effective against 
BRAFV600 melanoma xenografts, suggesting a potentially important role for MEKi in 
melanoma and other tumors harboring the BRAFV600 mutation (Solit et al. 2006).  
1.3.2 Cobimetinib / XL518 (MEK Inhibitor)  
Cobimetinib (GDC-0973/RO5514041/XL518) is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, central components of the RAS/RAF pathway. 
1.3.3 Nonclinical Studi es with Cobimetinib  
Cobimetinib inhibits proliferation of a variety of human tumor cell lines by [CONTACT_147836]1 and MEK2.  In addition, cobimetinib inhibits ERK phosphorylation in xenograft tumor models (breast, lung, colon, and melanoma) and stimulates apoptosis.  Cobimetinib accumulates in tumor xenografts and remains at high concentrations in the tumor after plasma concentrations have declined.  The activity of cobimetinib to inhibit ERK1 phosphorylation is more closely correlated with its concentrations in tumor tissue than in plasma; in general, there is a good correlation between reduced ERK1 phosphorylation and efficacy in tumor xenogr aft models.  Tumor regression has been 
observed in several human tumor xenograft models.  This tumor regression was dose dependent with up to 100% regression at the highest doses tested. The models studied included CRC, malignant melanoma, breast carcinoma, and anaplastic lung carcinoma. 
1.3.4 Phase I Clinical Study of Cobimetinib  
Study MEK4592g is a multicenter, Phase I, non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study.  The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and MTD of cobimetinib administered orally as repeated doses in patients with solid tumors.  
As of the data cutoff date of 11 June 2013, 115 patients had been treated in 
Study MEK4592g. 
In Stage I, 36 patients with advanced solid malignancies were enrolled in successive 
cohorts and received cobimetinib on a 21-day on, 7-day off (21/7) dosing schedule at the following dose levels:  0.05 mg/kg, 0.10 mg/kg, and 0.20 mg/kg in liquid dosage 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 42 formulation and 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg in capsule formulation 
(Cohorts 1  − 8, respectively).  The maximal administered dose (MAD) during Stage I was 
80 mg; the MTD is 60 mg when cobimetinib is administered on a 21/7 dosing schedule. 
In Stage IA, 20 patients were treated with cobimetinib on a 14-day on, 14-day off (14/14) 
dosing schedule in successive cohorts at the following dose levels:  60 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg, and 125 mg in capsule formulation (Cohorts 1A− 4A, respectively).  The MAD of 
Stage IA was 125 mg, and the MTD is 100 mg when cobimetinib is administered on a 14/14 dosing schedule.  
Stages II and IIA are expansion stages that fu rther evaluate the safety, potential efficacy, 
and pharmacodynamic effects of cobimetinib at the MTDs determined in Stage I and 
Stage IA in patients with RAS − or RAF-mutant tumors.  
In Stage II, 20 patients were enrolled and received 60 mg cobimetinib on a 21/7 dosing schedule. In Stage IIA, 21 patients were been enrolled and received 100 mg cobimetinib on a 14/14 dosing schedule.  
In Stage III, 18 advanced solid tumor patients were enrolled and received 60 mg 
cobimetinib on a 21/[ADDRESS_1172216] of cobimetinib on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan and midazolam.  
1.3.5 Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Cobimetinib  
PK data are available from cancer patients treated with cobimetinib in the Phase I study (MEK4592g).  The PK parameters were reasonably consistent between both dosing schedules (14/14 and 21/7) at a given dose.   
Cobimetinib is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584], with t
max ranging from 1 hour to 6 hours across all doses.  
Cmax and AUC were dose proportional in the range from 0.05 mg/kg to 80 mg.  
Exposures at the 125-mg dose on a 14/14 schedule increased slightly more than 
dose-proportionally compared with exposures at 100 mg.  
On the basis of the mean terminal half-life (t 1/2) of approximately 48.8 hours, a 2-fold to 
3-fold accumulation is expected with daily oral dosing, and steady-state exposures 
should be achieved in 8 −10 days.  Cobimetinib has minimal renal elimination and is 
mainly eliminated by [CONTACT_843592].  EXEL-0382, a putative metabolite of Cobimetinib, was found at very low levels in plasma and, therefore, not monitored. 
Cobimetinib has also been administered to healthy subjects in the following clinical 
pharmacology studies: 
• MEK4952g:  Phase I absolute bioavailability study comparing oral and intravenous 
(IV) administration of cobimetinib (n
 = 13) 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 43 • MEK4953g:  Phase I relative bioavailability and food-effect study of cobimetinib 
(n = 20) 
• MEK4954g:  Phase I study evaluating the effect of rabeprazole, a proton-pump 
inhibitor (PPI), on the relative bioavailability of cobimetinib (n  = 20) 
 
The results from these 3 completed clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers 
indicate that the pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib do not appear to be altered by [CONTACT_843593]-administration with PPIs and that the absolute bioavailability of cobimetinib was 45.9% (90% CI:  39.74% −53.06%).

1.3.6 Safety in Phase I Clinical  Study of Cobimetinib (MEK4592g)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-Limiting Toxicities 
As of 8 October 2012, 4 DLTs had been observed in Stage I (21/7 dosing schedule) of Study MEK4592g.  At the 40-mg dose level, a DLT of Grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy was reported, which resolved following lactulose therapy, routine supportive care, and discontinuation of cobimetinib.  At the 60-mg dose level, a DLT of Grade 3 rash was reported that improved with skin toxicity  management and drug holiday.  At the 80-mg 
dose level, 2 DLTs were reported:  Grade 3 diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_40792]-diarrheal medications and Grade 3 rash.  
Two DLTs were observed in Stage IA (14/14 dosing schedule) of Study MEK4592g.  
At the 125-mg dose level, 1 patient had Grade 3 rash and another had Grade 3 blurred vision associated with neurosensory detachment of the retina.

In Study MEK4592g, visual disturbances associ ated with reversible accumulation of fluid 
between the layers of the retina were reported as related to cobimetinib in 12 patients:  4 at 125 mg (14/14), 5 at 100 mg (14/14), and 3 at 60 mg (21/7).  Of the 12 patients affected, 2 had subretinal fluid observed incidentally on an ophthalmologic examination without visual symptoms (1 patient each at 100 mg and 60 mg); 8 patients resumed cobimetinib at the same (2 at 60 mg and 3 at 100 mg) or a reduced dose (2 at 125 mg and 1 at 100 mg); and 1 had symptom recurrence after a dose reduction from 125 mg to 100 mg cobimetinib.  One DLT of Grade 3 blurred vision was reported at 125 mg; all other visual disturbances (including blurred vision and seeing flashing lights) were Grade 1−2.  All events resolved within 1 week of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_843535].  These visual 
disturbances associated with reversible accumulation of fluid between the layers of the retina occurred only with doses at or above the MTD. 
In Study MEK4752g, 8 (7%) of 123 patients experienced Grade 1 eye disorders, 
including photophobia, blurred vision, and visual impairment attributed to cobimetinib and/or GDC-0941, which resolved without study drug interruption.  
In Study NO25395, 1 patient, who had a history of uveitis, developed Grade 2 uveitis, 
which was effectively treated with steroid eye drops.  The epi[INVESTIGATOR_843536] 1 Day 22 coincident with development of a Grade 3 rash.  Vemurafenib was interrupted for the Grade 3 rash, which impr oved by [CONTACT_51199] 1 Day 27 with systemic 
steroid therapy.  Ophthalmologic examination at the time of the uveitis flare did not reveal any retinal abnormalities, such as neurosensory retinal detachment or retinal vein occlusion, and the patient continued on steroid eye drops as previously prescribed.   
One patient developed Grade 2 iritis in  left eye during Cycle 9 of study treatment.  
Ophthalmologic examination did not identify ce ntral serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) or 
retinal vein occlusion.  Vemurafenib was temporarily interrupted without minimal improvement in  symptoms.  Cessation of cobimetinib during the scheduled 14-days off did improve the patient’s symptoms.  The patient continued on the study combination and  symptoms were controlled with steroid eye drops.  
One patient who experienced Grade 2 blurred vision started having visual symptoms at 
Cycle 1 Day 2.  The patient noted “ ,” and the patient 
.  However, the patient was still able to drive to  
clinic appointment on Cycle 1 Day 8.  The patient was asked to stop cobimetinib, and an ophthalmology evaluation demonstrated serous retinopathy.  No surgical intervention was required, and, at Cycle 1 Day 14, the patient noticed improvement in  vision and restarted vemurafenib (the cobimetinib schedule was on 14 days on / 14 days off).

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 48 In subsequent cycles, the patient continued on combination therapy at vemurafenib 
960 mg BID and cobimetinib 40-mg once daily (QD) 14/14 without recurrence of serious retinopathy or visual symptoms.  
CPK  Elevation in Study MEK4592g and Study MEK4752 
In Study MEK4592g, there is limited information as to the frequency of CPK elevation in patients receiving cobimetinib monotherapy, because CPK testing has not been a part of the routine safety laboratory assessments.  One patient who received cobimetinib at 100 mg/day on a 14/14 schedule in Study MEK4592g had Grade 2− 3 CK-MM elevations.  
The patient was asymptomatic and without clinic al or laboratory evidence for myocardial 
injury or rhabdomyolysis.  
In Study MEK4752, 22 (17.9%) of [ADDRESS_1172222] experienced CPK elevations 
attributed to study drugs by [CONTACT_093].  Four (3.2%) of 123 patients experienced 
Grade 3 or higher CPK-MM elevations.  In Cohort 5 (40 mg cobimetinib
 + 130 mg 
GDC-0941, 21/7) 1 patient had a DLT and serious adverse event of Grade 4 CPK elevation.  In Cohort E (125 mg cobimetinib
 + 245 mg GDC-0941, intermittent MEK), 
1 patient experienced a Grade 4 CPK-MM elevation on Cycle 1 Day 15, with Grade 1 CK-MB elevation.  In Cohort C (125 mg cobimetinib
 + 130 mg GDC-0941, intermittent 
MEK), 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 CPK-MM elevation on Cycle 1 Day 18.  In the pancreatic expansion cohort (125 mg cobimetinib
 + 180 mg GDC-0941, intermittent 
MEK) 1 patient experienced Grade 3 CPK elev ation with elevated troponin in Cycle 1 
Day 8; study drugs were discontinued.  The CPK elevation resolved to Grade 2 within 2 days, and on Cycle 1 Day 9 an serious adverse event of Grade 4 anaphylaxis was treated with corticosteroids and resolved within 24 hours.  The majority of CPK elevations reported were asymptomatic and resolved with or without study interruption.  In Study NO25395, 14 (20%) patients have experience elevated CPK.  All CPK elevations were asymptomatic and were not associated with cardiac injury or rhabdomyolysis, and no interventions were required to specifically address this laboratory abnormality. 
1.3.8 Clinical Efficacy in Study MEK4592g  
Preliminary analyses of efficacy (anti-tumor activity) of cobimetinib have been performed with data from ongoing Study MEK4592g.  Although not a primary objective of the study, clinical efficacy was measured by [CONTACT_843595] 
(RECIST) v1.1, which classifies a favorable tumor response as a CR, a PR, or SD.    
As 29 May 2012, data from Study MEK4592g indicate that there was 1 unconfirmed 
complete response and 6 partial responses (5 confirmed and 1 unconfirmed).  Of these 7 responders, 6 were patients with BRAF
V600E mutation-positive melanoma and 1 was a 
patient with unknown mutation status.  These responses were durable with a median time on cobimetinib study drug treatment of 280 days (range 42 −721
 + days) (Table 3).

Poulikakos et al. 2011 ; Su et al. 2012; Wagle et al. 2011 ; Shi et al. 2012 ).  The addition 
of a MEKi to vemurafenib abrogates vemurafenib
 resistance ( Nazarian et al. 2010 ; 
Villanueva et al. 2010 ; Atefi et al. 2011; Poulikakos et al. 2011 ; Shi et al. 2012; 

 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 50 
Su et al. 2012).  These findings, together with preclinical evidence that combined 
inhibition of BRAF and MEK prevents the emergence of resistance ( Paraiso et al. 2010), 
support the clinical evaluation of co mbination therapy strategies incorpo
rating MEK 
inhibition with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) in order to combat emerging resistance. 
1.4.2 Preclinical Data of Combined BRAF and MEK Inhibition  
In an in vitro resistance model, cells resistant to both BRAF and MEK inhibition were exposed to vemurafenib, to a combination of vemurafenib with RO5068760 (a MEKi), or to RO5068760.  The combination of BRAF inhibition by [CONTACT_843596]5068760 (see Figure 1) abrogated the constitutive up-regulation of ERK 
phosphorylation, inhibited cell cycle progression,
 and induced apoptosis in the resistant 
cells to a greater extent than either agent alone.

Demonstrates a Synergistic Anti-Proliferation Effect in the 
Acquired-Resistance Melanoma Cell Model 
MEKi  = MEK inhibitor; RO5185426  = vemurafenib. 
 
An in vivo efficacy study in nude mice bearing BRAFV600-positive A375 melanoma 
xenograft tumors with acquired resistance to vemurafenib demonstrated synergistic 
anti-tumor activity when vemurafenib was combined with the MEKi RO5068760 (see Figure 2) ( Su et al. 2012 ).  Similar results have also been seen in the same model with 
cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib (se e the cobimetinib IB). 
These in vivo and in vitro studies 
suggest that combined RAF/MEK pharmacologic 
inhibition of the BRAF pathway is more effective than suppressing either alone.  Combined inhibition may suppress the emergence of the pathway-specific resistance in tumors harboring the BRAF
V600 mutation.  This supports the use of combined BRAF and 
MEK inhibition in previously untreated BRAFV600 mutation-positive patients with locally 
advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

1.4.3 Study NO25395 – Phase Ib Cobi metinib in Combination with 
Vemurafenib  
Study NO25395 (BRIM-7) is a Phase Ib study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and pharmacokinetics of combined MEK inhibition with cobimetinib and BRAF inhibition 
with vemurafenib.  This multicenter study has 2 stages:  a dose-escalation stage and a cohort-expansion stage. 
This study is being conducted in patients with BRAF
V600 mutation-positive, unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who are either vemurafenib naive or have 
progressed on vemurafenib treatment.  Key inclusion criteria include the presence of the V600 mutation in melanoma tumor tissue using the cobas
® [ADDRESS_1172224]  v1.1, ECOG Performance Status of  ≤ 1, and 
adequate hematologic and end organ function as assessed through key laboratory measures.   
All patients in the dose-escalation stage receive twice daily vemurafenib in combination 
with cobimetinib administered daily according to one of the following 28-day schedules:  14 consecutive days of study drug follo wed by a 14-day drug holiday (14/14), 
21 consecutive days of study drug followed by  a 7-day drug holiday (21/7), or as a 
continuous daily dose (28/0).  Each treatment cycle is 28 days. 
There are 10 dose-escalation cohorts of 3 −6 patients per cohort (see Figure 3).  Patients 
in Cohort 1 received vemurafenib at a dose of 720 mg BID c ontinually a
nd cobimetinib

Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 54 Adverse Events in Study NO25395   
As of the clinical cutoff date of 6 July 2012, out of the 70 patients treated with 
combination vemurafenib/cobimetinib, 68 patients (97.1%) had experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event.  Mild to moderate adverse events (Grade 1 or 2) 
were observed in 41 patients (58.6%), and 26 patients (37.1%) experienced Grade 3 (severe) or Grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events.  There was one Grade 5 adverse event:  a cerebrovascular accident.    
The most common treatment-emergent adver se events observed in Study NO25395 are 
shown in Table 5. 
Diarrhea (54.3%), non-acneiform rash (54.3%), fatigue (38.6%), nausea (35.7%), and 
photosensit 
ivity (31.4%) were the most common adverse events observed.  Most of 
these adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity.    
There were [ADDRESS_1172230] common Grade 3 
adverse events were non −acneiform rash (5 patients [7.1%]), diarrhea (4 patients [7%]), 
and ALP elevation (3 patients [4. 3%]).  There were 5 patients with Grade 4 adverse events (GGT elevation [2 patients–2.9%], tonsil SCC [1.4%], CPK elevation [1.4%], and GI hemorrhage [1.4%]).     
Liver function test (LFT) elevations were observed in 18 (25.7%) patients.  The most 
common abnormality noted was elevations in serum ALP.  Most elevations in LFTs were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. 
Fourteen (20.0%) patients experienced CPK elevation: 1 patient with a Grade 4 event, 
2 patients with Grade 3 events, and 9 patients with Grade 2 events.  These events were all attributed to either cobimetinib or the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib.  No reports of CPK elevation were associated with any symptoms or evidence of cardiac injury or rhabdomyolysis.  No interventions were required to specifically address this 
laboratory abnormality; all CPK elevations resolved spontaneously while the patient continued treatment with cobimetinib or during the treatment holiday period. 
The adverse event profile of vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib observed in 
this current update (clinical cutoff date 6 July 2012) is consistent with that previously observed at the earlier clinical cutoffs.

Four patients (5.7%) experienced Grade 3 diarrhea.  One patient in Cohort 2A 
(vemurafenib 720 mg BID and cobimetinib 100 mg QD on a 14/14 schedule) developed Grade 3 syncope, Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 rash, and Grade 3 VIIth cranial nerve paralysis.  This patient initially developed a Grade 3 rash on Cycle 1 Day 20.  The rash resolved after vemurafenib treatment was interrupted for 1 week.  On Cycle 2 Day 13, the patient developed Grade 3 diarrhea.  The patient had a Grade 3 syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_843537] 2 Day 14.  ECG evaluation showed no ECG abnormalities, including no QT interval abnormalities.  Vemurafenib was stopped (and cobimetinib was on treatment holiday) on Cycle 2 Day 14.  Vemurafenib 720 mg BID was restarted on Cycle 2 Day 22.  At Cycle 2 Day 27, this patient developed VIIth cranial nerve paralysis, which interfered with activities of daily living.  Cranio-spi [INVESTIGATOR_843538].  Both 
vemurafenib and cobimetinib were permanently discontinued after the patient decided to withdraw from the study.  After discontinuation of study drugs, there was gradual improvement of the VIIth cranial nerve paralysis with corticosteroid therapy over 6 weeks.  The investigators reported the VIIth nerve paralysis as related to vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib treatment. 
Grade 3 and higher LFT elevations occurred in 4 patients (5.7%). The Grade 3 and 
higher LFT abnormalities observed were: 
• One patient – Grade 3 ALP elevation and Grade 3 transaminase elevation 
• One patient – Grade 3 ALP elevation and Grade 4 GGT elevation • One patient – Grade 4 GGT elevation  
• One patient – Grade [ADDRESS_1172234]-operatively, the patient’s hemoglobin was 9.6 g/dL but approximately 4 weeks later, the patient’s hemoglobin decreased to 7.4 g/dL corresponding to Grade [ADDRESS_1172235] contributed to the anemia.

Serious Adverse Events in Study NO25395 
As of the clinical cutoff date of 6 July 2012, 15 patients (21.4%) had experienced serious 
adverse events in Study NO25395.  The se rious adverse events are listed in Table 8.  
One patient experienced a Grade 5 serious  adverse event in Study NO25395, a 
.  This patient was a -year-old 
 with metastatic 
melanoma with a known history of  
.  The patient 
started on Cycle 1 Day 1 of Study NO25395 on  with vemurafenib at 
720 mg BID and cobimetinib at 60 mg on a 21/[ADDRESS_1172236] overall tumor response.  On ,  developed  
and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified new brain metastasis, and .  On , 
while still recovering in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  had an acute stroke and died on . 
Non-cutaneous SCC (Grade 4 tonsillar SCC) was observed in [ADDRESS_1172237]-line treatment with vemurafenib 960 mg BID in Study NO25026 (BRIM-3) for approximately 13 months from .  
At the time of disease progression, abnormal metabolic activity in the patient’s left tonsil was noted on positron emission tomography (PET ) scan.  Otolaryngology evaluation at 
that time noted tonsillar enlargement, but no additional diagnostic or therapeutic intervention was undertaken at that time.  The patient was subsequently enrolled in Study NO25395 (BRIM-7) and started combination therapy in Cohort 3 (vemurafenib 960 mg BID
 + cobimetinib 60 mg on a 14/14 schedule) in .  The patient 
developed melanoma disease progression after 4 cycles of treatment and discontinued the study in .  The patient's left tonsil was re-assessed in early  

 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 62 and at that time was noted to be larger.  Clinical staging around that time (including CT 
scan) showed left tonsillar mass and regional lymph node enlargement.  A biopsy of the left tonsillar mass was performed shortly thereafter, which corroborated the diagnosis of SCC but, due to crush artifact, it was difficult to assign pathologic stage.  The biopsy stained strongly for p16, which is suggestive of HPV-mediated oncogenesis.  That patient had an additional risk factor for SCC of the head and neck, a  pack −year 
 history.  The patient subsequently underwent  in , 
which identified muscle invasion (T4), then subsequently received radiotherapy.  Biomarker assessments on the  tissue confirmed the presence of HPV 
genome (serotype 16) in tumor tissue.  There was no evidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_843539]. 
One patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_843540], for Grade 1 syncope and 
Grade 4 GI hemorrhage.  The Grade 1 syncope occurred on Cycle 1 Day 19 while at church.  There were no ECG abnormalities or cardiac enzyme elevation.  Tilt-table testing was abnormal, suggesting a neurocardiogenic cause.  The patient was subsequently discharged and continued on study therapy without any dose modifications.  At Cycle 2 Day 22, the patient developed GI hemorrhage requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569900].  The bleeding source was found to be a pre-existing left mesenteric lesion. The patient subsequently underwent  and continued on study 
therapy. 
One patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779185] 3 convulsions in Cycle 3.  This patient had a 
known history of  that was controlled on .  Brain MRI performed 
after the onset of  did not identify any brain metastasis.   
was added to improve  control and the patient continued of study therapy attaining a partial response.  
One patient developed well differentiated cuS CC, keratoacanthoma-type, while on study 
in Cohort 1B (vemurafenib 960 mg BID
 + cobimetinib 60 mg QD 21/7).  The cuSCC was 
identified on the skin of the patient’s left lower leg during Cycle 3 of study therapy.  
The patient underwent complete resection of the cuSCC and continued on study therapy. 
One patient developed Grade 2 facial edema and Grade 2 maculo-papular rash at 
Cycle 1 Day 10.  The patient required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_843541], which resolved rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; the patient was able to restart study therapy 1 day later without dose modification.  This patient subsequently was placed on a tapering course of oral corticosteroids without recurrent symptoms.  This patient also developed Grade 3 LFT elevation at Cycle 2 Day 22 that was managed with interruption of vemurafenib. 
One other patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779185] 3 maculo-papular rash.  This 
treatment-naïve patient was treated with vemurafenib 960 mg BID
 + cobimetinib 80 mg 
QD on a 14/14 schedule. The patient developed a Grade 3 generalized maculo-papular

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 63 rash with Grade 1 fever, chills, and CPK elevation, leading to interruption both study 
drugs on Cycle 1 Day 10. The patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  No infectious etiology was identified.  The rash resolved at Cycle 1 Day 16 and the patient resumed vemurafenib at 720 mg BID (cobimetinib was not given because of 14 day off period). 
One patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_779185] [ADDRESS_1172238] compression was not identified during the evaluation.  The patient’s pain medication was optimized and the patient was subsequently discharged.  The patient continued to receive study therapy during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
One patient was admitted for Grade 3 wound infection.  This patient developed new 
brain metastasis and was taken off Study NO25395 as a result of disease progression.  Eight days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003],  
.  The wound was sutured in the emergency room, but 6 days later the patient 
complained of discharge from  wound, which was diagnosed as a Grade 3 wound infection.  The patient was admitted and administered IV antibiotics and discharged 2 days later on oral antibiotics.  
One patient developed hyperthyroidism during Cycle 2 Day 8 of treatment with 
vemurafenib and cobimetinib.  This patient had previously received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_843542] 7 months prior to starting in  Study NO25395.  During the visit on Cycle 2 
Day 8 of study therapy, the patient developed Grade 1 fatigue, Grade 1 anorexia, and Grade 2 diarrhea.  An endocrinologic evaluation showed that the patient had a thyroid-stimulating hormone level 0.011 mIU/L (institution’s normal 0.4 −4.0 mIU/L) and 
free thyroxine level over 6 ng/mL (institution’s normal 0.89 −1.76 ng/ml).  The patient was 
started on proplythiouracil and continued on study therapy.  However, the patient’s fatigue and anorexia remained at Grade 1 and diarrhea resolved to Grade 1 with loperamide and diphenoxylate.

1.4.4 Primary and Final Analysis of Study GO28141  
Primary analysis of study GO28141 was conducted with a data cutoff of 9 May 2014 (Larkin et al. 2014 ).  At the time, median PFS for the 247 patients enrolled in the 
vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm was 9.9 months versus 6.2 months for the 248 patie 
nts 
enrolled in the vemurafenib + placebo arm (hazard ratio:  0.51; 95% CI:  0.39, 0.68).  
Similarly objective response rate (ORR) was 68% versus 45% (p < 0.0001) for 
vemurafenib + cobimetinib versus vemurafenib +  placebo.  Final analysis of OS occurred 
with a data cutoff of [ADDRESS_1172240] 2015.  At the time, median OS was 22.3 months for patients treated with vemurafenib + cobimetinib versus 17.4 months for patients treated 
with vemurafenib + placebo (hazard ratio:  0.70; 95% CI:  0.55, 0.90).  Overall, safety 
was consistent with a positive benefit-risk profile for the combination.   
1.5 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
The clinical activity of vemurafenib in BRAFV600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma 
patients has been substantiated by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_843544] (NO25026 [BRIM-3]).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_843545], disease progression occurs after a median of approximately 6 −[ADDRESS_1172241] been described that result in reactivation of the RAS/RAF pathway ( Johannessen et al. 2010 ;

Shi et al. 2012 ; Su et al. 2012 ).  Addition of a MEKi to vemurafenib abro gates

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 67 vemurafenib resistance ( Nazarian et al. 2010 ; Villanueva et al. 2010 ; Atefi et al. 2011 ; 
Poulikakos et al. 2011 ; Shi et al. 2012 ; Su et al. 2012 ).  These finding s, together with 
nonclinical evidence that combined inhibition of BRAF and MEK prevents the emergence 
of resistance ( Paraiso et al. 2010), support the clinical evaluation of combination thera py 
strategies 
incorporating MEKi with BRAFi to combat emerging resistance. 
Data from the ongoing Phase Ib Study NO25395 (BRIM-7) has identified the proposed investigational dose (vemurafenib 960 mg BID on Days 1 −28 and cobimetinib 60 mg QD 
Days 1−21, in 28-day treatment cycles) as safe and well tolerated.  Further 
characterization of the safety profile of the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib at their respective single-agent MTD is ongoing in the expansion stage of the Phase Ib study.  
The risks associated with this combination therapy are further reduced through a safety 
plan that incorporates into the eligibility cr iteria to exclude patients at unacceptable risk, 
enhanced monitoring of all patients, specific risk mitigation plans, and dose modification guidelines.  An independent DSMB reviewed unblinded safety data from the study every [ADDRESS_1172242] profile of the combination observed in the Phase Ib study, the potential benefits of combination therapy and the extent of safety monitoring proposed, the potential benefit for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who participate in Study GO28141 outweigh the potential risks.

evaluation (echocardiogram or MUGA) are evaluated throughout the study. 
Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or 
withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs earliest.  Patients on the vemurafenib and placebo treatment arm will be eligible to cross over to the vemurafenib and cobimetinib treatment arm prior to disease progression so long as the patient has not discontinued vemurafenib treatment should the investigator feel that the addition of cobimetinib may benefit the patient and the patient provides informed consent and continues to be followed for survival.  Patients who have previously discontinued vemurafenib and who 
are receiving only placebo may not cross over and should discontinue all study treatment. 
3.[ADDRESS_1172246]. 
Patients may continue on study treatment until the development of progressive disease, 
unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal.  Patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason will be followed for SCC according to the risk management plan (see Section 5.1.3), followed for disease progression and followed for survival until 
death, withdrawal of cons ent, or they are lost to f
ollow-up.  Patients who start 
subsequent anti-cancer treatment after study treatment discontinuation will still need to be followed for survival and SCC.   
3.[ADDRESS_1172247] Dosage/Regimen  
The vemurafenib dose selected was based on clinical efficacy and safety initially 
observed in Study PLX06-02 (Phase I) at the MTD of 960 mg BID.  This was further characterized in Studies NP22657 (Phase II) and NO25026 (Phase III) of vemurafenib in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  This dose is the recommended starting dose of vemurafenib. 
Study MEK4592g (Phase I) identified the MTD of single-agent cobimetinib to be 60 mg 
QD on a 21-day on, 7-day off (21/7) schedul e and at 100 mg QD on a 14-day on, 14-day 
off (14/14) schedule.  The 21/7 dosing schedule for cobimetinib offers a longer duration of drug exposure and consequently, a more prolonged suppression of MEK compared to the 14/14 schedule.  The lower dose of cobimetinib in the 21/7 schedule is also associated with a lower rate of adverse events (including Grade ≥
 3 adverse events).   
In Study NO25395 (Phase Ib), the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib 21/7 was delivered at their respective single-agent MTDs.  This dose has cleared the DLT criteria and shown to be tolerable.  
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 72 Continuous dosing of cobimetinib was not explored in the monotherapy Phase I study 
(MEK4592g).  In Study NO25395, two dose cohorts have been designated to explore continuous dosing cobimetinib with vemurafenib.  This dose level may potentially result in poor tolerability at doses that exceed the single −agent MTD of cobimetinib, and result 
in significant dose reductions that may not adequately suppress the activity of MEK in the tumor cells.  
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
The proposed study will enroll treatment-naïve  patients with unresectable locally 
advanced Stage IIIc or metastatic melanoma as defined by [CONTACT_267516] (AJCC) classification v.7.  This study will be conducted only in patients whose melanoma harbors the BRAF V600 mutation.  This represents the population for which vemurafenib is indicated. The cobas
® [ADDRESS_1172248] a baseline screening ECG and those whose QTc interval is
 > [ADDRESS_1172249], patients are required to undergo ophthal mologic examination to evaluate risk 
factor for or findings indicative of neurosensory retinal detachment, CSCR or retinal vein occlusion (RVO) prior to starting study treatment.  Patients with such conditions will be excluded. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_1172250] been assessed, placebo plus vemurafenib patients will be allowed to cross over to active therapy (vemurafenib plus cobimetinib) so long as the patient has not discontinued vemurafenib and provided that the treating physician believes that there will be additional benefit given that the 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 73 combination has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile over single-agent 
vemurafenib. 
3.3.4 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
A sparse sampling strategy will be applied in this study.  Samples for PK characterization of cobimetinib and vemurafenib will be collected as outlined in Appendix 2.  Samples will be collected on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 2.  The sampling schedule is designed to 
enable characterization of vemurafenib 
and cobimetinib using population PK methodology (pop PK) for characterization following first dose (Day 1) and steady-state (Day 15).  In addition, the vemurafenib PK data from Arm A and Arm B will allow eval uation of whether cobimetinib alters 
vemurafenib pharmacokinetics.  The cobimetinib PK data from Arm B will allow comparison to single-agent cobimetinib data to evaluate whether exposures are altered when administered in combination with vemurafenib. 
3.3.5 Rationale for Collection of DNA for Exploratory Analyses of 
Pharmacogenetic Polymorphisms  
Genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs, affecting their safety and efficacy.  For example, patients who carry defective alleles of the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which facilitates the metabolism and excretion of SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), are at higher risk for adverse events associated with the use of standard doses of irinotecan ( O’Dwyer and Catalano 2006 ).  
Results from  in vitro metabolism st
udies suggest that cobimetinib is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 enzymes CYP3A.  A blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from all patients in this study for potential pharmacogenetic analysis of genes or biomarkers that may affect the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib and cobimetinib.  The decision to analyze the samples will be based on a review of the PK data.  For example, if a patient in a given cohort has substantially higher cobimetinib plasma levels than other patients in that cohort, he or she may carry a defective allele of a gene important in the metabolism or transport of cobimetinib.  The genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_843546]. 
The pharmacogenetic analysis, if needed, will be performed on identifiable DNA samples, 
because it is necessary to link a patient’s PK data with genotype.  This analysis may be restricted to the evaluation of genes that may be involved in the pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib and vemurafenib (e.g., drug metabolism, disposition, or elimination genes).  Samples may be stored and analyzed up to 5 years after completion of the study, at which time all DNA samples collected for this analysis will be destroyed. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172251] of analyses may be modified on the basis of new information. 
Investigation of Response and Resistance Biomarkers
 
This study may explore biomarkers associated with treatment response and resistance, 
including intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibition in tumor tissues at baseline and at the time of disease progression. 
Given the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma tumors, the magnitude of response to 
combined BRAF/MEK inhibition may be different in certain tumors.  To identify mechanisms of resistance, molecular analyses may include assessment of genetic and activation status of the targeted MAPK pathway, potential escape mechanisms such as receptor tyrosine kinases and PI3K/PTEN pathways, and components of the tumor stroma (e.g., tumor infiltrating lymphocytes).  These analyses may be conducted at the DNA, RNA, protein, and cell levels.  In addition, expression of melanoma prognostic markers and alternative drug targets may be explored.  These analyses are essential to identify patients who will benefit the most from the combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_843547], which could help in considering future treatments.   
Investigation of biomarkers in plasma samples 
 
BRAFV600  mutation may be evaluated both in tumor biopsies and in plasma collected 
during this study.  It has been shown that tumor-specific mutations can be identified in 
plasma of patients.  Analysis and correlation of BRAF mutations in plasma and biopsy will help to further evaluate the option of using plasma for the detection of tumor specific mutations. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_1172252] of these treatments, given the externally validated data generated from the EQ-5D self-reported questionnaire.  The collection of this type of data will provide greater insights for both the medical and patient communities to understand patient-reported value and quality of life when exposed to the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib treatments.

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 75 3.4 OUTCOME MEASURES 
3.4.1 Efficacy Outcome Measures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure 
The primary outcome measure for this study is as follows: 
• PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease 
progression, as determined by [CONTACT_26309] v1.1 ( Appendix 3), or 
death from any cause, whichever comes first.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures 
The secondary outcome measures are as follows: • Overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause   
• Objective response rate for patients with measurable disease at baseline, defined 
as complete or partial response as assessed by [CONTACT_843580] 
v1.1 
• Duration of response for patients with measurable disease at baseline, defined as 
the time from first occurrence of a documented objective response until the time of 
disease progression, as determined by [CONTACT_843601] v1.1, or death from any cause during the study (i.e., within [ADDRESS_1172253] dose of study treatment) 
• PFS as assessed by [CONTACT_843582] v1.1 
 
3.4.2 Safety Outcome Measures  
Safety outcome measures for this study are as follows:

graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0 
• Adverse events of special interest:  any RVO; any retinal detachment or CSCR; 
Grade ≥  3 photosensitivity; Grade ≥ 2 LVEF reduction; Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1172254] in combination with either an 
elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]; Grade ≥  3 QT 
interval prolongation; and any cutaneous and non-cutaneous primary malignancy, including SCC, KA, BCC, and new primary melanoma.  
• Changes in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory results during the course of

Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 76 Exploratory exposure-response analyses for efficacy and safety endpoints, including 
QTc, will be performed 
3.4.4 Patient-Reported Outcome Measures  
The PRO measures for this study are as follows: 
• EORTC QLQ-C30 
• EuroQol's EQ-5D Questionnaire  
 
The PRO questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D) were supplied in the local 
language(s) of each participating country.  
3.4.5 Exploratory Outcome Measures  
The exploratory biomarker analyses in tumor tissue may investigate potential intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to MEK and BRAF inhibition.  Pre-treatment tumor tissue (i.e., archived material or biopsies collected during screening, prior to initiation of study treatment) and tumor biopsies during treatment (Cycle 2 Day 15) and at the end of study treatment (at the time of PD) will be required. 
In order to investigate if chromosomal and molecular genetic aberrations are linked to 
therapeutic outcome and development of severe adverse events in patients treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib, DNA may be isolated from a single whole blood collected at baseline as well as tumor tissues. 
Additional efficacy exploratory analyses will include PFS rates and OS rates at fixed 
timepoints (e.g., 3, 6, 9, 12 months, etc.). 
3.5 MINIMIZATION OF BIAS 
Patients will be randomly assigned to receive vemurafenib and placebo or vemurafenib and cobimetinib through use of an interactive response system (IxRS).  Placebo tablets for cobimetinib and packaging configurations will have physical characteristics that will not permit their identification as distinct from those of cobimetinib.  
Following the final efficacy analysis and ext ensive evaluation of safety data, quarterly 
DSMB review of unblinded safety data will no longer occur.  Sponsor personnel will not 
have access to by-arm effica cy and safety summaries or li stings prior to the formal 
reporting of the primary efficacy results. 
Only when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the safety of the 
patient, the investigator may unblind a patient’s treatment assignment.  In such cases, the IxRS system will be used to allow disclosure of an individual patient’s treatment assignment to the treating investigator.  If the investigator wishes to know the identity of the study drug for any other reason, he or she should contact [CONTACT_66324] (see Section 4.2).

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT, BLINDING, AND 
UNBLINDING 
After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility has been established, 
each patient will be assigned an identification number and be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment arms through use of an IxRS.   
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_843602] (unresectable Stage IIIc, M1a, and 
M1b; M1c) and region (North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand/others).  A stratified, permuted, block randomization scheme will be used to obtain approximately a 1:1 ratio between the 2 treatment groups.  There is no pre-specified gender or ethnicity distribution in this study.  It is expected that enrollment into this study will be representative of the gender and ethnicity distribution found in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in the participating countries. 
The investigator, patient, and Sponsor will be blinded to treatment assignment until 
completion of the final efficacy analysis of OS.   
Prior to unblinding at the final overall survival efficacy analysis: 
Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations.  In such cases, 
the IxRS system will be used to allow disclosure of an individual patient’s treatment assignment to the treating investigator.  If the investigator wishes to know the identity of the study drug for any other reason, he or she should contact [CONTACT_66324].  The investigator should document and provide an explanation for any 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 81 premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to a serious adverse 
event).  
Per health authority reporting requirements, the treatment code will be available through 
IxRS to the [COMPANY_002] Drug Safety Group for a ll unexpected serious adverse events that are 
considered by [CONTACT_66325] (see Section 5.7). 
The investigator may re quest unblin
ding of a patient’s treatment assignment only when 
knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the safety of the patient.  In such cases, the IxRS system will be used to allow disclosure of an individual patient’s treatment assignment to the treating investigator.  Any site requests for unblinding, for any reason apart from emergency situations, require consultation with the [COMPANY_002] Medical Monitor. 
Upon completion of the final overall survival efficacy analysis: 
Upon completion of the final OS analysis and approval by [CONTACT_093]’s local IRB/EC, 
investigators will receive a list of active patients at their site with their treatment assignments.  Unblinded patients in the placebo arm who remain on vemurafenib and who choose not to cross over will no longer receive placebo and will continue to receive vemurafenib only.

tablets should never be chewed, cut, or crushed. 
Upon completion of the final OS analysis, patients in the placebo arm who are unblinded 
and choose not to cross over to cobimetinib will no longer need to receive placebo and will continue to receive vemurafenib only, unless they had previously discontinued vemurafenib, in which case they will discontinue all study treatment.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Vemurafenib 
Vemurafenib will be taken orally, at a starting dose of 960 mg (4 tablets) BID.  The first dose of vemurafenib should be taken in the morning, and the second dose should be taken in the evening, at least [ADDRESS_1172267] dose (the ideal interval between doses is 12 hours).  
Vemurafenib can be taken with or without a meal, and should be taken with a glass of 
water.  The vemurafenib tablets should never be chewed, cut, or crushed. 
4.3.[ADDRESS_1172268] Accountability

Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172269]-Study Access to Ve murafenib and Cobimetinib  
The Sponsor will evaluate the appropriateness of continuing to provide vemurafenib and 
cobimetinib to study patients after evaluating the primary efficacy outcome measure and safety data gathered in the study; these analyses may be conducted prior to completion of the study.  If these data are medically and statistically significant, the Sponsor may amend the protocol to continue to provide vemurafenib and cobimetinib in an open-label extension study to patients in that tr eatment arm who have shown a demonstrable 
benefit from vemurafenib and cobimetinib treatment during this study (as measured by [CONTACT_843605]-assessed PFS).  
4.4 CONCOMITANT TREATMENT  
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal/homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 through the end-of study treatment visit.  All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hor mone-replacement therapy, or maintenance 
therapy should continue their use as outlined in the eligibility criteria.  Please note that 
potential interactions between vemurafenib and hormonal contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.  
Pain medications may be administered according to local standard practice guidelines 
while the patient is in the study. 
Anti-emetics and anti-diarrheal medications should not be administered prophylactically 
before initial treatment with study drugs.  At the discretion of the investigator, prophylactic anti-emetic and anti-diarrheal  medication(s) may be used per standard 
clinical practice before subsequent doses of study drugs.   
Hematopoietic growth factors should not be administered prophylactically before initial 
treatment with study drugs.  Hematopoietic growth factors may be administered according to local guidelines if indicated during the course of the study. 
4.4.[ADDRESS_1172270] 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment, unless otherwise specified below: 
• Any prior or concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of advanced melanoma, 
either approved by [CONTACT_267541], including chemotherapy, 
radiation therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or 
investigational agents is prohibited.  Patients who received prior adjuvant 
immunotherapy are allowed on the study.

• Grapefruit juice (potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor) 
 
Patients who require the use of any of these agents will be discontinued from study 
treatment and followed for safety outcomes for [ADDRESS_1172272].  These patients will also continue to be followed for survival.  
4.4.4 Medication Precautions in Case of Drug −Drug Interactions  
Vemurafenib  
Results from an in vivo drug  − drug interaction study in patients with cancer 
demonstrated that vemurafenib is a moderate cytochrome 1A2 inhibitor, a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor, and a CYP3A4 inducer.  Concomitant use of vemurafenib and agents with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 is not recommended as vemurafenib may alter their concentrations.  If co-administration cannot be avoided, exercise caution and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 substrate drug. 
Based on in vitro data, vemurafenib is a substrate of CYP3A4, and therefore, 
concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter vemurafenib concentrations.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole) and inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) should be used with caution when co-administered with vemurafenib.  Mild induction of CYP2B6 by [CONTACT_843606] a vemurafenib concentration of 10 µM.  It is currently unknown whether vemurafenib at a plasma level of 100 µM observed in patients at steady state (approximately 50 µg/mL) may decrease pl asma concentrations of concomitantly 
administered CYP2B6 substrates, such as bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. 
Co-administration of vemurafenib resulted in an 18% increase in AUC of S-warfarin 
(CYP2C9 substrate) and as such, co-administration of vemurafenib and warfarin warrants caution.  While the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
50) value of 
vemurafenib was 11.[ADDRESS_1172273] appears unlikely.  
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 86 Cobimetinib  
Based on in vitro data, cobimetinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and UGT2B7.  It has also 
been shown to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.  A study in cancer patients was conducted to determine if there is any clinically significant inhibition of a probe substrate of CYP3A (midazolam) or CYP2D6 (dextrom ethorphan).  Preliminary results from the 
study indicate no effect on either CYP3A or CYP2D6.  In the presence of steady-state cobimetinib, midazolam exposure was unchanged relative to midazolam alone, with a geometric mean ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.32) for midazolam AUC
0−∞.  When 
dextromethorphan was administered with st eady-state cobimetinib, dextromethorphan 
exposure was unchanged as compared to dextromethorphan alone, with geometric 
mean ratio of 1.04  (95% CI: 0.87, 1.23) for dextromethorphan AUC 0−∞.  Given that 
cobimetinib is a substrate of CYP3A, potent inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 (listed below) may affect cobimetinib exposures and hence should be avoided.  If use of one these drugs is necessary, the risks and benefits and potential alternatives should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to its concomitant use with cobimetinib.   
• Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nef azodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, troleandomycin, and voriconazole. 
• Strong CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1172274] of typi[INVESTIGATOR_825080]1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A narrow therapeutic substrates that require caution for 
administering with vemurafenib.  CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 substrates and CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors.  The website http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ provides 
information on drugs that are substrates, inhibitors and inducers of the various human 
cytochrome P450 enzymes (Appendix 11). 
4.4.[ADDRESS_1172275] a pre-existing cardiac disease or ECG abnormality that may predispose them to cardiac dysrhythmia.  Investigators should closely monitor patients who are on medications and/or supplements that may affect the QT interval.  Alternative treatment options for medications known to affect QT interval should be discussed with each patient prior to their inclusion into this study.  A complete list of medications that may cause QT interval prolongation is provided in Appendix 9.  Please refer to 
http://www.azcert.org/ for additional information and references. 
Vemurafenib
 
The effect of vemurafenib 960 mg administered BID on QTc intervals was evaluated in a 
multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 132 previously treated patients with 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 87 BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma (Study NP22657).  No large changes 
in mean QTc interval from baseline (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected in the trial.  However, 
vemurafenib is associated with concentration-dependent QTc prolongation.  In the first 
month of treatment, the largest mean change from baseline of 12.8 ms (upper boundary of the 2-sided 90% CI-14.9 ms) was observed at [ADDRESS_1172276] mean change from baseline of 15.1 ms (upper boundary of the 2-sided 90% CI-17.7 ms) was observed at a pre-dose timepoint. 
Cobimetinib
 
Cobimetinib was shown to inhibit the human ether-à-go-go (hERG) channel activity with 
a concentration required to achieve 50% inhibition of 1 μM using single cellular 
electrophysiological recordings.  The in vitro hERG mean IC 50 value of 1 μM 
(531 ng/mL, unbound), is approximately 8-fold higher than peak exposures up to 64 ng/mL (free-fraction corrected) at the maximal dose evaluated in Phase I (125 mg) and 27-fold higher than peak exposures at the proposed Phase III dose (60 mg, free C
max  = 19 ng/mL).  Moreover, no effects on ECG or hemodynamic parameters were 
observed in a dedicated cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in telemetry-instrumented dogs, at up to 5.2 ng/mL (free-fraction corrected C
max).  
Triplicate ECG data were collected in all patients in MEK4592g (Phase Ia single-agent study) and were analyzed for concentration-QTc relationship using matching cobimetinib concentration data.  ECG data were available from doses of 0.05 mg/kg to 125 mg QD. A preliminary analysis of concentration-QTc shows no relationship between cobimetinib plasma concentration and QTcF or QTcF change from baseline.  The probability of observing QTc outlying values >
 500 ms is very unlikely in the plasma concentration 
range up to 1140 ng/mL. At 60 mg QD (the planned dose for combination with vemurafenib), the mean C
max was 306 ng/mL and hence unlikely to be associated with 
any QTc prolongation based on this analysis. 
In this study (GO28141), no additive clinical effect on QT interval prolongation was 
observed when patients were treated with cobimetinib  in combination with vemurafenib. 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The schedule of study assessments and procedures are detailed in Appendix 1. 
4.5.1 Description of Study Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] BRAFV600 Mutation Testing  
BRAFV600 mutation testing must be performed with the cobas [ADDRESS_1172277] ( Appendix 10).  Only patients whose melanoma tumors test positive for the 
BRAFV600 mutation on the cobas® [ADDRESS_1172278] be performed prior to 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172279]-of-care tests or examinations 
may be performed concurrently with the BRAFV600 mutation testing.  The 28-day window 
(Day -28 to Day -1) for performing screening assessments opens at the time the first 
additional screening assessment is performed after the cobas® [ADDRESS_1172280] result is available. 
The cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation may be tested at a [COMPANY_002]-designated Central 
Reference Laboratory or at a non-[COMPANY_002]-designated laboratory.  If a 
non− [COMPANY_002]-designated laboratory is used for BRAFV600 mutation testing, documentation 
of the test procedures and results must be included as source documentation. 
Archival or newly obtained formalin-fix ed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens 
may be utilized for the cobas® [ADDRESS_1172281].  Tissues obtained from 
fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] (FNA) are not permitted.  FFPE tumor block or [ADDRESS_1172282].   
For patients eligible for the study, additional testing will be performed at [COMPANY_002] or in a centralized specialty laboratory.  These additional investigations will be done retrospectively and not influence patient’s eligibility for this study.  
For patients whose tumor samples undergo cobas
® 4800 BRAF V600 mutation testing at 
a [COMPANY_002]-designated central testing facility, tumor blocks from the patients who are not 
eligible for the study will be returned after mutation testing has been completed.

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 89 [IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations 
Patients will be asked specifically about skin and vision changes as part of each physical 
examination in addition to interval medical history.  Note : If vital signs and physical 
examination are assessed within [ADDRESS_1172283] to be repeated at Day 1. 
A complete physical examination should include measurement of height and weight, and 
head, eye, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT), neck, cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], GI, and neurological system exams.  Examination of the HEENT must include visual inspection and/or palpation of the oral cavity and oropharynx, and palpation of the draining lymph nodes of the neck.  Visual evaluation of the anus and digital evaluation of the anal canal is required as part of the physical examination at screening and thereafter per local standard of care for vemurafenib-treated patients.  Endoscopic examination (colonoscopy or sigm oidoscopy) is not required for examination 
of the anus or anal canal. 
All female patients will undergo a pelvic examination, including visual inspection of the 
uterine cervix and Papanicolaou (Pap) smear at screening and thereafter per local standard of care.  Pelvic examinations, including Pap smear, which were conducted up to 12 months prior to screening and found to be normal need not be repeated at screening. 
HEENT, anal, and gynecological examinations are part of the surveillance measures for 
identifying non-cuSCC (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Any non-cuSCC should be staged and 
managed per the local st andard of ca
re. 
Changes from baseline should be noted at each subsequent physical examination.  New 
or worsened physical exam abnormalities shoul d be recorded as adverse events, if 
appropriate.  An interval medical history should be obtained coincident with each follow-up physical exam, which documents changes from baseline in new or concomitant diseases, medications, and allergies.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor and Response Evaluations 
Following formal institutional approval of  protocol v5, patients on study should be 
evaluated for disease progression according to the local standard of care with the same radiographic method employed during the conduct of the study.  The frequency of tumor assessments may be according to the local standard of care and treating physician’s usual practice. 
The Independent Review Committee will discontinue the review of tumor assessment 
data following the final PFS analysis.

[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Reported Outcomes 
Following approval of v5 of the protocol, PRO data will no longer be collected.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Plasma concentrations of vemurafenib and cobimetinib will be measured in a central laboratory using validated assays.  Venous blood samples will be collected according to the schedule of PK assessments (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 2) at the following 
timepoints: 
• 1
 − [ADDRESS_1172288] dose on Cycle 1, Day 1 
• Pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15 ± 3 days 
• 2  − [ADDRESS_1172289]-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15 ± 3 days 
• Pre-dose on Cycle 2, Day 15 ± [ADDRESS_1172290]; however, the 
time of the last meal must be recorded in the eCRF. 
The procedures for the collection, handling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_843549].  PK samples for analysis of vemurafenib concentration will be collected in sodium heparin tubes and will require 2 mL of venous blood at each timepoint.  PK samples for analysis of cobimetinib concentration will be collected in K2-EDTA tubes and will require 3 mL of venous blood at each timepoint. 
The total volume of blood collected for PK assessments will be approximately 16 −20 mL 
during the entire study.  Unscheduled PK samples are not considered in this calculation 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Evaluati on – ECGs and Evaluation of Left Ventricular 
Function 
ECG 
Vemurafenib is associated with concentration-dependent QTc prolongation (see Section 4.4.5).  Cobimetinib, as either monotherapy or in combination with vemurafenib, 
is not associated with QTc prolongation (see cob i 
metinib IB).  All patients who continue 
to receive vemurafenib will undergo ECG monitoring in accordance with the vemurafenib IB (e.g., at Day 15, monthly during the first 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter or more frequently if clinically indicated).  ECGs should be conducted per local standard of care.  Central ECG reading will no longer be conducted.  
For patients who have discontinued vemurafenib but are continuing treatment with 
cobimetinib  or placebo, ECG monitoring is not required unless clinically indicated. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 93 Evaluation of Left Ventricular Function 
There is a potential for MEKi, including cobimetinib, to result in reductions in LVEF 
(Flaherty et al. 2012 ). 
In the Phase III study (GO28141), with active surveillance, reductions 
in LVEF were 
reported more frequently in patients treated with vemurafenib  + cobimetinib   than 
vemurafenib  + placebo (6.7% vs. 2.9%).  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the cobimetinib IB for 
further details. 
All patients will undergo evaluation of LVEF, either by [CONTACT_422878]
y (ECHO) or 
multiple gated ejection acquisition scan (MUGA) at the following timepoints: 
• Screening 
• Cycle 2, Day 1 ± 1 week  
• On Day 1 of Cycles 5, 8, and 11 (every 3 treatment cycles) ± 2 weeks 
• On Day 1 of Cycles 15, 19, and 23 (every 4 treatment cycles) ± 2 weeks 
• On Day 1 of Cycles 29, 35, 41, 47, etc. (every 6 treatment cycles) ± 2 weeks 
• End-of-study-treatment visit  
 
Evaluation of LVEF does not need to be performed at end-of-study treatment visit if an 
evaluation has been performed within the last 12 weeks and there are no clinically significant findings and/or changes from base line.  Any patient who develops clinical 
signs or symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_843550]. 
Evaluation of LVEF must be performed by [CONTACT_843609].  It is 
strongly encouraged that the same laboratory and operator perform ECHO for each individual patient.  
Investigators must be aware of local institution regulations regarding repeat MUGA 
scans.  The repeat administration of radioisotopes is limited in some nuclear medicine laboratories and some patients in this study could require monitoring on 4 occasions or 
more. 
For patients who cross over from placebo to cobimetinib treatment, the ECHO/MUGA 
schedule must begin again, with exams at the following timepoints: 
• Within [ADDRESS_1172291] day of cross over 
• Start of second cycle after cross over, Day 1 ±
 1 week  
• On Day 1 of Cycles 5, 8, and 11 after cross over (every three treatment cycles)

[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Biomarker Assessments 
Patient specimens for dynamic (non-inherited) and genetic (inherited) biomarker 
discovery and validation will be collected from all patients participating in the trial.  These specimens will be used for research purposes to identify biomarkers that correlate with response/resistance or severity of adverse effects to combined BRAF and MEK inhibition.  This will help researchers to better understand the pathogenesis, course, and outcome of cutaneous melanoma and related diseases.  The biomarker analyses are listed below each objective.  Additional markers might be evaluated if further scientific evidence provides justification.  The details of the biomarker analysis will be specified in a separate Biomarker Analysis Plan. 
• Identify biomarkers of response and resistance in clinical specimens collected at 
pretreatment (archival and/or baseline), during treatment (Cycle 2 Day 15), and at 
the end-of-study treatment (disease progression). Biomarker analysis may include:  
o Mutation and copy number changes in RAF/RAS/MEK, other oncogenes, 
and tumor suppressor genes by [CONTACT_294811] 
o Levels of pErk, pS6, PTEN and RTKs, such as MET by 
[CONTACT_9064] 
o Infiltration of immune-cells, such as CD3/CD4/CD8 positive T-cells, in 
tumor environment by [CONTACT_843610] 
o Expression of BRAF, PDGFR, IGF1R, and other components of 
melanoma signaling pathways by [CONTACT_843611]  
• Identify potential biomarkers in blood to monitor for melanoma progression.  
Biomarker analysis may include: 
o Circulating DNA that harbors the V600 mutation of BRAF  
• Characterization of SCC (cutaneous and non-cutaneous), or other non-cuSCC new 
primary neoplasms and normal skin.  Analysis may include: 
o HRAS/KRAS/NRAS, BRAF, TP53 mutations as well as other tumor 
specific mutations 
o ERK phosphorylation and proliferation 
o Additional markers dependent on the type of lesion or if new scientific 
evidence warrants

Overview of the Roch e Clinical Repository 
The RCR is a centrally administered group of facilities for the long-term storage of 
human biologic specimens, including body flui ds, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof 
(e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The co llection and analysis of RCR specimens will 
facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 97 Samples for exploratory biomarker analyses from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research will be stored in the RCR.  These specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives: 
• To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or other 
effects associated with medicinal products 
• To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology 
• To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition 
• To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics for these assays

For all patients, date of consent should be recorded on the associated page of the eCRF.  
RCR specimens will be stored until completely depleted for up to 15 years after the final freeze of the respective clinical database unless regulatory authorities require that specimens be maintained for a longer period.  The RCR storage period will be in accordance with the IRB/EC-approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
Optional Samples for RCR 
The following samples will be used for identification of dynamic (non-inherited) biomarkers: 
• Remaining blood and plasma samples 
• Remaining FFPE or FF tissue (with the exception of archival FFPE blocks, which 
will be returned to the sites) for tumor protein expression or somatic tumor-related 
RNA/DNA analyses. 
 
The following sample will be used for identification of genetic (inherited) biomarkers: 
• One 6-mL whole blood sample (anticoagulated in K3-EDTA) at Cycle 1, Day [ADDRESS_1172296] to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure co nfidentiality, 
as described below. 
Confidentiality 
Given the sensitive nature of genetic data, [COMPANY_002] has implemented additional processes to ensure patient confidentiality for RCR specimens.  Upon receipt by [CONTACT_25736], each 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 98 specimen is "double-coded" by [CONTACT_3866] t he patient identification number with a new 
independent number.  Data generated from the us e of these specimens and all clinical 
data transferred from the clinical database and considered relevant are also labeled with 
this same independent number.  A "linking key" between the patient identification number and this new independent number is stored in a secure database system.  Access to the linking key is restricted to authorized individuals and is monitored by [CONTACT_25738].  Legitimate operational reasons for accessing the linking key are documented in a standard operating procedure.  Access to the linking key for any other reason requires written approval from the Pharma Repository Governance Committee and [COMPANY_002]'s Legal Department, as applicable. 
Data generated from RCR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
[CONTACT_25735], and [COMPANY_002] monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate. 
Patient medical information associated with RCR specimens is confidential and may only 
be disclosed to third parties as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Data derived from RCR specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The aggregate results of any research conducted using RCR specimens will be available in 
accordance with the effective [COMPANY_002] policy on study data publication. 
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know-how originating from 
the use of the RCR data will become and re main the exclusive and unburdened property 
of [COMPANY_002], except where agreed otherwise. 
Consent to Participate in the [COMPANY_002] Clinical Repository 
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation in the RCR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RCR.  Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the 15 year storage period.  A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_22862] a patient's agreement to provide RCR specimens.  Patients who decline to participate will check a “no” box in the appropriate section and will not provide a separate signature. 
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate by [CONTACT_26806]. 
In the event of an RCR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RCR research. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172297] inform the Medical Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes using the RCR Subject Withdrawal Form and, if the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RCR Research Sample Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the trial is closed.  A patient's withdrawal from Study GO28141 does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of specimens from long term storage in the RCR.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from long term storage in the RCR does not constitute withdrawal from Study GO28141. 
Monitoring and Oversight 
RCR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a quality-controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the Informed Consent Form.  [COMPANY_002] monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate parts of records relating to patient participation in the RCR for the purposes of verifying the data provided to [COMPANY_002].  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and health authority inspections by [CONTACT_25740]. 
In addition to an internal review body, an independent Science and Ethics Advisory 
Group, consisting of experts in the fields of biology, ethics, sociology, and law, will advise [COMPANY_002] regarding the use of RCR specimens and on the scientific and ethical aspects of handling genetic information.

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
Cobimetinib for use with vemurafenib is approved in the [LOCATION_002] , Canada,  
members of the European Union , and other countries.  The safety plan for patients in this 
study is based on clinical experience with cobimetinib in completed and ongoing studies.  
The anticipated important safety risks for cobi metinib are outlined below.  Please refer to 
the cobimetinib Investigator's Brochure for a complete summary of safety information.  
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients who participate in this 
study.  Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities.  Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events.  In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification, and treatment interruption or discontinuation,  are provided below.  There are management 
guidelines for specific toxicities of cobimetinib in Section 5.1.4.   
5.1.[ADDRESS_1172306] common laboratory abnormalities reported as adverse events included elevations of liver function tests (i.e., γ glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, 
AST, and bilirubin).   
The majority of adverse events reported in conjunction with Phase I through III clinical 
trials were of mild or moderate severity.  Approximately one-half of all patients treated with vemurafenib required interruption and/or reduction of dose on at least one occasion although treatment discontinuation due to adverse events has been rare. 
Approximately 20% of vemurafenib recipi[INVESTIGATOR_843556] (mainly ke ratoacanthoma type).  The majority of 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172307] 16 weeks of vemurafenib exposure and were not 
treatment limiting.  The risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma will be mitigated through the use of a Risk Management Plan as outlined in Section 5.1.3.  This plan has 
been utilized across a ll 
clinical studies of vemurafenib to date. 
Analysis of ECG data from the Phase II, NP22657 study of vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma patients (Genentech, data on file) revealed a risk of QT interval prolongation without associated clinical symptomatology. 
Two cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck have been reported in 
[ADDRESS_1172308] been reported in patients who received vemurafenib for >
 2 years. 
As of the second quarter of 2014, an adverse drug reaction of pancreatitis has been identified in patients being treated with vemurafenib.  Seventeen cases of pancreatitis with no strong risk factors or alternative explanations were reported.  Eight of the 17 cases were assessed as likely associated with vemurafenib use based on event onset latency and rechallenge/dechallenge information.  The clinical presentation, including mild to moderate severity, was consistent with the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_267475]-induced pancreatitis ( Lankisch and Gottesleben 1995 ).   
The Sponsor recommends that seru m amylase and lipase t
esting be conducted as part 
of the workup of any suspected case of pancreatitis in addition to other appropriate testing (e.g., computed tomography of the abdomen).  
An adverse drug reaction of acute kidney injury, including interstitial nephritis following 
vemurafenib administration, has been identified in patients being treated with vemurafenib.  The majority of these cases were characterized by [CONTACT_843589] (some observed in the setting of dehydration events) with recovery after dose modification.  Approximat ely 2% of acute kidney injury cases were 
biopsy−proven interstitial nephritis, and approximately 3% of acute kidney injury cases 
were acute tubular injury/necrosis.  No fatal cases were related to acute kidney injury.   
Renal function should be monitored in patients undergoing vemurafenib treatment.  
Vemurafenib dose modification guidelines should be utilized when applicable, and it is recommended to routinely monitor serum creatinine levels in all patients undergoing vemurafenib therapy.  
5.1.2 Risks Associated  with Cobimetinib  
Information related to risks attributed to c obimetinib is based on safety data from this 
Phase III Study GO28141 (cobimetinib plus vemurafenib), Phase Ib Study NO25395 (cobimetinib plus vemurafenib), and Phase I Study MEK4592g (cobimetinib 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 107 monotherapy).  For further information regarding clinical safety, please refer to the 
current cobimetinib Investigator’s Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Important Identified Risks Associat ed with Cobimetinib 
Hemorrhage 
Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with cobimeti nib.  In clinical studies with cobimetinib, 
events of cerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, reproductive tract hemorrhage, and hematuria, have been reported. 
In the Phase III study GO28141, Grade 1
−4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 13.0% 
of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and in 7.3% of patients treated 
with placebo plus vemurafenib.  The majority of hemorrhagic events were Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious.  Grade 3
−4 hemorrhage events were reported in 1.2% of patients who 
received cobimetinib plus vemurafenib and 0.8% of patients who received placebo plus vemurafenib. 
Caution should be used in patients with additional risk factors for bleeding, such as 
brain metastases, and/or in patients who us e concomitant medications that increase the 
risk of bleeding (including anti-platelet or anticoagulant therapy).  
Instructions and dose modifications for hemorrhage events are included in Table 10 , in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Serous Retinopathy 
Serous retinopathy (fluid accumulation within the layers of the retina) has been observed 
in patients treated with MEK-inhibitors, including cobimetinib ( Flaherty et al. 2012 ).  
Manifes t
ations of serous retinopathy include visual disturbances, findings of 
retinal detachment, and retinopathy.  Serous retinopathy events may also be asymptomatic. 
Serous retinopathy has been characterized in the Phase III Study GO28141.  The study 
incorporated prospective serial ophthalmic examinations for all enrolled patients.  Serous retinopathy was reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafeni b (25.5% vs. 2.8%, respectively), and 
approximately half the events were asymptomat ic Grade 1 events.  Few patients treated 
with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib experienced Grade
 ≥ 3 ocular events (2.8%); the 
majority of these were managed with dose modification of both cobimetinib and vemurafenib.  
To address serous retinopathy with cobimetinib treatment, all patients are required to 
undergo a baseline ophthalmologic examination to assess for history or evidence of retinal pathology that is considered to be a risk factor for or indicative of neurosensory retinal detachment, central serous chorioretinopathy, neovascular retinopathy, or 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 108 retinopathy of prematurity.  Patients will also undergo ophthalmologic examinations at

and subsequent ophthalmologic examinations are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  
Guidelines for management of patients who develop Grade  ≥ 2 visual disorders or 
retinopathy are provided in 
Table 10 in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
Decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline has been reported in patients receiving cobimetinib.  Left ventricular dy sfunction may occur with signs and symptoms 
of cardiac failure, or reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction events may be asymptomatic. 
Left ventricular dysfunction has been charac terized in the Phase III Study GO28141.  
The study incorporated prospective serial left ventricular ejection fraction evaluation in all 
patients.  With active surveillance, measured reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (26% vs. 19%, respectively, of Grade 2 or 3 decrease).  Of the patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, 2 patients (0.8%) had symptomatic reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and the remaining patients were asymptomatic.  Most left ventricular ejection fraction reduction events in patients on cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (62%) improved or resolved with management according to the dose-modification guidelines (see Table 10 in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Rhabdomyolysis and CPK Elevations 
Elevations in CPK have been observed in patients who received cobimetinib monotherapy as well as when administered with other agents.  The majority of CPK elevations reported were asymptomatic, non-serious, and resolved with or without study drug interruption.  One event of rhabdomyolysis was reported in the Phase III study GO28141 (cobimetinib pl us vemurafenib), and rhabdomyolysis has been reported 
in post-marketing experience.  
In Study GO28141, elevated CPK was reported as an adverse event more frequently in 
patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib (32.4% all grades, 11.3% Grade
 ≥ 3 
events) than placebo plus vemurafenib (8.1% all grades, 0% Grade  ≥ 3 events).   
CPK will be monitored at baseline and mont hly during treatment or as clinically 
indicated.  Instructions for dose modificatio ns for elevated CPK and rhabdomyolysis are 
included in Table 10  in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Photosensitivity (when Administered with Vemurafenib) 
No evidence of phototoxicity has been observed with cobimetinib as a single agent. 
However, photosensitivity was observed on Study GO28141 with a higher frequency in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm versus the placebo plus vemurafenib arm (46% vs. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 109 35%, respectively). The majority of events were Grades 1 or 2, with Grade ≥ 3 events 
occurring in 4% of patients in the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib arm versus 0% in the 
placebo plus vemurafenib arm.  Grade ≥  3 photosensitivity events in the cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib arm were treated with primary topi[INVESTIGATOR_843557].  Refer to Table 10 in Section [IP_ADDRESS] for photosensitivity 
management guideline s
.  
Pneumonitis 
Events of pneumonitis have been reported in cobimetinib clinical studies.  Most reported events were considered non-serious and of low-severity grade.  In the Phase III study GO28141, pneumonitis events were reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus  vemurafenib (1.6% vs. 0.4%, all grades).  
There were no reported Grade
 ≥ 3 events in either study arm.  Serious events were 
reported in 2 patients (0.8%) treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Risks Asso ciated with Cobimetinib 
Liver Laboratory Abnormalities and Severe Hepatotoxicity 
Liver laboratory test abnormalities, including increases in ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, have been reported as adverse events and serious adverse events in 
patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib. 
In the Phase III Study GO28141, liver laboratory test abnormalities reported as Grade
 ≥ 3 
adverse events occurred more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus 
vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (20.5% vs. 15.1%, respectively): 
Generally, elevations in liver laboratory tests were managed effectively with dose 
modification guidelines.  In both study arms, the majority of Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_1172309] been conducted with cobimetinib in animals, 
degenerative changes observed in reproductive tissues included increased apoptosis/necrosis of corpora lutea and seminal vesicle, epi[INVESTIGATOR_351820], and epi[INVESTIGATOR_40807].  These changes were reversible upon discontinuation of cobimetinib administration.  
Teratogenicity and Development Toxicity  
In a dedicated nonclinical embryo-fetal toxici ty study, cobimetinib produced fetal toxicity 
(resorptions and reductions in fetal weight), and teratogenicity (malformations of the great vessels and skull) at similar systemic  exposures in rat to those observed in 
patients administered the 60 mg dose.

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 110 [IP_ADDRESS] Other Risks Associ ated with Cobimetinib 
Rash 
In the Phase III study GO28141, combined rash events of all types and grades were 
reported more frequently in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib than placebo plus vemurafenib (71.7% vs. 66.7%, respectively), although Grade
 ≥ 3 events 
(approximately 16% of patients) and types of  rash reported were similar between study 
arms.  Specific events in patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib included rash (39% all grades, 5.9% Grade
 ≥ 3, 1.6% serious adverse events) and rash 
maculo-papular (14.6% all grades, 6.3% Grade  ≥ 3, 1.2% serious adverse events). 
Generally, Grade  ≥ 3 rash events were effectively managed with dose modification 
guidelines.  In GO28141, approximately 90% of Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_1172310] common adverse event 
reported.  Diarrhea events of all severity grades were reported in 59.9% of patients and 
Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 6.5% of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib versus 30.9% and 0.8%, respectively, in the patients treated with placebo plus vemurafenib.  No Grade [ADDRESS_1172311] been reported.  Serious adverse events of diarrhea were reported in 1.2% of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib. 
Nausea and vomiting have been reported in association with cobimetinib.  Most nausea 
and vomiting events were considered non-serious and low-severity grade. In the Phase III Study GO28141, nausea and vomiting events were reported more frequently in the active cobimetinib arm than the control arm (nausea 39.0% vs. 23.8%; vomiting 21.3% vs. 12.1%).  However, of patients treated with cobimetinib plus vemurafenib, few experienced Grade 3 events (nausea 0.8%, vomiting 1.2%). 
In the Phase I single-agent study (MEK4592g), all grades of nausea and vomiting were 
both reported as 33.9% with 0.9% reported for Grade
 ≥ 3 nausea and none reported for 
vomiting. 
The combination of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting has the potential to contribute to 
clinically significant volume depletion/dehydration from the combination of fluid losses with decreased oral intake.  In the majority of cases, diarrhea has been effectively managed with antidiarrheal agents and supportive care.  Routine antiemetic prophylaxis is not recommended.

Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172312] been few reports of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis in clinical trials with 
patients who have been exposed to cobimetini b monotherapy or cobimetinib when used 
with other agents.  These have appeared to be isolated reports, and in some cases, occurred in patients with histories of drug allergies.  Thus, the relationship of cobimetinib to these events is unclear. 
In the Phase III Study GO28141, Grade 3 hypersensitivity events were reported in 
3 patients in the cobimetinib and vemurafenib arm compared with no such events in the placebo plus vemurafenib arm.  All events required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_351821].

and/or cobimetinib should be dose reduced by 1 level, 
depending on which agent is implicated.  If visual symptoms of Grade ≥ 2 recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 2 dose level reductions of both 
vemurafenib and cobimetinib, and maximal supportive care, vemurafenib and cobimetinib should be permanently 
discontinued.  
 
E) Diarrhea Grade >3 a) No change in vemurafenib and cobimetinib dosing will be 
implemented for Grade ≤ 2 diarrhea; patients should receive 
maximal supportive care. 
b) If Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_422847], then both drugs should be held until the diarrhea has 
improved to Grade ≤ 1. 
• If this occurs within 28 days, vemurafenib and 
cobimetinib may be restarted with cobimetinib reduced 
by 1 dose level, with continued supportive care or 
prophylaxis. 
• If bowel movement characte ristics have NOT improved 
to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline with maximal supportive care 
by 28 days, then both drugs should be discontinued. 
d) If Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea recurs  despi[INVESTIGATOR_843565], vemurafenib and cobimetinib 
should be held until the diarrhea resolves to Grade ≤ 1.  If this 
occurs within 28 days, then therapy may be re-initiated with vemurafenib reduced by 1 dose level.  The cobimetinib dose 
will be maintained at the previously reduced dose. 
e) If the diarrhea recurs at Grade ≥
 3 despi[INVESTIGATOR_843566] 2 dose levels in both drugs (i.e., 
vemurafenib to 480 mg BID and cobimetinib to 20 mg QD), 
then both drugs should be per manently discontinued. 
F) Rhabdomyolysis or CPK 
elevations  Rhabdomyolysis or symptomatic CPK elevations:  Interrupt 
cobimetinib treatment.  If severity is improved by [CONTACT_843617] 4 weeks, restart cobimetinib at a dose reduced by 20 mg, if clinically indicated.  Vemurafenib dosing can be continued when cobimetinib treatment is modified, if clinically indicated. 
If rhabdomyolysis or symptomatic CPK elevation do not 
improve within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue cobimetinib treatment. 
Asymptomatic CPK elevations:   Grade
 ≤ 3:  cobimetinib dosing does  not need to modified or 
interrupted to manage asymptomatic Grade  ≤ 3 CPK 
elevations.   Grade 4:  Interrupt cobimetinib treatment.  If improved to

Adverse Event Action 
Grade  ≤ 3 within 4 weeks, restart cobimetinib at a dose 
reduced by 20 mg, if clinically indicated.  Vemurafenib 
dosing can be continued when cobimetinib treatment is modified, if clinically indicated.  If CPK elevations do not improve to Grade
 ≤ 3 within 4 weeks following dose 
interruption, permanently discontinue cobimetinib treatment. 
G) LFT elevations a) If Grade ≤ 2, continue current dose of vemurafenib and 
cobimetinib.  
b) If Grade 3, hold vemurafenib.  Continue current dose of 
cobimetinib. Upon resolution of LFT to Grade ≤ 1, resume 
vemurafenib at 1 lower dose level (e.g., 960 mg to 720 mg, or 
720 mg to 480 mg).  
c) If Grade 4, see Section J below. d) No dose modification is required for isolated  GGT elevation 
in the absence of clinically si gnificant elevation above baseline 
grade in AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin or hepatic. 
H) QTcF interval prolongation 
on ECG Grade ≥ 3 
 a) Rule out other risk factors for arrhythmia (e.g., myocardial ischemia); check for electrol yte disturbances (particularly 
potassium and magnesium levels) in all cases. 
b) Evaluate concomitant medicati ons to determine if there is 
co-administration of drugs that prolongs QTc interval in all 
cases (e.g., 5-HT
[ADDRESS_1172322] anti-emetics; see 
Appendix 9 ). 
c) Interrup t dosin
g of vemurafenib ECG monitoring should be 
performed until QTc interval decreases below 500 ms. Electrolytes abnormalities should be corrected in all cases.  
Continue dosing with cobimetinib at the current dose if 
otherwise tolerated. 
d) Plan to seek a cardiologist consultation or advice. e) If QTc interval does not improve within 28 days after 
interruption of vemurafenib dosing, permanently discontinue 
vemurafenib; continue dosing with cobimetinib at the current 
dose. 
f) If QTc improves within 28 days, restart dosing of 
vemurafenib at 1 reduced dose level.  
g) Repeat 12-lead ECG monitoring at 2 weeks and 4 weeks of 
restarting vemurafenib at the lower dose.  Additional ECG 
monitoring will be performed at Day 15 of each subsequent Cycle
 for  3 cycles, and every 3 months thereafter.  
h) If second increase in QTc interval to > 500 ms occurs at the 
lower dose of vemurafenib, follow guidelines above, and reduce dose of   vemurafenib by [CONTACT_625364]. 
i) Permanently discontinue vemurafenib if after correction of 
associated risk factors and dose reductions, the QTc increase 
meets values of both >
 500 ms and > 60 ms change from pre-
treatment values.

• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition  (
e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to [COMPANY_002])  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Any non-cutaneous primary malignancy (related or unrelated to study treatment) 
that develop during or up to [ADDRESS_1172326] be reported as a serious adverse event 
• Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death).  This does not include any adverse event that 
had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have 
caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Results in p ersistent or 
significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)

clearly consistent with the suspected progression of the underlying cancer as defined by, or other criteria as determined by [CONTACT_990]; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_229856] a serious adverse event. 
• Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as adverse events if the 
symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to the progression of the 
underlying malignancy or does not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease under study. 
• If there is any uncertainty about an adverse event being due only to the extent of the 
disease under study, it should be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event. 
 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as se
vere headache without any further findings). 
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_093]/site to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1172327] (Immediately Reportable to 
[COMPANY_002])  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).   
Adverse events of special interest fo r this study include the f
ollowing: 
• Any retinal vein occlusion  
• Any retinal detachment, retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_422854], neurosensory retinal 
detachment or central serous chorioretinopathy  
• Grade  ≥ 3 photosensitivity 
• Grade  ≥ 3 rash 
• Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_1172328] in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice, as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
• Grade ≥ 3 QT interval prolongation

• Any cutaneous primary malignancy, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 
keratoacanthoma (KA), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), new primary melanoma. 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below 
Any organism, virus, or infectious part icle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only  
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
 
The occurrence of any cutaneous primary malignancy, including SCC, KA, BCC, new 
primary melanoma will be considered a Grade 3 adverse event in this study.  Any non− cutaneous primary malignancy will be reported as a serious adverse event (see 
Section 5.2.2).

ion and in Sections 5.4−5.6.  For each 
adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment
 of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for serious criteria), severity (see Section 
5.3.3), and causality (see Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_1172330].  All adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention should be reported 
(e.g., serious adverse events related to invasive procedures such as biopsies). 
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study 
drug, will be reported until [ADDRESS_1172331] dose of study drug.  After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious adverse events (including new primary cancers), or other adverse events of concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study drug (see Section 5.6).    
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 128 5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?”  
 
Adverse event reports will not be derived fr om PRO data by [CONTACT_1034], and safety 
analyses will not be performed using PRO data.  However, if any PRO responses 
suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO data, 
the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will document the event in the pat ient’s source document and report the event 
on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 11 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif
ically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

Grade Severity 
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 129 5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration: 
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (where applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non-treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1172333] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently establishe d, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 130 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  However, medically significant adverse events occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe GI hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by a mild, non-serious infection, only neutropenia 
should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by a severe or serious infection, both events should 
be reported separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens.  If the event becomes serious, the Adverse Event eCRF should be updated to reflect this. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values and ECG Findings  
Not every laboratory or ECG abnormality qualif ies as an adverse event.  A laboratory 
test result should be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 131 • Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in  deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a manifestation of a disease or 
syndrome (e.g.,  ALP and bilirubin 5  × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a manifestation of a clearly 
discernible disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result should be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 132 changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or 
seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin) 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1172334] (see Section 5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol−specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1) that are attributed 
by [CONTACT_843618]/Early Discontinuation eCRF and do not need to be reported on the Adverse Events eCRF.  All other on-study deaths, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). An independent monitoring committee will monitor the 
frequency of deaths from all causes. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distin ct event.  The event or condit 
ion 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  
The term “sudden death”  should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and 
unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without 
preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_1172335] seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death”  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of 
death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].

[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-Existing Medical Conditions 
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Associated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration 
Study drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount higher 
than the dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study drug is not an adverse event unless it results in untoward medical effects.  Any study drug overdose 
or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on the Study Drug Administration eCRF.   
All adverse events associated with an overdos e or incorrect administration of study drug 
should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills

6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
6.1.1 Progression-Free Survival  
The type 1 error (α ) for the analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS is 0.05 (2-sided).   
Approximately [ADDRESS_1172351] occurred.  Statistical considerations are based on the following assumptions: 
• Stratified log-rank test at 0.05 significance level (2-sided) 
• 6 months median PFS for the vemurafenib
 + placebo arm 
• 11 months median PFS for the vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm 
• Accrual ramp-up time of 9 months to reach 65 patients per month thereafter for a 
total enrollment period of approximate 14 months 
• 5% dropout rate 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 139 • No interim analysis of PFS 
 
A total of 206 PFS events provides > 95% power to detect an improvement in median 
PFS from 6 months in the vemurafenib  + placebo arm to 11 months in the 
vemurafenib + cobimetinib arm (corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.55, and the minimal 
detectable difference [MDD] is 0.76).   
6.1.2 Overall Survival  
See Section 6.9.2 for a description of the planned interim analysis and final analysis of 
OS.  The type 1 error ( α) for the analysis of the secondary endpoint of OS is 
0.05 (2-sided).   
The final analysis of OS will be performed after the occurren
ce of approximately 
250 deaths.  A total of 250 deaths provides approximately 80% power to detect an 
improvement in median OS from 15 months in the vemurafenib  + placebo arm to 
21.4 months in the vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm (corresponding to a hazard ratio for 
death of 0.70) at an overall 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1172352] OF STUDY

6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic variables, stratification factors, and other baseline and disease characteristics (including disease stage and LDH) will be summarized. 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
Unless otherwise noted, all efficacy analyses will include all randomized patients (intent-to-treat analysis), and patients will be grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.

The statistical hypothesis of this study is as follows: 
H0: PFS (Arm A)  = PFS (Arm B)  
H1: PFS (Arm A) ≠ PFS (Arm B) 
 
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 140 where PFS (Arm A)  represents the survival function of PFS in the vemurafenib  + placebo  
arm and PFS (Arm B)  represents the survival function of PFS in the 
vemurafenib  + cobimetinib arm. 
PFS as assessed by [CONTACT_843619].  PFS is defined 
as the time between date of randomization and the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.  Disease progression will be determined based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1.  Data from patients who have not experienced disease progression or death will be censored at the last tumor assessment date.  Data from patients with no post-baseline tumor assessment will be censored at the randomization date.  The hazard ratio for PFS will be estimated using a stratified Cox model.  Two-sided 95% CIs for the hazard ratio will be provided.  The stratified analyses will incorporate 2 stratification factors:  geographic region (North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand/others) and metastatic classification (unresectable Stage IIIc, M1a, and M1b; M1c).  Results from an unstratified log-rank test and the unstratified hazard ratio will also be presented.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm, and the Kaplan-Meier curves will be provided.

Confirmation of response (partial response or complete response) will be done no earlier than [ADDRESS_1172355] with Schouten correction, and a 95% Hauck-Anderson CI will be calculated for the difference in BORRs between treatment groups.  In addition, a 95% Clopper-Pearson CI will be calculated for the BORR.  
DOR is defined as the interval between the date of the earliest qualifying response and 
the date of progressive disease or death for any cause.  This will be calculated only for patients who had a confirmed overall response of CR or PR.  Median duration of response will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the 95% CI will be calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley ( 1982 ). Since the

In addition, exposure to study treatment (vemurafenib, cobimetinib, placebo), including 
cumulative dose and treatment duration, will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].  Selected laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_267579] (NCI CTCAE v4.0). 
6.[ADDRESS_1172358] modeling will be used for the estimation of pop PK parameters for cobimetinib and vemurafenib.  Covariates such as patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, body size), total protein, serum albumin, liver function tests (e.g., AST, ALT, ALP), and serum creatinine will be tested for significance on PK parameters of interest.  The PK data in this study might be pooled with PK data from other studies.  
The PK data will be combined with the safety (e.g., QTc) and efficacy (e.g., PFS) data 
for exposure −response modeling as data permit.  PK and PK

Repeated measures mixed-effects models will be the primary models for the formal 
comparison of the QLQ-C30 multiple-item subscale scores between treatment arms.  
Each model will have a term for intercept, a term for a linear time trend term (in weeks), a term for treatment group, and a term for treatment-by-time interaction.  Repeated measures over time will be accounted for by [CONTACT_843622] (using the REPEATED statement in SAS

6.9 INTERIM ANALYSES 
6.9.1 Interim Efficacy Anal yses of Primary Endpoint  
No interim analyses of the primary endpoint (PFS) will be performed. 
6.9.2 Analysis of Overall Survival  
The OS analyses plan for this study protocol (v5) and the statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
have been revised.  The study will incorporate 2 OS analyses (1 interim and 1 final analysis).  The first OS interim analysis was performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis ([ADDRESS_1172360] patient was randomized).  The originally planned final analysis for OS at 385 events is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2017.  The rapid development of other potentially effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_843569], which may potentially confound the OS benefit of vemurafenib
 + cobimetinib in future OS 
analyses. Therefore, in order to minimize this potential impact while maintaining a statistically robust evaluation of the OS benefit associated with the combination, the protocol-defined OS analyses have been revised.   
 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 143 The revised plan for OS analyses is to perform  the final OS analysis at approximately 
250 deaths without further interim analyses.  The type 1 error rate would be strictly 
controlled at the 0.05 level by [CONTACT_843584]-DeMets implementation of the O’Brien-Fleming use function as pre-specified in the original protocol and SAP.  
The final OS analysis will be performed after the occurrence of approximately 
250 deaths (projected to occur at approximately [ADDRESS_1172361] patient was randomized).  The Lan-DeMets implementation of the O’Brien and Fleming use function will be used to control the overall type I error for the OS comparison at a 2-sided, 0.05 significance level.

7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6. 
To facilitate source data 
verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor or designee direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756]. 
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in

is considered by [CONTACT_843626]’s best interest. 
3. Physical exam will be performed during screening and subsequent ly at each study visit.  After initial screening physical exa m, a 
symptom-directed exam that contains an evaluation of the oral cavity, oropharynx, neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, and skin, will b e performed.  
Patients will be asked about skin and vision changes at each symptom-directed physical exam.  Assessments must  be done before study drug 
dosing, where applicable.  Note:  If vital signs and physical ex amination are assessed within [ADDRESS_1172381] in  a seated position.  Height will be collected only at screenin g/baseline.  
3A Visual inspection of the anus and digital examination of the anal canal will be performed at screening, thereafter per local  standard of care for 
vemurafenib-treated patients, and at other times as clinically i ndicated to monitor for SCC. Colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or ano scopy is not 
required but may be performed if clinically indicated. All female  patients will undergo pelvic examination including visual ins pection of the uterine 
cervix and Pap smear at screening, thereafter per local standard of care, and at other times as clinically indicated to monitor  for cervical 
carcinoma. 
4. Following approval of v5 of the protocol, QoL assessments will no longer be conducted.

MEASURABILITY OF TUMOR AT BASELINE  
DEFINITIONS  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or 
non-measurable as follows:  
MEASURABLE TUMOR LESIONS 
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10 mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater 
than 5 mm).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_74321] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_1172397] X-ray.  
• Malignant lymph nodes:  To be consider ed pathologically enlarged and measurable, 
a lymph node must be ≥
 [ADDRESS_1172398] scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in 
follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  See also section 
below on ‘Baseline documentation of target and non-target lesions’ for information on lymph node measurement.  
 
NON-MEASURABLE TUMOR LESIONS 
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <  15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, in ﬂammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identi ﬁed by [CONTACT_843628].

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 165 Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions prev iously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment:  
Bone lesions: 
• Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan or X-rays are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques 
can be used to con ﬁrm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identi ﬁable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_47333], such as 
CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the de ﬁnition of measurability described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.  
 
Cystic lesions: 
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically de ﬁned simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since 
they are, by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] ﬁnition, simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the de ﬁnition of measurability described above.  
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to 
other loco-regional therapy, are usually not  considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
 
SPECIFICATIONS BY [CONTACT_843629], using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
METHOD OF ASSESSMENT  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identi ﬁed and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  
Imaging-based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Appendix 3 New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors –  
Version 1.1 (cont.) 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 166 Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions wi ll only be considered measurable when they are 
super ﬁcial and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules).    As 
noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at 
the end of the study.  
Chest X-ray:  Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly de ﬁned and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  Still, non-contrast CT is preferred over 
chest X-ray. 
CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has de ﬁned measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1172399] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans). 
If prior to enrolment it is known that a patient is not able to undergo CT scans with 
intravenous (IV) contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT or MRI (with or without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at baseline and follow-up, should be guided by [CONTACT_234632].  For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) will be performed, should also be based on the tumor type, anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized to allow for comparison to the prior studies if possible.  Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, 
the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward.  
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identi ﬁed by [CONTACT_460195], con ﬁrmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about 
radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.   
Endoscopy, laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, they can be useful to conﬁ rm complete pathological

Protocol GO28141, Version 8 167 response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
response.  If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.  Because tumor markers are disease speci ﬁc, instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into 
protocols on a disease speci ﬁc basis.  Speci ﬁc guidelines for both CA-125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_1172400]-line trials in ovarian cancer. 
Cytology, histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g., with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological con ﬁrmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.  
TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION  
ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL TUMOR BURDEN AND MEASURABLE 
DISEASE  
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  Only patients with measur able disease at baseline should be included 
in protocols where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint.  Measurable disease is de ﬁned by [CONTACT_12155] (as detailed above 
in the section titled “Measurable Tumors at Ba seline”).  In studies where the primary 
endpoint is tumor progression (either time to progression or proportion with progression at a ﬁ xed date), the protocol must specify if entry is restricted to those with measurable 
disease or whether patients having non-measurable disease only are also eligible.  
Baseline Documentation of ‘Tar get’ and ‘Non-Target’ Lesions  
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of ﬁve lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identiﬁ ed as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline. 
Appendix 3 New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors –  
Version 1.1 (cont.) 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172401] only one or two organ sites involved a 
maximum of two (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions in that organ will be recorded as non-measurable  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they  are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by [CONTACT_33490].  Pathological nodes which are 
deﬁned as measurable and may be identi ﬁed as target lesions must meet the criterion of 
a short axis of ≥
 [ADDRESS_1172402] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the s hort axis.  For example, an abdominal node, 
which is reported as being 20 mm
 × 30 mm, has a short axis of 20 mm and quali ﬁes as a 
malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥
 10 mm but <  15 mm) 
should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identi ﬁed as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression.’  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case report form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).

Version 1.1 (cont.) 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 169 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
This section provides the deﬁ nitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.  
EVALUATION OF TARGET LESIONS  
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target ) must have reduction in short axis 
to <  10 mm. 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.) 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
Special Notes on the Asses sment of Target Lesions  
Lymph nodes:  Lymph nodes identi ﬁed as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means 
that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is deﬁ ned as 
having a short axis of <
 10 mm.  Case report forms (CRFs) or other data collection 
methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate section where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a short axis <
 10 mm.  
For PR, SD, and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’:  while on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’.  When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF: 
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
Appendix 3 New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors –  
Version 1.1 (cont.) 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 170 • If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and BML (below measurable limit) should 
be ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a de ﬁnable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by 
[CONTACT_12156]; howev er, if a lymph node is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well and BML should also be ticked).  
 
This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_1172403] slice thickness (but should not be 
changed with varying CT slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error. 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that 
should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm and in that case BML should not be ticked. (BML is equivalent to a less than sign <.) 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: when non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, 
the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
EVALUATION OF NON-TARGET LESIONS  
This section provides the deﬁ nitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response 
for the group of non-target lesions.  While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints speci ﬁed in the protocol.  
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in 
size (<
 10 mm short axis). 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. 
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.)

Version 1.1 (cont.) 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 171 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease  
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as 
follows:  
• When the patient also has measurable disease:  in this setting, to achieve 
‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, 
even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on 
the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
• When the patient has only non-measurable disease:  this circumstance arises in 
some Phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease.  The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this 
instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in non-
target disease cannot be easily quanti ﬁed (by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] ﬁnition:  if all lesions are truly non-
measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden 
based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the 
increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease:  i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ 
(which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion).  Examples 
include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols 
as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’.  If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, 
the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the 
very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore the increase 
must be substantial.  
 
NEW LESIONS  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no speci ﬁc criteria for 
the identiﬁ cation of new radiographic lesions; however, the ﬁnding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or ﬁndings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or ﬂare of pre-existing 
lesions).  
Appendix 3 New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors –  
Version 1.1 (cont.) 
Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version 8 172 This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or 
complete response.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identi ﬁed on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example 
of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a brain CT or MRI ordered which reveals metastases.  The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/ she did not have brain imaging at baseline 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans con ﬁrm 
there is deﬁ nitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.  
EVALUATION OF BEST OVERALL RESPONSE  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for con ﬁrmation.  
On occasion a response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if post-treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of best overall response.  Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression will affect best response designation.  
The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the ﬁndings of both target 
and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new 
lesions.  
Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may 
also require con ﬁrmatory measurement.  Speci ﬁcally, in non-randomized trials where 
response is the primary endpoint, con ﬁrmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either 
one the ‘best overall response’.  Thi s is described further below.  
Timepoint Response  
It is assumed that at each protocol speci ﬁed timepoint, a response assessment occurs.

MISSING ASSESSMENTS AND NO T-EVALUABLE DESIGNATION  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.

Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib ⎯F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd   
Protocol GO28141, Version [ADDRESS_1172406] achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.  
If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done, 
or could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the Response for Target Lesions should be “Unable to Assess” since the patient is not evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are indicated as ‘not assessed’, the response for non-target lesions should be “Unable to Assess” (except where there is clear progression).  Overall response would be “Unable to Assess” if either the target response or the non-target response is “Unable to Assess” (except where this is clear evidence of progression) as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that timepoint. 
BEST OVERALL RESPONSE: ALL TIMEPOINTS

• Is fatal; [results in death] [NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event] 
• Is life-threatening [NOTE: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the 
patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe].

• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the 
outcomes listed above 
  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting to the Sponsor is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569126]. These situations should also usually be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An unexpected AE is one, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 
applicable product information. 
Causality is initially assessed by [CONTACT_3170]. For Serious Adverse Events, possible 
causes of the event are indicated by [CONTACT_569163].  (Check all that apply)

The term severe is a measure of intensity, thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious. 
For example, nausea of several hours' duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.

Class  
I No limitation:  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, 
dyspnea, or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332]. 
II Slight limitation of physical activity:  Such patients are comfortable at rest.  
Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspnea, or 
angina. 
III Marked limitation of physical activity:  Although patients are comfortable at 
rest, less than ordinary physical  activity will lead to symptoms. 
IV Inability to carry on physical activity  without discomfort:  Symptoms of 
congestive heart failure are present even at rest.  With any physical activity, increased discomfort is experienced.

Information 
The cobas® [ADDRESS_1172410] is a real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) test intended to be used to identify melanoma patients whose tumors carry the 
BRAFV600 mutation for treatment with vemurafenib monotherapy. Its primary use is the 
detection of the BRAFV600 mutation in DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded human melanoma and colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor tissue. 
A prototype version of this test, designed to run on the cobas® TaqMan® [ADDRESS_1172411] melanoma and CRC patients for the Phase I extension cohorts. 
The cobas® 4800 System uses the same technology as that used in the cobas® 
TaqMan® [ADDRESS_1172412] been conducted to characterize the cobas® 
4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Assay for analytical sensitivity, limits of sample input, accuracy and reproducibility for detection of the BRAF
V600 mutation in DNA from 
melanoma.  Based upon these studies, the cobas® [ADDRESS_1172413] adult patients with metastatic melanoma for treatment with vemurafenib in the Phase II and Phase III clinical trials of vemurafenib in locally-advanced/unresectable or metastatic melanoma (Investigational Device Exemption G070126). 
Based on preliminary findings that the BRAF mutation is preserved in patients with 
tumors that escape vemurafenib-mediated suppression of the RAS/RAF pathways, BRAF mutation status will be confirmed retrospectively by [CONTACT_267515]
® [ADDRESS_1172414] for the mutation will be eligible for treatment in the clinical 
drug trial if they meet other eligibility criteria.

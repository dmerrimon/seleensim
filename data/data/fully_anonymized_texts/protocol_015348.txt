2.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims , or objectives.  
Purpose: The purpose of this research is to develop a midlife Black women’s Stress-reduction WELL ness 
intervention, B-SWELL , to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors based on the stressors and t hemes identified  
in the PI’s preliminary research and consistent with the American Heart Association’s Life Simple 7 Success 
Plan (LS7) behaviors . 
  
Aim 1: Develop the B -SWELL intervention for midlife Black women through the innovative leveraging  
of CBPR methodology and LS7 modifiable healthy lifestyle behaviors.  
a) To develop components of the B -SWELL intervention prototype for midlife Black women.  
b) Obtain  ratings of the new components of the B -SWELL from an expert panel consisting of four   
    midlife Black women laypersons, three researchers  and three integrative health care specialists  for    
    degree of  accuracy, relevance, and feasibility to inform further refinements.  
Aim 2 : Determine the feasibility of the B -SWELL intervention with a trial of 50 midlife Black women 
randomized to the B -SWELL intervention (25) or to a wellness education (WE) control group (25) : 
a) Obtain recruitment, retention, treatment fidelity ratings, and satisfaction ratings for the intervention  
                 procedures for both groups , including technology ; 
b) Compare mediator measures (stress, self -efficacy) for participants in the  B-SWEL L intervention     
    group with those in the WE group at 8 and 12 weeks.  
c) Compare outcome measures (LS7 summary scores, unhealthy days, general health, depressive  
    symptoms) for participants in the B -SWELL intervention group with those in the WE att ention  
    control group at 8 and 12 weeks.  
 
2.2 State the hypotheses to be tested.  
Our hypothesis proposes that B -SWELL (intervention) participants will show improved self -efficacy in  
managing life stress and adopting the LS7 behaviors, compared to a n attention  control group (WE group)  
receiving traditional  wellness education.  
 
3.0 Background * 
3.1 Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge.  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of death in all women, and as women transition 
through midlife, the prevalence of CVD exceeds that of men. (American Hear t Association, 2016)  Midlife Black 
women, defined as ages 40 -64, unduly shoulder the burden of CVD (49%), hypertension (40%), and heart 
failure (50% greater risk). (Go et al., 2013; Gudmundsdottir, Hoieggen, Stenehjem, Waldum, & Os, 2012)  
Midlife Black women also report higher levels of chronic stress and greater numbers of stressful life events in 
comparison to mid life White women, (Schulz et al., 2000; Turner & Avison, 2003)  putting them at greater risk 
for CVD. In addition to the physical impact, copi[INVESTIGATOR_286451] -
care, functioning as a barrier to the adoption of healthy lifestyle beh aviors. (Pedersen, von Kanel, Tully, & 
Denollet, 2017; Pogoso va et al., 2015)  Existent interventions do not fully address the unique factors 
contributing to the experience of stress, lifestyle behaviors, and CVD risk in midlife Black women.  
In the PI’s prior research, we identified the particularities of stress and how they manifest in the lives of 
midlife Black women. Key stressors included: workplace str ess, parenting, finances, and media stress. (Jones, 
Sternberg, Janson, & Lee, 2016; H. J. Jones, Norwood, & Bankston, 2018)  The theme, ‘Strong Black Woman’, 
was identified al ong with the subthemes of ‘gendered racism and discrimination’ and ‘life balance’. (H. J. Jones 
et al., 2018)  The Strong Black Woman persona explains the elevated risk for morbidity and persistent chronic 
stress in Black women due to simultaneous exposures to racism and sexism and the gendered expectations of 
being the primary familial care -giver and  supporter of others and the community alike. (Mullings, 2000; Woods -
 Page 5 of 29 Revis ed: January 11, 2019  Giscombe, Lobel, Zimmer, Wiley Cene, & Corbie -Smith, 2015)  This persona serves as a copi[INVESTIGATOR_286452], cultivating strength and resilience among Black women, but leads to a 
deterioration of health due to chronic active copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. (Geronimus, 2001; Lekan, 2009)  
Many Black women internalize characteristics of the ‘Strong Black W oman’ and while these 
characteristics are generally positive, it is easy to envision how a ‘Strong Black Woman’ can become stressed, 
overwhelmed, and isolated. (Beauboeuf -Lafontant, 2009)  Much research has been done to provide a voice and 
understanding to the Black female experience in America however, none have used that voice to identify and 
target the unique perceived stressors that may serve as barriers to the adoption of healthy lifestyle  behaviors. 
The purpose of this research proposal is to develop a midlife Black women’s Stress-reduction WELL ness 
intervention, B-SWELL , to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors based on the stressors and themes identified in 
preliminary research. (Jones et al., 2016; H. J. Jones et al., 2018)  Community -based participatory research 
(CBPR) methods will be used to engage the community and include midlife Black women in the development 
of the B -SWELL. We propose that the skills and knowledge gained through participation in the B -SWELL 
program will increase receptivity to the healthy lifestyle behaviors outlined in the American Heart Association’s 
Life Simple 7 Success Plan (LS7). The LS7 targets seven risk factors known to  increase cardiovascular related 
health risk: cholesterol, fasting glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, physical activity, diet, and 
smoking. (Windham et al., 2017)  By [CONTACT_14898] 40, the prevalence of CVD is equal between men and women but 
by [CONTACT_14898] 60, more women are affected. (Mozaffarian et al., 2016)  This noted increased risk of CVD across 
midlife warrants the need for intervention.  
  
3.2 Describe any  relevant preliminary data.  
 
Two preliminary studies conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_286453]. (Jones et al., 2016; H. J. Jones et 
al., 2018)  These studies sought to understand the complexity of stress as a health indicator for midlife Black 
women. The first study used mixed methods to assess changes in perceived stress across midlife and identify 
significant life stressors. (Jones et al., 2016)  The sample of 15 midlife Black women from the San Fra ncisco Bay 
area (mean age 61years) had high -perceived stress scores that persisted across midlife. Although stress scores 
were consistent over time (between ages 40 and 60), the sources of stress changed. Significant life stressors 
included finances, carin g for family members, relationships, personal health and aging, race and gender -based 
discrimination, and raising children. (Jones et al., 2 016) 
“Race is the hidden in plain view stressor in [LOCATION_003] life. I am Black and that has caused me stress working 
in a White world. Equal, or perhaps worse, is the fight to hav e my voice heard as a woman.”  
 
This sample of midlife Black women was part of a larger cohort of Black and White midlife women. In 
the cohort (N=39), midlife Black women had higher perceived stress scores, a greater number of depressive 
symptoms and, were more likely to be obese and have elevated blood pressures compared to White women of 
similar age and de mographics. (Jones et al., 2016)  Higher perceived stress scores correlated with older 
biological age, indicating a greater health risk profile;19 a finding that is consistent with the literature.  
The second study conducted by [CONTACT_978] (H. J. Jone s et al., 2018)  used community engagement and focus 
groups to identify stress -related themes in the lives of midlife Black women residing in the Greater Cincinnati 
area. Key stressors were identified within six major themes: workplace, parenting, financ es, social media, 
gendered racism and discrimination, and life imbalance (H. J. Jones et al., 2018) . The participants also identified 
stress -reduction strategies and barriers to adopting those strategies. The six themes highlighting key life 
stressors in this second study were similar to those reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_286454]. (Jones et al., 2016)  Two 
new sources of stress also emerged: social media and life imbalance. (H. J. Jones et al., 2018)  Stress -reduction 
strategies were also similar bet ween the two studies and included exercise, prayer, hobbies and other self -care 
activities, and fellowship. (H. J. Jones et al., 2018)  The ‘Strong Black Woman’ theme was prevalent in the 
Cincinnati cohort:  
 “...we fail to seek assistance...sometimes you have to step back and recognize you might be a little bit in 
over your head and you need some hel p” 
 Page 6 of 29 Revis ed: January 11, 2019   
The focus group discussions in this second study generated ideas for the content (i.e., finances, 
parenting) and delivery (i.e., lectures, demonstrations) of a culturally tailored stress reduction program. The 
women also recommended the use of technology (social media, websites) for continued access to information 
and support. A manuscript authored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_286455] B -SWELL intervention is under peer review.  
The findings fo r these preliminary studies are notable for their similarities. Midlife Black women in the 
San Francisco Bay area shared similar experiences with stress and sources of stress with midlife Black women 
from the Midwest. (Jones et al., 2016; H. J. Jones et al., 2018)  Furthermore, the women reported similarities in 
preferred copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]. (Jones et al., 2016; H. J. Jones et al., 2018)  The stress reduction strategies reported  
reflect culturally acceptable approaches for midlife Black women. This preliminary research underscores the 
importance of using the voices of midlife Black women to inform the design of interventions intended to 
improve behavior. CBPR methodology will fac ilitate the collaboration between the research team and the 
targeted population. This proposed research aims to fill that gap in the current intervention literature; themes 
identified in the PI’s preliminary research (Jones et al., 2016; H. J. Jones et al., 2018)  will inform the 
development of a stress -reduction wellness program for midlife Black women, B -SWELL. This project has the 
potential to improve our knowledge about the complex relationship between stress and  behavior while 
decreasing CVD risk in a high -risk population.  
The work of the mentoring team is essential to the success of this research. The primary mentor, [CONTACT_286512], has a body of research that focuses on the care of the family caregiver. She  developed the 
Telephone Assessment and Skill -building Kit (TASK) for stroke family caregivers through a K01 Award, then 
tested efficacy of this innovative program (TASK II) through an R01 -funded randomized controlled clinical 
trial (RCT). (Bakas et al., 2015; Bakas et al., 2009)  She has a currently funded R21 designed to optimize the 
TASK III program  using technology (i.e., Task III website and eBook) and goal setting strategies to further 
improve caregiver health. [CONTACT_286513] has invited the PI [INVESTIGATOR_286456] R21 research team where she will take an 
active role in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_286457].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_286458] a member of [CONTACT_286514]’ research team (i.e., intervention development, clinical trial management, use of technology for 
intervention delivery). Many midlife Black women serve in caregiving roles, making her involvement  in [CONTACT_286514]’ research highly relevant to the current project.  
[CONTACT_286515] has a body of research grounded in CBPR and the health of under -represented 
communities.[ADDRESS_349302] identified i n this study and 
has a currently funded NIH R25 SEPA grant. Her expertise in epi[INVESTIGATOR_286459], as she understands the intersectionality of environment, person, and health; stress -related illness; and

3.[ADDRESS_349303] life expectancy of all racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. by  
2060. This lower life expectancy projection is attributed to health problems that occur across the life span but  
in midlife Black women (ages 40 -64), is commonly attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is estimate d 
that 49% of adult black women have heart disease and over 40% have been diagnosed with hypertension.[ADDRESS_349304] incidence of heart failure30 and 64% of Black women do not know that heart  
disease is their greatest health risk.1 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_100368], studies show that interventi on in midlife  
can aide in the prevention of chronic conditions like CVD and increase life expectancy.31,32  
Midlife Black women are exposed to multiple and competing daily stressors resulting from role changes,  
major life events, and menopause, in addition to microaggressions and discriminatory acts related to their age,  
 Page 7 of 29 Revis ed: January 11, 2019  gender, and ethnicity. The unique stressors experienced by [CONTACT_286486] r prolonged periods of  time. 
This chronic exposure has been associated with inflammation and plaque development in the  vasculature 33. 
These stressors also function as barriers to the adoption of lifestyle behaviors that can prevent  and even reverse 
these conditions 34. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_286461], 
preparation of healthy foods, sleep, or fellowship; behaviors that have been  shown to minimize, and possibly 
reverse, the effects of chronic stress 6,[ADDRESS_349305], recent literature  supports the need for tailored interventions 
for midlife Black women based upon observed health  disparities and the strong relationship between health 
deterioration and chronic active copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 13,36   
 
 
 
3.3.2. Theoretical underpi[INVESTIGATOR_286462] a stress -reduction wellness intervention for midlife  
Black women, two theoretical frameworks will be used: Black Feminist Thought and Social Cognitive  
theory. Black Feminist Thought is a t heoretical point of view that seeks to clarify the ideas and experiences of  
Black women from the perspective of Black women.[ADDRESS_349306] Thought and its related constructs  
explain the elevated health risks and morbidity within the context of racism, sexism, and gendered  
expectations experienced by [CONTACT_286487].10,11 The “Strong Black Woman” is a cultural construct  
arising from the Black Feminist perspective and was a major theme identified in the PI’s preliminary work.8,37  
The ‘Strong Black Woman’ persona, encapsulates a set of characteristics, beliefs, and behaviors that have  
been historically associated with the ‘Strong Black Woman’ (independence, resilience, perseve rance) and  
deemed necessary for survival. This persona also contributes to a deterioration of health12 as women  
struggle to meet the expectations and needs of others with little regard for their own needs.29  
Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory39 will guide t he development of this intervention. Self -efficacy, a  
construct arising from Bandura’s theory, has been shown to influence the adoption of healthy lifestyle  
behaviors.40,41 Self -efficacy is defined as “an individual’s judgement of his or her capabilities t o organize and  
execute courses of action.”42 Self -efficacy recognizes that the intersectionality between person, behavior, and  
environment is key to understanding the motivations, perceptions, and barriers that influence decisions and the  
adoption of healt hy lifestyle behaviors.39,42 In understanding and recognizing the significant stressors in the  
lives of midlife Black women, we can make steps to change perceptions and behaviors For this research study,  
self-efficacy will be viewed as a mediator for the a doption of healthy lifestyle behaviors.  
 
3.3.3. Intervention Research Studies:  
Targeti ng Interventions to Black Women:  In general, intervention studies designed to improve  
healthy lifestyle behaviors are not focused on Black women. However, recommendations  on how to tailor and  
target this population exist.29,43 Interventions targeted to vulnerable populations such as midlife Black women  
are advised to incorporate theory and take into account cultural and social factors that influence the decision to  
adopt ( or avoid) specific behaviors.44 Mwenda et al. used the ‘Transtheoretical Model’ stages of change to  
evaluate factors associated with increased physical activity in a sample of hypertensive Black women.45 In  
another study, researchers concluded that the inc lusion of social networks and a variety of behavioral  
strategies is imperative when designing interventions intended to improve the adoption of healthy lifestyle  
behaviors in Black women.46 Social networks, in particular, are key cultural factors of import ance to midlife  
Black women.  Finally, a literature review of interventions to promote exercise in Black women recommended  
that intragroup differences and communal resources be assessed in the design and implementation of  
interventions.47 The results of these highlighted studies can be applied to future interventions.  
Interventions to Improve Health : Intervention studies focused on healthy lifestyle behaviors in Black  
women tend to target specific health behaviors such as cance r screening or exercise.  Few target general  
health or well -being.50,[ADDRESS_349307] and improving well -being.50 This research focused solely on work role  
experiences for Black women.  Napholz acknowledged the work role as a major life domain and discussed the  
 Page 8 of 29 Revis ed: January 11, [ADDRESS_349308]  
interactions.50 She proposed that gender - and culture -appropriate content impr oved the receptivity of her  
intervention and she advocated for the use of tailoring to improve interventions. Work stress was a significant  
stressor in the preliminary research focus group study conducted by [CONTACT_978]. The proposed research  
will look beyond w ork stress to include the multiple, competing stressors experienced by [CONTACT_286487].  
Gaston, Porter, & Thomas 52 created an intervention designed to improve knowledge about  
major illness and nutrition for midlife Black women. This intervention used a support group approach  
to increase  awareness and engagement.  In another study, civic engagement was used to promote  
participation in lifestyle b ehaviors that reduce CVD risk . The  adapted intervention was conducted in  
churches and ‘change clubs’ were formed. The ‘change clubs’ created a social network and group  
dynamic centered on improving lifestyle behaviors.  Both studies aimed to improve general health.  
Culturally relevant appro aches were identified but specific risk factors (i.e. stress) were not addressed.  
Stress Interventions : Stress -reduction intervention studies aimed at Black women have targeted  
health problems such as pre -term labor, high bl ood pressure, and obesity.  These  health problems  
have demonstrated strong associations with stress and alarming disparities for Black women. In a 
study by [CONTACT_286488],[ADDRESS_349309] cancer survivors. Alternatively, Cox and colleagues did not find significant success in their  
stress -augmented weight loss intervention program for adult Black women.55 Engagement was a key mediator  
related to lack of adherence to the intervention55 and is often proposed as a rationale for gender and cultural  
tailoring. These studies demonstrate a willingness of Black women to use a variety of stress -reduction  
strategies and highlights the importance of culture and inclusion when delivering interventions. No 
intervention studies were found that focus on the life stressors relev ant to midlife Black women and the  
mechanisms through which these stressors serve as barriers to health lifestyle behavior.  
 
3.3.4 . Technology Use During COVID -19 Pandemic .  
There has been a steady increase in the use of technology in behavioral interventions. The addition of 
technology has shown effectiveness in several areas that increase its popularity. Technology has potential to 
reach a wider scope of people, ease access to information, decrease barriers to participation, improve collection 
and retention of research data, and eliminate internal bias, among others. Technology used for information and 
communication in behavioral interventions has been shown to improve outcom es when combined with other 
methodologies such as face -to-face (Lau, Lau, Wong, & Ransdell, 2011) . Several systematic reviews focus on 
the use of technology in interventions designed to assess the effectiveness of physical  activity and/or dietary 
behavior change. In the majority of systematic reviews (Kroeze, Werkman, & Brug, 2006; Lau et al., 2011; van 
den Berg, Schoones, & Vliet Vlieland, 2007; Vandelanotte, Spathonis, Eakin, & Owen, 2007) , positive effects 
were noted with the addition of technology while others reported mixed results (Norman et al., 2007) . Due to 
the COVID -[ADDRESS_349310] will be conducted remotely online. The use of technology in this 
study has the potential to improve our knowledge about technology in behavioral research studies.

 Page 10 of 29 Revis ed: January 11, [ADDRESS_349313]. We will then pi[INVESTIGATOR_286463] e intervention using a sample of 50 women randomized to either the 
B-SWELL group or the WE (attention control) group. Satisfaction r atings will be obtained from  
participants. The study findings will be used to determine feasibility of the intervention and support a 
larger trial .  
6.2 Provide a description of all research procedures being performed and when they are 
performed, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety or 
minimize risks.  
 
6.2.1 Methods for Aim 1  
Aim 1: Develop the B-SWELL intervention for midlife Black women through the innovative  leveraging of 
CBPR and LS7 modifiable healthy lifestyle behaviors. In Aim 1, the content for both the  intervention (B -
SWELL) and control groups (WE) will be developed. The B -SWELL interven tion is proposed as  an 8-week 
community -based intervention, culturally tailored to decrease stress in midlife Black women while  
simultaneously addressing key risk factors associated with CVD (Figure 1). The B -SWELL program will  
address  key stressors and cu ltural themes identified in the PI’s preliminary research 8,9 to provide a unique  
approach tailored to midlife Black women. Each module in the 8 -week intervention will focus on the adverse  
effects of stress on health, in particular CVD, and the importance of minimizing these effects through healthy  
lifestyle behaviors (LS7) . Links will be drawn between stress and CVD risk factors such as lack of  exercise, 
poor diet, smoking, sleep deprivation, and non -adherence to treatment regimens. Stress reduction strate gies 
included in the B -SWELL will be presented with emphasis on the needs and  preferences of midlife Black 
women. For example, culturally relevant images will be used in guided  imagery exercises. The tools learned in 
the B -SWELL will enable participants to  be self -directed and  create personalized plans to adopt healthy 
lifestyle behaviors. Content will be delivered by [CONTACT_286489],  demonstration, and interactive exercises to increase 
engagement and promote inclusivity.   
Consider this scenario: a midlife Black  woman desires to improve her health and lifestyle  habits. 
Through the B -SWELL program, she gains  an understanding of how personal beliefs, culture,  and socialized 
expectations inform her lifestyle  decisions and affect her risk factors for CVD. She  learns strategies to address 
the key stressor in  her life: poor life balance. She receives support  and validation from other participants in the  
program and takes steps to adjust her schedule  and make time for exercise. She joins a carpool at  her daughter’s 
school that frees her up [ADDRESS_349314] End C -RAB and other community partners is critical to Aims 1 & 2.  
In CBPR, the community is recognized as a vital stakeholder to be included at every stage of the  
research. The C -RAB’s participation will ensure that the B -SWELL reflects the needs of midlife Black  
women. The final intervention, including its materials and processes, will reflect knowledge gained from the  
PI’s training plan, input from community colla borators, and refinements dictated by [CONTACT_286490].  
Data Collection Procedures : Aim 1. Data collection will occur during the development phase in  
Aim 1. Data will be collected using survey ratings about materials and components of the B -SWELL 
intervention from 10 identified experts. The expert panel will include four  midlife Black women laypersons, 
three researchers (identified as experts by [CONTACT_7661] a doctoral degree and  strong record of publication) , and three 
integrative health care specialists. Rating surveys will be similar to  those used by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bakas in her feasibility 
study 22 to assess accuracy, relevance, and feasibility. Ratings will be  averaged across the experts, with 
possible scores ranging  from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree.  
Recruitment and Informed Consent.  Following approval from the UC IRB, research activities will begin. 
In Aim 1, the intervention will be developed and expert raters will be recruited to assess and evaluate the  
intervention materials and content. Experts will be recruited by [CONTACT_286491], mail, telephone, or flyers. They will receive a study information sheet  explaining that 
participation  is voluntary and that their decision will not affect their relationship with the University of 
 Page 11 of 29 Revis ed: January 11, 2019  Cincinnati, their  employer, or the researchers. Full information will be provided and questions answered prior to 
consent.  Incentives will be provided to the experts for particip ation.  
 
 
 6.2.2. Methods for Aim 2  
Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of the B -SWELL intervention with a trial of 50 midlife Black women 
randomized to the B -SWELL intervention (25) or to a general wellness education (WE) control group (25). Aim 
2 will focus on conducting a successful trial of the 8 -week B -SWELL intervention for midlife Black  women. 
The preliminary conceptual model in Figure 2 will guide this phase of the research. We anticipate that  the 
model will be refined as we synthesize the new knowledge and feedback from the community (Aim 1).  During 
Aim 2, community -based activities will focus on the  recruitment, trial, data collection, and dissemination.  
Midlife Black women will be recruited and randomized into  one of two groups: B -SWELL intervention group 
or a wellness education control group , WE group . Sessions will be held online using the Zoom online platform 
which has been approved and is supported by [CONTACT_286492].   Participants will be asked not to share 
intervention materials or experiences with midlife Black women outside  of their assigned group. Participants in 
both groups will be  introduced to AHA’s LS7 behaviors, LS7 materials, and the LS7 website  using B -SWELL 
tablets . Participants in the B -SWELL intervention group will also receive education about stress, with a focus 
on unique stressors experienced by [CONTACT_286487].  
 Program evaluation will be ongoing. Data collection  telephone interviews will occur at three  time 
points: baseline (pre -intervention), 8 weeks (completion of the  study), and 12 weeks ([ADDRESS_349315] intervention) 
for both the B -SWELL and WE groups. Outcome measures  will include LS7 scores, number of unhealthy days, 
depressive symptoms, and perceived general health.  Ratings will be obtained from community collaborators to 
evaluate recruitment, rete ntion, and treatment fidelity  for both groups. Qualitative feedback and s atisfaction 
ratings for the B -SWELL group s, WE groups , and technology will be obtained from participants at completion.   
Recruitment and Eligibility:  Aim 2: The sample of participants for Aim [ADDRESS_349316] of 50  
Black or African -American women randomized to a B -SWELL group (n=25) or to a WE attention control  
group (n=25). Inclusion criteria include being Black or African -American, between the ages of [ADDRESS_349317], pregnant, terminal illness  (i.e., late stage cancer, end -of-life condition, 
renal failure requiring dialysis), history of Alzheimer’s,  dementia, or severe mental illness (i.e., suicidal 
tendencies, schizophrenia, or severe untreated  depre ssion), or any other major health conditions or disabilities 
(i.e. visual impairment, blindness, deafness) prohibiting safe or full participation in the  program. Recruitment 
will involve use of fliers, referral, snowballing, and purposeful sampling in targ eted communities. Fliers may be 
posted  in businesses,  on list serves , or group websites to increase  distribution .  The [ADDRESS_349318] 
virtually using a Zoom account established through the UC CON  for the PI . Dates an d times of the online 
virtual sessions will be established based on availability of the participants  following randomization .  
 Interventions and Treatment Fidelity Methods : The B -SWELL intervention will follow procedures  
such as those proposed in Figure 1 and will be refined prior to trial based on feedback from the community  
collaborators and expert ratings (Aim1). Participants will be randomized to either the B -SWELL or WE groups.  
Both groups will be introduced to the LS 7 materials. The B -SWELL will receive additional instruction  about 
stress. B -SWELL and WE group sessions will occur on different dates and times and, participants  will be asked 
not to share experiences with women outside of their assigned group. Participan ts will also be asked to secure  
private location when attending the virtual sessions to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Treatment fidelity of  
both groups will be monitored using Borrelli’s Treatment Fidelity Checklist (Design, Training, Delivery, 
Rece ipt, Enactment) . Facilitators of the intervention and control groups will be trained prior to the start of the 
trials.. Zoom meetings will be audio taped for quality assurance.  
Data Collection Procedures : Aim 2. Data collection will occur at baseline, 8 we eks, and 12 weeks.  
Baseline d ata will be collected from B -SWELL and WE participants using telephone interviews conducted  by 
[CONTACT_23872], blinded research assistants . Data collection at 8 and 12 weeks may be collected via phone interview or 
through a REDCap lin k on the B -SWELL study tablets provided to B-SWELL and WE  participant.  Completion 
 Page 12 of 29 Revis ed: January 11, 2019  of the surveys  (interview  or via REDCap link)  is expected to last 30 -45 minutes  for each timepoint . Instruments 
are listed in Table 5.  3.4.d.  
Randomiz ation Procedures : Following baseline data collection, participants will be randomized to  
either the B -SWELL or WE group using 1:1 block randomization to promote equal group sizes. The  
randomization allocation sequence will be blinded to data collectors to avoid bias during follow -up data  
collection telephone interviews. Following randomization, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_286464]. Treatment fidelity will be monitored using the  
Borrel li’s Treatment Fidelity Checklist (Design, Training,  Delivery, Receipt, Enactment).  
Recruitment and Informed Consent.  In Aim 2, trial of the intervention will be conducted. Participants for 
the trial of the intervention will be recruited  using fliers, refe rral, snowballing, and purposeful sampling in 
targeted  communities. Fliers may be posted on list serves or group websites to increase distribution.  A letter of  
introduction and study information sheet will be the first contact [CONTACT_286493]. A telephone number is 
provided for  potential participants to call if they wish to participate. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_286465] a private location to protect confidentiality of the participant. If eligible and interested in

6.3 Describe:  Procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude o f risks.  
This study has minimal risk . Some survey items asked during the phone interviews  may focus on negative 
emotions or experiences. There is a risk of loss of confidentiality for  participants involved in the study  given the 
online Zoom platform  used for each session . Audiotapes of the  Zoom  sessions are for quality assurance . 
Transcriptions  will be de -identified. There are no anticipated physical, social, legal, or other potential risks  
connected with the proposed procedures. The alternat ive to participating in the study is not to participate in the  
study. Participants and experts may withdraw at any time or may choose not to answer items during the  
interviews that make them uncomfortable.  
Protections against risk.  Participants may choose not to answer items during interviews or participate in  
portions of the intervention program with which they are uncomfortable. In the unlikely event that a participant  
appears to be distressed, she will be referred to appropriate resources or be given the  telephone number for  the 
national Suicide Hotline (800 -784-2433; 800 -SUICID E) if appropriate. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_286467]/or any amendments to the protocol. Training for data collectors also will include how  to 
respond to any pote ntial adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_4317], such as suicidal tendencies or severe  
depression. Participants with these types of problems will be given information about how to seek help and will  
be encouraged to inquire whether medication and/or psych ological counseling would be helpful. In the event of  
suicidal thoughts, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_286468] a health care provider on the participant’s behalf  so that 
they can contact [CONTACT_286494].  
 To avoid loss of confidentiality during the online Zoom se ssions, participants will be asked to find a 
private location from which to attend the online Zoom sessions. Additionally, participants will be required to 
attend Zoom sessions with vide o and will be asked to keep session  discussions and activities private.  
Only authorized study personnel will have access during  the Zoom sessions, Zoom audiotapes or 
transcriptions, REDCap data, database , or contact [CONTACT_286495]. 
For data analysis, study ID numbers will be generated to protect the identity of the  participants in the final data 
set. Participants will not be identified in any way in reports or m anuscripts from the  study. Data from surveys 
will input directly into a RE DCap database  either manually or via the link on the study tablets . REDCap is 
backed up nightly by [CONTACT_286496]. Only authorized study personnel will have access to REDCap. A ny calls to 
participants will be made  to a telephone number provided by [CONTACT_108704] a time that is convenient for the

deviations, and frequencies) regarding  expert ratings of degrees of accuracy,  relevance and feasibility of new  
components of the B -SWELL program  (Aim 1), and recruitment, retention,  treatment fidelity ratings, and 
satisfaction  ratings (Aim 2a). For Aims 2b and 2c,  numerical dependent variables (stress,  self-efficacy, LS7 
scores, unhealthy days,  perceived general health, depressive symptoms) will be inspected of empi[INVESTIGATOR_286470]. Variable transfo rmation will be 
used otherwise. All statistical tests will be performed using SPSS Version 25. Parameter estimates with P -
values less  than .[ADDRESS_349336] used  
will be checked using residual plots, qq -plots, and tests for hom ogene ity of variance/ covariance. In Aim 2b, 
continuous mediators (stress, self -efficacy) will be compared between groups (B -SWELL vs  WE) using t -tests 
at each visit (baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks).  
 
In Aim 2c, using mixed effect models, primary (i.e., LS7 s ummary scores) and secondary outcome measures 
(i.e., unhealthy days, perceived general health, depressive symptoms) will be assessed for their associations 
with time (baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks), group (B -SWELL vs. WE), and interaction. In particular, eac h of the 
outcome measures will be treated as the dependent variable, and the time effect, group effect, and the 
interaction will be treated as independent variables or fixed effects of interest in the mixed effect model. 
Random effects will be used to acco unt for within person correlation due to repeated measurements. Other 
covariates, such as demographics and attendance rate, will be controlled for by [CONTACT_286501]. Post hoc analysis of  group means will be compared cross -
sectionally, as well as longitudinally between time points (such as week 8 or 12 vs. baseline). Considering the 
limited sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -type of study, statistical tests will not be adjusted for multiple compar isons in 
post hoc analyses. Significant findings will be considered preliminary in nature and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_286471].  
 
Power. Statistical power is analyzed based upon assumptions that we have N=50 total or N=25/group complete 
all four  data collection time  points with complete observations. Should there be any concern of dropout from the 
study, we will over sample participants at baseline to offset the predicted dropout rate and ensure the proposed 
sample size in the final visit. The statistical tests are t wo sided with a targeted significance level of 0.05. In 
Aim2b and Aim2c post hoc analyses when we compare means using a two group t -test with equal variances 
assumption, we will reach 85% power to detect an effect size (i.e. difference of means/standard de viation of the 
difference) of 0.87.[ADDRESS_349337] between visits in a group, we will 
reach the 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.63.[ADDRESS_349338] 
differences. The main emphasis will be on exploring data trends to inform future work, rather than

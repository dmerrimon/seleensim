Study Title :    Increasing Adherence to Pulmonary Rehabilitation after COPD related  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569717]: Version  6 April 14, 2021     
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis :  Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a critical part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
treatment, reducing breathlessness, increasing health -related quality of life (QOL), and decreasing healthcare 
utilization.  However, only a small portion of patients with COPD complete PR, mostly due to access issues or 
frailty. In this application we propose to test the effectiveness of a home -based PR program developed in our 
previous NIH awards that aims to improve program adherence, QOL, d aily physical activity, and healthcare 
utilization.  
 
Aims, purpose, or objectives : Aim 1: To refine the current program of home  PR (crafted through NIH grant 
R44HL11416/IRB 14 -009016 for out patients ) via a pi[INVESTIGATOR_569718] a disease -related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210345] a qualitative feedback of  patient caregivers and coaches by (a)  
completing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_747280] with COPD after a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and  (b) ana lyzing the experience of 
subjects, caregivers, and coaches through a formal qualitative study and  refining the intervention in year 1 . The 
refined home -based PR program will be tested in a well -powered phase 2 randomized, clinical trial of 150  
patients that will be started in the R61 period and finalized in the R33 period.  
Aim 2: To start a phase 2 randomized, clinical trial (recruit 30/150) testing the feasibility and study accrual of  
a refined home -based  PR delivered after a COPD related h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_210346] a control group of  patients 
referred to conventional PR (center -based) in year 2 . 
 
Background : Despi[INVESTIGATOR_210347], the proportion of people with COPD who receive Pulmonary 
Rehabilitation (PR) is very small. The current model of a center -based PR program fails to address the needs of 
many patients with COPD. The most common patient barrier to at tendance is travel to center -based programs, 
particularly for frail patients with more severe COPD who need transportation assistance. Home -based, 
unsupervised PR has been proposed as an alternative model to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based programs and has been found to 
be safe and effective. In particular PR post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210348] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715]; however, the reality is that many times this is not a feasible intervention as 
only 4% of eligible individuals are able to adhere to PR after a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (for multiple reasons).While 
COPD is responsible for nearly 700,[ADDRESS_747281] medical costs of COPD, are potentially preventable  
readmissions.  
Study Design and Methods  
 

  
       Page 2 of 19 
 Version 2, January 8, 2019  Methods : 
 
 Figure 1  
 
Phase  1 (R61) :  A cohort of 10 -15 patients will be recruited after a COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (COPD 
exacerbation or pneumonia) to use the home PR program system plus telephonic coaching for twelve  weeks, 
and provide feedback through a qualitative study to refine the PR program system to be acceptable for the post -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521].  Patients  will be recruited until themes saturation (no mo re new feedback from patients).  
 
We will use Slicer Dicer in Epic  to query the electronic medical records of Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster  to identify 
all patients presenting with COPD -related illness.  In addition we will screen the patients admitted to the Chest 
Service  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The study coordinator will receive the list of participants 
(with research authorization already processed through the natura l language program) and will meet the patient 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569719].  
 
 During the consent process, the patient will have the opportunity to try the proposed home -based PR system in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223], aiding in their confidence in their ability to use the system and the ease of the exercises. The 
study team will provide a ste p by [CONTACT_210379] (following the exercises on the computer 
tablet).  The participant will be asked to rate their confidence to use the technology presented and their 
confidence (self -efficacy) to perform the home rehabilitation routi ne on a scale from 0 (no confidence) to 10 

  
       Page 3 of 19 
 Version 2, January 8, 2019  (great confidence). A rating of  five or greater will be deemed an acceptable confidence level to participate in the 
study.    
Each participant will be asked to define a particular place and time they can perform the home -based PR. The 
physical and mental environment is critical for the successful adoption of new behavior (PR). Participants will 
learn about the weekly calls with t he coach to discuss their rehabilitation and monitored measures (steps, level  
of shortness of breath, well -being, and fatigue). They will then go over the daily answers to well -being 
questions (mood, breathlessness, and energy, as tested in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_210350].2; see participant  
software application section below). After performing the PR routine (to ensure safety and understanding) and  
reviewing the use of the monitors, a plan for a PR coach call, a week to 10 days after discharge. The participant  
will use the criterion activity monitor (Actigraph, Fig. 3) that will determine the baseline physical activity  
during the first week immediately after discharge to define a baseline physical activity. The coordinator will  
discuss the in -home activities with the participant to identify possible exercise -related fall  hazards in the home 
environment.  
 
                      
Figure [ADDRESS_747282] six days a week. The Garmin Vívofit ™ 
activity monitor (Fig. 4) is to be worn at all times (battery lasts one year) to capture daily steps and the 
metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) per day. The PR routine begins with a slow breathing awareness exercise, 
“pursed lips breathing,” followed by [CONTACT_210380] -extremity exercise s (Fig. 2), then two walks (in the home or outside) 
for 6 minutes, and finishing with another slow and mindful pursed -lips breathing exercise. The exercise 
protocol lasts about 20 minutes, which is the amount of daily dedicated exercise time associated wit h a risk 
reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210351]22,23 and is recommended by [CONTACT_210381].13 The 
proposed protocol is also currently being used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_210352] a prospective COPD trial (R01 
CA163293) in addition to the work cite d in the preliminary data (R44 HL114162). The PR coach will contact 
[CONTACT_210382], or referring, provider before initiating the PR program to introduce the 
provider to the study, as well as to coordinate and develop a strategy in case o f a COPD exacerbation (a 
common cause of PR abandonment).   
The proposed home -based PR system (Fig.1) consists of three commercial devices and two software  
applications. The devices are a Garmin Vívofit ™ (AM), a Nonin 3150 WristOx2® Pulse Oximeter (PO), and a 
7” 
Android ™ tablet with 3G/4G cellular service (Verizon). The AM and PO wirelessly communicate with the 
tablet  

  
       Page 4 of 19 
 Version 2, January 8, 2019  via Bluetooth. During the upper extremity exercise routine and  walks, the PO measures the participants’ heart 
rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Near the end of the day, the tablets periodically sound a musical alarm 
and display a short health status questionnaire (Fig. 2) asking participants to rate their well -being,24 ease of 
breathing, and energy level. At night, the tablets securely transmit the device data and well -being questionnaire  
answers to a remote Web server, which securely stores the data and generates reports. Health coaches call the 
participants weekly to discuss their progress in PR and SM (see below).  
Participant software application (tablet) : When  the participant turns on the Android ™ tablet, the application 
logs in, and the participant accesses to the main screen (Fig. 5). To initiate one of these activities, the user 
selects the corresponding action from the “To -Do” column. Selecting “Exercise” from the “To -Do” column 
initiates a video guiding the user through the PR exercises (Fig. 6). Similarly, selecting “Walk” from the “To -
Do” column starts a 6 -minute countdown once the application detects that th e participant has initiated  
walking. Before displaying the exercise and walking videos the application verifies that the participant is 
wearing the AM and PO to assure measure and compliance (during exercise an increase in heart rate is 
expected). When the participant finishes the se lected activity, it appears in the “Done” column. The application 
provides instructions before and between each activity. Patients are asked to follow the videos in all PR sessions 
to maintain a minimal and equal “dose” of PR for all participants. The oxim eter data during exercise is used as a 
measure of adherence and exercise time.  
       
Figure 5            Figure 6  
 
 
 
The “my journey” screen (Fig.7) plots historical data, allowing participants to see trends as in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   

  
       Page [ADDRESS_747283] the historical window (e.g., last week, last month, last quarter).  
       
Coaching PR Calls (weeks 1 -12) content for PR  
feedback plus SM: After the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210353], coaching calls will occur weekl y for   twelve  weeks 
following this protocol : (1) Listen to the participant’s journey. (2) Provide feedback of the PR process at home 
based on the feedback from the coach application. Sessions will generate dialogue by [CONTACT_138202] “change 
participant’s comments on anticipated activities. (3) If problems arise, resist the urge to attempt to solv e the 
participant’s problems and barriers. (4) Listen carefully and kindly (ambivalence fr om the participant in 
changing their behavior). (5) Discuss how behaviors connect to the participant’s values and strengths. (6) 
Collaborate in setting goal(s) for the following week. A goal can be anything the patient wants to discuss even 
beyond PR (like  smoking cessation, vaccinations, weight loss, etc.) (7) Discuss the process of action planning : 
elicit the participant’s preferences. (8) Elicit the participant’s choice; do not assign goals, and use the 
participant’s language to describe the goal. (9) As sess confidence for goal completion, reaffirm commitment to 
the action plan, and express optimism. (10) Thank the participant and plan the next call.  
(11) All calls will be recorded to ensure fidelity and compliance with the protocol and MI principles (10% of  
all calls will be reviewed).  
Health Coach Software Application : The health coach software application provides three types of reports. 
The overview report (Fig. 8) allows health coaches to succinctly ascertain the status of their participants and 
flag anyone who may be experiencing problems. The health coach may  select a  participant  
from the  overview to  display the  trend report  (Fig. 9). The  trend report allows  the health coach to review the 
participant’s progress between weekly health coaching sessions.  Finally, the health coach may select a day 
from the trend report to display a detailed report (figure 10).

While participant monitoring does not occur in real time, any significant physiologic abnormaility measured 
during rehabilitation and transmitted to the server (02 saturation less than 80% or heart reate grater than 140 or 
less than 40 beats per minute) prompts a message to the coach to call the particpant to investigate the eve nt.

appropratie res ponse.  In R44HL114162 -03 Home -Based Health Management of COPD Patients, the remote 
rehabilitation and health coaching system h as been pi[INVESTIGATOR_569720], actionable,and 
acceptable.  After the pi[INVESTIGATOR_210356], a qualitatitve study will be done to identify areas of deficits to be 
changed and then adapted for the the second phase of the study, a randomized c ontrol trial.

Phase 2 (R 61):  Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster and Jacksonville Fl will participate in this Phase.  Phase 2 will take part 
in year 2 of the study.  After the study has been refined in Phase 1, t hirty (30) participants (of the planned 150 
subjects) will be recruited and randomized  to one of two to the home -based PR or referred to conventional PR 
(standard of care).   After the 30 subjects are enrolled, the study staf f will review the feasibility, informing the 
team about accrual and outcome completion rate (questionn aires and activity monitors).   This will allow the 
study team to forcast a complete and informative study for the R33.    
The particpants randomized to control/conventional care will be offered mileage reimbursement to and from a 
pulmonary rehab center.  The miliage rate used will be the current IRS standard rate (57.5 cents per mile in 
2020).   The study will pay mileage up to a total of $500.   Study  staff will use MapQuest to determine the miles 
from participants residence to the rehab center.  The participants will be asked to sign an Authorization to 
Release Protected Health Information -Research in order to obtain Pulmonary Rehabiliation Records. Mileage  
will be paid monthly when possible, or when in reciept of the medical records confirming attendence.   
 
 
Phase 3 (R33):  To assist with recruitment, Mayo Clinic Arizona and Health Partners will be added to project.  
Dr.  from the Arizona campus will be the Co - Investigator in Arizona and Dr.  
 will be the Co -Investigator at Health Partners in  the Twin Cities of Minnesota.   Mayo Clinic 
[COMPANY_002]ster Health Coaches may cover for Health Partners Health Coaches for abesences that include vacations , 
leaves and gaps in coverage due to availability of staff.  The Mayo [COMPANY_002]ster Health Coaches have access to the 
data entered into REDCap (such as demographics and Health Coach notes) and do not have access to the Health 
Partners medical record.   
The COVID [ADDRESS_747284] closed  or are limiting attendence.  On October 14, 2020 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) updated the Medicare rules to include telehealth for pulmonary rehabiliation.  It is anticipated 
that many centers will naturally navigate to this method  of delivery.  Phase [ADDRESS_747285] to be flexible to this 
new environment. Patients will be randomized to one of two arms; home -based pul monary rehab or Choice.  
The patients randomized to Choice will have the ability to choose between centerbased rehabiliation or 
telehealth rehabiliation.   Mayo  Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster and Jacksonville Fl will participate in this Phase.   After review 
of the first 30 participants, t he remaining 120 patients with a COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (exacerbation or 
pneumonia) will be randomzied at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569721] -based PR or Choice  (referral to conventional 
center -based PR  or telehealth -based PR ).  Inclusi on, exclusion criteria and recruitment will be identical to the 
Phase 1 and 2 of the study. Randomization will be completed online through a centralized program Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).   
The participants randomized to home -based PR will follow the same procedures in the R61 phase, plus any 
changes suggested by [CONTACT_210384].  Any changes will involve a protocol modification and submitted to 
the IRB for review.  
 
Questionnaires and Activity Monitor:  All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and wear a 
small activity monitor (Actigraph) at Baseline and Months 3,6 and 12.   The participants will be supplied with 
postage paid envelopes to return the q uestionnaires and activity monitor.  Questionnaires will be reviewed 
within 48 hours of receiving the quesitonnaire in the mail.  
 
Questionnaires:  Questionnaires include the Medical Research Council  (MRC), Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6004] (CRQ), EureoQol -5D (EQ5D), Patient Health Questionnaire - 2 question ( PHQ2 ), General 

  
       Page 8 of 19 
 Version 2, January 8, 2019  Anxiety Disorder – 2 question (GAD2), Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL),  Self -Management 
Ability Scale (SMAS30), Linear Analog Scale Assessment  (LASA) , Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MIL) and 
the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI).  All questionnaires with the exception of the WAI will be administered 
at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 Month.  The WAI questionnaire will be administered when the participa nt has 
completed the Health Coaching Period.  For participants randomized to the Intervention arm, th e WAI will be 
administered at 3 months.  Participants randomized to the Control/Wait arm will receive the WAI at 6 months.  
The Charlson Cormobidity Index (CCI) will be included in the baseline questionnaire packet.  The CCI will 
assist in summarizing the enrolled subjects in statistical models.  
 
 
Health Care Utilization:  The Study Coordinator will contact [CONTACT_210386] 3,[ADDRESS_747286] gone to the 
doctor/Emergency Room/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210358].  In addition, the particpants will be asked if they 
have taken antibiotics or prednisone for breathing related illnesses since the last time the Study Coordinator 
called them.  
 
Conventional PR group: Referral to Conventional PR (retention strategies)  
Participants who randomize to Choice will have the option of attending Center  based rehabilitation or a 
telehealth option.  We plan to optimize the possibility of patients referred to Center  PR to attend by [CONTACT_57148] a 
dialogue about the importance of PR, facilitating the referral and then follow up with a call. This optimization 
initiative includes targeting the most prevalent problems that explain the current poor utilization of the 
traditi onal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based PR after a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: (1) lack of a ref erral or strong recommendation from a 
physician (we  plan to do a dedicated referral to the [patient indicating the nearest PR program and contact 
[CONTACT_210387]), and (2) inadequate follow -up or facilitation of enrollment after 
referral (we will communicate with the individu als two weeks after discharge to encourage PR program 
adherence).  
Finally, we acknowledge that many patients/caregivers will clearly express being unable to attend conventional  
PR and realize then that the control arm receive no active intervention. The latter is a significant problem in 
behavioral interventions that cannot be blinded. To palliate that problem and given that the project targets daily 
physical activity, we will provide every individual in the conventional PR group a Garmin Vivofit (Fig. 3), an 
activity monitor that has a large display and is easy to use so that they can monitor steps every day. W e have 
ample  experience on the use of this monitor in current pour pro posal. This is the same monitor that individuals 
in the Home PR receive for daily use. The study does not cover standard of care treatment.  
 
In addition, the particpants randomized to Choice whom chose a center based rehab will be offered mileage 
reimbursement to and from a pulmonary rehab center.  The miliage rate used will be the current IRS standard 
rate (57.5 cents per mile in 2020).  The study will pay  mileage up to a total of $500.  Study staff will use 
MapQuest to determine the miles from participants residence to the rehab center.  The participants will be asked 
to sign an Authorization to Release Protected Health Information -Research in  order to obtain Pulmonary 
Rehabiliation Records. Mileage will be paid monthly when possible, or when in reciept of the medical records 
confirming attendence.   
 Home PR group: Proceedings will be as in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_210359] (see R61, Phase 1 and 2).  
 
Recording of calls and qualitative interviews:   All health coaching calls and the qualitative interviews will be 
recorded.  The health coaching calls are recorded and the voice file saved on a secure research drive that only 
  
       Page [ADDRESS_747287].’s Benzo and  will score the health coach using the MITI worksheet (attached, Appendix 1).  The 
voicefiles will be deleted off of the research drive at the end of the study.

Recording identifiers (including a code) during the conduct of the study allows you to return to the medical 
record or data source to delete duplicate subjects, check a missing or questionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De-identified data is medical informati on that has been stripped of all HIPAA identifier s so that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De -identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.

Data Analysis  
 
 
Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but end -point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if 
not including all of the infor mation.  
 
Power Statement :  The primary endpoint of this study will be the rate of adherence compared between the two 
groups. Secondary endpoints include rates of COPD related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059], activity levels as measured 
by [CONTACT_210388], and the CRQ sc ales of dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, physical, 
mastery, and the total score. Differences between groups will be compared with Fisher’s exact tests for 
  
       Page 13 of 19 
 Version 2, January 8, 2019  proportions and ttests for continuous endpoints. These analyses will be supplemented with logistic regression 
models and linear models to compare groups after adjusting for confounding factors.  
 
Data Analysis Plan: One hundred and forty -four patients will be entered on this study (72 per arm). After 
adjusting for multiple comparisons, this sample size will provide at least 80% power to detect a difference in the 
rates of adherence of  6% in the control group to 50% in the intervention group. This sample size will also 
provide at least 80% power for detecting a 50% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death rates (from 50% in the 
control group at 6 months to 25% in the intervention group at 6 months), a difference of 1000 steps at 3 months 
(assuming a standard deviation [SD] of 2,000 steps), and a 0.5 difference in CRQ summa ry scores at 3 months 
(assuming an SD of 1.0). The sample size will be increased to 150 (75 per arm) to account for a 5% drop out 
rate. 
 
 
 
 
Statistical Analysis and Power  
The primary endpoint of this study will be the rate of adherence compared between the two groups. Secondary  
endpoints include rates of COPD related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059], activity levels as measured by [CONTACT_569724], and the CRQ scales of dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, physical, mastery, and  the 
total score. Differences between groups will be compared with Fisher’s exact tests for proportions and ttests  
for continuous endpoints. These analyses will be supplemented with logistic regression models and linear  
models to compare groups after adjusting for confounding factors.  
One hundred and forty -four patients will be entered on this study (72 per arm). After adjusting for multiple  
comparisons, this sample size will provide at least 80% power to detect a difference in the rates of adherence of   
26% in the control group to 50% in the intervention group. This sample size will also provide at least 80%  
power for detecting a 50% reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death rates (from 50% in the control group a t 6  
months to 25% in the intervention group at 6 months), a difference of 1000 steps at 3 months (assuming a   
standard deviation [SD] of 2,000 steps), and a 0.5 difference in CRQ summary scores at 3 months (assuming  an 
SD of 1.0). The sample size will be increased to 150 (75 per arm) to account for a 5% drop out rate.  
Outcomes for the Phase 2 Randomized study  
Aim 3a: Adherence will be our primary outcome  
Overview: The reported adherence for PR after a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] 4% and in the best case scenario (free PR  
and free transportation like in the [LOCATION_006]) is 10%. From our preliminary data, now in press (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1511]), we  
found an adherence of >80% to the proposed system in outpatients with COPD. We hypothesize the adherence  
to a complete home -based PR program by [CONTACT_447] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210361] 50%, and the adherence to  
the conventional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based PR program to be 25% (due to our strong efforts to encourage people attend)  
will consider a complete PR when 75% of the expected PR visits are completed. We will compute the degree of  
completion of conventional PR from our electronic health record (EHR). The home -based PR compliance will  
be assessed by [CONTACT_210389].  
Aim 3b: CRQ Physical and Emotional Summary scores post PR  
To determine the effect size of the home -based PR system with health coaching on physical and emotional  
QOL, we will analyze the CRQ physical and emotional summary scores. The CRQ Physical Summary score  
includes dyspnea (symptom #1 in COPD) and fatigue (symptom #2 in COPD) domains; the CRQ Emotion  
Summary score, includes the emotion (independent factor for admissions and poor quality of life) and mastery  
(self-management) domains of the CRQ.[ADDRESS_747291] reliability is adequate in all subscales, but is particularly high in the  
subscales of fatigue (r=0.90), emotion (r=0.93), and mastery (r=0.91).[ADDRESS_747292] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].   
Aim 3 c: Daily Physical activity post PR  
Physical activity is the strongest predictor of survival in COPD and is independently related to  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].26,27 Physical activity will be measured by [CONTACT_136920] ™ wGT3X -BT activity monitor ( Fig. 
8), which has been validated and used to assess physical activity in COPD populations.[ADDRESS_747293] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210362] -specified time points (Figure 17) and will measure steps and 
minutes  spent in sedentary, light, and moderate activity.30,31 The main daily  physical activity outcome is the  
number of daily steps (most common, generalizable and simple) . Secondary, but important,  measures to be 
analyzed are activity counts, minutes per day spent in daily physical activities of at least  moderate intensity, and 
sedentary time (<2METs metabolic equivalents).32We will also measure sleep time  and sleep efficiency with 
this monitor.  
Aim 3d: COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715] (COPD exacerbation or pneumonia as discharge  
diagnosis) at one month, three months and six months.  They will be assessed by [CONTACT_210390] (a safety measure in case individuals are  rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_210363]). The calls 
will occur every three months (to avoid recall bias), will use  a scripted protocol as in a previous application, and 
will be conducted by a coordinator blinded to the  intervention. Emergency Department (ED) visits and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (all cause) will also be recorded.  
Aim 4: CE analysis EuroQol Five Dimensions questionnaire  
The EuroQol Five Dimensions questionnaire (EQ -5D) is a standardized instrument for measuring generic  health 
status. The health status measured with EQ -5D is used for estimating preference weight for that health  status, 
then, by [CONTACT_210391], a quality -adjusted life year (QALY) can be computed. QALYs  gained 
its used as an outcome in the cost -utility analysis, which is a type of economic evaluation that compares  the 
benefit and cost of healthcare programs or interventions. EQ -5D is one of th e most commonly used generic  
health status measurements, and its good validity and reliability have been reported in various health  conditions. 
It will be the tool to be used in the proposed cost -effectiveness analysis (CEA).  
Secondary Outcomes  
Self-Efficacy: The Mastery domain of the CRQ will be used to assess self -efficacy. The CRQ questions  
assessing self -efficacy are “In the last two weeks, how much of the time did you feel very confident and sure  
that you could deal with your illness?” and “How often during the last two weeks did you feel you had complete  
control of your breathing problems?  
Baseline Demographics and comorbidities: Baseline demographics to be collected include age, mMRC,  
FEV1, highest grade completed in school, marital status, gender, structural and functional social support,33  
race, steroid (prednisone) use in the three months before the study, comorbid conditions (Charlson  
Comorbidity Index), smoking status, and previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210364].  
Analyses  
There are three distinct quantitative study hypotheses (inform different aspects of the process).  
Hypothesis 3a (Aim 3a) states that adherence will be higher in subject referred to home PR, will be tested with  
  
       Page 15 of 19 
 Version 2, January 8, 2019  Fisher’s exact test supplemented with logistic regression adjusting for dyspnea MRC, age, social support,  
comorbidities, and FEV1. Exploratory analyses will be performed to examine how the number of rehab sessions  
impacts hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/ED rates, CRQ dyspnea score, CRQ emotional score, and number of daily steps.  
Hypothesis 3b (Aim 3b): participants on home -based PR will have higher physical (dyspnea fatigue) and,  higher 
emotional CRQ summary scores at month three than participants who were referred to conventional   
PR. Tested with t -tests supplemented with linear regression models adjusting for baseline scores and dyspnea  
MRC, age, social support, comorbidities and FEV1.  
Hypothesis 3 c (aim 3c): participants on home -based PR will have more daily PA than participants referred to  
conventional PR at month three. This will be measured by [CONTACT_210392], light,  and 
moderate activity measured by [CONTACT_136920].30,[ADDRESS_747294] activity monitor used for outcome measures (7 -day wearing) at baseline, 3, and 6 months; and  the 
Garmin Vivofit PR activity monitor, which will be used daily, but will NOT be used as an outcome measure,  
rather for PR and health coaching and participant awareness of physical activity (participant wil l keep this  
activity monitor). Tested with Wilcoxon tests supplemented with linear regression models adjusting for  baseline 
values and dyspnea MRC, age, social support, comorbidities and FEV1.  
Hypothesis 3d (Aim 3d): individuals in the home -based PR program will have lower readmissions and ER visits  
compared to individual referred to conventional PR. Tested with Fisher’s exact test supplemented with logistic  
regression models adjusted for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210365], age, dyspnea, and comorbidities.  
For the continuous study outcomes , changes from baseline to three months will be compared between the  
study arms using two -sample, two -sided t -tests with 5% type I error rates. Changes in QOL, number of steps,  
and length of stay will be compared between the two treatment sequences using two -sample two -sided t -tests.  
No adjustments will be made for multiple testing. Means, SDs, medians, ranges, and frequency distributions  
will be reported and plotted over time by [CONTACT_30157]. Linear models will be used to assess the impact of   
treatment arm on three -month outcomes after adjusting for the corresponding baseline measure and other  
variables related to the outcome (age, degree of breathlessness at baseline using the mMRC dyspnea, and  
FEV1). Repeated measures mixed models will be used to estimate the intervention effect over the 6 months of  
the study (this will measure trajectory and maintenance of benefits / behavior change). Intent -to-treat analyses  
will also be performed to determine the sensitivity of the results to dropouts and missing values. In the intent to - 
treat analyses, if a month three measure is missing for any reason, it will be described as not changing from  
baseline. Healthcare utilization (number of ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165433], and length of stay) between baseline and  
three months will be treated (analyzed) as both binary (for incidence rates) and continuous (for the number of  
events). The binary endpoints will all be compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression  
models will also be fit to look for differences in these outcomes by [CONTACT_210393], mMRC, FEV1,  
baseline levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, and baseline healthcare utilization, (before starting the study)  
particularly hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210365].  
Descriptive summaries of the changes between baseline, three, six, and nine months will be used to assess the  
effect of the home based intervention on the control arm and the residual beneficial effect on the intervention  
arm. These results will be only descriptive and exploratory. No formal hypothesis testing will be done. All data  
will be stored in REDCap and analyzed using SAS (Cary, NC).  
Per-Protocol Analysis (Dose Response): We will conduct an exploratory analysis to assess the effect of  dose of 
PR sessions on study outcomes. This analysis will control for potential confounders of dose.  
Assessment of Bias: Potential bias due to loss to follow -up will be assessed using a time to event analysis for  
the association of patient characteristics with time to dropout; results will be reported and used to evaluate the  
robustness of the study findings. We will also conduct sensitivity analyses in which missing data for dropouts  
are imputed under plausible missing -not-at-random assumptions.  
  
       Page 16 of 19 
 Version 2, January 8, 2019  Missing data: A common affliction with randomized clinical trial field experiments is noncompliance with  both 
treatment and missing study participation data. To estimate the overall treatment effect for the entire  sample, an 
"intention to treat" analysis will be conducted, using our above likelihood -based analysis method  for repeated 
measures, including data on all subjects who were randomized to the study group. This allows us  to use all 
available data, rather than delete participants with missing values f rom the analysis of treatment  effects.34   
Aim 4 : Cost -Effectiveness Analysis  
This aims to estimate the value of implementing Home PR compared to subjects referred to conventional PR.  
The CEA, will estimate the ratio of the average change of cost per patient divided by [CONTACT_210394]. QALYs will be based on the EQ - 
5D-3L35 using a preference -based value set derived from a sample of the US population. QALYs will be  
calculated by [CONTACT_210395] a number of time participants spent in a particular health state.  
Transitions between health states will be linearly interpolated. The perspective for the CEA is that of the  
healthcare provider.  
For both arms, all resource utilization at the health centers for the one -year period following index  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210366]. Estimated costs will be standardized using a bottom -up approach.  
Professional services defined by [CONTACT_569725]. Billed charges for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210367] -to-charge ratios based on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s annual Medicare cost report. All costs  
will be inflated to a common year using the Gross Domestic Product implicit price deflators.  
Multivariate regression models will be employed to control for differences between study groups. Due to the  
highly skewed nature of healthcare costs, a generalized linear model incorporating a gamma distribution and  
log-link function will be used. The cost -effectiveness of the home PR intervention will be determined using the  
threshold of $50,000/QALY. The 95% CI of the cost -effectiveness ratio will be calculated using nonparametric  
bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Healthcare utilization occurring at facilities outside of our network will not be captured. Sensitivity analysis of  
the cost -effectiveness will be performed based on residency status (local, regional, and distant).  
Limitations: We acknowledge that comparing to completed regular PR would be ideal, however, given that  the 
completion rate post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210368], accruing for such a study would be unrealistic. We strongly  
believe that the proposed design truly represents  “a real world” study and the result from it would be applicable  
to the practicing clinicians and regulatory agencies and payers to further support alternative  ways of PR (if our  
hypothesis is  confirmed: increased adherence, decreased readmission and patients’ critical outcomes like  
daily physical activity and quality of living).We will put a dedicated effort to motivate individual to attend  
conventional PR if they are randomized to arm.  
We will not know if the improvement in adherence is because of the home -based PR or health coaching.  
However, given that, only 4% complete conventional PR after a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a meaningful improvement in  
adherence would not require much effort from the patients the home -based PR program.

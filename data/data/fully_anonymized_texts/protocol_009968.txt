Purpose of Study     
• Primary Aim : To assess  if oral Methenamine Hippurate (MH) in combination w ith 
cranberry capsules is superior to cranberry  capsules  alone in prevention of UTI  in 
patients with transient post -operative urinary retention requiring a Foley catheter after 
pelvic reconstructive surgery.  
o Secondary Aim s:  
▪ To assess  patient adherence to  the interventions . 
▪ To assess patient satisfaction  associated with the different interventions . 
 
Hypothesis or Research Question  
• We hypothesize that  daily oral MH and cranberry  therapy will be a superior treatment 
to cranberry alone in the prevention of UTI in patients with  short term indwelling Foley  
catheters after pelvic reconstructive surgery.  
 
Background  
Urinary tract infections  (UTIs)  are one of the most common bacterial infections in women [1].  It 
is estimated that 1.6 b illion dollars are spent on UTI treatment  each year [ 2-3]. Escherichia  coli 
(E.coli ), a gram negative bacterium , is the most common pathogen found amongst those 
diagnosed with UTIs. Research suggests  that 70 -95% of UT Is are attributed to E.coli  which 
originates from intestinal microflora  [4-7]. Additionally, the more virulent strains of E.coli 
express  type 1 and p -fimbriae , which  aid in adhesion  to the urothelium  [8-12]. Antibiotics  have 
been the mainstay of treatment of UTIs, however frequent use has increased the prevalence of 
antibiotic resistant organisms [3 -4]. Therefore, focus has s hifted to  non-antibiotic therapy for 
UTI prophylaxis.  
 
Methenamine Hippurate (MH) has been studied  for decades due to its potential role  in 
prevention of UTI. While not technically an antibiotic, MH works via its  bacteriostatic  action in 
the bladder.  MH’s breakdown products include ammonium and formaldehyde  [13-15] which 
 
Template version: 10/16/[ADDRESS_508247] effective at a urine  pH below 5.5  [16-18].  Benefits of MH are the lack of development 
of resistance, and the selective nature of this drug to the urinary system only.  However, MH is 
best used in conjunction with an acidifying agent to increase its bioavailability (such as 
cranberry capsules or other acidic produ cts) [14-18]. 
 
The usage of MH has been studied in various populations, has been seen to be effective in 
short -term catheterization  [15]. One study by [CONTACT_403260], et. al revealed that in patients after 
gynecological surgery that required 24 hours of Foley cat heter placement had an incidence of 
UTI in 13.9% of patients with placebo versus 2.7% of patients using MH  [19]. Although there is 
some evidence of benefit, a Cochrane Database review revealed there was significant 
heterogeneity between studies and many of these studies vary in aspects such as definition of 
UTI and dosage  of MH . Many prior studies did not combine MH with an acidifying agent, which 
could also limit its efficacy  [14].  
 
The American cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon ) is another non -antibacterial agent which has 
been widely studied  [8]. Cranberries are composed of ingredients that include fructose, 
anthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins [ 8, 20 ]. These components are proposed to affect 
adhesion proteins that are expressed by [CONTACT_50904], such a s E.coli , and prevent the development 
of infection  [8, 20, 28 -30].   
 
Usage  of cranberry as prophylaxis for UTI is controversial;  however , results have been favorable 
in the post -operative gynecological population. One such study by  [CONTACT_403261]. revealed that 
the incidence of UTI was significantly lower in the cranberry than placebo group (19% versus 
38%) after undergoing gynecological surgery [ 32]. Additionally, the [ADDRESS_508248] lower rates of UTI than placebo (1 
of 3 versus 3 of 4, respectively) [ 32]. However, a study from our center revealed that r eal-time 
prescriptions of cranberry to postoperative patients with catheters did not significantly reduce 
UTI rates  [33].  
 
Post-operative urinary retention (POUR) occurs frequently in patients who undergo 
incontinence and pelvic prolapse surgery  [34-36]. Although the definition of POUR can vary 
between clinicians, it is reported as 2.5 -24% to as high as 43% after tension -free transvaginal 
mesh sling placement [ 34, 36, 37]. This popula tion is at also at high risk for UTI due to advanced 
age and menopausal status  [34, 38, 39]. Finally, using  a catheter longer than 2 days incurs a 2-
fold increased risk of development of UTI  with an estimated 5% increase in bacteriuria each day 
of catheterization [32, 34, 40-41].  
 
Moreover, a lthough t he incidence of UTI after pelvic reconstructive surge ry ranges from 10% to 
64% [ 42], a retrospective review performed at our institution  revealed our  incidence of UTI  was 
as high as 72% [33]. In hopes to decrease the overuse of antibiotics and decrease the li kelihood 
of antibiotic resistance, we propose that the use of MH  and cranberry  can reflect a potential 
benefit in this population of short -term indwelling Foley catheter use  and help reduce the 
incidence of post -operative UTI after pelvic surgery.  
    
 
Template version: 10/16/15  Research Plan  
• Study Design  
o Randomized double -blinded placebo -controlled  trial  
• Setting for the study  
o All patients will be approached for enrollment into the study if they fail their  
retrograde void trial  (VT) after major pelvic reconstructive surgery  for pelvic 
organ prolapse during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
o The patients will then be randomized to either receive cranberry capsules and 
placebo OR  cranberry capsules and  Methenamine Hippurate .  
o The research nurse will be blinded to the group allocation .  
o Patients will be instructed to take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] s assigned to them twice daily  until 
their repeat retrograde VT in the office  (6-8 days) . 
o A catheterized urine specimen will be then collected on the day of the 
retrograde void trial  on or about postoperative day [ADDRESS_508249] a clean -catch urine specimen 
during their routine postoperative visit and this will be recorded . 
o Patients’  charts will be followed until their [ADDRESS_508250] of 
care , based on the judgment of the treating provider .

Template version: 10/16/15  symptoms,  urine acidity (pH) , diagnosis of overactive bladder, post void 
residual  (PVR)  before surgery, POD1 and on or about POD7.   
• Intervention or experimental aspect of the study  
o All p atients of Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates who undergo pelvic organ 
prolapse repair(s) and have a retrograde  VT prior to discharge per  standard 
practice. The retrograde  VT will be performed by [CONTACT_60397]. Per protocol, 
up to 300ml sterile saline will be instilled into the bladder and the indwelling 
urinary catheter will be removed. Patients will be allotted [ADDRESS_508251] a label which will be generated by [CONTACT_403262], name [CONTACT_403268] , (Ex. 
Med A ) expi[INVESTIGATOR_403254].  
o These medications will be added onto their discharge instruc tions via a 
Medication Reconciliation on EPIC.  
o All subjects will be provided  all other routine prescriptions for pain medication, 
bowel regimen and instructions on how to administer the medication given.   
o Patients will be advised to take the medication r oughly at the same time each 
day with food to aid in absorption.  
o On or about POD7, the patient will be asked to return to the off ice for a repeat 
retrograde VT (as described above).  
o A catheterized urine specimen  will be collected on this visit and recorded.  
o If the patient fails the retrograde VT on or about POD7  they will have the 
catheter replaced. Additionally, they will be recommended to continue 
Cranberry supplementation  as per our current routine practices  until they return 
on their two -week po stoperative visit to repeat the retrograde VT (as described 
above). They will however not be asked to continue MH or the placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_403255].  
 
Template version: 10/16/15  o Patients will fill out  a questionnaire  based on the Medicine Acceptability 
Questionnaire as well as UTI  symptoms experienced and overall satisfaction [43].  
• Two -week  postoperative visit  
o All patients  will have a routine examination  at [ADDRESS_508252] urine  dip performed on the PVR urine sample. If positive for 
leukocyte esterase, white blood cells, or nitrites, the urine dip will be sent to the 
laboratory for culture. All urine culture results will be reviewed and if positive, 
will be treated and recorded.   
• Six-week  postoperative visit  
o All patients will be asked to present for routine 6-week  post -operative visit.  
 
• As per standard practice at our office, patients will be advised to  report symptoms 
such as dysuria, fever, flank pain, hematuria, frequency or urgency, cloudy urine, 
hematuria, or abdominal pain, .  During business hours they will be asked to call the 
office staff , while other times they will  page the on -call physician . 
• During operating hours, the office staff will arrange a clinic visit for the same day at 
one of four  outpatient clinics (Clifton, West Chester, Kenwood , Anderson ) and 
obtain a urine sample prior to the start of antibiotic therapy.  
• If not during office hours, the on -call staff will either direct the patient to a facility 
for urine collection prior to the start of antibiotic therapy, or if unable to do so, start 
antibiotic therapy based on clinical symptoms.  
• During any antibiotic therapy the patients will be advised to STOP all study 
medications  
• All of these encounters will be recorded.   
o Experimental oral capsules  
▪ Methenamine Hippurate  1g (1 tablet BID)  
• Contains Hippuric acid salt of Methenamine (hexamethylene 
tetramine), Magnesium Stearate, Povidone, Saccharin Sodium , 
FD&C Yellow No. 5 (Tartazine)  [44]. 
• >90% of methenamine is excreted in the urine within 24 hours 
after administration  [44].  
• Side effects are generally mild and are found in 3.3% of patients. 
These  include gastrointestinal upset, dysuria, abdominal cr amps , 
and rash  which are reversible  [44].  
• Sulfonamides are to b e used with caution with Methenamine as it 
has been shown that it concurrent use may cause a decrease in 
efficacy of the Methenamine by [CONTACT_403263]  [44]. 
▪ Placebo Pi[INVESTIGATOR_403256]: 10/16/15  ▪ Nature Made Super Strength Cranberry 450mg Extract  (1 Tablet BID)  
• Side effects are generally mild and include sto mach/abdominal 
upset, diarrhea. K idney stones  may occur but is associated with 
higher  high doses  [46]. 
• There have been case reports regarding hypercoagulability with 
high doses of Cranberry concomitant Warfarin therapy [4 7]. 
 
o Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)  [48] 
• Definition will include bacteriuria will be presence of bacteria at 
clinically relevant levels, or treatment with antibiotic for 
suspected UTI by a provider  
o Possible associated symptoms  patients may complain of 
include : dysuria, suprapubic pressure/pain, fever >100.4, 
urinary frequency or urgenc y.  
 
• Statistical Analysis  
o Descriptive statistics will be generated for demographic information such as age, 
race, BMI etc. Chi -squared te st or Fisher’s exact test will be employed to 
examine the difference in categorical variables  between two groups.  A Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -
Wilk test will be performed for testing normality. To test the difference in 
continuous variables between two groups, Student t -test or a Mann -Whitney 
test will be used. A Logistic regression will be implemented to calculate the odds 
ratio and corresponding confidence interval for comparing the incidence of UTI 
between two groups.  
 
Ethical Considerations  
• Informed consent  
o Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign a written informed 
consent. They will be consented by [CONTACT_403264] a copy of the signed informed consent 
statements (ICS). A copy wi ll be put in their medical file.

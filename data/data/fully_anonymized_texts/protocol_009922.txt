Loop diuretic therapy is the cornerstone of heart failure (HF) symptom management.  Symptoms 
of fluid retention and congestion are responsible for 90% of HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and almost all 
(86% - 97%) patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186585] (IV ) loop diuretics.1,2-4  The 
incidence of diuretic resistance is unknown, given the lack of a consensus definition, but 
resistance is reported to occur in 25 -35% of heart failure patients. 5-7 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_186586], guidelines by [CONTACT_186608] (HFSA) and the American College  of Cardiology Foundation/American 
Heart Association  (ACCF/AHA) provide nonspecific guidance on diuretic  regimen design in 
response to diuretic resist ance. Both guidelines recommend (LOE IIA, Class B) the addition of a 
second type of diuretic (options listed include oral metolazone and intravenous chlorothiazide). 8,9 
As expected, 57% of physician questions about advanced HF management in a recent surve y 
concerned diuretic titration.10 
 
Addition of a second diuretic is a common practice to overcome diuretic resistance, despi[INVESTIGATOR_186587]. A 2010 literature review of combining thiazide and 
loop diuretics found, “ The aggregate body of literature is limited by [CONTACT_186609], 
study design with lack of control groups, heterogeneous patient populations, wide variation in 
diuretic regimens, and focus on physiologic rather than clinical outcomes.”[ADDRESS_220500] of 
combination diuretic regimens, predisposing patie nts to cardiac arrhythmias. 11 Furthermore, each 
agent has it limitations: metolazone is subjected to erratic absorption due to its oral dosage form; 
whereas, intravenous chlorothiazide over comes the absorption issue but is more costly.12-[ADDRESS_220501] (Efficacy of 
Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan) trials the addition of 
30 mg tolvaptan daily was evaluated compared to IV lo op diuretics in > 4,[ADDRESS_220502] day, and weights at 
discharge or day 7 were 0.6 kg lower in trial A and 0.9 kg lower in trial B (p <  .001). Most 
notably, no study reported hypok alemia with the combination of loop diuretics and tolvaptan.15-17 
Another study demonstrated that 80mg furosemide plus 30mg of tolvaptan provided a reducing of 
1.48kg (± 1.14kg) at [ADDRESS_220503] pros pective trials comparing three 
different medications in addition to loop diuretics. By [CONTACT_14662] a prescriptive algorithm for loop 
diuretic dosing and other medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_186588], the study will address 
many of the limitations of p revious studies such as the lack of a control group, retrospective 
design, and wide variations of both loop and thiazide diuretic regimens.13, 14 Metolazone will be 
 
Protocol Version  #: 6  4 
Protocol Date: 10/27/[ADDRESS_220504] -of-care thiazide to mirror current clinical perceptions and to rep licate a 
recent landmark diuretic study’s thiazide use.11, [ADDRESS_220505] intravenous chlorothiazide will require equivalent cumulative potassium repletion at 48 
hours compared to oral metolazone. Hypokalemia as not been reported with the combination of 
tolvaptan a nd loop diuretics, likely due to tolvaptan’s distinctive mechanism of action. We expect 
tolvaptan will require less cumulative potassium repletion at [ADDRESS_220506] -of-care oral metolazone when combined with standardized loop diuretic 
dosing for diuretic resistance in acute heart failure  
The average wholesale price for one dose of each agent according to Redbook online is $1.50, 
$357, and $[ADDRESS_220507] difference of tolvaptan tablets compared to 
metolazone tablets.

Protocol Date: 10/27/2017 4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
We will conduct a single  center, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, parallel design trial 
comparing oral metolazone, intravenous chlorothiazide, and oral tolvaptan in combination with 
loop diuretics in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186593]. The duration o f the 
study will be [ADDRESS_220510] dose of the study thiazide or tolvaptan medication. 
Vanderbilt University Medical center will be the study  site. IRB approval will be obtained from 
the Vanderbilt Univeristy Medical Center IRB .  
 
All patients wil l provide informed consent prior to enrollment. After enrollment, a ll patients will 
be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_220511] of Care Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_186594] a 2L/day fluid restriction and a 2g/day sodium restriction. 
Decisions regarding the initiation, titration, or discontinuation of standard heart failure 
medications (ACEI, ARB, Aldosterone Antagonists, Beta Blockers, digoxin,  hydralazine, 
nitrates) are left to the discretion of the treating physicians.  All electrolyte repletion, loop diuretic 
dose titration, and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_186595]’s discretion.  
To prevent conf ounding heterogeneity in the diuretic treatment approach, a stepped care 
algorithm similar to the CARRESS -HF19 trial will be utilized for loop diuretics, both initial doses 
and subsequent dose changes, and for concomitant inotropes and vasodilators. The st epped care 
algorithm and the initial diuretic treatment regimen are delineated in Study Flow Diagram below. 
A minimum furosemide equivalent dose of 580mg/24hrs (100mg IV bolus + 20mg/hr infusion 
rate) must be ordered at enrollment.  
 
5.2 Randomization  
All patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion at VUMC using an electronic randomization 
tool embedded in REDCAP.  Patients will be randomized to either : 
1) intravenous chlorothiazide 500mg IV Q12H +  an oral placebo capsule Q12H  
2) intravenous  placebo infusion Q12H + a capsule containing oral metolazone 5mg PO 
Q12H  
3) intravenous placebo infusion Q12H + a capsule containing oral tolvaptan 30mg once 
daily and placebo capsule in the evening dose.  
 
(Relative potency21, 22: Metolazone 100 fold more potent than chlorothiazide)

Protocol Version #: 6 
Protocol Date: 10/27/2017  10 6.0 Risks  
This study will evaluate the addition of an oral thiazide, intravenous thiazide, or tolvaptan to 
augment intravenous loop diuretic therapy in patients with  hypervolemic decompensated heart 
failure and diuretic resistance to adequately dosed loop diuretic monotherapy. Augmentation of 
loop diuretic therapy with a second diuretic (commonly a thiazide) is considered the standard -of-
care in diuretic resistance an d is endorsed by [CONTACT_34129]/ACCF and HFSA guidelines.8,[ADDRESS_220514] study evaluated 4,133 patients with decompensated heart failure randomized to 
placebo or tolvaptan for 60 days. The in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186598] (6.5%) and placebo (5.5%). The most common adverse effects of tolvaptan  in these 
trials have been thirst (16%), dry mouth (8.4%), and polyuria. Hypernatermia occurred in 1.7% of 
tolvaptan patients vs 0.5% of placebo patients. Acute kidney injury, hypotension, and potassium 
derangements are not associated with tolvaptan therap y. As our duration of study is only [ADDRESS_220515] diuresis augmentation with a thiazide.  
Hypernatremia/Over -correction of Serum Sodium  
While hyponatremia is not the target population of this study, patients with a serum sodium range 
of 130 -145mEq/L are eligible to participate. Relative to the thiazide arm, patients with 
hyponatremia randomized to tolvaptan are at the unique, albeit rare, risk of over -correctio n of 
serum sodium. Overcorrection of sodium is commonly defined as an increase in serum sodium by 
[CONTACT_726] 12mEq/L in [ADDRESS_220516] likely to occur when 
the serum sodium is < 125mEq/L at baseline, which is an exclusion c riterion of our study.  The 
SALT studies included patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135mEq/L) from various 
disease states, including heart failure.  Only 5 patients (2.2%) of patients experienced a rise if 
serum sodium > 12mEq/L during any [ADDRESS_220517] developed 
osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). The FDA package insert for tolvaptan records that cases 
of ODS have occurr ed in post -marketing surveillance. In our study, we will only randomize 20 
patients to tolvaptan, calculating to 1 -2 patients with hyponatremia being randomized to 
tolvaptan. The low rate of overcorrection in literature, small sample size, exclusion criter ia 
(sodium < 130 mEq/L, advanced liver disease, severe malnutrition), short duration of therapy in 
our trial, and twice daily serum sodium monitoring makes the risk of a patient experiencing 
overcorrection of serum sodium low in our study. All patients will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186599].  
To minimize this risk, patients who are at highest risk of ODS at enrollment (serum sodium < 
130mEq/L) will receive a serum sodium assessment [ADDRESS_220518] udy diuretic. 
If the serum sodium increases > 8mEq/L from baseline at 12 hours, the will receive protocolized 
management to prevent ODS.  
1) Intravenous D5W at 3ml/kg/hr  
2) Repeat serum sodium every 2 hours  
3) Neurologic monitoring for symptoms such as speech dist urbances, altered mental status, 
and seizure activity  
4) D5W and every 2 hour serum sodium labs will be continued until the serum sodium is < 
8mEq/L above baseline sodium  
Patients will continue the loop diuretic therapy during this protocol. If the patient d oes not

medication administration. All patients will be followed per the study protocol through Day 30.  
Hepatic toxicity  
Hepatotoxicity occurred in 3 patients in the TEMPO study, which evaluated the effects of 
Tolvaptan 60 -120mg daily in a polycystic kidney disease patient population. In all 3 patients, the 
hepatic toxicity occurred after 3 months of therapy and resolved wit h tolvaptan discontinuation. 
Our study protocol will exclude patients with advanced liver disease, consistent with the updated 
FDA package labeling recommendations, and will administer a lower dose for only 48 hours.  
 
 
Thiazides (Metolazone or Chlorothiaz ide) 
In accordance with previous trials evaluating combination thiazide and loop diuretics (DOSE, 
CARRESS -HF), the metabolic risks include gout, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. The risks 
include: h yponatremia , hypokalemia , gout flare/attack, and c ardiac arrhythmias . In the 
CARRESS -HF study, ultrafiltration was compared to a step -wise diuretic protocol in 188 patients 
with hypervolemic, decompensated heart failure and worsening renal function. Of the 94 patients 
in the diuretic arm, 46% of participants receiv ed metolazone therapy. Only 3 (3%) patients 
experienced an electrolyte disorder, which included hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and 
hyperuricemia.  Arrhythmic events were not specifically reported. A retrospective comparison of 
intravenous and oral thiazide diu retics found the rate of hypokalemia, defined as a serum 
potassium < 4mEq/L, to be 71% in the oral thiazide group and 83% in the intravenous thiazide 
group.[ADDRESS_220521] of care 
practice.  
 
7.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants 
or Others  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is an adverse event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186600]  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure  
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening,  
or prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186601].  Example of 
such medical events include: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific 
judgment must be exercised when classifying events as serious.  
 
The det ermination of adverse event severity rests on medical judgment of a medically qualified 
investigator. The severity of SAEs will be graded using the following definitions:  
Protocol Version #: 6 
Protocol Date: 10/27/2017  12 • Mild : awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated;  
• Moderate : discomfor t enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant 
intervention;  
• Severe : incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical 
status, and warrants intervention.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_220522] assess the relationship of any SAE to the use of study 
drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
Possibly Related  - There is a reasonable possibility that the adve rse event may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_5257]. The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug administration 
makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying 
conditions do not provide sufficien t explanation for the observed event.  
Not Possibly Related - It is unlikely that the event was caused by [CONTACT_5257]. The temporal 
relationship of the adverse event to the study drug administration makes causal relationship 
unlikely and other drugs, ther apeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a more likely 
explanation for the event.  
Expectedness  - The expectedness of an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction shall be 
determined according to the package insert for U.S. marketed furosemi de and tolvaptan. Any AE 
that is not identified in nature, severity, or specificity in the current U.S. package insert is 
considered unexpected. Events described in the U.S. package insert as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharm acological properties of the drug, but not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation are considered unexpected.  
 
7.2 Reporting of SAE  
All serious adverse events occurring from r andomization through the 30 day follow -up period 
will be collected. The Site Investigator is responsible for monitoring the  safety of patients 
enrolled into the study. The following adverse events  are anticipated, disease related -events in 
patients with decompensated heart failure however they s hould still be reported on the Serious 
Adverse Event form in the REDCAP Database (some  may require reporting as study endpoints):  
• New Atrial Arrhythmia : A “new” diagnosis of atrial arrhythmia (includes atrial 
fibrillation, atrial flutter, ectopic atrial ta chycardia) lasting > 30 seconds OR any atrial 
arrhythmia which causes hemodynamic instability (MAP < 60 and requiring intervention)  
• New Ventricular Arrhythmia : Ventricular tachycardia lasting longer than 30 seconds, or 
frequent non -sustained VT causing hemodynamic instability with MAP < 60 mmHg 
requiring intervention or > 1 intra -cardiac defibrillation or external cardiac defibrillation 
shock or ventricular fibrillation requiring defibrillation  
• Hypotension : SBP < [ADDRESS_220523] 
30 minutes or symptomatic hypotension necessitating clinical intervention (defined as 
vasopressor support, intravenous fluid boluses, or initiation of inotropes)  
• Myocardial infarction : a cardiac event including an elevat ion in troponin above baseline 
with our without ECG changes that is judged to be a myocardial infarction by [CONTACT_186614]  
• Cardiac arrest : any ventricular arrhythmic or pulseless electrical event that requires 
immediate life -sustaining  medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Acute renal failure : A rise is serum creatinine of 1mg/dl or more from the baseline serum 
creatinine in the 48 hour treatment period  
• Acute renal failure  requiring dialysis : an acute renal failure event that began during the 
48 hour study  period and necessitates new hemodialysis during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186602] #: 6 
Protocol Date: 10/27/2017  13 • Worsening heart failure : the need for rescue therapy (additional open label loop diuretic,  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_186592] >75mg/day, eplerenone > 75mg/day, non -study thiazides (at a dose 
of metolaz one 2.5mg or greater equivalence) , systemic acetazolamide (for diuretic 
indication), tri amterene, amiloride, ultrafiltration, hemodialysis, or mechanical 
circulatory or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]) in the 48 hour treatment period  
• Death  
• Metabolic SAE (during 48 hour treatment period):  
o Severe Hypokalemia : Serum potassium value < 3.0mEq/L  
o Severe Hyponatremia : Serum sodium value < 130mEq/L and a decrease of 
5mEq/L or more from enrollment serum sodium  
o Overcorrection of serum sodium : increase in serum sodium from baseline by 
>12mEq/L in 24 hours, increase in >8mEq/L in 12 hours, or receipt of 
intravenous fluids because of symptoms of overcorrection of serum sodium 
regardless of the numerical rise  
o Hyperkalemia: serum potassium value >  5.5mEq/L  
o Gout:  acute gout attack requiring treatment with an anti -inflammatory agent  
 
All serious adverse events must be recorded in the Serious Adverse Event Record of the  
patient’s REDCAP database . All serious adverse events should be monitored until s tabilization or  
resolution.  
 
Reporting to Local IRB . Investigators are also responsible for promptly reporting unexpected 
adverse  events (serious and non serious) to their reviewing IRB in accordance with local  
requirements.  The Vanderbilt investigational site will report DSM reports to the Vanderbilt IRB 
annually at the time of co ntinuing review at a minimum. If  [ADDRESS_220524] at the end of the study.  
 
7.3 Study Termination  
The study may be terminated based on review of serious  adverse events and unexpected events. If 
5 unexpected SAEs  occur this will trigger a temp orary halt to the study until  additional review of 
these events is conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_32397] . 
 
8.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
A patient may withdraw at the study at anytime. The patient will inform the site investigator of 
their desire to withdraw. All  study -based therapy will stop at this point, and the attending 
cardiologist will perform any further care. All study data collected to that time point will be 
included in the analysis. The withdrawal reason will be documented.  
The site investigator will withdraw patients requiring therapy for overcorrection of serum sodium 
who experience any neurologic symptoms or who do not respond to intravenous D5W therapy 
within 6 hours. All patients will be followed per the study protocol through Day 30.  
 
9.0 Statistical  Considerations  
9.1 Sample Size  
Protocol Version #: 6 
Protocol Date: 10/27/[ADDRESS_220525] statistical methods that allow our study to be realistic and achievable. Power 
calculations are difficult because of the lack of prospective trials comparing combination diuretic 
therapy and the numerous flaws in the methods of these previo us studies. We will utilize change 
in weight as the primary outcome because weight change has been utilized as a primary efficacy 
outcome in landmark heart failure diuretic trials (CARRESS -HF19) and has less standard 
deviation than net urine output. In pre vious studies standard deviation of weight loss changes 
between groups varied with an approximate value of 1.6kg.14, [ADDRESS_220526] 
the null hypot hesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal 
with 82.3% power.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis 
is 0.05.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_220527] which both 
chlorothiazide an d tolvaptan treatment arms will be individually compared. Parametric 
continuous variables will be presented as mean (standard deviation) and non -parametric 
continuous variables will be presented as median (interquartile range). Nominal data will be 
present ed as the number (percentage). We will employ a student’s t test for the independent 
continuous primary outcome variable  and other secondary outcomes  using metolazone as the 
comparison group for both intravenous chlorothiazide and oral tolvaptan. For secon dary 
outcomes, of which metolazone will again be the comparison group, fisher’s exact test  will be 
used for secondary outcomes that are nominal data . A two tailed p -value of less than or equal to 
0.05 will be considered significant.  
 
10.0 Privacy/Confidentialit y Issues  
 
All study protocols and procedures will be submitted to the site’s Institutional Review Board for 
approval. All data collected will be stored in a secure REDCAP database, accessible only by [CONTACT_186615]. The following identifying informati on will be collected: age, medical record 
number, admission date, and discharge date. Patient -reported congestion score surveys will be de -
identified, using a study identification number. All patient -reported congestion score surveys and 
consent forms and will be stored in a locked cabinet in the site investigator's office. For statistical 
analyses, all identifying information will be removed. Candidates aged > [ADDRESS_220528] 12 months. All records will be stored in a secure REDCAP 
database.

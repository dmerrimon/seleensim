Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection, with a prevalence of approximately 
1% in the [LOCATION_002], translating into 44,[ADDRESS_838094] been diagnosed with primary CMV infection during early 
pregnancy. 
1.3 Purpose of the S tudy Protocol  
This protocol describes the background, design and organization of the randomized clinical trial and may 
be viewed as a written agreement among the study investigators.  The Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) and the Network Advisory Board review the protocol.  Before recruitment begins, 
the protocol is approved by [CONTACT_22443] (NICHD) Maternal -Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network Steering Committee, and the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of each clinical center.  Any changes to the protocol during the study 
period require the approval of the Steering Committee and the IRBs; major changes also require the 
approval of the DSMC.  
A manual of operations supplements the protocol with detailed specificat ions of the study procedures. 
  
November  01, 2017  
2 2 Background  
2.1 Burden of CMV disease  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection.  Between 1 and 4% of seronegative 
pregnant women will seroconvert (have a primary infection) during pregnancy.  With a prevalence of 
approximately 1% in the [LOCATION_002] , it is estimated that 44,[ADDRESS_838095] 400 children die each year from this disease, and up to 8,000 develop permanent 
disabilities.  Congenital CMV accounts for 20 -30% of cases of congenital hearing loss, and is a leading 
cause of hearing loss in the U.S.  Congenital CMV affects more children than other conditions that have 
routine screening, such as trisomy 21 and spi[INVESTIGATOR_113163].  Unlike these conditions, however, congenital 
CMV infection is potentially preventable during the antepartum period.   
Following maternal primary CMV infection, approximately 40% of fetuses will acquire CMV infection in 
utero.  Those inf ected in the first trimester are much more severely affected.  A third of congenitally 
infected neonates are born prematurely. At birth, 10- 15% of congenitally infected neonates will have 
symptoms such as microcephaly, petechiae, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly , jaundice, pneumonitis, 
encephalitis, seizures and low birth weight. Of these symptomatic infants, 6% will die, mostly from 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatic dysfunction or bacterial superinfection.  Approximately 
90% of those with clinicall y apparent infection at birth will develop sequelae, such as bilateral hearing 
loss, chorioretinitis or severe developmental delay.  The likelihood of survival with normal intellect and hearing after symptomatic congenital CMV infection is small.
1  Of the 85-90% of infants that are 
asymptomatic at birth, 10- 15% will develop permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, optic atrophy, 
developmental delay, spastic diplegia or quadriplegia by [ADDRESS_838096] of 
caring for these childre n is one to two billion dollars.  
Additionally, congenitally infected neonates continue to excrete large quantities of virus in their urine and 
saliva, for up to 6 years or perhaps longer.  This long -term excretion contributes to the spread of infection, 
thus amplifying the public health burden.  
2.2 Potential for P revention of Congenital Disease 
Administration of hyperimmune globulin (HIG) to prevent congenital CMV infection has been successful 
in an animal model (guinea pig) in reducing both fetal infection as well as fetal effects such as growth 
restriction.  Proposed mechanisms of action include immunomodulatory effects, reduction of viral load, 
and /or decreased placental inflammation.[ADDRESS_838097] been shown to be at 
decreased risk of transfusion -associated CMV infection compared to neonates born to mothers without 
prior CMV infection, which suggests that maternal CMV antibodies that cross the placenta are 
protective.3  As part of a proof of concept study, Nigro and colleagues studied the use of CMV 
hyperimmune globulin in 84 women who had a primary CMV infection at less than 21 weeks’ gestation, or who declined amniocentesis following a primary CMV infection.
4  They were offered monthly HIG 
(100U/kg) infusions until delivery as preventive therapy, and 37 women accepted therapy.  Those who 
received HIG had a significantly lower rate of congenitally infected neonates (40% vs 16%; P=0.02).  
Severe symptomatic neonatal infections were noted in 3 of 19 infected infants whose mothers did not 
receive HIG compared with none of the 6 infected infants whose mothers received HIG (P=NS).[ADDRESS_838098] of a randomized, prospective, placebo- controlled trial.5 Revello and colleagues conducted a 
randomized trial and the final results were recently publish ed in the New England Journal of Medicine .  
The researchers concluded that among the 124 women randomized in the study, “treatment with 
November  01, 2017  
3 hyperimmune globulin did not significantly modify the course of primary CMV infection during 
pregnancy”.   However, the s tudy suggested a hint of benefit with a 30% congenital infection rate in the 
hyperimmune globulin group versus 44% in the placebo group (p= 0.13). The publication also raised a 
potential safety issue of preterm birth  with a 13% rate of preterm delivery, pr eeclampsia, and fetal growth 
restriction in the hyperimmune globulin group versus 2% in the placebo group (p= 0.06).[ADDRESS_838099] year.
11  In this study, more than 18,000 women were screened to identify 
4,509 seronegative subjects, of whom only 464 underwent randomization. The trial was stopped due to a 
vaccine efficacy of 50%  (95% CI 7 to 73).  While the primary outcome for this trial was maternal CMV 
infection, a trial to evaluate protection of symptomatic congenital infection would require the enrollment 
of more than 50,000 women with an assumed 50% rate of vaccine efficacy.[ADDRESS_838100] been reported. Preparations are manufactured 
using pooled human plasma from screened donors. The preparations are highly purified polyvalent IgG (>90%) produced by [CONTACT_628890]. 
Preparative techniques of immunoglobulin purification remove relevant transfusion- related viruses (HIV, 
hepatitis). Contraindications to therapy include known hypersensitivity to immune globulin or IgA 
deficiency . 
Cytomegalovirus immune gl obulin (CMVIG) is prepared from IgG antibodies derived from pooled 
healthy, adult donors with high antibody titers to CMV. Cytogam®, from CSL Behring, is the only 
commercially available CMV specific hyperimmune globulin preparation licensed in the United S tates. It 
is FDA approved for use in CMV prophylaxis in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_628880]. These patients are immunosuppressed and at risk for 
invasive CMV disease. Clinical trials have dem onstrated the efficacy of CMVIG in preventing CMV 
disease in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
13   
At usual dosing ranges (50- 150 mg/kg), there are few reported side effects from CMVIG infusions.  A 
prospective randomized trial of 99 transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_628881].  Forty women were excluded after randomization leaving 59 women in the final analysis.  Twelve percent of the 59 patients (24 CMVIG, 35 placebo) and 6% of the [ADDRESS_838101] reported was flushing.13  The 24 patients given CMVIG were pooled 
with an open- label study of 36 patients.  Side effects were repor ted in 18 (30%) patients and 5.2% of the 
[ADDRESS_838102] 
of the re actions were rate related and could be eliminated by [CONTACT_1743].  A randomized 
trial of 146 patients reported 17 (23%) in the CMVIG group compared with 8 (11%) in the placebo group 
(1% albumin) developed a possible reaction (p=0.08).15  Possible reactions were noted in 6.7 % of the 
CMVIG infusions and 3.8% of placebo infusions and in only one patient was the effect severe enough to warrant discontinuation of the infusion due to hemolysis.   
There are several other human immune globulin products in clinical use and similar cautions are advised 
with the use of Cytogam® that have been extrapolated from the use of such products. Cytogam® should 
be used with caution in people with a history of renal dysfuncti on or volume depletion.
[ADDRESS_838103] been reported with human immune globulin infusion products include 
anaphylaxis, aseptic meningiti s, thrombotic events, hemolysis, and transfusion- related acute lung injury 
(TRALI).  These severe side effects have been noted in case reports of older patients with medical 
complications and at much higher doses.  In the studies discussed above, there wer e only 2 reports of 
severe effects that required discontinuation (1 allergic reaction, 1 hemolysis).  The incidence of minor 
side effects such as flushing, chills, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia and 
wheezing were less than 6. 0% of all infusions and are most often related to infusion rates.[ADDRESS_838104] sold as Cytogam® is pregnancy category C. There were no adverse maternal or fetal events reported in the one study conducted in pregnant women in which 
68 women received CMV hyperimmune globulin (31 received 200 U/kg and 37 received 100 U/kg). 
4  
2.4 Rationale for a Randomized Clinical Trial 
In large part due to the difficulties encountered with serologic screening and diagnosis, as well as the lack of effective preventive strategies following maternal infection, screening for CMV in the U.S. has been 
limited to those women at high risk due to  occupational exposure and/or ultrasound abnormalities.   
Serologic screening for CMV infection in the first trimester is a common practice in Europe, and recent 
developments have made CMV screening with subsequent maternal therapy to prevent fetal infecti on 
feasible.  These include the development of CMV IgG avidity testing, with low avidity antibody suggesting recent infection, and publication of an observational study of the use of CMV hyperimmune 
globulin to prevent fetal infection following maternal CM V infection (and to treat documented fetal 
infection).
4  
A trial may establish the feasibility of widespread screening for primary CMV infection during 
pregnancy, thus changing the practice of prenatal care in the [LOCATION_002].  A prospective trial, if the null 
hypothesis is proved, may also prevent ineffective and unnecessary treatment of pregnant women with an 
expensive therapy.  In summary, due to the large public health, emotional and financial burden of this 
common disease, improved serologic methods for detecting maternal primary CMV infection,  a promising (but unproved)  intervention for the interruption of intrauterine transmission, and the current 
lack of an effective vaccine, a well designed, conducted, and anal yzed clinical trial is needed.  
 
 
 
 
November  01, [ADDRESS_838105] congenital CMV transmission, as the risk of 
congenital CMV transmission is reduced from 40% in the absence of preexisting maternal immunity to 
<2% in mothers with preexisting anti -CMV immunity.   Moreover, disease severity in the infant is highly 
ameliorated in the setting of preexisting maternal immunity.   High -avidity maternal antibody responses 
have previously been demonstrated to modul ate the risk of fetal transmission, however the epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]-
specificity and functions of protective antibodies have not been established.  Moreover, there is limited 
knowledge of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specificity of CMV -specific antibodies that can neutralize circulatin g CMV 
strains.   In addition, it is well -established that CMV -specific cellular immune responses are required for 
containment of CMV replication, and thus are likely to play a role in protection against congenital CMV 
transmission.   The presence of potent f unctional anti -CMV antibody responses and strong CMV -specific 
cellular immune response may correlate with a decreased risk of congenital CMV transmission.   Defining 
protective maternal immune responses in this trial will provide immunologic targets for des ign and 
evaluation of candidate maternal CMV vaccines.

6 3 Study Design  
3.1 Primary Research  Question  
This study will address the primary research question: does maternal administration of CMV 
hyperimmune globulin lower the rate of congenital CMV infection among the offspring of women who 
have been diagnosed with primary CMV infection during early pregnancy?  
3.2 Secondary Research Questions  
Secondary research questions this study will address are:  
• Does CMV hyperimmune globulin prevent or lessen the se verity of sequelae of CMV infection as 
assessed at the age of two?  
• Does CMV hyperimmune globulin affect neurodevelopmental level as determined by [CONTACT_628891]?  
• Does viral load measured in maternal blood predict adverse neonatal outcome or response to 
CMV hyperimmune globulin?    
• Does maternal humoral and  cellular immune response protect against  congenital CMV 
transmission ? 
 
3.[ADDRESS_838106] system before 23 weeks’ 
gestation will be randomized to one of two monthly treatments:  
• IV CMV hyperimmune globulin  at a dose of 100mg/kg  current body weight  
• Identical appearing placebo consisting of IV Albumin 5% diluted in a solution of dextrose in 
water,  ( with matching volume ).  Albumin allows the placebo t o have a “foamy” appearance 
similar to the active drug.  
3.4 Eligibility Criteria  
3.4.1 Inclusion Criteri a 
1. Diagnosis of primary maternal CMV infection  is defined as one of the following:  
• A positive CMV IgM antibody  (≥ 1.00 Index)  and low -avidity maternal CMV IgG anti body 
screen  (< 50.0%)  
• Evidence of maternal seroconversion with development of CMV IgG antibody  (≥ 6.0 AU/ml)  
following a prior negative CMV screen  (< 6.0 AU/ml)  
The CMV IgG, IgM, and IgG avidity are measured on the Abbott Architect system .  The 
sensitivities and specificities for the three assays range from 97 -100%.  The IgG avidity which 
determines a primary infection has a specificity of 100%.[ADDRESS_838107] ultrasound as described in “Gestational Age Determination” in Section 
3.4.2 below ; or  
3. Gestational age at randomization no later than  276 weeks  for the following:   
• Women with a positive IgM  and negative IgG , initially screened before [ADDRESS_838108] evidence of IgG seroconversion   
• Women with initially negative IgM and negative IgG , rescreened after [ADDRESS_838109] occur within six weeks of the blood draw for the qualifying screening 
sample.  
5. Singleton pregnancy .   A twin pregnancy reduced to singleton (either spontaneously or 
therapeutically) before [ADDRESS_838110] gestational age (see Section 3.4.2 below) is 
acceptable.  
3.4.2 Gestational Age Determination  
Gestational age is determined using criteria proposed by [CONTACT_628892], the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine and the Society for Maternal -Fetal 
Medi cine and is denoted “project gestational age”.17  The “project EDC”, which is based on the project 
gestational age, cannot be revised once a determination  has been made.  In the case of in-vitro 
fertilization, project gestational age is calculated from the date of embryo transfer  and the embryo age at 
transfer.   
The following algorithm is used:  
1. The first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) is determined, and a judgment made as to 
whether or  not the patie nt has a “sure” LMP date.  
2. If the LMP date is unsur e, the ultrasound measurements obtained at the patient’ s first dating 
ultrasound examination are used to determine the project gestational age .  If the first dating 
ultrasound was conducted before [ADDRESS_838111] be based on crown 
rump length (CRL).   
3. If the LMP  date  is sure, project gestational age is determined by a comparison between the 
gestational age by [CONTACT_85651].   
• If the earliest dating ultrasound confirms the  gestational age by [CONTACT_628893]1 below , the LMP -derived  gestational age is used to determine the 
project gestational age.  
• If the ultrasound determined gestational age does not confirm the LMP generated gestational 
age within the number of days specified in Table 1, the ultrasound is used to determine the 
project gestational age.   
 
         
November  01, [ADDRESS_838112] ultrasound by [CONTACT_628894] 8 weeks 6 days  CRL ± 5 days  
9 weeks 0 days to 13 weeks 6 days  CRL ± 7 days  
14 weeks 0 days to 15 weeks 6 days  Per institution  ± 7 days  
16 weeks 0 days to 21 weeks 6 days  Per institution  ± 10 days  
22 weeks 0 days to 27 weeks 6 days  Per institution  ± 14 days  
3.4.3 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Maternal CMV infection pre- dating pregnancy as defined by a high IgG avidity index or a 
positive IgG in the presence of a negative IgM.  
2. Known hypersensitivity to plasma or plasma derived products  
3. Planned termination of pregnancy 
4. Known major fetal anomalies or demise  
5. Maternal IgA deficiency , because of the potential for developi[INVESTIGATOR_628882] a maternal anaphylactic reaction to subsequent administration of b lood products 
containing IgA , including Cytogam ®. 
6. Planned  use of immune globulin, ganciclovir , or valganciclovir  
7. Maternal renal disease ( most recent pre- randomization serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL; all women 
must have serum creatinine measured during the p regnancy  and prior to randomization) , because 
IV immune globulin products have been reported to be associated with renal dysfunction.   
8. Maternal immune impairment (e.g., HIV infection, organ transplant on anti -rejection 
medications) , because this may require use of IV  immune globulin products  
9. Findings on pre -randomization ultrasound suggestive of established fetal CMV infection (cerebral 
ventriculomegaly , microcephaly, cerebral or intra -abdominal calcifications, abnormalities of 
amniotic fluid volume , echogenic bowel or ascities) .  Abnormally low  amniotic fluid volume is 
defined as no fluid prior to 14 weeks or maximum vertical pocket < 2  cm on or after 14 weeks 
gestation.  Abnormally high amniotic fluid volume is defined as > 10 cm.  
10. Positive fetal CMV  findings from culture (amniotic fluid) or PCR.  
11. Congenital infection with rubella, syphilis, varicella, parvovirus  or toxoplasmosis diagnosed by 
[CONTACT_628895] . 
12. Intention of the patient or of the managing obstetricians fo r the delivery to be outside a  MFMU 
Network center , unless protocol subcommittee approval is obtained for that specific delivery 
location, which will be conditional on special provisions being made to ensure collection of 
samples to determine the primary o utcome , and IRB approval at the delivery hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
13. Participation in another interventional study that influences fetal or neonatal morbidity/mortality 
or developmental outcome  
14. Unwilling or unable to commit to [ADDRESS_838113] be obtained from patients before they can be screened for the study by 
[CONTACT_628896] (IgM, IgG, and IgG  avidity).  Patients who are eligible for the study as a result of the 
screening will be asked to sign another cons ent form to participate in the trial.  Full disclosure of the 
nature and potential risks of participating in the trial is to be made.   
Each center will develop its own consent forms according to the requirements of its own institutional review board using  the model consent forms in Appendix B.  Each center will also develop its own 
patient research authorization documents, as required by [CONTACT_36869], following the 
guidelines of its own institution.  A copy of the signed screening consent form and, if applicable, the 
consent form for the study will be provided to the patient.   
Women who are not fluent in English will be enrolled by a person fluent in their language.  Both verbal 
and written informed consent and authorization will be obtained in t hat language; if this is not possible 
the patient will be excluded.  
3.6 Randomization Method and Masking 
Consenting women will be assigned to one of the two treatment groups by [CONTACT_16018]’s pharmacist, who is 
not masked, according to  a randomization sequence p repared and maintained centrally by [CONTACT_628897] (BCC).  The active and placebo study medication will be prepared at 
the center’s pharmacy  according to the randomization sequence.  The study is double masked; neither the 
patient n or the clinical staff will be aware of the treatment assignment .     
The simple urn method will be used to generate the randomization sequences because it provides a high 
probability of balance in treatment assignments, it is unpredictable, and i t allows an explicit 
randomization analysis18,[ADDRESS_838114] to anticipated differences in 
the clinic populations and  possible differences in patient management.
November  01, 2017  
10 4 Study Procedures  
4.1 Screening for Eligibility  and Consent  
All women presenting for prenatal care before approximately 23 weeks gestational age without a known 
multif etal gestation are eligible for CMV  screening.  Prior to testing, if a patient appears to meet the 
criteria for screening, she will be told about the study and asked to sign an informed consent form for 
screening (see Appendix B.1  for the model screening consent form).  All women who are sc reened will be 
provided with the CDC guidelines for prevention of CMV.  
Five ml of blood is required for the screening  CMV test .  The blood preferably will be drawn at the same 
time that blood is drawn for routine prenatal laboratory testing, and the sample  sent to a central 
laboratory.  Both IgM and IgG antibody testing will be employed.  If IgM and IgG are positive , the 
sample will be reflexively assayed for IgG avidity .  Validation testing has been performed on all three 
tests by [CONTACT_2237].   The central laboratory for the study will be the Department of 
Microbiology at the University Health Network and Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414395], Canada.  
The results will be forwarded by [CONTACT_628898] (BCC).  
There are two indications for re -screening patients:  
• A positive IgM antibody and negative IgG antibody.  The IgG antibody may be repeated in [ADDRESS_838115] be performed by 276 weeks.  
• A negative IgM antibody and negative IgG antibody.  Screening may be repeated in [ADDRESS_838116] ed by 276 weeks.  
All positive results will be retested by [CONTACT_628899].  
The clinical center staff will review the inclusion/exclusion criteria with the medical records of those 
patients who are identified as having a primary CMV infection  to determine whether they are potentially 
eligible.  I f the patient is interested  after the results are discussed with her , the research nurse will  
complete the eligibility determination, and inform the patient about the study in detail  and request 
informed consent for the trial .  An  ultrasound must be performed to evaluate the fetus for signs of 
established fetal CMV infection.  Signs of established  infection include: cerebral ventriculomegaly, 
microcephaly, cerebral or intra- abdominal calcifications, abnormalities of amniotic fluid volume, 
echo genic bowel or ascities .  The ultrasound must be performed after the patient has been screened but 
before randomization.  If the patient has not had a serum creatinine measured during pregnancy, blood 
will be collected and tested to ensure eligibility.   Patients must be randomized within 6 weeks of the 
qualifying screening sample.  
4.2 Randomization and Study Drugs  
If eligible and no more than 236 weeks (276 weeks for all those re -screened with seroconversion), the 
patient will be randomized.   The study nurse w ill complete the randomization order f orm which will be 
sent to the center’s pharmacy.  The center’s pharmacist will use a secure Internet website created by [CONTACT_628900] t he 
assigned study drug which is an IV infusion bag .   
The study’s active drug is Cytogam ®, a commercially available product,  which is an immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) containing a standardized amount of antibody to CMV.  This drug contains pooled adult human 
plasma selected for high titers of antibody for CMV, and is administered intravenously at a dose of 100 
mg/kg body weight.  The 100mg/kg dose of Cytogam® to be used in this trial was chosen based on an approximation to the study performed by [CONTACT_628901].
[ADDRESS_838117]® was used.  The maximum recommended dose for Cytogam® is 150 mg/kg, therefore the 
proposed dose for this study is within the range of that which has been tested for safety.  The matching 
placebo consis ts of Albu Rx® 5% diluted 1:9 with D5W .   AlbuRx ® 5% contains pooled adult human 
plasma.   Albumin has been used in a number of studies in pregnancy and has not be en associated with any 
adverse events.20,[ADDRESS_838118] EDC determination, 
the following information will be obtained at r andomization from a patient interview followed by a 
review of her chart:  
• Demographic information: age, race, insurance status  
• Medical history: pre- pregnancy weight, current weight, height, chronic disease history, 
transfusion history 
• Obstetrical history in cluding outcome of all prior pregnancies  and  history of vaginal bleeding  
• Social history: marital status, years of education, alcohol use, tobacco use and other maternal drug use  
• Use of day care by [CONTACT_7683], ages of children living at home  
• Current pregnanc y complications, including infections.  
• Maternal occupation  
A 20ml maternal blood sample and a [ADDRESS_838119] the patient continue the study medication.  
Patients will be seen monthly  (every 4 weeks)  until delivery.  At the monthly visits,  clinical center staff 
will assess whether the patient has any side effects, been administered ganciclovir or open -label immune 
globulin, and will review her medical chart for complications.  The study medication will be dispensed by 
[CONTACT_628902].  Additional blood (5ml) and urine 
(5ml) specimens will be collected before each infusion .  These samples will be stored to conduct future 
pharmaco genomic  studies  and for viral load testing.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_838120] with recommendations on the FDA -approved prescribing 
information (label) for Cytogam ®.  All infusions  will be administered in a healthcare setting.  The 
infusion will  be a dminister ed intravenously at 15 mg Ig per kg body weight per hour. If no adverse 
reactions occur after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 30 mg Ig/kg/hr; if no adverse reactions 
November  01, 2017  
12 occur after a subsequent 30 minutes, then increased to a maximum rate of  60 mg Ig/k g/hr (volume not to 
exceed 75 mL/hour).   
The rate of subsequent infusions may be accelerated , per the FDA -approved prescribing information 
(label) for Cytogam ®. The i nfusions should be administered at 15 mg Ig/kg/hr for 15 minutes. If no 
adverse reactions occur, the rate may  be increased  to 30 mg Ig/kg/hr for 15 minutes and then increase d to 
a maximum rate of 60 mg Ig/kg/hr (volume not to exceed 75 mL/hour).

In the event that hypotension or anaphylaxis occurs (expect very rarely), study infusions will be 
discontinued immediately.  Hypotension is defined as either a systolic blood pressure < 80 or a diastolic 
blood pressure < [ADDRESS_838122] op of 15 systolic or 10 diastolic.   
Anaphylaxis is defined as an acute syndrome occurring within minutes to hours of administration of the 
study drug and consisting of one or more of the following sets of symptoms:  
1. Angioedema (swelling) of the lips, tong ue, uvula and/or throat  
2. Generalized hives, flushing or pruritus  accompanied by [CONTACT_628903] 
(usually with tachycardia)  
3. Objective signs of dyspnea such as stridor and/or wheezing   
Flushing, generalized pruritis or hives alone would not meet criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis.  
However, if those dermatologic symptoms appear, the patient should be monitoring closely for 
development of additional signs of anaphylaxis.

procedure will be at the discretion of the patient’s p hysician.  Similarly, the only study ultrasound, if not 
done clinically,  will be done prior to enrollment; serial ultrasounds are at the discretion of the patient’s 
physician.  In the event of a fetal death ( miscarriage, termination,  or stillbirth)  the products of conception 
or placenta in the case of stillbirth  should be sent for pathologic evaluation for CMV infection.  
Participation in this study will not preclude the infants from receiving antiviral therapy post -natally . 
Pediatricians will be informe d at birth that the infant’s mother had a primary CMV infection during her 
pregnancy.  Whether or not the infant is quarantined in the nursery is up the individual institution.  Study 
forms detailing pregnancy and neonatal outcome information will be compl eted prior to mother -infant 
discharge.  H ead circumference will be measured on the neonate  within  72 hours after birth.  If a neonatal 
complete blood count including liver function tests was not performed, a blood specimen will be 
collected.  W ithin 2 days  of birth  and before any treatment , urine and saliva ( mouth swab)  will be 
collected on the  neonate.   Both will be subjected to culture and PCR. If the PCR is positive  for either 
urine or saliva  but both culture s are negative, then urine and saliva  should be re -collected within [ADDRESS_838124] month of life.  This a ssessment should include a nonsedated auditory brainstem response (ABR), middle ear immittance 
measures (tympanometry and acoustic reflex testing) and otoacoustic emissions.  Maternal and child

[CONTACT_15750]. 
The infants born to subjects in this research study will be followed for two  years.  In order to keep in 
touch with the infant, follow -up coordinators will use a variety of methods, including contact[CONTACT_628906].  Visits will be performed at 12 and 24 months.  At each visit, a 
saliva sample on the i nfant will be collected to assess viral load  and at the 24 month visit a saliva sample 
November  01, 2017

obtained:  
• Postnatal treatment for CMV infection  
• Medical history  
Developmental t esting using the Bayley III and h earing testing will be performed at the 24 month visit .  
The hearing testing includes  visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA), middle ear immittance measures 
(tympanometry and acoustic reflex testing) and otoacoustic emissions.  If hearing loss is suspected, bone 
conduction tests will also be performed to determine the type of hearing loss. For any child who cannot be 
reliably conditioned, a referral for further testing  by [CONTACT_628907]. 
The decision  for an audiological referral will be made by [CONTACT_8786].  
Hearing testing will be performed by [CONTACT_628908].   Hearing test results will be centrally 
reviewed by [CONTACT_628909] .

death, neonatal death, or life threatening maternal event by [CONTACT_6968]/phone/fax, if the event occurred in a MFMU Network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  For any maternal death, neonatal death, or life threatening mate rnal event 
occurring outside a MFMU Network hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , the adverse event must be reported to the NICHD and the 
BCC within twenty -four hours of being notified.   These and other adverse events deemed serious, 
unexpected and definitely, possibly or probably related, will be immediately (within twenty -four hours of 
notification) be forwarded by [CONTACT_92418] , NIH representative, and any other DSMC 
member who requests notification.   If a death is reported, a copy of the patient ’s medical record will be 
made.  Adverse events which don’t qualify under the above definition must be reported to the BCC within [ADDRESS_838126] follow -up of specific events.  All a dverse  events will be considered along with other interim 
safety data in the DSMC  deliberations.  
An IND safety report will be completed for any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and 
unexpected.  
The only indication for breaking the randomization code is when it is medically necessary to unmask the 
study drug assignment to be able to treat the patient.

18 5 Statistical Considerations  
5.1 Data Relevant to the Primary Outcome  
A large meta- analysis suggests that 32% of infants will be infected after a primary maternal infection.24  
This is a conservative estimate because the study  by [CONTACT_628919] a 40% congenital infection rate in 
the placebo group.4  The study by [CONTACT_628920] a 60% reduction in primary congenital CMV 
infection in the women treated with CMV hyperimmune globulin.      
5.2 Sample Size and Power  
The primary outcome for this study is fetal loss or neonatal congenital CMV infection.  The termination 
and fetal loss  rate in the placebo group is expected to be 10% and of the remaining 90%, the neonatal  
congenital  infection rate  will be 32% .  Therefore,  the overall primary outcome rate in the placebo group is 
expected to be 38%.  Assuming a lower termination and fetal loss rate of 7% in the treated group and a 
30% reduction in the infection rate, a  total sample size of [ADDRESS_838127] the difference of 38% to 26.6% with power of at least 90 percent and type -I error (2 -sided) of 5%.  
Table 3. Sample Sizes per Group for Different Primary Outcome Rates, Power and Effect Sizes  
 
  Primary Outcome Rate in Placebo  Group  
% Reduction  in   
     Infection Rate  % Power  36% 38% 40%

85 450 420 390

30 80 310 290 270 
85 350 320 300 
90 400 370 350 
 
The major secondary outcome is an ordinal variable that categorizes the severity of CMV infection into 
four categories, 1) fetal loss or death of neonate, infant or child, 2) congenital CMV infection with s evere 
disability defined as s ensorineural hearing loss , developmental delay (Cogn itive score < 70 or Motor 
score < 70 on the Bayley III), chorioretinitis  or seizure disorder , 3) congenital CMV infection without 
severe disability  or 4) infant not infected with CMV.   The rates of the four categories will be 11.7%, 
5.5%, 21.6% and 61.2% assuming the 10% termination/fetal loss rate  and 32% congenital infection rate  
stated  earlier and further assuming that  of the 32% of infected inf ants, 6% will die and 19% will have a 
severe disability based on data from Fowler, et al .25  Assuming a 5% los t to follow -up rate  and test for 
trend using a linear rank score , a sample size of [ADDRESS_838128] a 30% 
reduction in each of the three adverse categories (11.7% to 7.8%, 5.5% to 3.7%, and 21.6% to 14.4%) 
with a power greater than 90 percent and type -I error (2 -sided) of 5%.   
5.[ADDRESS_838129] 10,000 women 
are screened.  The feasibility of this trial is largely based on the assumptions of a 1% screen positive and 
November  01, 2017  
19 50% consent rate which means 200 women wi ll need to be screened for every woman randomized.   An 
upper limit of 300 women screened for every randomization has been established.  If the number is below 
this limit, feasibility will be assured and the trial will continue as planned.  If the upper li mit is exceeded, 
the Data  and Safety Monitoring Committee will be consulted for consideration of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_577365] . 
5.4 Interim Analysis  
Interim statistical analyses of clinical trials are a requirement of all National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
sponsored clinical trials.  26  The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) meets in person at least 
once per year.  For this trial, the DSMC will conduct a six-monthly regular review of trial performance 
and safety issues.  The first  full review of saf ety and pe rformance issues  will occur when [ADDRESS_838130] at the time of the annual meeting and at the six month point 
in between the annual meetings.  This timing may be modified by [CONTACT_6802].  
Before each of the six monthly meeting s, a formal detailed report will be written by [CONTACT_92421] (BCC) which presents a ll baseline variables, protocol adherence, side effects, all 
adverse events reported , as well as center performance in terms of recruitment, data quality, loss to 
follow -up and protocol violations.   
Once sufficient patients have been accrued into the trial, the report will also include a  formal interim 
analysis evaluating the primary outcome  by [CONTACT_1570].  For this evaluation, a cohort of patients is 
chosen consisting of all patients randomized before a certain date so that the analysis cohort does not 
depend on gestational age at delivery.  B ecause women may be randomized early in gestation, this cohort 
will consist of women randomized at least [ADDRESS_838131] 18 months after study start, it is expected that 150 women 
(19% of the final sample size)  will be in th e analysis cohort .  The actual number of women in the cohort 
will depend on the rate of recruitment .  This first formal interim analysis w ill occur at between 15% and 
30% of the final sample size (i.e. 120 to 240 women).   Subsequent interim analyses of the primary outcome will occur  annually or more frequently at the discretion of the DSMC.   
The main statistical issue relevant to interim analysis is the problem of performing multiple tests of 
significance on accumulating data.  A number of procedures have be en developed to handle this 
situation.
27,[ADDRESS_838132] to the timing of 
the interim analyses.  Asymmetric stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_92406]- deMets procedure.  The 
upper boundary which describes the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_628886] 1- sided type I error of .025 
and the Lan -deMets generalization of the O’Brien -Fleming boundary.   
Sometimes, a surprising development may lead to extra looks or even continuous monitoring of the data, 
such as on a monthly basis.  The Lan- DeMets procedure is flexible, in that one can switch from 
occasional to continuous monitoring of the data, with negligible effect on the type I error level.32  In some 
instances the Lan -DeMets boundary for statistical significance may be crossed, but due to other 
considerations the DSMC decides that the trial should continue.  In this case, the type I error previously 
spent under by [CONTACT_941] α  spending function can be retrieved to be distributed over future looks without 
inflating the total type I error probability.33  The lower boundary will be based on a less stringent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10035]: 1 -sided type 1 error of .05 and the Lan- deMets generalization of the Pocock type boundary.   
If recruitment proceeds as planned and annual analyses are conducted, it is expected  that three interim 
analyses will be conducted at 19%, 44%, and 69% of the final sample size of 800.  This would require 
critical values of 4.0, 3.19, and 2.47 to cross the boundary for benefit, corresponding to p- values of 
November  01, 2017  
20 .[ZIP_CODE], .0007, and .007, respectively.  To cross the boundary for harm would require critical values of      
-2.19, -2.09 and - 2.06, c orresponding to p- values of .014, .018, and .039. However, this guideline will  not 
preclude the DSMC  recommending termination earlier for  evidence of harm  in the primary outcome .  
In addition, the BCC will continuously monitor potential cases of treatment emergent serious adverse 
events in  the active arm during the trial  (defined as maternal death, thromboembolic event or anaphlyaxis 
in Maternal Secondary Outcomes  Section 4.7.2) .   If the  number of such events  that occur within 72 hours 
of infusion meets the number in the table below, recruitment for the study will immediately halt until the 
DSMC has met and reviewed all of the data to determine whether the trial should continue.

The numbers were calculated assuming a 0.5% rate of one of these events occurring in a  pregnancy  in the 
general population, and finding the smallest number of events such that the probability that the  observed 
event rate exceeds 0.5% is less than [ADDRESS_838133].34  If this conditional power is low (under 10 
percent) the DSMC may consider ter mination for futility if the accrual rate is slow with confidence that 
the Type II error is not greatly inflated.  
It is recognized that any decision to terminate the study would not be reached solely on statistical grounds 
but on a number of complex clini cal and statistical considerations.  [ADDRESS_838134] prevails throughout particular 
subgroups of patients.  Indeed, NIH guidelines require investigators to evaluate consistency between the genders and across racial subgroups (see Section 5.5.1).  It should be noted, however, that subgroup 
analyses have been greatly abused,
36 particularly when there is no overall treatment difference.  There is a 
strong temptation to search for a specific subpopulation in which the therapy  is nevertheless effective.  
Yusuf et al37 concluded “ the overall ‘average’ result of a randomized clinical trial is usually a more 
reliable estimate of the treatment effect in the various subgroups examined than are the observed effects 
in individual subgroups .”  Thus subgroup analyses will be interpreted with care.   
It is generally acknowledged that subgroup analysis that is pre- specified in the protocol has more validity 
than ad- hoc comparisons.  The following factors will be considered for subgroup ana lysis, if there is a 
significant interaction between the factor of interest and the treatment effect.  
• Race/ethnicity (see below)  
• Gestational age at randomization  (<16 weeks and ≥ 16 weeks)  
• Viral load  at randomization  (detectable  and not detectable ) 
• Avidity ( < 30%  and ≥ 30% ) 
• Maternal age (< 25 years  and ≥ 25 years ) 
• BMI at randomization ( < 30 and ≥ 30) 
Loss to follow -up will be defined as the inability to ascertain whether the infant was born alive and if 
born alive whether the neonate was infected wit h CMV .  Those defined as lost to follow -up will not be 
included in the primary analysis.  It is expected that the loss to follow -up rate will be very low.  For trials 
conducted by [CONTACT_628921], the loss to follow -up rate has typi[INVESTIGATOR_628887] [ADDRESS_838135] to the investigators and of 
relevance to the objectives of the stu dy. 
5.5.1 Racial/Ethnic Subgroup Analysis  
The racial/ ethnic  composition of patients of women recruited into the MFMU Network trials varies.  
Assuming for this trial that the composition is 25% African -American and 25% Hispanic , there is a 
minimum of 80%  power to detect a 50% reduction in the primary outcome in each of the two subgroups.

6.2 Web Data Entry  System  
For this protocol, web data entry screens corresponding to the study forms listed above will be developed 
and maintained by [CONTACT_92424].  Clinical center staff will enter data into the MySQL database 
located at the BCC through a web data managemen t system (MIDAS).  The data are edited on -line for 
missing, out of range and inconsistent values.  A Users’ Manual documenting this system is provided to the centers by [CONTACT_92425].   
November  01, 2017  
23 6.3 Centralized Data Management System  
Daily data conversions from the MySQL database create up -to-date SAS datasets.  Data are reviewed 
weekly using edit routines similar to those implemented on -line during data entry, as well as additional 
checks for data consistency within or across forms.  A database of resulting potential data pro blems is 
generated in MIDAS for initial review by [CONTACT_628922], who then evaluate the comments keyed in 
association with edits on missing or unusual values. Valid edits will be flagged in MIDAS for resolution 
at the clinical centers.   
At regular intervals, s pecialized data reviews comparing data availability and consistency across forms 
are run by [CONTACT_92427] a specific subset of data.  These reports are also submitted to the centers for correction or clarification.  
An audit tra il, consisting of all prior versions of each data form as entered in the computer for each 
patient, is maintained so that the succession of corrections can be monitored.  
6.4 Performance Monitoring 
The BCC will present regular reports to the CMV Subcommittee, t he Steering Committee, and the Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee.  These include:  
• Monthly R ecruitment R eports -  reports of the number of women screened and enrolled by [CONTACT_628923].  Bi- weekly reports are provided electronically if needed.  
• Quarterly Steering Committee R eports -  report s detailing recruitment, baseline patient 
characteristics, data quality, incidence of missing data and adherence to  study protocol by [CONTACT_92429], are provided quarterly to the CMV Subcommittee and all other members of the Steering Committee.  
• Data and Safety Monitoring Committee Reports -  for every meeting of the DSMC, a report is 
prepared which includes patient re cruitment, baseline patient characteristics, center performance 
information with respect to data quality, timeliness of data submission and protocol adherence (in 
addition to safety and efficacy data).  The reports also include adverse events, loss to foll ow-up 
and all outcome variables as described previously in this protocol.

responsible for the preparation and conduct of the study, and reporting the progress of the study to the 
Steering Committee.  
7.2.3 Publications Committee  
The Publications Committee is a  standing committee of the Steering Committee.  The functions of this 
committee are to develop publication policies and to review all manuscripts and abstracts prior to 
submission.  The goals of this committee are fair and appropriate authorship credit and high quality 
publications.  
7.2.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), a group of individuals not affiliated with any of the participating institutions, was established by [CONTACT_92434].  Before the trial can begin, t he protocol must be 
approved by [CONTACT_942].  During the conduct of the study, the committee is charged with monitoring the emerging results for efficacy and safety, in addition to center performance and protocol adherence.  
Recommendations by [CONTACT_628924], early termination for efficacy, or 
for unexpected safety problems.  R ecommendations are made to the NICHD and disseminated to the

Once the study start date is set, o ne month start -up time is allotted to complete final training (and 
certification ), in addition to distribution of study drugs.  It is assumed that all other preparation for the 
trial will have been completed, including  obtaining the  IND and I RB approval, preparation of the 
randomization sequence, preparation of the study drugs, implementation of  the d ata entry and 
management system . 
Each participating center must be certified to start the trial before recruitment at that center can begin.  
The certification requirements are designed to ensure that personnel involved in the trial are committed to 
the stu dy and proficient in study procedures, and that the center has satisfied regulatory requirements.  
Each center is required to obtain IRB approval for the study before they are certified to begin the trial.   Training/Certification

27 8.2 Recruitment  and Data Collection Period  
Assuming  a 1% primary maternal infection rate before 23 weeks, and a conservative 50% consent rate, 
approximately 160,00 0 women would need to be screened to enroll 800 subjects. Approximately  3,500 
women  per month under went  serological screening  at the peak recruitment for the MFMU TSH trial . At 
this rate, screening could be accomplished in 4 years.        
8.3 Final Analysis  
After a two -month period for completion of data entry for the trial  and close- out of the delivery and 
primary outcome , the data  set will be locked and available for the primary outcome analysis.  
Approximately 6 months will be required to submit the study’s primary report for publication.  No other 
outcome reports will be presented or published until completion of the infant follo w-up.  After completion 
of the 2 year infant follow -up, a two- month period will be dedicated to complete data entry and close -out 
of this follow -up.  Approximately 6 months will be required to complete the final report to the Steering 
Committee and to subm it the study’s report on follow -up for publication.

Introduction  
You are invited to be screened to see if you are el igible to take part in a research study.  This consent 
form provides the information about the risks and benefits of the screening portion of this research study.  
You can  choose whether or not you will take part in the study .  If you agree to take part , you will need  to 
sign this consent form.  This process is known as informed consent.  
Research Purpose  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that is spread like a cold or flu .  A very small number of 
pregnant women, approximately 1%, will get infected w ith CMV for the first time while they are 
pregnant.  If a woman gets infected for the first time during pregnancy, there is a 40% chance that the 
fetus will also get infected .  Fetuses that get infected with CMV are more likely to be born earlier than 
expe cted (i.e., preterm) , have low birth weight or small heads.  A  small number of the  infected  babies will 
develop problems  such as hearing loss, difficulty learning or rarely, the baby [CONTACT_628926].      
The way we will  know whether  you have been infected  during pregnancy is by  [CONTACT_628927].  The 
purpose of this study is to see if giving CMV antibodies  (i.e. substances that target and help the immune 
system destroy the CMV) to pregnant women who have been infected with CMV  for the first time during 
pregnancy will result in fewer fetuses  being infected with CMV .  Since the number of pregnant women 
infected for the first time  is expected to be small, w e anticipate that approximately 160,[ADDRESS_838141] to confirm the initial findings.  
If you are found to be eligible, y ou may  be approached by a research nurse to consent to the research 
study which is a randomized, placebo controlled study of treatment with CMV antibodies  during 
pregnancy.     
Possible Risks  
You may experience the discomforts associated with drawing blood, which may include bruising, discomfort or pain at the site, infection, or fainting.

Introduction  
The laboratory test of your blood, which was done to screen you for this research study, suggests that you 
have  been infected with  cytomegalovirus (CMV)  for the first time  (i.e. a primary infection) .  In this study, 
you may be given CMV antibodies that might  help your immune system destroy the CMV infection so 
you cannot pass it to your baby.  Antibodies are substances that are purified from human blood.  
Antibodies target and help the immune system to destroy harmful organisms.  
Before you decide to be a part of this study, you need to understand the risks and benefits.  This consent 
form provides information about the research study.  A staff member of the research study w ill be 
available to answer your questions.  You can  choose whether or not you will take part in the study.  If you 
agree to take part, you need  to sign this consent form.  This process is known as informed consent.  
Research Purpose  
CMV is a common virus t hat usually has  few symptoms .  When first infected, some people may feel  tired , 
weak , have a  fever , or swollen glands.  Most people in the [LOCATION_002] a re infected  during childhood or 
as adults if they work around children.  When women get infected with CMV for the first time while 
pregnant, the virus may infect their baby.  About a third of infected babies  may develop permanent 
disabilities including hearing loss and learning difficulties .  A small number  will die from the infection.   
It is not usual  practice to screen pregnant women for CMV infection.  Also , there is no agreement about 
how to evaluate and manage pregnant women infected with CMV for first time  like you.  At this point, 
there is not enough evidence that any treatment helps  the baby.   
This research study was set up to find out  whether  treating pregnant women who have a primary CMV 
infection with CMV antibodies will lower  the number of babies  infected with CMV.  The research study 
is funded by [CONTACT_628930] 
(NICHD).  M edical centers across the country are part of  this research study  and, i n all, [ADDRESS_838146] an ultrasound to see if the baby  [CONTACT_628931].  We may take a small amount (half teaspoon)  of blood to measure how your kidneys 
are doing.  If you are still eligible, you will be random ly put into one of two treatment groups like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a coin.  One group will receive the active research medication (CMV antibodies) and the other group will 
receive the placebo , a medic ation  that looks the same, which is water with sugar and protein.  Both 
medications are given through a n intravenous  (IV) tube .   
You, your doctor, and the research study nurse will not know which treatment group you are in or if you 
are getting the CMV antibodies or placebo.  This is to make sure everyone is treated the same.  In case of 
November  01, 2017  
VersionDate: 11/01/[ADDRESS_838147] a small amount ( 1½ tablespoons ) of blood and a small amount 
(1½ tablespoon) of urine that gets stored.  If you agree, a small amount (½ teaspoon) of your blood will be 
used to make DNA, which is material containing your genetic information.  The first IV may take up to [ADDRESS_838148] infusion.   
< You may be asked to stay  at the location of your study visit for [ADDRESS_838149] from the IV .  TH E CHOICE OF ONE OR BOTH 
OPTIONS IS  CENTER SPECIFIC  >.   A nurse will also call y ou 16- [ADDRESS_838150] infusion , IVs will be given every 4 weeks until you deliver . They may take less time ( 3-5 
hours) and will be given in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic, or other healthcare setting.  We will collect blood a nd 
urine ( one teaspoon each)  before each monthly IV  and store the  samples in order to test the amount of the 
virus in your body as well as the response to the medication.  We will also store some blood and urine in case we need to verify if you had any viruses before being given the study medication.  
At each of these monthly visits, the study medication will be given by [CONTACT_628932].  A  nurse 
will only call you 16- [ADDRESS_838151] information on your pregnancy, labor, and the status of the baby .  
Your baby’s head will be measured to record your child’s growth.  We may collect a small amount of 
blood (less than ¼ teaspoon) from your baby [CONTACT_628933]’s blood cells and liver.  In the first few 
days after your baby [CONTACT_50835], we will collect urine and saliva samples  from your baby  [CONTACT_628934] a lab to  test if he or she  is infected with CMV.  We will tell you of the results of this test.  We 
will also schedule a hearing test to take place before you leave if possible .  If not, it will be scheduled 
within the first month to have specific hearing tests done on your baby .  These hearing tests are very 
important to see if your baby [CONTACT_628935][INVESTIGATOR_307].  We will tell you if your child has trouble hearing.   
A nurse will keep in touch with you so that your child can have visits done at one and two years of age.  
At each visit, trained staff will collect information on medica tion he or she  may be taking or medical 
events that occurred since the last visit.  We will also collect another  saliva sample from your child so that 
we can determine the amount of CMV virus (if any) is in your child’s saliva.  All of the tests that will be 
done are commonly used with young children.  At the two year visit, we will collect a small amount of 
your baby’s saliva to obtain DNA and trained staff will give your child hearing and developmental 
testing.   If your child has hearing loss, you will be told after the test is completed.  You will learn t he 
results of the development testing after the 24 months visit.    
Possible Risks  
You may experience the discomforts associated with drawing blood or receiving the IV medication .  This 
can include bruising, discomfort or pain at the site, infection, or fainting. 
Both the active and placebo medication come from large pools of adult human blood.  The effects on the 
fetus are unknown.  Other antibodies like these are routinely used during preg nancy for a number of 
November  01, 2017  
VersionDate: 11/01/2017  
35 reasons including exposure to other viruses (hepatitis B, chicken pox). Because Cytogam® and placebo 
are made from human blood it may carry a risk of transmitting infections.  This is unlikely to happen 
because the CMV antibodies have been made from blood that has been carefully selected and tested and 
the creating of the drug involves removing viruses that cause infection.  
Minor side effects associated with the infusion of CMV antibodies or protein in the placebo include flushing, chi lls, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, joint pain and wheezing.  These 
happen to about 6 out of every 100 infusions and are usually fixed by [CONTACT_628936].  Other serious side effects including asept ic meningitis syndrome (nerve swelling), 
lung injury, kidney failure, destruction of red blood cells, and blood clotting events, have been reported 
but the chance of these occurring is very small.  In one study that was conducted in pregnant women, no 
side effects were reported with use of CMV antibodies.  Another recent study suggests that there is a 
possible increase in preterm birth with treatment using CMV antibodies.   
Other  studies have been conducted using this placebo in pregnant women and no seriou s side effects were 
reported with use of the placebo. It is possible  to have a severe allergic reaction or drop in blood pressure 
with the study infusion of CMV antibodies or placebo .  If this happens, the infusion will be stopped 
immediately.   
Although unlikely, it is possible that participation in this study could involve risks to you or your baby 
[CONTACT_628937]. 
Benefits  
If you decide to take part in this research study, you and your baby [CONTACT_628938].  If the study shows that treatment with CMV antibodies prevents babies from being infected 
in women newly infected with CMV, this treatment  may be made available to other pregnant women.  
Therefore, your participation can possibly help mothers and their babies in the future.  
Consent for Use/Disposal of Blood , Urine and Saliva   
By [CONTACT_50841], you ag ree to the use of your blood and urine , and your baby’s urine and 
saliva for testing the amount of virus in your blood or your baby’s blood and for checking whether you 
had another virus before getting the first IV .   
If you agree  to have some of your blood sample  processed to get  DNA, we wi ll test your DNA to see 
whether your genes change how the study medication works .  
If any  samples remain after the study  tests, and if you agree, they may  be used for future research , 
including DNA research, on the health of mothers and children.  The samples, without information 
identifying you or your baby, will be sent to a National Institute s of Health sample storage facility, where 
they will be stored indefinitely .  They will be accessed only by [CONTACT_628939] s of Health.  An Institutional Review Board must also approve any future research, including 
DNA research , using you r and your baby’s samples.   
However if the researchers decide that there is no more use for your samples, you agree that they  may  be 
thrown away. 
Alternative Procedures  
The alternative to this study is not to participate  and contin ue receiving  standard monitoring and care 
during pregnancy, labor and delivery .  
Costs  
There will be no cost to you to take part in the research study.  All research study related medications and 
procedures will be provided at no cost to you or your insura nce company.  The costs of your standard 
medical care will be billed to you or your insurance company in the usual manner.

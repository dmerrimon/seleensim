1.1. Background
Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CL E) is a chronic autoimmune disorder, most commonly  
diagnosed in women 20 -50 years of age .Approximately  1/3 of women who are diagnosed with 
CLE also develop sy stemic lupus ery thema tosus (SL E) {Wie czorek 2014 }. In a study  of over 
1,000 patients with CL E in Sweden, it was found that 24% of the patients c arried a diagnosis of 
SLE, while another 18% gained a diagnosis of SLE over a 2 year period {Gronhagen 2011}. 
Thus, treatment and monitoring of CLE includes ongoing assessment for and/or treatment of 
SLE, which is also highly  female -predominant.
Cutaneous lupus ishistologically  characterized by [CONTACT_386037], in which ly mphocy tes 
infiltrate the basal epi[INVESTIGATOR_386011], resulting in hy dropic 
degeneration with colloid bodies. I nflammation in CL Eis mediated in part by  [CONTACT_24975] I interferons 
as well as T oll-like receptor ( TLR)
-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Subty pes of CLE 
include : chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE), subacute cutaneous lupus
erythematosus (SCL E), and acute cutaneous lupus ery thematosu s (ACLE). The most common 
subty pe of CLE is CCLE, and in particular discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) which accounts 
forapproximately  half of all CL E {Jarrett 2016}.  A diagnosis of ACL E in isolation will not 
qualify  a subject for entry  into thisstudy . 
Overall, therapeutic options for CL E are limited {Winkelmann 2013 }. There are fewapproved 
disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for CLE, and very  limited clinical trial data 
in CL E for the biologic and sy nthetic DMARDs that have been approved for other indications. 
Avoidance of sunlight and topi[INVESTIGATOR_386012], due to the 
photosensitive nature of the disease. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_386013] (eg, clobetosol), or 
injectable corticosteroids are commonl y used, as well as topi[INVESTIGATOR_153205] 
(eg,tacrolimus). A ntimalarials (eg, chloro quine or hy droxychloroquine) are among the most 
common oral medications used . Other drugs used for CL E include: methotrexate (MTX) , 
azathioprine, biologic disease -modify ing anti rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs; such as rituximab or 
belimumab), cy clophosphamide, cy closporine, dapsone, gold salts, intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIG), mycophenolate, retinoids, and thalidomide, but efficacy  with these agents is variable and 
toxicities can be dose limiting .
Filgotinib (GS -6034, formerly  GLPG0634) is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of janus kinase
(JAK) 1being developed by  [CONTACT_10869], Inc. ([COMPANY_009]) and Galapagos (GLP)NV. 
Janus kinase 1 is believed to play  an integral part in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune 
diseases, due its role in inflammatory  cytokine signaling.  
GS-9876 is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of spleen ty rosine kinase (SYK) being developed 
by [CONTACT_386038] t of inflammatory  diseases. Spleen ty rosine kinase is acytoplasmic 
tyrosine kinase
(TYK) primarily  expressed in cells o f the hematopoietic lineage, where it 
functions as a key  signaling molecule mediating immunoreceptor signaling. Given its central role 
in immune cell signaling, inhibition of SYK is expected to affect multiple steps in the 
pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases resulting in pleiotropic anti -inflammatory  effects.

1.2.2. Nonclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology
Filgotinib is a highl y selective, adenosine triphosphate ( ATP )-competitive inhibitor of JAK1. I n 
cellular assay s, it inhibits JAK/ signal transduction and activator of transcription ( STAT )-driven 
processes with half maximal inhibitory  concentration (I C50) values from 179 nM upwards ;in 
human whole blood assays, filgotinib exhibits approximately  30-fold selectivity  over JAK2. 
Filgotinib demonstrated significant efficacy  in the rat collagen -induced arthritis (CIA)model as 
well as in the mouse dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) -induced colitis model. Filgotinib’s 
metabolite, GS -829845, exhibits a similar JAK1 selectivity  profile, but is approximately  
10to20-fold less potent than filgotinib.
In rats, filgotinib and GS -829845 had no effects on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_386014] ( human ether -

Inrepeat -dose studies, toxicity was assessed in r ats and monkey s administered GS -9876 orally  
for up to 39 weeks. Dose -dependent effects on l ymphocytes in both rats a nd monkey s were 
consistent with the expected pharmacology  of SYK inhibition. Effects observed in rats and

thrombosis in monkey s at ≥ 20 mg/kg/day. At higher doses in rats ( ≥ 30 mg/kg/day ), mortality  
associated with bacterial infections was seen, likely resulting from the immunomodulatory  
activity  of GS -9876. Additional findings included ly mphoid depletion in the thy mus, changes in 
the pancreas, with secondary  effects r elated to the immunomodulatory activity  of GS -9876, and
opportunistic bacterial infection, observed in several tissues. The no- observed -adverse- effect

In the 28 -day monkey  study , there were no adverse effects at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day , with
hemorrhagi c/thrombotic effects noted at 20 mg/kg/day . In the 39 -week monkey  study , there was 
no evidence of effects on hemostasis, and the NOAEL was 15 mg/kg/day , associated with an 
AUC 0-24hrof 8040 ng•h/mL . One animal administered 15 mg/kg/day  was sacrificed for humane 
reasons with persistent fecal changes, weight loss, deteriorating clinical condition, and large 
bowel inflammation. The moribund condition of this animal was not considered directl y related 
to GS

Drug -drug interactions in vivo are unlikel y through inhibition of human CYP enzy mes,

1.4.
Rationale for This Study
Although CLE affects approximately  70 per 100,000 persons in the [LOCATION_002] (US) , 
therapeutic options for CLE are limited {Winkelmann 2013 }. There are fewapproved DMARDs 
for CL E(eg, h ydroxychloroquine and MTX) , and very  limited clinical trial data in CL E for the 
various newer biologi c and sy nthetic DMARDs that have been approved for other indications. 
Some individuals with CLE have an inadequate response or intolerance to available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The most common oral therap y for CLE, h ydrox ychloroquine, has a rare, but serious cumulative 
risk of irreversible retinopathy  which potenti ally limits its long -term use. 
There is an unmet need 
for orall y administered therapi[INVESTIGATOR_386016] y improve the disease.
Filgotinib is an orall y administered, small molecule inhibitor of JAK1, an intracellular TYK
dysregulated in subjects with inflammatory  disorders. Filgotinib has demonstrated clinical 
activity  and a favorable safet y and tolerability profile in Phase 2 studies in subjects with 
moderatel y to severel y active RA. Janus kinase 1 activation is required for ty pe I interferon 
(IFN) signaling, which is thought to be central to both sy stemic and cutaneous lupus. Further, in 
vivo studies using a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ( ruxolitinib) attenuated the development of skin 
lesions in the MRL /lpr mouse model of lupus {Chan 2015}.
Given its central role in immune cell signaling, inhibition of SYK is expected to have pleiotropic 
anti-inflammatory  effects and affect mu ltiple steps in CL E pathogenesis. B cells have been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of CL
E as demonstra ted b y an increased number of B cells in the 
peripheral blood and lesions of individuals with DLE {Wouters 2004}. B cell depletion 
demonstrates an effect in individuals with certain ty pes of CLE {Vital 2015 }. As a critical 
mediator of BCR signaling, SYK inhibition suppresses BCR -stimulated proliferation, 
co-stimulatory  molecule expression, and autoantibody  production {Braselmann 2006 , Coffey  
2012}. Phosphory lated SYK and SYK -associated genes are highly  expressed in several cell t ypes 
in CL E skin including keratinocy tes and infiltrating immune cells. Further, inhibiting SYK in 
GS-9876

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 4
CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 15 October 2018vitro decreases keratinocyte expression of pro -inflammatory  cytokin es {Braegelmann 2016 }. 
Spleen ty rosine kinase inhibition in two lupus- prone mou se models (MRL /lpr and BAK/BAX) 
suppresse sskin disease {Deng 2010 }.
The data suggest that inhibition of SYK 
orof JAK1 may  decrease several pro cesses implicated 
in CL Epathoph ysiology including B -cell and T -cell activation. 
1.4.1. Rational efor Endpoint and Tim ing
Change in theCutaneous L upus Ery thematosus Disease Area and Severit y Index (CLASI )
activity  score will be the primary  measure of efficacy  compared to placebo. The CLASI  is a 
standardized measure of cutaneous -lupus disease activity  and damage widely  used in clinical 
studies {Klein 2010}. Secondary  measures will include phy sician and subject reported outcomes. 
Quality  of life will be measured using validated questionnaires including the Dermatology  
Quality  of Life Instrument (DLQI ) {Holm 2016} and the 36 Item Short Form Health Survey  
(SF-
36). Satisfaction with the study  drugs will be measured using the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (
TSQM ).
Given the chronic nature of CL E, the primary  endpoint (change in the CL ASI activity  score) will 
be assessed at Week 12 to provide adequate time for clinical response in skin scores. The 
selection of this time point is based on prior studies of CLE and other dermatological 
inflammatory  conditions such as plaque psoriasis {Schmitt 2014 }and on the speed of action of 
filgotinib (approximately 80
-90% of total clinical benefit achieved b y week 12), as demonstrated 
in Phase 2b studies of subjects with active RA (protocols GL PG0634- CL-203 and 
GLPG0634- CL-204). Review of the published information on prior randomized studies in CL E 
demonstrates a range of drug administration duration between 8 weeks for hy droxychloroquine 
{Ruzicka 1992} and 6 months for MTX {Carneiro 1999}, supporting the idea that a 12 week 
primary  
endpoint is both clinically  and ethicall y appropriate and allows an acceptable time to 
assess initi al response to therap y.
1.4.2. Rationale for Dose
Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive once daily oral filgotinib (200 mg), GS-9876 
(30mg), or matched placebo tablets. The regimens of filgotinib and GS- 9876 are based on safet y 
data from 
clinical studi es and supported b y non-clinical safet y data.Clinical efficacy  data further 
support the filgotinib dose.
Results from Phase 2a studies (GL PG-CL-201 and GL PG-CL-202) and Phase 2b studies 
(GLPG-CL-203 and GL PG-CL-204) showed that 200 mg once dail y filgotinib was well tolerated 
and demonstrated clinical efficacy  (ACR20/50/70 and DAS28[CRP]) in subjects with RA. 
Exposure -response anal ysis of data from Phase 2 studies indicated a dose -dependent incr ease in 
efficacy , with a plateau at the 200 mg total daily  dose on the dose -response curve. These results 
are consistent with the relationship observed between filgotinib exposures and pSTAT1 
activation (ex -
vivo) following single and multiple filgotinib doses, where maximal inhibition of 
pSTAT1 (~78%) was achieved at or above the 200 mg total dail y dose {Namour 2015}. Safet y 
data collected across Phase 2 clinical studies showed no dose
-dependent trends in the inci dence 
GS-9876
Protocol GS -US-436-4092 FINAL
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 4
CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 15 October 2018of AEs or SAEs. Based on the overall risk-benefit observed in Phase 2b studies, as well as the 
clinical overlap of RA and CL E, 200 mg once daily  filgotinib is expected to be a safe dose to 
evaluate efficacy in subjects with CL E.
A 30 mg once dail y dose of GS -9876 will be investigated in this study . In the multiple ascending 
dose study  (GS-US-
379-1900), GS -9876 doses ofup to 50 mg once daily for 7 day s were well 
tolerated in health y volunteers. A trial of GS-9876 30 mg once dail yis also under investi gation 
insubjects with RA(GS-US-
379-1582). Based on the similarity  in risk -benefit profiles between 
RA and CL E, a [ADDRESS_483654] 
the potential to be efficacious in CL E.
The totality  of avai lable data support theuse of filgotinib 200mg once daily and GS-9876 30 mg 
once dail yfor Phase 
2evaluation.
1.5. Risk/Benefit Assessment for the Study
Based on the clinical data to date, as well as the data from nonclinical efficacy  and mechanistic 
studies, there is a positive benefit -risk ratio for the d evelopment of filgotinib and GS -[ADDRESS_483655] on cardiovascular 
parameters (including vital signs and ECGs), respi[INVESTIGATOR_386017]. In the Phase 2b studies in RA, the most common AEs were in the 
Infections and Infestations SOC, and infections were reported more commonly  in the filgotinib 
groups. Pneumonia is an identified risk for filgotinib 
and serious infection is considered an 
important potential risk .Reference is made to the IB for further information .
As fil gotinib is an immunomodulat oryagent, malignancy  is closel y monitored in clinical studies. 
Although a n association of NHL and other malignancies with filgotinib has not been established, 
“NHL and other malignancies” is considered to be an important potential risk. Reference is made 
to the IB for further information.
Nonclinical studies in rats and dogs identified l ymphoid tissues and testes as target organs for
filgotinib in long -term repeat -dose toxicity  studies. Although decreased l ymphocyte number s
observed in nonclinical studies have not been seen in clinical studies, hematological assessments 
will be performed throughout the present study  to ensure this potential risk is appropriatel y 
monitored. I n both rats and dogs, microscopic findings in the testes included germ cell depletion 
and degeneration with reduced sperm content and increased cell debris in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_290032],and 
reduc edfertility  in male rats. When using the AUC atthe NOELs for dogs in the [ADDRESS_483656] therapeutic value in the treatment of multiple autoimmune 
diseases such as RA, SLE, autoimmune cy topenias, as well asallergic and autoinflammatory  
diseases. Clinical experience with GS -9876 is limited. 
In repeat dose toxicity  studies of GS -9876 (in rats for up to 26 weeks and in cy nomolgus 
monkey s for up to 39 weeks), the primary  observed effects were reversible, dose -dependent 
decreases in circulating lymphocy tes, and decreased ly mphocy tes in various tissues 
(spleen, lymph nodes, thy mus, and/or bone marrow), consistent with the expected pharmacology  
of SYK inhibition {Barr 2012}. Additionally , effects on ery throcy te turnover were seen in rats, 
and effects on hemostasis (hemorrhage and thrombosis) were seen
 in monkey s. In clinical studies 
of GS -9876 in health y volunteers, no safety  signals were identified and no grade 3 or4 AEs were 
reported. There were no clinically  significant changes in vital signs, phy sical findings, laboratory  
parameters, or ECGs. Given the role of SYK in platelet activation and aggregation, bleeding time 
was evaluated in the study subjects; no clinically  relevant prolongation was noted. 
Filgotinib is contraindicated in pregnancy ; highl y effective contraception is to be used across all 
clinical studies to mitigate this risk. 
Preclinical and clinical data support the further clinical development of filgotinib and GS -
9876
due to their potential benefit as novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_386018], with an acceptable level of risk 
consistent with immunomodulation in this patient population. Contro lled trials will be utilized to 
minimize risk to subjects, while gaining understanding of drug efficacy . The development of 
GS-9876 and filgotinib are expected to provide valuable alternative sto existing treatments for 
CLE and related diseases.

3.5.1. Study Drug Interruption Considerations
The [COMPANY_009] m edical monitor should be consulted prior to study  drug interruption when medicall y 
feasible .
Study  drug interruption should be considered in the following circumstances; prior to resumption 
of study drug, the investigator should discuss the case with the [COMPANY_009] m edical monitor :
Intercurrent illness that would, in the judgment of the investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree
Subject is scheduled for elective or emergency  surgery  (excluding minor skin procedures 
under local or no anesthesia); timing of study  drug pausing should be determined in 
consulta tion with the [COMPANY_009] m edical monitor
If the subject has an y signs or symptoms suggestive of infection (regardless of severit y), 
study  drug dosing should be immediately  interrupted, and the medical monitor notified. Any  
subject who develops a new infection during the study  should undergo prompt and complete 
diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised individual, and the subject should 
be closel y monitored. Study drug should continue to be paused until the subject’s event has 
resolved, per judgmen t of the investigator.
Refer to Section 7.5for details on study  drug interruption due to AEs that are related to the 
study  drug(s)
NOTE: During the time of study drug interruption for any of the above, the subject may continue 
to have study visits and to take part in procedures and assessments, if deemed medically 
appropriate by [CONTACT_093].

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 4
CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 15 October [ZIP_CODE].5.2. Study Drug Discontinuation Criteria
The [COMPANY_009] medical monitor should be consulted prior to study  drug discontinuation whenever
feasible. 
Study drug should be permanently  discontinued in the following instances:
Any opportunistic infection
Any serious infection that requires antimicrobial therap y or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or an y infection 
that meets SAE reporting criteria
Complicated herpes zoster i
nfection (with multi -dermatomal, disseminated, ophthalmic, or 
CNS involvement)
Evidence of active hepatitis C virus (HCV) during the study , as evidenced by  [CONTACT_386039]
Unacceptable toxicity , or toxicity  that, in the judgment of the investigator, com promises the 
subject’s ability  to continue study -specific procedures or is considered to not be in the 
subject’s best interest
Subject request to discontinue for an y reason
Subject noncompliance , per investigator judgment
Investigator discretion
 
Female subject becomes pregnant during the study ; refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Discontinuation of the study  at the request of [COMPANY_009], a regulatory  agency  or an institutional 
review board (IRB) / independent ethics c ommittee (IEC)
Subject use of prohibited concurrent therap y may trigger study  drug discontinuation; 
consultation should be made with the [COMPANY_009] medical 
monitor
Laboratory  Criteria: After becoming aware of any  of the following abnormal laboratory
values , study  drug should be paused, and an unscheduled visit (ie, sequential visit) should 
occur to retest within 3 to 7 days (except creatinine, which should be retested 7 to 14 days 
apart). Retest may  be obtained sooner if medicall y indicated per investigator judgment . If the 
laboratory  abnormality  is confirmed by  [CONTACT_386040], then study  drug should be permanently  
discontinued and further care of the subject ’s CL Eshould be as directed per the investigator .

Subjects who discontinue study  drug dosing at an y time may  continue with study  visits, 
procedures, and assessments, if deemed medically appropriate b y the investigator, but will not be 
eligible for entering the 24 -week extension period. Subjects who permanently  discontinue study  
drug for any reason will not be replaced.
Subjects withdrawing from the study  should complete the early  termination ( ET) and FU visits. 
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study  at any  time without providing reason(s) for 
withdrawal and without prejudice to fu rther treatment. The reason(s) for withdrawal will be 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_63381] -up. All contacts and 
contact [CONTACT_155806]’ s file.
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study  at any  time in case of safet y concerns or if 
special circumstances concerning the stud y medication or the compan y itself occur, making 
further treatment of subjects impossible. I n this event, the investigator(s) and relevant authorities 
will be informed of the reason for stud y termination.
3.6. End of Study
End of s tudy is defined as when the last subject has completed 24 weeks of dosing (or 48weeks 
of dosing if entering the extension period) plus the FUvisit [ADDRESS_483658] dose of stud y 
drug (if applicable) .
3.7. Post Study Care
The long term care of subjects post-study will remain the responsibility  of their primary  treating 
physician.
                                                
1In each case, there is a need for additional investigations, such as review of ethanol, recreational drug and dietary 
supplement consumption; testing for acute hepatitis A, B or C infection and biliary tract imaging should be promptly 
discussed with the st udy medical monitor .

3.8.1. Biomarker Samples to Address the Study Objectiv es
The following biological specimens will be collected in this study  and will be used to evaluate 
the assoc iation of exploratory  systemic and/or tissue specific biomarkers with study  drug 
response, including efficacy  and/or AEs, and to increase knowledge and understanding of the 
biology  ofCLE or related diseases. The specific analy ses may include, but will not be limited to, 
the assay s listed below.  
Plasma and serum samples for analy sis of circulating factors including but not limite d to 
cytokines, mi croRNA, and metabolites
Whole blood samples and vfPBMCs to assess cell phenoty pe and function
PAXgene blood samples for leukocy te gene expression analy sis
 
The biomarker sample collection schedule is described in the Study  Procedures Table 
(Appendix 2). Because biomarker science is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_204935], and AEs in 
particular are difficult to predict, it is not possible to spec
ify prospectively  all tests that will be 
done on the specimens collected . The testing outlined abo veis based upon the current state of 
scientific knowledge. It may  be modified during or after the end of the study  to remove tests no 
longer indicated and/or to add new tests based upon the growing state of art knowledge. 
Specimens will be collected from all subjects. The biomarker samples will be destroy ed no later 
than 15 y ears after the end of study .For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment 
instructions, see the Sample Handling and L

4.4. Screen Failures
Subjects who do not meet eligibility  criteria for study  entry  (“screen failures”) may  be rescreened 
one time in select cases . For example,
To adequatel y washout a concomitant medication
Administrative reasons (eg, exceeding the scree ning window due to issues with appointment 
scheduling or obtaining results of laboratory  data )
Written approval must be obtained from the sponsor prior to rescreening. R escreening may not 
be used to recheck a subject who is likely  unsuitable for the study  (for example, to check whether 
achronically  abnormal laboratory  test is closer to normal range
). 
Subjects who are permitted to rescreen must repeat the informed consent process and sign a new 
informed consent form . A new screening number will be assigned . The following test /procedure
will not need to 
be repeated (unless required per investigator judgment) if results are available 
within the appropriate timeframe :
Chest x -ray, if performed within 3 months prior to the rescreening visit

5.1. Randomization, Blinding and Treatment Codes
An Interactive Web Response Sy stem (IWRS) will be employ ed to manage subject 
randomization and treatment assignments. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that 
the subject is eligible for the study  prior to enrollment. Subjects will be assigned a screening 
number at the time of consent. 
5.1.1. Procedures for Breaking Treatment Codes
In the event of a medical e mergency  where breaking the blind is required to provide medical care 
to the subject, the investigator may  obtain treatment assignment directly  from the I WRS sy stem 
for that subject. [COMPANY_009] recommends but does not require that the investigator contact [CONTACT_110099]. Treatment assignment should remain blinded 
unless that knowledge is necessary  to determine subject emergency  medical care. The rationale 
for unblinding must be clearl y explained in source documentation and on the eCRF, along with 
the date on which the treatment assignment was obtained. The investigator is requested to 
contact [CONTACT_337351] y treatment unblinding.
Blinding of stud y treatment is critical to the integrity  of this clinical trial and therefore, if a 
subject’s treatment assignment is disclosed to the investigator, the subject will have study  
treatment discontinued. All subjects will be followed until study  completion unless consent to do 
so is specificall y withdra wn by  [CONTACT_423].

Until dispensed to the subjects, all drug products s hould be stored in a securely locked area, 
accessible only  to authorized site personnel. To ensure the stability  of the study  drugs and to 
ensure proper product identification, the drug products should not be stored in a container other 
than the containers in which they  are supplied. Consideration should be given to handling, 
preparation, and disposal through measures that minimize drug contact [CONTACT_10850] . 
Appropriate precautions should be followed to avoid direct ey e contact [CONTACT_279383].
GS-[ADDRESS_483667] should be given 
instructions to maintain approximately  the same daily  time of administration to ensure a similar 
dosing interval between study  drug doses. 
For missed dose(s) of study  medication, subjects should be instructed to take the missed dose(s) 
of study  medication as soon as possible during the same day. If the missed dose is not taken on 
the original day , subjects should be cautioned not to double the next dose with the missed dose of 
study  drug under an y circumstances. In those cases, the missed dose should be returned to the 
study  drug bottle.
5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications
All medications taken for the treatment of CLE will be recorded in the source documents and on

Live or attenuated vaccines (including, but not limited to varicella and inhaled flu vaccine) are 
prohibited within [ADDRESS_483671] with persons vaccinated with 
live/attenuated vaccine components. General guidelines suggest that a study subject’s exposure 
to household contacts should be avoided for the below stated time periods:
Varicella or attenuated typhoid fever vaccination –
avoid contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 4 weeks following 
vaccination
Oral polio vaccination - avoid contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 6 weeks following vaccination
Attenuated rotavirus vaccine -avoid contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 10 day s following vaccination
Inhaled flu vaccine - avoid contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 1 week following vaccination
Inactivated vaccines (such as inactivated flu vaccines) should be administered according to local 
vaccination standards whenever medicall y appropriate; however, there are no available data on 
the concurrent use of filgotinib or GS -[ADDRESS_483672] on immune responses following 
vaccination.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 15 October [ZIP_CODE]. ADVERSE EVENTS AND T OXICITY  MANAGEMENT
7.1. Definitions of Adverse Events, Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse 
Events
7.1.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject 
administered a medicinal product ,which does not necessarily  have a causal rela tionship with th e
treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and
/orunintended sign, sy mptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product. AEs may  also include pre -or post-treatment complications that occur as a 
result of protocol specified procedures, lack of efficacy , overdose, drug abuse/misuse reports , or 
occupational exposure . Preexisting events that increase in severit y or change in nature during or 
as a conse quence of participation in the clinical study  will also be considered AEs.
An AE does not include the following:
Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery , endoscopy , tooth extraction, andtransfusion.
The condition that led to the procedure may be anadverse event and must be reported.
Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory  abnormalities present or detected before the 
screening visit that do not worsen
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800] , social and/or convenience admissions)
Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Section 7.7.1 )
Any medical condition or clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not an 
AE. I t is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical history  
eCRF.
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at an y dose, results in the following:
Death
Life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in w hich the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe.)
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10801]-9876
Protocol GS -US-436-4092 FINAL
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 4
CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 15 October 2018Persistent or signific ant disability /incapacit y
A congenital anomal y/birth defect
A medicall y important event or reaction: such events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110080]. Medical and 
scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable 
under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive 
treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal 
product will be considered a medicall y important event and subject to expedited reporting 
requirements.
7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for 
causalit y and severity , and for final review and confirmation of accuracy  of event information 
and assessments.
7.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to 
investigational medicinal product ( IMP)therapy  using clinical judgment and the following 
considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology  other than the IMP. For SAEs, an 
alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre -existing c ondition, underl ying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).
Yes:There is reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused by [CONTACT_386044] .
It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should n ot be considered as causall y related in 
the context of adverse event reporting. 
The relationship to study  procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biops y) 
should be assessed using the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that t he adverse event has an etiology  other than the study  procedure.
Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures, (eg., venipun cture )

CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 15 October [ZIP_CODE].2.2. Assessment of Severity
The severit y of AEs will be graded using the modified Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), version 4.03. For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the highest grade attained should be 
reported.
If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: 
Grade 1(mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (sever e), Grade 4 (life -threatening) or 
Grade 5(fatal) to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event. For purposes of 
consistency  with the CTCAE, these intensity  grades are defined in 
Table 3andAppendix 4.

Grade Adjective Description
Grade 1 Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;

7.3. Investigator Requirements and Instructions for Reporting Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events to [COMPANY_009]
Requirements for collection prior to study  drug initiation:
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study  medication, the following t ypes of events 
should be reported on the eCRF: all SAEs and adverse events related to protocol- mandated 
procedures.
7.3.1. Adverse Events
Following initiation of study  medication until [ADDRESS_483682] consents to 
participate in the stud y (ie, signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the 
study , incl uding the protocol -required post treatment follow -up period, must be reported to the 
eCRF database and [COMPANY_009] DSPH as instructed. This also includes any  SAEs resulting from 
protocol -associated procedures performed after informed consent is signed.
Any SAEs and deaths that occur after the post- treatment follow -up visit but within [ADDRESS_483683] dose of study  drug, regardless of causalit y, should also be reported. 
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek SAEs after the protocol defined follow up period. 
However, if the investigator learns of any  SAEs that occur after stud y participation has 
concluded and the event is deemed relevant to the use of study  drug, he/she should promptly  
document and report the event to [COMPANY_009] DSPH.
Electronic Serious A dverse Event (eSAE) Reporting Process
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF database within the timelines outlined in the 
eCRF completion guideline. 
Site personnel record all SAE data in the eCRF database and from there transmit the SAE 
information to [COMPANY_009] DSPH within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
Detailed instructions can be found in the eCRF completion guidelines.
If for an y reason it is not possible to record the SAE information electronically , ie, the eCRF 
database is not functioning, record the SAE on the paper serious adverse event reporting 
form and submit within 24 hours to:
[COMPANY_009] DSPH: Fax:
E
-mail :
As soon as it is possible to do so, any  SAE reported via paper must be transcribed into the 
eCRF Database according to instructions in the eCRF completion guidelines.
If an SAE has been reported via a paper form because the eCRF database has been locked, no 
further action is necessary.
For fatal or life -threatening events, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autops y reports, and other 
documents are also to be submitted by  e-mail or fax when requested and applicable. 
Transmission of such documents should occur without personal subject identification, 
maintaining the tracea bility  of a document to the subject identifiers.
Additional information may  be requested to ensure the timely  completion of accurate safet y 
reports.
Any medications necessary  for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant 
medication section of the subject’s eCRF and the event description section of the SAE form.

Asymptomatic l aboratory  abnormalities are usually  not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, 
laboratory  abnormalities (eg, clinical chemistry , hematology , orurinal ysis) that require medical 
or surgical intervention or lead to study
 drug interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as 
an AE orSAE, as applicable. I n addition, laboratory  or other abnormal assessments (eg, ECG,

Severity  should be recorded and graded according to the CTCAE ( Appendix 4). For AEs 
associated with laboratory
 abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of the clinical 
severit y in the context of the underl ying conditions; this may  or may not be in agreement with 
the grading of the laboratory  abnormalit y.
7.6. Toxicity Management 
All clinical toxicities and clinically  significant laboratory  toxicities will be managed according to

Special situation reports include all reports of medication error, abuse, misuse, overdose, reports 
of adverse events associated with product complaints, pregnancy  reports regardless of an 
associate d AE, an AE in an infant following exposure from breastfeeding, and an occupational 
exposure with an AE.  
Medication error is an
y unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a 
medicinal product while in the control of the health care provider, subject, or consumer.
Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medicinal product by  a 
subject.
Misuse is defined as an y intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product that is not in 
accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information.
An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity  of a medicinal 
product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommend ed 
dose as per protocol or in the product labelling (as it applies to the daily  dose of the subject in 
question). In cases of a discrepancy  in drug accountability , overdose will be established only  
when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess dos e(s). Overdose cannot be established 
when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy  except in cases in which the investigator has 
reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s).
Occupational exposure with an AE is defined as expos ure to medicinal product as result of one's 
professional or non- professional occupation. 
Product complaint is defined as complaints arising from potential deviations in the manufacture, 
packaging, or distribution of the medicinal product.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 94 15 October 2018Appendix 5. Pregnancy Precautions, Definition sofFemale sof Childbearing 
Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements
The administration of filgotinib in embry o-fetal animal development studies resulted in 
decreased numbers of viable rat fetuses, increased resorptions, and viscer al and skeletal 
malformations. Similar effects were noted in the rabbit. A safet y margin relative to human 
exposure has not been identified. Therefore, filgotinib is contraindicated during pregnancy .
N
on-clinical reproductive toxicity  studies of GS - 9876 do not indicate a strong suspi[INVESTIGATOR_143355] y/fetotoxicity .  There are no data for GS- [ADDRESS_483707] every  4 weeks during the stud y.
1)Definitions
a.Definition of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study , a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential 
following the initiation of pubert y (Tanner stage 2) until becoming post-menopausal, 
permanentl y sterile or with medically  documented ovarian failure. Women who do not meet the 
protocol definition
sof post-menopausal, or permanently  sterile, or do not have medically  
documented ovarian failure, must have pregnancy  testing as outlined in the protocol. 
Women are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they  are > 54 years of age with 
cessation of previously  occurring menses for > 12 months without an alternative cause. In 
addition, women < 54 years of age with amenorrhea of >[ADDRESS_483708] of an y age. Bilateral tubal ligation is not considered to be 
permanent sterilization.
2)Contraception for Female Subjects
a.Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception
Filgotinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as there is a po ssibility  of human 
teratogenicit y/fetotoxicity  in earl y pregnancy based on non- clinical data. Data from a clinical 
drug-drug interaction study  of filgotinib and hormonal contraceptives demonstrated that 
filgotinib does not alter the pharmacokinetics of representative hormonal contraceptives
levonorgestrel/ethin yl estradiol .
GS-[ADDRESS_483709] at the Day  1visit prior to randomization. Pregnancy  tests will be 
performed at monthly  intervals thereafter. In the event of a delay ed menstrual period 
(>onemonth between menstruations), a pregnancy  test must be performed to rule out pregnancy . 
This is true even for women with infrequent or irregular periods. 
Female subjects of childbearing potenti al must agree to use highl y effective contraception. 
Subjects must agree to use one of the following methods from screening until [ADDRESS_483710] dose of study  drug. 
Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential. Abstinence is an acceptable 
method of contraception only  when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifesty le.
Or
Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below :
Intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of < 1 % per year
Tubal sterilization
Essure micro- insert sy stem (provided confirmation of success 3 months after procedure)
Vasectom y in the male partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner and 
had confirmation of surgical success 3 months after procedure)
Female subjects who wish to use a hormonal contraceptive must agree to use it in 
conjunction with a barrier method, preferabl y a male condom.  Female subjects who utilize a 
hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have consistently  used the 
same method for at least three months prior to study  drug dosing.  Hormonal contraceptives 
and barrier methods permitted for use in this protocol are as follows:
Barrier methods (each method must be used with a hormonal method) :
■Male condom (with or without spermicide)
■
Female condom (with or without spermicide)
■ Diaphragm with spermicide
■Cervical cap with spermicide
■ Sponge with spermicide

condom) :
■ O ral contraceptives (either combined or progesterone only )
■Injectable progesterone
■Subdermal contraceptive implant
■Transdermal contraceptive patch
■Contraceptive vaginal ring
All female subjects must also agree to refrain from egg donation and in vitro ferti lization during 
the study and until [ADDRESS_483711] study  drug dose.
3) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods
Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post- ovulation methods), withdra wal (coitus interruptus), spermicides onl y, and 
lactat ional amenorrhea method (LAM). Female condom and male condom should not be used 
together.
4) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy
Subjects will be instructed to notify  the investigator if th ey become pregnant at any  time during 
the study , or if they  become pregnant within [ADDRESS_483712] report the 
information to the investigator and disc ontinue allstudy  drug simmediatel y. 
Instructions for reporting pregnancy , and pregnancy  outcome are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
5)Pregnancy Testing
All females of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy  testing every  4weeks during the
study . During the periods where study  visits are every  6-[ADDRESS_483713].

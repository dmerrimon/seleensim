Status: Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_45755] derived from the isolation and 
ex-vivo expansion of human umbilical tissue-derived cells (hUTC) that is to be injected in the subretinal 
space of the eye of subjects with retinal degeneration. In addition to impact ingretinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] 
(RPE)cells, CNTO 2476 appears to preserve photoreceptors, and inner retinal cells.
Study CNTO2476MDG2002 is a Phase 2b study to evaluate the safety and usability profile of the 
procedure and the Delivery System , as well as to assess the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a 
single subretinal administration of CNTO 2476 at 1 of 2 doses , compared with the control.
OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS
Primary Objective s
The primary objective of the open -label Safety Run-inPhase is to evaluate the safety and performance
profile of the suprachoroidal surgical approach and the Delivery System . 
Major Secondary Objectives
The major secondary objectives of this study are the following: 
 to assess the safety and performance profile of the Delivery System , the safety and tolerability of the 
suprachoroidal surgical approach, and the safety and tolerability ofCNTO 2476 cells in the open -
label Safety Run -in Phase
 to assess the effects of CNTO 2476 on anatomic correlates of treatment, including change in the area 
of geographic atrophy (GA)
 to assess the effects of CNTO [ADDRESS_45756] 55 y ears of age and no older than 90years ,inclusive with a 
confirmed diagnosis of GA of the macula secondary to age-related macular degeneration, with associated 
vision loss, confirmed within 45days prior to initial randomization by [CONTACT_43724]/or autofluorescence , fluorescein angiography , and fundus photography . In subjects with
neovascular AMD in 1eye, the eye with GA must be the worse eye. In subjects with bilateral GA and the 
vision between both eyes not clinically equal, the eye with the worse vision will be treated in order to 
minimize risk to the subject’s vision. In cases where the BCVA of the 2 eyes is clinically equal, the eye 
with more extensive GA as demonstrated on the imaging studies will become the study eye.

Status: Approved , Date: 15 December 2017The Safety Run-in Phase consists of approximately 21subjects (the first 3 subjects at each of 
approximately 8 sites) who will first be enrolled in an open-label assessment of the safety profile of the 
procedure and the Delivery System. During the Safety Run-in Phase, subjects will receive a CNTO [ADDRESS_45757] 21subjects
(the initial Safety Cohort) have been treated and followed for a minimum period of 1month. An external 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be commissioned for this study. 
The Randomized Double -masked Treatment Phase of the study was planned to follow the DSMB’s 
evaluation of the safety phase data and its supportive recommendation to advanc e to the randomized 
Double- masked Treatment P hase. This cohort was to consist of approximately [ADDRESS_45758] of a 12-month acute phase, followed bya 2-year maximum duration follow -up 
period (3 years total) for all subjects . 
Screening Phase
Prior to the full study screening phase , optional BCVA pre -screening may be done to evaluate subject s for 
BCVA eligibility . In this case, subjects must sign an optional pre-screening informed consent form (ICF)
prior to testing. The site will determine results of local testing and indicate if the subject is eligible for full 
study screening. If the BCVA test indicates the subject meets the necessary eligibility criteria, he or she 
will enter the full screening phase after signing the full study ICF for determination of full study 
eligibility.
All subjects will be required to give written informed consent to participate in the trial. 
After giving written informed consent, subjects may be screened over a period of up to 45days prior to 
treatment to assess their eligibility for the study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined 
for this study. The screening process may occur over a period of days and need not take place in one visit . 
Patient eligibility will be determined based on the results of 2 BCVA examinations performed at the 
screening visit. These examinations can occur on the same day or subsequent days. The better of the 2 
logMAR BCVA scores will be used for eligibility and randomization. These examinations should be 
performed prior to any other ocular study procedures that might interfere with vision assessments 
(dilation, bright l ight examination etc) . 
Visual acuity tests, contrast sensitivity, MN Read, i ntraocular pressure (IOP) , slit lamp examinations 
(including lens mobility examination), microperimetry, fundus photography, spectral domain optical 
coherence tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence, and fluorescein angiography , will be 
performed forall subjects. Axial lengt h will be recorded at baseline. Indocyanin green angiography will 
be performed for all subjects unless discussed with the Sponsor.
Other assessments will include m edical history, genomic material from consented subjects, demographics, 
a targeted physical examination, vital signs, routine laboratory androutine urinalysis In addition blood 
samples for immunogenicity, medication history, concomitant medications, the NEI-VFQ-[ADDRESS_45759]

from the isolation and ex vivo expansion of human umbilical tissue -derived cells (hUTC) that is 
to be injected in the subretinal space of the ey es of subjects with retinal degeneration. In additi on 
to impact ing retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE)cells, CNTO [ADDRESS_45775] on visual function . The putative mechanisms of action of CNTO 2476 relevant to 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD )arestimulating RPE phagocytosis of rod outer 
segments , promoting RPE survival and promoting sy naptogenesis and neuron survival .
Age-related macular degeneration with geographic atroph y (AMD- GA) is a retinal degenerative
disease involving the macula. The pathogenesis of AMD, though not conclusively  defined, 
involves the loss ofphotoreceptors and RPE cells. This loss is thought to be induced by [CONTACT_43735]. The accumulation and deposition of lipofuscin and the 
formation of drusen has been associated with dysfunction and subsequent loss of RPE, resulting 
in degeneration of the overly ing photoreceptors1,6,9,4,13, and sy naptic loss and mislocalization.8,15
Biological functions of RPE cells include phagoc ytosis of rod outer segments (ROS) and 
recycling of visual cycle products. Genetic mutations that affect the normal phagocy tosis and 
visual cycle functions of the RPE cells result in significant deficiencies, underscoring their 
importance maintaining retinal homeostasis.12In particular, mutations in RPE Mer tyrosine 
kinase (MertK) and ATP -binding cassettes A4 (ABCA4) induce AMD -like retinal degeneration. 
The MertK mutation interferes with Mer receptor mediated phagocy tosis in RPE cells and causes 
retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_43697] a, another degenerative disease of the retina in human .5Mutation of lipid 
visual cycle transporter —ABCA4 in the eye increases a toxic by[CONTACT_43736], 
A2E, a component in lipofuscin, and results in early onset macular degeneration in children.[ADDRESS_45776] on photoreceptor 
function.
Animal models of AMD -GA presenting all clinical and histological signs of the human disease 
are lacking. Nevertheless, several key elements of AMD -GA pathogenesis can be identified in 
the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat model ,such as phagocy tosis and visual cycle lipid 
metabolism. The RCS rat carries the MertK mutation resulting in diminished phagocy tosis of 
ROS and leading to photoreceptor cell death .14The RPE cells from dystrophic RCS rats showed 
reduced phagocy tosis in vitro. Furthermore, deterioration of the visual cycle associated with 
disease progression was identified by [CONTACT_43737]. The visual cycle 
transporter (ABCA4) was down -regulated with disease progression over time, potentially  lead ing 
to an accumulation of A2E. This is supported by [CONTACT_43738] A2PE, a precursor of A2E, is 
increased in the RCS retina .11Therefore, the RCS rat RPE cells have functional deficits in 
phagocy tosis and visual cycle functions, which are similar to deficiencies that may lead to 
AMD -GA in humans. Finally , RCS rats exhibit early changes in synaptic connectivity  that lead 
to mislocalization and loss of synapses .2

CNTO 2476
Clinical Protocol CNTO2476MDG2002 Amendment 3
31
Status: Approved , Date: 15 December 2017Data from preclinical studies with CNTO 2476 support the hypothesis that CNTO 2476 can 
improve the phagocy tic function of dystrophic RCS RPE cells. In vitro, CNTO 2476 restored 
dystrophic RPE phagocytosis function to the level of normal RPE cells (SCI V-DR14). In vivo, 
subretinal injections of CNTO 2476 into dystrophic RCS rats led to preservation of visual 
function and photor eceptors (SCIV -DR1, SCIV-DR2). Moreover , the presence of CNTO 2476 
resulted in an increase of phagosomes in the RPE and a reduced layer of debris between the 
photoreceptor and RPE (SCO -TD-2009 -0035). This increase in phagocy tosis may lead to a 
reduction of photoreceptor apoptosis. Addition ally,in vitro studies utilizing a purified rat retinal 
ganglion cell (RGC) culture sy stem, further confirmed CNTO 2476 secrete factors that enhanced 
neuronal survival, supported neurite outgrowth and strongly  promoted excitatory  synaptic 
connectivity  (SCO -DR-2015 -0001 ). In addition, CNTO 2476 also promoted survival reduced 
apoptosis of RPE cells exposed to oxidative stress (SCO -DR-[ADDRESS_45777]-2015 -
0002 ). Finally , subretinal injections of CNTO 2476 to the RCS rat also preserved the gene 
expression of ABCA4, a visual cy cle transporter (SCO -DR-2009 -0005).

1.1. Background
1.1.1. Nonclinical Studies
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mechanism of A ction
Mechanism of action studies indicated that CNTO [ADDRESS_45779] phagocy tic function of 
dystrophic RCS retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_43698] (RPE) cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally , 
studies performed in human RPE cells demonstrated hUTC promoted survival and reduced 
apoptosis of RPE cell s exposed to oxidative stress. Finall y, in vitro studies utilizing a purified rat 
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) culture system further confirmed CNTO [ADDRESS_45780] that CNTO 2476 can potentially  improve 
vision by  [CONTACT_43739], promoting RPE survival 
and enhancing neuronal survival and function.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Profile
The disposition of hUTC were characterized with respect to persistence and systemic 
biodistribution in xenogeneic settings. These studies have indicated that following subretin al 
administration, hUTC persist for approximately  2 to 3 months. In non-target organs in RCS rats 
treated with immunosuppressants, human cell equivalents were detected by [CONTACT_43740], kidney , liver,and testis up to 14days following subretinal 
administration of hUTC. However, in a study  conducted in nude rats designed to evaluate 
systemic distribution of hUTC to the ovaries, testes, andseminal fluid, no human cells could be 
detected. Taken together, these results indicate that following subretinal administration,

Status: Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_45781] to subretinal persistence, 
systemic exposure is limited over time for CNTO 2476 .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity
The invivo immunogenicity  of umbilical tissue -derived cells was characterized following 
subretinal administration to pig s. No antibodies to pUTC or cellular immune responses were 
observed in the allogeneic setting following single or repeated subretinal administration of pUTC 
to pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. In the xenogene ic setting, following single or repeated subretinal administration of 
hUTC to pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], antibodies to hUTC developed when surgical methods used for cell administration 
caused an intentional or inadvertent retinal perforation. No antibody  responses were observe d 
when targeted subretinal delivery  of hUTC was achieved without retinal perforation. Following 
repeated subretinal delivery , focal mononuclear cell infiltrates and subretinal granulomas were 
observed at the cell administration site. In all animals with subretinal granulomas antibodies to 
hUTC were detected consistent with the premise that they were a manifestion of a xenogeneic 
immune response intended to wall off foreign antigens that were too large to phagocy tose. This 
finding was monitorable by [CONTACT_43741]  (SD-OCT ),which 
revealed resolution into small focal areas of fibrosis over time suggesting the finding was 
reversible. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology
Thetoxicology  program was conducted in rats and mini- pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. No tumorigenicity  of CNTO 2476 
was observed in nude rats following subretinal administration at a maximum feasible dose which 
corresponded to approximately  a 5-fold multiple of an efficacious dose in the RCS rat model. No 
systemic toxicity  of CNTO 2476 was observed in rats following a single intravenous dose of up 
to1.5 x 106cells (corresponding to approximately  a 5-fold multiple of an efficacious dose in the 
RCS rat model) when intravenous injection rates were limited to approximately  
1 x 106cells/minute.

1.1.2. Clinical Studies
Study CNTO2476RPG1001 was a Phase 1 open-label, noncomparative study  to evaluate the 
safet y of a single, unilateral, subretinal administration of CNTO 2476 (using a transvitreal 
approach) insubjects with advanced retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_43697] a.Seven subjects were enrol led inthe 
study and completed 5 -year follow -up. Study  CNTO2476MDG1002 is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, 
randomized, dose escalation, fellow -eye controlled study  to evaluate the safet y and clinical 
response of a single, subretinal administration of CNTO 2476 in subjects with visual acuity  
impairment associated with geographic atroph y (GA) secondary  to AMD .In September 2014, 
enrollment in this study  was discontinued but long -term follow -up is ongoing. Per the interim 
report, dated 22 January  2015, 35 subjects enrolled in the study ; 33 were evaluable for efficacy  
and safety . Among the 33 subjects, 29 were in the Phase 1 portion of the study  and 4 were in the 
Phase 2a portion of the study .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Human Pharmacokinetics
No data on pharmacology , pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of CNTO 2476 in humans are 
available.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy
Although Study  CNTO2476RPG1001 was not designed as an efficacy  study, secondary 
objectives included preliminary  evaluations of changes from baseline in retinal structure and 
visual function. Overall, changes from baseline in visual acuity  and retinal thickness were mixed. 
At the Month [ADDRESS_45783] had any 
worsening of visual acuity . At the end of the study (Month 6 0), 3 subjects reported lower visual 
acuity (ie, no light perception or a shift from hand motion tolight perception ) at Month [ADDRESS_45784] corrected visual acuit y (BCVA )for the 33 treated subjects waslog of the minimum 
angle of resolution ( logMAR ) 1.2 (20/320 )andlogMAR 0.6 (20/80) in the treated ey e and fellow

(20/250) and logMAR0.6 (20/80) inthe treated eye and fellow eye, respectivel y, suggesting an 
improvement in BCVA in the treated eye compared with no change in the fellow eye. The mean 
change from baseline was 5 letters betw een fellow and treated eye at 6months and 6.8 letters at 
12 months.

fellow ey es showing a 3-line loss in BCVA.
Recognizing the study  was designed for safet y, interim efficacy  data suggest that subretinal 
administration of CNTO 2476 may result in BCVA letter gain in some subjects with vision loss 
secondary  to GA. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety
Study CNTO2476RPG1001
This was a Phase 1 open-label, noncomparative study  to evaluate the safet y of a single, 
unilateral, subretinal administration of CNTO 2476 in7subjects with advanced retinitis 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] . 
Adverse events (AEs) observed during the study were consistent with the postoperative course 
for the surgical procedure. 
There were no adverse clinical observations suggesting an immune response in the treated 
eye. These observations suggest that a single, subretinal injection of CNTO 2476 was not 
immunogenic and did not cause an adverse immune response through 60 months after
treatment. 
Two subjects who received the targeted doses of 3.0 x 105or 5.6 x 105CNTO 2476 cells had 
serious AEs (SAEs )of retinal detachment. In these cases, the mechanism of retinal 
detachment was traction due to proliferation of RPE cells in the vitreous after retinotomy . 
This suggests that transvitreal delivery  of CNTO 2476 is not appropriate . 
Ocular and visual assessments during the 4-year safet y surveillance period remained similar to 
those noted at Month 12.

Thirty -three subjects received CNTO 2476 (29 subjects in the Phase 1 portion of the study  and 
4subjects in the Phase 2a portion of the study ) and were evaluable for safety .Of the 29 subjects 
treated in Phase 1, 28 (96.6%) had at least 1treatment -emergent AE (TEAE). The most common 
TEAEs by [CONTACT_43743] (9 subjects, 31.0%), conjunctival haemorrhage 
(7subjects, 24.1%), and hypertension (7 subjects, 24.1% ). Of the 4 subjects treated in Phase 2a, 
3 (75.0%) had at least [ADDRESS_45790] common of which were conjunctival haemorrhage and 
retinal tear (reported for 3 subjects [75.0%] each). Most AEs were considered related to the 
surgical delivery  procedure, or to various co -morbidities. Serious AEs reported for subjects from 
both the Phase [ADDRESS_45791] 
commonly  reported SAE was retinal detachment (5 of 33 subjects, 15.2%). The incidence of AEs 
and SAEs did not appear to be dose related.

1.2. Overall Rationale for hUTC Development and Delivery System Innovation
Geographic atroph yrelated to AMD is the most common cause of blindness in the developed 
world among persons over age 60; in the [LOCATION_002] (US) alone, approximately  [ADDRESS_45793] intermediate or advanced AMD, and the prevalence of GA
specificall y in person over age 40 is 0.8%, or approximately  970,000 individuals.10The 
prevalence of AMD and GA is similar in other developed nations and will increase with the 
aging of the population. There are currentl y no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_43700], including GA. 
Human umbilical tissue cells are easily available without the need to obtain or manage 
differentiation of stem cells; they are fully  differentiated and have low potential for uncontrolled 
proliferation or teratoma formation; and they are rea dily expanded in vitro. Potency  and viability  
assay s are available to ensure quality  and consistency  of scaled up manufacturing. 
Both in vitro and in vivo data indicate that hUTCs have beneficial effects on RPE cells. As 
described above, hUTCs improve RPE phagocy tic function in vitro and in vivo, with 
corresponding improvement in vision the RSC rat model. HUTCs also appear to modulate 
oxidative stress and neuroplasticity , factors which are disordered in GA. 
Furthermore, Phase [ADDRESS_45794] important 
factor in the development of this program, and delivery  of viable cells in the subretinal space 
requires some type of surgical procedure . Experience in the clinic has shown that leakage or 
reflux of cells into the vitreous may lead to proliferation of cells with membrane formation with 
to traction and retinal detachment. Thus, delivery  of CNTO 2476 to the subretinal space without 
a break to the retina is of paramount importance. In the Phase 1 study , the iScience microcatheter

37
Status: Approved , Date: 15 December 2017delivery  system was used with an ab externo surgical approach. That approach was found to be 
challenging, requiring 2 operators, and resulting in anunacceptable rate of retinal tears and 
retinal detachments. That surgical approach is inadequate for further development.
Given the limitations of the iScience MDS, a newly  developed Delivery  Systemwill be utilized 
in thisPhase 2b study . The Delivery  System was developed to facilitate delivery  of CNTO 2476 
cells to the targeted perimacular subretinal delivery  site via a suprachoroidal approach .The 
suprachoroidal surgical procedure was selected and the new Delivery  System was developed 
with the goal of improving the delivery  device and procedure usability  and facilitating the safe 
targeted delivery  of CNTO 2476 .
The Delivery  System is being developed in accordance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR)Part 4, Current Good Manufacturing Practice regul ations for Combination Products, 
including [ADDRESS_45795] Manual.
2. OBJECTIVES A ND HYPOT HESES
2.1. Objectives
Primary Objectives
The primary  objective of the open -label Safet y Phase is to evaluate the safet y and performance
profile of the supr achoroidal surgical approach and the Delivery  System. 
Major Secondary Objectives
The major secondary  objectives of this study  are the following: 
to assess the safet y and performance profile of the Delivery  System, the safet y and 
tolerability  of the supra choroidal surgical approach, and the safet y and tolerability  of 
CNTO 2476 cells in the open-label Safet y Run -in Phase .
to assess the effects of CNTO 2476 on anatomic correlates of treatment, including change in 
the area of GA

including duration of clinical response.
2.2. Hypothesis
The primary  hypothesis of theopen label safet y phase of this study  is that the novel subretinal 
delivery  system is sufficiently  safe and usable to deliver cells to the subretinal space. An 
additional hy pothesis is that palucorcel is safe and well tolerated when delivered as a single dose 
to the subretinal space.
3. STUDY DESIGN A ND RA TIONA LE
3.1. Overview  of Study  Design
This is a multicenter Phase 2b study . A target of approximately  21 subjects will be enrolled in 
this study . This protocol amendment represents a significant reduction in scope and duration of 
the study  based on the sponsor ’s decision to discontinue the pal ucorcel development program.
The study  includes only an initial open -label safety  phase . 
The target population will be subjects at least 55 years of age and no older than 90yearswith a 
confirmed diagnosis of bilateral GA of the macula secondary  to age-related macular 
degeneration, with associated vision loss, confirmed within 45days prior to initial randomization 
by [CONTACT_43744]/or autofluorescence photography . In subjects with 
neovascular AMD in 1eye, the eye with GA must be the worse eye. In subjects with bilateral 
GA and the vision between both ey es is not clinically equal, the ey e with the worse vision will be 
treated in order to minimize risk to the subject’s vision. In cases where the BCVA of the 2eyes 
is clinically equal, the eye with the larger GA as demonstrated on the imaging studies will 
become the stud y eye.
The Safet y Run-in Phase consists of approximately  21subjects (the first 3subjects at each of 
approximately  8sites) who will first be enrolled in an open-label assessment of the safety  profile 
of the procedure and the Delivery  System.The first [ADDRESS_45796] 8sites (approximately 
21subjects in total) will be the initial Safet y Cohort. A minimum of s even different surgeons are 
required to ensure most of the possible failure modes will be identified.16Enrollment will be 
activel y managed to ensure that experience and learning from earlier procedures are promptly  
transferred to the subsequent procedures, and to ensure that an appropriate number of subjects 
are enrolled at the time of the planned safet y assessments.
The safet y profile of the procedure and the Delivery  System will be assessed after the first 
21subjects (the initial Safety  Cohort) have been treated and followed for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_45797] (DSMB )will be commissioned for this 
study .The 2ndSafet y Cohort and thedouble blind portion of this study have been eliminated 
from this study  protocol.
The study  will consist of a 12-month acute phase, followed bya 2-year maximum duration 
follow -up period ( 3years total) for all subjects.

Status: Approved , Date: 15 December 2017Long -term Follow -UpPhase
After the 12-month acute phase of the study , subjects will be followed every  6  m onths for 
2years in the Long -term Follow -up Phase of the study ,as shown in the Time and Events 
Schedule (see Table 2 ).
A DSMB will be established to monitor study  data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing
safet y of the subjects enrolled in this study .Refer to Section 11.6, Data and Safety  Monitoring 
Board , for details. The committee will meet periodically  to review interim study  data. After the 
review, the DSMB will make recommendations regarding the safet y and continuation of the 
study . The details will be provided in a separate DSMB charter.
3.2. Study Design Rationale
This protocol amendment represents a significant reduction in the scope and duration of the 
planned trial, based on thesponsor’s decision to discontinue the palucorcel development 
program. The intent of the current study  design is to ensure adequate long-term safet y follow -up 
of the subjects previously  enrolled, while minimizing the visit burden on subjects and 
investigators.
The target population for this study  is adult subjects (at least 55 years of age and no older than 
90years) with GA of the retina secondary  to age related macular degeneration, with a baseline 
visual acuit y of approximately  logMAR 0.6 (20/80) to logMAR 1.6 (20/800) . The best visual 
acuity of logMAR 0.6 (20/80) was selected because in this range, vision is compromised to a 
degree that restricts certain activities of daily living, and the potential benefit to the subjects 
justifies risks associated with the procedure and treatment. 
A critical requirement of the program is the ability to deliver viable cells safely  and efficientl y to 
the subretinal space, without damaging the retina, and without leakage of cells into the vitreous. 
Currently , there is no alternative to surgical delivery . Previous studies using a transvitreal 
approach or an ab externo surgical approach have led to an unacceptable rate of retinal tears and 
detachments. The new suprachoroidal surgical procedure was selected and the new Delivery 
System desig ned with the goal of simplify ing the procedure and facilitating the safe targeted 
delivery  of CNTO 2476.
The use of the Delivery  Systemin the Safety  Cohort is a first-in-man study  and AEs and device 
quality  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_43745] e first [ADDRESS_45800] been treated (or 
sooner, if a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_43701]).
Dose Selection
The breadth of the dose range is constrained by [CONTACT_43746] y during cryopreservation and the 
minimal volumes that can be accuratel y administered to minimize the detachment at the 
subretinal injection site; the feasible doses were all studied in the Phase 1/2a study . The greatest 
experience to date is with the 3.0 x 105cell dose (15 subjects). Although that dose was 
administered in a 27 µL volume in the prior study , there is no reason to believe that the volume 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
CNTO 2476
Clinical Protocol CNTO2476MDG2002 Amendment 3
41
Status: Approved , Date: 15 December 2017of administration is relevant to either safety  or efficacy ; the AEprofile for this dose/volume 
combination is comparable to a smaller dose ( 6.0 x 104cells) given in a 50 µL volume.
3.2.1. Control
The open- label phase of this study  does not require a control group. 
3.2.2. Masking
The open- label phase of this study  does not require masking .
3.2.3. Randomization
The open- label phase of this study  does not require randomization.
3.2.4. Primary Outcome Measure
Change in BCVAis considered meaningful to patients and has been accepted by [CONTACT_43747] (FDA )as an approvable endpoint in trials of therapeutic agents for 
AMD. In addition, BCVA reflects holistically  both the potential benefits (gain in visua l acuit y 
from therap y) and harms (loss of visual acuit y due to AEs). Assessment of BCVA is known to be 
partly  effort-dependent, and every  effort will be made to standardize these assessments. The 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy  Study (ETDRS )chart at 4 meters is considered the ‘gold 
standard’ for visual acuity  testing in clinical research for its phy sical and statistical properties.

The Time and Events Schedule lists the dayassoci ated with each visit until Day 15, and then the 
month associated with each visit through Month 12, and Month 18 through Month 36 of the 
long-term follow -up phase . From Day 7 through Month 6a visit window of ±3business days 
will be allowed; for the Month 12 visit, a visit window of ±7 days will be allowed. From 
Month 18 through Month 36 a visit wind owof ±2weeks (14days) will be allowed. The data on 
the visit should alway s be calculated from the baseline visit, and not from the prior visit.
All visit-specific, PRO assessments should be performed before any tests, procedures, or other 
consultations for that visit to prevent influencing subject perceptions .
The BCVA, l ow luminance BCVA (LLBCVA) ,and contrast sensitivity  will all be performed 
using a valida ted testing protocol . BCVA is the best vision one can achieve with best correction
ETDRS acuity  testing , and is a done using a standard ETDRS chart for visual acuit y testing.
The MN Read will be used to determine reading speed (RS, [measured in characters per 
minute]), critical print size (CPS, [measured in logMAR]), as well as RA (measured in 
logMAR). 
Microperimetry  will be performed using the MAIA2 system measuring the sensitivity  in 
decibels . 
New technology  assessments, eg,Optical Coherence Tomography  Angiograph y (OCT- A) and 
intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography ,may be performed at the surgeon or 
investigator’s discretion but do not substitute for any of the mandato ry evaluations listed in this 
protocol.
A standard full ophthalmology  examination will be performed and will include IOP, slit lamp 
examinations, and dilated fundus examinations. The order of multiple ophthalmologic 
assessments within 1 protocol time point will be the same throughout the study .

12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety  information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
[CONTACT_23824]. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_43765].
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a medicinal 
(investigational or non-investigational) product. An AEdoes not necessarily  have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product (definition per theInternational 
Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) .
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects AEs starting with the signing of the ICF(refer to Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_45828] AErecording).
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
CNTO 2476
Clinical Protocol CNTO2476MDG2002 Amendment 3
60
Status: Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_45829] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43714] 1of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
These should usually  be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between CNTO 2476, the delivery  system, or the device and the event, the event 
must be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a 
component of the stud y endpoint.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safet y Information
An AEis considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable 
product reference safet y information. For CNTO 2476 , the expectedness of an AEwill be 
determined b y whether or not it is listed in the Investigator's Brochure.
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug
An AEis considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, probable, or 
very likely by [CONTACT_43766] 12.1.2 .
The surgical procedure and delivery  of CNTO 2476 result in a small retinal detach ment per 
procedure guidelines. This in itself should not be listed as an adverse event.
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Not Related
An AEthat is not related to the use of CNTO 247 6, or the Delivery  System.
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
CNTO 2476
Clinical Protocol CNTO2476MDG2002 Amendment 3
61
Status: Approved , Date: 15 December 2017Doubtful
An AEfor which an alternative explanation is more likely , eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An AEthat might be due to the use of CNTO 2476 , or the Delivery  System . An alternative 
explanation, eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in 
time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An AEthat might be due to the use of CNTO 2476 , or the Delivery  System . The relationship in 
time is suggestive. An alternative explanation is less likely , eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s).
Very Likely
An AEthat is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_43767], eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time 
is very  suggestive .
12.1.3. Severity Criteria 
An assessment of severity  grade will be made using the following general categorical 
descriptors:
Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity .
Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents normal every day activities.
The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly  
experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory  abnormalities).
12.2. Special Reporting Situations
Safety events of interest for CNTO 2476 that may require expedited reporting and/or safet y 
evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
Overdose 
Inadvertent or accidental exposure 
Medication error (with or without subject exposure to CNTO 2476, eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a SAE should be recorded on the SAE page of the CRF.

16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations
Age-related macular degeneration is a debilitating and common cause of blindness in persons over 
60 years of age. For GA, the severe dryform of AMD, there is no approved therapy . Preliminar y 
clinical data suggests that CNTO 2476 may  improve visual acuit y in patients with GA.
The primary  risk is related to the novel delivery  procedure and subretinal access ki t; there may  also 
be risk associated with the cell therapy . For this reason, the study  is designed with an open -label 
Safet y Run-in Phase andSafet y Cohort to ensure safety of the surgical procedure prior to the 
randomized portion of the study ; an independ ent DSMB will provide oversight through the first 
12months of the study . Extensive training for proper use of the subretinal access kit will be 
provided to all surgeons, and all procedures will be monitored by  [CONTACT_43770].
In addition t o adherence to Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs) , the study  will also follow Good Tissue 
Practices (GTPs) to maximize and manage the safety  of injected human cells. Subjects will be 
asked to be followed for up to 36months to assess the long-term safety  outcomes of the cell 
therapy .
Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study  and, during the 
study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue 
participation. They  will be told that their consent to participate in the study  is voluntary  and may  be 
withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and 
potential AEs of the study , and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled. Consent will be 
provided in a format thatis accessible to subjects with severe visual impairment.
The total blood volume to be collected isapproximatel y107.[ADDRESS_45841] population over the time period (3years) proposed for 
this study , and is within the range of Red Cross blood donations.
16.2. Regulatory  Ethics Compliance
16.2.1. Investigator Responsibili ties
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study  is performed in accordance with the 
protocol, current ICH guidelines on GCP, GTP, and applicable regulatory  and country -specific 
requirements.
Good Clinical Practice is an international ethic al and scientific qualit y standard for designing, 
conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety , and well -being of 
study  subjec ts are protected, consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of 
Helsinki ,and that the study  data are credible.

16.2.3. Informed Consent
Each subject must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of the 
study  has been fully  explained. The ICF(s) must be signed before performance of any 
study -related activity . The ICF(s) that is/areused must be approved by [CONTACT_43771]/I RB and be in a language that the subject can read and understand. The 
informed consent should be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration of 
Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory  requirements, and sponsor 
policy .
Before enrollment in the study , the investigator or an authorized member of the study -site 
personnel must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study ,and any discomfort participation in the study  may entail. 
Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary  and that they may withdraw 
consent to participate at any time. They  will be informed that choosing not to participate wil l not 
affect the care the subject will receive. Finally , they will be told that the investigator will 
maintain a subject identification register for the purposes of long-term follow -up if needed and 
that their records may be accessed by [CONTACT_43772], to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_43773](s) or regulations. By [CONTACT_23842], including

the ICFmust be given to the subject.
Subjects will be asked for consent to provide optional samples for research where local 
regulations permit. After informed consent for the study  is appropriatel y obtained, the subject 
will be asked to sign and personall y date a separate ICFindicating agreement to participate in the 
optional research component . Refusal to participate in the optional research will not result in 
ineligibility  for the stud y.A cop y of this signed ICF will be given to the subject.
If the subject is unable to read or write, an impartial witness should be present for the entire 
informed consent process (which includes reading and explaining all written information) and 
should personally  date and sign the ICFafter the oral consent of the subject is obtained.
All study  sites will be asked by [CONTACT_43775] a validated 
electronic system instead of a pape r-based process. If both parties (sponsor and the study  site) 
agree, and if participation is allowed by [CONTACT_43776]/IRB requirements, the means 
to facilitate such a process will be provided to the sites by [CONTACT_3211]. The actual mechanism of 
consenting will be facilitated by  [CONTACT_43777] (eg, iPad®), but overall the consent 
process will remain the same, as described in this section. At these study  sites, subjects will still 
be required to review the entire informed consent as a written document on the eTablet and then 
to apply  their handwritten signature [CONTACT_43790] y by [CONTACT_2224] a st ylus directly  onto the eTablet. 
16.2.4. Privacy of Personal Data
The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be 
limited to those data that are necessary  to fulfill the objectives of the study .
These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentialit y 
and compliance with applicable data privacy  protection laws and regulations. Appropriate 
technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized 
disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be 
put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal data agree to 
keep the identit y of subjects confidential.
The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the processing of 
personal data and for the investigator /institution to allow direct access to his or her original 
medical records (source data/documents) for study -related monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, 
and regulatory  inspection. This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities 
and to other countries.
The subject has the r ight to request through the investigator access to his or her personal data and 
the right to request rectification of any data that are not correct or complete. Reasonable steps 
will be taken to respond to such a request, taking into consideration the natu re of the request, the 
conditions of the study , and the applicable laws and regulations.

17.5. Case Report Form Completion
Case report forms are provided for each subject in an electronic format. 
Electronic Data Capture (eDC) will be used for this study . The study  data will be transcribed by 
[CONTACT_3449] -sitepersonnel from the source documents onto an electronic eCRF, and transmitted in a 
secure manner to the sponsor within the timeframe agreed upon between the sponsor and the 
study  site. The electronic file will be considered to be the eCRF.
Worksheets and intraoperative videos may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate 
completion of the eCRF (ie,data collection during cell delivery  procedure) .Any such worksheets 
and videos will become part of the subject's source documentation. All data relating to the study 
must be recorded in CRFs prepared by [CONTACT_456] . Data must be entered into CRFs in English.
Study site personnel must complete the CRF as soon as possible after a subject visit, and the 
forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit.
All subjective measurements (eg, PROquestionnaires) will be completed by [CONTACT_43784]. The investigator must verify
that all data entries in the CRF s are accurate and correct.
All CRF entries, corrections, and alteratio ns must be made b y the investigator or other authorized 
study -site personnel. If necessary , queries will be generated in the eDC tool.
If corrections to a CRF are needed after the initial entry  into the CRF, this can be done in 
3different way s:
Study site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a 
response to an auto query (generated b y the eDC tool) .
Study site manager can generate a query  for resolution by  [CONTACT_1758] -site personnel.
Clinical data manager can generate a query  for resolution by  [CONTACT_1758] -site personnel.

handling, storage, and shipment of samples.
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -sitepersonnel before 
the start of the study .The sponsor will review eCRFs for accuracy  and completeness during 
on-site monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; any  discrepancies will be resolved 
with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database 
they will be verified for accuracy  and consistency  with the data sources.
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section [ADDRESS_45846] of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applicatio ns in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody  must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investig ator relocate or dispose of any study  
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor .
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such 
reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor /designee will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently  as necessary . The 
monitor will record dates of the visits in a study  site visit log that will be kept at the study  site.
The first post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At 
these visits, the monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43718] (source documents). The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to 
ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor 
and study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If

The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be 
available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be 
provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a 
regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.
Thesponsor will cond uct on-site monitoring and support on Day 1 of the study , and throughout 
the surgical procedure . Representatives from the sponsor compan y, Janssen and/or its designees 
may be present at the clinical facility , in the operating room during surgery  or observi ng 
remotely . This is to ensure oversight of aspects of the surgical procedure and protocol .
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion
The study  is considered completed with the last study  assessment for the last subject 
participating in the study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or 
designee) after completion of the final subject assessment at that study  site, in the time frame 
specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.
17.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study  completion. A
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the i ntended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of astudy site by [CONTACT_11004]:

Anticipated Event
An anticipated event is an adverse event (serious or non -serious) that commonly occurs as a consequence 
of the underlying disease or condition under investigation (disease related) or background regimen.
For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events: 
 Fatal and non- fatal myocardial infarction
 Angina pectoris
 Fatal and non- fatal stroke
 Transient ischemic attack
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COPD exacerbation and chronic bronchitis
Reporting of Anticipated Events
These events will be captu red on the CRF and in the database, and will be reported to the sponsor as 
described in Section 12.3.1 , All adverse event s. Any event that meets serious adverse event criteria will 
be reported to the sponsor within the appropriate timeline as described in Section 12.3.2, Serious 
Adverse Events . These anticipat ed events are exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases 
to Health Authorities. However ,if based on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event 
is possibly related to study drug, the sponsor will report these events in an expedited manner.
Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC)
An Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) will be established to perform reviews of pre-specified 
anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a safety committee within the sponsor’s organization 
that is independent of the sponsor’s study team. The ARC will meet to aid in the recommendation to the 
sponsor’s study team as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that an anticipated event is related to 
the study drug.
Statistical Ana lysis
Details of statistical analysis of anticipated events, including the frequency of review and threshold to 
trigger an aggregate analysis of anticipated events will be provided in a separate Anticipated Events 
Safety Monitoring Plan (ASMP).

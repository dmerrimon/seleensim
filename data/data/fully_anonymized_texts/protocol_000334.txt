Protocol Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Efficacy, 
Tolerability, Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Single Doses of DFN -
[ADDRESS_156241] -Surgical Dental Pain.  
Study Drug/  
Investigational 
Product : 1. DFN -15 (celecoxib oral solution, 25 mg/mL) - Test product  
2. Placebo of DFN -15 (oral solution, 0 mg/mL of celecoxib)  
DFN -15 and placebo will be supplied in bottles containing a deliverable 
volume of 4.8 mL solution.  
Doses of DFN -15 (62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg) and placebo will be 
allocated on site for each subject by [CONTACT_137555] g the appropriate  amounts 
of DFN -15 and /or placebo solutions into syringes , based on each 
subject randomized treatment arm . Regardless of DFN -15 dose, t he 
total volume administered to each randomized subjec t will be the 
same (10 ml) given as a single oral dose  to ensure blinding is 
maintained . 
Country:  [LOCATION_002] of America  
Phase:  2 
Primary Objective:  To assess the analgesic efficacy of DFN -15 in acute pain (post -
operative pain following extraction of bilateral mandibular third 
molars), when administered as a single dose of 62.5 mg, 125 mg or 
250 mg, as compared to placebo.  
Number of 
Subjects:  An adequate number of subjects will be screened in order to 
randomize 120 subjects into the study. Subjects who discontinue 
study participation after randomization and prior to completing the 
study will not be replaced.  
Trial Design:  This is a randomized, do uble -blind, placebo -controlled parallel design 
study, to be conducted at 1 -3 centers in the [LOCATION_002]. Male and 
female subjects, 18 to 60 years old (inclusive), who are scheduled to 
undergo elective bilateral lower third molar extraction  will be 
enroll ed.  Subjects who  meet all of the inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria  in the protocol will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
in a double -blind fashion to receive a single oral dose of either DFN -15 
62.5 mg, DFN -15 125 mg, DFN -15 250 mg or matching placebo.   
Subjects will undergo a screening procedure (within [ADDRESS_156242] molars) that will involve

serology, coagulation parameters, serum chemistry and  urinalysis), 
12-lead ECG and a  panoram ic x-ray to document the impacted 
mandibular third molar teeth.  
At screening and upon admission /Check -in (Day 1) to the clinic, prior 
to dental surgery, subjects will be screene d for alcohol consumption 
and illicit  drug use by [CONTACT_137556], 
respectively.  
As a pre -requisite for randomization, subjects will be required to 
report “moderate” to “severe” baseline pain on the provided paper 
diary with in [ADDRESS_156244] -surgery (Baseline period) as characterized on a 
4-point categorical pain intensity  (PI)  scale (0= none, 1= mild, 2= 
moderate, 3= severe), and a score of ≥5, on the 11 -point Numerical 
Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) where 0 represents ‘no pain’ and 10 
represents ‘worst pain imaginable’. Eligible subjects will be 
randomized and will receive a single dose of the assigned study 
treatment (a total volume of 10 mL). The start time of dosing will be 
recorded as T0.  Subjects will be randomized and administered  the 
study medication within [ADDRESS_156245] -operative 
inclusion criteria (baseline score).    
Subjects with inadequately controlled pain symptoms may request 
rescue analgesic medication.  The rescue medication for this study will 
be 1 -2 oxy codone 5 mg/acetamino phen [ADDRESS_156246]

ensure that all subjects und erstand the relevant scales and 
assessments prior to study participation. At study medication 
administration, two stopwatches  will be started , to measure times to 
‘perceptible’ and ‘meaningful’ pain -relief. Subjects will be instructed to 
stop the first sto pwatch when they first perceive pain relief to occur 
(time to perceptible relief). Subjects will be instructed to stop the 
second stopwatch when they first experience meaningful pain relief 
(time to meaningful relief). Stopwatch times of perceptible relief  and

following assessments, in order:  
1. Pain intensity using the 11 -point Numerical Pain Rating Scale 
(NPRS).  
Followed by:  
2. Pain relief (PR) using a 5 -point categorical scale (where 0= no 
pain relief, 1= little pain relief, 2= some pain relief, 3= a lot of 
pain relief, 4= complete pain relief)  
In addition, at [ADDRESS_156249] use 
of rescue medication (whichever is earlier), subject s will be asked to 
record within the provided patient diary:  
1. ‘Patient Rating of Treatment S atisfactoriness’ using a 5 -point 
verbal rating scale (0 =poor, 1 =fair, 2 =good, 3=very good, 4

biochemistry and urinalysis parameters) will be conducted.   
All subjects will have blood drawn at specified time points for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be 
drawn immediately prior to dosing a nd at [ADDRESS_156256] -dose , to estimate the 
concentrations of celecoxib, using a validated LC -MS/MS method. 
Whenever the times of PK blood sample collection coincide with the 
efficacy or safety a ssessments, the PK sample may be drawn within ± 
[ADDRESS_156257] hour and within ± [ADDRESS_156258] clock time 
of sam ple collection will be recorded and used in the PK analysis.  
Subjects will return to the research center 7 days ( ± 3 days) post -
surgery for evaluation of their safety and well -being. Any  AEs 
experienced post -surgery  will be reviewed.  A physical examination, of 
the subject will be performed , 12-lead ECG, and vital signs parameters  
will be repeated.  Hematology, coagulation parameters, serum 
biochemistry and urinalysis parameters will be repeated  only if there 
is a clinically significant abnormality or ongoing AE(s) . Any changes to 
the prior and concomitant medication made after discharge will be 
reviewed and recorded.  
Treatment:  A single dose of total volume of 10 mL of oral solution will be 
administered providing DFN -15 (62. 5 mg, 125 mg or 250 mg) or 
placebo . The dose will be prepared by a designated unblinded 
pharmacist at site, as per the randomization schedule. Designated 
blinded study staff will dose subjects and administer study 
assessments. Blinded study staff will rema in blinded to the dose 
administered to each subject throughout the study .  
Study Duration:  The duration of study participation will be approximately 39 days, for 
randomized subjects, including a screening period of approximately 
4 weeks, surgery and treatment period day (subjects will be confined

Version  2.0 – [ADDRESS_156295]. Reddy’s Laboratories, Limited  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_137525] -15, a new formulation of celecoxib 
[p-[5-p-Tolyl -3-(Trifluoromethyl) pyrazol -1-yl] benzene sulfonamide] for the indications 
of: (1) acute treatment of migraine with or without aura, and (2) management of acute pain 
in adults.  This study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetic properties of dosing with three doses of  DFN -15 (c elecoxib; 62.5 mg, 
125 mg, and 250  mg) in a postoperative pain population.  A single -dose, dose ranging 
design using the oral surgery model will be used to provide useful data in terms of 
analgesic onset, single -dose duration  of analgesia , and effect size of pain-time curves 
during an [ADDRESS_156296] a low risk of abuse and dependence2.  
NSAIDs, such as celecoxib, that sele ctively inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -2) target the 
prostaglandins (synthesized via COX -2) responsible for inflammation and pain while 
sparing the prostaglandins responsible for maintenance and protection of the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract (synthesized inv olving COX -1)3. The analgesic efficacy of 
COX -[ADDRESS_156297] bone fusion and

DFN -15 (Celecoxib Oral solution) is a new liquid oral formulation of the selective 
inhibitor of the type 2 (inducible) isoform of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, celecoxib.  
Celecoxib is approved as an oral capsule formulation, Celebrex®, for the management of 
acute pain in adults. DFN -15 conta ins celecoxib in solution at concentration of 25 mg 
per mL , and is  formulated using self -micro -emulsifying Drug Delivery System 
(SMEDDS) technology for quicker absorption . In comparative bioavailability studies in 
healthy subjects, Celebrex was seen to rea ch peak plasma concentrations at 
approximately 3 hours (T max)13, whereas, the DFN -15 oral liquid formulation has a more 
rapid celecoxib absorption rate leading to a higher peak plasma concentration within one 
hour.  Moreover, DFN -15 provides higher systemic  exposure (as determined by [CONTACT_137562], AUC 0-2h) than Celebrex®, [ADDRESS_156298] 2 hours after 
dosing ( Pharmacokinetic results from studies DFN -15-CD-008, DFN -15-CD-003, as 
presented in DFN -15 Investigator Brochure edition 3.0 ). On account of the unique 
physic o-chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics of DFN -15, it is expected to 
provide a quicker onset of analgesia and better relief early on in acute pain, such as post -
surgical pain.

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 26 of 81 2. STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
The primary objective of the study would be to evaluate the analgesic efficacy  of 
celecoxib at three dose levels of DFN -15 (62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg) in comparison 
to placebo  and to determine the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib from different doses , in 
acute post -surgical dental pain.  
The secondary objective of the study would be to evaluate the tolerability and safety of 
single doses of DFN -[ADDRESS_156300]. Reddy’s Laboratories

Version  2.0 – [ADDRESS_156301] involve a full or partial bony impaction confirmed by 
[CONTACT_99423]  (panoramic x -ray). 
After signing the informed consent : demographics, medical /medicinal  history, physical 
examination  (including height , weight  and BMI) , dental examination, baseline  clinical  
laboratory testing, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, urine 
pregnancy testing  (females of child bearing potential)  and urine drug and alcohol screen  
will be completed during the screening visit.  
On the day of surgery (Day 1), prior to surgery, eligibility will be confirmed through 
updating medic al/medicinal history, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign 
measurements, urine pregnancy testing (females of child bearing potential), urine drug 
and alcohol screen, and review of inclusion exclusion criteria.  A patient training 
program will be implemented to ensure that all subjects understand the relevant scales 
and assessments prior to study participation.  Eligible subjects will undergo bilateral 
mandibular third molar extractions.  Subjects who experien ce acute postoperative pain 
of ‘moderate ’ to ‘severe ’ intensity , on a 4 -point categorical pain intensity scale (0= none, 
1= mild, 2=  moderate , 3= severe ), within 6 hours following the end of su rgery, and a 
pain intensity ≥ 5  on an 11 -point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), will be eligible for 
randomization and will stay at the study center for at least approximately 8 hours after 
treatment initiation.  
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria in the protocol  
will be randomized in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_156302] s ubjects stay overnight at the study center .  An 11-point numerical pain rating scale 
(NPRS)  will be used to determine the intens ity of pain , 0-10 where 0 is ‘no pain ’ and 10 
is ‘worst  imaginable pain ’.  NPRS

5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after study drug administration (T 0). Also at these time points, Pain 
Relief (PR) will be assessed using a 5 - point categorical scale.  (where 0= no pain relief, 
1= little pain relief, 2= some pain relief, 3= a lot of pain relief, 4= complete pain relief) . 
Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS)  and pain relief (PR) assessments  will also be 
completed before taking any dose of rescue medication , and at time of early 
discontinuation  (if it occurs) .  The time to first perceptible pain relief and time to 
meaningful p ain relief will b e determined using the ‘two stop watch ’ method.  Subjects 
will also complete a  Patient Rating of Treatment satisfactoriness  at 8 hours aft er 
treatment initiation (prior to discharge from the clinical research center) , or immediately 
prior to the time of first rescue analgesic administration , or at time of early 
discontinuation .  Serial vital signs and 12  lead ECG will be done as indicated in Section 
6.4. 
For time points where several procedures are scheduled, the following sequence will be 
followed:  12-lead ECG, Vital signs, Pain assessments (where applicable) , PK blood draw , 
clinical labora tory (where applicable) . 
Subjects with inadequately controlled pain symptoms may request 1-2 oxycodone 5 mg/  
acetaminophen 325 mg q 4 h as needed  as rescue analgesic medication .  For subjects 
who require additional analgesia, additional analgesic medication may be administered 
per the surgeon’s standard of care.   
Post rescue analgesic administration, subject s will continue completing pain assessments 
until [ADDRESS_156304] study drug 
administration before utilizing rescue analgesia, if possible.  As much as possib le, rescue 
analgesic medication should be administered only if pain intensity ( PI) prior to rescue is 
≥4 on the numerical rating scale.  
A maximum of  twelve 4  mL blood samples will be taken fro m each partic ipant at baseline 
and 15, 30 , and 45 minutes,  and a t 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6,  and 8 hours  after study drug 
administration for analysis of plasma celecoxib concentrations. Whenever the times of PK 
blood sample collection coincide with the efficacy or safety assessments, the PK sample 
may be drawn within ± [ADDRESS_156305] hour and within ± [ADDRESS_156306] clock time of sample collection will be recorded and 
used in the PK analysis.  
Subjects will be asked to return to the study site 7 days ( ±3 days) post -surgery for 
evaluation of their safety and well -being. A review of AEs experienced post -surgery, a 
physical examination,  12-lead ECG, and vital signs  will be rep eated.  Hematology, serum 
biochemistry , coagulation  and urinalysis parameters will be repeated  only if there is a 
clinically significant abnormality or ongoing AE(s) . Any changes to the prior and 
concomitant medication that are made after discharge will be reviewed and recorded.  
Efficacy assessment s will include numerical pain rating scale  (NPRS ) for pain intensity , 
pain relief  (PR) , use of rescue medication,  and Patient Rating of Treatment

DFN -15 and matching placebo are packaged in amber -colored glass bottles containing 4.8 
mL solution per bottle (120 mg)  and equipped with child -resistant and tamper -evident 
caps.   
A 6-month accelerated and [ADDRESS_156328] for the clinical study will be continued to be 
supported with  appropriate stability testing for the duration of any clinical study.  
The DFN -15 formulation and the matching placebo are manufactured for the Reddy’s 
Laboratories Limited by:  [CONTACT_137568], [ADDRESS_156329]. Reddy’s by:  
[CONTACT_137569], Ltd., Narasapuram Village, Nakkapally Mandal, Vishakhapatnam, Andhra 
Pradesh, India.  Manufacturing of the study drug was performed accordin g to Good 
Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products and all relevant regulatory requireme nts. 
5.5. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
A computer -generated randomization scheme will be prepared prior to study initiation.  
Subjects will be rando mly assigned to treatment with DFN -15 62.5  mg, DFN -15 125 
mg, DFN -15 25 0 mg, or placebo  in a 1:1:1 :1 assignment ratio according to the 
randomization scheme.  All study doses administered will be according to the treatment 
assignment.  Male and female subjects (approximate ratio of 1:1)  who meet all of the 
inclusion criteria (including postoperative inclus ion criteria) and none of the exclusion 
criteria  will be stratified.  
5.6. Selection of Doses  
The selection of doses of DFN -15 to be evaluated in this exploratory study is based upon 
pharmacokinetic modelling using data from PK studies of DFN -15 in healthy subj ects, 
and from the exposure -pain intensity response relationship that is reported for 
Celebrex® in acute pain.   
5.7. Selection of Timing of Dose  
Subjects will receive a single dose of study medication.  Study drug  will be administered 
if the subject achieves ad equate pain symptoms (i.e. NPRS ≥5  out of 10 and pain of 
‘moderate ’ or ‘severe ’ intensity  on a 4 -point categorical pain intensity scale ) to be 
randomized in the study.  The exact time of study drug administration  start will be 
recorded in the subject’s CRF .   
5.8. Blinding and Unblinding of Study Medications  
All doses administered in this study will be under double -blind conditions; both the 
subject and the investigator/site staff directly involved with the surgery, or 
efficacy/safety/ PK assessments and the Sponsor personnel,  will be blinded to the 
treatment a ssignment.

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – [ADDRESS_156331]  will pull solution  from each 
of the four bottles into each of the four 2.5 mL dosing sy ringes, and provide the blinded 
dosing syringes containing the oral solution dose  to the blinded  staff member/s , who will 
administer the study medication as per Section  5.3. 
The study site will be provided with  individually sealed envelopes identifying the study 
medication each subject receives in the study.  The treatment for an individual subject may 
be unblin ded in the event of an emergency , or if the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan for that subject depends on which study medication he or she received. In 
the event of emergent medically necessary unblinding,  the blind may be broken by [CONTACT_137570].   
Unless the subject is at immediate risk, the investigator must make diligent attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_137571]’s data. If a subject’s 
data are unblinded without the prior knowledge of the Medical Monitor , the investigator 
must notify the Medical Monitor  as soon as possible and no later than the next business 
morning. All circumstances  surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented.  
The sealed randomization envelopes should be stored in a locked area with controlled access 
until required to break the blind in the event of an emergent condition in a treated subject.    
5.9. Treatment Compliance  and Safety  
Designated s tudy personnel will directly administer  study  medication  with designated 
study personnel verifying medication administration . Time of medication administration 
(T0 = time of dosing) will be recorded into the CRF.  
Study investigators will review the investigational brochure prepared for DFN -15 in 
order to be aware of the safety related events which may be anticipated with its use.  A 
fully stocked emergency crash car t, defibrillator, oxygen, and personnel trained in 
emergency resuscitation will be available at the study center at all times during the 
confinement period.  
5.10. Drug Accountability  
The investigator (or designee) will sign for the study medic ation when received  and will 
conduct an inventory of the supplies and verify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts before completing a supplies receipt .  The inventory of 
supplies at the study site may be checked at any time during the study  by [CONTACT_115981].   The study medication must be handled and stored as described and dispensed 
only to those subjects formally enrolled  in the study.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator (or designee) to ensure that the study drug has 
been correctly documented for the amount received and dispensed.  A full drug

6.3.5.  Pain Intensity : 4-Point Categorical Pain Intensity  (PI) and Numerical 
Pain Rating Scale  (NPRS )  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_137537]  (NPRS)  by [CONTACT_1177] , 
following training on how to perform the assessment, for their current tooth extraction 
pain according to an 11 -point numeric pain rating scale (0 - 10) where 0 equates to ‘no 
pain’, and 10 equates to ‘worst  pain imaginable ’.  See Append ix B.1: Pain Intensity 
Assessment . 
After surgery, when the subject is sufficiently awake to be able to follow directions, 
subjects will be assessed for postoperative inclusion criteria.   Subjects will be eligible 
for randomi zation if pain intensity  is reported as ‘moderate ’ or ‘severe ’ level on a 4 -
point categorical pain intensity (PI) rating scale (with categories of ‘none ’, ‘mild’, 
‘moderate ’, or ‘severe ’), plus an N PRS score ≥5  (scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘no pain ’ 
and 10  is the ‘worst pain imaginable ’).  The 4-point categorical rating scale for pain 
intensity will be completed only at baseline .   
Subject s will be randomized and administered the study medication within [ADDRESS_156346]-operative inclusion  criteria  (baseline score) .   The N PRS score 
completed prior to randomization  will be utilized as the baseline pain intensity score.  
T0 is t he time of first study drug administration.  
NPRS  will be performed at: baseline, then 15, 30 , and 45 minutes , then at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 , 
5, 6, 7, and 8 hours  after treatment initiation  (T0).  Pain intensity assessments will also 
be completed before taking first rescue medication dose  (within 5 minutes prior to

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 44 of 81 6.3.6.  Pain Relief (PR)  
Pain Relief (PR) will be assessed by [CONTACT_137578] a 5-point 
categorical scale,  whe re (where 0= no relief, 1= little relief, 2= some relief, 3= a lot of 
relief, 4= complete  relief) .  See Appendix B.2 : 5-Point Categorical Pain Relief 
Assessment . 
PR will be assessed at: 15, 30, and 45 minutes, then at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours 
after treatment initiation (T 0).  PR assessments will also be completed before taking first 
rescue medication dose, (within 5 minutes prior to rescue dose) and/or at time of early 
discontinuation.  
There will be a ± five (5) minute window allowed for the timing of each PR assessment 
in the first [ADDRESS_156349] T0 then a ±10 minute window for subsequent PR assessments.   
6.3.7.  Time to Perceptible Pain Relief  and Time to Meaningful Pain Relief  
Time to perceptible pain relief and time to meaningful pain relief will be measured using 
the ‘two stopwatch ’ method.  For each randomized subject, two stopwatches will be 
started immediately after administration of the first study dose (T0).  The first st opwatch 
will be given to each subject with the instructions to stop the watch when they first 
perceive pain relief to occur ( ‘time to perceptible relief ’).  Once the first watch is 
stopped, the second stopwatch will be given to the subject with the instruc tions to stop 
the watch when they are first experiencing meaningful pain relief ( ‘time to meaningful 
relief ’).  The stopwatch  times to perceptible and meaningful pain relief wil l be recorded 
in the subject’s CRF.  
6.3.8.  Patient Rating  of Treatment satisfactorines s 
Subjects will be asked to evaluate the performance of their study medication as a pain 
treatment in response to the following inquiry; “Please rate how well your pain has been 
controlled since you received study medication?  0-poor, 1 -fair, 2 -good, 3 -very good, or 
4-excellent.”   See Append ix B.3: 5-Point Patient Rating of Treatment 
Satisfactoriness . 
The assessment  will be completed  at 8 hours after treatment initiation , prior to discharge 
from the research center  (before 8-hour post -dose PK and safety  lab collection ), or at 
least [ADDRESS_156350] rescue analgesic dose , and/or early discontinuation . 
6.4. Safety Assessments Description  
6.4.1.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
During the screening visit, at the 8-hour discharge  or early discontinuation , subjects will

Resting vital  signs (VS) will include resting blood pressure, resting pulse  rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] . Resting tests must be obtained after resting (seated  or supi[INVESTIGATOR_137539] , consistently applied ) for ≥ 5 minutes.  Resting v ital signs will be 
collected at screening, Day 1 prior to surgery, at pre-dose baseline, and the n at 1, 2, 4 , 
and 8  hours after the administration of study medication, or at time of early 
discontinuation , and at the end of study visit on Day 7  (± 3 days) . Screening  resting  vital 
signs will be done in [ADDRESS_156353]’s true 
baseline heart rate and blood pressure values.   
Vital signs may be checked at additional times on an ad hoc  basis per the judgment of 
the Investigator or study staff.  VS will have a ±30-minute window.  
Actual times will be recorded for all events, and any deviation outside the specified 
health y subject ranges must be clearly documented in the subject’s study records .  The 
Investigator or the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor may exercise his/her judgment to 
terminate a subject ’s participation in the study due to clinically significant changes in 
any clinical par ameter.  
6.4.3.  Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead ECG will be completed for all subjects at screening, Day 1 prior to surgery , at 
pre-dose baseline, and at 1, 2, 4,  and 8 hours after treatment initiation  or at time of early 
discontinuation , as well as at the end of study visit on Day 7  (± 3 days) .  At the

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 49 of 81 7. ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting 
the criteria and definition of an Adverse Event ( AE), Serious AE ( SAE ), or Serious 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SSAR) as provided in this protocol.  During the study, 
when  there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for 
detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol.  
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with th e use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, 
whether or not con sidered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any 
abnormal laboratory value deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], regardless 
of causal relationship, must be reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following:  
• signi ficant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or 
indication under study  
• exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either 
an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (e.g., abnormal physical 
exam ination finding)  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study 
medication or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as 
an AE or SAE, unle ss non -serious or serious sequelae occur)  
• symptoms or behavior suggesting cognitive or psychiatric disturbance  
The following examples are not considered AE’s : 
• medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do 
not worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or 
symptoms of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more 
severe or occur with a greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AE’s , whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and 
regardless of causality or seriousness, will b e assessed and recorded in the CRF 
beginning after administration of study medication through the final follow -up 
assessment (approximately 7 ± [ADDRESS_156360] study drug administration).  AE’s 
will b e assessed and recorded after administration of study medication through the Day [ADDRESS_156361]. Reddy’s Laboratories

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 50 of 81 visit (see Sections  7.2 and 7.3). In addition, if the investigator becomes aware of the 
occurrence of a SAE  within [ADDRESS_156362] visit, the SAE should be reported as 
outlined in Section  7.7. 
7.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• It results in death or is life -threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not intended to include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, mi ght have caused death.)  
• It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is 
not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance, 
such as uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.)  
• It results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• It requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in determining whether an AE is 
serious when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent any of th e other outcomes listed.  Examples of such 
medical events that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not resul t in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE.  
Social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137541] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137542].  
7.2.1.  SAEs  That Occur Before Administration of Study Medication  
Before administration of study medication, only SAEs assessed by [CONTACT_137579] d to study participation (e.g., related to study procedures or a change in existing 
therapy) will be transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the sponsor.  
7.2.2.  SAEs  That Occur After Study Completion  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE or d eath that occurs in a subject more than

Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 51 of 81 7.3. Definition of a Sus pected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A SAR is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257].  For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence  to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug.  
7.4. Definition of a Serious Suspe cted Adverse Reaction (SSAR)  
A SSAR is any Suspected Adverse Reaction that is determined to be serious, based on 
the outcomes of a SAE described in Section  7.2; i.e. death, life -threatening, causes or 
prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes a persistent of significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
abnormality/birth defect.  
7.5. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to collect all adverse events (AEs), serious and 
non-serious, derived by [CONTACT_19702], unsolicited reports of subjects, by [CONTACT_137580] e.g., "How have you felt since I last saw you?"  
For randomized and enrolled patients, AEs will be captured from the time of signing of 
Informed Consent Form until End of Study or Early Termination. Adverse events/ 
Serious Adverse Eve nts (SAEs) should be followed to resolution, stabilization, or until 
[ADDRESS_156364]’s source record and eCRF on the 
Medical History or appropriate page.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) will be defined as an AE that begins or that worsens 
in severity after at least one dose of study drug has been administered.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g., ECG) findings that 
are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during 
the study should be reported as adverse events.  
The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinic ally 
significant. Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study 
will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically 
significant. The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of  the event on the 
PROTOCOL DFN -15-CD-[ADDRESS_156365]. Reddy’s Laboratories          
Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 52 of 81 basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not 
the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE.  
Adverse event reporting will extend from signing of informed consent unti l End of Study 
visit /Early Termination visit. All AEs, regardless of the relationship to study drug, will be 
recorded in the subject source record and eCRF.  Standard medical terminology should be 
used when describing AEs. The anatomical location of the A Es must be specified where 
applicable.  
 
7.5.1.  Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, using his or her clinical judgment.  The intensity of e ach AE and SAE 
recorded in the CRF should be assigned to one of the following categories:  
• mild:  an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, 
and does not interfere with everyday activities  
• moderate:  an event that is suffic iently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity  is a term 
used to describe the intensity of a specif ic event, and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as severe.  The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as a severe headache).  This is not the same as serious,  which is based 
on the subject’s or event’s outcome or on a ction criteria usually associated with events 
that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning (see Section  7.2). 
7.5.2.  Assessment of Causality  
The in vestigator is obligated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  The investigator 
will assess the relationship to the study medication by [CONTACT_88550] : 
• Definitely Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  
The AE is most  likely explained by [CONTACT_5349].  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if 
possible) are positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study 
drug.  Anot her etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely . 
• Probably Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  
The AE is more  likely explained by [CONTACT_137581].  
Dechallenge (if performed) is positive.  
• Possibly Related :  An AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  
The AE could have been due  to another equally likely cause.  Dechallenge is 
positive.  
• Not Related :  The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no 
temporal relatio nship to study drug OR the AE has a much more likely alternate 
PROTOCOL DFN -15-CD-[ADDRESS_156366]. Reddy’s Laboratories          
Protocol: DFN -15-CD-010 
Version  2.0 – [ADDRESS_156367] of 
another drug . 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it 
is important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event 
before transmitting the SAE report ing form and completing the AE CRF page(s).  The 
causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting  
requirements.  The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_16740] -up information and amend  the SAE reporting form and AE CRF page(s) 
accordingly.  
7.5.3.  Assessment of Outcome  
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the cond ition stabilizes, the events 
are otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will assess 
the outcome of the event by [CONTACT_137582]:  
• Recovered/ Resolved :  The event resolved or the subject recovered without 
sequela e.  An event (either serious or non -serious) occurred and had an endpoint, 
and the subject experienced no restrictions.  Examples include stent placement 
for coronary artery disease (a device implanted is not a sequela), an 
appendectomy (a scar is not a se quela), a postoperative wound infection, or an 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].  
• Recovered/ Resolved with sequelae :  The event has at least one  secondary 
outcome that may result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  
Such sequelae are us ually limited to SAEs.  Examples include hip replacement 
resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of 
surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial 
infection resulting in a renal infarct an d loss of renal function.  
• Not Recovered/ Not resolved :  At the end of the study, a non -serious event 
either has not changed in intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, 
and the outcome is unknown.  Examples include headache, low -grade fever, o r 
nausea.  
• Unknown : The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to 
follow -up, and the status of the event is unknown.  
• Fatal  
7.5.4.  Assessment of Expectedness  
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, adverse events and suspected adverse events 
should be assessed as being expected or unexpected.  An AE or SAR is considered 
unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity 
or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not requi red or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.

SAEs docume nted at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_137583].  
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follo w-up.  The investigator will ensure that 
follow -up information provided to the sponsor includes results of any additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with 
other healthcare professionals that serve to c larify the nature of the event, the cause of 
the event, or both.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE repor ting 
form and entered into the CRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_1275].  The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor 
within the time frames outlined in Section  7.7. 
7.7. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor

Version  2.0 – 02 May 2018      Page 56 of 81 Spon sor.”  Reporting of SAEs to the Regulatory Authorities will be the responsibility of 
the Sponsor. Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
reported to the  Regulatory Authorities.  The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about 
the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_137587] t hat SSARs 
that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence be reported and legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects are met.  
Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy and are  forwarded to the 
investigators as necessary.  An investigator letter is prepared for any SAR that is 
attributable to study medication, serious, and unexpected.  The purpose of the 
investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and Good Clinical Pra ctice (GCP) 
requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply 
with requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC.  It will be 
Investigator/CRO responsibility to report the SAE to all the participating Investigators

7.9. Precautions  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product must be 
discontinued immediately, the subject should imm ediately be withdrawn from the study 
and early termination study procedures must be performed. The subject must be 
followed through the pregnancy and delivery and up to [ADDRESS_156375] be reported by [CONTACT_137588] a SAE 
(within 24 hours). The Investigator should report the event to the Sponsor immediately 
and com plete the Pregnancy Report Form  (see Section  7.[ADDRESS_156376] information).  
The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy should be 
included in this info rmation. The I nvestigator is instructed to contact [CONTACT_112976] [ADDRESS_156377] for 4 weeks after delivery for follow up 
on infant sta tus. 
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the 
Pregnancy Report Form.  
The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for serious adverse events 
and should be reported as such: delivery complications,  spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, 
death of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried/stillborn fetus.

significance level unless otherwise specified. No adjustments for multiplicity will be 
performed. Additional details of the anal ysis will be provided in the SAP and/or the 
clinical study report.  The SAP will supersede the protocol in case of a discrepancy.  
8.3.2.  Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise  no imputation will be done for missing data.  However, A Es 
with missing severity assessments will be tabulated as “severe,” and A Es with missing 
relationship assessments will be tabulated as “related” for the purpose of analysis; and 
the missing data will be presented in data listing as is.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  PI [INVESTIGATOR_137543] s Before and After Analgesic Rescue Medication  
All subjects are expected to assess their postoperative pain intensity and pain relief 
according to the pain intensity  and pain relief  schedule following the administration of 
study medication ; those PI  [INVESTIGATOR_137544] P Is and

8.5. Efficacy Analysis  
8.5.1.  SPID and PID Analyses  
Time weight ed SPID6 is the primary efficacy endpoint.  The difference among the 
treatment groups for the primary endpoint, as well as the secondary endpoints of SPID2, 
SPID4 and SPID8 will be evaluated using analysis of variance . Model will be an 
ANCOVA with treatment as main effect, and baseline PI [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a covariate.  If multiple 
centers are enrolled, then center may be added as an exploratory factor and the 
interaction with treatment will be explored .  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed to examine the int eraction between the 
treatment and analysis center.  If the interaction is considered significant at 0.[ADDRESS_156387] of DFN -15 at each dose level compared to placebo will be evaluated 
using Dunnett’s test.   
PID at each time point will be summarized with descriptive statistics (sample siz e, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment group; change 
from baseline within a group will be tested with [ADDRESS_156388] of DFN -15 at each dose level compared to placebo will be evaluated

8.5.4.  Patient Rating of Treatment s atisfactoriness  
Number and percent of subjects in each satisfaction  category (0 -poor, 1 -fair, 2 -good, 3 -
very good, or 4 -excellent) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  The difference between 
the groups in global pain control will be evaluated based on proportion of subjects rated 
their pain control as good, very good, o r excellent using Fisher’s exact test.   
8.5.5.  Proportion of Subjects Requiring Rescue Medication  
The analysis will evaluate the relative risk ( DFN -15 vs. Placeb o) of requiring rescue 
medication  during the study.  Proportion s of subjects who used rescue medication  at 
least once will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]; difference s between each DFN -15 dose 
group and placebo will be assessed using the relative risk approach.  Observed 
incidence, estimated relative risk ratio and corresponding 95% CI for the rel ative risk 
will be provided.   
The n umber of times rescue medication used during the in-patient 8 hour evaluation 
phase  will also be tabulated by  [CONTACT_1570] . Incidence of rescue medication use will 
be summarized and analyzed with a generalized linear model using a logit link.

• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators 
are properly informed of significant new information regarding AEs or risks 
associated with DFN -15. 
9.1.3.  Informed Consent  
The investigator will be provided with  a sample informed consent form for this study.  
Investigators are encouraged to use the sample form; however, they may adapt the 
information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the 
required elements of informed consent specified in  21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final 
informed consent form must be accepted by [CONTACT_137598].  Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final 
informed consent form before and after it is approved by [CONTACT_32629] B or IEC.  If any new 
information becomes available that might affect subjects’ willingness to participate in 
the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent 
form, the investigator will be provided  with a revised inf ormed consent form.  The IRB 
or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed consent form in 
advance of its use.  
Investigators must provide subjects with all the information necessary to make an 
informed decision about their participa tion in the study, including the nature and 
intended purpose of the study, possible benefits, and possible risks.  
All information in the informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether 
written or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical  and that is understandable to the 
subjects.  
Before written informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to 
the satisfaction of the subject ( or his or her legally authorized representative).  
Before a subject undergoes procedures specific to the protocol, the informed consent 
form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423] (or his or her legally authorized

c) Vitals include systolic and diastolic (seated) blood pressure, pulse rate and respir atory rate , seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] . To be completed prior to early withdrawal , prior to pain assessments, when applicable.  
d) Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed according to the schedule in Appendix C. Any of the above laboratory parame ters (or any a dditional laboratory parameter not part of the clinical lab 
evaluation) may be assessed unscheduled based on the discretion of the investigator during the study, and may be assessed dur ing the study after consultation with the study Medical Monitor, unless  
needed in emergency to ensure the safety of the subject; in such a case, Medical Monitor should be notified as soon as possib le. 
e) Day 7, End of study follow -up safety lab draws are to be performed only if there is a clinically significant abnormality or on going AE (s). 
f) Urine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of child -bearing potential at Screening, Prior to Surgery and Randomization and at End of Study.  
g) Urine screen for common drugs of abuse and alcohol breathalyzer test will be perfor med for all subjects at screening, and prior to admission for surgery  (Check -in).   
h) For timepoints where ECG coincides with vital signs collection, ECG must be conducted first  or concurrently  with vital signs . Should pain assessments and PK / safety lab  samples also coincide, 
ECG and vitals must precede applicable pain assessments, then PK and safety lab draws are to follow pain assessments ; see item (l).  To be completed prior to early withdrawal, when applicable.  
i) Pre-dose assessments only; determines ra ndomization if “moderate” to “severe” baseline pain outcome (PI) and NPRS score ≥5.  
j) In addition to the stated assessment schedule, pain intensity will be assessed by [CONTACT_137609] 11 -point NPRS immediately within ±5 minutes of provision of rescue medication.  Assessment will 
also be completed prior to early withdrawal.  
k) In addition to the stated pain relief assessment schedule, pain relief will be assessed by [CONTACT_137610] a 5 -point categorical  pain relief (PR)  scale immediately before provision of rescue medication. 
Assessment will also be completed prior to early withdrawal.  
l) Patient Rating of Treatment satisfactoriness’ assessment  will be completed at [ADDRESS_156414] pro vision of rescue medication, whichever is earlier.  Assessment will 
also be completed prior to early withdrawal.  
m) Whenever the time of a PK blood sample collection coincides with efficacy assessments, the PK sample will be drawn after the efficacy assessment s are taken. Any PK sample within the first hour

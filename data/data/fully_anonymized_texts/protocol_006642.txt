The purpose of this study is to 
characterize visual system function in individuals with high trait anxiety. 
The fMRI portion of this study has already been conducted elsewhere. The follow up portion of the study 
is designed to determine if fMRI data can be used to predict 
future 
quality of life and anxiety symptoms 
that will be assessed at follow up. We hypothesize that visual cortex functional coupling will explain more 
variance in 
quality of life and anxiety severity at six months post
-
scan than prefrontal
-
amygdala 
functional coupling. 
 
A subset of individuals
 
with high trait anxiety will also complete a
n
 
emotional faces task 
(MicroExpressions Training Task, or METT) as well as a [ADDRESS_520163]

Individuals with high trait anxiety (HTA) have elevated fear responses to threatening situations and are 
more likely to react with nervousness or apprehension to a broad range of situations that may not be 
threatening. HTA is a stable individually differin
g feature and trans
-
diagnostic risk factor for the 
development of a range of chronic illnesses and conditions, most prominently mood and anxiety 
disorders. HTA is also associated with poor functional outcomes in psychiatric disorders, such as 
reduced quali
ty of life (QoL). However, the neurobiological underpi[INVESTIGATOR_412622]. 
Identification of modifiable mechanisms that underlie HTA is critical given that HTA is a behavioral 
marker that often precedes the onset of psychiatric disorders and is as
sociated with significant illness 
burden and suffering.
 
 
HTA is characterized by [CONTACT_412627]. Because of the primacy of 
social visual information for humans, the anxiety literature emphasizes social stimuli such as novel faces 
(potential threat) and emotional faces. Indiv
iduals with anxiety disorders misattribute threat to neutral 
stimuli, overestimate threat, and identify faces as threatening at lower emotional expression intensities 
relative to individuals without HTA.
 
 
In the traditional, top
-
down anxiety model, this bias is believed to be due to incorrect stimulus 
contextualization, mediated by [CONTACT_412628] (PFC) projections to the amygdala. However, the role of 
both bottom
-
up and top
-
down processes in visual perce
ption has long been recognized. Taken together, 
there is ample evidence for a reduced perceptual threshold in HTA that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_412629]
-
down model. Rather, such findings suggest that misattribution of threat or “diminished 
threat sel
ectivity” in HTA includes a bottom
-
up sensory mechanism.
 
 
 
Enhanced visual cortex activation in response to novel or emotional stimuli is not solely dependent on 
top
-
down processes. Enhanced amplitude of the earliest visual waveform components in response to 
novel or emotional stimuli is well
-
established. The dual
 
processing model posits that both bottom
-
up, 
implicit visual perception, and top
-
down, effortful attention, contribute to stimulus perception. In top
-
down processing, stimuli are attended because of effortful control that is often goal
-
directed. This pro
cess 
is facilitated by [CONTACT_412630]. In contrast, bottom
-
up implicit 
perceptual processes, facilitated by [CONTACT_412631], are preattentive. 
 
 
Perceptual alterations in HTA occur in a variety of contexts, indicating a generalized early processing 
mechanism. Although the literature has focused almost exclusively on fearful and angry face perception, 
perceptual processing of positive stimuli is als
o heightened in HTA and correlates with visual cortex 
function. The neural correlates of viewing more subtle emotional expressions in HTA, however, have not 
been investigated. Social interactions in the real world require interpretation of subtle emotiona
l cues. 
Studies of subtle expressions created via emotional expression morphs are more naturalistic and would 
probe for a neural mechanism for reduced threat attribution threshold in HTA. By [CONTACT_412632], we will test our 
hypothesis that HTA is characterized by [CONTACT_412633]
-
up functional 
coupling to the amygdala, and that this functional alteration persists in a variety of cont
exts. If 
individuals with HTA show enhanced responsiveness to nonsocial stimuli, this would indicate generalized 
alterations in visual processes. Implicit, preattentive visual processing is designed to detect potential 
threats or rewards and occurs at an e
arlier latency than top
-
down processing, which provides context for

09/01/[ADDRESS_520165] range of 
stimulus types. Observation of a generally elevated response would support the hypothesis that 
heightened reactivity in HTA is preattentive, implicit, and
 
facilitated by [CONTACT_412634]
-
up mechanism. 
Because the extant fMRI literature has focused nearly exclusively on threatening social stimuli, we are 
currently limited in our ability to answer questions about the function of the visual system in HTA and it
s 
relationship to processing in general as opposed to threat processing specifically.

C
RITERIA
*
 
This portion of the study will be conducted on participants who have already been recruited, screened, 
and enrolled in the study at another site. The exclusion 
criteria for recruitment were: 
 
 
1) estimated IQ<70, 2) contraindication to MRI
 
(including 
metal implants or devices in the body, 
pregnancy, claustrophobia)
, 3) history of head trauma or loss of consciousness, 4) major medical or 
neurological illness 5) current psychiatric medication usage or use in the last three months, 6) 
alcohol/substance abuse or dependence and/or illicit substance use (excepting cannabi
s) in the last three 
months, determined by [CONTACT_88188]
-
IV (SCID), 7) history of mania or 
psychosis
 
 
This study does not include individuals who are not yet adults, as it was designed to assess visual system 
function in adults. Pregnancy was an exclusion criteria at the time of study enrollment because of MRI 
contraindications. No prisoners
 
or adults lack capacity to consent are included in this study
. No one who 
is a non
-
English speaker will be included, as all study instruments and instructions are in English and 
have not necessarily been validated in other languages. 
 
 
Because this is the follow up portion of this study, it is possible that some participants may have become 
pregnant in the intervening months since they completed their fMRI scan. Because this is a 
phone and 
teleconference based follow up study that involves answering self
-
report questionnaires, there are no 
risks specifically associated with pregnancy. 
We will not be collecting information related to pregnancy 
status for the remainder of the study. 
Similarly, 
it is possible that participants may have begun taking 
psychiatric medication in the intervening months since they were first enrolled in the study. This is not an 
exclusion criterion for the follow up portion of this study, as this study was designed to b
e a naturalistic 
study of high trait anxiety. Therefore, 
participants were not instructed to change their behavior regarding 
treatment/seeking treatment while enrolled in this study.

To
 
assess the relative contributions of fMRI data to anxiety severity and QoL longitudinally, participants 
will repeat QoL and anxiety measures via online forms approximately six months post
-
scan visit. 
These 
self
-
report forms assess various facets of anxiety symptoms and quality of life. 
These measures include 
the 
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (
DASS
)
,
 
Mood Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire
 
(
MASQ
)
, 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
,

,

, and an update to 
their medication form
 
in case there have been any changes to their medication usage
.
 
 
 
As an Exploratory Aim designed to test the hypothesized mechanism for altered visual processing in HTA 
and its relation to future clinical and functional measures, 
individuals with HTA
 
will be randomly 
assigned to complete a visual discrimination behavioral manipulation 
at either [ADDRESS_520166] scan.
 
The behavioral manipulation is the Micro Expressions Training Tool (METT), a visual 
discrimination task that will be used to determine if the visual system is a tractable target for 
intervention.
 
The METT presents 
images
 
of micro expressions; participants receive real
-
time feedback 
following forced choice emotional identification. The METT includes a brief pre
-
test, tra
ining, and then a 
post
-
test. 
It takes approximately [ADDRESS_520167] performance data, to include 
accuracy and rate of training. 
Emotional micro expressions are subtle, involuntary expressions that 
communicate emotion. Facial micro expression identification is trainable and associated with social 
behavior and psychological well
-
being. We will repeat collections of self
-
report data i
n the HTA 
participants approximately 12 months from the initial fMRI visit via online survey. This will 
allow us to 
assess possible intervention effects on anxiety symptom severity and QoL 12 months later.

The most likely and common risk associated with study procedures is boredom. Participants may become 
bored while completing self

report forms or the METT. 
There is also an infrequent risk of breach of 
confidentiality
. To minimize risk, participants will be reminded that they are free to terminate their 
participation at any time. 
Risk of breach of confidentiality will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_412637].
 
Furthermore, identifiable data will be kept in separate,

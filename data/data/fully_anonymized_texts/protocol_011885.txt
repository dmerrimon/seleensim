Trial site(s) Multi-center trial conducted globally
Clinical phase II
Trial rationale The prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing worldwide. Currently, the cornerstone treatment is lifestyle modifications focusing on diet and exercise resulting in weight loss, however, weight loss is difficult to achieve and maintain. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are highly demanded. This trial will serve as a proof of clinical concept, as it will investigate potential improvement in liver histology in patients with NASH and fibrosis following treatment with BI 456906. Furthermore, it will help to determine the most suitable dose that will be used in 
phase III trial(s). Liver biopsy and imaging will be used to confirm 
the diagnosis of NASH at baseline and to assess the treatment response. The 48-week treatment duration is expected to be sufficient to show improvement in NASH with no worsening of fibrosis.
Trial objective(s) The main trial objectives are to demonstrate a non-flat dose response curve, to evaluate the size of the treatment effect (using the absolute difference in proportions of patients with histological improvement between BI 456906 and placebo at Week 48), and to characterize the dose-response relationship.
Trial endpoints The primary endpoint is the improvement (yes/ no) from baseline in liver histological findings based on liver biopsy after 48 weeks of treatment in patients with NASH (NAS ≥4, fibrosis F1-F3).
Improvement in histological findings is defined as a composite of: 
Improvement in NASH:Decrease of at least two points in NAS, with at least one point

Main in- and exclusion 
criteriaInclusion criteria:
∀Male or female patients ≥ 18 years (or who are of legal age in 
countries where that is greater than 18 years) and ≤ 80 years of 
age at time of consent.
∀Diagnosis of NASH (NAS ≥ 4, with at least 1 point in

1. Visit 1a is not required if a historical biopsy with sufficient and analysable material was collected within the last 6 months  prior to 
randomisation (refer to Section 3.3.1 and 5.1.1 ).
2. Day of randomisation and the first administration of trial medication.
3. In case of early discontinuation (ED), Visit [ADDRESS_371311] 40 weeks. MR imaging does not need to be performed at the ED visit if the patient discontinues before Visi t 22 or if 
another MR imaging was performed within 12 weeks before the ED.  
 Follow-up Visit 33 should be performed 4 weeks/28 days after the ED visit.
4. Number of weeks since randomization.
5. Trial visits will be conducted in two ways: 1/ at site (indicated by “S” in the Flow Chart ) and 2/ remotely via telemedicine from patient’s 
home (indicated by “T” in the Flow Chart). Method of visit conduct (on-site or remote) can be modified. Modifications from an on -site to a 
remote visit require Sponsor approval.
6. Visit 1 can be conducted within less than 10 weeks of randomization. Before randomization, the Investigator should ensure that al l safety 
laboratory results, ECG reading, imaging and liver biopsy results are available to ensure that the patient meets all inclusion criteria and does 
not meet any exclusion criteria. In the event of logistical issues with the reporting of results by [CONTACT_112726](s) a pati ent who meets all 
inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria should be considered for participation in the clinical trial even if  he/ she exceeds
the screening period of [ADDRESS_371312] be obtained prior to starting any trial procedure. Fasting is conside red part of a 
trial procedure. For the historical biopsy, if applicable, a written non-trial specific informed consent has been obtained (per loc al standard). 
8. Physical examination after screening is required only if patient reports symptoms.

optional but recommended.
10. Body mass index will be calculated automatically. For weight measurement, follow guidelines in Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_371315] and hip circumference measurement, follow guidelines in Section 5.1.5 .
12. Safety laboratory tests include haematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_303648]. For details refer to Table 5.2.3:[ADDRESS_371316] on SARS-CoV-2 will be performed at Visit 1.15. ECG should be recorded in triplicate at Visit 1. ECG should be recorded before blood samples are taken. ECG recording may be repeated by 
[CONTACT_303670]. For ECG measurement, follow guidelines in Section 5.2.4 .
16. After the individual patient’s end of the trial the Investigator should report only any cancers of new histology and exacerba tions of existing 
cancer, trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the Investigator may become aware of and only via  the SAE 
form.
17. For female patients of childbearing potential only. Xs = serum testing, Xu = urine testing. Serum pregnancy testing will be pe rformed at Visit 
[ADDRESS_371317] be completed prior to trial medication intake. Refer to 
Section 6.1 .
18. At Visit 16, 20 and 24 the IRT call will only be made if a patient visits the site due to tolerability issues and requires a n ew assignment of 
trial medication.

include trial medication to be administered at the site for Visit 14 and trial medication needed for the patient for use at home  at Visit 15, 16 
and 17. However, if a patient experiences tolerability issues with the dose administered at Visit 14 and 15, new trial medicatio n kits will be 
dispensed to him/ her at Visit 16.
20. Patient and/ or designated person should be trained on how to administer the trial medication. If the patient is not willing to self-administer 
the injections, he/ she should be given the option to visit the site and/or to have the medication administered by a qualified si te personnel or 
designated person. During site visits the trial medication should be preferably administered by a qualified site personnel. 
21. Medication compliance should be monitored throughout the treatment period to ensure the required compliance criteria are met  (refer to 
Section 4.3 ).
22. Patients will be using a smartphone for trial-related application (Science 37 platform which may include patient diary,  
patient-facing materials). Training will be provided to patients on how to use the application.
23. C-SSRS, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale questionnaires will be administered at Visit 1 using the “baseline/screening” version. The 
“since last visit” version will be used at the following visits. Paper forms will be used for the assessment of C-SSRS (refer to Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ).
25. T2DM patients taking antidiabetic medication will be provided with a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) device for use at h ome during 
the treatment period.  Patients may also use their own device for self-monitoring of blood glucose.

BI 456906 is being developed in two indications, namely NASH and obesity. The target indications read as follows:
1) Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in NASH patients (NAFLD activity score 
(NAS) ≥4, with at least one point in ballooning and inflammation each) with 
advanced liver fibrosis (fibrosis stages 2 and 3). A relevant subpopulation has to be 
defined.
2) Weight management in patients with obesity or overweight with co-morbidities, plus 
cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with increased cardiovascular risk.
These diseases are highly prevalent and are increasing at an alarming rate. Non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome, is the most common chronic liver disease. Currently, no approved pharmacotherapy for NASH, the progressive form of NAFLD, is available, relying on treatment of the comorbidities of the metabolic syndrome. Obesity is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including all components of the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, joint and psychosocial disorders. Currently, the available weight loss medications lack sufficient efficacy, safety, tolerability, a nd convenience to reduce body weight and 
improve its associated co-morbidities/ conditions.
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
It is estimated that about 1/3 of the population (in US, EU5, Japan and urban China) have 
NAFLD, and about 17 Mio. (2-5%) have NASH with advanced fibrosis (F2 and F3). It is also estimated that this number will double (approx. 36 Mio) within the next 15 years [ R20-1255 ].
Approximately 1-2% of patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis (F2 and F3) are at risk to 
develop cirrhosis, with its complications including decompensation, need for transplantation, HCC and liver–related death.
In addition to these late complications, patients with NASH have little to no liver-related 
symptoms, however, more and more data suggest that the quality of life in patients with NASH is reduced. These new data have led to a shift in the paradigm from characterizing patients with NASH as asymptomatic to exhibiting non-specific symptoms. Most common symptoms are fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and pain.

BI 456906 leads to full activation of the GLP-1R at the predicted therapeutic exposure, but 
only to a partial activation of the GCGR, which seems sufficient to achieve more efficacycompared to GLP-1R activation alone. Simultaneous dual activation of GLP-1R and GCGR by [CONTACT_35978] 456906 is anticipated to improve glycemic control, body weight loss as well as NASHand fibrosis.  
Key pharmacokinetic characteristics
Pharmacokinetics of BI 456906 were investigated after single subcutaneous doses of 0.3, 0.5 
and 1.2 mg. T maxwas reached between 9 and 60 hours. C maxwas 7, 13 and 34 nM, 
respectively. T 1/2 ranged from 10 to 15h. Dose proportionality was demonstrated for C max, 
AUC0-168, and AUC0- ∞. Further details, also on multiple dosing, can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
Drug interactions
GLP-1R agonism reduces gastric emptying. This was assessed by [CONTACT_303674] 
456906 on the absorption of paracetamol. Paracetamol C max, AUC0-10, and AUC0- ∞were 
slightly lower after a single dose of 0.[ADDRESS_371335] Period (REP) of BI [ADDRESS_371336] 
dose with measurable drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects still likely to be present.
Data from non-clinical studies
Liver steatosis improvement was more pronounced by [CONTACT_35978] 456906 than with liraglutide. In a 
4-week study in Diet Induced Obesity (DIO) mice, BI 456906 at a subcutaneous dose of 10 nmol/kg q.d. (C
min109 nM) reduced liver triglycerides by 31% (from 203 mg/g in vehicle-
treated animals to 140 mg/g) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in plasma by 62% (from 403 U/l in vehicle-treated animals to 154 U/l). These effects were superior to those of liraglutide (176 mg/g; 215 U/l) at supra-therapeutic exposure (10 nmol/kg bid; C
min39 nM). 
Overall, the effects on plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_303650] 456906 at predicted therapeutic exposure were comparable to liraglutide at supra-therapeutic exposure ( n00254747-01 ). In C57Bl/6J mice 
on Amylin Liver NASH diet ([AMLN], a high fat, high fructose, high cholesterol diet) as a 
DIO NASH model, BI 456906 at 20, 30 and 40 nmol/kg q.d. was compared with liraglutide at 100 nmol/kg q.d. and dulaglutide at 2 nmol/kg q2d. After [ADDRESS_371337] diet was reduced by 10% and 13% with dulaglutide and liraglutide, and dose-dependently by 15-21% with BI 456906. C
minexposure was 160 
nM, 234 nM, 321 nM and 322 nM, respectively, for low, medium and high dose BI 456906 and liraglutide. ALT and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) in plasma were significantlyreduced by [CONTACT_303675]. Liver triglycerides were dose-dependently reduced by 51-66% with BI 456906 compared to liraglutide (-33%) and dulaglutide (-10%, not significant). Thus, the effect of BI 456906 on body weight and liver triglyceride content was superior to liraglutide/dulaglutide. Histological analysis of the liver for the lowest dose of BI 456906 showed an improvement of the steatosis score in  all animals vs. the pre-treatment value (6/13 
animals improved by [CONTACT_303676], 7/13 animals improved by [CONTACT_303677]). The effects for the medium and high dose of BI 456906 were comparable to the low dose but with a higher share

Data from clinical studies
GLP-1R agonists are known to be associated with gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiac side 
effects. Multiple studies and clinical experience from GLP-1R agonists suggest that GI side 
effects including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, appear to be dose dependent. Moreover, dose 
escalation has been shown to significantly improve tolerability in clinical practice for a number of these compounds. For example, the proportion of patients reporting nausea was 20% lower for semaglutide with dose escalation than without dose escalation [ R17-4311 ].
Cardiac conduction disorders were described for GLP-1R agonists in clinical trials and in the 
prescribing information for Saxenda [ R19-1407 ], reported as first-degree atrioventricular
block, right bundle branch block, or left bundle branch block as well as QT-prolongation.
BI 456906 has been studied in healthy volunteers in a single rising dose trial ( c15175923-02 ). 
Similar to other GLP-1R agonists, nausea and vomiting were seen with increasing doses up to 
1.2 mg and the trial was discontinued early due to severe nausea and vomiting in a number of healthy volunteers. Currently, BI 456906 is being studied in a multiple rising dose trial(c21168858-05 ) with dose escalation to investigate the safety and tolerability of different 
dose escalation schemes in otherwise healthy patients with obesity/overweight to determine 
a dose escalation scheme that minimizes gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs).
Preliminary data out of the multiple rising dose (MRD) trial (c21168858-05) trial where BI 
456906 was administered for 6 weeks in 4 different titration schemas (one once-daily dose group and three once-weekly dose groups, all with weekly dose escalation) showed thefrequent AEs were gastrointestinal disorders.  Specifically, symptoms included nausea in up to 70% of patients on BI 456906 vs 23% on placebo, dyspepsia in up to 39% vs. 8% in placebo, and abdominal distention in up to 37% vs. 8% in placebo, all of mild to moderate intensity. Among other frequently reported AEs in the metabolism and nutrition disorders class were decreased appetite in up to 67% vs 39% in placebo, and early satiety in up to 46% 
vs 15% on placebo. Mild fatigue was reported in 8% of patients on BI 456906 and 15% of patients on placebo while moderate fatigue was reported only on BI 456906 in only 6% of patients. Cardiac disorders were only reported in the BI 456906 treated group with 9% AV block first degree, 9% AV block second degree, 8% sinus tachycardia and 6% ventricular extrasystoles ( c28750666 ).
Most of the reported AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe AEs diarrhea (2) and 
vomiting (1) were reported for 3 out of 67 patients treated with BI 456906. No deaths, serious

glycemic control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), chronic weight management in patients with obesity/overweight and treatment of patients with NASH and fibrosis.
This trial is a 48-week phase II trial to examine three dose levels of BI [ADDRESS_371343] in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_303651]/IV trial, in which the histological improvement as well as long-term outcomes will be evaluated. It also functions as confirmatory trial to the planned pi[INVESTIGATOR_303652].
Multiple clinical trials indicate that GLP-[ADDRESS_371344] benefit in their weight management, metabolic status as well as NASH. GLP-1R agonism achieves glucose lowering by [CONTACT_303679]-dependent insulin-secretion at the pancreatic β-cell. In addition, GLP-1R activation lowers
body weight by [CONTACT_303680]. In addition, GCGR agonism reduces body weight by [CONTACT_303681], and subsequently reducing lipotoxicity. In patientswith NASH and fibrosis, dual agonism at the GLP-1R and GCGR is expected to result in improvements in glycemic control, reduction of body weight and improvement of NASH and fibrosis, thereby [CONTACT_303682], but also the underlying metabolic syndrome.
Patients with NASH and any pre-cirrhotic stage of fibrosis (F1 to F3) will be included in this 
trial. The targeted patient population for the compound however is patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis. This patient population will be investigated in phase III, especially in regards of long-term outcome events as histological progression to cirrhosis, liver transplantation, all-cause mortality. However, as no significant number of events are anticipated in this trial due to the treatment duration of 48 weeks and the sample size of about 240, the primary outcome of this trial is improvement of NASH, which is anticipated to be

these patients will be assessed and monitored extensively, which has been shown in addition to SOC to already have a substantial effect on NASH and fibrosis in clinical trials.
Patients receiving 2.4 mg/ week as maintenance dose are anticipated to have benefit on their 
metabolic status, as this dose is most likely equivalent to the doses of the available GLP-1Ragonists for T2DM, as well as on their weight. The effect on NASH however is anticipated to be not statistically significant compared to placebo.

NASH diagnosis and assessment of treatment response is based on liver biopsies. Liver 
biopsy is an invasive procedure and represents certain risks for patients such as bleeding, painor organ perforation. To minimize those risks sites will be expected to follow local standard processes considering the suitability of a patient for the procedure, and whilst conducting the procedure. In this trial the initial biopsy will be  performed only after all other eligibility 
parameters have been confrmed for a patient. Furthermore, use of historical biopsy will be permitted, if sufficient and analysable material is available from that biopsy and if it was performed within 6 months of randomization. 
Patients will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. While exposure to a 
high magnet field does not pose additional risks to patients, contraindications to MRI exist; 
patients with these contraindications will be excluded from the trial (refer to Section 3.3.3 ).

as diarrhea or obstipation. Also, pancreatitis (acute and acute-on-chronic) is known to 
occur under treatment with GLP-1R agonists.
∀Metabolism and nutrition disorders, as low blood glucose in patients with diabetes,

2.1 MAIN OBJECTIVES, PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
2.1.1 Main objectives
This trial will characterize the dose response curve for BI 456906 in patients with NASH 
(NAS ≥4, fibrosis F1-F3) by [CONTACT_303686]. The response is the 
proportion of patients with improvement from baseline in liver histological findings after 48 weeks (as defined in Section 2.1.2).
The main trial objectives are to demonstrate a non-flat dose response curve, to evaluate the 
size of the treatment effect (using the absolute difference in proportions of patients with histological improvement between BI 456906 and placebo at Week 48), and to characterize the dose-response relationship. 
2.1.2 Primary endpoint(s)
The primary endpoint is the improvement (yes/ no) from baseline in liver histological 
findings based on liver biopsy after 48 weeks of treatment in patients with NASH (NAS ≥4, 
fibrosis F1-F3). NAFLD activity score (NAS) represents the sum of scores for steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-3) and ballooning (0-2), refer to Table 5.1.1: 1 for NAS and fibrosis 
stage.
Improvement in histological findings is defined as a composite of: 
Improvement in NASH:
Decrease of at least [ADDRESS_371355] 1 point decrease in NAS sub-score of either lobular inflammation or ballooning 
ANDNo worsening of fibrosis, defined as absence of any increase in the fibrosis stage.
A patient who has improvement in histological findings after 48 weeks of treatment will be 
defined as a responder. A patient with the intercurrent event of early discontinuation of the 
treatment for any reason will be defined as a non-responder unless biopsy results are 
available, in which case they will be used to determine responder status.
2.1.3 Secondary endpoint(s)
Secondary efficacy endpoints include:
∀Improvement of liver fat content (yes/ no) defined as at least 30% relative reduction in 
liver fat content after 48 weeks of treatment compared to baseline assessed by [CONTACT_303687] (MRI-PDFF)
∀Absolute and relative change of liver fat content from baseline after 48 weeks of 
treatment assessed by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF

The end of the trial is defined as “last patient out”, i.e., the last Follow-up visit (Visit 33) 
completed by [CONTACT_23277].
The trial will apply a hybrid trial management approach that will employ telemedicine 
technology for interactions between the Investigator/ trial personnel and patients. The method of telemedicine allows for practice of medicine using technology to deliver care remotely at a distance. For further details refer to Section 6.1 .
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled design was chosen for this trial as an 
accepted standard trial design for a phase II trial.
The treatment duration of [ADDRESS_371359] treatment for NASH and/or fibrosis is availableand in accordance with the guidelines provided by [CONTACT_12721].
The hybrid trial management approach was chosen in order to make the trial participation 
more convenient for patients by [CONTACT_303689]. Furthermore, as some trial procedures will be performed at patient’s home, the site burden will also be reduced. Approximately 60% of the visits is expected to occur at the site. The remaining visits should be conducted remotely at patient’s home, the patient will interact with the Investigator and/or site personnel via a video conferencing feature. For the method of visit conduct (on-site or remote) please refer to the Flow Chart . Modifications from on-site to 
remote visits require Sponsor approval.
Data Monitoring Committee
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), independent from the Sponsor, will be established to 
review the safety unblinded data at regular intervals, and to recommend to the Sponsor whether to continue, modify, or stop the tr ial. An unplanned DMC meeting may be called if 
there is an emergency concern on the safety of the patients ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The tasks and 
responsibilities of the DMC members will be detailed in the DMC charter. Please refer to 
Section 8.7 .
Clinical Event Committee
The trial will be set-up with prospective adjudication of all cardiovascular, pancreatic, thyroid 
and oncological trigger events as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].5 . The prospectively defined 
adjudication process will assess cardiovascular, pancreatic, thyroid and oncological events 
through an independent, blinded, external Clinical Event Committee (CEC). Details on the composition of the committee, its procedures and interactions will be provided in a separate CEC charter. Adjudication was implemented in the trial in accordance with the FDA draft

3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
240 patients with biopsy proven NASH and fibrosis will be randomised to one of the four
treatment groups in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_371361] be obtained from the Sponsor. This will only be allowed after a careful review of the enrolment status.
Recruitment of patients for this trial will be competitive, i.e., screening for the trial will stop 
at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patients has been randomised. 
Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial.
Re-testing during the screening period and re-screening, if a patient is not eligible initially, is 
each allowed once.
If a patient is randomised in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria on the day of enrolment), the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_15608].
Patients who discontinue following randomization will not be replaced and may not be re-
enrolled at a later date.
To ensure sufficient enrolment of patients with advanced fibrosis, recruitment of patients 
with fibrosis stage F1 will be capped at 30% of randomized patients.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e., who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF irrespective of whether or not they have been treated with trial medication.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
The trial will include patients with NASH with NAS ≥ 4 (with at least 1 point in ballooning 
and inflammation each) and fibrosis stage F1-F3, as confirmed by [CONTACT_303690] a historical biopsy conducted within the last 6 months prior to randomization.
Please refer to Section 8.3.1 (Source Documents) for the documentation requirements 
pertaining to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

menopausal unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559].Please note that tubal ligation is NOT accepted as a method of permanent sterilisation and therefore a woman who 
underwent tubal ligation is still considered as WOCBP. However tubal ligation is considered as a method of highly effective 
birth control.

For this trial, target maintenance doses of 2.4 mg, 4.8 mg and 6.0 mg once weekly dosing 
were selected based on the following considerations:
Safety and tolerability of BI 456906 is being evaluated in healthy volunteers with obesity or 
overweight up to 6 weeks for doses ranging from 0.7 to 3.15 mg/ week (daily administration)
Boehringer Ingelheim 27 Jul 2023

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_371377]-03 (18.0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019and 0.3 to 3.0 mg/ week (weekly administration) and up to 16 weeks for doses ranging from 0.6 to 4.8 mg/ week (once or twice weekly administration) in trial 1404-0003 ( c21168858-
05). The first part of the trial with the treatment duration up to 6 weeks has already been 
completed. The available clinical data indicate that the estimated human dose for 
maintenance in obesity might be reached with 4.8 mg/ week to achieve the anticipated exposure.
The safety margin for the 4.8 mg/ week dose has an exposure multiple of 5.3 fold (C
max,ss) 
and 4.1 fold (AUC τ,ss) to the no-observed-adverse-effect level in mice and cynomolgus 
monkeys.
However, pre-clinical models showed that higher exposures than in obesity might be needed 
in NASH to show meaningful efficacy ( n00254747-01 and n00267699-01 ). This is 
potentially based on the effect of the GCGR agonism which is assumed to increase directly 
the lipid and fatty acid oxidation in the live r. The effect of the GCGR agonism is anticipated 
to be more pronounced at higher doses. Since this trial is intended to be a dose-finding trial, 6.0 mg/ week dose was selected.
The safety margin for the 6.0 mg/ week dose has an exposure multiple of 3.1 fold (C
max,ss) 
and 3.1 fold (AUC τ,ss) to the no-observed-adverse-effect level of the 26-week toxicological 
study in mice. Safety margins to the no- observed-adverse-effect level of the 39-week 
toxicological study of 2.4 and 0.8 based on C maxand 2.6 and 0.7 based on AUC were derived 
for male and female cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. These calculations are based on a population PK model, set up with PK data from trial 1404-0001 ( c22991258-01 ) and 1404-
0003 (c21168858-05). It should be noted that the expected C maxand AUC refer to the 
enrolment criteria (70 kg and BMI 25 kg/m2) and is hence a worst-case scenario. A heavier 
individual will have lower C maxand AUC.
The NOAEL for BI [ADDRESS_371378] dose of 2.4 mg/ week in this tr ial is predicted to achieve sub-therapeutic PD 
response comparable to placebo in patients with NASH and fibrosis, however, still providing weight loss and improvement in the metabolic status.
The results from the 1404-[ADDRESS_371379] common GI adverse events such as 
nausea and vomiting occur at the beginning of the drug exposure and can be mitigated by a careful dose escalation. The tolerability of GLP-1 receptor agonists is known to improve over time, so is assumed that even higher doses of BI 456906 will be tolerated [ R20-0479 ]. In 
addition, close monitoring is implemented in this trial to assure patients´ safety.
Overall, the three selected maintenance doses are anticipated to support robust dose-
exposure-response analyses for multiple safety a nd efficacy measures to serve as a basis for 
selection of the suitable dose regimen for the phase III trial.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_371380]-03 (18.0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Selected doses cover a safe starting dose of 0.3 mg/ week with different dose escalation schemes up to the target maintenance dose. The first 10 weeks of the dose escalation period will be identical for all three active treatment groups. The duration of the dose escalation up to the target maintenance dose differs among the active treatment groups from 14 to 22weeks.
Dose adjustment will be allowed in all groups during the dose escalation period after Visit 14
as well as any time during the maintenance period based on the occurrence of AEs. If a patient does not tolerate a dose due to AEs in the previous two weeks and wishes to reduce the dose, then the dose should be decreased to the next lower tolerated target maintenance dose. The assignment of the lower dose will occur in a blinded fashion via IRT. Examples:
∀If a patient who does not tolerate a dose of 2.4 mg over two weeks during the dose 
escalation period and wishes to reduce the dose will be changed to placebo;
∀If a patient who does not tolerate a dose of 3.6 mg over two weeks during the dose 
escalation period and wishes to reduce the dose will be changed to 2.4 mg;
∀If a patient who does not tolerate a dose of 4.[ADDRESS_371381] two weeks before a remote visit (i.e., Visit 16, 20 or 24) and believes that a dose adjustment is needed, the patient will be asked to come to the site and to return the unused trial medicationdispensed to him/ her during the previous site vis it. The Investigator will assess together with 
the patient, if a dose adjustment is needed, and a new trial medication will be dispensed to the patient for the next two administrations.
If a patient experiences tolerance issues with a dose due to AEs over two weeks within the 
treatment period before Visit 14, the trial medication should be discontinued, and the patient should undergo the procedures of the EOT and Follow-up visit (Visit 32 and 33 resp.).
Maintenance period
If required, a dose adjustment during the maintenance period should occur at the site either 
during a planned or an unscheduled visit.
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
After the assessment of all in- a nd exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be randomised 
to treatment groups according to a randomisation plan in a 1:1:1:1 ratio at Visit 2 viaInteractive Response Technology (IRT). Details on randomization are provided in Section 
7.4. Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined by a computer-generated 
random sequence. Access to the randomization code will be controlled and documented. For 
further details please refer to Section 4.1.5 .

administered two injections at every dosing day. Trial medication will be administered preferably by a qualified site personnel during site visits. During remote visits and between site visits during the maintenance period trial medication will be administered by [CONTACT_303696] a designated person. Patient and a designated person (if appointed) will be properly trained before starting the administration at home. Furthermore, during remote visits the administration of trial medication will be monitored by a qualified site personnel via the video conferencing function available on the Scien ce 37 platform.

Dose escalation period
During the dose escalation period the treatment with trial medication may be interrupted at 
maximum two occasions. On each occasion only one dose of trial medication can be missed. At the re-start the patient will continue with  the dose escalation scheme without any changes. 
Examples:
∀If a patient misses a dose at Visit 15, he/ she should re-start the treatment at Visit 16
with the planned dose of Visit 16.
∀If a patient misses Visit 14, he/ she should come to the site not later than at Visit 15 to 
re-start the treatment with the planned dose of Visit 15 and to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up the trial medication for self-administration during the next two remote visits (Visit 16 and 17).  
Maintenance period
During the maintenance period the treatment with  trial medication may also be interrupted on
maximum two occasions. Two consecutive doses of trial medication may be missed at each occasion. In the event of one missed dose the patient should re-start at the dose from before the temporary discontinuation. In the event of two missed consecutive doses, the dose at re-start will be decreased by [CONTACT_303698]-escalated to the maintenance dosein weekly steps within two weeks. 
Examples: 
∀If a patient misses two consecutive doses at Week 25 and 26, he/ she should come for 
the next dose administration at Week 27 to the site (unscheduled visit) and return the unused trial medication to the site. During the unscheduled visit a new trial medication (reduced dose) will be administered to the patient. Then patient will continue with the planned visit schedule,  i.e., Week 28 visit (Visit 27) will occur at 
the site. From Week 29 on the patient will be back at the maintenance dose.
∀If a patient misses two consecutive doses at Week 27 and 28, he/she should come for 
the next dose administration at Week 29 to the site (unscheduled visit) and return the unused trial medication to the site. During the unscheduled visit a new trial medication (reduced dose) will be administered and trial medication for the next two administrations at Week 30 and 31 will be dispensed to the patient. Then patient will continue with the planned visit schedule, i.e., Week 32 visit (Visit 28) will occur at 
the site. From Week [ADDRESS_371384] dose from the

Patients should be encouraged to be fully compliant with the trial medication dosing schedule 
(Flow Chart ). 
If a dose is missed on the planned dosing day, patients should take the planned dose within 
two days. If more time has elapsed since the missed dose, then the patients should wait to take the next planned dose. A minimum of five days between doses is required.
Patients are considered out of compliance, and should be discontinued from the trial:
1) if they miss two or more consecutive doses OR if they miss one dose at more than two 
occasions during dose escalation period;
2) if they miss three or more consecutive doses OR if they miss one dose or two 
consecutive doses at more than two occasions during maintenance period.
The total maximum number of allowable missed doses during the entire treatment period is six, i.e., two during the dose escalation and four during the maintenance period.
Patients should be instructed to return all unused trial medication (cartons with the pre-filled 
syringes), and the empty cartons from used trial medication, to the site at the next site visit. Compliance will be determined by [CONTACT_14523].

Investigator may wait until the results from central reading are available, and the 
randomization visit may be rescheduled.
After the patient is randomised, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/QTc interval 
from baseline or any other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified, the Investigator will assess the symptoms (e.g., palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], near syncope, and syncope) and decide if the patient will continue in the trial. The Investigator must also ensure that patient does not meet any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], such as tachycardia, arrhythmia or conduction disorders ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Any new findings or deterioration of 
previous findings observed during the trial will be recorded as AEs or SAEs and should be 
followed up and/or treated as medically appropriate per local standards.
Although the ECGs are transmitted to the vendor for central reading, the Investigator has the 
responsibility to complete an initial review as s oon as the ECG recordings are obtained at the 
site visit. At any time during the trial, the Investigator may decide to place a hold on further dosing of the patient if there is an indication of significant abnormalities in the ECG and would prefer to wait until the results from the central reading are available.
All ECGs that are read in the central location will be stored in the vendor’s database and will 
be transmitted to the Sponsor periodically.

The C-SSRS has been widely used in large  multinational clinical trials. The C-SSRS will be 
administered at the screening visit (using the “baseline/screening” version) with the aim to exclude subjects with a lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior. After the baseline visit, the assessment “since last visit” will be performed at clinic visits as specified in the Flow Chart . The Investigator is to review positive and negative reports for plausibility and 
clinical relevance. Doubtful reports may be repeated, or reports may be validated by a 
consulting psychiatrist. If there is a positive report of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type [ADDRESS_371411]. If the positive report is confirmed, appropriate actions for the patient’s safety must be initiated. Treatment with trial medication should be stopped and patient should be discontinued from the trial. Additionally, 
all C-SSRS reports of suicidal ideation type [ADDRESS_371412] 
be reported as separate SAEs by [CONTACT_737]. For ‘Self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent’ (Type 11) standard AE / SAE reporting rules are to be applied. For each negative report (suicidal ideation type 1, 2 or 3) after start of the trial, the Investigator is to decide based on clinical judgment whether it represents an AE as defined in the protocol, and if it is considered an AE then it must be reported accordingly.
[IP_ADDRESS] Self-monitoring of blood glucoseT2DM patients taking antidiabetic medication will be provided with a SMBG device for use 
at home during the treatment period for self-measurement of blood glucose. Patients may also use their own device for SMBG monitoring. The SMBG device will be dispensed to the patients at randomization (Visit 2). Instructions on the proper use of the SMBG equipment will be provided to the patient by [CONTACT_7893]. 
SMBG measurements in a fasted state (fasting for at least 10 hours) should be performed 
regularly. Recommendations are as follows:
∀daily during the treatment period;
∀at any time, they experience signs/ symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
Refer to Section 4.2.1 for information on handling of hypoglycemic events.

The following should also be recorded as an AE in the eCRF and BI SAE form (if 
applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions,
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_737].
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse eventA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers  to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23236]. 
For Japan only: the following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other 
reason”. AEs which possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered “Always Serious”In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by [CONTACT_15623], can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest 
list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_371416] (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g., the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
Hepatic injury is considered as AESI. It is defined by [CONTACT_303713][INVESTIGATOR_234103] [IP_ADDRESS] . and 
Section 10.1 .
These laboratory findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these 
laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF. 
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without laboratoryresults (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the Investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary, in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedur es described in the DILI checklist should be 
followed.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Adverse events requiring adjudicationPre-specified AEs critical for the assessment of safety of BI 456906 will be centrally 
adjudicated in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_303714] (CEC). Definitions of the adjudicated events and the principles of standardised data collection in the centralised CEC adjudication process are outlined in the separate CEC Charter. For further details refer to Section 8.7 .

• From signing the informed consent onwards until the individual patient’s end of trial: all 
AEs (serious and non-serious) and all AESIs.
• After the individual patient’s end of trial: the Investigator does not need to actively 
monitor the patient for new AEs but should only report any cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer, trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment relatedAESIs of which the Investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_23321], e.g., phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2), but not on the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_371421] report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours) to the Sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting pro cess will be provided in the ISF). The same 
timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the Investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable”, or no further information can be obtained.

The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the Sponsor’s unique  entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Studies (Part B).
The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part A and B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
The trial consists of a screening period, treatment period with a dose escalation and a 
maintenance period, and a follow-up period:
Screening : up to 10 weeks
Dose escalation : up to 24 weeksMaintenance : at least 24 weeks Follow-up : 4 weeks
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule specified in the Flow Chart with a time 
window for rescheduling. Any deviations from the planned visit schedule are to be 
documented. If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original 
visit schedule (calculated from the randomization Visit 2). Additional visits for the purpose of retesting laboratory paramaters or AE monitoring may be included as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737].
Approximately 40% of the visits is expected to be conducted remotely from patient’s home 
through Science [ADDRESS_371430] line of communication with the Investigator and/or site personnel via a video conferencing feature. If the patient does not feel comfortable with remote visits, these can be replaced by [INVESTIGATOR_36748]. However, such modification has to be arranged with the site personnel in a timely manner.
If visits to site are impossible because of COVID-19 or other unforeseen circumstances 
posing safety risks to patients, these visits may be performed as remote visits from patient’s home via Science [ADDRESS_371431] also taking into account that the next kit(s) of trial medication may need to be shipped to the patient’s home (refer to Section 4.1.4 ) and, that medical prerequisites, i.e., at minimum monthly safety laboratory 
tests and ECGs, should be fulfilled prior to shipment of new supplies.
All COVID-19 related deviations from the original schedule of visits and trial procedures will 
be documented, and the implications will be considered for the analysis of trial data.
Science 37 application will be installed on patient’s smartphone. Alternatively, a smartphone 
can be provisioned to the patient for the duration of the trial. Apart from using the video conferencing function, patients will complete eDiary  through the smartphone’s Science 37 app. Patients will be instructed on the use and access of Science 37 platform and on the use of the installed app at Visit 2.
For detailed description of trial procedures, please refer to the Flow Chart.Vital signs measurement and ECG recording should be performed before blood samples are 
taken.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_371432]-03 (18.0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Pregnancy tests:
All women of childbearing potential will undergo serum pregnancy test at the screening visit (Visit 1). The test will be done in the central laboratory. Patients with a positive result of the serum pregnancy test will be excluded from the trial. Urine pregnancy tests will be donemonthly starting from Visit 2. They will be done locally. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be done in the central laboratory to confirm pregnancy. If the serum pregnancy test is positive, trial medication will be discontinued, and patient will be discontinued from the trial.  If the serum pregnancy test is negative, the patient may continue in the trial. If the urine pregnancy test is positive at the randomization visit (Visit 2), the patient must not be randomised into the trial unless the serum pregnancy test is negative.
In the event of disruptive circumstances (e.g., pandemic, war) the investigational plan as per 
this clinical trial protocol may not be feasible at a site. In this case, Sponsor, and Investigator, 
with the informed consent of the patient, may agree on alternative, back-up methodology which may include but will not be limited to allowing local labs for safety assessments, providing options to either consider paper diaries or paper PROs for patients, and other measures that may be required to ensure trial continuity while mainitaining patient safety and 
data integrity of primary endpoint. 
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
6.2.1 Screening and run-in period(s)
Screening Period:
All patients must sign an informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines prior to any 
trial specific procedures. Please refer to Section 8.1 for details. If a patient is willing to 
provide blood and/or stool samples for biobanking, a separate consent must be obtained.
Once the patient has consented, the patient is considered as enrolled in the trial. The patient 
should be recorded on the enrolment log and registered in IRT.
The screening period, i.e., the period before the first administration of trial medication, starts 
at Visit 1 and may be as long as 10 weeks, but should be kept as short as possible. After all 
Visit 1 results including MR imaging are received and the patient is considered eligible, the Visit 1a for liver biopsy should be scheduled. When scheduling a liver biopsy as part of screening procedures sufficient time should be allowed to receive the results before preceding to Visit 2. In the event of logistical issues with the reporting of results by [CONTACT_112726](s) a patient who meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria should be considered for participation in the clinical trial even if he/ she exceeds the screening period of 10 weeks. Extension of the screening period requires a Sponsor approval. If more than 12 weeks elapse from Visit 1 safety  laboratory tests, ECG and vital signs should 
be repeated and results should be available before randomization.
Run-in Period:
There will be no run-in period in this trial.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_371433]-03 (18.0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019Demographics and Medical Conditions:
Information on race (if allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) will be collected because certain ethnic groups are at higher risk for NASH. Moreover, this information is required for the calculation of eGFR (CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420]). 
The following medical conditions will be specifically asked for: type and history of diabetes 
mellitus, history of arterial hypertension, history of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], history of cardiac dysrhythmias, and metabolic syndrome, alcohol and caffeine consumption, and nicotine use. In addition, information will be collected in the eCRF for relevant chronic diseases, current observable conditions and other relevant conditions (as per Investigator’s judgment) which may not be necessarily manifest at the day of examination, e.g., because therapy is given.
Re-screening and re-testing:
If patients discontinue from the trial during the screening period, no additional assessments or 
site visits are required. The patients will be marked as screen failures and registered as such in IRT. A patient may be re-screened once with the approval from the Clinical Trial Leader.Re-screening of a previously screen failed patients will be permitted providing the reasons for screen failure were reversible and have been resolved, based on Investigator’s judgement.The patient who will be re-screened needs to be re-consented and subsequently registered in IRT. A new patient number will be assigned. All procedures of Visit [ADDRESS_371434] be repeatedexcept for FibroScan
®and MR imaging. FibroScan®and MR imaging from the initial 
screening can be used if the assessments were performed within [ADDRESS_371435] can be repeated once without the patient having to be re-screened. 
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomised at Visit 2. After randomization, 
patients will start the treatment period which includes a dose escalation, followed by [CONTACT_303715] 3.1: 1 .
Unscheduled visits may be arranged if necessary. Procedures completed during an 
unscheduled visit will depend on the circumstances under which the visit was planned, and at 
the descretion of the Investigator. 
Measurement of vital signs should be performed before blood samples are taken (pre-dose) 
and approx. 10 minutes after dosing (post-dose).
Data concerning adverse events and concomitant medications will be collected throughout 
the trial, as specified in the Flow Chart . These data will be obtained at scheduled or

For this purpose, the primary analysis uses methodology for dose finding employing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod).
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
For both the primary endpoint (improvement from baseline in NASH and no worsening in 
fibrosis at Week 48) and the secondary endpoint (at least 30% reduction in liver fat content assessed by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF at Week 48), the null hypothesis is that there is a flat dose response curve across the placebo and the BI [ADDRESS_371442] protecting the overall probability of Type I error (one sided 5%).Additionally, the probability to continue the program with a non-effective drug is further limited by [CONTACT_303716] “delta” relative to placebo is achieved (see 
Section 7.5 for details). The pre-specified models and their parameters used are outlined in 
Section 7.2.2 and Section 7.2.3 , respectively.
No confirmatory hypothesis testing is planned to  be performed in this trial. Where p-values 
are given, these are to be interpreted as explora tory. Given the exploratory nature of the trial, 
no adjustment will be made to Type I error levels for the testing of the null hypothesis of flat dose response on more than one endpoint.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
Analysis Sets
Statistical analysis will be based on the following analysis sets: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomised patients who received at least one 
dose of trial treatment (efficacy analysis).
The Treated Set (TS) is defined the same as the FAS (safety analysis).The Per Protocol Set (PPS) is defined as all patients in the FAS who were without an 
important protocol deviation relevant for efficacy.

If a non-flat dose-response relationship is established, the statistically significant (best fitting) 
model(s) from the above candidate set will be refitted to the data to generate new estimates for all model parameters from the data. The target dose(s) will be estimated from the best fitting model(s) by [CONTACT_303717] (“delta”) and accounting for safety.
The primary analysis will be performed using the FAS, as defined in Section 7.2.1 . 
The primary MCPMod analysis will use the actual maintenance dose (i.e., as treated). Actual 
maintenance dose is defined as the dose the patient was receiving at the start of the maintenance period (which is expected to be one of the planned maintenance doses). Rules for handling any special situations (e.g., any patient who was not receiving the same dose at the end of the maintenance period as at the start of the maintenance period) will be addressed in the TSAP. Any patient who discontinued treatment prior to starting the maintenance period will be assigned to the next target maintenance dose up from the last dose which was tolerated during the dose escalation period.

For the binary secondary endpoint of a one stage decrease in fibrosis stage after 48 weeks, a 
logistic regression analysis will be performed and used to obtain covariate-adjusted odds ratios between active BI 456906 doses and placebo. The logistic regression model will include the same model terms as specified in Section 7.2.2 . Where biopsy data are available

will be used directly to determine the response for such patients (similarly to Section 7.2.2).
MCPMod dose finding analyses are not planned to be performed for secondary endpoints, 
other than as specified above for the MRI-PDFF responder endpoint. If additional MCPMod

Adverse events will be coded using the Me dical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period (REP), a period of [ADDRESS_371449] dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
Safety analyses will be performed on the TS, using the actual maintenance treatment received. 
Key safety analyses will also be performed using the randomised maintenance treatment (if this is different for any patient). 
In general, safety analyses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No 
hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e., all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_195912] (MedDRA) at database lock.
The adjudicated events will be summarised descriptively for each treatment group.Laboratory data will be analysed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patien ts with abnormal values or clinically relevant 
abnormal values.

probability to (1) obtain a significant test for non-flat dose-response curve and (2) to observe for at least one of the modelled doses an effect difference of at least delta compared to placebo.
The sample size calculation is based on an assumed maximum difference in the primary 
endpoint responder rate (BI 456906 vs. placebo) of 25%, as well as on the pre-specified models listed in Section 7.2.2 . For placebo, a response rate of 20% at Week 48 will be 
considered [ R16-5487 ; R16-5489 ; R18-2781 ].
Using a total sample size of 240 evaluable patients (60 per treatment group), the probability
of a successful trial (as defined above) was estimated using simulations. For each dose group, samples of the required size were drawn from a binomial distribution.
Based on these assumptions, the success probab ility under a delta of 20% (i.e., non-flat curve 
achieved, and at least one BI [ADDRESS_371456] 20%) is 
approximately 76% when assuming a linear dose response curve. Assuming a different form

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_371457]-03 (18.0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019for the underlying dose response curve (Emax, exponential, quadratic), the success probability is between 73% and 82% (data not shown). For a delta of 10% the respective success probability is 92% assuming a linear dose response shape, and between 92% and 95% for the other dose response shapes (data not shown).
If the difference between placebo and active BI456906 doses is low, i.e., 5% (which is 
assumed to be clinically not relevant) the success probability is approximately 2% and 16% for a delta of 20% and 10%, respectively (assuming a linear dose response curve). In the case 
that there is no treatment benefit, the false positive probability is limited by [CONTACT_941] α-level for the 
significance testing of the non-flat dose-response curve of 5% (one-sided). Additionally, this probability is further reduced by [CONTACT_303719]. Thereby, the probability of a false decision for a non-effective drug is reduced to less than 1% for a delta of 20% and remains at less than 5% for a delta of 10%.
Due to tolerability issues it is possible th at not all patients in the higher dose groups can be 
uptitrated to their randomised dose. Since the primary analysis is planned “as treated”, this may result in lower sample sizes in highest dose groups and respectively higher sample sizes in lower dose groups. Therefore, in addition to the intended equal allocation, four variations of this sampling ratio have been considered. The first [ADDRESS_371458] dose only (i.e., 60-60-70-50 and 60-70-70-40 for placebo, BI 456906 2.4 mg, BI 456906 4.8 mg and BI 456906 6.0 mg, respectively). The second [ADDRESS_371459] two doses (60-80-50-50 and 60-90-50-40 for placebo, BI 456906 2.4 mg, BI 456906 4.8 mg and BI 456906 6.0 mg, respectively). The resulting overall success probabilities do not differ meaningfully from those of the originally planned sampling sheme.Table 7.5: 1 provides success probabilities under different scenarios (i.e., different treatment 
effects and allocation ratios).

Treatment with trial medication should be discontinued if:
- ALT or AST increases to ≥8x ULN

If a patient develops elevations of ALT or AST to ≥3x baseline or ≥300 U/L (whichever is 
lower) with total bilirubin normal* and no liver-related symptoms, the testing should be repeated within [ADDRESS_371489], then close observation (testing and physical examination 2 to 3 times a week) should be implemented, and discontinuation of trial medication should be considered. Decision to discontinue the trial medication should be considered based on factors that include how much higher than baseline ALT and AST values were relative to ULN and how much the on-tr eatment ALT and AST values have increased 
relative to baseline.
Treatment with trial medication should be discontinued if:
- baseline values were < 2x ULN, and ALT or AST increases to ≥5x baseline 
values
- baseline values were ≥ 2x ULN but ≤5x ULN, and ALT or AST increases to ≥3x 
baseline values
- ALT or AST increases ≥2x baseline values or ≥300 U/L (whichever is lower)
and the increase is accompanied by a concomitant increase in total bilirubin to ≥
2x ULN** or INR concomitantly increases by > 0.2 (to prevent false positive results, another sample should be tested within 24 hours)
- ALT or AST increases ≥2x baseline values or ≥300 U/L (whichever is lower)

Description of change Removed stratification variable for country (Rest 
of World/China). Only presence of diabetes (Yes/No) is retained for stratification purposes, irrespective of country.
Rationale for change Since China is not being handled differently from 
other countries with regard to 1) inclusion in the primary analysis and the expected timely availability of biopsy data to permit this, and 2) the use of the same central pathology reader as other countries, there is no longer any reason for the additional stratification.

Description of change 1. Added information on hepatitis B patients
2. Corrected numbering of exclusion criteria from 
No. 3 to No. 20
3. Modified the cut-off for eGFR4. Modified the cut-off for platelet count5. Added information on patient participation in 
another interventional trial
Rationale for change 1. Clarification
2. Correction of the previous formatting error3. Patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment represent a relevant part of our target patient population. Data from a recently completed clinical trial in patients with T2DM that included patients with a baseline eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73m
2or higher show that the 
overall summary of adverse events in patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m
2was largely in 
line with that of patients with eGFR ≥ 60 
mL/min/1.73m2.
Furthermore, publicly available eligibility criteria of other GLP-1R agonist based compounds included patients with eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73m
2and this did 
not represent a safety concern for the patients. GLP-1R agonists with a marketing authorization do not require dose adjustments for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
4. Liver cirrhosis is accurately ruled out by 
[CONTACT_303726], therefore patients without any sign of liver cirrhosis and a platelet count > 110 x10
9/L are assumed to have a non-
significant risk of suffering from portal hypertension.

Description of change Modified information on purpose of the interim 
analysis and access to unblinded data from the interim analysis
Rationale for change Considering that the mean BMI of patients 
recruited in this trial is approx. 36 kg/m2, data on 
liver fat reduction (and liver benefit in general) in this patient category are very informative for the future development program of BI 456906 in chronic weight management, going into phase IIIby Q4/2023. The availability of this data will help enrolling the best patient population into the trial(s), targeting patients who may benefit most. As the phase II trial in chronic weight management (1404-0036) has not generated liver data, as opposed to 1404-0043, it is important to inform investigators, study personnel, patients and their relatives involved in the phase III program of BI 456906 in chronic weight management about these benefits in a timely manner, considering that the updated version of the Investigator Brochure (planned issue in Q4 2023) will not include interim analysis data and, importantly, will not be able to appropriately reach and inform patients and caregivers.The availability of this data will help positioning BI 456906 among the available drugs in development for chronic weight management, independently of the NASH indication.

1.0 HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Hypothesis 
Lenalidomide and prednisone in comb ination are effective and to lerable 
treatment for patients with  myelofibrosis (MF). 
1.2 Objectives 
Primary:  To determine the effi cacy of lenalidomide and prednisone in 
combination in patients with MF, i n achieving objective improvements in 
disease status: com plete and partial res ponse, hematological 
improvement. 
Secondary:  to determine the sa fety of lenalidomide and prednisone in 
combination, in patients with MF. 
Tertiary:  To examine pertinent mo rphological, biological, and molecular 
characteristics of MF in patient samples during therapy with le nalidomide 
and prednisone. 
2.[ADDRESS_738112] asia (MF) is a rare [0.73 per 100,000 
person years in males and 0.4 per  100,000 person y ears in females in the 
[LOCATION_008]] clonal proliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell.  
This clone subsequently induces  fibrogenic cytokines and/or gro wth 
factors in the marrow, which sti mulate the deposition of extrac ellular 
matrix proteins by [CONTACT_561775].  Megakaryocytic hyperplasia-
dysplasia is frequently observed.  Invasion of the blood stream  and 
colonization of extramedullary s ites ensues, resulting in organ omegaly and 
splenomegaly. Extensive marrow fibr osis and osteos clerosis may be 
observed in advanced MF, resulting in “dry taps”.   The entity of MF can be either  idiopathic (primary or agnogenic  myeloid 
metaplasia), or representative of end-stage myeloproliferative diseases 
such as polycythemia vera (PV) o r essential thrombocythemia (ET ).  MF 
occurs in 25% to 50% of patients with PV and in 2% to 3% of pat ients with 
ET.  In the early cellular phase of MF with minimal marrow fibr osis, the 
differential diagnosis includes Philadelphia-positive CML, PV, and ET that 
 
 
must be distinguished, based on cytogenetics and clinicopatholo gic 
features.  Other entities tha t can induce myelophthisis include  
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) , metastatic malignancies, lympho ma, 
Hodgkin’s disease, and plasma ce ll dyscrasias.  MF must be diff erentiated 
from acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AML, M7 of the French-Ameri can-
British classification) and CML with fibrosis. In acute megakaryocytic leukemia patients usually pres ent with severe constitutional sy mptoms 
and pancytopenia but wit hout organomegaly or peripheral blood 
myelophthisis. 
 Thus, the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_561765] (e.g., 
cachexia, night sweats, fatigue, fever), splenomegaly, anisopoi kilocytosis 
with teardrop erythrocytes, prog ressive anemia, immature myeloi d and 
erythroid precursors in the per ipheral blood, elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and fibr osis of the marrow (as eval uated by 
[CONTACT_320873] [collagen] stains).  The leukoerythroblastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_561766] h the intramedullary sinusoidal marrow and 
splenic hematopoiesis.  
 The disease generally occurs in adults, with the median age ranging from 
54 to 62 years; 70% of the pati ents are over t he age of 50 year s.  In 40% 
of the patients, constitutional symptoms are present, including  fever, 
weight loss, nocturnal sweating, pruritus, and bone pain.  Splenomegaly is 
present in 85% to 100% of the pat ients at diagnosis, and is massive in 
10%.  Hematologic disease featur es include anemia in 50% to 70%  at 
diagnosis and 25% will have severe  anemia with hemoglobin level  < 8.0 
gm/dL.  Approximatel y half of the patients present with an elevated white 
cell count (WBC), 28% with throm bocytosis (plat elet count > 500  x 10 9/L, 
and 37% with thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 x 10 9/L).  
Circulating blast ce lls are present in one-third of the patient s. 
 
Complications of MF are varied.  T hrombotic obliteration of int rahepatic 
veins and splenomegaly may lead to portal hypertension; severe cases 
may be associated with ascites and/or variceal bleeding.  Left upper 
quadrant pain may herald splenic infarction; epi[INVESTIGATOR_561767]-
limited and may persist for sever al days.  Supportive care meas ures such 
as analgesics and hydration are usually suffic ient; refractor
 y cases may 
require splenectomy or irradiati on. Extramedullary hematopoiesi s (EMH) 
may occur in locations other t han the liver or spleen; involvem ent of such 
sites may be managed by [CONTACT_6398]-dose ir radiation.  Liver involvemen t is 
associated with increased leve ls of plasma alkaline phosphatase.  Clinical 
manifestations of EMH include cardiac tamponade, papular skin n odules, 
pleural effusions, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]. 
 
 
Autoimmune phenomena hav e been observed, including Coomb’s posi tive 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, nephrotic syndr ome, antinuclear 
antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and lupus-type anticoagulant.  P ostulated 
etiologies include clonality o f the lymphoid population or activation by 
[CONTACT_320874]-macrophage interaction with the immune system . 
Adverse prognostic factors for survival include older age and a nemia 
(hemoglobin < 10 gm/dL).  The etiology for the latter finding i s usually 
multifactorial and related bot h to marrow failure and hypersple nism.  Poor 
prognosis has also been correlat ed with leukocytosis, leukopeni a, 
circulating blasts, increased num bers of granulocyte precursors , 
thrombocytopenia, abnormal karyotype, and hypercatabolic sympto ms.  
The course of the disease is highly variable.  Median survival from time of diagnosis ranges from 3 to 6 years ; survival rates at 2 and 5 years are 
68% and 40%, respectively.  Progressive marrow failure, transformation into acute myeloid leukemia, and portal hypertension lead to de mise. 
Various prognostic models have been devised, with only hemoglob in at 
diagnosis a consistent prognostic factor among several studies.   Other 
parameters included constitutional  symptoms, thrombocytopenia, and 
percentage of WBC precursors.

Age of the patient and abnormal ka ryotype are two additional pr ognostic 
features. The median survival o f young, low-risk patients can r ange from 
13 to 15 years.  Overall median survival is estimated between 3  and 6 
years with infections, thrombosis and/or hemo rrhage, and transf ormation 
to leukemic phase frequently leadi ng to death.  Patients withou t any 
adverse features may survive as long as [ADDRESS_738113] com monly 
used agent in the proliferativ e phases of the disease.  Interfe ron-alpha had 
yielded hematologic responses  and reductions in splenomegaly 
(definitions varying among studies ) in 30% to 50% of patients, especially 
those with proliferative phas e, however, this agent tends to be poorly 
 
 
tolerated.  Agents used for the management of anemia include an drogens 
and/or erythropoietin.  Splenectomy  and/or splenic irradiation have been 
used to manage symptomatic spl enomegaly.  Splenectomy has been 
associated with risk of leukemia transformation in some series,  and 
splenic irradiation can result  in severe myelosuppression. 
No medical therapy has been proven to prolong overall survival for these patients. Patients with an inta ct quality of life and no threat ening 
hematologic abnormalities, such as  erythrocytosis  or thrombocyt osis, have 
usually been considered to not r equire any therapy; however, ne w 
therapeutic modalities ar e currently being co nsidered in determ ining 
treatment indications. 
In vitro data suggests that cytok ines elaborated by [CONTACT_561776] c ollagens. 
In patients with MF, increased levels of transforming growth fa ctor-beta 
(TGF-beta) have been observed in circulating peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) of megakaryocytic lineage.   
Increased levels of basic fibroblas t growth factor (bFGF) have also been 
reported in patients with MF.  Bo th TGF-beta and bFGF are membe rs of 
multifunctional polypeptide fam ilies that regulate cell growth and 
differentiation.  In addition to their potent fibrogenic activi ty, TGF-beta and 
bFGF regulate hematopoiesis by [CONTACT_561777] s tem cells. 
Expression of TGF-beta in early CD34+ hemat opoietic stem cells 
negatively regulated the cycle status; this effect could be abr ogated by 
[CONTACT_561778].  In addition, bFGF has been shown to augment the activity  of stem 
cell factor (SCF), interleukin -3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage  colony 
stimulating factor (GM-CSF), o r erythropoietin on committed progenitor 
cells.  Other cytokines/proteins  that are disregulated in MF in clude; tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a lpha) and angiogeni c agents like va scular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF).   
Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) has mu ltiple biological effects, inc luding the 
regulation of hematopoiesis, immune responses, and acute phase 
reactions.  IL-[ADDRESS_738114] higher IL-6 levels. 
2.2 Introduction to Lenalidomide  
Lenalidomide is the lead compound in a proprietary class of Cel gene 
compoun ds know n as IMi 
Ds® wi th immunomodulatory and anti-
angiogenic properties that could c onfer antitumor  and antimetas tatic 
effects. It is a derivative of t halidomide, combining higher ef ficacy and 
lower toxicity than its paren t compound. Lenalidomide has been 
demonstrated to possess anti- angiogenic activity through inhibi tion of 
 
 
bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha induced endothelial cell migration, du e at 
least in part to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation response to bFGF.  In 
addition, lenalidomide has a var iety of immunomodulatory effect s.  
Lenalidomide stimulates T cell pr oliferation, and the production of IL-2, IL-
10 and IFN-gamma, inhibits IL-1 beta and IL-6 and modulates IL- 12 
production.  
Clinical experience in solid tumors with lenalidomide 
Twenty patients with varying ty pes of solid tumors (13 with mal ignant 
melanoma, 2 each with carcinom a of the pancreas  and non-small-c ell lung 
cancer [NSCLC], [ADDRESS_738115] carcinoma, and 
carcinoid-unknown primary) were enrolled in a Phase 1 study of 
lenalidomide conducted at the S t. George Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], London, [LOCATION_006].  This was 
a non-randomized, open-label with-in  patient dose-escalation de sign, 
where patients start ed on 5 mg/day for 7 days and then increased their 
dose every 7 days to 10 mg/day, 25 mg/day, a nd 50 mg/day for a total of [ADDRESS_738116] enrolled 20 pa tients, 
including 18 patients with recu rrent high-grade gliomas and 2 w ith other 
refractory CNS malignancies (1 rec urrent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_561768] d 1 
multiple recurrent spi[INVESTIGATOR_561769]) into a phase I tri al of 
lenalidomide given on Days 1  through 21 every 28 days.  Treatme nt has 
been well tolerated with 1 grade  2 myelosuppression as the only  toxicity > 
grade 1.  
 
In an ongoing phase I trial in patients with  refractory metasta tic cancer 
conducted through the NCI, [ADDRESS_738117] been enroll ed.  Lenalidomide w as 
administered in daily doses of 5 mg (3 patients), 10mg (3 patien ts) and 
20mg (6 patients).  Dose limiti ng toxicity was seen at 20mg/day  (1 grade 3 
thrombosis and 1 grade 3 hypotension).  Stable PSA values for a t least [ADDRESS_738118] (28 day cycle).  Treat ment 
continued until the patient devel oped disease progression or intolerable 
adverse events occurred.  Inter im analysis failed to show an ad vantage of 
one regimen over the other  with res pect to s urvival.  Analysis of response 
rates is pending.  The toxicity p rofile was similar in both dos e groups and 
the most frequent adverse events were fatigue, seen in 32% of p atients, 
followed by [CONTACT_80188] , seen in 24% and 20% of patients 
respectively.  Neutropenia and th rombocytopenia were seen in 2. 4% and 
2.0% of patients respectively.  G rade 3 and 4 toxicities were s een 
infrequently (<15%). 
 
 
 
A second phase III randomized tria l compared a lenalidomide dose of [ADDRESS_738119] (28 day cycle) to  placebo in 
patients with metastatic melanoma.  Three hundred and five patients enrolled on this study and a preplanned interim analysis failed to 
demonstrate a surviv al advantage.  Response rates are being ana lyzed.  
The toxicity profile was favor able and similar to the previous phase III 
study.
 
 
Clinical experience in multiple myeloma with lenalidomide 
In [ADDRESS_738120] been 
treated with lenalidomide.  In one study at the University of A rkansas, 15 
patients who relapsed or were refractory to high dose melphalan therapy 
with stem cell transplant were tr eated for 4 weeks in an open-label safety 
study and were permitted to cont inue therapy in an extension ph ase of the 
trial.  Patient cohorts were tr eated at the following daily dos es: 5mg, 
10mg, 25mg, and 50mg.  In a simila r study at the Dana Farber Cancer 
Institute, 27 patients with rapi [INVESTIGATOR_561770].  Anti-myeloma activity was observed in each of t hese 2 
phase I studies.  Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts w ere the 
dose-limiting toxicities associa ted with lenalidomide.  The max imum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was not r eached within [ADDRESS_738121] widely 
used in future studies has been lenalidomide on Days 1-21, repe ated 
every 28 days.   Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma 
patients treated in t he phase I studies.  Abs orption was found to be rapid 
on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to maxim um blood levels rang ing 
from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg).  
Plasma lenalidomide declined in  a monophasic manner with elimination 
half-life ranging from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at  all 4 doses. 
 No plasma accumulation was obse rved with multiple daily dosing .  Peak 
and overall plasma concentration s were dose proportional over t he dosing 
range of 5mg to 50mg. 
 
A multicenter, randomized, phase  II trial compared 2 syncopated dose 
schedules of lenalidomide used al one or in combination with 
dexamethasone in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multip le 
myeloma.  All patients were tr eated on Days 1-21 of a 28-day cy cle.  
Patients treated with  15mg BID experienced  more myelosuppressio n and 
dose reductions compared with patients treat ed with 30mg daily.   Anti-
myeloma activity was observed with each dose and schedule of single 
agent lenalidomide.  The addition of dexamethas one to lenalidom ide 
yielde d responses in some patients w
ho had not responded to 
lenalidomide alone. 
 
 
 
A phase I/II trial of Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®), vincristi ne, 
dexamethasone (DVd) and lenalidom ide in heavily pretreated 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients is ongoing.  The MTD of 
lenalidomide was 10mg on Days 1-21 in combination with Doxil® 40mg/m2 IVPB on Day 1, vincristine 2mg IVP on Day 1 and 
dexamethasone 40mg PO on Days 1-4 cycled ev ery 28 days.  All patients 
received amoxicillin, acyclovir and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81mg prophylactical ly.  The 
dose limiting toxicity with lena lidomide 15mg on Days 1-21 in c ombination 
with DVd was sepsis/septic shock.  Additional phase I trials of  
lenalidomide with chemotherapy in advanced malignancies are in progress. 
 
Celgene Corporation sponsored 2 multicenter, randomized, double -
blinded, placebo-controlled phase  III trials [1 U.S. (MM-009) a nd 1 
international (MM-010)] in patient s with relapsed or refractory  multiple 
myeloma.  More than [ADDRESS_738122] s

Clinical experience in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with 
lenalidomide 
An exploratory trial in 43 MDS patients with transfusion depend ent or 
symptomatic anemia was conducted at the University of Arizona.  Patients 
received lenalidomide at doses of 25mg or 10mg per day, or of 1 0mg on 
Days 1-21, repeated every 28 da ys.  All patients had had no res ponse to 
erythropoietin or had a high endogenous erythropoietin level.  Response 
rates were similar across the 3 dose schedules used.  Responses  were 
observed in 24 patients overall (56%) including 21 patients wit h a major 
response and 20 patients with  sustained transfusion independenc e.  
Patients with a major response reached a median hemoglobin leve l of 
13.2 grams per deciliter, with a corresponding 5.3 grams per de ciliter 
median increase from baseline.  After a median follow-up of 81 weeks, the 
median duration of major res ponse had not been reached and was more 
than 48 weeks.  Of 20 patients wi th karyotypic abnormalities, 10 (50%) 
patients had a complete cytogenet ic remission.  The response ra te was 
highest in patients with a clonal  interstitial del etion involvi ng chromosome 
5q31.1 (10 out of 12, 83%).  Neut ropenia and thrombocytopenia w ere the 
most common adverse events, and resulted in dos e delays or redu ctions 
in 25 patients (58%). 
 
Celgene Corporation sponsored a multicenter trial (MDS-003) of 148 MDS 
patients with a clonal interstit ial deletion involving chromoso me 5q31.1.  
Lenalidomide was given at a dos e of 10mg on Days 1-21, repeated  every 
28 days, to 44 patients, and at a dose of 10mg daily to the oth er 104 
patients.  Transfusion independence was achieved in 93 patients  (64%), 
with a median hemoglobin increa se of 3.9g/dl. Cytogenetic respo nse was 
achieved in 76% of transfusion  independent patients with 55% ac hieving a 
cytogenetic complete response. Pat hologic complete response was  
documented in 32 out o f 110 (29%) evaluable patients.  With a m edian 
follow-up of 9.3 months, the median response duration had not b een 
reached.  Neutropenia (39%) and thrombocytopenia (35%) were the  most 
common adverse events requiring dose delays or reductions. 
 
Another Celgene sponsored trial (M DS-002) in patients with low to 
intermediate-[ADDRESS_738123] low to inter mediate-1 risk MD S.  Among the p atients 
with documented low to  intermediate-1 risk  MDS, 84 patients ( 5
1%) 
responded to treatment.  Trans fusion independence was achieved in 54 
patients (33%) and 30 pat ients (18%) achieved a minor response,  defined 
as a 50% or greater decrease in blood transfusion requirement.  The 
median duration of transfusion-independence was 41 weeks.  The median 
baseline hemoglobin level was 8.0g/dl, which increased by 3.2g/ dl in 
 
 
responding patients.  Among 20 patients ev aluable for cytogenet ic 
response, 9 patients (45%) ex perienced a cytogenetic remission.   
Lenalidomide is indicated for the  treatment of patients with transfusion-
dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality  with or 
without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.  REVLIMID
® (lenalidomide) is approved by [CONTACT_1622].  Revlimid® is 
indicated for the treatment o f patients with transfusion-depend ent anemia 
due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deleti on 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality, with or  without additional cytogenetic  
abnormalities.  REVLIMID® in combi nation with dexamethasone is 
indicated for the treatment of m ultiple myeloma patients who ha ve 
received at least one prior therapy.   
Clinical experience in myelofibr osis with myeloid metaplasia wi th 
lenalidomide 
A Phase II single agent study o f lenalidomide in MF was recentl y 
performed at MDACC.  Forty one pa tients with platelet count of at least 30 
x 10
9/L were treated with 10mg/day ora l lenalidomide. Thirty six pat ients 
(88%) had received prior treatment s, including thalidomide. Twe nty 
patients were evaluable for res ponse and toxicity at the last r eview. 
Responses were observed in approximately 50% of the evaluable p atients 
including CR in 2 patients (nor malization of hemoglobin and WBC  counts), 
PR in 2 patients (improvement i n platelet and hemoglobin, and in 
splenomegaly), hematologic improv ement in 6 patients (improveme nts in 
spleen size, platelets and WBC) and transfusion independence in  3 of 13 
patients. Common toxicities included rash (29%) and pruritus (2 0%). 
Grade > 3 toxicities included th rombocytopenia (2 patients), ne utropenia 
(1 patient), rash (1 patient ), and fatigue (1 patient).   
 
In another Phase II study of s ingle agent lenalidomide in MF, T efferi et al 
reported approximately 20% impro vement in anemia. Some of these  
responses were dramat ic and associated wi th specific cytogenetic 
abnormalities. In addition, they r eported documentation of posi tive drug 
effect on constitutional sympt oms, LDH, and splenomegaly in pat ients 
who did not show early response with anemia, suggesting the lik elihood 
of higher responses with longer duration of therapy.  
Adverse Events with Lenalidomide   
Most frequently reported adverse e vents reported during clinica l studies 
with lenalidomide in oncologic and non-oncologic indications, r egardless of 
presumed relationship to study  medication include: anemia, neut ropenia, 
thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomi ting 
and diarrhea, dehydration, rash , itching, infections, sepsis, p neumonia, 
UTI, Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], cellulitis, atrial fibrillation, congestive

Steroid preparations are comm only used as therapy for MF. Furth ermore, 
when used in combination with other medications (e.g. thalidomide) they 
improve tolerance of  those medications and improve results. While there 
is no experience with lenalidomi de and steroids in combination in MF, 
extensive research has been done in multiple m yeloma. The combination 
has been well tolerat ed and has demonstrated synergy in the rel apsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma setting. Based on these results , the 
Eastern Oncology Cooperative Gr oup has recently started a Phase II 
multicenter trial of the combi nation of lenali domide and predni sone in MF, 
similar to this clinical study. It is expected that the combina tion will 
improve the tolerance of lena lidomide with subsequent improveme nt in the 
results of therapy.

5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
The planned dose and schedule of inv estigation of lenalidomide is 10 mg/day 
orally (unless blood platel et count is below 100 x10
9/L, in which case the 
starting dose of lenalidomide is  5 mg/day).  Lenalidomide will be taken orally in 
the morning each day on days 1-[ADDRESS_738128]  study staff 
immediately.  Twenty eight day s is considered one cycle of ther apy.  Attempts 
will be made to provide an adequate treatment period of at leas t 6 months 
unless significant toxicity observed, to account for delayed ti me to response 
observed with biologic agents.  Responders will continue therapy  for 2 years 
unless progression of disease or to xicity warranting discontinu ation of therapy 
is observed.  Prednisone will be used orally a t the dose of 30 mg/day during cycle 1, 15 
mg/day during cycle 2, and 15 mg e very other day during cycle 3, and then it 
will be discontinued. 
 
All patients will be registered on the Pa tient Data Management System 
(PDMS) at MD Anderson Cancer Cent er after the informed consent is signed.  
Medication will be mailed to par ticipants, per the RevAssist® P rogram.

prednisone after initial cycle of therapy.  Dose escalation will only be 
allowed for patients who have not had any grade [ADDRESS_738129] of the patient, and approved by [INVESTIGATOR_97159]. 
 
5.3 Prednisone Dose Modifications 
 
 
 
Dose modifications/discontinuat ion for prednisone therapy will be at the 
discretion of the clinician bu t must be documented clearly when  it 
happens. Prednisone dose modificati on/discontinuation will not require 
withdrawal from the study; the patient may continue taking lena lidomide 
alone. Treatment of hyperglycemia with either oral hypoglycemic  agents or 
insulin does not necessarily requi re discontinuation of prednis one if the 
hyperglycemia is controlle d with these medications. 
 
 
5.4 Initiation of a New Cycle of Therapy 
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a  new cycle 
if: 
 The ANC is ≥  1,000/μL; 
 The platelet count is ≥  50x109/L if ≥100x109/L before starting therapy, or 
at least 50% of the pre-therapy value if <100x109/L before starting 
therapy; 
 Any lenalidomide-related allergic reaction/hypersensitivity or  sinus 
bradycardia/ other cardiac arrhyt hmia adverse event that may ha ve 
occurred has resolved to  ≤ grade 1 severity; 
 Any other lenalidomide-related adverse event that may have occ urred 
has resolved to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_738130] will be 
evaluated weekly and a new cycle  of lenalidomide (with/without prednisone 
after cycle 3) will not be initiated until the toxicity has resolved as described above.    
If lenalidomide dosing was omitted for the remainder of the pre vious cycle or 
if the new cycle is delayed due to toxicity newly encountered o n the 
scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be started with a one- level dose 
reduction.  If the toxicity has not resolved as described above  within [ADDRESS_738131] of the 
patient (for example, responding patient with neutropenia or lo w platelets, 
that resolve past 4 weeks may be restarted on therapy); this ca se must be 
fully documented. 
 
5.5 Concomitant Therapy 
All medications (prescription and non-prescription), treatments  and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_561772], mus t be recorded 
on the source documents.   
The use of filgrastim (G-CSF) for subjects in this study is per mitted when 
used to treat neutropenia secondar y to therapy. Ery thropoietin therapy is not 
allowed. Subjects should receive  full supportive care, includin g transfusions of 
 
 
blood products, antibiotics and antiemetics and prophylactic treatment for 
potential hypersensitivity reacti ons and tumor lysis syndrome w hen 
appropriate.  
Prophylactic Anticoagulation: 
Lenalidomide increases the risk o f thrombotic events in patient s who are at 
high risk or with a history of t hrombosis, in particular when c ombined with 
other drugs known to cause thro mbosis. When lenalidomide is com bined with 
other agents such as steroids ( e.g. dexamethas one, prednisone),  
anthracyclines (Doxil, adriamyci n) and erythropoietin the risk of thrombosis is 
increased.  Consideration should be given to the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  (81 or 325 mg) 
or some other form of prophylaxi s as deemed appropriate. Low molecular 
weight heparin may be utilized in patients  that are intolerant to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
Coumadin should be used with caut ion and close monitoring of IN R is 
required.

collection of dosing informat ion to monitor compliance. 
 
5.7 Pretreatment Evaluation  
The mandatory pre-treatment evaluation (within 2 weeks, unless otherwise 
specified) will be aimed at conf irming/establishing the diagnos is.  The 
evaluation will consist of a t horough assessment of the followi ng:  
 
 A complete primary evaluation with physical examination and de scription 
of constitutional symptoms 
 CBC, differential  
 Serum BUN, alkaline phosphatase, c reatinine, bilirubin, ALT, s odium, 
potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, glucose, lactate dehydroge nase 
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_22602] (within 3 months if no thera py was 
given, alternative within one m onth) to include staining for fi brosis and 
molecular test for JAK 2 mutation (blood test is acceptable alt ernative), 
cytogenetic studies, (within one year). 
 CD34+ cell count in blood 
 Serum or urine pregnancy test ( sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/ mL), 10 – 14 
days pre therapy and again within  24 hours of initiation of the rapy for all 
females of child bearing potentia l (FCBP).  Counseling for all men about 
the requirement for latex condom u se during sexual contact [CONTACT_561779] a minimum of every [ADDRESS_738133] udy drug and to not donate blood, sperm, 
or semen. Please refer to Appendix J. 
 T S H  
 E K G  
 Correlative studies (see secti on 10.0) every 3 months – option al. 
 Refer to Appendix K for pre- treatment evaluation schedule. 
 
In addition, the analysis of tota l and phosphorylated c-Jun pro tein in peripheral blood will 
be done. Sample processing will be performed in the laboratory of [CONTACT_561792]-
Ramos at MD Anderson, while sam ple analysis will take place at the Celgene 
Corporation. Samples will be obtained pre-therapy, after 6 and 18 months of therapy. 
Not all samples might be obtained at all time points. Periphera l blood will be collected 
into 2 specialized CPT 8 mL vacutainer tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell s
  
(PBMC) will be separated, pellet ed, lysed, and stored frozen at -70  C until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Samples will be coded so that pat ient confidentiality will be preserved. They will be 
 
 
shipped on dry ice to the Celgene Corporation, San Diego. Conta ct person is: Brydon

5.8 Evaluation During Study 
 
Time parameters for mandatory ev aluations during the study are:   +/-5 
days for blood tests, +/- two w eeks for bone marrow exams, and +/-2 
weeks for MD Anderson visits.  Exception for these rules can be  made in 
unusual circumstances (e.g. long holiday) if approved by [CONTACT_561780]. 
 
 Follow up visits at MD Anderson are required initially monthly  (+/- 1 week), 
with review of constitutional symptoms and physica l exam.  Foll owing the 
completion of cycle 3, patients that are on a stable dose of le nalidomide 
and have no serious drug related side effects, and the physicia n feels it is 
in the patients best interest, ma y return to MDA every three mo nths.  
Following the completion of cycle 24, patients that are on a st able dose of 
lenalidomide, have no serious drug related side effects, and th e physician 
feels it is in the pat ients best interest, may return to MDA ev ery 6 months 
(+/-2 weeks). Only one, 28 day  supply of Lenalidomide may be pr ovided to 
a patient per monthly cycle.  In  this case, a monthly phone ass essment of 
toxicity, review of required bl ood tests (pregnancy test if app licable) and 
confirmation of the requirements for the initiation of a new cycle must be 
done.   
 CBC with differential every other week x 8 , then every 1 month or more 
frequently as clinically indicated.  Following the completion of cycle 24, 
CBC every 1-3 months while  participating on the study.  
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_371848] 3 months (to include s taining for 
fibrosis); cytogenetics every 3 months if abnormal prior to the rapy; JAK2 
mutation analysis every 3 months if mutation present prior to therapy. Following the completion of Cycl e 24, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_561773], cytogenetics every year if abnor mal prior to therapy; JAK2 
every year if mutation present prior to therapy. 
 Serum BUN, alkaline phosphatase, c reatinine, bilirubin, ALT, s odium, 
potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, glucose, lactate dehydroge nase 
every other week x 6, then every 1 month. Following the complet ion of 
cycle 24, complete every 3-6 m onths while participating on the study 
 TSH every 3 months. Following t he completion of Cycle 24, TSH every 6 
months. 
 CD
34+ cell counts in blood ever y 3 months. Following the completion of 
Cycle 24 CD34+ every year. 
 Serum or urine pregnancy test ( sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/ mL) every 
week x 4, then monthly for all FCBP with regular menstrual cycl es, or 
every 2 weeks if irregular cycles. 
 Correlative studies (see secti on 10.0) every 3 months – option al. 
Following the completion of Cycle 24, correlative studies every  6 months-
optional. 
 Refer to Appendix K for Sc hedule of Events During Study

reason.  An excessive rate of w ithdrawals can render the study not 
interpretable; therefore, unnece ssary withdrawal of subjects sh ould be 
avoided.  Should a subject deci de to withdraw, or is being remo ved from 
the study, all efforts will be m ade by [CONTACT_561781] (as a progress note)  the observations as thoroughly as 
possible. The date of disconti nuation and reason(s) for patient  
discontinuation for the study w ill be recorded in the chart and  PDMS. An 
attempt to complete all evaluat ions which are required at the f inal study 
visit must be conducted for eac h patient who discontinues treat ment, 
regardless of the reason. 
Criteria for discontinuat ion of therapy include:  
 Clearly documented pr ogressive disease, or loss of a response;  
 No response within 6 mont hs from the start of therapy; 
 Severe toxicities not res ponding to dose adjustments; 
 Major protocol violation (i.e. noncompliance to protocol 
requirements);

In addition, we will attempt to validate in this study, recentl y published response 
criteria developed by [CONTACT_561782].  These 
criteria have not yet been us ed in any clinical study. 
 
 
 
 
Complete remission (CR):  Requires all of the following in the absence of 
both transfusion and grow th factor support;  
 Complete resolution of disease -related symptoms and signs incl uding 
palpable hepatosplenomegaly. 
 Peripheral blood count remission defined as hemoglobin > 11 g/ dL, 
platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and absolute neutroph il count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L. 
 Normal leukocyte differential  including disappearance of nucle ated red 
blood cells and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral smear,  in the 
absence of splenectomy.* 
 Bone marrow histological remiss ion defined as the presence of age-
adjusted normocellularity, < 5% myeloblasts, and an osteomyelof ibrosis 
grade of ≤ 1.**   
 
Partial remission (PR):  Requires all of the above cr iteria for CR except the 
requirement for bone marrow histological remission. However, a repeat bone 
marrow biopsy is required in t he assessment of PR and may or ma y not 
show favorable changes that do not  however fulfill criteria for  CR. 
 
Clinical improvement (CI):  Requires one of the follo wing in the absence of 
both disease progression (as out lined below) and CR/PR assignme nt (CI 
response is validated only if it lasts for ≥ 8 weeks).  
 A ≥ 2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin level or becoming transfusion 
independent (applicable only for pati ents with baseline hemoglo bin level 
of < 10 g/dL).§ 
 Either a ≥ 50% reduction in palpable splenomegaly of a spleen  that is ≥ 
10 cm at baseline or a spleen t hat is palpable at > 5 cm at bas eline 
becomes not palpable.§§ 
 A ≥ 100% increase in platelet count and an absolute platelet c ount of ≥ 
50,000 x 109/L. (applicable only for patients with baseline platelet count of 
< 50 x 109/L). 
 A ≥ 100% increase in ANC and an ANC of ≥ 0.5 x 109/L (applicable only 
for patients with baseline abs olute neutrophil count of < 1 x 1 09/L). 
 
Progressive disease : Requires one of the following;¶ 
 Progressive splenomegaly tha t is defined by [CONTACT_12127] a 
previously absent splenomegaly that is palpable at > 5 cm below  the 
left costal margin or a ≥ 100% i ncrease in palpable distance fo r 
baseline splenomegaly of 5-10 cm  or a ≥ 50% increase in palpable 
distance for baseline splenomegaly of > 10 cm. 
 Leukemic transformation confir med by a bone marrow blast count  of ≥ 
20%.  
 An increase in peripheral bl ood blast percentage of ≥ 20% that  lasts for 
≥ 8 weeks. 
 
Stable disease: None of the above. 
 
 
 
Relapse : Loss CR, PR, and CI. In other wor ds, a patient with CR or PR is 
considered to have undergone rel apse when he or she no longer f ulfils the 
criteria for CI. 
 
*Because of subjectivity in peripheral blood smear interpretation, CR does not 
require absence of morphological abnorma lities of red cells, platelets, and 
neutrophils.  
 ** In patients with CR, a complete cyt ogenetic response is defined as failure to 
detect a cytogenetic abnormality in cases wi th a pre-existing abnormality. A partial 
cytogenetic response is def ined as 50% or greater reduction in abnormal 
metaphases. In both cases, at least 20 bone marrow- or peripheral blood-derived 
metaphases should be analyzed. A major mo lecular response is defined as the 
absence of a specific dis ease-associated mutation in peripheral blood granulocytes 
of previously positive cases. In the absence of a cytogenetic/molecular marker, 
monitoring for treatment-induced inhibition of endogenous myeloid colony formation is encouraged. Finally, baseline and post-treatment bone marrow slides are to be stained at the same time and interpreted at  one sitting by a central review process. 
 
§Transfusion dependency is defined by a history of at least [ADDRESS_738137] month for a hemoglobin of < 8.5 g/dL that was not associated with clinically overt bleeding. Similarly, during protocol therapy, transfusions for a 
hemoglobin of ≥ 8.5 g/dL is discouraged unless it is clinically indicated. 
 
§§In splenectomized patients, palpable hepatom egaly is substituted with the same 
measurements. 
 
¶It is acknowledged that worsening cytopeni a might represent pr ogressive disease 
but its inclusion as a formal criteri on was avoided because of the difficulty 
distinguishing disease-associated from drug-induced myelosuppression. However, a 
decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, a 100% increase in transfusion requirement, 
and new development of transfusion dependenc y, each lasting for more than 3 
months after the discontinuation of prot ocol therapy can be considered disease 
progression.  
  
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
As per MDACC and Leukem ia phase I-II studies (Appendix C and Ap pendix F). 
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 3.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0 can be downloaded f rom the CTEP 
homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  All appropriate treatment areas should have

considered as medically important.   
Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting 
Toxicity will be scored using CTCA E Version 3.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov ).  All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE Vers ion 3.0.  All adverse clinica l experiences, whether 
observed by [CONTACT_093] o r reported by [CONTACT_102], must b e recorded, with details 
about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action ta ken with respect to the 
test drug, and the patient’s out come.  The investigator must ev aluate each adverse 
experience for its relationship  to the test drug and for its se riousness. 
 
The investigator must appraise a ll abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal labor atory result is considered clinically significant, the 
investigator must provide deta ils about the action taken with r espect to the test drug and 
about the patient’s outcome.  Serious Adverse Events Reporting:   The principle investigator h as the obligation to 
report all serious adverse events  to the University of [LOCATION_007] M.  D. Anderson Cancer 
Center (MDACC) IRB via the Offi ce of Protocol Research and to C elgene within [ADDRESS_738139] be reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_561783] & Regulat ory Management 
(ORERM) as required by 21 CFR 312.32.  These reports are to be filed utilizing the 
University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Adverse Event Reporting Form.  This includes serious, related, labeled (expected) and serious,  related, unlabeled 
(unexpected) adverse experiences.  All other serious adverse ev ents not requiring expedited reporting should be reported to 
MDACC IRB and ORERM within [ADDRESS_738140] ug related. 
 NOTE:  Instructions concerning procedures and reporting for pre gnancies below. 
 
Pregnancies 
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is on lenalidomide or within [ADDRESS_738141]’s last dose of lenalidom ide are consi dered expedited reportable events.  If the 
subject is on lenalidomide, it i s to be discontinued immediately and the subject is to be 
instructed to return any unused portion of lenalidomide to the Investigator.  The 
pregnancy must be reported by [CONTACT_561784] (WWDSS) within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_561785]. 
 The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify 
Celgene Corporation Worldwide Drug Safety Surveillance (WWDSS) of the outcome as 
specified below.  The Investigat or will provide this informatio n as a follow-up to the initial 
SAE. 
 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meet s the criteria for immediat e classification as a SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomal y detected in  an aborted fetus is to 
be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anoma ly), the Investigator 
should follow the procedures f or reporting SAEs (i.e., report t he event to Celgene 
Corporation Worldwide Drug Safet y Surveillance (WWDSS)  by [CONTACT_561786] 24 
hours of the Investigator’s k nowledge of the event) and report the event to MDACC IRB 
and ORERM.  Any suspected fetal exposure to  lenalidomide must be reported t o Celgene, MDACC 
IRB AND ORERM within 24 hours o f being made aware of the event.  The patient 
should be referred to an obstetr ician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity 
for further evaluation and counseling. 
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_738142] 
to causality, as SAEs.  In additi on, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator 
suspects is related to the in utero  exposure to lenalidomide should also be reported. 
In the case of a live “normal” b irth, Celgene Corporation World wide Drug Safety 
Surveillance (WWDSS), MDACC IRB AND ORERM should be advised as soon as the 
information is available.

Investigator Reporting Responsibilities 
The conduct of the study will comply  with all FDA safety report ing requirements.   
Serious Adverse Events Reporting:  The principle investigator h as the obligation to 
report all serious adverse events  to the University of [LOCATION_007] M.  D. Anderson Cancer 
 
 
Center (MDACC) IRB via the Offi ce of Protocol Research and also to Celgene within 24 
hours.  
 IND Annual Reports 
If the FDA has granted an IND num ber, it is a requirement of 21  CFR 312.33, that an 
annual report is provided to the FD A within 60-days of the IND anniversary date.  21 
CRF 312.33 provides the data elem ents that are to be submitted in the report.  The 
Annual Report should be filed with  MD Anderson’s ORERM, who wil l then forward to 
FDA.  An additional copy should be placed in the study's Regula tory Binder and a copy 
must be sent to Celgene Corporat ion as a supporte r of this stud y as follows. 
  Celgene Corporation  Attn: Medical Development  [ADDRESS_738144]  Summit, NJ  [ZIP_CODE]  Tel: ([PHONE_4176]  
All adverse experienc e reports must include the patient number,  age, sex, weight, 
severity of reaction (mild, moderat e, severe), relationship to study drug (probably 
related, unknown relationship, d efinitely not related), date an d time of administration of 
test medications and all concomitant medications, and medical t reatment provided.   
The investigator is re sponsible for evaluat ing all adverse even ts to determine whether 
criteria for “serious” and as defined above are present.  The i nvestigator is responsible 
for reporting adverse events  to Celgene as described below. 
 
Expedited reporting by [INVESTIGATOR_678] [INVESTIGATOR_561774] s (SAE) are defined abov e.  The investigat or should inform 
Celgene of any SAE within [ADDRESS_738145] be completed and supplied to  MDACC IRB, 
ORERM and Celgene within 24 hours/ [ADDRESS_738146] be as complete as possible, including details of the 
current illness and (serious) adv erse event, and an assessment of the causal 
relationship between the event and the investigational product( s).  Information not 
available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or 
laboratory values received afte r the report) must be documented  on a follow-up MD 
Anderson SAE form.  A final report to document resolution of th e SAE is required.  The 
Celgene protocol number (RV-MF-PI-0102) should be included on S AE reports to 
Celgene.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SA E report to Celgene 
should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient rec ords. 
 
 
 
Report of Adverse Events to the Institutional Review Board 
The principal Investigator [CONTACT_832] r equired to notify his/her Instit utional Review B oard (IRB) of 
a serious adverse event accor ding to institutional policy. 
   
Sponsor Reporting to the FDA 
Adverse drug reactions that are Serious, Unlisted/unexpect ed, and at least possibly 
associated to the drug,  and that have not previously been reported in t he Investigator s 
brochure, or reference safety  information document should be reported promptly to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) in writing by [CONTACT_561787]/physician engaged 
in clinical research.  A clear description of the suspected rea ction should be provided 
along with an assessment as to w hether the event is drug or dis ease related.   
 
The sponsor shall notif y the FDA by [CONTACT_561788]. As soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_738147] review division  in the Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research  that has responsibility for r eview of the IND if 
applicable. 
Adverse event updates/IND safety reports Celgene shall notify the Invest igator via an IND Safety Report of the following 
information: 
 
 Any AE associated wi th the use of study drug in this study or in other studies that 
is both serious  and unexpected. 
 Any finding from tests in l aboratory animals that suggests a s ignificant risk for 
human subjects including repor ts of mutagenicity, teratogenicit y, or 
carcinogenicity. 
 
The Investigator shal l notify his/her IRB/EC  promptly of these new serious and 
unexpected AE(s) or signifi cant risks to subjects. 
 
The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_104469], including correspondence with 
Celgene and the IRB/EC, on file. 
 
Protocol amendments 
Any amendment to this protocol mu st be agreed to by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_64800].  Amendments should only be submitted to IRB/EC after 
consideration of Celgene review .  Written verification of IRB/E C approval will be 
obtained before any amend ment is implemented.   
Protocol deviations 
 
 
When an emergency occurs that requi res a deviation from the pro tocol for a subject, a 
deviation will be made only for  that subject.  A decision will be made as soon as 
possible to determine whether o r not the subject (for whom the deviation from protocol 
was effected) is to continue in t he study.  The subject’s medic al records will completely 
describe the deviation from the pr otocol and state the reasons for such deviation.  In 
addition, the Investigator will notify the IRB/EC in writing of  such deviation from protocol. 
 
8.0 Study Monitoring and Auditing 
Investigator responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilities ar e set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in 
the US Code of Federal Regulations. 
Investigators must enter study data into MDACC’s PDMS.  The Inv estigator will permit study-
related monitoring visits and audits by [CONTACT_262515]’s ORERM, Celgene,  or its representatives, IRB/EC 
review, and regulatory inspection(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, TPP), pr oviding direct access to the 
facilities where the study took place, to source documents, to CRFs, and to all other study 
documents. The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at some time 
during monitoring visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to the 
subject’s records (e.g., medical  records, office charts, hospit al charts, and study related charts) for 
source data verification.  The data collection must be complete d prior to each visit and be made 
available to MDACC ORERM and the Celgene representative so that  the accuracy and completeness 
may be checked. 
 
Regulatory Considerations / Institutional Review Board/Ethics C ommittee 
approval 
The protocol for this study has been designed in accordance wit h the general ethical principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The review of this pr otocol by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and the 
performance of all aspects of the study, including the methods used for obtaining informed consent, 
must also be in accordance with p rinciples enunciated in the de claration, as well as ICH Guidelines, 
Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 50 Prot ection of Human Subjects and Part 
56 Institutional Review Boards. 
The Investigator will be responsible for preparing documents fo r submission to the relevant IRB/EC 
and obtaining written approval for this study.  The approval wi ll be obtained prior to the initiation of 
the study. The approval for both the protocol and informed consent must sp ecify the date of approval, protocol 
number and version, or amendment number. 
 
 
Any amendments to the protocol after receipt of IRB/EC approval  must be submitted by [CONTACT_24657]/EC for approval.  The Investigator is a lso responsible for notifying the 
IRB/EC of any serious deviations from the protocol, or anything  else that may involve added risk to 
subjects. 
Any advertisements used to recru it subjects for the study must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_5040]/EC prior to use. 
 
Informed consent 
The Investigator must obtain info rmed consent of a subject or h is/her designee prior to any study 
related procedures as per GCPs as set fort h in the CFR and ICH guidelines. 
Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the subject’s entry into the study and the 
informed consent process should b e recorded in the subject’s so urce documents.  The original 
consent form signed and dated by [CONTACT_271200]’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Inves tigator’s study files. 
 
Study records requirements 
The Investigator must ensure tha t the records and documents per taining to the conduct of the study 
and the distribution of the study drug, that is copi[INVESTIGATOR_121007] (original 
documents, data, and records [e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]; clinical and office charts; laboratory notes; 
memoranda; subject’s diaries or e valuation checklists; pharmacy  dispensing records; recorded data 
from automated instruments; copi[INVESTIGATOR_184612]; microfiches; photographic negatives, microfilm, or magn etic media; x-rays; subject files; and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medic o-technical departments involved in 
the clinical study; documents regarding subject treatment and s tudy drug accountability; original 
signed informed consents, etc.]) be retained by [CONTACT_12244] r for as long as needed to comply with 
national and international regulations (generally [ADDRESS_738148] marketing approval).  The Investigator agrees to  adhere to the document/records 
retention procedures by [CONTACT_12142]. 
Premature discontinuation of study 
 
Single center 
The responsible local clinical Investigator as well as Celgene have the right to discontinue this study 
at any time for reasonable medical or administrative reasons in  any single center.  Possible reasons 
for termination of the study c ould be but are not limited to: 
 Unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality. 
 
 
 Inaccurate or incomplete data collection. 
 Falsification of records. 
 Failure to adhere to the study protocol. 
 
Study as a whole 
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this clinical study at any time for reasonable medical or 
administrative reasons. 
Any possible premature discontinuation would be documented adeq uately with reasons being stated, 
and information would have to be issued according to local requ irements (e.g., IRB/EC, regulatory 
authorities, etc. 
 
 
Patients will be given instruct ions and the M.D . Anderson contact [CONTACT_2300] (principal 
investigator/MD Anderson Leukem ia staff treating physician), phone, and fax 
numbers.  The referring oncologi st will be identified, contacte d, and the protocol 
details discussed. 
All therapy will be given under t he care of MD Anderson Leukemi a staff treating 
physician.  The referring oncologist should contact [CONTACT_561789], and comp lications will be recorded in a  progress note at 
each follow-up visit. 
From past experience, it is rec ognized collaboration with oncol ogist outside MD 
Anderson may occasionally result i n some difficulties such as 1) not performing 
tests as required, 2) not sending results of tests or updates of patient condition, 
3) and not informing on toxiciti es and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Therefore: 1) we will 
discuss with the referring oncologist about the pr otocol and do ses, 2) we will 
make significant efforts (c ontact at least twice and document) to retrieve the 
information (tests, toxicities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), and 3) we wi ll record in a progress 
note all the information on follo w-up visits. Since information may still be missing 
in one or more components in some patients (e.g. missing once CBC), these 
types of difficulties will be co llected and documented as proto col deviations.   
 
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
The primary objective of phase II of this study is to assess efficacy in terms of 
the objective response rate (co mplete and partial response, and  clinical 
improvement) with lenalidomide and prednisone in patients with MF.  The 
MinMax two-stage design proposed by [CONTACT_561790].  Sample size 
and decision criteria are chosen to reduce the expected accrual  if the treatment 
 
 
is ineffective in regard to res ponse relative to having no inte rim stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
The target response rate is 35%.  A response rate of 20% or les s will be 
considered unacceptable and treatm ent with the therapy will be discontinued. 
Given the response rates stated above, if the probability of in appropriately 
accepting a poor therapy is 10%, a  total sample size of 41 patients will result in 
80% power.  
 
In the first stage of the design , a total of [ADDRESS_738149] been enrolled into the study,  if eleven or fewer 
patients respond to the therapy, t he therapy will be declared i neffective.  
However, if greater than 11 patients respond to the therapy, the therapy will be considered efficacious.  The probability of early termination d ue to unacceptable 
response rate is 54%. 
 
Descriptive statistics will be utilized to assess response, time to response, and 
response duration.  Responses w ill be categorized as the best r esponse 
achieved during the course of t he study.  Time to response is defined as the 
time from start of therapy until the response criteria are fulf illed.  Response 
duration will be def ined as the time from response until relaps e (progressive 
disease) or death. 
 The safety analysis will include subjects who are enrolled to t reatment and take 
at least one dose of study medi cation.  Toxicity will be graded  according to the 
NCI criteria.  Descriptive stati stics will be used to describe adverse events 
related to the study drug. Adv erse events will be listed and tabulated. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_738150] es will be obtained pre-therapy, after 6 and 18 
months of therapy. Not all sample s might be obtained at all tim e points. 
Peripheral blood will be collected into 2 specialized CPT 8 mL vacutainer tubes. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMC) will be separated, pe lleted, lysed, 
and stored frozen at –70  C until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Samples w ill be coded so that patient 
confidentiality will be preser ved. They will be shipped on dry ice to the Celgene 
Corporation, San Diego. Contact [CONTACT_561791]: Brydon Bennett, Celg ene, [ADDRESS_738151], San Diego, CA [ZIP_CODE], Phone: [PHONE_11660], Email:

utilizing Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved 
materials. 
4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
4.1. Description of Study Design
This is a two-phase adaptive design. Each pha se will be a multi-site  4-visit bilateral 2x2 
dispensing crossover trial. In Phase I, approximately 65 subjects will be enrolled with a target 
of 60 subjects to complete. After Phase I, an in terim analysis will be  conducted to determine 
the number of subjects that will be enrolled into phase II if the study continues; a maximum of up to 300 additional subjects maybe enrolled.
The subjects enrolled in each phase will be randomized separately.  Whenever possible, the 
same clinical sites w ill be used to enroll subjects thr oughout the entire course of the study. 
Furthermore, both phases will utilize the same crossover design and will be conducted as 
follows: at Visit 1 (Day 0), eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two lens wear sequences (O1D/P1 or P1/O1D). Subjects will be dispensed their first study lens per the 
randomization scheme and will wear the study lenses fo r 6 to 8 days and return for their follow-
up evaluation (Visit 2). Study measurements will be  performed, and subjects will be instructed 
to wear their habitual contact [CONTACT_35494] a period of [ADDRESS_34976] lenses the day of the visit and will be dispensed their second study lens. Subjects will return for their follow-up evaluation and final

visit (visit 4)  [ADDRESS_34977], subjects will undergo a washout period for approxi mately 1-week (6 to 8 days) between study 
lenses. During the washout period subjects will wear either their spectacles or habitual lenses.
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration
During Phase I, approximately [ADDRESS_34978] Article Allocation 
The randomization scheme will be  provided by [CONTACT_35495]. In both phase s, the study randomization will be  stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. Eligible 
subjects will randomly be assi gned to one of two unique lens wear sequences (O1D/P1 or 
P1/O1D) using permuted block randomization in block sizes of 2, to avoid bias in the 
assignment of subjects to treatment, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons 
between treatment groups. The ra ndomization scheme will be generated usi ng the Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS) soft ware Version 9.4 or higher
7 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
CR-6456, v 1.0  
Page 23 of 147JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
The study site will follow the randomization sc heme provided and will complete enrollment 
according to the randomization list and will not pre-select or assign subjects. Randomization 
will be performed at Visit [ADDRESS_34979] occurred prior to
randomization: 
•Informed consent must have been obtained.
•The subject must have met all eligibility criteria.
•The subject’s screening and baseline info rmation must have been collected.
When dispensing test articles, the followi ng steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens
fitting schedule to obtain the test article assignment for that subject prior to dispensing.
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the
lens fitting schedule
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appr opriate test articles from the study supply.
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensedoutside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article AccountabilityLog in the “Dispensed” section.
5.2. Masking
This will be a double-masked trial to reduce potential bias. Subjects will  be unaware of the 
identity of the investigational product. Investigators and clinical site personnel involved in the 
data collection will be masked as to the identity of the investigational product.  
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subj ects have completed 
the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the mask s hould be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of ac tion would be dictated by [CONTACT_35496]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in  an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195]. In 
the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject record. The Investigator 
is also advised not to reveal the study treatment  assignment to the clinical site or Sponsor 
personnel. Subjects who are disc ontinued will not be replaced.
5.3. Procedures for Maintainin g and Breaking the Masking
Every attempt will be made  to keep the clinical trial personnel involved in the study (e.g. data 
management, biostatistician and clinical operations) unaware of the identity of the assigned study lenses.  The identity of the study lenses w ill be masked by [CONTACT_35497] e blister packs labeled 
with the study number, lot number, sphere power, expi[INVESTIGATOR_35440]. 
Only the unmasked biostatistician generating the lens fitting schedule will have access to the decode information that allows matching of the randomization codes to the test articles. The medical monitor will also have access to the decode information in case breaking the mask is necessary for the urgent medi cal treatment of a subject.

Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJVC. 
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles
JJVC will provide the Investigator with suffici ent quantities of study ar ticles and supplies to 
complete the investigation. The I nvestigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation 
for the test article accountability records. 
Test articles must be ke pt in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to  authorized study site 
personnel listed on the Site Dele gation Log. All test articles mu st be accounted. This includes:
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits.
2. What was returned to the Investigator  unused, including expi[INVESTIGATOR_35441].
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements.
The Investigator will collect all unused test article s from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be se parated from the clinical study 
inventory of un-dispensed test articles and must be labeled with the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or monitor will return all unus ed test articles to JJVC.

10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identif ication of a protocol  deviation. Protocol 
deviations must be reported to the sponsor w ithin 24 hours after discovery of the protocol 
deviation. The Investigator will report deviations per IRB/IEC requirements. All deviations 
will be tracked, and corrective actions implemented as appropriate.  
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may implement the deviation immediately without notification to the spons or. Within [ADDRESS_35033] notify and provide the rati onale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB.  
If the deviation potentially impacts the safety of patient or changes the technical integrity of 
the study, then it must be reported to IEC/IRB.   This is a "Major Deviation". Deviations 
that contradict the information contained in the Informed Consent/Assent forms will be considered Major Deviations. 
Minor deviations have no substa ntive effect on patient safety or technical integrity of the 
study.  They are often logistical in nature. Protocol waivers are prohibited. Table 5 lists examples of deviations that will constitute major and minor protocol deviations 
for this study.  
Table 5: Examples of Major a nd Minor Protocol Deviations 
Deviation category Major deviation Minor deviation
Out-of-window visit Visit a ttended more than 2 days

In the case of a major protocol deviation, the decision of whether or not the subject will be 
excluded from the Per-Protocol analysis popul ation will be made at  the time of cohort 
review.
11. STUDY TERMINATION
If more than [ADDRESS_35035] lens group develop serious expected 
(e.g., definite or probable MK) or unexpected de vice related adverse events, the study will be 
suspended. Upon review and c onsultation with IRB, DMC,  and JJVC Safety Review 
committee, the study may be terminated. This potential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35445] [ADDRESS_35036] lens for 
up to 3 years with an assumed MK rate that is  below 0.2% per patient-year. The rate of 0.2% 
per patient year is the established rate for exte nded wear lenses in a dults, which was requested 
by [CONTACT_4760] a criterion for evaluating a contact [CONTACT_35510] 
a pre-IDE submission. To be conservative, 200 i ndependent patient year s were used in the 
calculation. The probability of observing 2 cases or  more incidents of MK is 0.061, and 3 cases 
or more incidents of MK is 0.007 (given an  MK rate of 0.2% per patient year).  
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or any SAE where the relationship to study agen t cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446]. In the even t of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are enrolled. 
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be  stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_35447]’s results are compromised. JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_35511], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unr easonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible. 
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as  required by [CONTACT_35512].

12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use. 
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical  operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints: 
xSubject satisfaction inquiri es reported via “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient
Reported Outcomes (PRO).”
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at theinvestigational site.
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs.
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513],
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations wherethere is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423].
Within [ADDRESS_35037] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not configured to send automatic notificati ons or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of SponsorAwareness).
xWho received the complaint.
xStudy number.
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number).
xLot number(s).
xUnique Subject Identifier(s).
xIndication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject).
xOD/OS indication, along with whet her the lens was inserted.
xAny related AE number if applicable.
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms,resolution of symptoms, etc.).
xEye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable.
xConfirmation of product availa bility for return (and tracking information, if available),
or rationale if product is  not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint

results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel will follo w Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these 
procedures also apply and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be documented.
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.”  
Note : This definition includes events related to  the investigational medical device or the 
comparator, and to the procedures involved. Fo r users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigational medical devices.1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that: 
1. Was not present prior to the study, but a ppeared or reappeared following initiation of
the study.
2. Was present prior to the study but worsen ed during the study. This would include any
condition resulting from concomita nt illnesses, reactions to  concomitant medications,
or progression of disease states.
Note : Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor immedi ately upon learning of the event. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any adverse event that led to any of the following: 
xDeath
xSerious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in any of the following:
xLife-threatening illness or injury
xPermanent or persistent impairment of a body structure or a body function
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_35448]-threatening illness or injury or
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function.

Adverse Device Effect (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.” 
Note 1: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantati on, installation, or opera tion, or any malfunction 
of the investigational medical device.
Note 2: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.[ADDRESS_35039] (UADE) – A UADE is any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test 
article, if that effect, problem,  or death was not previously id entified in nature , severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include: 
xSeriousness/Classifications (s ee definition in Section 13.1).
xCausality or Rela tedness – i.e. the relationship betw een the test artic le, study treatment
or study procedures and the adverse even t (not related, unlikely related, possibly
related, or related - see definition in Section 13.2.1).
xAdverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree ofintensity of the adverse event (mild, moderate, or severe - see definition in Section13.2.2).
xOutcome – not recovered or not resolve d, recovering or resolving, recovered or
resolved with sequelae, recovered or resolved, death related to adverse event, orunknown.
xActions Taken – none, tempor arily discontinued, permanen tly discontinued, or other.
13.2.1. Causality Assessment
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]: 
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study
treatment or study procedures.
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more
likely, e.g. concomitant treatme nt, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely.
xPossibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explan ation, e.g. concomitant
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time isreasonable. Therefore, the causa l relationship cannot be excluded.
CR-6456, v 1.0  
Page 51 of 147JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g.
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very
suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge.
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be eval uated according to the following scale: 
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interferewith the subject’s daily activities.
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additional therapy, and may
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapyand interferes with the subject’s daily activities.
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test  article, start of st udy treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the c ondition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be recorded as adverse ev ents at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs and complete the Adverse Event eCRF.   
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. All adverse events occurring while the subject  is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardle ss of relationship.   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following: 
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom).
xDrawings or photographs (where approp riate) that detail the finding (e.g., size,
location, and depth, etc.).
xDate the clinical site was notified.
xDate and time of onset.
xDate and time of resolution.
xAdverse event classification, se verity, and relationship to te st articles, as applicable.
CR-6456, v 1.0  
Page 52 of 147JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xTreatment regimen instituted (where appropriate), including concomitant medications
prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements.
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed.
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any).
xLikely etiology.
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the ev ent and upon conclusion of the
event, if the AE is related to the visual system.
Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related’ or ‘related’ to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visu al system or not),  an AE review form 
must be completed. Additiona l dated and initialed entries should be made at follow-up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she  will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allo w an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the assessment of relationship to the Test Ar ticle shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event sh all be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatme nt beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider. The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be  the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Inves tigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse events related to the test artic le, study treatment or study procedur es, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolu tion of the adverse event or un til referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse events that are not related to the test artic le, study treatment, or study proce dures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for an y serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to 
their requirements (Section 13.4.2) . The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedures.

13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of a ll serious/significant adve rse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e- mail or telephone, but no  later than [ADDRESS_35040] igator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/si gnificant adverse event must be followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported. 
When medically necessary, the Investigator ma y break the randomizati on code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unm asking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must: 
xNotify the Sponsor immediately.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information andmedical judgment for colleague s who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the
subject.
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article.
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_35520] C/IRB reporting procedure according to
national regulations.
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_35041] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_35042]. 
Non-Serious Adverse EventsAll non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Resp onsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site wi ll refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582]. 
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events  to the local health authorities according the

fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_19583], but due to 
general concerns relating to pre gnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Sp ecifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual  acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be  implemented in this c linical trial is outlined 
below. More details will be included in the stand-alone Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The 
SAP will be developed and finalized prior to database lock.
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) software Version 9.4 or higher7(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Throughout the 
analysis of data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and statistical analysis. Unscheduled visits will be summarized separately and will be excluded from the statistical analysis.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variab les as appropriate. Con tinuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or  eyes within each category will 
be provided for categorical data.
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_35523] (O1D (Test) and P1 
(Control)) and will be performed separately by [CONTACT_19587] (S afety Population, Per-
Protocol Population and Intent-to-Treat Population, when appropriate). 
The interim analysis will be performed on th e Per-Protocol population w hile the primary and 
secondary analyses for phase II will be perfo rmed on the Intent-to- Treat Population (see 
Section 14.3 for additional details).
14.2. Sample Size Justification
Phase I of this study was not powered to test non- inferiority of O1D relative to P1 with respect 
to the primary endpoints. However, data collect ed during Phase I of the study will be used to
power Phase II to test for superiority of the O1D relative to P1 with respect to Overall comfort ,
CR-6456, v 1.0

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
Comfort at the End of the Day  and Dryness at the End of the Day . Based on these results from 
testing for non-inferiority for each primary end point from the interim analysis (Phase I 
analysis), the sample size will be calculated to test all three primary hypotheses for superiority 
with at least 80% power. This will be calculate d using an approximation of the power of an F-
test derived from the non-centrality parameter calculated from the observed F-statistic from 
the generalized linear model desc ribed in Section 14.5 for Phase I.9  If the sample size 
calculation for Phase II exceeds 300 then then the Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study. Alpha will be adjusted as described in S ection 14.4. Complete details  of the sample size 
calculation for Phase II are described in Section 14.5.
14.3. Analysis Populations 
Safety Population: 
All subjects who were administered any test ar ticle excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should be recorded. 
Per-Protocol Population:  
All subjects who have successfully  completed all study visits and did not substantially deviate 
from the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_35524] (Per-Protocol Population). Ju stification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in 
the Per-Protocol Population set will be  documented in a memo to file.
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:All randomized subjects regardless of actual treat ment or deviation from protocol. At least one 
observation should be recorded. 
14.4. Level of Statis tical Significance
All type I error adjustments utilized in this study were calculated using a Bonferroni
10
correction.  
Primary hypotheses in Phase I will be tested using a familywise type I error rate of 5%; each 
hypothesis with be tested using an i ndividual type I error rate of 1.67%.  
Hypotheses in Phase II will be test ed using the following strategy:  
Primary hypotheses will be tested using a familywise type I error rate of 5%; each hypothesis 
with be tested using an individual type I erro r rate of 1.67%.  All pr imary hypotheses must be 
met in order to test any s econdary hypotheses. Secondary hypot heses were grouped according 
to item sematic simila rities. Each secondary hypothesis gr oup will be tested using an overall 
type I error rate of 5% and in a sequential or der. Each preceding secondary hypothesis group 
must be fully met in order to continue testing the remaining secondary hypotheses. Exploratory 
hypotheses will only be tested if all primary and secondary  group 2 hypotheses are met.

Subjective responses to each primary endpoint will be grouped as: aval=[ADDRESS_35043] responds’ 
‘Excellent’ or ‘Very Good’, aval=[ADDRESS_35044] responds’ ‘Good’ and aval=[ADDRESS_35045] 
responds’ ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’.  Aval will be analyzed  separately for each primary endpoint using 
a generalized linear model with a multinomial distribution and the general logit as the link function. In each model, sequence of lens wear, period, lens type  and site id will be included 
as fixed effects. Prior to fitting the final models for the primary endpoints, allocation of 
subjects’ completion between sites will be evaluated. If a difference of more than 30% is observed between sites, a lik elihood ratio test for homogeneous  variance will be conducted 
using a generalized linear mixed model with a multinomial distribution and the general logit as the link function. Comparisons between O1D and P1 will be carried out under the final 
model using 1-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (C Is) constructed for the odds ratio (O1D over 
P1).  
The Model:

Hypothesis Testing 
Hypothesis testing will be c onducted separately for each primary endpoint as follows: 
+R25
Ha: OR > 0.67 
Where, the OR represents the odds of having a more positive experience (Excellent or Very 
Good) while wearing O1D compared to P1. Non- inferiority of O1D relative to P1 will be 
concluded if the lower limit of the 97.5% CI  is above 0.67 (using 10% as non-inferiority margin and assuming a reference proportion of 0.5) .

Sample size Estimation for Phase II
If non-inferiority is demonstrated for the primary  endpoints, the sample size required to test 
superiority for each primary endpoint will be estimated. The odds ratio and the cumulative log-
odds from the model described above for each en dpoint will be used to create a new dataset 
with the same structure and design as Phase I. This new dataset will then be analyzed using the 
same model. The statistical power  of each endpoint will be calcu lated using the F-statistics as 
Power=P(F[Fcrit, v, ncp] > Fcrit); where Fcrit is the critical value of the central F distribution
(Fcrit=ܨ[௡௨௠ௗ௙ ,ௗ௠ௗ௙ ,଴,௔௟௣௛௔ ]) under Ho (Ho: centrality param = 0), v is the magnitude of the 
departure from Ho and ncp is th e non-centrality parameter (Stroup).9
Phase II
Overall comfort, Comfort at the end of the day, and Dryness at the end of the day 
Subjective responses to each primary endpoint will be grouped as: aval=[ADDRESS_35050] responds’ ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very Good’, aval=[ADDRESS_35051] responds’ ‘Good’ and aval=[ADDRESS_35052] 
responds’ ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’.  Aval will be analyzed  separately for each primary endpoint using 
a generalized linear mixed model with a multinomial distribution and the cumulative logit as the link function. In each model, sequence of lens  wear, period and lens type will be included 
as fixed effects. Site and subject nested within site will be included as a random effect. Errors between measurements within the same subject  across study periods will be modeled using an 
unstructured covariance (UN) structure. Comparisons between O1D and P1 will be carried out using 1-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (CIs) co nstructed for the odds ratio (O1D over P1). 
Superiority of O1D relative to P1  will be concluded if the lowe r limit of the 97.5% CI is above 
1.
14.6. Secondary Analysis 
All secondary items will be analyzed individua lly regardless of groupi [INVESTIGATOR_35452] y endpoints in Phase II above. Comparisons 
between O1D and P1 will be carried out us ing 1-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (CIs) 
constructed for the odds ratio (O1D over P1). For Secondary Group 1 – Comfort Performance 
and Secondary Group 2- Digital Device Performance, superiority of O1D relative to P1 will 
be concluded if the lower limit of the 97.5% CI is above 1.  For Secondary Group 3 – 
Performance at Lens Fitting and Secondary Group 4- Lens Handling Performance, non-inferiority of O1D relative to P1 will be concluded if the lowe r limit of the 97.5% CI  is above 
0.67 (using 10% as non-inferiority margin a nd assuming a reference proportion of 0.5) . 
Note. Aval will be derived as follows for Secondary Group 3 – Performance at Lens Fitting; aval=[ADDRESS_35053] responds’ ‘Strongly Agree’ or ‘Agree’, aval=[ADDRESS_35054] responds’ ‘Neither Agree Nor Disagree’ and aval=[ADDRESS_35055] responds’ ‘S trongly Disagree’ or 
‘Disagree’)  
14.7. Other Exploratory Analysis 
Digital Device Performance by [CONTACT_35525] w ill be grouped as: aval=[ADDRESS_35056] responds’ 
‘Excellent’ or ‘Very Good’, aval=[ADDRESS_35057] responds’ ‘Good’ and aval=[ADDRESS_35058]

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
responds’ ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’.  Amount of digital device use is collected by [CONTACT_6270]-report at the 
follow-up visit: the subject is asked their averag e number of hours of digital device use on the 
days between visits that they wore the study lenses. Subjects with digital device use below the 
50thpercentile of the distribution of digital device use for all subjects in the study will be 
classified as grp1 (lower digita l device usage), and subjects with  digital device use above the 
50thpercentile will be classified as grp2 (higher digital device usage). Digital device items will 
be analyzed separately using a generalized linear mixed model with a multinomial distribution 
and the cumulative logit as the link function. Seque nce of lens wear, period, lens type, group 
(grp 1 and grp 2) and the interaction between lens type and group will be included in each 
model as fixed effects. Site and subject nested within site will be included as a random effect. Errors between measurements within the same  subject across study periods will be modeled 
using an unstructured covariance (UN) structure. Comparisons between O1D and P1 will be carried for each group separately (grp 1 an d grp 2) out using 1-sided 97.5% confidence 
intervals (CIs) constructed for the odds ratio (O1D over P1). Non-inferiority of O1D relative to P1 will be concluded if the lower limit of the 97.5% CI  is above 0.67 (using 10% as non-
inferiority margin and assuming a reference proportion of 0.5) .  
14.8. Interim Analysis 
This is a two-phase adaptive approach utilizing stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. Approximately [ADDRESS_35059] 80% power. Howe ver, maximum enrollment for Phase II can 
be no more than 300 subjects (based on resource s and study timing). After reviewing the results 
from the interim analysis, the study may be stopped prior to beginning enrollment for Phase II for one of the following reasons:  
1. Lack of efficacy with respect to pr imary endpoints (results  are inconclusive)
2. Required sample size too large to achieve primary endpoints
Full details regarding the planned interim analysis are located in Section 14.[ADDRESS_35060] clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not-at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data , sensitivity analysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropout is greater than the 10%. The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MI ANALYZE will be utilized with a parametric 
regression method used to ma ke at least 50 imputations.

nology for ASTIGMATISM are indicated for daily disposable wear for the 
optical correction of refractive ametropia (myopia and hyperopia) in phakic 
or aphakic persons with non-diseased eyes who may have 0.50D to 3.00D of astigmatism.
These lenses contain a UV Blocker to help protect against transmission of 
harmful UV radiation to the cornea and into the eye.
CONTRAINDICATIONS (REASONS NOT TO USE) 
DO NOT USE these contact [CONTACT_35542]:
• Acute or subacute inﬂ  ammation or infection of the anterior chamber
of the eye.
• Any eye disease, injury or abnormality that affects the cornea,
conjunctiva, or eyelids.
• Severe insufﬁ  ciency of lacrimal secretion (dry eye).
CR-  
Page 80 of 147JJVC
• Corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity).
• Any systemic disease that may affect the eye or be exaggerated by
[CONTACT_35543].
• Allergic reactions of ocular surfaces or adnexa that may be induced
or exaggerated by [CONTACT_35544].
• Ocular irritation due to allergic reactions which may be caused by
[CONTACT_35545] (i.e., rewetting drops) that containchemicals or preservatives (such as mercury, Thimerosal, etc.) towhich some people may develop an allergic response.
• Any active corneal infection (bacterial, fungal, protozoal, or viral).
• If eyes become red or irritated.
WARNINGS
Patients should be advised of the following warnings pertaining to 
contact [CONTACT_13279]:
EYE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING CORNEAL ULCERS, CAN DEVELOP 
RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_35458]; IF THE PATIENT EXPE-RIENCES:
• Eye Discomfort,
• Excessive Tearing,• Vision Changes,• Loss of Vision,• Eye Redness,• Or Other Eye Problems,
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY RE-
MOVE THE LENSES AND PROMPTLY CONTACT [CONTACT_35546].
• When prescribed for daily wear, patients should be instructed not
to wear lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Clinical studies have shown that
the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when lenses areworn overnight, and that lcerative keratitis is greater for
CR-
Page [ADDRESS_35068] lens users than for daily wear users.3
• Studies have shown that contact [CONTACT_35547] a higher incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers.
• Problems with contact [CONTACT_35548]. Patients should be cautioned that proper
use and care of contact [CONTACT_35549].
• The overall risk of ulcerative keratitis may be reduced by [CONTACT_35550].

Speciﬁ  c Instructions for Use and Warnings:
• Water Activity
Instructions for Use
Do not expose contact [CONTACT_35551].WARNING:
Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe infection,vision loss or blindness. If lenses have been submersed in waterwhen participating in water sports or swimming in pools, hot tubs,lakes, or oceans, the patient should be instructed to discard themand replace them with a new pair. The Eye Care Professional shouldbe consulted for recommendations regarding wearing lenses duringany activity involving water.
PRECAUTIONS
Special Precautions for Eye Care Professionals:
• Due to the small number of patients enrolled in clinical investiga-
tion of lenses, all refractive powers, design conﬁ  gurations, or lensparameters available in the lens material are not evaluated in signif-icant numbers. Consequently, when selecting an appropriate lensdesign and parameters, the Eye Care Professional should considerall characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance andocular health, including oxygen permeability, wettability, central andperipheral thickness, and optic zone diameter.
CR-  
Page 82 of 147JJVC
• The potential impact of these factors on the patient’s ocular health
should be carefully weighed against the patient’s need for refractive
correction; therefore, the continuing ocular health of the patient andlens performance on the eye should be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_35552].
• Patients who wear these lenses to correct presby[CONTACT_35553]-
vision may not achieve the best corrected visual acuity for eitherfar or near vision. Visual requirements vary with the individual andshould be considered when selecting the most appropriate type oflens for each patient.
• Fluorescein, a yellow dye, should not be used while the lenses are
on the eyes. The lenses absorb this dye and become discolored.Whenever ﬂ  uorescein is used in eyes, the eyes should be ﬂ  ushedwith a sterile saline solution that is recommended for in-eye use.
• Eye Care Professionals should instruct the patient to remove the
lenses immediately if the eyes become red or irritated.
Eye Care Professionals should carefully instruct patients about the following care regimen and safety precautions.
Handling Precautions:
• Before leaving the Eye Care Professional’s ofﬁ  ce, the patient should
be able to promptly remove the lenses or should have someone
else available who can remove the lenses for him or her.
• DO NOT use if the sterile blister package is opened or damaged.
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get
cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the
eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting onmakeup. Water-based cosmetics are less likely to damage lensesthan oil-based products.
• DO NOT touch contact [CONTACT_35554] ﬁ  ngers or hands if the
hands are not free of foreign materials, as microscopic scratchesof the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury tothe eye.
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing
instructions in the “Patien  Guide” for the prescribed
CR-  
Page 83 of 147JJVC
wearing schedule and those prescribed by [CONTACT_35555].
• Always handle lenses carefully and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459].
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens
container unless speciﬁ  cally indicated for that use. Slide the lens up
the side of the bowl until it is free of the container.
• Do not touch the lens with ﬁ  ngernails.
Lens Wearing Precautions:
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recom-
mended directions in “Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens." Thelens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of theeye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the patient should beinstructed to immediately consult his or her Eye Care Professional.
• Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_35556].
• The patient should be advised to never allow anyone else to wear
their lenses. They have been prescribed to ﬁ  t their eyes and tocorrect their vision to the degree necessary. Sharing lenses greatlyincreases the chance of eye infections.
• If aerosol products, such as hair spray, are used while wearing
lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray hassettled.
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing
lenses.
• Always discard lenses worn as prescribed by [CONTACT_35557].
Lens Care Precautions: 
• The patient should be informed that no cleaning or disinfection is
needed when lenses are worn for daily disposable wear.  Patientsshould always dispose of lenses when removed and have sparelenses or spectacles available.
CR-  
Page 84 of 147JJVC
Other Topi[INVESTIGATOR_35460]:
• Always contact [CONTACT_35558]-
cine in the eyes.
• Certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants,
diuretics, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, and those for motion
sickness may cause dryness of the eye, increased lens awareness,or blurred vision. Should such conditions exist, proper remedialmeasures should be prescribed. Depending on the severity, thiscould include the use of lubricating drops that are indicated for usewith soft contact [CONTACT_35559].
• Oral contraceptive users could develop visual changes or changes
in lens tolerance when using contact [CONTACT_13276]. Patients should becautioned accordingly.
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow-up visits are necessary to assure
the continuing health of the patient’s eyes. The patient should beinstructed as to a recommended follow-up schedule.
Who Should Know That the Patient is Wearing Contact [CONTACT_32993]?
• Patients should inform all doctors (Health Care Professionals) about
being a contact [CONTACT_35560].
• Patients should always inform their employer of being a contact
[CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may require use of eye protection equip-ment or may require that the patient not wear contact [CONTACT_13276].
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The patient should be informed that the following problems may occur when wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]:
• The eye may burn, sting, and/or itch.
• There may be less comfort than when the lens was ﬁ  rst placed on
the eye.
• There may be a feeling of something in the eye (foreign body,
scratched area).
• There may be the potent l  temporary impairment due to
CR-  
Page 85 of 147JJVC
peripheral inﬁ  ltrates, peripheral corneal ulcers, or corneal erosion. 
There may be the potential for other physiological observations, such as local or generalized edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, injection, tarsal abnormalities, iritis, and conjuncti-vitis; some of which are clinically acceptable in low amounts.
• There may be excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or
redness of the eye.
• Poor visual acuity, blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around
objects, photophobia, or dry eyes may also occur if the lenses areworn continuously or for too long a time.
The patient should be instructed to conduct a simple 3-part self-examina-tion at least once a day. They should ask themselves:
• How do the lenses feel on my eyes?
• How do my eyes look?• Have I noticed a change in my vision?
If the patient reports any problems, he or she should be instructed to 
IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS. If the problem or discomfort stops, the patient should discard the lens and place a new fresh lens on the eye.
If after inserting the new lens, the problem continues, the patient should be 
directed to IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS AND CONTACT [CONTACT_35561].
The patient should be instructed NOT to use a new lens as self-treatment 
for the problem.
The patient should be advised that when any of the above symptoms oc-
cur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, neovascularization, or iritis may be present. He or she should be instructed to seek immediate professional identiﬁ  cation of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.

GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES
A. Patient Selection
Patients selected to wear these lenses should be chosen based on: 
• Motivation to wear lenses
• Ability to follow instructions regarding lens wear care
• General health
• Ability to adequately handle and care for the lenses
• Ability to understand the risk and beneﬁ  ts of lens wear
Patients who do not meet the above criteria should not be provided with 
contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
B. Pre-ﬁ  tting Examination
Initial evaluation of the patient should begin with a thorough case history 
to determine if there are any contraindications to contact [CONTACT_13279]. During 
the case history, the patient’s visual needs and expectations should be 
determined as well as an assessment of their overall ocular, physical, and 
mental health. 
Preceding the initial selection of trial contact [CONTACT_13276], a comprehensive 
ocular evaluation should be performed that includes, but is not limited to, 
the measurement of distance and near visual acuity, distance and near 
refractive prescription (including determining the preferred reading distance
for presby[CONTACT_35562]), keratometry, and biomicroscopic evaluation. 
Based on this evaluation, if it is determined that the patient is eligible to 
wear these lenses, the Eye Care Professional should proceed to the lens 
ﬁ  tting instructions as outlined below. 
C. Initial Power Determination
A spectacle refraction should be performed to establish the patient’s 
baseline refractive status and to guide in the selection of the appropriate 
lens power. Remember to compensate for vertex distance if the refraction 
is greater than ±4.00D.
D. Base Curve Selection (Trial Lens Fitting)
The following trial lenses should be selected for patients regardless of kera-
tometry readings. However re measurements should be 
performed to establish the lar status. CR- ) 
Page 87 of 147JJVC
• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day for ASTIGMATISM: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
The trial lens should be placed on each of the patient's eyes and evaluated 
after the patient has adjusted to the lenses.  
1. Criteria of a Properly Fit Lens
A properly ﬁ  t lens will center and completely cover the cornea (i.e., nolimbal exposure), have sufﬁ  cient movement to provide tear exchangeunder the contact [CONTACT_35563], and be comfortable. The lensshould move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, andthen return to its properly centered position when released.
2. Criteria of a Flat Fitting Lens
A ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following characteris-tics: decentration, incomplete corneal coverage (i.e., limbal exposure),excessive movement with the blink, and/or edge standoff. If the lens isjudged to be ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
3. Criteria of a Steep Fitting Lens
A steep ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following charac-teristics: insufﬁ  cient movement with the blink, conjunctival indentation,and resistance when pushing the lens up digitally with the lower lid.If the lens is judged to be steep ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed tothe patient.
If the initial trial base curve is judged to be ﬂ  at or steep ﬁ  tting, the alternate base curve, if available, should be trial ﬁ  t and evaluated after the patient has adjusted to the lens. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to a properly centered position when released. If resistance is encountered when pushing the lens up, the lens is ﬁ  tting tightly and should not be dispensed to the patient.
E. Final Lens Power (Spherical)
A spherical over-refraction should be performed to determine the ﬁ  nal lenspower after the lens ﬁ  t is judged acceptable. The spherical over-refractionshould be combined with the trial lens power to determine the ﬁ  nal lensprescription. The patient should experience good visual acuity with thecorrect lens power unless there e residual astigmatism.
CR-  
Page 88 of 147JJVC
Example 1
Diagnostic lens: -2.00DSpherical over-refraction: -0.25D
Final lens power: -2.25D
Example 2
Diagnostic lens: -2.00DSpherical over-refraction: +0.25D
Final lens power: -1.75D
If vision is acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess adequate 
ﬁ  t (centration and movement). If the ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses and instruct the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see dispensing and follow up information in PATIENT MANAGEMENT).
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT 
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
TORIC FITTING GUIDELINES
Although most aspects of the ﬁ  tting procedure are identical for all types 
of soft contact [CONTACT_13276], including toric lenses, there are some additional steps and/or rules to follow to assure the proper ﬁ  t of toric lenses.
The only new steps you must follow in prescribing ACUVUE
 OASYS® 
1-Day for ASTIGMATISM are that you must determine the stability,
repeatability, and drift angle of the lens axis so that you can prescribe thecorrect lens axis for the patient.
A. How to Determine Lens Cylinder and Axis Orientation
1. Locate the Orientation Marks
To help determine the proper orientation of the toric lens, you’ll
ﬁ  nd two primary marks approximately 1 mm from the lens edgerepresenting the vertical position on opposite ends of the lens at6 and 12 o’clock (Fig. 1). Because of the lens’ ballasting system,either mark can represent the vertical position – there is no “top”and “bottom” as in a prism-ballasted lens. You don’t need to viewboth marks to assess orientation; simply look for the 6 o’clockmark as you would with a prism-ballasted lens.

You’ll need a slit lamp biomicroscope with a 1 to 2 mm 
parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35462] ﬁ  tted to the eye. There are a number of techniques you can use to improve the visibility of the 6 o’clock mark. Using a parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35463]ﬁ  cation (10x or 15x), slowly pan down the lens, looking just below the direct illumination at the retroilluminated area. Backlighting the mark this way should make it more visible. Sometimes manipulating the lower lid may be necessary to uncover the mark.
2. Observe Lens Rotation and Stability
Observe the position and stability of the “bottom” mark. It usuallystabilizes at the 6 o’clock position. If it does, calculation of thelens power will be straightforward. The 6 o’clock position is not a“must”; however, the absolute requirement is that the axis positionbe stable and repeatable.
The mark may stabilize somewhat left or right (drift) of the vertical
meridian and still enable you to ﬁ  t a toric lens for that eye, aslong as the lens always returns to the same “drift axis” positionafter settling. The deviation can be compensated for in the ﬁ  nalprescription. Your objective is to ensure that whatever position theinitial lens assumes near 6 o’clock, this position must be stableand repeatable. With full eye movement or heavy blink, you maysee the marks swing away, but they must return quickly to theoriginal stable position. If the lens does not return quickly, you mayneed to select a different lens.
3. Assessing Rotation
Imagine the eye as a clock dial and every hour represents a30° interval. If the orientation mark of the initial lens stabilizessomewhat left or right of the vertical position, the ﬁ  nal lens willorient on the eye with the same deviation. You can use an axisreticule in the slit lamp or use a line-scribed lens in a spectacle trialframe to measure or estimate the “drift angle” of the cylinder axis.
To compensate for this “drift”, measure or estimate the “drift”, then
add or subtract it from the refractive axis to determine the correctcylinder axis. Use the LARS (Left Add, Right Subtract) method todetermine which direction to compensate.

B. Final Lens Power
When the diagnostic lens has its axis aligned in the same meridian
as the patient’s refractive axis, a spherocylindrical over-refraction maybe performed and visual acuity determined. However, in the caseof crossed axes, such as when the diagnostic lens axis is differentfrom the spectacle cylinder axis, it is not advisable to perform a fullspherocylindrical over-refraction because of the difﬁ  culty in computingthe resultant power. A spherical over-refraction without cylinderrefraction may be performed.
If the required cylinder correction falls between two available cylinder
powers, it is recommended to prescribe the lower cylinder powerlens. See below for instructions on how to determine the ﬁ  nal lenspower.
1. For the Sphere
If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx > ±4.00D,
compensate for vertex distance. If sphere alone or combinedsphere and cylinder Rx ≤ ±4.00D, vertex compensation is notnecessary.
2. For the Cylinder
Adjust the axis by [CONTACT_35564]. Choosea cylinder that is ≤ 0.50D from the refractive cylinder.
3. Case Examples
Example [ADDRESS_35069] (spectacle) refraction:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180° 20/20O.S. -2.00D / -1.00D x 180° 20/20
Choose a diagnostic lens for each eye with axis 180°. Place 
the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient’s initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Check the orientation of the axis mark. If the bottom axis mark 
is in the 6 o’clock position on both eyes, choose the appropriate cylinder as listed previously. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180°O.S. -2.00D / -0.75D x 180°
CR-  
Page [ADDRESS_35070] (spectacle) refraction:O.D. -3.00D / -1.00D x 90° 20/20O.S. -4.75D / -2.00D x 90° 20/20
Choose diagnostic lenses of -3.00D / -0.75D x 90° for the right 
eye and -4.50D / -1.75D x 90° for the left eye, the nearest lenses available to the spherical power, cylinder power, and axis needed. For the left eye, since the manifest refraction called for -4.75D, compensating for vertex distance the sphere is reduced by 0.25D to -4.50D. The cylinder power will be -1.75D. Place the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient's initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable. 
Right Eye
The orientation mark on the right lens rotates left from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. Compensation for this rotation should be done as follows: 
Compensate the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35565].
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -3.00D / -0.75D x 100°
Left Eye
The orientation mark on the left lens rotates right from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. 
Compensate for the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35566]. 
Here is the Rx Prescribed: 
O.S. -4.50D / -1.75D x 80°
If vision is acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess 
adequate ﬁ  t (centration and movement). If ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses instructing the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see dispensing and follow-up information in PATIENT MANAGEMENT).
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
CR-  
Page [ADDRESS_35071] adequately
corrected distance and near visual acuity in each eye. Theamblyopic patient or the patient with signiﬁ  cant astigmatism(greater than 1.00D) in one eye may not be a good candidate formonovision correction with these lenses.
Occupational and environmental visual demands should be
considered. If the patient requires critical vision (visual acuity andstereopsis), it should be determined by [CONTACT_35567]. Monovisioncontact [CONTACT_35568]:
• visually demanding situations such as operating potentially
dangerous machinery or performing other potentially hazardous
activities; and
• driving automobiles (e.g., driving at night). Patients who cannot
meet state driver's licensing requirements with monovisioncorrection should be advised to not drive with this correction,OR may require that additional over-correction be prescribed.
2. Patient Education
All patients do not function equally well with monovision correc-tion. Patients may not perform as well for certain tasks with thiscorrection as they have with spectacles (multifocal, bifocal, trifocal,readers, progressives). Each patient should understand thatmonovision, as well as other presby[CONTACT_35569], can createa vision compromise that may reduce visual acuity and depthperception for distance and near tasks. Therefore, caution shouldbe exercised when the patient is wearing the correction for the ﬁ  rsttime until they are familiar with the vision provided in visually chal-lenging environments (e.g., reading a menu in a dim restaurant,driving at night in rainy/foggy conditions, etc.). During the ﬁ  ttingprocess, it is necessary for the patient to realize the disadvantagesas well as the advantages of clear near vision and straight aheadand upward gaze that monovision contact [CONTACT_35570].
CR-  
Page 93 of 147JJVC
B. Eye Selection
1. Ocular Preference Determination Methods
Generally, the non-dominant eye is corrected for near vision. The
following two methods for eye dominance can be used.
Method 1:  Determine which eye is the “sighting eye.” Have the
patient point to an object at the far end of the room. 
Cover one eye. If the patient is still pointing directly at the object, the eye being used is the dominant (sighting) eye.
Method 2:  Determine which eye will accept the added power with 
the least reduction in vision. Place a hand-held trial lens equal to the spectacle near ADD in front of one eye and then the other while the distance refractive error correction is in place for both eyes. Determine whether the patient functions best with the near ADD lens over the right or left eye.
2. Other Eye Selection Methods
Other methods include the "Refractive Error Method" and the"Visual Demands Method."
Refractive Error MethodFor anisometropic correction, it is generally best to ﬁ  t the more
hyperopic (less myopic) eye for distance and the more myopic(less hyperopic) eye for near.
Visual Demands Method
Consider the patient’s occupation during the eye selection process 
to determine the critical vision requirements. If a patient’s gaze for near tasks is usually in one direction, correct the eye on that side for near.
Example: A secretary who places copy to the left side of the desk 
will function best with the near lens on the left eye.
C. Special Fitting Characteristics
1. Unilateral Vision Correction
There are circumstances where only one contact [CONTACT_35571].As an example, an emmetropic patient would only require a nearlens, whereas a bilateral uld require corrective lenses on
CR-  
Page 94 of 147JJVC
both eyes.
Examples: A presby[CONTACT_35572] a +1.75D ADD 
would have a +1.75D lens on the near eye and the other eye left without correction. 
A presby[CONTACT_35573] a +1.50D ADD who is -2.50D 
myopic in the right eye and -1.50D myopic in the left eye may have the right eye corrected for distance and the left uncorrected for near.
2. Near ADD Determination
Always prescribe the lens power for the near eye that providesoptimal near acuity at the midpoint of the patient’s habitual readingdistance. However, when more than one power provides optimalreading performance, prescribe the least plus (most minus) of thepowers.
3. Trial Lens Fitting
A trial ﬁ  tting is performed in the ofﬁ  ce to allow the patient toexperience monovision correction. Lenses are ﬁ  t according tothe GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES for base curve selectiondescribed in this Package Insert.
Case history and standard clinical evaluation procedure should
be used to determine the prognosis. Determine the distancecorrection and the near correction. Next determine the near ADD.With trial lenses of the proper power in place, observe the reactionto this mode of correction.
Allow the lenses to settle for about [ADDRESS_35072] the patientlook at you. Assess the patient’s reaction to distance vision underthese circumstances. Then have the patient look at familiar nearobjects such as a watch face or ﬁ  ngernails. Again assess thereaction. As the patient continues to look around the room at bothnear and distance objects, observe the reactions. Only after thesevision tests are completed should the patient be asked to readprint. Evaluate the patient’s reaction to large print (e.g., typewrittencopy) at ﬁ  rst and then graduate to newsprint and ﬁ  nally smallertype sizes.
After the patient’s performance under the above conditions
is completed, tests of vis and reading ability under
CR-  
Page [ADDRESS_35073] several weeks of wear (when adaptation is occurring), itmay be advisable for the patient to only drive during optimal drivingconditions. After adaptation and success with these activities, thepatient should be able to drive under other conditions with caution.
D. Other Suggestions
The success of the monovision technique may be further improved by[CONTACT_35574]:
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (distance power) to use when critical
distance viewing is needed.
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (near power) to use when critical near
viewing is needed.
• Having supplemental spectacles to wear over the monovision
contact [CONTACT_35575]ﬁ  c visual tasks may improve the successof monovision correction. This is particularly applicable for thosepatients who cannot meet state driver's licensing requirementswith monovision correction.
• Make use of proper illumination when carrying out visual tasks.
CR-  
Page 96 of 147JJVC
Monovision ﬁ  tting success can be improved by [CONTACT_35576]:
• Reverse the distance and near eyes if a patient is having trouble
adapting.
• Reﬁ  ne the lens powers if there is trouble with adaptation.
Accurate lens power is critical for presby[CONTACT_35577].
• Emphasize the beneﬁ  ts of clear near vision and straight ahead
and upward gaze with monovision.
The decision to ﬁ  t a patient with monovision correction is most appropriately left to the Eye Care Professional in conjunction with the patient after carefully considering the patient’s needs.

INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
PATIENT MANAGEMENT
Dispensing Visit
Each sterile lens is supplied in a foil-sealed plastic package containing 
buffered saline solution with methyl ether cellulose. To remove the lens from the container, peel back the foil seal, place a ﬁ  nger on the lens, and slide the lens up the side of the bowl of the lens package until it is free of the container.
•Evaluate the physical ﬁ  t and visual acuity of the lens on each eye.
•Teach the patient how to apply and remove his or her lenses.
•Explain daily disposable lens wear and schedule a follow-upexamination.
• Provide the patient with a copy of the PATIENT
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35464].acuvue.com.
REVIEW THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE PATIENT SO THAT HE
OR SHE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE PRESCRIBED WEARINGAND REPLACEMENT SCHEDULES.
Follow-Up Examinations
Follow-up care (necessary to ensure continued successful contact [CONTACT_13279]) should include routine periodic progress examinations, management of speciﬁ  c problems, if any, and a review with the patient of the wear schedule, daily disposable moda per lens handling procedures.
CR-  
Page 97 of 147JJVC
Recommended Follow-up Examination Schedule (complications 
and speciﬁ  c problems should be managed on an individual patient 
basis):
1. One week from the initial lens dispensing to patient
2. One month post-dispensing
3. Every three to six months thereafter
NOTE: Preferably, at the follow-up visits, lenses should be worn for at least 
six hours.
Recommended Procedures for Follow-up Visits:
1. Solicit and record patient’s symptoms, if any.
2. Measure visual acuity monocularly and binocularly at distance and
near with the contact [CONTACT_13276].
3. Perform an over-refraction at distance and near to check for residual
refractive error.
4. With the biomicroscope, judge the lens ﬁ  tting characteristics (as 
described in the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES) and evaluate
the lens surface for deposits and damage.
5. Following lens removal, examine the cornea and conjunctiva with
the biomicroscope and ﬂ  uorescein (unless contraindicated).
• The presence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central 
cornea and/or corneal neovascularization is indicative of 
excessive corneal edema.
• The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal-conjunctival 
hyperemia can be indicative of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens wear and/or a poorly ﬁ  tting lens.
• Papi[INVESTIGATOR_35465]/or damaged lens.
6. Periodically perform keratometry and spectacle refractions. The 
values should be recorded and compared to the baseline meas-
urements.
If any observations are ab sional judgment to 
alleviate the problem and optimal conditions. If
CR-  
Page 98 of 147JJVC
the criteria for successful ﬁ  t are not satisﬁ  ed during any follow-up 
examinations, repeat the patient’s trial ﬁ  tting procedure and reﬁ  t 
the patient.
WEARING SCHEDULE
The wearing schedule should be determined by [CONTACT_35578].   
Regular checkups, as determined by [CONTACT_35578], are also extremely important.
Patients tend to overwear the lenses initially. The Eye Care Professional 
should emphasize the importance of adhering to the initial maximum wear-ing schedule.  Maximum wearing time should be determined by [CONTACT_35579]’s physiological eye condition, because individual response to contact [CONTACT_35580].
The maximum suggested wearing time for these lenses is:
Day Hours
[ADDRESS_35074] spare lenses or spectacles available.
Basic Instructions
•Always wash, rinse, and dry hands before handling contact [CONTACT_13276].
•Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions
for lubricating or rewetting lenses. Do not put lenses in the mouth.
•Eye Care Professionals may recommend a lubricating/rewettingsolution which can be used to wet (lubricate) lenses while they arebeing worn to make them more comfortable.
Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the patient should be instructed to apply 
a few drops of the recommended lubricating or rewetting solution directly to the eye and wait until the lens begins to move freely on the eye before removing it. If non-movement of the lens continues after a few minutes, the patient should immediately consult the Eye Care Professional.
EMERGENCIES
The patient should be informed that if chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, etc.) are splashed into the eyes, the patient should: FLUSH EYES IMMEDIATELY WITH TAP WATER AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACT [CONTACT_35581] A HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_35466].

and well-being of particip ants and site staff. If, at an y time, a participant’s safety is considered to be at risk, 
study intervention will be discontinued, and study follow- up will be conducted as outlined in the protocol.  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the add itional risks listed below need to be  considered for study participants 
and study personnel:
Additional Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic:
xThe possible transmission of the Coronaviru s infection and consequent complications, beyond the
risk of adverse events due to the investigational device and/or procedures.
xThe risk may be higher in an op tometric clinical study because of th e close contact [CONTACT_35584] (since the investigator
must make the measurements close to the subject’s face) and, in addition the need for multiple
follow-up visits/exams which may expose the s ubject to other patients and/or healthcare
professionals who might be transmitting the vi rus, even if they do not have symptoms.
xPotential disruptions to the study may be necessa ry due to current or future pandemic-related
emergency restrictions, which may lead to delays in scheduled follow-up visits.
xSubjects experiencing an adverse event related to contact [CONTACT_35585]-[ADDRESS_35079]  contracted COVID-19 during par ticipation in a study, he/she will be 
discontinued from the study and followed un til COVID-19 Adverse Event (AE) resolution.
To help minimize the above poten tial risks, JJVCI recommend reviewin g/complying with local, state, 
and governmental guidance for COVID-19 risks. 
JJVCI will provide the following stu dy specific documents with language  pertaining to COVID-19 risks:
4.1.1 Informed Consent :

It is important to note that this stu dy will be conducted, at least in part, du ring the COVID-[ADDRESS_35080] for you. Th is is particularly important for this 
study due, in part, to the closeness of the doctor during the study examinations. 
The potential effects of the disease are not fully known, at this time, and may include long-term serious health 
consequences. In severe cases, this may result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or death. Based on current knowledge from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), thos e at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include 
older adults and people with underlying medical conditions. 
During this study, all appropriate measur es will be taken to minimize risks in cluding the use of personal protective 
equipment such as masks and gloves, as well as proper sanitizatio n. This is in conformance to guidance from the 
CDC, local health departments, and the state and county in which the study doctor’s office  is located. However, 
these measures may not completely eliminate the risks associated with contracting COVID-19. 
If you are found to have contracted COVID-19 or feel ill with flu-like symptoms during  participation in the study, 
you will not be permitted to continue in-office study follow-up visits, but you will receive instructions and your condition will be monitored by [CONTACT_35586]/or study staff.
4.1.[ADDRESS_35081] (Attachment-B):
Will include COVID-[ADDRESS_35082] JJVCI clinical 
studies. The risk controls are consistent with CDC, AOA, AAO Guidance. The Principal
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5972]/sign the study specific  checklist prior to the Site Initiation Meeting.
4.1.3 Protocol Compliance Investigator(s) Signature [CONTACT_3490]:
Will include a statement indicating that the Principal Investigator (PI) agrees to conduct the study 
in compliance with all local, state, and governmental guidance’s for COVID-[ADDRESS_35083] read the suggested guida nce provided by [CONTACT_19610]-19 risk mitigation,
(COVID-19 Work Instruction in the Appendix of this protocol). I agree to conduct this study in 
compliance with local, state, gove rnmental guidance for COVID-19 risks.
4.1.4 Study Site Initiation Training Slides:
Will include suggestions to h elp mitigate potential transmission of COVID-19. Suggestions may 
include maintaining social distancin g in the clinical site by [CONTACT_35587],
wearing proper PPEs, frequent disinfection, and installing sh ields on the slit lamp and other 
applicable equipment.
5.[ADDRESS_35084] VISITS
Potential disruptions to the study may be necessary due  to current or future pandemic-related emergency 
restrictions.  Possible disruption of the study as a re sult of COVID-19 control measures may lead to delays 
in scheduled follow-up visits.
Subjects may be delayed in being seen for study follow up visit(s), for exam ple due to COVID-[ADDRESS_35085]’s concerns or fears about COVID-[ADDRESS_35086] during remote assessments 
may include:

ComplianceRecord the average wearing time (in cluding number of hours per day 
during weekdays and weekends, and number of days per week).
Confirm compliance with the prescribed wear schedule.
xRecord and discuss the lens wear compliance based on the
subject’s self -report. For example, the subjects w ill be asked the
time of the day the subject typic ally puts on the study lenses in the
morning and takes off in the evenin g, the number of days per week
lenses were worn, and the number of consecutive days the subject
didn’t wear the study lenses, etc.
The discussion with the subject will be documented in EDC under T ele-Visit and a minor protocol deviation 
will be noted. If during the telephone consultation, a s ubject states he/she wishes to discontinue participating 
in the study, instruct the subject to stop wearing the study lenses and sche dule the subject to return to the 
clinic for a Final Evaluation at  the at earliest possible tim e. Subjects should return all unused lenses to the 
clinic at the last visit.
Changes in study visit schedules, mi ssed visits, or participant discontin uations may lead to missing data, 
including data related to protocol-specified proce dures. Case report forms should capture specific 
information regarding the basis of  missing data, including the relatio nship to the COVID-[ADDRESS_35088] DURING PANDEMIC
It is recognized that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVI D-19) pandemic may have an impact on the conduct 
of this clinical study due to, for example, self-iso lation/quarantine by [CONTACT_19611]-site personnel; 
travel restrictions/limited acce ss to public places, includi ng Optometry Clinics; and changes in clinic 
procedures required to address the COVID-19 challenge.
Every effort should be made to adhe re to protocol-specified assessment s for study participants, including 
follow-up. However, if scheduled visits cannot be condu cted in person at the study site it is suggested that 
assessments be performed to the extent possible re motely/virtually or delayed until such time that on-site 
visits can be resumed in order to continue participan t monitoring in accordance with the protocol where 
possible. At each contact,  participants will be interviewed to co llect safety data. Key efficacy endpoint 
assessments should be performe d if required and as feasible.
Modifications to protocol-required assessments may be permitted via COVID-19 Appendix after consultation 
with the participant, investigator, and the sponsor. Missed assessment s/visits will be captured in the clinical 
trial management system for protocol deviations. Interruptions of test article wear or discontinuations of 
study interventions and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID -19-
related” in the case report form (CRF).

Background: 
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  is a chronic disease characterized by [CONTACT_217755].  One of the presumptions in 
this disease is that antigen recognitio n occurs in the esophagus by [CONTACT_217756] a TH2 allergic response.  Although it is speculated that the esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_217751], this is not well proven.  
Mucosal imped ance reflects the ability of electric current to flow between two sensors while in 
contact [CONTACT_217757][INVESTIGATOR_2130].  An increase in  current flow is presumably due to an increase in ions 
and water crossing the membrane, which are good conductors of electricity.  Through this 
technique an overall measure of “leakiness” of the esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_217752].  This 
increased permeability may reflect epi[INVESTIGATOR_217753], a change in epi[INVESTIGATOR_217754]’s esophagus or in conditions in which there 
are dilated intercellular spaces as has been observed in both gastroesophageal reflux and 
eosinophilic esophagitis. 
While standard diagnostic evaluation for EoE includes upper endoscopy with esophageal 
biopsies, a ssessment of mucosal impedance is not.  Recently, a new technology has emerged 
allowing for direct assessment of mucosal impedance at the time of routine upper endoscopy.  
Yuksel and colleagues have described use of a 2mm diameter  single -channel catheter used 
during the time of EGD which demonstrated lower mucosal impedance in areas of erosive 
esophagitis and in the mucosa of patients with nonerosive reflux disease compared to healthy 
controls.
1 In the same manner, mucosal impedance may be lower in patients  with EoE, allowing 
for submucosal antigen exposure and the characteristic Th2 response. 
Hypothesis: 
Patient with eosinophilic esophagitis have diminished mucosal impedance, reflecting increased 
permeability to allergens  occurring at least in the esophagus and possibly in the buccal mucosa. 
Primary Aim:  

1. Assess mucosal impedance in patients with EoE  of both the esophageal and buccal 
mucosa.  
Secondary Aim:  
2. Changes in mucosal impedance in patients with EoE following treatment 
Methods:   
Study Design:  
Patients r eferred to the Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster either with an establish or suspected 
diagnosis of EoE will be identified.  Those scheduled for clinically indicated upper 
endoscopy for esophageal biopsies either for initial diagnosis or activity assessment of 
EoE wil l be studied.  After investigation of established or suspected EoE, a total of 75 
patients with confirmed EoE patients .  In addition, patients undergoing clinically 
indicated upper endoscopy for indications either than gastroesophageal reflux or 
dysphagia will be studied as controls.  A total of 10 control patients will be studied.  
Inclusion criteria:  
 
• Adults ages 18-90 undergoing clinically indicated upper endoscopy  
• Patients with EoE, defined as dysphagia with histologic finding of greater than or 
equal t o [ADDRESS_261281] 6 weeks of twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy 
• Patients undergoing clinically indicated upper endoscopy for indications other 
than dysphagia or GERD with normal appearing esophageal mucosa.  
 
Exclusion criteria: 
• Medical conditions such as severe heart or lung disease that preclude safe performance of endoscopy  
• Patients with conditions known to be associated with esophageal eosinophilia, including Crohn’s disease, Churg- Strau ss, achalasia, and hypereosinophilic 
syndrome 
• Inability to read due to: Blindness, cognitive dysfunction, or English language illiteracy  
 
Study Flow:  
Patient undergoing clinically indicated endoscopy and esophageal biopsies for diagnosis or 
assessing activ ity of  eosinophilic esophagitis will be identified.  In addition, patients undergoing 
clinically indicated upper endoscopy for indications other than dysphagia or GERD will be 
identified: 
  
1. Before commencing the procedure, a baseline impedance will be obtained by [CONTACT_217758]/her buccal mucosa for 1  minute 
for an initial reading.  
2. Clinically indicated endoscopic exam will be completed  
3. On withdrawal of the upper endoscope into the esophagus, a 2.13mm mucosal 
impedance catheter (Figure) will be passed through the channel of the standard upper 
endoscope. 
4. The probe will be placed on the esophageal mucosa 5cm above the gastroesophageal 
junction for [ADDRESS_261282] adding the buccal mucosal impedance testing.  
Impedance testing  
Statistical Ana lysis:  
As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], ten patients will be studied before and after treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis .  
This number of patients will be increased if there are treatment failures until there is a total of ten 
effectively treated patients studied.  Effecti ve treatment is defined by [CONTACT_217759].  Ten control patients without esophageal disease will be studied.  
Primary Endpoint: 
1. Mean and median mucosal impedance in patients with EoE patients compared to controls 
 
Secondary Endpoints: 
2. Maximal mucosal impedance in EoE patients compared to minimal mucosal impedance in control patients to determine a potential diagnostic cutoff value 
3. Mean and median mucosal impedance in EoE patients post treatment in co mparison to 
pretreatment

SECTION B:  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
 
B1.  ABSTRACT    
Negative hematological adaptations  due to prolonged periods of strenuous  physical activity  may, in part,  
contribute to declines in physical performance during military operations . Exogenous erythropoietin 
(EPO) is a potential intervention that m ay be used to maintain  hemoglobin (hgb), hematocrit ( Hct), and 
physical perform ance during periods of high physical activity . The objective of the current study  is to 
determine the ability  of EPO  to maintain hgb, Hct,  and physical performance compared to baseline 
measures . Additionally, EPO may result in non- hematological adaptations which increase m itochondria 
biogenesis and alter substrate oxidation.  As such, t his study will also assess the influence of EPO on 
whole -body and skeletal muscle substrate oxidation. . Eight  healthy physically active individuals will be 
recruited to participate in this longitudinal trial. After exercise practice sessions, volunteers will complete 
baseline physical performance (time trial ) and substrate oxidation testing . Participants will then  receive 
EPO injecti ons 3 times per week for 4 weeks . Diet and exercise will be controlled during the injection 
period. Participants will undergo four weeks of an intense physical training exercise program. Ever y 
seventh day during the injection period a safety blood sample, assessing hematocrit, will be drawn, and  
participants will complete a 5 km time trial to determine the time course of changes in physical performance can be detected.  After the 4 week s of EPO  injections  volunteers will complete the same 
physical performance and substrate oxidation testing. Substrate oxidation will be assessed during 90-min 
steady -state load carriage (30% body mass) exercise on a treadmill at 55 ± 5% of VO
2peak.  6-6-[2H2] 
glucose tracer t echnique  and indirect calorimetry will be used measure substrate oxidation. Muscle 
biopsies will be performed to measure muscle glycogen, enzyme activity, and molecular marker s of 
metabolism  and inflammation before, and immediately and [ADDRESS_810073] exercise.  Multiple blood samples 
will be collected throughout the study to determine alterations in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and markers of 
substrate metabolism, and inflammation. All study procedures  will occur at [LOCATION_003]RIEM. The primary risks 
associated with this study include those associated with EPO injection, exercise, blood draws, and 
muscle biopsies.  
 
B2.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE    
 
Protocol Title: Impact of erythropoietin on hematological adaptations and physical performance  
Date: [ADDRESS_810074]  2022  
 
Date: HQ [LOCATION_003]MRDC IRB Research Protocol Template v 20September 2018  DO NOT TOUCH FOOTERS (THIS IS OURS AND HEADERS ARE YOURS)                     Page 5 of 39 Overtraining and strenuous military operations result  in negative hematological adapta tions , with 
hemoglobin (hgb)  concentrations  and hematocrit  (Hct) values significantly decreased (1 -4)(Figure 1 ). 
These negative effects  have been linked to increased circulating concentrations of the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine IL- 6 (5). Increased circulating IL-6 stimulates inc reased concentrations of the iron-regulatory 
hormone hepcidin (6, 7) . Hepcidin reduces the efflux of iron into circulation by [CONTACT_610969] (8). This results in reduced absorption of 
dietary iron and release of iron from macrophages,  inhibiting  distribution of iron  to tissues in the body (9) . 
Prolonged or multiple bouts of exercise have been shown to result in greater increases of circulating IL -6 
(10, 11) .  Additionally , elevated concentrations of hepcidin can pers ist for [ADDRESS_810075] exercise (12). 
Without adequate recovery, these elevations in IL -6 and hepcidin in response to sustained performance 
of arduous physical activity results in negative hematological adaptations and potential declines in 
physical performance. O ur laboratory has  reported multi -day strenuous military trainings results in 
increased concentr ations of circulating IL- 6 and hepcidin (3, 4)  and decreased hgb concentrations (3) . 
These negative hematological adaptations to military training has been associated with declines in physical performance (1, 13) . 
 
 
The negative hematological adaptations accompanying strenuous physical training can be partially 
alleviated by [CONTACT_610970]  (13, 14) , but hgb and Hct  do not fully recover to the levels 
observed when consuming an iron supplement without performing physical t raining (14). This blunted 
response to iron supplementation with training is likely the result of increased hepcidin concentrations 
inhibiting absorption of dietary iron. Our laboratory recently found following  a 3 day simulated military 
operation, where participants ’ exercise -induced energy expenditure was ~2000 kcal/d, elevations in IL -6 
and hepcidin resulted in a ~50% reduction in iron absorption (15). These physiological consequences to 
sustained strenuous exercise led to reductions in hgb concentrations and dec lines in physical 
performance, despi[INVESTIGATOR_610935] 22 mg/d iron, well above the recommended dietary 
allowance (RDA) of 8 mg/d for men. R esults  from this study  suggest more robust  interventions are 
required to mitigate associated negative hematol ogical adapta tions and declines in physical performance 
associated with extended periods of strenuous physical activity .  
 
Recognizing the need for more aggressive interventions to the Army has developed the Biomedical 
Performance Enhancement (BPE) program. One of the goals of this program is to identify pharmaceutical 
interventions to enhance physical performance. Exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) is one potential 
intervention that fits within the BPE program to eliminate physiological decrem ents during military 
operations . EPO is a hormone produced in the kidney, that stimulates  erythropoiesis, production of red 
blood cells, in bone marrow (16) . Stimulation of  red blood cell production corrects negative hematological 
adaptations, increasing h gb concentration  and Hct values  (16). Exogenous EPO results in higher levels 
of hgb and Hct compared to placebo (17 -19). It is important to not e, exogenous EPO requires iron to 
induce erythropoiesis.  Interestingly, administration of exogenous EPO with low systemic iron availability 
has been reported to reduce circulating hepcidin concentrations by [CONTACT_229274] , resulting in 
increased hgb and Hct (20). Furthermore, our laboratory has recently  demonstrate that secondary 
elevations in circulating EPO  following exogenous testosterone administration resulted in lower  hepcidin 
and IL -6, and higher hgb and HCT values following 21 days of exercise- induced (~1400 kcal/d)  energy 
deficits  compared to pl acebo while consuming 18 mg/d dietary iron  (21);Table 1 ).These finding may 
suggest  that despit e reduced iron efflux with overtraining, EPO may still be an effective intervention to 
maintain hgb, Hct, and physical performance. However, w hether elevated IL- 6 and hepcidin 
concentrations with overtraining suppress the effectiveness of exogenous EPO is unknown.

Beyond those well characterized hematological adaptations, exogenous EPO has recently been 
discovered to result in non- hematological adaptations (22) ; Figure 2 ). Annaheim et al. (22)  reported that 
changes in physical pe rformance with exogenous EPO were independent of increases in VO 2max and 
red blood cell volume. Non- hematological 
adaptations resulting in improved performance  may 
be the result of molecular  alterations within skeletal 
muscle. Exogenous EPO has been shown to 
increase markers of mitochondrial biogenesis  (23) 
and improve mitochondrial respir atory capacity, 
increasing oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport capacity (24) . However, while some 
investigations have reported changes in skeletal 
muscle molecular biology in response to exogenous 
EPO, there are others that have repor ted no effect 
on skeletal muscle (25- 27). Controversy regarding 
the impact of EPO on skeletal muscle  revolves 
around debate of whether an EPO receptor (EPO -R) is present at the skeletal muscle level  (28, 29) . The 
absence of EPO -R with skeletal muscle would indicate that there is no direct effect of EPO on skeletal 
muscle. While it is possible that EPO may not have a direct effect on skeletal muscle morphology, there 
is potential that EPO has indirect effects that result in alterations in molecular pathways regulating substrate oxidation within skeletal muscle. Exogenous EPO  increase fat and decreases carbohydrate 
oxidation during exercise (19) . Alterations in whole -body substrate oxidation during exercise are the 
result of changes in molecular regulation within skeletal muscle (30) . Shifts in substrate oxidation would 
suggest that alterations do occur within skeletal m uscle, if not directly, then potentially due to changes in 
hormone concentrations of O
2 delivery to skeletal muscle. The influence of exogenous EPO on pathways 
regulating substrate oxidation within skeletal muscle has not been thoroughly assessed.  Additionally , 
increased capacity to oxidize fatty acids and decreased reliance of carbohydrate for fuel during exercise 
with exogenous EPO likely results in spa ring of muscle glycogen stores.  Maintaining high muscle 
glycogen content has been well -established to im prove physical performance (31) . Beyond performance 
improvement, higher gl ycogen stores may  also have additional benefit in  reducing the inflammatory 
response to exercise  (5). Muscle glycogen depletion following aerobic exercise results in increased IL-6 
gene expression in skeletal muscle, as well as increased circulating IL- 6 concentrations compared to 
higher glycogen content (32). Potential for exogenous EPO to spare muscle glycogen and reduce post 
exercise inflammation may  contribute to lower hepcidin concentrations observed with exogenous EPO 
administration described above (20).Though some work (19, 24)  has been done to show alteration in 
carbohydrate and fat  oxidation fol lowing exogenous EPO use, no in -depth analysis has been performed 
assessing changes in substrate oxidation at the whole body and skeletal muscle level. Specifically, no studies has examined the influence of EPO on glucose kinetics, glycogen storage, or the intramuscular 
molecular pathways that regulate skeletal muscle oxidation and inflammation.  Furthermore, w hether non -
hematological adaptations  with exogenous EPO compensates for potential blunted hem atological

longitudinal trial. After baseline assessments of body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR), VO 2peak  
and exercise familiarization;  volunteers will complete  physical performance and substrate oxidation 
testing (Figure 3). Physical performance will be assessed using time t rial. Substrate oxidation will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_610972] 90-min of steady -state load carriage (30% body mass) exercise on a 
treadmill at 55 ± 5% of their VO 2peak . 6-6-[2H2] glucose will be used as a tracer to assess glucose 
turnover. Indirect calorimetry  will be used to determine carbohydrate and fat oxidation.  Muscle biopsies 
will be performed to measure muscle glycogen, enzyme activity, and molecular markers of substrate 
metabolism before, immediately after, and 3- hrs post exercise. Multiple blood samples will be collected

exercise performance, volunteers will not exercise for [ADDRESS_810083] two days of this period , 
volunteers will undergo carbon monoxide (CO) rebreathing to measure Hgb mass  and blood volume. 
Volunteers will then receive EPO injections [ADDRESS_810084] ing of a 
combination o f endurance-  and resistance- type exercise . During the final week of the  injection phase 
body composition, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and VO 2peak  will be reassessed. At the end of the 4-
week injection phase volunteers  will complete a final  physical performance test  and substrate oxidation 
protocol , followed by [CONTACT_610973] . All food and beverages (except 
water) will be provided to volunteers beginning at the pre injection physical performance and substrate 
oxidation through the duration of the study.  All data collection will occur at [LOCATION_003]RIEM.

Erythropoietin Injections (Credentialed procedure) : A dose (50 IU/kg body mass)  of recombinant 
human EPO (PROCRIT, EPOETIN ALFA, Janssen Products, LP,  Titusville, NJ, [LOCATION_003]) will be injected 
subcutaneously 3 times per week for 4 week . Injections will be performed by [CONTACT_610974]. The Office of Medical Support and Oversight (OMSO) will be the prescriber of prescription 
drugs used in this protocol, to include EPO. The dosing amount and frequency is on -label dosing 
equivalent to pediatric dosing.  This dose and duration has previously been shown to be sufficient to result 
in hematological adaptions and increase physical performance (18, 19, 33) . Hematocrit  and hemoglobin 
will be checked weekly to ensure values remain < 50%. If Hct increases above 50%, EPO injections will 
be stopped  and Hct will be reassessed within 3 days.  If hemoglobin increases more than 1 g/dL over a [ADDRESS_810085] vital signs checked (blood pressure, heart rate, and

procedure will be credentialed and listed on the DOA log with code “F.”         
 
 
Body Composition (credential procedure): Body composition will be determined using dual energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA, DPX -IQ, GE Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI). The DEXA technique allows for 
the non -invasive assessment of soft tissue composition by  [CONTACT_244601] a precision of 1- 3% (34). The 
volunteer will lay face- up on the DEXA densitometer table in shorts, t -shirts, and stocking feet. Volunteers 
will be asked to remain motionless for the 8- [ADDRESS_810087] prior to body 
composition testing. Female staff members will oversee pregnancy tests. Study personnel conducting body composition scans will be credent ialed and listed on the DOA log with code “U.”    
 
Height and Weights (non -credentialed procedure) : Height will be measured to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_810088] (≥ 8 hr), using a calibrated 
digital scale to t he nearest 0.1 kg at screening.  Body mass will be measured at baseline, once a week 
during the injection period.  
 Diet and Exercise Records (non -credentialed procedure) : Volunteers will complete a 3- d diet record 
(Appendix B) and a 3 -d activity log ( Appendix C) according to instructions provided by [CONTACT_610976] (35). The data will be analyzed using Food Processor SQL
TM (Salem, OR Version 10.0) and the 
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Compendium of Physical Activities, respectively. These 
forms will be  completed at baseline to characterize volunteers’ habitual diet and exercise habits .   
 V̇O
2peak (credentialed procedure) : Following an overnight fast (10 hrs) , volunteers will complete a  
maximal aerobic exercise sessions to determine peak oxygen uptake ( V̇O2peak) on a treadmill.  V̇O2peak 
will be determined using an indirect, open circuit respi[INVESTIGATOR_610937] (Parvomedics).  Volunteers will be 
clothed in appropriate athletic attire and perform  this assessment at standard ambient indoor temperature 
(20-22°C) and humidity conditions (30 -80%). Volunteers will be given adequate time to become familiar 
with the testing procedures and allowed a [ADDRESS_810089]. The volunteers will begin by 
[CONTACT_244602] 4 min at a pace predetermined as comfort able at a 0% grade. At 4 -min, the grade will be 
increased to 4% followed by [CONTACT_33018] 2% every 2 min thereafter until volitional exhaustion. Assessment of V ̇O
2peak will be done bef ore and during the last week of the injection phase. Changes in 
V̇O2peak  after injections  will be taken into account to adjust the speed and grade of the treadmill during 
steady -state load carriage exercise.   
 
Heart rate will be monitored throughout exercise using a heart -rate monitor (Polar Electro Inc, Oulu, 
Finland) , and r ecord during the last [ADDRESS_810090] reports angina- like symptoms, exertional syncope, shows signs of 
poor perfusion (i.e., light -headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cy anosis, nausea, or cold and clammy

when 20- min of steady state oxygen consumption ( V̇O2) and carbon dioxide production ( V̇CO 2) are 
recorded. This measurement will be repeated during the last week of the injection  phase to assess for 
changes in RMR. Baseline assessment of  RMR, a factor of daily living, and Harris Benedict equation will 
be used to determine energy needs for study diets .    
 
Study Diets (non- credentialed procedure) : Registered Dietitians will develop individualized daily menus  
using Food Processor SQL (ESHA Research, Salem, OR, Version 10.14). The diets will be derived 
primarily from components of the US military Meals Ready -to-Eat (MRE) rations to achieve appropriate 
macronutrient proportions.  Energy content of diets during gl ycogen normalization will match volunteers 
estimated energy  needs to maintain body weight . Volunteers will be consuming a diet providing 
approximately 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30% fat.  Dietary iron will be controlled for providing a 
minimum of 18mg/day to ensure recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for both males (8mg/day) and 
females (18mg/day) is met.  
 
Time Trial (credentialed procedure) : Following a [ADDRESS_810094], volunteers will complete a 5 
kilometer t ime trial. The treadmill will be set at a constant 1% grade (36)  for the entire test. Following a 
warm -up period, volunteers will blindly modulate treadmill speed in order to com plete the distance as 
quickly as possible. The only feedback given will be distance covered at half mile increments. At half mile 
increments volunteers’ rate of perceived exertion will be determined using the Borg Scale. Heart rate will 
be monitored throughout the time trial. Heart rate will be recorded at half mile increments. No motivation 
will be provided during the time trial. Participants may consume water ad libitum  during the time trial. 
Following completion of the test, a self -selected cool -down will occur. Volunteers will complete a 
minimum of two practice exercise sessions to ensure they are familiar with the performance test.  The 
practice sessions also will establish the coefficient of variation. Study personnel conducting maximal 
aerobic testing will be credentialed and li sted on the DOA log with code “J .”     
 Study Exercise (non- credentialed procedure) : During the injection phase  volunteers will conduct 
prescribed exercise training 4 days  and 1 day of physical performance testing (time trial)  per week. 
Volunteers will perform both weighted (treadmill  or outdoor ; walking, running, and load carriage) and 
unweighted (cycle ergometry)  endurance- type exercise, and resistance -type exercise throughout the 
protocol. Exercise will be metabolically matched between groups, with exercise- induced energy 
expenditure being 1000- 1500 kcal per day . Prescribed endurance -type exercise will be l ow-to-high 
intensity (30- 85% V̇O
2peak ) using the ACSM metabolic equations for steady -state exercise (37)  and the 
compendium of metabolic equivalents for physical activities.  This level of training is sim ilar to that 
conducted during arduous military training in garrison (38) . VO 2peak will be assessed after 2 weeks into 
the injection phase. Exercise intensity will be adjusted based on alterations in VO 2peak. Study personnel 
conducting exercise will be listed on the DOA log with code “V.”    
 
Load Carriage Exercise (non -credentialed procedure) : Volunteers will complete 90 -min of weighted 
steady -state exercise on a treadmill at 55 ± 5% of their VO 2peak , with 30% of volunteer’s body mass. The 
speed and grade of the treadmill will be determined us ing the ACSM metabolic equation for walking 
based on desired V ̇O2 (39). Prior to the protocol day, participants will perform a practice session of the 
treadmill exercise to confirm the prescribed speed and grade are appropriate to induce target V ̇O2. The 
treadmill speed and grade will be maintained for both arms of the study to match the absolute workload 
of the exercise across treatments. Study personnel conducting t readmill load carriage will be listed on the 
DOA log with code “V.”   
 
Carbohydrate Tracer Study (credentialed procedure) : Following an overnight (10 hour) fast, two 
catheters will be placed into the lower arm (one in each arm). One arm will be used for infusion of 6,6-
[2H2] glucose tracer and the other will be used for blood sampling. Following an initial blood sample 
collection to determine background enrichments, a primed, continuous infusion of 6,6- [2H2] glucose will 
begin (prime, 82.2 µmol∙kg-1; continuous rate, 0.78 µmol∙kg-1∙min-1, Figure 4). The 6,6 -[2H2] glucose will

initiating exercise.  Volunteers will then perform 90 min of steady -state (~55 ±  5 % of VO 2peak) load 
carriage (~30% body mass) exercise. During exercise V ̇O2, V̇CO 2, and HR will be measured  6 times  at 
approximately 0, 20, 45, 60, 75, and 85 min. A total of 12  V̇O2, V̇CO 2, and HR  during the two 
carbohydrate tracer studies  Credentialed personnel  performing venous catheterization will be listed on 
the DOA log with code “T.”

Percutaneous Muscle Biopsy of the Vastus Lateralis (credentialed procedure) : Percutaneous muscle 
biopsies will be obtained from the vastus lateralis using a 5 mm Bergstrom needle with manual suction 
while the volunteer is under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine or similar ) according to the approved 
[LOCATION_003]RIEM SOP (40, 41) . Muscle biopsies will be performed  immediately  before, after, and post load 
carriage exercise.  Each v olunteer will have a total of 6  muscle biopsies during the entire study.  
Credentialed personnel performing muscle biopsies will be listed on the DOA log with code “R.”     
 
Blood Sampling ( credentialed procedure) : Blood samples will occur after an  overnight  (10 hour)  fast. 
Blood collection for safety blood draws and CO rebreathing will be conducting using venipuncture. Safety 
blood draws will occur once a week during the injection (4  times) and follow -up period (2 times) of the 
protocol.  Blood will be collected using an indwelling catheter kept patent  using IV saline at approximately 
-100, -20, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and  [ADDRESS_810096] amounts of blood during these 
measures. A total of 2 6 venipuncture and IV blood draws (Appendix F) will be comple ted during this study 
taking ~ 360 mL of blood sampled from each volunteer over the protocol days ( Table 2). Blood samples 
will be used for isotope analysis assessment of nutrient status,  hormone responses, and inflammation 
(Table 2).   
  
For glucose kinetic analysis, the tracer/trace ratio (6,6 -[2H2] glucose/glucose)  will be measured on the 
pentaacetate derivative by [CONTACT_134276] -chromatography -mass spectrometry ( Metabolic Solutions, Inc., Nashua, 
NH). Credentialed personnel performing venipuncture and/or venous catheterization will be listed on the 
DOA log with code “S and T.”

Samples will be analyzed at  1Metabolic Solutions (Nashua, NH)  and 2[LOCATION_003]RIEM . All blood samples will be 
separated into plasma and serum through centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at – 80˚C until analysis or 
shipment. Study s amples will be collected and aliquoted at [LOCATION_003]RIEM and specific samples will be 
shipped on dry ice to Metabolic Solution.  Blood sent out to other laboratories for analysis will not have 
any remaining samples  after analysis is completed.  [LOCATION_003]RIEM will retain a ll archive samples.  
 
Plasma Glucose Turnover Calculations  
For cal culation of plasma  glucose turnover the Steele equation with modifications for non -steady state will 
be used (44). Enrichment (E) will be  expressed as  mole percent excess (MPE);  calculated as (TTR)/(1 + 
TTR), where TTR is  the tracer to tracee ratio. Appropriate corrections for skew ed abundance distribution

Total glucose R a (Total R a) = (F –  ((pV x ((C 2 + C 1)) / 2) x ((E 2 - E1) / (t2 - t1)))) / ((E 2 + E 1) / 2) 
Glucose R d = Total R a – (pV (C 2 - C1) / (t2 - t1)) 
Metabolic Clearance Rate (MCR) = Glucose R d / ((C 2 + C 1) / 2)   
 
Where F represents the infusion rate of 6,6 -[2H2] glucose; p V is the effective volume of distribution for 
glucose, C 1 and C 2 are plasma glucose concentrations at t 1 and t 2, respectively, E 1 and E 2 are plasma 
enrichments of 6,6- [2H2] glucose at t 1 and t 2, respectively.  
 
Calculations of Carbohydrate  and Fat Oxidation  
Carbohydrate, fat, and protein oxidation rates will be  calculated from V̇O2 (L/min) and V ̇CO 2 (L/min)  
during the 9 0-min exercise bout as described by [CONTACT_610977]  (45): 
 
Fat oxidation (g/min)  = 1.695 × V̇O2 (L/min) − 1.701 × V̇CO 2 (L/min)  
Total carbohydrate oxidation (g/min) = 4.585 × V ̇CO 2 (L/min)  − 3.226 × V̇O2 (L/min).  
 
Muscle Glycogen  
Glycogen concentration will be determined using ~3 mg (dry weight)  freeze dried muscle homogenized in 
water using a TissueLyser II with a 5-mm steel bead (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, [LOCATION_003]). Homogenates w ill be 
boiled at 100°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 13,000×g for 5 min at  room temperature. Supernatant w ill be 
removed and muscle glycogen concentrations w ill be assessed using an endpoint colorimetric assay  
(Cat# MAK016; Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, [LOCATION_003]).      
 
Immunohistochemistry  
Resting fasted muscle samples before and after EPO dosing will be frozen for cross -section analysis to 
include but not limited to fiber typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Muscle s ections w ill be  stained with antibodies against either 
myosin heavy chain I or myosin heavy chain IIA . Sections w ill then be  incubated with appropriate 
conjugated secondary antibodies for one  hour at 37 °C ( Alexa Fluor -568, Molecular Probes, Life 
Technologies). Fluorescent -conjugated (AlexaFluor488)  Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) will be used to 
stain the  extracellular matrix for the calculation of  fiber cross -sectional area using Image J  software.

Biosystems, Foster City, CA, [LOCATION_003])  or equivalent . Individual Taqman® probes (Applied Biosystems)  or 
microarray (Qiagen)  will be used to determ ine the mRNA expression of intramuscular molecular 
regulation to include but not limited to, PGC -1α, PPARs, SIRT1, p53, CPT1a, FABP, FAT, TNF-α, TNF -
αR, IL -6, IL-6R, TWEAK, and TWEAK- R. microRNA analysis will be conducted using individual  Taqman® 
probes (Applied Biosystems)  or microarray  (Qiagen) , assessing microRNA that may be associated with 
metabolism  and inflammation. This microRNA targets will include, but not be limited to, miR -1, miR-
23a/b, miR -26, miR -29, miR -34a, miR -103, miR -107, miR- 133a/b, miR -146, miR -206, miR -208a, miR -
486, and miR -499a.  
   
Expression of  microRNA  will also be assessed in circulation using Taqman® probes (Applied Biosystems)  
or microarray (Qiagen). Circulating  miRNA will be extracted from 200 µL serum using miRNeasy 
Serum/Plasma kit, which allows for extraction and purification of small (< 200 nucleotides ) cell -free RNA 
(Qiagen or equivalent ). To avoid introduction of potentially contaminating material, prior t o RNA extraction 
serum samples will be centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris.  Supernatant will be 
removed and transferred to a new tube without disturbing the pellet.  Due to the small amount of RNA in 
the serum, 3.5 µL of a Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -In Con trol (C. elegans miR -39; Qiagen or equivalent ) will be added to all 
samples prior to extraction of RNA to determine the yield of template recovered.  After extraction 3 μl of 
serum RNA will reverse transcribed using the TaqMan® microRNA RT kit (Applied Bio systems) or 
equivalent with miRNA -specific stem -loop RT primers pooled in 1X -Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer for a final 
dilution of 0.05X.  A pre- amplification step will be performed after reverse transcription to increase cDNA 
template using a primer pool of 20 X Taqman® Small RNA Assay s (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent for 
miRNA of interest at 0.05X concentration in 1X TE buffer.  All serum miRNA will be normalized to the 
geometric mean of external (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]- In Control C. elegans miR -39) and internal controls to allow for both 
technical and inter -individual normalization (46) . Geometric mean of controls will be used to correct for 
possible outlying values and abundance differences between the different controls (47) .   
 
All reverse transcription for mRNA and miRNA, and pre -amplification of serum miRNA will b e conducted 
in a T100TM Thermal Cycler (Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA  or similar model ). A StepOnePlusTM real-time PCR 
system (Applied Biosystems)  or similar model  will be used to perfor m all mRNA and miRNA analysis. 
Fold changes will be calculated using the ∆∆cyc le threshold (∆∆ CT) method . 
 
Bioinformatics Analysis  
microRNA  with significant changes in their expression will be uploaded to DNA Intelligent Analysis 
(DIANA) -miRPath 3.0 (Alexander Fleming Biological Sciences Research Center [BSRC], Athens, Greece; 
http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr) to determine potential molecular pathways that these microRNA have 
previously been reported to regulate. Relevant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; 
http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathways will be identified using experimentally verified targets from 
TarBas e 7.0 (Alexander Fleming BSRC).  Based on findings from this analysis, any additional gene and 
protein expression of relevant targets will be assessed.    
 
Western Blotting 
Approximately 20 mg of muscle will be homogenized in ice- cold buffer (1:10 w/v) containing 50 mM Tris –

     B5.5  Managing  Data and/or Human Biological Specimens for this Research   
 
All data and medical information obtained will be considered pri vileged and held in confidence.  Study 
volunteers will be assigned unique subject identification (ID) numbers that will not contain any personal 
identifiers such as name, social security number, address, date of birth, zip code, etc. This study subject 
ID number will be used on all data collection instruments, to include questionnaires, data collection forms, 
computer records, etc. A number will be assigned as each volunteer is medically cleared for participation.  
A master list linking the volunteers’ names and ID numbers will be kept in a separate locked file in the 
principal investigator's office, or kept in a computer file with password- protected access restricted to the 
principal investigator. When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no 
information w ill be included that would reveal identity. All samples will be stored using the subject 
identification number.  De-identified samples for isotopic analysis will be shipped on dry ice to (blood) and 
room temperature (breath) to Metabolic Solutions. All samples will be shipped via FedEx and store d in 
these laboratories until analyzed. Once samples have been analyzed, t here will be no remaining sample 
for storage other than the archived sample stored at [LOCATION_003]RIEM. Coded data will be transmitted between 
the above  mentioned laboratories via an encrypted email, a secure file transfer site, or usi ng an approved 
removable media. Only [LOCATION_003]RIEM will maintain digital copi[INVESTIGATOR_610939].     
 
Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_610940]. No 
outside laboratory  will have access to identifiable data. Hard copy data records will be stored for a 
minimum of three years from the time the study is completed. Electronic data records will be maintained for a period of at leas t ten years after the study has been completed. The master list will be destroyed 
upon the protocol’s closure.

Statistical analyses will be conducted using either SPSS (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY), SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Carey, NC), or equivalent. Common descriptive statistics will be used to describe 
volunteer characteristics. Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk tests will be used to de termine normality of data. Paired t -
tests  will be used to assess  phase effects (PRE vs. POST injection ) for glucose turnover, and 
substrate oxidation. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used t o assess main effects of time for 
physical performance. Mixed -model repeated measure ANOVA will be used to assess main effects 
of phase (PRE vs. POST injection), time and their interaction for blood analytes and muscle 
molecular analysis.  If interactions ar e significant, appropriate post -hoc correction will be used to 
examine these relationships. Correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis will be used 
to evaluate relationships between study outcome measures. The alpha level will be adjusted fo r 
multiple comparisons, with the level for statistical significance set at P < 0.05.

Volunteer Program Coordinator or designee. The Coordinator will schedule the consent briefing for the HRV platoon.  
 Superiors of Service members (e.g., unit officers, senior NCOs, and equivalent civilians) shall not be 
present at any recruitment sessions or during the consent process in which members of units under their command are afforded the opportunity to participate as human subjects of research.  
 
Civilian volunteers and other active duty personnel will be recruited by “word of mouth”, posted flyers 
(“off-site recruitment flyer” to be used for any flyers posted outside of NSSC, “recruitment flyer” to be 
used for posti ngs within NSSC), or electronic distribution of the “off -site” flyer to include a text -only, 
approved version of the flyer.  Recruiting materials will be distributed around NSSC, surrounding community, and on bulletin boards at local universities. The text -based flyer will be posted on various 
[LOCATION_003]RIEM social media sites and used in distribution media requiring a text format (e.g., electronic newsletters).  Recruiting may also be conducted through briefings  presented to college classes, clubs, 
sports teams, or other organizations. Approvals from the requisite parties will be obtained prior to any recruitment activities.  
  
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_610942], and will sc hedule informed consent briefings for these potential volunteers.  
An 
ombudsman (indicated by [CONTACT_104846] “L” on the DOA Log)  will be present  for HRV briefings.  All civilian  and 
non-HRV Soldier  briefings will be done one -on-one. 
 
      C1.3  Eligibility    
 
Volunteers will be medically cleared by [CONTACT_610979],  tracer infusions, muscle 
biopsies and EPO  use at [LOCATION_003]RIEM . In addition, volunteers will be screened for problems with blood 
clotting, including prothrombin time (PT)/ partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is a specific criterion 
for research involving muscle biopsies. Health problems identified during the screening process will be 
documented and a copy provided to the volunteer. The volunteer will be encouraged to make an 
appointment with their primary care provider for a full evaluation of the problem. Volunteers with 
evidence of any physical, mental, and/or medical conditions that would make the proposed studies relatively more hazardous will be excluded. Any personal health information collected during this 
screening process will be destroyed at the time of study withdrawal or at the completion of the study.  
 
All volunteers must be willing to consume only food and beverages provided by [CONTACT_610980] .  Additionally, volunteers must be willing to refrain from any additional exercise during the 
study .   
        C1.4  Consent Process   
 
Informed consent documents will be provided to each prospective volunteer.  Additionally, an oral 
presentation will be provided to prospective volunteers by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_28678]. In 
case of COVID risk mitigation plans, briefings can be done virtually and consent forms can be emailed 
and digitally signed. The purpose of this study, procedures involved, risks, and expectations of

C2.  COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
 Military and civilian personnel will receive $5 0 for each successful blood draw. There are 2 6 blood draws  
during the entire study. Volunteers completing all  draws will receive  $1300.  If a volunteer does not complete 
the entire study, they will be compensated for the number of successful blood draws they did complete. If 
[LOCATION_003]RIEM staff fail to get a blood draw and the volunteer completes the study they will be compensated in 
full. Volunteers will not be eligible for any other form of compensation during this study.     
 
Note: Participants who receive more than $[ADDRESS_810109] this income reported t o the 
Internal Revenue Service.  
 
C3.  WITHDRAWAL FROM RESEARCH PARTICIPATION    
 Volunteers will be allowed to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would 
otherwise be entitled. They will do so by [CONTACT_305184], AI or a staff member of their intent to withdraw verbally or in writing (electronic or paper/pencil). They will then be asked to verbally discuss their choice to 
withdraw with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_610944].  An investigator may stop an 
individual’s participation in the study if the volunteer is unwilling or unable to complete study procedures.  An 
investigator may also withdraw a volunteer if the individual becomes ill or injured or it would not be in the 
volunteer’s best interest to continue. If the participant is withdrawn by [CONTACT_610981]: Impact of erythropoietin on hematological adaptations and physical performance

prior to withdrawal will be maintained. Participants will be compensated for any blood draws they completed 
up until that point, and they will be asked to return any remaining food it ems that were provided, in addition to 
any wrappers and diet/activity logs that they had completed up to the point of withdrawal.  
 
C4.  PRIVACY FOR SUBJECTS    
 
To protect the volunteer’s privacy, all of their research- related records will be labeled or “coded” with an 
assigned research volunteer number that will not include their name [CONTACT_610991].  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_610945]’s  research records in a locked cabinet.  Any documents that will require the volunteer’s name, 
such as the consent form, will be kept in a locked cabinet separate from any research documents that contain the volunteer’s ID number.  The principal investigato r and project coordinator are the only  people 
who will be able to match the research volunteer number with any of their personal identifying information.    
 When the results of the research are published no information will be included that would reveal t he 
volunteer’s identity to others . Photographs, videos, or audio- tape recordings of volunteers will only be used,  if 
the volunteer grants permission through the Audio/Visual  Image Release form . Each volunteer will also be 
asked to grant permission for his/her name [CONTACT_244630]/her photo or video image or in writing 
connected to his/her image.  If a volunteer does not grant permission through the Audio/Visual Image 
Release, then no photos or other visual recordings will be taken of him/her. In the event that it is discovered 
that an individual has been inadvertently photographed or visually recorded without his/her permission, the 
materials will be immediately destroyed.  Permission through the Audio Visual Image Release form will be 
confirmed before any photographs or other visual recordings are used.  
 
C5.  CONFIDENTIALI TY PROCEDURES FOR RESEA RCH RECORDS, DATA, HUMAN BIO LOGICAL 
SPECIM ENS   
 
Complete confidentiality cannot be promised to military participant because information bearing on the 
military participant health may be required to be reported to appropriate medical or command authorities.   
 
All data and medical information obtained will be considered privileged and held in con fidence.  Study 
volunteers will be assigned unique subject identification (ID) numbers that will not contain any personal 
identifiers such as name, social security number, address, date of birth, zip code, etc.  This study subject ID 
number will be used on  all data collection instruments, to include questionnaires, data collection forms, 
computer records, etc. A number will be assigned as each volunteer is medically cleared for participation.  A 
master list linking the volunteers’ names and ID numbers will be kept in a separate locked file in the principal 
investigator's office, or kept in a computer file with password -protected access restricted to the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_30019]. The master list linking subjects with their data will be destr oyed when the 
study is closed. When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information 
will be included that would reveal identity. Study samples will be processed on site at [LOCATION_003]RIEM.  All samples 
will be stored using the  subject identification number.  Samples will be shipped for analysis to Metabolic 
Solutions. Remaining samples will be stored at [LOCATION_003]RIEM in a - 80ºC freezer in room [ADDRESS_810111] ten  years after the study has been 
completed.

       C6.1 Risks of Harm   
 
Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_722] X -ray absorpti ometry (DEXA) scan  
Research Procedure Description:  Volunteer will lay face -up on the DEXA densitometer table in 
shorts, t -shirts, and stocking feet.  Volunteers will be asked to remain motionless for the 8 -10 min 
scan.  
Research- related Risks:  Exposure to less than 0.6 mrem X -irradiation in a slow -speed (up to 
20 minutes) whole- body scan is possible.  This dose is equivalent to approximately 1/500 of 
normal annual background radiation (300 mrem/year), 1/6 of the radiation received in a 
transatlantic flight (3.825 mrem), or 1/[ADDRESS_810113] X -ray (2 mrem). 
The American College of Obstetricians stated that exposure to less than 5 rem (50 mSV) has not 
been associated with an increase in fetal anomalies or pregnancy loss . 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   A quality assurance check will be completed on the DEXA 
each day prior to its use; the software will not allow the use of the DEXA densitometer if the quality 
assurance check fails. Volunteers must be advised that the health effects of very low level exposures 
to ionizing radiation, if any, are unk nown (thought to be minimal).  Pregnant women may not undergo 
this procedure.  Women of child bearing age must have a documented negative pregnancy test within 
the [ADDRESS_810114] becoming pregnant while 
participating in the study.  Study personnel conducting body composition will be credentialed for such 
procedures and listed on the DOA log with code “U.”   
 
Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_610992]:   A needle will be used to guide a catheter into the antecubital 
vein of the volunteer. The catheter will be attached to saline to keep the line patent for multiple blood 
draws.     
Research- related Risks:  The risks of blood sampling are small and usually limited to local br uising 
or swelling.  Also sometimes volunteers feel faint or may faint. If the volunteer has had problems with 
fainting during blood draws in the past, they may be more prone to them during future procedures. If 
the catheter, the tube that is left in the arm after the needle is removed, becomes clogged at any time 
during the protocol, we will have to replace this to conti nue blood sampling. This wil l require another 
needle to be inserted into your arm. In addition, the catheter can cause irritation, bruising, swelling, infection, or an allergic reaction.  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Trained technicians will use sterile techniques to place the 
catheter; however, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_559076] a chance that the site may become infected.  
Subjects wi ll be briefed on the signs and symptoms of potential complications and given information 
on who to contact [CONTACT_610982]/or treatment.  Volunteers should not donate blood for 
eight weeks before or after this study. Credentialed personnel perfor ming venous catheterization will 
be listed on the DOA log with code “T.”   
 
Research Procedure Name: 6,6-[
2H2] glucose infusions  
Research Procedure Description:  6,6-[2H2] glucose will be infused using a indwelling catheter.  
Research- related Risks:  The primary risks associated with tracer studies are those related to 
venous catheterization. The catheter can cause irritation, bruising, or infection. There are no known 
risks or reported side effects associated with administration of 6,6-[2H2] glucose infusions  to humans 
during cl inical or experimental studies.  The risks associated with the infusion include volume 
overload, infection, and allergic reaction to the infused substance.  There have been no occurrences 
of volume overload, no occurrences of infection or allergic reaction attributable to iodine used prior to 
venipuncture in any of the [ADDRESS_810115]  been involved.  To 
minimize the likelihood of these events occurring, infusion rate will be closely monitored and 
maintained at less than 3 0 ml/hr throughout the entire infusion protocol day.  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  All staff who directly participate i n the infusion studies will be 
properly trained how to safely monitor (i.e., infusi on pumps and IV lines) infusion studies from [CONTACT_611001]: Impact of erythropoietin on hematological adaptations and physical performance

Date: HQ [LOCATION_003]MRDC IRB Research Protocol Template v 20September 2018  DO NOT TOUCH FOOTERS (THIS IS OURS AND HEADERS ARE YOURS)                     Page [ADDRESS_810117] . If sign of allergic reaction, 
rash or redness, infusion will be stopped immediately.  Credentialed personnel performing venous 
catheterization will be listed on the DOA log with code “T.”  
 
Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_610993]: A needle will be used for single blood draws of the antecubital 
vein.    
Research- related Risks:  Venipuncture is a routine clinical procedure the medical community 
commonly uses to obtain blood samples. The immediate complications may be slight pain du ring the 
entry of the needle into the skin, possible dizziness, and syncope . Dizziness or syncope constitutes 
no long- term harm, and immediate relief is achieved by [CONTACT_610983]. Additionally, a hem atoma may result from the venipuncture, but this 
is more unsightly than risk producing. Late complications might include thrombosis of the vein due to 
trauma or infection. These complications are extremely rare.  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Particip ant monitoring, aseptic technique, including sterile 
disposable blood collection apparatus and adherence to standard medical precautions reduce risk.  
Trained technicians will perform all venipuncture. Subjects will be briefed on the signs and symptoms of potential complications and given information on who to contact [CONTACT_610982]/or 
treatment. Credentialed personnel performing venipuncture will be listed on the DOA log with code 
“S.”   
 
Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_610994]:   A needle and syringe will be used to inject prescribed EPO 
amounts subcutaneously in the abdomen 3 times a week for 4 weeks.  
Research- related Risks: Side effects with EPO injection are redness and pain at the site of injection, 
increase blood pressure, blood clots, joint pain, nausea, dizziness, headaches, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and 
weight loss.  Rare but possible side effects can include myocardial infarction and stroke  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  To minimize side effects the study will use a low dose EPO 
inject ion equivalent to a pediatric dose. Before participants begin the prescribed exercise they will 
complete a short clinically relevant health questionnaire (Appendix A) and have their vital signs  
(blood pressure, heart rate, and SpO
2) assessed by [CONTACT_464] . Copi[INVESTIGATOR_610946]. H emoglobin and Hct values will 
be measured weekly during EPO injections. To minimize risk of b lood clots Hct values will be 
maintained < 50%. If Hct values increase > 50% EP O injections will be stopped.  Volunteer will return 
to for another Hct check within 3 days.   If hemoglobin increases more than 1 g/dL over a 1  week 
period EPO injections will be stopped and hemoglobin will be reassessed within 3 days.  EPO 
injections will only be administered  by [CONTACT_610984] . The se individual s will follow 
administration procedures provided in the PROCRIT® prescri ber information guide. Volunteers will 
continued to be monitored for 2  weeks after the injections are complete to ensure there are no 
complications from the EPO injections.  The OMSO will be responsible for observing and monitoring 
adverse events of partici pants in this study.  
 
Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_610995]:   Exercise testing will occur on a cycle ergometer  or treadmill.   
Exercise will be  at various levels of intensity based on exercise protocol.  
Research- related Risks:   Exercise per se rarely provokes cardiovascular events in healthy 
individuals with normal cardiovascular systems.  The prevalence of fatal events in the U.S. is approximately 1:133,000 to 1: 185,000 for men and 1:769,000 to 1:1,500,000 for women who are 
competitive high school and college athletes. For middle- aged and older adults the relative risk rises 
to 1:15,000 to 1:18,[ADDRESS_810118] a low risk for cardiac

Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  (Precautions, safeguards):  Studies have confirmed the 
safety of maximal exercise testing, particularly among apparently healthy persons without significant cardiovascular risk factors.  As a precaution, there w ill be at least one spotter during all exercise 
sessions, and heart rate will be monitored in real time during testing.  In addition, exercise monitors 
and test administrators will be CPR -certified.  Study personnel conducting maximal aerobic testing 
and tr eadmill load carriage will similarly be credentialed for such procedures and listed on the DOA 
log with code “V.”    
Research Procedure Name: [CONTACT_610996]: A small incision will be made  in the skin and fascia of the vastus 
lateralis. A [ADDRESS_810121] muscle samples, while the volunteer is under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine or 
similar  local anesthetic  analogue in dosages and composition approved by [CONTACT_244606] ). 
Research- related Risks: Percutaneous needle muscle biopsies have been established as a non-
routine, but safe research procedure. Similar to blood draws, there is a risk that volunteers will feel 
faint or may faint right after a muscle biopsy. If the volunteer has had problems with fainting during 
blood draws or muscle biopsies in the past, they may be more prone to them during future procedures. The most common risks associated with muscle biopsies are  pain (~1.27%), erythema 
(~1.27%), and ecchymosis (1.27%) (48, 49) . Panic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], bleeding, and edema have also been 
reported (0.21%, 0.42%, and 0.84%, respectively) (48) . Denervation, numbness, and atrophy may 
occur but have not been verified in the literature. Some minimal scarring will accompany healing of 
the inc ision and formation of a hypertrophic scar or keloid is possible. Although this is a rare event in 
fair-skinned persons, the incidence of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation associated with 
healing of a primarily closed skin biopsy site (i.e., one which was closed with sutures immediately 
afterward) is 5 -10% in dark -skinned persons.  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Lidocaine (or similar anesthetic) will be used  to minimize 
pain or discomfort. Potential risk for complications of bleeding will be reduced by [CONTACT_610985]. If soreness symptoms should occur, they usually do not 
interfere with normal walking or heavier exe rcise. Volunteers with evidence of bleeding diathesis 
should be excluded during medical clearance; those with local skin infection or irritation or recent use of anticoagulant medication not identified during initial medical screening (including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) w ill be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_610947]. Volunteers will be instructed about precautions 
against hematoma and infection. Volunteers will refrain from non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
medications for 10 days before and 5 days after the muscle bi opsies. They will be given a handout 
outlining instructions for proper care of the incision site (Appendix C ). Muscle biopsies will be 
performed using sterile procedures and equipment by [CONTACT_610986]’s Percutaneous Skeletal Muscle 
Biopsy SOP (OMSO -approved [LOCATION_003]RIEM SOP for Invasive Procedures, Chapter 10) of [ADDRESS_810122] -biopsy to monitor for any sign of infection, 
bleeding, or hematoma.  Study personnel conducting muscle biopsies will be credentialed for such 
procedures and listed on the DOA log with code “R.”   
 
Research Procedure Name: [CONTACT_610997] (or similar) Injection  
Research Procedure Description:  Approximately 8- 10 mL of 1% l idocaine (or similar local 
anesthetic analogue in dosages and composition approved by [CONTACT_244606] ) will be injected using a 25 g 
needle at the site of the incision, superficially (i.e., skin) and within the vastus lateralis.  
Research- related Risks:  Slight pain at the site of injection might occur. Although rare, anaphylactic 
reactions may also occur following administration of lidocaine (or similar). Unlikely, but possible side

heartbeat.  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: Volunteers will be screened for  all allergies during the initial 
general medical clearance. Volunteers will be instructed to notify a Study Investigator or any staff member immediately if an allergic (i.e., swelling, itching, rash, hives, difficulty swallowing, or difficulty 
breathing) reaction occurs. In the case of severe reaction, OMSO will be notified immediately and 
lidocaine (or similar) use will be discontinued and if indicated emergency medical staff will be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. In the event of an extremely severe reaction, an Epi[INVESTIGATOR_510177] -Injector will be available 
onsite.  Only credentialed PIs will administer the lidocaine (or similar), and medical staff will be on 
duty.  
 
Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_610998] -rebreathing 
Research Procedure Description:  CO-rebreathing has been safely used to assess Hbmass for over 
100 years. In this procedure the volunteer will inhale a bolus of CO (99.99% ,; men: 1.0 ml/kg body 
mass; women: 0.8 ml/kg body mass; if body mass index is > 30 kg/m2 convert body mass to BMI of 
25 kg/m2) followed with 2 minute rebreathing 100% oxygen (from a 3L bag) using a closed circuit 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (Spi[CONTACT_3252]- CO Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]- Applikator, Blood Tec, [LOCATION_013] or similar). Arterialized capi[INVESTIGATOR_117808] (finger -tip) will be collected at the beginning of the rebreathing procedure and after seven 
minutes of the initial CO inhalation to assess blood %HbCO. Sodalime will be used to prevent 
accumulation of CO 2.   
Research- related Risks : Minor risk of performing the optimized CO -rebreathing procedure include 
headache (extremely rare). Additionally, finger -sticks may result in pain, dizziness, fainting, infection, 
bruising, tenderness, and/or edema at puncture site, skin irritation, nausea and vomiting. It is unknown what potential risks might be present for pregnant women, so those who ar e pregnant will 
be excluded from participation.  
Measures to Minimize Risk of Harm (Precautions, safeguards) : This method uses a small, 
quantified volume of CO aimed at increasing the %HbCO by 4 -7% above baseline. CO -rebreathing 
will not be performed if baseline %HbCO is >3%, thus reducing the likelihood of headache. Additionally, only one CO -rebreathing procedure will be completed per day. Study staff will also 
monitor volunteers. Finger capi[INVESTIGATOR_610948]. Risk of fainting or dizziness will be minimized by [CONTACT_610987]/fingersticks. Female volunteers will self -administer a pregnancy 
test prior to undergoi ng CO rebreathing test s. 
 
      C6.2  Incidental or Unexpected Findings  
 
Health problems identified during the screening process will be documented and a copy provided to 
the volunteer. The volunteer will be encouraged to make an appointment with their primary care 
provider for a full evaluation of the problem. Volunteers with evidence of any physical, mental, and/or 
medical conditions that would mak e the proposed studies relatively more hazardous will be excluded.

 Measure the dimensions thickness, length, and width if possible (ex., baked potato—4" x 3").   
 
 Use your hand:  F ist = 1 cup, Palm of hand = 3oz meat, Golf ball = 2 Tablespoon.  
 
Helpful Hint:  It’s easier, and your food record will be more accurate, if you write everything down as it is 
happening.  Don’t wait until the end of the day to record everything , because you’ll forget the specifics.

Version date: [ADDRESS_810145] 2018  Appendix D : Muscle Biopsy Care  
 
Muscle Biopsy Care  
Information for the Participant  
 
You have just had a percutaneous muscle biopsy. The muscle biopsy site is closed with 
a steri -strip. This is covered with 4 x 4 gauze pad, a transparent dressing to prevent the 
incision from getting wet, and an elastic ACE bandage.  
 
As the anesthetic wears  off, you may feel a dull ache at the biopsy site for ~1- [ADDRESS_810146] no pain at all. Instructions for the care of the biopsy site are as 
follows:  
 
1. You may perform all your normal activities immediately after the biopsy, including 
light exercis e. 
 
2. Leave the ACE bandage in place for 5 hours after the biopsy. After this time, 
remove the elastic bandage. The following morning, the biopsy site will be examined by [CONTACT_26848] [INVESTIGATOR_610963] ([LOCATION_003]RIEM) Office of Medical Support and Oversight 
(OMSO). The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_610964].  
 
3. An appointment will be scheduled with OMSO within 3 d of your procedure to 
ensure proper healing.  
 
4. Do not take any aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8427]- containing products for 5 days after the biopsy 
unless the OMSO MD/PA approves. Also avoid ‘aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]- like’ drugs such as 
Motrin, Indocin, etc. Tylenol is OK.  
 
5. After [ADDRESS_810147] the study principal investigator:  
 
– Fever  
– Bleeding from biopsy site 
– Inflammation at biopsy site (warmth, redness, tenderness, pus formation, clear discharge, opening of incision, lump under incision, or rash around incision)  
– If you are not sure if it is healing normally, alert the study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_610965]  
– Persistent numbness in the leg  
– Pain at the biopsy site more than one week after the biopsy

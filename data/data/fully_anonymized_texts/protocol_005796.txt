1. Summary
A common problem associated with sleep studies (polysomnogram o r PSGs) is “first night effect” (FNE), with
disruption of sleep, resulting in insufficient time to make a d iagnosis or achieve effective therapy 1. Current
practice is to prescribe sleep aids or sleep medications to pre vent FNE. Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (Ambien) is the most
commonly prescribed medication, but has several significant sid e effects, limiting its usefulness 2. Hence, it is
important to find an alternative that is safer, more acceptable  and personable to patients. In this study we
propose to prospectively evaluate sleep related outcomes with l avender aromatherapy compared to those with
pre-medication prior to diagnostic or split night polysomnograp hy (PSG).
2. Study aims
Overall Objective: To determine if lavender aromathera py is as effective as pre-presc ribed zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_549575], and reducing the need for repeating PSGs  for a diagnostic or split night sleep study.
Primary Outcome : 
xSleep efficiency
Secondary Outcomes : 
xA successful split night PSG or a diagnostic PSG and wake after  sleep onset (WASO)
Exploratory Outcomes: 
xTotal sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency, REM sleep onset la tency, Stage 3/[ADDRESS_719374] sleep 1. This reduced sleep quality is probably due to multiple factor s:
discomfort caused by [CONTACT_174442],  limitation of movements, and t he unfamiliar environment of the sleep
laboratory. To improve recordings, the sleep lab offers individ ualization of the environment such as controlling
temperature, personal pi[INVESTIGATOR_549576]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_549577], there is a percentage of studies
reported (33-46%) that result in the need to either repeat the study or have the patient return to the lab for
titrating study 2,3. This results in increased cost as well as poorer patient expe rience 4.  Pre-medication with non-
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_549578] 2,3, however with side effects such
as falls and post-study confusion, it is important to find an a lternative that is safer, more acceptable and
personable to patients 5.
Aromatherapy encompasses the therapeutic use of aromatic essent ial oils. These are ‘non-oily, highly fragrant
essences extracted from plants by [CONTACT_549587], which evaporate  readily’ 6. Essential oils are usually presented as
massage oils or lotions, in herb al packets under a pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356], or i n an ambient vapor machine. The mechanisms by
[CONTACT_549588]: olfaction, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] a bsorption and/or ingestion through the oral cavity
7. Jimbo et al, proposes the action of aromatherapy begins from a  smell molecule combined with a receptor
particular to each specific odor 8.  The smell molecule passes along the nasal cavity and adheres  to the olfactory
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  The stimulus is then transmitted from the olfactor y bulb to the higher sensory centers in the
cerebral cortex 9
Lavender ( Lavender angustifolia ) aromatherapy has a long history of being commonly used for pr omoting sleep 
10-[ADDRESS_719375] sleep, % sleep tim e, along with gender differentiated effects
on stage 2, REM sleep and wake after sleep onset latency 18.  In addition, the prospective study conducted by [CONTACT_549589],  showed an improvement of total sleep by 42
Version: ϭϮͬϯϭͬϮϬϭϵ  2 minutes and increase in sleep e fficiency by 6.31% with lavender  19 (manuscript submitted).  In this study, we 
hypothesize that lavender will improve sleep quality and reduce  the need for repeat PSGs, as effectively as 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730].  
Aromatherapy is currently being utilized in many Regions Hospit al departments with a positive patient response 
and experience.  In addition, the study conducted by [CONTACT_549590][INVESTIGATOR_549579]; patients that chose aromatherapy report better patient 
satisfaction scores in regard to the control of pain.  In line with the triple aim, we think that this study will 
provide an opportunity to reduce total cost of care by [CONTACT_549591] 
(affordability ), resulting in earlier initiation of treatment ( health ), with improved patient experience 
(experience ). In addition, lavender provides a better safety profile than any sedatives that are currently being 
used for diagnostic sleep studies.  
4. Approach
a. Study design
We propose to do a pragmatic clinical study by [CONTACT_549592] t sleep study (PSG).  The overal l goal for this study is to show that lavender
is as effective as Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (non-inferiority analysis) with reg ard to improvement of sleep quality and
usability of diagnostic PSGs with sleep efficiency as the prima ry outcome.
b. Population
Briefly, we will use a convenienc e sample (non-random selection ) to recruit patients (refer to pre-screen
form for recruiting patients). We plan to enroll about 144 pati ents, 120 who were prescribed sleep
medications and 24 who agree to use lavender aromatherapy. Stud y would be considered complete if
the enrollment was 24 or more in both groups. Patients who are not prescribed any sleep
medication/aids or chose not to use them, will be offered laven der aromatherapy as an alternative. The
sleep aids are prescribed by [CONTACT_549593].  We will con sent both patients who are prescribed/use
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_549580]/night sleep study and  those that chose lavender. At the
Maplewood center, there are 45-50 sleep studies scheduled per w eek. We estimate that there are 15-20
patients per week that are eligible for the study.
Inclusion Criteria
xAge >=18 years
xIn-center diagnostic or split night sleep study (PSG)
c. Data collection process
i. Process steps for identification of patients or records
Refer to Figure 1. Briefly, when the patient checks in for the sleep study, the research team
reviews the chart to identify if  the patient is potentially eli gible for the study. The pre-screen
algorithm will be used.  The pati ents can qualify for the study
i. If the patient is prescribed zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730] (Ambien) by [CONTACT_549594]. If the patient has not been prescribed any sleep aid.
ii. Recruitment
Refer to Figure 1If the patient is eligible;
xscenario (i), they will be offere d to participate in the study  as part of the zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_549581] (ii), they will be offered to participate in the study  as part of the Lavender group.
Version: [12/5/16] 3 In either scenarios, the patient will be consented. Consent wil l be collected from both groups to 
ensure we can use their sleep study results.

Table 1: Terms and Definitions – for Sleep Study 
Term Definitions 
Total Recording Time 
(TRT) Total amount of time during which the patient is in bed with re cording equipment 
activated 
Total Sleep Time (TST) Total amount of sleep time scored  during the total recording ti me; includes time from 
sleep onset to sleep offset and is distributed throughout the s leep time as minutes of 
Stage N1 sleep, Stage N2 sleep, Stage N3, and rapid eye movemen t (REM) sleep. 
Sleep efficiency Refers to percentage of total time in bed actually spent in sle ep. It is calculated as sum of 
Stage N1, Stage N2, Stage N3, and REM sleep, divided by [CONTACT_549595] 100
Sleep Latency Time in minutes from ‘lights off’ that marks the starting of to tal recording time to the first 
epoch scored as sleep 
Wake after Sleep Onset 
(WASO) Periods of wakefulness occurring after defined sleep onset 
Apnea-Hypopnea Index Number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. 
Total Arousals # of transient phenomenon that may lead to wakefulness or only briefly interrupt sleep
Arousal index Total number of arousals x 60/TST (min) 
Sleep R Latency Rapid eye movement latency is the time from the sleep onset to the first epoch of REM 
sleep 
N1 Time Stage N1 Sleep Time 
N2 Time Stage N2 Sleep Time 
N3 Time Stage N3 Sleep Time 
REM Time Stage REM Sleep Time 
% N1 Minutes of N1 sleep stage × 100/TST 

Version:ϭϮͬϯϭͬϮϬϭϵ  4 % N2 Minutes of N2 sleep stage × 100/TST 
% N3 Minutes of N3 sleep stage × 100/TST 
% REM Minutes of REM sleep stage × 100/TST 
Limb Movements Repetitive limb movements that may disrupt sleep 
Lights On Time that recording of sleep is terminated 
Lights Off Time at which the patient is allowed to fall asleep and marks t he start of data that will be 
staged and analyzed. 
iv. Process steps for data acquisition
At this visit, study staff will review the consent form with th e patient. All of their questions will
be answered and they will be asked  to demonstrate their underst anding of participation. If they
would like to participate, they will sign the consent form. As scheduled, the patient will undergo
all the scheduled standard procedures for the diagnostic/split night study. Data will be extracted
and entered into REDCap by [CONTACT_5984]. No data outside of standard of care will be
collected.
d. Intervention, treatments
Intervention: Aromatherapy with Lavender using a diffuser. To be eligible for this intervention, the
participant should not be prescr ibed any sleep aid. We will be using commercially available lavender
essential oil and diffusers. Th e study staff will fill the diff user with water sufficient to run for about two
hours and recommended drops of oil will be added about 10 min b efore the lights are turned off. The
diffusers automatically turn off (mode – two hour shut off) whe n the water level falls below trigger in
about two hours.
Comparator: Oral Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730].  To be eligible for this group, the participant was prescribed zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_549582], i.e., pre-prescribed physi cian-directed use of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]. For this
group, the subjects will take the prescribed medication prior t o the sleep study, as directed by [CONTACT_51329].
Consent will be collected from both groups to ensure we can use  their sleep study results.
e. Outcomes/endpoint and other variable definitions, and instrum ents used
Sleep Efficiency:  Refers to percentage of total time in bed actually spent in sl eep. It is calculated as sum
of Stage N1, Stage N2,  Stage N3, and REM sleep, divided by [CONTACT_549596] d multiplied by 100
A successful split night PSG or a diagnostic PSG:  Is a binary outcome (yes/no) based on chart review. The
outcome will be inferred from documentation in the chart either  in notes or PSG report showing a
successful split night or if a diagnosis is made or if a repeat  PSG is ordered.
Wake after sleep onset (WASO):  Periods of wakefulness occurring after defined sleep onset
Side effects:  For both the interventions, th e side effects w ill be inferred from post sleep study
questionnaire. The side effects will be described and compi[INVESTIGATOR_255466] a binary outcome (yes/no). This will be
used to report the safety profile of the two interventions as a n exploratory outcome.
Please refer to attached data dictionary for details.
f. Statistical analysis plan
Outcome measures will be graphed  and visually assessed to deter mine if the planned analyses are
appropriate for the distribution of the outcomes. Descriptive s tatistics (means, standard deviations,
Version: ϭϮͬϯϭͬϮϬϭϵ  5 frequencies, etc.) will be calcula ted overall and by [CONTACT_549597]. We 
will then compare these characteristics between the two groups using t-tests, Wilcoxon, chi-square, and 
Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate. Missing data will be cons idered to be missing at random and those 
subjects will be excluded from analysis. If a large proportion of data is missing (>10%), we will compare 
baseline characteristics between  subjects with missing and non- missing data. No adjustment for 
multiple comparisons will be done.  
All statistical analyses will be p erformed in SAS Version 9.4. This analysis plan was written by [CONTACT_549598]. 
Primary Outcomes :  
Non-inferiority of sleep efficacy when using lavender versus zo lpi[INVESTIGATOR_549583] a one-sided, 
two-sample t-test. A noninferiority margin of 6% will be used f or sleep efficiency (see power calculation 
for justification). The null hypo thesis of inequality (differen ce is greater than or equal to 6%) is rejected 
in favor of the alternative hypothesis of equality (difference is less than margin) if the 1-sided p-value is 
less than 0.025. Due to the infl ated probability of a type 1 er ror with unequal sample sizes, we will 
perform a sensitivity analysis in which a random sample of 24 a ctive control participants will be 
compared to the lavender group. 
Secondary Outcomes :  
The secondary outcomes, rate of successful split night PSG and wake after sleep onset (WASO) latency 
will be analyzed similarly to the primary outcome. The noninfer iority margins for successful split night 
PSG and WASO are 13.5% and 16 mi nutes, respectively, and are ba sed on data from the three Lettieri 
studies2,3,20. 
Exploratory Outcomes:  
This is a descriptive aim. All v alues will be summarized using means and standard deviations or 
frequencies and percentages, as appropriate.  
g. Power analysis or statement of precision
We reviewed 3 previous studies by [CONTACT_549599]2,3,20 in which the pooled average sleep efficiency was 88.3%
for treatment groups versus 79.0%  for controls. The absolute de fference in sleep efficiency was 9.3% (CI:
6% - 12.3%). We, therefore, will define the lower bound of our confidence interval, 6%, as the operative
noninferiority margin.
It is estimated based on clinical experience that five times as  many people have a sleep aid prescription
upon arrival to the sleep clinic. This was accounted for in the  power calculation. Therefore, group sizes
of 24 (treatment) and 120 (control) achieve 80% power to detect  non-inferirority using a one-sided two-
sample t-test. The noninferiority margin is 6%, the true differ ence between the means is assumed to be
0, the alpha level is 2.5% and the data are assumed to be drawn  from populations with standard
deviations of 8.[ADDRESS_719376] of the Difference of Two Means
function in PASS.
h. Strengths and limitations
There is potential for bias due to non-randomized nature of stu dy. We will compare baseline
characteristics to determine if the groups are inherently diffe rent.

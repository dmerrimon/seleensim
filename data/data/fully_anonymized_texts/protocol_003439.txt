ASP2215Phase of Development:
Phase 1/2
Title of Study:
A Phase 1/2Open -label Rollover Study for Subjects Who Have Participated in an Astellas Sponsored 
ASP2215 Trial
Planned Study Period:
From 3Q2015to 3Q2023
Study period implies the period from the first screened subject at the first site until the last scheduled 
visit of the last subject in the study.
Study Objective(s):
The purpose of the study is to provide access to continued treatment for subjects who participated in 
other Astellas sponsored ASP2215 (single agent) trials and for whom the Investigator feels the subject 
may benefit from continued treatment.
Planned Total Number of Study Centers and Location(s):
Sites that currently have subjects actively participating in an Astellas sponsored ASP2215 trial.
North America, Europe, Asia
Study Population:
Subjects who are actively participating in an Astellas sponsored ASP2215 trial that has completed the 
primary analysis, whom the investigator feels may have potential to continue to derive clinical benefit 
from the treatment with ASP2215, and who did not m eet any of the study discontinuation criteria in 
the present study.
Number of Subject s to be Enrolled / Randomized:
Dependent on the number of subjects enrolled in the protocols rolling over into this trial.
Study Design Overview:
This is a multi -center, open -label, rollover protocol for Astellas sponsored, single agent ASP2215 
trials in AML and advanced solid tumors.  Subjects must have completed the protocol requirements of 
the previous ASP2215 trial and be actively participating in the previous ASP2215 trial.  In addition, 
subjects must be continuing to derive clinical benefit from treatment with ASP2215 without any 
persistent intolerable toxicity from ASP2215, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_255123] p rior to being enrolled.
Subjects should sign the informed consent at their cycle [ADDRESS_310044] will then 
receive ASP2215 study d rug for the rollover study and return all ASP2215 study drug from the parent 
study.

Version 2. 1Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 1 1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
ASP2215 hemifumarate (gilteritinib) ,is a new chemical entity discovered by  [CONTACT_255137]. in collaboration with Kotobuki Pharmaceutical Co., L td.  It is a FMS -like ty rosine kinase 
3(FLT3 )inhibitor under development for the treatment of acute m yeloid leukemia (AML).  
ASP2215 also has inhibitory  activities fo r AXL tyrosine kinase (AXL) , leukocy te receptor 
tyrosine kinase (LTK) and anaplastic l ymphoma kinase ( ALK).
FLT3 is a member of the class III receptor t yrosine kinase famil y that is normally expressed 
on the surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells. FLT3 and its ligand play  an important role in
proliferation, survival and differentiation of multipotent stem cells.  FLT3 is over expressed in 
the majority  of AML cases . In addition, a ctivat edFLT3 with an internal tandem duplication
(ITD) in and around the juxtamembrane domain and ty rosine kinase domain (TKD )mutations
at around D835 in the activation loop are present in 28% to 34% and 11% to 14% of AML 
cases , respectivel y[Schlenk & Döhner, 2009 ].  These activated mutations in FLT3 are 
oncogenic and show transforming activity  in cells [Yamamoto et al, 2001] .  Furthermore, 
patients with activated FLT3 show poor prognosis , with a higher relapse rate, more rapid 
relapse, reduced disease -free survival and overall survival [ Patel et al, 2012 ; Gale et al, 2008 ; 
Yanada et al, 2005 ; Moreno et al, 2003 ].
ALK is another receptor ty rosine kinase; this molecule appears to play  a role in the
development of the nervous sy stem, although the mechanisms remain poorly  understood 
[Camidge & Doebele, 2012].  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC )with ALK gene 
arrangements represents approximately  4% to 5% of all NSCL C patients in both Caucasians 
and Asians . In absence of treatment with a targeted agent, ALK gene arrangements are 
associated with a poorer clinical outco me[Chia et al, 2014].  Over [ADDRESS_310050] common ALK fusion is echinoderm microtubule 
associated protein like 4 (EML 4)-ALK, representing 29% to 33% of gene fusions identified 
[Chia et al, 2014].  EML4 -ALK dem onstrated transforming activities in vitro and in vivo, 
confirming its oncogenic properties [Soda et al , 2007].
Nonclinical data suggest that AXL overexpression mediates resistance to epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] (EGFR) ty rosine kinase inhibitor sin NSCL C with an EGFR activating 
mutation and that AXL  inhibition can restore sensitivity  to EGFR ty rosine kinase inhibitor s.  
Nonclinical data also suggest that in some cases, overexpression of growth arrest -specific 
6(GAS6 ; the ligand for AXL) can prom ote AXL activation in the setting of acquired 
resistance in the absence of AXL overexpression [Zhang et al, 2012]. The incidence of AXL 
or GAS6 overexpression in advanced NSCL C has not been extensively  characterized.  In 
35matched EGFR -mutant NSCL C specim ens obtained from patients both before treatment 
with erlotinib or gefit inib and after the development of resistance, increased (2 -fold or 
greater) expression of AXL  was observed in 7 of 35 (20%) specimens and GAS6 in 7 of 28 
(25%) specimens [Zhang et al, 2012].

Brochure.
1.2.1 Nonclinical Data
ASP2215 inhibi ted activities of FLT3, n ucleophosmin -1 gene -ALK, LTK, ALK and AXL 
kinases at 1 and 5 nmol/L and t ropomy osin receptor kinase A, ROS, RET and MER kinases 
at 5 nmol/L  by [CONTACT_46431] 50%. ASP2215 inhibited FL T3, echinoderm microtubule -associated 
protein -like 4 -ALK v ariant 1 and KIT kinase activities with the half maximal inhibitory  
concentration (IC 50) values of 0.291, 1.2 and 229 nmol/L , respectivel y.
ASP2215 inhibited each radioligand binding to adenosine A1 receptor (rat), serotonin 
5-hydroxy tryptamine receptor 1 (5HT 1R) (nonselective, rat), serotonin 5 -hydroxytryptamine 
receptor 2B (5HT 2BR) (human) and sigma receptor (nonselective, guinea pig) with I C50
values of 4.57, 4.90, 0.190 and 0.615 μmol/L , respectivel y.
ASP2215 inhibited human 5HT 2BR function in a cell fu nction assay  with an I C50value of 
5.82 μmol/L  without showing agonistic activity .
ASP2215 inhibited the cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3 -ITD, FLT3 -D835Y and 
FLT3 -ITD-D835Y with IC 50values of 1.8, 1.6 and 2.1 nmol/L , respectivel y. ASP2215 
inhibi ted the growth of MV4 -11 cells with IC 50value of 0.92 nmol/L . In MV4 -11 cells, 
treatment of ASP2215 at 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 nmol/L  resulted in FLT3 phosphory lation of 100%, 
86%, 19% and 7%, respectively .
ASP2215 induced significant growth inhibition of MV4 -11tumors and tumor regression in 
vivo.  Further, ASP2215 at 6 and 10 mg/kg per day induced complete tumor regression for 
4and [ADDRESS_310052] 
KIT kinase, and neutropenia was not observed in the tox icity studies in rats and dogs.
In Caco -2 cells, the permeability  of ASP2215 was between that of known low and high 
permeability  markers . ASP2215 was a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but not a substrate 
forbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP ), organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 or organic cation transporter (OCT) 1. ASP2215 demonstrated a 
potential to inhibit BCRP and MATE1 at clinicall y relevant concentrations of ASP2215.
No major human -specific ASP2215 metabolites were formed by  [CONTACT_255138]. The main enzy me involved in the metabolism of ASP2215 was estimated to be 
cytochromeP450 (CYP ) 3A4. ASP2215 has a potential to induce CYP enzy me activities 
(CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5) and mRNA levels

Version 2. 1Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 1 (CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) .  However, these results should be interpreted 
with caution because these effects were not uniformly  observed in all donor samples and the 
concentration -dependency  of these effects could not be evaluated .  For CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 inhibition, I C50values were > 100 μmol/L . Very  weak 
direct inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP3A was observed .  Overall, ASP2215 showed 
minimal direct inhibition of CYP enzy mes at clinically  relevant concentration s.
1.2.2 Clinical Data
[IP_ADDRESS] Studies Using Human Biomaterials
No human -specific ASP2215 metabolites were formed by  [CONTACT_255139], 
with the exception of 1 minor metabolite detected in human hepatocy tes. ASP2215 is a 
substrate for CYP3A4 and P -gpbut n ot a substrate for human BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 
or OCT1. The IC 50values of inhibition to drug transport by  P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OCT1, 
OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2 -K inhibition are > 30, 1.41, 29.4, 2.92, 34.9, 0.0543 and 
47.7 μmol/L , respectively .
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged drug after single and multiple dosing of 
ASP2215 to AML  subjects were investigated in the dose escalation cohort of 
Study 2215 -CL-0101. Assessment of observed trough concentr ation (C trough ) over time for 
individual subjects (both dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts) showed that in most 
subjects, the trough concentration of ASP2215 appeared to reach stead y state b y day [ADDRESS_310053] of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor 
(voriconazole) on the pharmacokinetics of ASP2215 was investigated as a part of 
Study 2215 -CL-0101. Since a substantial number of subjects in Study  2215-CL-0101 
required coadministration of strong (voriconazole and posaconazole) or moderate 
(fluconazole) CYP3A4 inhibitors during the course of treatment, C trough /dose values of these 
subjects were compared with subjects that did not receive CYP3A4 inhibi tors. Overall, these 
data suggest a low probability  for increased exposure of ASP2215 by  [CONTACT_255140]3A4 inhibitors.
Plasma inhibitory  assay  (PIA) from the samples collected predose and postdose on day s 1, 8, 
15 and 29 demonstrated sustained inhi bition of phospho -FLT3 at doses 80 mg and higher.
Evaluation of time matched ASP2215 plasma concentrations Fridericia -corrected QT interval 
corrected relative to baseline (ΔQTcF) was performed. Comparison of time matched 
ASP2215 plasma concentrations with ΔQTcF values showed no substantial relationship, 
although a positive trend was observed.  Overall these data indicate a low probability  of a 
substantial increase in ΔQTcF over the range of ASP2215 plasma concentrations evaluated 
(20 to 300 mg).

Version 2. 1Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 1 With incr easing dose of ASP2215, increasing plasma concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) 
were observed. Comparison of day  matched CK corrected relative to baseline with C trough 
ASP2215 values showed a correlation with a positive slope.  Similarly , comparison of th e 
Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade for CK elevations with 
ASP2215 C trough values showed increasing incidence of higher CTCAE grades with 
increasing drug exposure.  Overall, increasing CK plasma concentrations from baseline 
appea red to correlate with increasing ASP2215 plasma concentrations; the mechanism for 
this effect is unknown.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy
In Stud y 2215 -CL-0101, as of 02Feb2015, 154 subjects were evaluable for response. The 
response assessments were done based on centra l laboratory  evaluation of bone marrow 
samples supplemented with local results when the central results were not available (derived 
response).
Based on the derived response at end of treatment in the 154 subjects (both FLT3 -mutation 
positive and negative) who received at least 1 dose of ASP2215, 41 (26.6%) subjects achieved 
composite complete remission (CRc), and the best overall response rate (CRc + PR) was 35.7%.
Nearl y all subjects that achieved a derived response of partial remission (PR) or CRc at the 
end of treatment were FLT3 -mutation positive. Based on the derived response in the 98 
FLT3 -mutation positive subjects at the end of treatment, 36 (36.7%) subjects achieved CRc, 
and the best overall response rate was 49.0%. Five (5.1%) subjects achieved com plete 
remission (CR), 3 (3.1%) subjects achieved c ompleteremission with incompleteplatelet
recovery (CRp), 28 (28.6%) subjects achieved c ompleteremission with incomplete
hematologic recovery (CRi) and 12 (12.2%) subjects achieved PR .
CRc rates for 80, 120 and 200 mg dose groups were 41.7%, 48.6% and 45.8% respectively .   
Among the 77 FLT3 -mutation positive subjects in the 80 mg, 120 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 
450 mg dose groups, 34 (44.2%) had achieved CRc as the derived response at the end of 
treatment and the overall response rate was 55.8%. Four (5.2%) subjects achieved CR, 
3(3.9%) subjects achieved CRp, 27 (35.1%) subjects achieved CRi and 9 (11.7%) subjects 
achieved PR
Based on the derived response in the 47 FLT3 -mutation negative subjects at the end o f 
treatment, 2 (4.3%) subjects achieved CRc, and the best overall response rate was 8.5%.  
Two (4.3%) subjects each achieved CRi and PR.

Version 2. 1Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 1 ASP2215 showed no effects on the central nervous sy stem in rats at 10 mg/kg.  At 30 mg/kg 
and higher, decreased urination was noted.  In addition, at 100 mg/kg, decreased defecation 
was noted.  The changes in urination and defe cation resolved in the recovery  period.
ASP2215 did not show any  effect on the cardiovascular or respi[INVESTIGATOR_255124] 
100 mg/kg or on the central nervous s ystem at 1 mg/kg. At 3 mg/kg and higher, the following 
signs were noted: retching at 3 mg/kg, vomiting and positive fecal occult blood at 10 mg/kg 
and higher, a decrease in the blood calcium (Ca+2) concentration at 30 mg/kg and salivation 
and an increase followed by  a decrease in the blood Ca+2concentration at 100 mg/kg.  All of 
the finding s recovered.
In the single oral dose toxicity  study  in rats, the approximate lethal dose level was 300 mg/kg 
for males and females. The major change was a gastrointestinal hemorrhagic disorder at 
100and 300 mg/kg. Reversibility  of the changes noted in the surviving animals was seen.  
No definitive single oral dose toxicity  study  in dogs was conducted. In the 4 -week toxicity  
study  in dogs, a dose of 1000 mg/kg per day  caused deaths and moribund sacrifices on day  2.  
The cause of death and moribundity  was co nsidered to be deterioration of general condition 
caused b y gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  
In the 1 -week oral repeated dose toxicity  study  in rats, interstitial pneumonia in the lung and 
vacuolar change in the rod -cone lay er of the retina were observed in a male at 30 mg/kg per 
day.  In the 13 -week oral repeated dose toxicity  study  in rats, deaths occurred at 20 mg/kg per 
day in both sexes. Target organ toxicity  was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, immune 
system, hematopoietic s ystem, eye, lung, ki dney  and liver. The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAE L) was lower than 2.5 mg/kg per day for males and females. The changes noted 
during the dosing period recovered or tended to recover during the 4 -week recovery  period.  
In the 4 -week oral repeated d ose study  in dogs, mortality  occurred at 10 mg/kg per day  or 
more.  Target organ toxicity  was identified in the gastrointestinal tract, immune sy stem, 
hematopoietic sy stem, eye, kidney  and liver. The NOAEL was 1 mg/kg per day  for males and 
females. Reversi bility  of most of the test article related changes was indicated by  [CONTACT_255141] 4 -week recovery  period. I n the 13 -week oral repeated dose study  in dogs, mortalit y 
occurred at 5 mg/kg per day . Target organ toxicity  was identified in the lung, lacrimal gl and, 
urinary  bladder, epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125], gastrointestinal tract, immune s ystem, hematopoietic 
system, ey e, kidney  and liver. The NOAEL was 1 mg/kg per day  for males and females.  
Reversibility  of most of the test article -related changes was indicated b y the end of the 
4-week recovery  period.
ASP2215 did not induce gene mutation in the definitive in vitro reversion test in bacteria.  
Similarly , ASP2215 did not induce chromosomal aberrations in the definitive in vitro 
chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells. The definitive in vivo micronucleus test 
showed that ASP2215 has a potential to induce micronuclei in mice. Based on the results of 
the battery  of genotoxicity  studies above, it was concluded that ASP2215 has a potential to 
induce genotoxicity  in vi vo.

1.3.[ADDRESS_310055] 154 subjects that received ASP2215, 147 (95.5%) developed at least one 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) during the stud y.Overall, the most frequently  
reported TEAEs (occurring in at least 10% of subjects) include febrile neutropenia (34.4%), 
anemia (27.9%), fatigue (26.6%), diarrhea (26.0%), peripheral edema (20.8%), increased 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (19.5%), d yspnea (18.2%), dizziness (16.9%), epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]

include fatigue (13.6%), diarrhea (10.4%), anemia, constipation (9.1% each), increased AST 
(8.4%), nausea, peripheral edema, decreased platelet count (7.8% each), dizziness (7.1%), 
thromb ocytopenia, vomiting (6.5% each) and increased ALT (5.8%).
A total of 112 (72.7%) of the subjects developed at least one serious TEAE. The most 
commonly  reported serious TEAE (occurring in at least 5% of subjects) include febrile 
neutropenia (27.3%), sep sis (13.0%), AML (9.7%), pneumonia (6.5%), h ypotension (5.8%), 
and diarrhea (5.2%). Of the serious TEAEs, 31 (20.1%) subjects had serious TEAEs that 
were considered b y the Investigators to be at least possibly  related to ASP2215. Drug -related 
serious TEAEs that occurred in 2 more subjects include febrile neutropenia (1.9%), diarrhea 
and abnormal liver function test (1.3% each).
Forty subjects experienced a TEAE that resulted in death. One event of intracranial 
hemorrhage, 1 event of septic shock, and the ev ent of hemopty sis were considered possibly  
related to ASP2215 by  [CONTACT_737]. One event of respi[INVESTIGATOR_255126] y related to ASP2215 by  [CONTACT_737]. One event of 
bacteremia was recorded a s grade 3 with a fatal outcome and was considered possibly  related

Additionally , [ADDRESS_310059] in the 300 mg dose group. Both SAEs were considered DLTs.
For CK, 21 (13. 7%) subjects experienced a shift of 2 grades or higher, and these shifts

of [ADDRESS_310060], 19 (12. 4%) subjects experienced a shift of 2 grades or higher.
Sixteen subjects experienced dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs); 14 subjects in the dose 
expansion cohort (1 in 20 mg dose group, 1 in 40 mg dose group, 2 in 80 mg dose group, 3 in 
120 mg dose group, 4 in 200 mg dose group, and 3 in the 300 mg dose group) and 2 subjects 
in the dose escalation cohort (both in the 450 mg dose group). None of the doses below 
450mg met the criteria for pausing enrollment. Thus, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in 
Study  2215 -CL-0101 is considered to be 300 mg.
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
In Stud y 2215 -CL-0101, ASP2215 has resulted in CRc in over 40% of subjects receiving 
80mg or higher dose. The median survival was over 7 months in the 120mg dose level. The 
majority of subjects inthe trial received multiple treatments prior to receiving ASP2215 . 
In summary , major findings in the safet y pharmacology  studies were vomiting, positive fecal 
occult blood and increased/decreased blood Ca+2in dogs and decreased urination and 
defecation in rats. In the oral 13 -week repeated dose toxicity  study  in rats and the 4 -and 
13-week repeated dose toxicit y studies in dogs, mortality  occurred at 20, 10 and 5 mg/kg per 
day, respectivel y. With respect to other major target organ toxicities, effects on the lacrimal 
gland, urinary  bladder, epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125], gastrointestinal tract, immune sy stem, hematopoietic 
system, ey e, liver, kidney and/or lung were observed in rats and dogs at 2.5 mg/kg per day  or 
more. All major findings were reversible and monitorable.
ASP2215 has a potential to induce genotoxicity  in vivo. ASP2215 showed teratogenic 
potential and embry o-fetal deaths in the embry o-fetal development toxicity  study  in rats.
This study  is designed to only  include subjects who are currentl y enrolled in an ASP2215 
trial and is intended to provide continued access to ASP2215 for subjects who have derived 
benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_255128] y participating.

5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Non-medication 
Therapy )
All medications and concomitant treatments administered from 28days prior to cy cle [ADDRESS_310075] be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inducers of CYP3A are prohibited.
Treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of P gp and 
concomitant drugs that target serotonin 5HT 1R or 5HT 2BR or sigma nonspecific receptor are 
to be avoided, with the exception of drugs that are considered absolutely  essential for the care 
of the subject. Treatment with concomitant dr ugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A should 
be avoided, with the exception of antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals that are used as 
standard of care to prevent or treat infections. If CYP3A inhibitors are used concomitantly , 
subjects should be closel ymonitored for AEs.
Precaution should be used in use of ASP2215 with concomitant drugs that are known to 
prolong QT or QTc intervals.
Precaution should be used in use of ASP2215 with concomitant drugs that are substrates of 
BCRP, since the transporter hasbeen shown to be inhibited by  [CONTACT_106346]2215 in in vitro studies.
Common CYP3A inhibitors, CYP3A inducers, drugs targeting the serotonin receptor, P -gp 
inhibitors or inducers and drugs known to prolong QT or QTc intervals are listed in 
[Appendix 12.1]. The investigator should consult individual labels for all drugs that the 
subject is taking to evaluate if they  fall into any  of the above named categories. For 
concomitant drugs that have t he potential to prolong QT or QTc intervals, a cardiology  
consult should be obtained as medicall y indicated. Any other treatments of AML (including 
but not limited to chemotherap y, radiotherap y, surgery , immunotherap y or cellular therap y) 
are prohibited du ring therapy  with ASP2215, with the exception of hy droxy urea up to [ADDRESS_310076] count below 50 x 109/L, prophy lactic

Compliance of the study  drug will be monitored by  [CONTACT_77780] b y the subject at visits . Compliance wi ll be documented.
The dose and schedule of ASP2215 administered to each subject will be recorded at every  
visit. Reasons for dose delay , reduction or omission will also be recorded. This information, 
plus tablet accountability for ASP2215 at every  visit wi ll be used to assess compliance with 
the treatment.
Treatment compliance should be monitored closely  and deviations in compliance should be 
reported to the Sponsor except in cases where directed b y protocol or Principal I nvestigator

abnormality  meets 1of the following criteria:
● Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
● Requires active intervention

5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An AEis considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any  of the followi ng outcomes:
● Results in death
● Is life threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
● Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
● Results in congenital anomaly  or birth defect
● Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255129] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476]/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious)
● Other medicall y important events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ,but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent 1of the othe r outcomes listed in the definition 
above .  These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacity , should also 
usually  be considered serious . Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bron chospasm ,blood dy scrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse .
Safety  events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, compar atorandbackground therapy ) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
● Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
● Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
● Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the me dicinal product(s)
● Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject exposure to 
the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])
All of the events of interest noted a bove should be recorded on the (e)CRF . Any situation 
invol ving these events of interest that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded 
on the AE page of the (e)CRF and marked ‘serious’ and the SAE worksheet .
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events . If an AEis reported 
that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious,” additional information 
on the event may  be requested .

period or within 180 days from the discontinuation of dosing, the Investigator should report the 
information to the Sponsor /delegated CRO as if it isanSAE . The expected date of delivery  or 
Sponsor: APGD ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_310094] menstruation, estimated conception date, 
pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this information.
The Investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the
pregnancy  is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s (spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y [including anomaly  in a 
miscarrie d fetus ]), the Investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure 
for SAE s.  Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  (which is 
categorized as an SAE ) is mentioned below.
● "Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abor tion and missed abortion
● Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug
● If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible "by 
[CONTACT_737]
● In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "normality "of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth
● Unless a congenital anomaly  are identified prior to spontan eous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination
If during the conduct of a clinical trial, a male subject makes his partner pregnant , the subject 
should report the pregnancy  to the Investiga tor.  The Investigator will report the pregnancy  to 
the Sponsor as an SAE .

Version 2. 1Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 1 9 QUALITY ASSURANCE
The Sponsor is implementing and maintaining quality  assurance and quality  control sy stems 
with written SOPs to ensure that trials are conducted and data are generated, documented, 
recorded andreported in compliance with the protocol, GCP andapplicable regula tory 
requirement(s).
The Sponsor or Sponsor 's designee may  arrange to audit the clinical study  at any  or all 
investigational sites and facilities . The audit may  include on -site review of regulatory  
documents, CRF s and source documents . Direct access to the se documents will be required 
by [CONTACT_77811]. 
10 STUDY ORGANIZATION
10.1 Independent Data Monitoring Committee
Not applicable.
10.2 Other Study Organization
Not applicable.
10.3 Registration of Subjects ( Specific to Japan)
The Investigator will fill in the subject registration forms to reconfirm whether the candidate 
subjects are eligible. The Sponsor should obtain the information on candidate subjects to be 
included in the clinical study  from subject registration forms befo re administration to confirm 
their eligibility , and to inform the Investigator of the results. 
In the situation of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y proliferative disease which is acute or requires immediate -treatment, 
it is difficult for the Sponsor to confirm the eligibility  of the candidate subjects prior to starting 
the study .  Confirmation should be made instantly  for the eligibility  of the candidates by  
[CONTACT_255158]’s registration forms obtained after the start of administration.
Prevention sy stem in IRT will be c onstructed to check duplicative registration from minimum 
information (each birth date and gender of subjects).
In case IRT system points out a possibility  as duplicative registration, clinical research 
monitor must check whether or not the registration is duplicative. 
Investigators and Clinical Research Coordinators in each site can check directly  with subjects 
whether or not the registration is duplicative.

The Investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as modera te or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring and 
follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed per tinent history , phy sical 
examination and laboratory  tests . The site should complete the Liver Abnormality -Case Report 
Form (LA-CRF) or appropriate document . Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function 
testing should be followed as described below.

may be considered an important medical event and may  be reported as a SAE . The Sponsor 
should be contact[CONTACT_255159].
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the Investigator is expected to:
● Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases .  Symptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘ AEs’ on the AE page of (e)CRF .  
Illnesses and conditions such as h ypotensive events anddecompensated cardiac disease 
that may  lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted .  Non alcoholic 
steatohepatitis is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic subject s and may  be 
associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels . The Investigator should ensure that 
the medical history  form captures any  illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be 
relevant in assessing hepatic function . 
● Obtain a history  of concomi tant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and
special diets . Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the (e)CRF . Informat ion on alcohol, other substance use anddiet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.
● Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
● Based on the subject’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including: 
oacute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents)
oultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
● Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
● Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  onthe LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of a n explanation for increased LFT s, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases orexposure to other agents associated with 
liver injury , the subject may  be discontinued from the study . The Investigator may determine 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue study  enrollment . Discontinuation of 
treatment should be consid ered if:
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metasteses )
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is

(Revised Sep. 21, 2021)  
1.[ADDRESS_630814] slow down the progress of 
this major public health problem .  
• Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder with evolving
layers of complexity. It has long been characterized by [CONTACT_490616]. However, the
symptomatology of Parkinson's disease is now recognized as
heterogeneous, with clinically significant non-motor features.
Similarly, its pathology involves extensive regions of the nervous
system, various neurotransmitters, and protein aggregates other
than just Lewy bodies. Parkinson's disease seems to result from a
complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors
affecting numerous fundamental cellular processes. The complexity
of Parkinson's disease is accompanied by [CONTACT_490617],
including an inability to make a definitive diagnosis at the earliest
stages of the disease and difficulties in the management of
symptoms at later stages.

7.0 STUDY DESIGN & METHO D 
The study is a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial, designed 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous young Fresh Frozen 
Plasma at 1 2.5 ml/kg in each of two doses, two days apart (25 ml/kg total).   
Patients in the Placebo group will receive infusions of 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
with Vitamin B2 at a volume rate equal to that of yFFP 12. 5 ml/kg in each of 
two doses, also two days apart.   
Consecutive patients are alternately assigned to one of the two treatment 
study groups, labeled ‘ yFFP ’ or ‘Saline’ group. Because yFFP is in short supply, 
INTRAVENOUS young FRESH FROZEN PLASMA (yFFP ®) INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT FOR

PROTOCOL FOR CONTROLLED STUDY 
3 | P a g ethe trial manager is free to change the strict alternate allocation sequence, 
according to the blood types of yFFP available. 
Each p articipant's condition will be classified as mild to moderate.   Patients 
above 2.5 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale will not be eligible for the trial.  
The primary outcome is the change in sum of the UPDRS scales 1-3 in the 
yFFP group compared with the placebo group.  
There will be one study site, a secondary care clinic specializing in neurology 
and infusions (Houston, [LOCATION_007]). 
Study will include 20 patients with Parkinson’s  disease. 
Blinding will be achieved by [CONTACT_490618] (0.1% 
Riboflavin in normal saline) solution into identical bags. The Riboflavin is 
added to achieve indistinguishable color when compared to the yFFP .

10.0 SCREENING, RECRUITME NT AND CONSENT  
Patients will be identified through the clinical site. 
Strategies will be implemented to maximize awareness of the trial in the patient 
population and increase referrals to the recruiting centers (informative materials 
will be included as part of the study documents).  
Patients will be given the “Patient Information Sheet ” to read at least 24-hours 
before the screening visit, where they will be given the “I nformed consent .” 
At the screening visit, there will be an opportunity for the participants to ask 
questions of a member of staff trained in all trial procedures, as delegated by [CONTACT_3433] e 
PI. The Principal Presenter or a co-investigator at each site will ensure that the 
participants meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria at the point of screening. 
Patients will be telephoned within 2 days, and maximally 4 days after baseline 
testing to confirm eligibility to participate. 
Screen failures may be rescreened ONLY where there is a short-term reason for 
ineligibility, such as non-availability for study visits due to planned holidays or an 
ongoing acute illness.

PROTOCOL FOR CONTROLLED STUDY 
 
6 | P a g e  
 A screening log will be kept at site to document details of patients invited to be 
screened for participation in the study. For patients who decline or are ineligible, 
this will document any reasons available for nonparticipation (where provided). 
The log will ensure potential participants are only approached once. 
The original signed consent form will be retained in the investigator site file, with a 
copy in the participant’s  medical notes, and a copy provided to the participant. 
The participant will specifically consent to their GP being informed of their 
participation in the study. 
The right to refuse to participate without giving reasons will be respected. 
11.0 STUDY MEDICATION  
Placebo 
Matching placebo infusions will be supplied by [CONTACT_490619]. These will be identical in appearance to the active infusions - they 
will be indistinguishable by [CONTACT_490620]. 
yFFP infusion 
The experimental intervention is 1 2.5 ml/kg intravenous Spectrum Plasma yFFP, per 
each of two infusions (25 ml/kg total), in combination with ongoing normal 
standard treatment. 
For reported side effects of Spectrum Plasma yFFP infusion, please refer to AABB 
Circular of Information. 
Contraindications include: 
Absolute contraindications to the use of yFFP are documented intolerance to 
plasma or its components or selective deficiency of immunoglobulin A (IgA ). 
Relative contraindications are Heart failure or pulmonary edema. 
Additional Cautions 
Patients should avoid citrus and highly acidic fruits (example: strawberries, 
blueberries, loganberries, cranberries, currants, gooseberries, pi[INVESTIGATOR_490613].) before and for a day after their last infusion, as patient may experience 
a reaction due to citrate.  
Selection and timing of dose for each participant  
Solutions will be available in [ADDRESS_630819] infusion up to day 5 is acceptable.

7 | P a g e  
 Data collection timelines remain the same, regardless of when infusions are 
received. Any patient who has not received his/her trial infusion by [CONTACT_4475] 5, that is, 
before day 6, will be withdrawn and not given trial medication.   
All patients who receive ≥80%  of the target dose will be included in the per-
protocol analysis.  
yFFP or placebo will be infused intravenously at an initial rate of not more than 2 
ml/minute for 15 minutes. If well tolerated, the rate of administration may be 
increased to 10-15 ml/minute for the remainder of the infusion.  
Infusion rate adjustments can be made if patients experience mild adverse clinical 
effects, reducing to 2 ml /minute in the first instance and further if required, while 
aiming for sufficient time to complete the entire infusion in a single day. 
The dosing is based on the patient weight, clinicians should refer to this table

 UPDRS scores are normally distributed.  An initial comparison between yFFP and 
placebo will then be afforded by a simple t-test.  In view of the small sample size 
and the categorical nature of the data, other analyses will be explored.  Those 
additional analyses may include a permutation test or other bootstrap 
methodology.  
Secondary analysis 
 Changes in the three UPDRS subscales 1-3 will also be analyzed separately.  
Additional analysis will be performed as dictated by [CONTACT_490629].  End scores 
may be modeled as a function of initial scores and lab tests.  The possibility of using 
the 12-week scores in a longitudinal model will be considered.   
27.0 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULAT ION

 Patient is randomized, but never receive any medicine (that is, the first 
infusion is never started - this is also termed ‘non -compliance’)   
Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any 
reason without providing a reason. The investigator also has the right to withdraw 
participants from the study if they consider that it is in the best interests of the 
participant. Should a participant decide to withdraw from the study, he/she will 
be asked to volunteer a reason for withdrawal but are at liberty not to state a 
reason. 
Should a participant withdraw from study drug only, efforts will be made to 
continue to obtain follow-up data with the permission of the patient. Subjects who 
withdraw from treatment early will be encouraged to return to the study site for 
follow-up, providing that consent is not withdrawn.

 Vascular disorders: shock (very rare). 
The adverse events reported above are expected in the sense that they are 
possible known side-effects of the study medication, but all reported instances of 
both serious and non-serious adverse events will be reported in this study. 
During the trial, investigators will be made aware of any updates to the summary 
of product characteristics (SPC) but the protocol need not be amended every 
time there is a change unless it directly affects the study conduct. The source of 
accurate information regarding the active medication must always be the SPC 
and not the study protocol, and the above information is provided to reflect the 
situation at study start only. 
34.0 PROTOCOL SPECIFICATI ONS 
For purposes of this protocol 
1. Any serious adverse events will be recorded throughout the duration of the 
trial until 14 days after cessation of study drug or until resolution. 
2. Non-serious adverse events will be recorded throughout duration of trial 
until 14 days after cessation of study drug. 
3. Serious adverse events exclude any pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490614]. 
35.0   RECORDING AND REPORTIN G SERIOUS ADVERSE EV ENTS OR 
REACTIONS  
All adverse events and all serious adverse events should be recorded. Depending 
on the nature of the event, the reporting procedures below should be followed. 
INTRAVENOUS young FRESH FROZEN PLASMA (yFFP ®) INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT FOR

16 | P a g e  
 Any questions concerning adverse event recording/reporting should be directed 
to the Trial Manager in the first instance. 
36.0 NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
All non-serious adverse events will be recorded on the “Patient  infusion log ”. 
Severity of all AEs will be graded on a three-point scale of intensity (mild, 
moderate, or severe): 
Mild: Discomfort is noticed, but there is no disruption of normal daily activities. 
Moderate: Discomfort is sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activities. 
Severe: Discomfort is incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal 
daily activities. 
Relation of an AE to treatment should be assessed by [CONTACT_093]/delegate 
(must be a clinician) on-site. Investigators will be responsible for managing all 
adverse events according to local protocols, as the study blood product is already 
approved for use in other indications. 
37.0 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) shall be recorded and reported on the serious 
adverse event form and sent to the Co-Investigator and Trial Manager within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The initial report can be made by 
[CONTACT_490633] “Report of Adverse Transfusion Form ” and faxing or emailing to 
Trial Manager. A record of this notification (including date of notification) must be 
clearly documented to provide an audit trail. In the case of incomplete 
information at the time of initial reporting, all appropriate information should be 
provided as follow-up as soon as this becomes available. 
Relationship of the SAE to the treatment should be assessed by [CONTACT_1275]/delegate (must be a clinician) at that site, as should the expected or 
unexpected nature of any serious adverse reactions. As this is a blinded study 
involving a placebo and biologics product, seriousness, causality and 
expectedness should be evaluated as though the patient was on the blood 
product. 
All SAEs-reporting responsibilities to FDA will be that of the Sponsor, with the support 
of the clinical sites. The Sponsor will report SAEs to the regulatory authority Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). 
SAEs that are fatal or life-threatening must be reported as soon as possible and no 
later than [ADDRESS_630831] aware of the reaction, and

unexpected), which will be distributed to the Sponsor. 
All investigators will be informed of all SAE’s assessed as fulfilling criteria as possibly, 
probably or definitely related to the study intervention and unexpected per the 
SPC. This will be regardless of medication administered in order to avoid the risk of 
inadvertently unblinding investigators, unless this information is needed for medical 
management of patients.  
The Trial Manager MUST be informed of all SAEs within [ADDRESS_630833] of this notification (including date of notification and 
acknowledgement of receipt) must be clearly documented to provide an audit 
trail.

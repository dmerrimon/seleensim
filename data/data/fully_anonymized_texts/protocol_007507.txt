 BACKGROUND  
Residual cardiovascular (CV) risk remains in dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_117693], 
underscoring the need for additional intervention.   Eicosapentaenoic acid  (EPA), an omega -[ADDRESS_131311] been reported relating to endothelial 
function, oxidative stress, foam cell formation, inflammation, plaque formation/progression, plat elet 
aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. EPA also improves atherogenic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_117694] -density lipoprotein cholesterol. All 
of this data supports  the biologic plausibility of EPA  as an anti -atherosclerotic agent  (1).  In the 
Study on Prevention of Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention with Marine Omega -3 Fatty Acids 
(SCIMO) data has shown that omega -3 PUFA (both DHA and EPA) slow progression of 
atherosc lerosis in coronary arteries  [2].  However , this data used invasive angiography.  There is 
only limited data regarding the effects of EPA without DHA added to statin versus statin alone 
therapy in reducing coronary plaque volume.  Utilizing integrated backscatter intravascular 
ultrasound (IB -IVUS) , 1.8 grams/day of EPA added to standard  statin therapy,  unlike statin therapy 
alone,  reduced plaque volume and inflammatory cytokines over 6 month s of follow -up (3). 
Recently, a second study using IB -IVUS showed reduction in both plaq ue and lipid volume over 6 
to 8 months in patients who were treated with 1.8  grams/day of EPA and high dose p itavastatin  
(4mg/day) unlike high dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_117695] (4).  Data regarding the effects of EPA on plaque as 
measured by [CONTACT_117708]  (MDCT) are even more limited , with an abstract  
report ing that MDCT showed  that patients randomly assigned to EPA,  unlike ezetimibe , reduced 
plaque  lipid content  at 1 year (5).Furthermore, a case report described a patient with plaque 
regression un der the influence of EPA (6).   
 
MDCT allows for a robust study of atherosclerosis at a nominal cost compared to intravascular 
ultrasound or invasive angiography to demonstrate that Vascepa has a positive effect on 
atherosclerosis, t o complement the outcome study ongoing.  This becomes a critical question 
among cardiologists , endocrinologists and primary care physicians , who will want to see event 
reduction and plaque reduction to feel compelled to use this important intervention on t heir high 
triglyceride patients. MDCT is now used in numerous ongoing studies evaluating  such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117696], statins, hormone replacement, garlic, anti -inflammatories and anti -diabetic agents. The 
ease of use, low cost and minimal invasiveness make s this much more practical and desirable as a 
study tool for atherosclerosis than either intravascular ultrasound or car otid intimal media thickness. 
A small multicenter study can determine with high confidence the ability  of Vascepa  to modify 
plaque  in persons with high triglycerides . 
 
Multiple studies have been published regarding the use of MDCT ang iography on plaque over time. 
Initial study sample size is estimated based on MDCTA data showing 24±13%  reduction in 
coronary artery plaque volume with st atin therapy ( 6). Other CCTA studies performed by [CONTACT_117709], and signific ant differences between groups.  In a 6 
month follow -up study of patients with ACS treated with a 5 lipo -oxygenase inhibitor or placebo, 
cardiac computed tomography angiography ( CCTA ) demonstrated a 21% increase in plaque in the 
placebo treated p opulation (including statins) ( 7).  In a second placebo controlled randomized 
study, placebo patients (on statins) , exhibited an 8.1% change in plaque, significantly greater than 
those rando mized to a garlic preparation (5 ). In a third study of patients with diabetes, the plaque 
3 
 progression by [CONTACT_117710] 24% per year, a 2.5 fold the rate of change seen in 
non-diabetic patients ( 8). We have also demonstrated significant differences in 1 year time between 
statin treated and non -statin treated cohorts ( 10).      
 
While clinical utility of Vascepa is well established in the >500 mg/dl triglyceride level group, there 
remains questions  about use in lower TG values. The ability to retard progression or induce 
regression of atherosclerosis would dramatically drive utilization and clinical confidence in the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Patients and physicians alike are looking for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], in addition to statins, to address 
this very high clinical need. The number of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117697] , so 
differentiating Vascepa in this crowded field will be met with great enthusiasm. More evidence of 
benefit,  along multiple lines, is clearly a mechanism to improve confidence for physicians and 
patients alike.    
 
The goal of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with Vascepa (4 g rams) results in a greater 
change from baseline in  low attenuation plaque  than placebo in subjects with elevated  triglycerides 
(200-499 mg/dl).  
 
HYPOTHESIS  
Primary Hypothesis : Vascepa  (4 grams/day)  and statin therapy will reduce progression of low 
attenuation plaque volume over 9-[ADDRESS_131312] angiography 
(CTA) as compared to statin alone in patients with triglycerides 200-499 gm/dl .  The mechanisms 
underlying the coronary effect of EPA  will include a) reduction in non -calcified coronary 
atherosclerotic plaque, b) reduction in vulnerability features of non -calcified coronary 
atherosclerotic plaque.   
 
Secondary Hypothesis :  1) Vascepa will significantly reduce non-calcified coronary  plaque and total 
plaque volume progression as compared to placebo. 2 ) Decreases in plasma levels of triglycerides , 
remnant lipoproteins  (VLDL 3-C + IDL -C), Arachadonic acid  (AA),  an improvement in critical 
indices of inflammation, and an increase in the apoA1  to remnant ratio  (apolipoprotein A1/ [VLDL 3-
C + IDL -C]), EPA,  EPA/AA ratio associated with EPA  therapy will be predictive of improvement 
in non -calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden and/or vulnerability features.  
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective : Determine progression rates of low attenuation plaque under influence of 
Vascepa as compared to  placebo . 
  
Secondary Objectives : a) To determine the effects of Vascepa on the morphology and composition 
of non -calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaque (NCP),  including the progression of total plaque 
volume and whether these effects are modulated by [CONTACT_117711] ; b) 
To determine the effects of Vascepa on detailed markers of inflammation (Lp -PLA 2, hsCRP, IL -6), 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_6520] ( ox-LDL, remnants (VLDL 3-C + IDL -C), apoliprotein A1 to remnant ratio, 
EPA, AA, EPA/AA ratio ), and traditional CVD risk indices.

Power Calculation  
Assuming 80% and an alpha of 0.05, a total of 70 (35 per arm) patients are ne eded to evaluate the 
primary outcome of the study  (EAST, version 6.3; Cambridge, MA) . The primary outcome is the 
progression rate of low attenuation plaque volume  at final assessment compared to baseline 
assessment. Initial study sample size was estimated based on MDCTA data showing 24±13% 
reduction in coronary artery plaque volume with moderate dose statin therapy (7).   We assume an 
8% reduction in plaque volume  (1/3 that seen with statin therapy), would be the minimal important 
change in non -calcified pla que volume .  Multiple studies have shown similar progression rates 
under the influence of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (8 -11).  Furthermore, ample data has been obtained using 
low attenuation plaque (LAP) volume  in both MDCT and IVUS Studies.  In the Niki study (3)  
Statin +EPA vs Statin alone  at 6 months) , at lipid volume decreased from 18.5 to 15.0(18.9%);  
control 17.8 to 19.8 -increased 11.2%  (difference 30.1%) .  The CHERRY  study, (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2830] +EPA 
vs Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117700] 6 -8 months) , lipid volume decreased from  39.2 to 34.8 (11%);  control 42.7 
6 
 to 39.3  (8%).   Thus, plaque decreased between 11 and 18.9%  in two studies  in the EPA arms .  
Furthermore, in the Shintani study of EPA vs ezetimibe, there was a change of 29.2-25.1 (decreased 
14%), using the same range of H U that we are using to represent LAP. Based on these 3 trials, an 
8% improvement in LAP in the EPA arm of the trial being proposed in this protocol is reasonable.  
Assuming an average of 1.[ADDRESS_131314] plaque 
correlation of 0.24 ( 12) (providing variance inflation factor of 1.[ADDRESS_131315]) ( 13), [ADDRESS_131316] a 8% difference in plaque volume between the active 
compared to placebo group. Overall change for each plaque type from baseline will be calculated 
for each patient.  Assuming a 15% dropout rate, a total of 80 (40 per arm)  patients would need to be 
enrolled.  
 
Interim Analysis  
Using the Lan -DeMets version of the O’Brien -Fleming group sequential boundaries for a 2 -look 
sequential design (1 interim  at 9 months  + final analysis), the statistical power to test the primary 
study endpoint is 80% based on a sample size of 70 patients randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_131317]. If a p -value of 
<0.[ADDRESS_131318] been achieved.   
 
Statistical Analysis   
Baseline examination of the subjects will include the results of their demographics, coronary risk 
factor, laboratory tests, coronary calcium, as well as coronary plaque volume/composition. These 
baseline characteristics will be compared between the arms. Baseline information regarding risk 
factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (cigarette sm oking status, systemic hypertension, 
family history of premature atherosclerosis, menopausal and hormone replacement status in 
women, sedentary lifestyle, current medications, chest pain questionnaire and measures of obesity, 
diabetes medication use) will also be determined.  After randomization, participants will evaluated 
at 3, 9 and 12 months , and if needed 15 months (by [CONTACT_648] -only) and 18 months,  to assess 
compliance with medication, and receive an additional supply of medicine. At 9 and 18 (if needed) 
months , coronary plaque volume/composition will be measured at MDCT by [CONTACT_117716], who are not aware of study -group assignments. The primary 
analysis will utilize  intention -to-treat principles, with study s ubjects analyzed by [CONTACT_117717]. A sensitivity analysis will be performed for those 
adhering to interventions for over 80% of the duration of the study. Differences in baseline 
characteristics between groups will use analysis of variance for normally distributed continuous 
traits and chi -square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables . For normally distributed 
continuous outcomes, including percent change in low attenuation plaque , we estimate mean 
percent group differences using linear mixed models with baseline value, time and treatment group 
as fixed effects. Least squares means will be estimated from the models. Models evaluating per 
patient outcomes will include fixed effects. Natural log -transform ations will be used for variables 
with log -normal distributions. For the analyses of the primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy 
variables, the statistical modeling assumptions should be examined. If significant departures from 
normality (p -value <0.[ADDRESS_131319]) and/or homogeneity of variance are observed, 
the non -parametric analysis approach will be considered. When parametric and non -parametric 
results do not corroborate each other, the results from the non -parametric analysis will b e used. 
7 
 Otherwise, the parametric analysis will be reported.  Baseline characteristics will be provided as 
mean and standar d deviation or median and interquartile range, changes from baseline are provided 
with 95% confidence limits. All st atistical tests repor t 1-sided p-values  for the outcomes . A p-value 
less than 0.0 48 will be considered significant  for the outcomes . All analyses will be performed 
using SAS for Windows, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North  Carolina).  
 
CCTA EVALUATIONS  
CCTA  
As successfully performed in previous NHLBI -funded investigations by [CONTACT_978], CCTA scans will be 
read in a blinded fashion at the MESA CT Reading Center (RC). CCTA will be performed using 
state of the art 64+ MDCT technology. At Intermountain Health, a 64-slice coronary computed 
tomography (CT) scanner (Aquilion 64,  Toshiba America Medical Systems) will be used.  At Los 
Angeles Biomedical research Center, a Revolution 256 -detector scanner (GE Medical, Milwaukee, 
WI). Both sites will pass quality control trai ning under RC supervision and have extensive expertise 
in performing CCTA. All participants will be hydrated pre and post scan. Nonionic contrast 
material will be used. The CCTA study will incorporate all dose reduction strategies available, 
including pros pective ECG -triggering and iterative reconstruction. Participant burden for the CCTA 
is anticipated to be [ADDRESS_131320] 
injection.  
2.  Preproce dural Medications [beta blockade (only when ne eded for increased heart rate)]  
a. Metoprolol : If the heart rate is >70 beats per minute (BPM), 50 mg of metroprolol  will be given 
orally and if HR remains >70 BPM at the scan acquisition then, intravenous metoprolol 2.5 -5 mg 
every 5 minutes administered to achieve a heart rate between 50 -70 BPM as blood pressure 
tolerates under physician supervision.  Participants may receive intravenous diltiazem 10 -25 mg IV 
if contraindicated for β -blockade (reactive airway disease).   
b. Nitroglycerin : Unless systolic blood pressure is less than [ADDRESS_131321] A dministration  
CCTA will be performed during a 4 -5 ml/sec intravenous iodinated infusion.  The total contrast 
dose will not exceed [ADDRESS_131322] reader will interactively use axial images, multi -planar reconstructions (MPR) and 
maximum intensity p rojections to assess the degree of luminal narrowing stenosis in all assessable 
coronary segments. Standard display settings will be used for the evaluation of the CCTA scans 
(window width 800 HU; window center 250 HU). Stenotic segments will be defined as  minimal (1 -
25% diameter narrowing); mild (26% -50%); moderate (51 -70%) and severe (>70% stenosis). We 
will specifically report % diameter stenosis (not area), since the spatial resolution of CCTA cannot 
[ADDRESS_131323] narrowed diameter in each segment 
will be reported even if the plaque is eccentric. Segment stenosis score will also be generated based 
on the degree of underlying stenotic disease in each segment (0=none, 1=1 -25%, 2=26 -50%, 3=51 -
70%, 4=>70%). The  summed scores of [ADDRESS_131324] its classification as calcified plaque. To calculate the 
Agatston score, each accepted lesion is assigned a score by [CONTACT_117718] a 
coefficient based on its maximum HU (coefficient of 1 if maximum=130 -199, 2 if 200 -299, 3 if 
300-399, 4 if ≥400). The Agatston score is the sum of the scores across all accepted lesions.  We 
will also derive volume scores, and density measures of each plaque.  
 
Plaque quantificati on 
Plaque volume will be assessed per slice in all affected coronary segments measured by [CONTACT_31576] -
automated quantification software (QAngio, Medis, Netherlands) . First, an automatic tree extraction 
algorithm will be used to obtain all the [ADDRESS_131325] 2 adjacent slices (slice 
thickness 0.6 mm) will be determined. For each lesion, minimal lumen diameter will be summed 
and plaque reported as non -calcified, low attenuation or calcified. The protocol for quantitative 
plaque assessment has been widely used in numerous previous studies by [CONTACT_978], including active 
NHLBI studies: R01 HL095129 (MACS) and 5U01AG030644  (T Trials, PI - Snyder).   
 
Plaque Composition  
Plaque Composition  is based upon predefined fixed intensity cutoff values of CT attenuation. These 
are based upon studies by [CONTACT_117719]. The fixed HU cut -off values that will be used for classifying are: 
-50 to 50 for low attenuation plaque, 51–130 for non -calcified, 131 –350 for fibrotic, and >[ADDRESS_131326] -processing and Reconstruction  
For prospective imaging, several phases will be transmitted to the MESA RC.  In case of vessel 
wall calcification, additional images will be reconstructed using sharp -tissue convolution kernel and 
analyzed using a bone window setting to compensate for blooming artifacts. We anticipate the 
number of excluded segments to be <3%, and the number of image -quality excluded participants to 
9 
 be <1%.  Stented segments will be excluded from baseline and follow -up analysis for plaque and 
CAC measures.

Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following  
criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening - Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious”  
refers to an event in which the patient was at  risk of death at the time of the event. It  
does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were  
more severe.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] - Note: In general,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117706] a pre -existing condition(s) that did not worsen from  
baseline is not considered adverse events and should not be reported as SAEs.  
• Results in disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is an important medical event - Note : Important medical events that may not result in  
death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475],  
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may  
require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive  
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do  
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or  the development of drug dependency.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting – Procedure for Investigators  
1. Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_131333] be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24  
hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets any of  
the aforementioned serious criteria). SAEs that the investigator considers  related to study  
medication occurring after the [ADDRESS_131334] (IRB  
 in accordance with local requirements . All investigators involved in studies using the same 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) will receive any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) reports for onward submission to their local IRB as required. All reports sent 
to investigators  will be blinded.  
2. Follow -Up Reports  
The investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided, or until the  
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the  
patient dies. Within [ADDRESS_131335]  
update the SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any  
supporting documentation (e.g., laboratory test reports, patient discharge summary, or  
autopsy reports) to th e Sponsor or designee via fax or email.  
[ADDRESS_131336] (DSMB)  
The adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_45959] . A DSMB consisting of 
individuals with expertise in each of the efficacy areas ( cardiac computed tomography , 
atherosclerosis) will be established.  [CONTACT_117727] will chair the DSMB, and will also be 
represented by [CONTACT_117726] (cardiologist at IMH).  DSMB will be independent from all staff 
involved in the day -to-day conduct of the study. The DSMB Chair will prepa re interim reports to 
the DSMB on a regular basis, every [ADDRESS_131337] related adverse 
effects, will also be reviewed in an unblinded fashion. Formal statistical comparisons on 
incidence of AEs, lab abnormalities, and concomitant medication use likely will lack power 
given the relatively small amount of patients.  Will therefore use descripti ve statistics for these 
data.  The DSMB will decide on the basis of these data whether to recommend modifying or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_117707].

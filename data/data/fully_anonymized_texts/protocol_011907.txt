General Information (PI[INVESTIGATOR_609])  
This is a single center double blind randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of 
the addition of anesthetic blocks in reducing systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_548368] (PO and IV) and lowering pain scores when added to a standardized ERAS ( Enhanced Recovery After 
Surgery) protocol bundle, in patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy at 
MMH -TMC.  
We seek to compare the efficacy of two interventions:  
• Local anesthesia with sham QL block.  
• Quadratus lumborum block (QL block) with sham  local.  
Both types of anesthetics options (local anesthetics and QL blocks) are used as usual care and depend on surgeon preference without strong evidence of efficacy.  
Our main objective is to assess which intervention best improves the quality of recovery, reduces systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_548368] (PO and IV) and lowers pain scores in patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy at 24 hours.  
 
Background Information 
 
In 2017, the CDC reported 50,000 deaths related to Opi[INVESTIGATOR_548369]. Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_548370] 40% of these deaths (1). Post -operative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_548371]' risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_548372] (2- 7). Therefore, effective interventions are needed to 
address this problem, such as reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_548373]- operatively and in the 
immediate postoperative period.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-22-0158 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/18/[ADDRESS_717764] shown to effectively provide analgesia 
for surgery -associated pain following abdominal surgery (8).  
 
However conflicting results have been found regarding their use in laparoscopy. Many clinical trials tested  the TAP block (9- 12) while others tested the QL block (13, 14). (15)  
 
QL blocks have been proven to be effective in reducing morphine consumption after cesarean sections(16, 17), however this was not noted after laparoscopic colorectal surgery (18).  
Confl icting results  again have been demonstrated in a couple of RCTs after 
laparoscopic gynecologic surgery (19- 25). 
Results of an RCT including 120 patients undergoing cholecystectomy, demonstrated that TAP and QL blocks similarly reduced postoperative pain scores and analgesia consumption, with high patient satisfaction. However, subcostal TAP block could be considered preferable to QL block because it can be applied easily and in a shorter time 
(22). 
 
The UT faculty at MHH usually offer QL blocks to patients presenting for minimally invasive hysterectomy while counseling about possible benefit in reducing pain during recovery. If a patient is not offered a QL blovk or declines, the surgeon will give local 
anesthetic at the port site.  
 
While local anesthetic at the port site is given by [CONTACT_548406], (QL) blocks are given by [CONTACT_548407]. QL blocks ar e done under ultrasound guidance to 
improve efficacy and reduce complications.  
 
Local anesthesia is given as per usual care: Each trocar site is infiltrated with 3 mL of the 0.25% marcaine in a diamond- shape pattern below and above the fascia.  
 
The quadrat us lumborum block (QL 2) is the newest modality, involves injection of 
local anesthesia in a fascial place formed partly by [CONTACT_548408].  
 
It is described to cover many dermatomes (range from T4 to L1) with cephala d and 
posterior spread to provide both visceral and somatic analgesia likely due to paravertebral and possibly epi[INVESTIGATOR_548374] 24 hours (19- 21). It is 
speculated that the use of QL block will reduce the use of systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_548375] 24- 36 hours.

Objectives  
This study aims to compare quality of recovery as well as peri -operative systemic 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_548376] (QL- 2) is 
added to the standard pain management.  

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-22-0158 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/18/2022  Page 4 of 19   Primary Outcome measure:  
For the primary outcome, we plan to Compare the Quality of Recovery (QOR -40) 
validated questionnaire scores between different arms  
a. At 24 hours  
The Quality of Recovery -40 (QoR -40) questionnaire measures the quality of 
recovery from anesthesia through five dimensions: physical comfort, physical 
independence, emotional state, psychological support, and pain. The validity, 
reliability, ease of use, r esponsiveness, and cross -cultural adaptation of QoR -[ADDRESS_717766] been previously confirmed and this questionnaire has been used 
successfully in several clinical trials. (27). (Appendix 1). This questionnaire takes  
6.3 min to complete and will be filled by [CONTACT_941] r esearch assistant.  
 
Secondary Outcome measures:  
 
1. Compare pain score (rest and dynamic as coughing or moving from lying down to 
sitting up) between the interventions at several time points: Patients will be instructed to use the visual analog scale (NRS), [ADDRESS_717767] imaginable pain) at different time  points,  
a. PACU immediately  postoperatively  
b. At the time of first opi[INVESTIGATOR_548377],  
c. At the time of discharge (most patients are discharged the same day) 
d. On d ay 1 (24+/=4 hours),  
e. On day  [ADDRESS_717768] the VAS scores documented by [CONTACT_548409][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
3. A telephone call will be don e at 24 hours (+/ -4 hours) by [CONTACT_548410] [ADDRESS_717769] pain medication in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
5. Estimate PONV scores (Worst score) before discharge across  different 
interventions. Scale: (none, mild, moderate  severe).  
6. Compare the time needed to administer the intervention QL Block.  
7. Compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_548378]  (OME) 
a. In the first 24 hours after the surgery (which is the duration of the block).  
b. [ADDRESS_717770]-surgery  
8. We will use the oral morphine conversion tabl e to convert any opi[INVESTIGATOR_548379]  (26). 
9. Assess possible complications with each intervention (expected to be low).

• Morbid obesity (BMI > 50), due to expected technical difficulty to achieve the block.  
− Usual pain management will continue regardless of which arm of the study  patients 
are in and measurements of pain scores, narcotic usage and abdominal numbness 
will be assessed in the post -operative  period.  
 
 
Study Design and Procedures  
 
The study will be reported according to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials) guidelines (28).  
 
All medications and procedures used in this study (0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], dexamethasone, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, QL blocks) are FDA approved and have been determ ined to 
be usual care in the coverage analysis.  
1- Recruitment and  consents:  
Patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy at MHH will be recruited and consented for enrollment and block randomized to one of 2 arms: Local anesthesia and QL block. The regional anesthesia nurse would consent the patients.  
Spanish consents are available for Spanish speaking patients. 
Patients will not be told if they will be receiving the drug or the control.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-22-0158 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/18/[ADDRESS_717771] been doing so for years. They will be drawing the active or the placebo drug in a sterile manner and give the syringes to the “regional” anesthesiologist and the scrub nurse, assuring safety of administration. We have discussed this procedure with DeAnn 
Kelly -Williams the Nurse in charge for the Gyn Surgical Services and she is argeable 
with the procedures (Email: Deanna.kelly -williams@memorialhermann,org)  
The procedure is done after the patient is placed under general anesthesi a assuring 
blinding for the patient as well as the research assistant who has no access to Care4. Regional anesthesiologist and surgeon are also blinded as they will be handed the medication sterile in a syringe in both cases.  
 
 
2- Randomization:  
It is done i n preoperative unit at the time of obtaining consent via redcap set up by [CONTACT_160295].  
The Nurse anesthetist will then prepare the 20 mls syringes and label them (all drugs 
are visually identical to normal saline) according to the allocation specified by [CONTACT_101148]. See figure 3:

Block procedures:  
The nerve blocks will be placed after the patients are placed under general anesthesia, 
as is usual.  
 
Skin is prepared twice with application of chlorhexidine 0.5% in ethanol 82%. The block 
procedure is performed under ultrasound guidance with a curvilinear transducer covered by a sterile transparent plastic sheath.  
 
 The QL block will be admin istered on both the right and left sides. The transducer is 
placed transverse immediately cranial to the iliac crest and at the level of the posterior axillary line. The needle is then inserted inplane from the lateral edge of the transducer and advanced t hrough the quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle until the 
needle tip penetrated the epi[INVESTIGATOR_548383]. The anesthetic is injected after repeated negative aspi[INVESTIGATOR_548384] (PM) muscles posterior to the 
transversalis fascia  (30-32).

5- Comparison:  
The following variables will be recorded to compare the different interventions in the 
following timeline:  
− In PACU: (Registered nurse, performs usual care) data is collected  retrospectively 
by [CONTACT_11077] 
o Collect pain score rest and dynamic using the Vi sual analog scale  (VAS)  
 Immediately upon arrival  
 At the time of first opi[INVESTIGATOR_544602]

discharge)  
o Time elapsed to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834] (in minutes)  
o Cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_548385]  
o patient satisfaction will be measured on a Likert scale (5 points)  
o The incidence of postoperative adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, 
dizziness, headache, urinary retention, local anesthesia- induced side  effects 
(paresthesia, hearing disturbance, visual disturbance, and dysarthria)  
− At 24 hours (+/ - 4 hours) telephone call by [CONTACT_548416]  
o Filled Tramadol  (Yes/no)

o Refill on pain meds, yes/no and which medications.  
During the telephone encounters or the clinical visits, patients will be asked if they filled 
their prescription for Tramadol/narcotic and how many pi[INVESTIGATOR_548390]). If the patient is not seen at the [ADDRESS_717776]  participation . 
We currently perform at the minimum 5 hysterectomies per week and Memorial 
Hermann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Laparoscopic and Robotic) and expect to randomize half of the patients, to complete the study within up to 2 years after IRB approval.  
 
Sample Size and Power  
 
• Based on previous studies, the mean standard deviation of QOR -40 after 
gynecologic laparoscopy are 150- 170 and 10 -15, respectively.  
• A clinically significant difference would be  10-15. 
• A sample size of [ADDRESS_717777] the difference of  20 
points in the global QOR -40 score, a SD 25, with a Type 1 error of 5% and a 
power of  90%.  
• 76 patients  will be included to allow for a dropout  rate of approximately  18%.  Lost 
to follow up is expected to be low. 
 
For pain scores in the VAS: Meaningful clinical difference in VAS scores is 30%  
− 
Analysis Plan/Statistics  
 
• For baseline patient characteristics, continuous variables wi ll be reported as 
medians with 25th and 75th percentiles (interquartile range [IQR]), and categorical variables as counts and percentages.  
• To compare across groups, Kruskal -Wallis tests will be performed for continuous 
variables and Chi -square tests for categorical  variables.  
 
• CONSORT diagram will be  performed  
• Intention to treat analysis will be performed  
• All unadjusted outcomes will be reported descriptively (mean SD/ median  IQR)  
• For all outcomes, we will conduct intent -to-treat Bayesian analysis to calculate 
probabilities  of intervention benefits  and harms.  We will use neutral  priors  and exclude 
large treatment effects. We will report posterior medians of group differences, their 
corresponding 95% credible intervals, and probability of treatment  benefit.  
 
Primary outcome as QOR will be analyzed with a negative binomial regression model to 
account for expec ted skewness. The model will include group (local, QL), and type of 
surgery as covariates. We will account for surgery type (Robotic versus laparoscopic hysterectomy) simply because of the difference in port placement and port size between both approaches.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-22-0158 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/18/2022  Page 12 of 19   − We will report risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing local to QL block. 
We will assess the normality of the data and robustness of the conclusion using the appropriate tests.  
− As the pain scores are repeated over time, a linear mix ed model analysis (patient as 
random intercept, patient -time as random slope, unstructured covariance) will be 
undertaken to identify any treatment differences across  time.  
− Arrival to PACU is defined as time 0. 
All opi[INVESTIGATOR_548391]’s electronic file and are 
tallied to form the total postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  
 
FUNDINGS:  
 
There is no funding for the study, this is PI [INVESTIGATOR_548392].  
The cost will be that of the catheters for the blocks which will be donated to the anesthesiologist and no charges are incured to the patient or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
The anesthesia research team will waive billing for the QL procedure for the study patients. Local anesthesia is bundled with the surgery and does not constitute a separate charge. Local anesthesia is bundled with the surgery and does not constitute a separate charge. The placebo is just 20 mls of saline solution.  
 
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
Oversigh t of the trial is provided by [CONTACT_079] (PI), [CONTACT_548423] and 
Co-investigators Drs Nadia Hernandez and Sara Guzman who will be actively involved 
in the conduct of the study.  
MONITORING PROCEDURES  
 
[CONTACT_548424] assures that informed consent is obtained prior to performing any research 
procedures, that all subjects meet eligibility criteria, and that the study is conducted 
according to the IRB -approved research plan.  
Study data are accessible at all ti mes for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254]- investigators to review. [CONTACT_548425] and [CONTACT_548426] will review study conduct : accrual, drop- outs, protocol 
deviations on a quarterly basis. The PI, CO -PIs will review AEs individually real- time 
and in aggregate on a quarterly basis.  They will also review serious adverse events 
(SAEs), including anesthetic allergy, local anesthetic toxicity, as well risk of infection in 
real-time. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_44296], AEs, and SAEs are reported to the 
IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF SAEs AND AEs  
 
For this study, the following standard AE definitions are used:  
 
Adverse event: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporall y associated with the use of a  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-22-0158 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/18/2022  Page 13 of 19   medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the 
medical treatment or procedure.  
Serious Adverse Event: Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172677]  
• Persistent or significant  disability/incapacity 
AEs are graded according to the following scale:  
Mild: An experience that is transient, & requires no special treatment or 
intervention. The experience does not generally interfere with usual daily 
activities. This includes transient laboratory test alterations.  
Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments. 
The experience impacts usual daily activities. Includes laboratory test alterations indicating injury, but without long- term risk.  
Severe: An experience that requires therapeutic intervention. The experience 
interrupts usual daily activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for treatment it becomes an SAE.  
The study uses the following AE attribution scale  
 
Not related: The AE is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of the event is most plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal 
sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event).  
Possibly related: An event that follows a reasonable tem poral sequence from 
the initiation of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Related:  The AE is clearly related to the study  procedures.  
 
AEs are identified: during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548393] 
a review of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374962] a daily basis and a physical examination of the subject. 
After discharge, AEs are assessed at time of study follow -up visits.  
SAEs and specific procedure- associated AEs are reported to [CONTACT_548427] and [CONTACT_548428] within 24 hours. In addition, all AEs are reported according to the UT IRB, AE reporting guidelines.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/18/2022  Page 14 of 19   PLAN FOR DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
Compliance of regulatory documents and study data accuracy and completeness will be 
maintained through an internal study team quality assurance process.  
Confidentiality throughout the trial is maintained by [CONTACT_548417].  
 
 
Assessment of safety: Safety of the procedure will be ensured by [CONTACT_548418], as well as using ultrasound for placement of the

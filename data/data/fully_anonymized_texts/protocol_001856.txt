Description :This document details the reporting and analy sisplan for BRF117277, a
non-randomized, multi -center Phase II stud yto evaluate efficacy and safety of combined
therapy  with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF mutation -positive
melanoma with brain met astases.  Four cohorts based on typeof mutation, ECOG
performance score, presence of symptoms and prior local therap yof brain lesions will be
treated.  The primary objective is to assess the intracranial response rate in subjects with
locally confirmed B RAF V600E -mutation positive melanoma that has metastasized to the
brain without sy mptoms and have not undergone prior local therap yfor brain metastases,
ECOG score of 0 -1(Cohort A).Other secondary objectives include intracranial,
extracranial, and overa llresponse in all cohorts, progression -freeand overall survival,
duration of intracranial, extracranial, and overall response inallcohorts, and the
incidence and severity ofadverse events by[CONTACT_9084].

92.1. Statistical Hypotheses
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to assess the intracranial response (IR) rate
inBRAF V600E mutation positive subjects assessed by [CONTACT_290940]1.1 criteria for Cohort A:
Cohort A: 75 Subjects who are treatment -naive for brain metastases,
asymptomatic and stable on corticosteroids.
The study is des igned to provide evidence to support the null hypothesis, H0:IRR≤ 35%
or to reject it in favor of thealternative hypothesis, HA:IRR ≥ 50% for BRAF V600E
mutation -positive subjects in Cohort A.
This hypothesis willbetested using a one- sided test for superiorit ywith α=0.05. There
will be no other testing; therefore, there will be no adjustment of the TypeI error for
multiple testing.
3. STUDY DESIGN
This study will evaluate the safety andefficacy of 4 cohorts, each receiving the same
treatment. Cohort A:Seventy -five subjects with locally confirmed BRAF V600E
cutaneous melanoma with metastases to the brain confirmed by[CONTACT_9268],asymptomatic,
without prior local (brain) therapy and ECOG score of 0 -1.Cohort B: Fifteen subjects
with locally confirmed BRAF V600E cutaneous melanoma with metastases to the brain 
confirmed by[CONTACT_9268],asymptomatic, with prior local (brain) therapy  and ECOG score of 0 -
1. Cohort C: Up to fifteen subjects with locally confirmed BRAF V600D/K/R cutaneous
melanoma with metastases to the brain confirmed by [CONTACT_9268] , asymptomatic, with or
without prior local (brain) therapy and ECOG score of 0 -1.Cohort D:Fifteen subjects
with locally confirmed BRAF V600D/E/K or R cutaneous melanoma with metastases to
the brain confirmed by[CONTACT_9268],symptomatic, with or without prior local (brain) therapy and
ECOG score of 0 -2.
Subjects will receive dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily until
evidence of disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity .Subjects will be
required to meet all eligibility criteria and return to clinic on a monthly basis for clinical, 
skin and laboratory assessments. Intracranial and extracranial disease will be assessed at
baseline, Week 4, Week 8, andevery 8 weeks thereafter.  After Week 40,disease
assessments may be performed every 12 weeks. Response to treatment will be evaluated
using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST)version 1.1.
AnIndependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be used in this study .
Protocol -specified guidelines for dose adjustments, interruptions and discontinuation due
to adverse events are provided in Protocol Amendment 05, dated 13 July 2016
GlaxoSimthKline Document Number (2013N168437_07). After discontinuation of study
treatment , subjects will remain in the study for follow -upassessments including monthly
skin assessments up to [ADDRESS_354881] dose of stud ytreatment,
whichever is earlier.
4. PLANNED ANAL YSES
In line with I CH E9 [European Medicines Evaluation Agency (CPMP/I CH/3633/96) ],
membership of the analysis populations will be determined using th e definitions in 
Section 6of this RAP.
The primary efficacy analy sis willbeperformed when allsubjects inCohort A have had
the opportunity for three (3) post baseline disease assessments. Atthis time the final
intracranial response analysis will be performed and an interim anal ysis of PFS and OS
will be provided. The final analy sisof PFS, OS, and safety will occur after allsubjects
have died or are otherwise lost to follow -upor 3years from the first dose of study
treatment, whichever is soonest.
4.1. Interim Analyses
There isaformal interim analy sisfor futility only with a statistical decision rule in this
trial. For Cohort A,an interim analy sis will take place after [ADDRESS_354882] an
IR (intracranial CR or PR) for the trial to continue.  If [ADDRESS_354883] had the
opportunity for three (3) post-baseline disease assessments. This analy siswill be
performed after the database is frozen. After allsubjects have died or are otherwise lost to
follow -upor 3yearsfrom the first dose of study treatment, whichever is soonest, the End
of Study analy siswill be performed on the total cumulated safet ydata and overall
survival. This analy siswill be performed after the End of Study database is frozen. The
display s that will be included in thisanaly sisare listed in Section 14.1.1 .

BRF117277
115. SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERA TIONS
5.1. Sample Size Assumptions
The sample size is based on the hypothesized improvement in intracranial response over
study [COMPANY_004] BRF113929 (BREAK- MB) in Cohort A.  A 35% intracranial response (IR) is
not clinically significant over existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. An intracranial response (IR)of 50% is
of clinical significance.
For the primary endpoint cohort (A),75BRAF V600E mutation positive subjects will be
enrolled. At the time of the primary efficacy analy sis,at least 33 subjects with an IR
(44%) are required to establish that the evidence does not support the null hypothesis.
The sample size is based on a one- sided superiority test of binomial proportions with an
overall TypeI error rate 0.05 incorporating an interim analy siswith the spending function
proposed by[CONTACT_290941],(1983) with Pocock Boundary . The null hypothesis in Cohort A will be
tested assuming IR of 35% against an IR of 50% using a one-sided test for superiority
with α=0.05 and power=82%. There will be no other testing; therefore, there will be no
adjustment of the TypeI error for multiple testing and the primary endpoint test i n the
primary analy siswill be performed at 5% level.
5.2. Sample Size Sensitivity
Table 1shows statistical power for the test of the null hypothesis in Cohort A under the
assumed IRof 35%.   It includes statistical power for scenarios where the alternative
response rate is lower and higher.   All statistical power calculations assume 75 BRAF
V600E mutation positive subjects in the Cohort A All Treated Subjects population.

6. ANAL YSIS POPULATIONS
6.1. AllTreated Populations
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication will comprise the All
Treated subjects (ATS) population.
The V600E population will comprise all BRAF V600E mutation positive subjects in the 
ATS population.
The V600D/K/R population will comprise all BRAF V600D/K/R mutation positive 
subjects in the ATS population.
6.2. AllEnrolled
The All Enrolled population comprises all subjects who were enrolled regardless of
whether they had a dose of study treatment.
6.3. Safet yPopulation
The safety population is the ATS population.
6.4. AnalysisDatasets
Primary efficacy analyses will be based on investigator -assessed results in the ATS
population. Ifindependent review of efficacy is done, those analysis results will be
secondary .
Safety analyses will use the ATS population.
The V600D/K/R population, defined above and identified in the study protocol as a
population tobeused to report on secondary efficacy endpoints by [CONTACT_32024], will not be 
used.   This change was made to accommodate the small sample size in Cohorts B-D (15
subjects per cohort). Analy sesof subgroups of 15 subjects would not generally be
meaningful and are not specified a priori .
7. TREA TMENT COMPA RISONS
There arenotreatment comparisons. The primary objective will be supported by [CONTACT_290942] A. The four cohorts will not be compared statistically for
anyendpoint.

8. GENERA LCONSIDERA TIONS FOR DATAANAL YSES
Analy sisdatasets will be created according to CDISC/ADaM standards, and data will be
listed and summarized according to [COMPANY_004] Integrated Data Standards Library (IDSL)
reporting standards. Formatting for dates, times, and decimal places will follow [COMPANY_004]
standards except where specified.
The currently supported versions of SAS, S- Plus software, and TSCG (for figures) will
be used to perform all data analy ses,generate tables, figures, and listings.
Alldata in the database will be presented in by-subject data listings.
All data up to the time of study completion orwithdrawal from the study will be included
in the analy sis,regardless of duration of treatment.
As the duration of treatment for agiven subject will depend on efficacy and tolerability ,
the duration of follow-up will vary between subjects. Consequently ,there will be no
imputation for missing data.
Usethecenter IDinsummaries andlistings, as needed. Summary tables and listings will 
NOT generally be separated by [CONTACT_290943] a factor in any
statistical models.  Unless otherwise stated, all listings will be sorted by[CONTACT_384] I D,
subject number, cohort, then by[CONTACT_290944].
Unless otherwise stated, continuous variables willbesummarized with n,mean, median,
standard deviation, minimum andmaximum, andcategorical variables willbe 
summarized with frequency counts and percentages.
Summaries will be produced by[CONTACT_9084].
All laboratory data will be presented in [COMPANY_004]’s standard units for reporting.
”Worst -case post-baseline” values will be derived using scheduled and unscheduled visits.
Planned times relative to study drug dosing will be used in all tables and summary figures.
14CONFIDENTIA L
BRF117277
Generally , only pre-specified planned times will be used in the summaries, statistical
analy sesand calculations of an yderived parameters andunscheduled readings willbe
listed. However, both unscheduled and scheduled readings will be included in the 
computation of maximum toxicity and in post -baseline shifts display s forlabsandinany
listing.
Assessment windows will not be defined for the purpose of classify ingmeasurements
obtained outside scheduled assessment times.
Deviations from the analyses inthe RAP will be identified in the CSR.
8.1. Multicenter Studies
Data from allparticipating centers willbepooled prior toanaly sis.Itis anticipated that
subject accrual will be spread thinly across centers and summaries of data by [CONTACT_290945], therefore, beprovided. However, a
summary of treated subjects by[CONTACT_290946].
8.2. Other Strata andCovariates
In all efficacy analy ses, there is no stratification. There are no formal plans for
investigating anycovariates.
8.3. Examination ofSubgroups
There are no formal plans for examining subgroups except reporting adverse events by
[CONTACT_290947] (<65 years old and 65 yearsold).
8.4. Multiple Comparisons andMultiplicity
The Type Ierror rate will not be adjusted for multiplicity  in secondary  or supporting
analy ses.

BRF117277
9. DATAHANDLING CONVENTIONS
9.1. Premature Withdrawal andMissing Data
Because study treatment is dependent on the study endpoints (e.g., progression), the
length of treatment for each subject will depend on the efficacy andtoxicity of the 
treatment, so the duration of treatment will vary across subjects. Similarly the duration of
follow upwill also vary .All available time-to-event data will be analy zedusing suitable
statistical methods; subjects with shorter treatment andfollow -updue to the natural
history of their disease or medical necessities of the treatment of their disease will not be
considered to have missing time -to-event data. For endpoints which determine the
percentage of responders, subjects with unknown or missing best overall response will be
assumed to be non -responders, and will be included in the denominator when calculating
the percentages.
In the event that the study is terminated , all available data will be listed and a review 
carried out by [CONTACT_290948].
Missing data occurs when any requested data is not provided, leading to blank fields on 
the collection in strument. These data will be indicated by [CONTACT_2224] a “blank” in subject
listing display s.Answers such as “Not applicable” and “Not evaluable” are not
considered to be missing data and should be displayed as such.
Subjects with the designation of treatment relationship for adverse events (AE)s and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) missing willhave theworst case assumed to impute the
relationship: if relationship to study treatment ismissing itwillbeassumed tobe“Yes”.
There willbe no other impu tation formissing data other than what’s described in Section
9.2forpartial dates and for missing exposure end dates.
9.2. Deriv edandTransformed Data
The following sections provide a general description of the derived and transformed
variables used to describe and analy zethe data. Separate analy sis dataset specifications
provide full details on all data derivations and transformations including descriptions of
core standard algorithms and standard Oncology algorithms. The analy sisdataset
specifications will clearly communicate the content and source of the datasets supporting
the statistical analy ses.
9.2.1. Reference dates
There arethree reference dates:
Because age is an eligibility requirement, the reference date for age is the date of 
screening.
The safety reference date is the treatment start date, and will be used to calculate study
dayfor safet ymeasures.
16CONFIDENTIA L
BRF117277
The efficacy reference date is the treatment start date an d will be used to calculate study  
dayfor efficacy measures and baseline characteristics (such as time since initial 
diagnosis), as well as efficacy durations.
9.2.2. Study Day for Safety Measures
Ifthedate ofinterest occurs on or after thesafet yreference date then the safety study day
will be calculated as (date of interest - safety reference date) + 1.If the date of interest
occurs before the safety reference date then the safety study daywill be calculated as
(date of interest –safety reference date). There is no safet ystudy day0.
9.2.3. Study  Day  forEfficacy
If the date of interest occurs on or after the efficacy reference date then efficacy study day
will be calculated as (date of interest -efficacy reference date) + 1. If the date of interest
occurs prior to the efficacy reference date then efficacy study daywill be calculated as
(date of interest –efficacy reference date). There isno efficacy study day0.
9.2.4. Duration and Elapsed Time
Durations (e.g., the duration of an adverse event, duration of exposure, etc.) are
calculated as the stop date minus the start date plus one.
For elapsed time (e.g., thetime since initial diagnosis):
Ifthe reference date is on or after the event date, then the elapsed time is the
reference date minus the event dat e + 1.
Ifthe reference date is before the event date then the elapsed time is the reference
date minus the event date.
When reporting time to event (TTE) durations (progression -free survival, duration of
intracranial, extracranial, and overall response, overall survival) in months, divide the
number of day sby30.4375; to report in weeks divide the number of daysby7; to report
inyears divide the number of daysby365.25. These algorithms for time to event return
decimal numbers, and ignore the actual n umbers of day sin the months or yearsbetween
start date and stop date. The "year"used in these algorithms is 365.25 day s long, and the
"month" is one twelfth of that year.
For converting all other durations (e.g., duration ofadverse events, duration of exposure,
age) to weeks, months or years usethefollowing:
To report the duration in weeks, divide the number of day sby7.
To report the duration in months use:
(YEAR(stopdate +1) -YEAR(startdate)) *12 +(MONTH(stopdate +1) -
month(startdate) -1) + (DAY(stopdate +1) >= DAY(startdate))
To report the duration in years use:
17CONFIDENTIA L
BRF117277
intck('y ear', startdate, stopdate + 1) - (month(stopdate + 1) < month(startdate) or
(month(stopdate + 1) = month(startdate) and day(stopdate + 1) < day(startdate)))
Thealgorithms above for age and duration return whole numbers for months and years,
accurately  accounting for the actual numbers of days in the months or years between the
start date and the stop date.
9.2.5. Imputation of Partial Dates
Imputed partial dates will not be used to derive study day,duration (e.g., duration of
adverse events), or elapsed time variables. In addition, imputed dates are not used for
deriving the last contact [CONTACT_290949].
With the exception of new anti-cancer start date onthe Oncology time to event anal ysis
dataset and exposure end date on the Exposure analy sis dataset, imputed dates will also
not be stored on datasets.
Imputed dates will not be display ed in listings. However, where necessary ,display
macros may impute dates as temporary variables for the purpose of sorting data in listings 
only.In addition partial dates may beimputed forspecific analy sispurposes as outlined
below.
The partial date imputation will follow ADaM conventions. The ADaM approach is to
populate the numeric date variables with the imputed date and add a flag variable to the 
dataset that indicates the level of imputation.
The flag variable can contain the values: blank, 'D', 'M', 'Y'.
blank: indicates that no imputation was done
D='Day': indicates that the day portion of the date is imputed
M='Month': indicates that the month and day portions of the date are imputed 
Y='Year': indicates that the entire date (year,month, and day)is imputed
Example of Date Variables:
XYZD_ -character date variable
XYZDT -numeric date variable
XYZDTFL -flag variable
Details on imputing partial dates for specific datasets follow.
Adverse Events (AE):
Imputations intheadverse events dataset are used for slotting events to the appropriate
study time periods and for sorting in data listings.

The date of new anti -cancer therapy is derived as the earliest date of new anti-cancer
therapy (e.g., chemotherapy ),radiotherap y(where applicable), or acancer -related
surgical procedure (where applicable) and will include imputed dates. Ifthe date of new
anti-cancer therapy  is an imputed date, then the date of new anti -cancer therapy flag
variable is assigned the value of 'D' to indicate that the day portion of the date is imputed 
(following ADaM convention).
As multiple dates are used to derive the date of new anti -cancer therapy ensure that the
date of new anti -cancer therapy  flag isonly set to ‘D’ if the derived date is imputed. For
example if the date of new radiotherapy  is imputed but the date of new anti -cancer
therapy isprior to date of new radiotherap yand the new anti -cancertherapy date is not a
partial date then the flagshould be set to missing as the date used for the new anti-cancer
therapy is not an imputed date.
9.2.6. Imputation ofMissing Exposure End Dates
The rules for imputing missing exposure end dates given in this section apply to both
dabrafenib and trametinib.  Thestudy treatment end date variable will hold the last date
of exposure for either dabrafenib or trametinib, that is, the latest exposure end date across
all study treatments.
In general, completely missing dates are not imputed. However, subjects in oncology
trials may still be on study treatment when analy ses are performed and so may have
missing exposure end dates in their last dosing record. Missing exposure end dates for
subjects who are still on study treatment at the time of an analy siswill be imputed. For
subjects with missing exposure end dates at the time of data cutoff, the exposure end date
willbeimputed totheearliest of:the date of the data cutoff, the date of withdrawal from
the study ,or the death date. The imputed exposure end date will be used to calculate
cumulative dose and exposure duration. The imputed exposure end date will be stored in
the ex posure analy sisdataset and an exposure end date imputation flag variable will be
derived indicating which exposure end date records are imputed. Imputed exposure end
dates will also be stored on the study treatment end date variable.
For subjects who have missing end dates in their last exposure record because they are 
still on study treatment, the on -therapy indicator variables (time in relation to study
treatment) are assigned to on- therapy  for all records where the 'dataset'.'date' is after or on
the study treatment start date.
9.2.7. Baseline Definition
Baseline will be defined as the most recent, non- missing value prior tooronthefirst
study treatment dose date. For laboratory data, baseline willbedefined asthemost recent,
non-missing value from a central laboratory prior to or on the first study treatment dose
date. If there are no central labs collected for asubject and lab test prior to or on the first
dose of study treatment, the most recent, non-missing value from a local laboratory prior
to or on the first dose of study treatment will be def ined as the baseline value.
For subjects who did not receive study treatment during the study ,baseline will be
defined asthelatest, non- missing collected value.
24CONFIDENTIA L
BRF117277
9.2.8. Change from baseline
Change from baseline will be presented for safety data as described in Section 12.
Change from baseline is calculated as:
For records occurring after baseline: (visit value) –baseline value.
Percent change from baseline is calculated as:
For records occurring after baseline: ((change from baseline) /baseline value) *100
If either the baseline or visit value is missing, the change from baseline and/or percent
change from baseline is set to missing as well.
9.2.9. Multiple Assessments
Alldata will be reported according to the nominal visit date for which it was reported
(that is, no visit windows willbeapplied during dataset creation). Unscheduled data will
only be included in the display sections that report worst -case post-baseline.
If multiple assessments on different daysare reported for the same scheduled assessment,
then the earliest assessment for that scheduled assessment will be analy zed.
If multiple assessments are reported on the same date for the same scheduled planned
time, then the worst -case result will be anal yzed, with the exception of laboratory data
reported from both central and local laboratories. If laboratory data is reported from both
central and local laboratories with the same date, then the central laboratory data will be 
analy zedto provide consistency with measurements from other subjects.
Data from all assessments (scheduled and unscheduled), including multiple assessments, 
will be included in listings.
9.2.10. ActualTreatment
The subjects’ actual treatment will be derived from exposure data. If asubject’s actual
treatment is the same as the assigned treatment, then actual treatment is the assigned
treatment. If asubject receives astudy treatment that is different from the assigned
treatment for the entire time of treatment, then actual treatment is the treatment actually
received.
9.2.11. Extended Loss to Follow -up or Extended Time without an
Adequate Assessment
Iftwo or more consecutive scheduled disease assessments are missed and are then
followed by[CONTACT_290950], PFS will be censored at the last adequate
assessment prior to PD or death. When the scheduled disease assessment is every 8
weeks, a window of 119 days(16 weeks + 7daywindow) will be used to determine
whether there was an extended time without adequate assessment. That is, if the time
difference between the PFS event of PD or death and the last adequate assessment is
25CONFIDENTIA L

more than [ADDRESS_354885] adequate assessment prior to 
the PFS event. IftheWeek 4andWeek 8disease assessments areboth missed orare
inadequate (that is, the first adequate disease assessment is at Week 16), and the Week
16 disease assessment shows progressive disease, then PFS will be set to Day 1.
9.2.12. Date Associated with Response
For each disease assessment after baseline, determine thedates associated with
intracranial, extracranial, and overall response. For anytype of complete response (CR)
or partial response (PR), assign to the latest date within the disease assessments. For any
type of stable disease (SD), Non-CR/Non -PD or Not Evaluable, assign to the earliest date
within the disease assessments. For anytypeof progressive disease (PD), assign to the
earliest assessment date associated with the progression.
9.2.13. Cardiac Scan Modalities (ECHO/MUGA )
The same modality  (ECHO or MUGA) for determining cardiac scan data (e.g., left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) should be used to follow a subject throughout the
study .The absolute change from baseline values wil l not be calculated foranysubjects
where the post -baseline value was determined b y acardiac scan modality that is different
than the one used to determine baseline value.

start ofnew anti-cancer therapy . This will be based on investigator -assessed best over all
response.
Stable disease requires meeting the SD criteria forboth intracranial andextracranial
disease at least once after the first dose of study treatment at aminimum interval of [ADDRESS_354897] overall response will also be summarized.
Subjects with Not Evaluable (NE) or missing overall response will be treated as non-

response isbased onall(that is, intracranial and extracranial) target lesions, up to [ADDRESS_354898] diameters of all intracranial and extracranial target lesions will be
used todetermine overall response. Unequivocal new intracranial or extracranial (or 
both) lesions, or unequivocal intracranial or extracranial (or both) non- target lesion
progression indicate overall progression. Target, non-target, and new lesion responses
are co mbined as for intracranial and extracranial response to determine response at each 
disease assessment and best overall response.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all intracranial and extracranial target
lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be <10mm in the short axis.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum ofthediameters of
intracranial and extracranial target lesions, taking asareference, the baseline sum of 
the intracranial and extracranial diameters (e.g. percent change from baseline).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify forPR nor sufficient
increase to qualify for progressive disease.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a20% increase in the sum of the diameters of
intracranial and extracranial target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of 
intracranial and extracranial diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g.,
38CONFIDENTIA L

percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters 
recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase 
from nadir of 5mm.
Not Evaluable (NE): Cannot be classified b yone of the five preceding definitions.
Intracranial, Extracranial, and Overall Disease Control in Cohorts A, B, C, and D
The intracranial disease control (IDC), extracranial disease control (EDC), andoverall 
disease control (ODC) are defined as CR+PR+SD for intracranial, extracranial, and
overall disease control, respectively .Disease control rates aredefined asthepercentage
of subjects achieving a confirmed overall CR or PR, or SD for at least 8 weeks from the
start of study treatment, from the start of treatment until disease progression or the start of 
new anti -cancer therapy .This will be based on investigator -assessed responses.

when calculating the percentage.
Exact 95% CI sfor the disease control rates will be calculated.
Duration of Intracranial, Extracranial, and Overall Response in Cohorts A, B, C, and D
Duration of intracranial, extracranial, and overall response will be summarized separately
for subjects with a confirmed of intracranial, extracran ial,or overall CR or PR and is
defined as the time (in months) from the initial response (CR/PR) to first documented 
disease progression or death due to anycause. This will be based on responses from the
investigator assessment. Censoring rules will follow those of the primary PFS analy sis
defined in Section 11.1.
If sample size permits, the median duration of response will be calculated from the 
Kaplan -Meier estimates. First andthird quartiles willalsobecalculated along with
associated 95% confidence intervals if there are a sufficient number of responders who 
subsequently progress or die due to any cause.

Progression -Free Survival in Cohorts A, B, C, and D
Progre ssion -Free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval of time (in months) between the
date of first dose of study treatment and the earliest of the date of overall disease
progression and the date of death due to anycause. Disease progression will be based on
assessments by[CONTACT_093].
39CONFIDENTIA L
BRF117277
Thedate ofdocumented disease progression willbedefined asthedate ofoverall disease
progression based on imaging data. The date of death will be taken from the Record of
Death page. Death on study duetoanycause will beused.
Subjects who progressed or died after an extended period without adequate intracranial
and extracranial assessment will be censored at their date of last adequate intracranial and
extracranial assessment prior to progression or death even if subsequent information is
available regarding intracranial or extracranial progression or death. An adequate
assessment isdefined as
anassessment where theinvestigator -determined response isCR,
PR, or S D. The date of response at that assessment will be used for censoring. Because
the assessment schedule changes during study treatment, specific rules for identify ing
extended loss to follow -up or extended time without an adequate assessment are provided
inSection 9.
If anti -cancer therapy is started without documented overall disease progression or is
started prior to documented overall disease progression, then PFS will be censored at the
date of the last adequate assessment that is on or before the date of 
initiation of anti -
cancer therapy (i.e., if an assessment occurs on the same day as the start of new anti -
cancer therapy  the assessment will be used). The date of response at the last adequate
assessment will be used as the censoring value.
If a subject has only a baseline visit or does not have an adequate assessment that is on or
before the date of initiation of anti -cancer therapy , PFS will be censored at the date of
first dose of study treatment.
Ifasubject hasneither progressed nordied norstarted new anti-cancer therapy ,then PFS
will be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment defined as an assessment 
where theinvestigator -assessed response  is CR, PR, SD. The date of response will be
used as the censoring date.

lab tests that are gradable by [CONTACT_3989] v4.0. These summaries will display the number and 
percentage of subjects with post-baseline grade increases from their baseline grade. Any
increase in grade from baseline will be summarized along with anyincrease to a
maximum grade of [ADDRESS_354900] is counted in 
both the “Decrease to Low” categories and the “Increase to High” categories. Inaddition,
the summary will include worst case changes from baseline with respect tonormal range
by[CONTACT_177328].
Separate summary tables for hematology ,chemistry, and liver function laboratory tests
will be produced. Coagulation test results at baseline will be summarized.
Alisting of selected laboratory tests and grades will be provided.  A supporting listing of
laboratory data for subjects with values outside the normal range will be provided. A
separate listing of laboratory data with character values will also be provi ded.
Detailed derivation of baseline assessment is specified in Section 9.2.7 .
Unless otherwise specified, the denominator in percentage calculation at each scheduled
visit will be based on the number of subjects with non-missing value at each particular
visit.
Coagulation tests only collected at baseline. Therefore these tests will not appear in an y
summaries of changes from baseline.
12.7.1. Analysesof Liver Function Tests
Summaries of hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities including possible Hy’slaw cases
willbeprovided inaddition towhat hasbeen described above.
Possible Hy ’slaw cases are defined as anyelevated ALT>3×ULN, total
bilirubin ≥2×ULN and ALP<3×ULN/missing. Total bilirubin ≥2×ULN can be within [ADDRESS_354901] be ≥ 35% of total bilirubin. ALP<3xULN/missing means the criteria is satisfied
unless the ALP is ≥3xULN at any time of bilirubin elevation within the [ADDRESS_354902] deviation, minimum and maximum.
In addition vital signs values will be categorized as follows:
Systolic BP (mmHg): Grade 0(<120), Grade 1 (≥120 -<140), Grade 2 (≥140 -<160)
and Grade 3 (≥160)
Diastolic BP (mmHg): Grade 0 (<80), Grade 1 (≥80-<90), Grade 2 (≥90-<100), and
Grade 3 (≥100)
Heart rate (beats/min): <60, 60-100, and >100
Temperature (°C): <35, 35<= and < 38,≥[ADDRESS_354903] -baseline changes
during the study .
Asupporting listing willalsobeprovided.
ECG
The summaries for the QTc will use the collected value only.
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects who had normal and abnormal 
(clinically significant and not clinically significant) ECG findings will be display ed by
[CONTACT_290969] -baseline.
49CONFIDENTIA L
BRF117277
The QTc values based on Bazett’s formula will be rounded to the integer and the values
will be categorized into the following ranges: Grade 0 (<450), Grade 1 (450-480), Grade
2 (481-500), and Grade 3 (≥501).   A summary of grade shifts from baseline value for
each scheduled assessment time and in the worst case post-baseline will be provided.
Summaries of grade increase will be provided. These summaries will display the number
and percentage ofsubjects with any grade increase and increase to grade [ADDRESS_354904]-baseline.
Thechanges inQTc values willbecategorized intotheclinical concern ranges which are
specific to changes in QTc: 31-60and >[ADDRESS_354905]-baseline. Subjects with missing
baseline values will be excluded from this summary.
Listings of abnormal ECG findings and a listing of ECG values will be provided. In
addition, a listing the QTc data for subjects in each cohort an absolute QTcB interval
501 (Grade 3) and an increase from baseline QTcB of >60 at an ytime in the on -therapy
period (that is, these values do not have to be at the same assessment but the subject must 
be on study treatment or within [ADDRESS_354906] dose of study treatment) will be
produced.
A figure plotting the baseline QTc and the worst -case post -baseline values will be
produced. The figure will have reference lines at 450 and 500 msec for both the ordinate
and the abscissa axes. There will be diagonal reference lines at equality (i.e., a45 degree
line), at equality plus 30msec, and at equality plus [ADDRESS_354907]-baseline assessments
that used the same method (ECHO or MUGA) as the baseline assessments will be used to
derive the change from baseline. The change from baseline will be categorized as
follows:
Any increase
No change
Any decrease:
o0 -<10% Decrease
o10 -<20% Decrease
o≥20% D ecrease
≥10% decrease and ≥LLN
≥10% decrease and <LLN
>10% decrease and < LLN

LVEF results willalsobelisted with subject level details including absolute change from 
baseline.
Liver Events
Forany liver events that occur during the study ,the liver event information for RUCUM
score will be summarized, including whether the subject was age [ADDRESS_354908] took any
unconventional medications, timing when theevent occurs (while ontreatment orafter 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]) and summary statistics for time from first dose to star t of liver event 
and time from last dose to start of liver event. If the number of events does not support a 
summary , then only listings will be produced.
For subjects with multiple events, the first event will be used for the summary tables. All 
events w ith subject level details will be display ed inasupporting listing.
Ocular Exams
Baseline and Week 4data will be summarized based on the number and percentage of
subjects who receive an ocular exam. Because post-baseline exams are only performed as
clinically indicated, data beyondWeek 4 will only  be listed.

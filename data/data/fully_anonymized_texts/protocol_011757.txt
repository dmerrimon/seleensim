7 Protocol Synopsis  
 
Protocol Title:  Rapid Identification and Phenotypic Susceptibility Testing for Gram - 
Negative Bacteremia ( RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852] -GN) 
Study Design:  Multi-center , prospective, randomized,  controlled  trial to evaluate the following 
strategies for patients with confirmed gram -negative bacillus bacteremia:  
 
1) Standard culture and antimicrobial  susceptibility testing ( AST); or  
2) Rapid identification and AST  using the Accelerate PhenoTest ™ BC Kit, 
performed on the Accelerate Pheno ™ System  (AXDX)  
Primary Study 
Objectives:  To evaluate the impact of rapid identification and AST on time to first antibiotic 
modification in the first [ADDRESS_1037628] on antimicrobial utilization 
and clinical outcomes . 
• 30-day mortality  
• Length of stay  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Days in the ICU  
• Duration of broad- spectrum gram -negative coverage in the first 72 hours 
following randomization  
• Mean time to antibiotic escalation  
• Mean time to antibiotic de- escalation  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -onset Clostridium difficile  
• Acquisition of new hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acqui red infections (HAIs) and/or multidrug 
resistant organisms (MDROs)  
Study Population  All patients  with blood culture bottles growing  gram -negative bacilli ( GNB ) 
detected on Gram staining will be eligible   
Number of subjects  500 subjects  
Number of sites  2 sites 
Clinical Samples  Clinically collected b lood cultures with growth of GNB  detected by [CONTACT_758033] : October  2017  
End of 
Enrollment:  October [ADDRESS_1037629] of rapid bacterial  identification and phenotypic 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) on antimicrobial usage and clinical outcomes .  
 
The Accelerate PhenoTest ™ BC Kit, performed on the Accelerate Pheno ™ System (together 
termed AXDX)  (Accelerate Diagnostics, Tucson, AZ)  is an FDA -approved fully automated 
platform that performs rapid bacterial identification within 1.5  hours followed by [CONTACT_758034] (MIC) -based phenotypic susceptibility  within approximately 7 
hours directly from positive blood cultures.1 This novel  system uses fluorescence in situ  
hybridization (FISH) for rapid bacterial identification for a panel of organisms followed by  [CONTACT_5586]-
lapse microscopy for determining phenotypic AST directly from positive blood culture bottles  (see 
Table 1) . In a study of [ADDRESS_1037630] overall 97.4% sensitivity and  99.3% specificity for organism 
identification compared to conventional culture methods  (see Table 2) . Among 728 gram -negative 
isolates, AXDX had 97.6% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity for pathogen identification, and had 
excellent essential  (device result  agrees exactly with or within one two- fold dilution of the 
reference result)  and categorical (the device and reference result interpretive categories agree)   
agreement with the gold- standard methods  for drug susceptibility testing , according to Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA) and/or Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) breakpoints  
(see Table 3 )1.

1.2 Scientific Rationale  
 
Bacter emia due to gram -negative bacilli (GNB) poses a dangerous threat due to increasing rates 
of resistance and high mortality with ineffective antibiotic therapy .2-[ADDRESS_1037631] turn- around- time for clinical microbiology 
laboratories to isolate, identify, and perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacterial  
isolates is [ADDRESS_1037632] to temporal trends, single-
center, and uncontrolled. A previous single- center , randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that  
rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based identification paired with antimicrobial stewardship 
intervention was associated with more rapid anti biotic de -escalation, shorter time to appropriate 
antibiotic therapy , and less use of broad- spectrum antibioti cs.[ADDRESS_1037633] detected only a single GNB resistance determinant ( blaKPC), and did not provide 
rapid phenotypic susceptibility information for a full panel of antibiotics.  
 
Accelerate’s AXDX is the first FDA -approved platform to provide both identification and rapid 
phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility  testing of organisms  directly  from positive blood cultures.  We 
will evaluate the clinical impact of AXDX  testing for GNB bacteremia in a multicente r, prospective, 
randomized, controlled clinical trial. This study will evaluate the impact of AXDX testing in the 
setting of baseline antimicrobial stewardship activities, because current regulations mandate that 
all acute care settings have antimicrobial stewardship programs ,16,[ADDRESS_1037634] on 
antibiotic u tilization and clinical outcomes . 
 
4.0 Study Design  
 
This study will be  a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled  trial evalua ting antimicrobial 
utilization and clinical outcomes among patients with GNB  bacteremia.  Patients will be 
randomized to one of the following arms:   
 
1. Standard culture and AST  
2. Rapid identification and AST using AXDX  
 
Baseline antimicrobial stewardship will occur in both arms. The blood sample for arm [ADDRESS_1037635] in addition to the rapid testing.  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
Patients who meet the following inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, will 
be included in the study:   
• Positive blood culture with Gram stain showing  GNB identified during local laboratory 
business hours.  
 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
  
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:   
RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852] -GN  Version 4.0  
 November 30, 2018  
  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
11 • Identification of GNB outside of local laboratory business hours  (e.g. whenever 
laboratories are staffed to perform both rapid testing and routine testing)   
• Positive blood c ulture for GNB at the same institution  within prior 7 days  (if 
known at the time of randomization) .  
• Deceased at the time of randomization .  
 GNB  plus gram -positive organism , gram -negative cocci,  and/or yeast  detected 
on Gram stain  
 Previous enrollment in this study  
• No Minnesota research authorization ([COMPANY_002]ster site only)   
 
If the patient does not meet any of the above exclusion criteria, he/she will be 
randomized, and laboratory testing will be performed according to group assigment.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1037636] is not being evaluated for its diagnostic accuracy (which has been determined by 
[CONTACT_758035]), but rather to determine whether its use in the clinical setting can improve quality of patient care.  
 
5.2 Randomization  
 
Patients meeting enrollment criteria will be assigned, in a 1:1 ratio using permuted 
blocks , to one of the two arms outlined in Section 4.0. The randomization scheme will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  Randomization will occur  at the time the Gram stain detecting GNB is 
identified  by [CONTACT_38768]. Randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_758036] , 
using an electronic system.  
 
5.3 Interventions  
 5.3.1  Notifications  
 
Once study group is assigned, the L aboratory  Technologists will immediately  notify the 
Study Coordinator via electronic or telephone page.  The Study Coordinator will then 
notify the Antimicrobial Stewardship ( AS) team that a subject has been randomized to 
either arm . Each subject’s medical record number, group assignment and subject ID w ill 
be recorded in an electronic log.  
 For subjects in both arms, t he Laboratory Technologist s will notify ordering clinicians by 
[CONTACT_758037] , as is done in routine clinical 
practice.  
 Sites are responsible for  notifying  appropriate agencies of  reportable infectious diseases 
per institutional policy.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1037637] as well as 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry  (MALDI -TOF MS ). If the 
primary or AS team s desire to have additional drug susceptibility information that is not 
routinely  reported, they may req uest this information from the Microbiology Laboratory.  
 
If standard culture methods detect a gram -positive organism , gram -negative cocci, and/or  
yeast instead of a gram -negative organism ( as was originally detected on Gram stain) , 
the culture result will be reported in the medical record, as per standard of care, and the 
subject will be considered unevaluable as he or she will not have GNB bacteremia.   
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1037638] of care testing. If no targ ets are identified using the rapid testing panel  (see 
Table 1, Section 1.1) , then identification and AST will be done through standard methods 
only. Combinations of bacteria/antibiotics that are reported by [CONTACT_758038]. GNB/antibiotic 
combinations that are not reported by [CONTACT_758039] , but are routinely reported by [CONTACT_758040], will be added to the final AST report for study patients.  
 
If there is disagr eement between the rapid AST and the standard AST  results , any 
“intermediate” or “resistant” result will be reported, regardless of testing method. T he 
primary  team  caring for the patient  will be notified by [CONTACT_758041], and 
additional susceptibility testing will be performed as needed and determined by [CONTACT_758042] D irector . Discrepant  results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_758043] 6.0.  If the primary  or AS teams desire to have additional 
drug susceptibility information that is not reported by [CONTACT_758044], 
they may request this inf ormation from the Microbiology Laboratory.  
 If the AXDX assay detects a gram -positive organism , gram -negative cocci, and/ or yeast 
(that was not originally noted on Gram stain) in addition to GNB , the laboratory 
technologist will review the Gram stain. If the gram -positive organism or yeast is seen 
upon review, the following FDA -approved gram -positive  or yeast  organism identifications 
along with AST  will be reported in the medical record: Staphylococcus aureus, 
Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata,  
coagulase- negative staphylococci, Enterococcus  species, Streptococcus  species.  If the 
gram -positive bacteria or yeast is not seen upon review of the Gram stain, the AXDX 
result will not be reported, as this test is not FDA approved for clinical use if organisms 
are not visualized by [CONTACT_672044].  If the AXDX assa y detects a gram -positive organism , 
gram -negative cocci, and/ or yeast instead of GNB  (as was originally detected on Gram 
stain ), the AXDX result will not be reported. In these cases, if standard culture  methods 
detect other organisms instead of GNB , the standard culture result will be reported in the 
medical record, and the subject will be considered unevaluable as he or she will not have 
GNB bacteremia.   
5.3.[ADDRESS_1037639]’s  
microbiology results  and medical records . The AS provider will contact [CONTACT_758045] (or the consulting infectious diseases  (ID) physician, if applicable) if modifications 
RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852] -GN  Version 4.0  
 November 30, 2018  
  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
13 to therapy are indicated,  at any time following notification of positive Gram stain result, 
organism  identification,  and/or AST results . If the ID service is consulting on the subject, 
the AS team will contact [CONTACT_758046]. If the rapid test 
result is ready when the AS team is unavailable (i.e. in the evening or weekend), the AS 
team will review the record and make recommendations at the beginning of the following 
working day. Local institutional treatment guidelines will be followed. Recommendations 
will be communicated to the treating teams via telephone or pager and documented per 
institutional standards. Recommendation types and acceptance rates will be recorded in 
the study database.  Categories of recommendations include: intravenous to oral 
conversion, de -escalation of gram  negative coverage, de- escalation of gram  positive 
coverage, escalation of gram  negative coverage, escalation of gram  positive coverage, 
dose optimization, discontinuation of therapy, therapeutic drug monitoring, reduce/define duration of therapy, ID consultation , and other . More than one stewardship 
recommendation category may be chosen.  
 
In addition to prospective audit and feedback , other routine institutional AS activities will 
continue, such as  implementation of institutional treatment guidelines , prior authorization 
of restricted antibiotics, review of all patients on selected antibiotics with feedback to 
clinicians, and daily review o f specific culture results.  
 
5.4       Blinding  
 
Primary service/provider: The primary service, including the prescribing provider, will be 
unaware of group assignment at the time of randomization, so initial antibiotic choice will 
not be affected by [CONTACT_70973]. O nce rapid results become available and/or AS 
interventions  are made, treating providers may become aware of group assignment.  
 
The AS team and laboratory technologists will not be blinded.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1037640] ( EMR ) and are done as routine standard of care practice.  
 
5.5.1  Baseline Assessment  
   
Once a patient is randomized, information about the patient’s demographics, comorbid conditions, severity of illness  (e.g. components of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_750565]
18-20), and 
microbiology  and antimicrobial suscep tibility  results will be recorded.  Whether a patient is 
on comfort care will be recorded, as determined by [CONTACT_758047] (e.g. Palliative Care).  
 5.5.2  Daily Evaluations  
 
Information about additional microbiology results  and antibiotic treatment will be gathered 
from the EMR  during the three days following randomization.  Suspected source and site 
of infection will be recorded by [CONTACT_758048] . 
 5.5.3  Antibiotic spectrum and antibiotic intensity score  
 
The antibiotic intensity score will be determined as follows: Each antibiotic is assigned an 
antibiotic spec trum rank from 1- 5 (see Table 4). The antibiotic rank will be multipled by 
[CONTACT_758049]  (in hours ) within the first [ADDRESS_1037641] dose  (or time of randomization, if subject 
was receiving antibiotic at  randomization) plus one hour . Patients who die before [ADDRESS_1037642] -generation cephalosporins,

7.2.3  Exploratory Analyses  
 
• Standardized costs, obtained from the UHC/Vizient database  
• The primary endpoint  will be analyzed comparing patients who are: 
o in the ICU at baseline versus not in the ICU at baseline 
o neutropenic at baseline versus not neutropenic at baseline  
• The primary endpoint will be analyzed excluding antibiotic modifications made within 
the first hour after randomization, as these changes may be in response to Gram 
stain result rather than AXDX result  
• 30-day readmission to the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• The proportion of discrepancies (as detai led in 6.0) between rapid testing and 
standard of care testing among subjects who receive rapid testing (arm 2)  
• Antibiotic intensity score (as detailed in 5.5.3)  in the first [ADDRESS_1037653] randomization

**Newly acquired within [ADDRESS_1037654] 72 hours after randomization.  We plan to enroll 500 unique participants 
(250 in each arm) in order to have at least 200 evaluable participants in each arm . Participants 
who died prior to randomization,  were on comfort care at time of randomization, had GNB 
bacteremia at same or different  institution within 7 days  prior to randomization, or who were 
erroneously randomized due to laboratory issues such as spurious  Gram stain result, will be 
considered unevaluable. This will provide 80% power with a 2-sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1037655] deviation (SD) of [ADDRESS_1037656] a difference between the arms  of 10 or more 
hours (see Table 8 ).   
 We assume that differences in the primary outcome will be due to the rapid testing results. We 
anticipate that most subjects will be receiving empi[INVESTIGATOR_132327]- spectrum antibiotic therapy at 
randomization, and a difference between the arms of [ADDRESS_1037657] modification of antibiotic therapy  are based 
on data from subjects with GN B bacter emia from the BCID trial
15. We assume that the arm 
including stewardship in the BCID trial (BCID test plus AS) , is a reasonable surrogate for the 
RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_758024]. This is because the BCID test provided minimal s usceptibility 
results for GNB , and did not impact time to antibiotic modifications for subjects with GNB 
bacteremia15. Based on the BCID trial data, in the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_758025], we expect 63% 
will have antibiotic de -escalation with mean time of 31 hours (SD  27), 23% will have antibiotic 
escalation with mean time of 18 hours  (SD 21), and 14%  will have no antibiotic change. 
Incorporating the participants with no change, we expect the overall mean time to change in the 
standard tes ting arm will be 33.75 hours (SD 28.8) .  We anticipate that the rapid testing arm will 
have similar frequencies of antibiotic de -escalation, escalation, and no change. Based on the 
turn-around- time of the rapid test, we estimate that mean time to antibioti c de- escalation and 
escalation will be approximately 12 hours (SD 24) . Incorporating subjects with no antibiotic 
change , we expect the overall  mean time to antibiotic modification in the rapid testing arm will be

Patients who do not have antibiotic modifications  will be assigned a time of [ADDRESS_1037660] ( relying on a normal approximation, allowing for unequal 
variances in the treatment groups) for whether the mean of the primary outcome is different between the  arms. We will also carry out a Wilcoxon rank -sum test , to compare 
the distribution of the time to first antibiotic modification between the arms  without the 
assumption of normality . We will estimate the probability of having an escalation or de-
escalation of antibiotics between 0 and 72 hours after randomization using the empi[INVESTIGATOR_758026] 95% confidence intervals . 
 The primary analysis will be a modified intention to treat analysis (ITT). Participants who 
died prior to randomization,  were on comfort care at randomization as assessed by [CONTACT_33662], had GNB bacteremia at same or different institution within [ADDRESS_1037661] lies in mean differences, we will follow the same 
approach as for the primary outcome. The DOOR s will be compared between arms  to 
estimate the probability (w ith 95% CI) that a randomly selected participant will have a 
better DOOR outcome if assigned to rapid testing . We will determine the proportion of 
very major errors and very major or major errors among patients who recei ve rapid 
testing .

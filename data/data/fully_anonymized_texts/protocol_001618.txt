 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Title:   Evaluation of cigarette package inserts for enhanced 
communication with smokers  
  
Grant Number:  R01 CA215466  
  
Study Description:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the 
influence of cigarette package inserts with messages about the 
benefits of cessation and tips for quitting  on smoking cessation -
related psychosocial and behavioral outcomes .  We 
hypothesized that inserts would promote these outcomes and 
that these effects would be enhanced when cigarette packages 
included both inserts and pi[INVESTIGATOR_128783].   In this 2X2 
between -subject trial (i.e., inserts with efficacy messag es vs. no 
inserts; pi[INVESTIGATOR_791704]. text -only warnings) , participants 
received a [ADDRESS_1091482] their experimental condition . 
 
Objectives:  
 
 
 To evaluate the impact of inserts on smoking cessation -related 
outcomes using a randomized controlled trial among adult 
smokers.   
Endpoint s: Data were collected over 14 days using a study smartphone .  
Participants were instructed to log every cigarette they smoked 
during this period. Approximately 4 -5 times a day, participants 
were prompted to complete a brief, 1 -3 minute survey 
immediately after they indicated that they had smoked, with 
cigarette logs sampled using an algorithm based on self-
reported baseline smoking frequency.  Each evening , between 7 
and midnight, participants were instructed to respond to an 
evening survey using the smartphone app, which took 1 -3 
minutes to complete.  
Primary Endpoint s:  Self-efficacy to Quit Smoking; Self-efficacy 
to Cut Down on Smoking; Worry About Harms from Smoking; 
Strength of Feeling About Smoking; Extent of Motivation to 
Quit; Talk About Smoking Cessation or Harms; Foregoing or 
stubbing out a Cigarette  
Secondary Endpoints :  Strength of Hopefulness About Quitting; 
Satisfaction From Smoking; Cognitive Elaboration of Smoking 
Benefits; Cognitive Elaboration of Smoking Harms; Cognitive 
Elaboration of Cessation Benefits; Response Efficacy; Perceived 
Susceptibility to Smoking Harms;  Cigarettes Per Day  
6 
 Study Population:  Adult smokers in South Carolina and [LOCATION_001] were recruited , 
with efforts to recruit people from lower socioeconomic status 
groups.   Of 1818 people screened, 602 were ineligible , 773 
either declined to participate or were unable to be scheduled 
for orientation, and 443 were eligible and randomized.  Of 
these, 56 did not attend the study orientation, and 20 did not 
complete minimum criteria to be included in the analytic 
sample.  The fi nal analytic sample involved 367 people.  
   
Description of Study 
Intervention /Experimental 
Manipulation : The 2X2 between subject intervention involved randomization 
to one of four groups:  a) control; b) inserts only; c) pi[INVESTIGATOR_791705]; d) inserts and pi[INVESTIGATOR_637064].  Insert  
conditions included four rotating messages, two a bout 
cessation benefits and two with cessation tips .  Warning text 
for all conditions included four  rotating messages , with the 
text-only “control” condition used the current warning s ize and 
placement (i.e., 50% of one pack side), whereas pi[INVESTIGATOR_791706] 50% of the lower half of both 
the front and back of pack s. 
  
Study Duration:  June 28, 2019  to June 29, 2021  
  
Participant Duration:  Study participation involved a 45 -minute study orientation 
where potential participants completed a baseline survey, 
received training in the 14 -day study, and were provided the 
study materials (i.e., smartphone , cigarette packs).  After the 
14-day observation period, participants completed a final 
survey and interview and received compensation.  
 
  
[ADDRESS_1091483]-effective vehicle for governments and industry to communica te with smokers. Reflecting 
this principle, the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 
(FCTC) recommends large, pi[INVESTIGATOR_128792] (HWLs) printed on the exterior of 
cigarette packs to communicate about smoking -related risks.[ADDRESS_1091484] 
adopted pi[INVESTIGATOR_791707],7 but only Canada uses inserts to enhance HWL effectiveness . 
“Inserts” and “onserts” (hereafter “inserts”) are small, 
printed leaflets that are removable material found inside or 
attached to the outside of product packaging (Figure 1). Tobacco 
companies have long used inserts  to reach smokers with 
promotional materials and messaging (e.g., coupons, contests, 
product information).8-10 Smokers are exposed to inserts every 
time they open a new pack, which is much more often than 
inserts for pharmaceutical drugs that are purchased much less 
frequently than cigarettes. Bec ause of their high exposure 
frequency, cigarette inserts need not include all pertinent 
information, allowing for rotating messages that address key limitations of drug inserts (e.g., 
concise, legible, use of imagery).11-[ADDRESS_1091485] of Canadian smokers report reading inserts in the prior 
month,14 which would be equal to 12 million US smokers engaging with insert content each 
month. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulatory authority to use inserts for 
communication with consumers15 and is developi[INVESTIGATOR_791708] 4-[ADDRESS_1091486] in 
mediating HWL effects on cessation -related intentions and behaviors.21-26 However, some 
research and theory cautions that “fear appeals” – like HWLs that graphically portray negative 
health consequences from smoking – may be ineffective w hen people are scared but do not see 
an effective way to avoid the danger that the message highlights.27-36 Rather than quit smoking, 
smokers could deny the relevance of the message (denial), not attend to it (avoidance), or lash 

8 
 out at it in anger (re actance). To minimize such defensive responses to HWLs and maximize 
their desirable effects, empi[INVESTIGATOR_33727]28 [ADDRESS_1091487] no research has assessed whether efficacy messages on labels can promote 
smoking cessation . Our proposed study will fill this critical gap.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Scientific Premise & Conceptual Model  
Our central hypothesis 
is that inserts with 
efficacy messages 
promote smoking 
cessation -related 
outcomes. Other 
primary hypotheses 
(Table 1) follow from 
our conceptual model 
(Figure 2).  Figure [ADDRESS_1091488] 
defensive responses (e.g., 
avoidance, reactance) to 
HWLs. HWLs and inserts 
will interact synergistically. 
HWL -generated negative 

[ADDRESS_1091489] will promote attention to and processing of insert messages (“spotlight” effect). Efficacy 
beliefs generated from inserts (or pre -existing efficacy beliefs) will reduce defensive responses 
to HWLs. Education will modify labeling effects given evidence of stronger responses to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_791709],42 although they fa ce large 
barriers to cessation.43 44 Greater delayed discounting, or valuation of present rewards (e.g., 
nicotine administration) over future rewards (e.g., cessation benefits), is associated with failed 
cessation,45 46 and should reduce label effectiven ess. Finally, labeling effects will vary over time, 
due to both message “wear out”47-49 and the dynamic nature of quit motivation.22 50 51  
Dual system model : We base our conceptual model in dual -system models of decision making, 
which posit that people process information using distinct but interacting modes of thinking.52-
54 The “deliberative mode” is conscious, analytical, and slow, reflecting standard cognitive 
explanations of how people engage with information and make decisions.[ADDRESS_1091490], the 
“experiential mode” involves easier, more rapid and spontaneous feelings about information. 
The “affect heuristic,” wherein decision making is based on “gut” feelings, is based in this 
mode.56 57 Repeated exposures to information shape the feelings that make information 
meaningful and likely to influence people’s decisions.58 59 Deliberative and experiential modes 
are not mutually exclusive, and one may predominate over the other at any moment. In the 
context of repeated message exposures – as with cigarette labels – the relative prominence of 
either mode will va ry over time because of situational and personal factors, including changes 
in motivation to process messages.  
Studies support the central role of negative affect in explaining HWL effects  on 
cessation -related intentions and behaviors. Compared to text -only warnings, prominent 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_791710], including fear, sadness, and disgust,[ADDRESS_1091491] appears more  important than cognitive 
risk perceptions.5 26 60  
Affective responses can function as: 1. information; 2. motivator; and 3. “spotlight”.[ADDRESS_1091492] inhibits behaviors that feel bad or could harm onesel f. This 
“approach -avoidance” function to affect is central to implicit motivation models of HWL 
effects.[ADDRESS_1091493] functions as “information” (e. g., risk perception), “motivator” 
(interpersonal communication about HWLs;49 69 70 reduced smoking satisfaction;71 foregoing 
cigarettes;72-77 reduced cigarettes per day78-81) and “spotlight” (e.g., frequency of thinking about 
risks72 76), all of which can independently predict subsequent cessation behavior .[ADDRESS_1091494] of the “spotlight” function of negative affect , which we expect to 
promote processing of efficacy messages on inserts . This conceptualization is consistent with 
the “emotional flow” of persuasion,82 83 wherein fear appeals (e.g., HWLs encounter ed on the 
pack exterior) are most effective when followed by [CONTACT_791737] (e.g., inserts encountered 
after opening a pack) that generate hope about being able to escape the danger.  
Defensive responses to HWLs : Fear arousing messages can produce “defensive responses” 
(e.g., avoidance, reactance) that, according to some theories, lead to message rejection.[ADDRESS_1091495] found that 
fear arousing HWLs result in greater reactance (i.e., anger from perceived manipulation),[ADDRESS_1091496] critics of pi[INVESTIGATOR_791711].31-34 
Efficacy beliefs and messages : Behavior change theories, such as the Extended Parallel 
Processing Model (EPPM)28 41 and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) ,[ADDRESS_1091497] effective when message recipi[INVESTIGATOR_791712] (i.e., 
response efficacy) and are confident they can engage in this action (i.e., self -efficacy). Indeed, 
self-efficacy to quit predicts cessation behavior,[ADDRESS_1091498] 
been used in experimental research minimally address efficacy 
beliefs by [CONTACT_791738] (e.g., 
quitlines, websites).102-[ADDRESS_1091499] smokers quit without 
using these resources,108-111 whose inclusion on new HWLs in 
Australia did not change smokers’ self -efficacy to quit.[ADDRESS_1091500] -implementation observational studies in Ca nada that found independent effects of 
reading inserts on subsequent sustained smoking cessation (Figure 3).[ADDRESS_1091501] likely to process efficacy messages 

11 
 and, thereby, increase their efficacy beliefs. Consistent with the “spotlight” function of affect53 
and theories of “emotional flow,”[ADDRESS_1091502] prospective randomized controlled t rial (RCT) in the US, 
in which we will evaluate: a) inserts with efficacy messages vs no inserts; and b) fear arousing

4 STUDY POPULATION  
Participant eligibility:  
• Legal age to purchase cigarettes, which started at 18 but wa s changed to 21 years old 
(December 20, 2019) after  the federal government increased the legal age of tobacco 
purchase;  
• Smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their life;  
• Smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day, to ensure exposure to four rotating labels in each 
treatment condition ; 
• Exhaled carbon monoxide o f at least 8ppm to confirm smoking status, using COVITA.  
After the onset of COVID -19, this criterion was eliminated due to concerns about COVID 
transmission  while using the COVITA device . 
Participant ineligibility:  
• Use of e -cigarettes, other forms of smoked tobacco (cigars, water pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836], hookah, 
cigarillos, little cigars, pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836]), or smokeless tobacco products (chewing tobacco, snuff, 
dip) in the last month to minimize issues of cross -product substitution, as the study wa s 
not designed to address this issue;  
• Living with someone else who has participated in or was currently participating in this 
two-week study, in order to prevent exposure to the study stimuli;  
• Pregnant or considering becoming pregnant;  
• After the onset of COVID -19 data collection, participants who reported having 
experienced symptoms or having been exposed to COVID -19 in the p rior 30 days.  
4.1 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
12 
 Recruitment and training  differed somewhat across the two recruitment sites:  
University of South Carolina (UofSC) and Cornell University.  Furthermore, after the onset of 
COVID -19, these methods changed to ensure the safety of partic ipants and study personnel.  
The information below describes these differences b y site and time period.  
To enhance protocol compliance and retention, c heck in calls were scheduled for three 
days after orientation and another call six days after orientation  across sites and recruitment 
periods . Text reminders were set up for 24 hours b efore all calls and check ins. Before these 
calls, cigarette log and evening survey data were checked to assess compliance with study 
protocols.  During the calls issues with compliance were discussed, any participant questions 
were answered, and participa nts were reminded of the date and time of the next call and 
follow up. After the second follow up call, participants who logged less than 50% of their 
baseline cigarettes per day or who missed more than one evening report received a third check 
in call.  
Pre-COVID  
UofSC :   From June 28, 2019 to March 5, 2020, participants in Columbia, SC, were recruited 
though advertisements on social media (e.g., Facebook, Craigslist) and flyers, which directed 
participants to a screening survey hosted on RedCap. Eligible p articipants were called to 
confirm eligibility, interest in participating, preferred cigarette brand variety, and to schedule a 
date and time to attend an in -person study orientation at a UofSC lab.  Prior to participants’ 
arrival at the lab, packs of the participant’s preferred brand of cigarette were purchased based 
on the number of cigarettes they smoked per day. These packs were then prepared according 
to their randomized condition with appropriate labels and inserts. Additionally, all cigarette 
packs w ere labeled on the bottom with the number of packs (i.e., if a person received 7 packs, 
they were labeled 1 -7) and placed in a Ziplock bag to maintain freshness.  
Cornell  University :  From July 6, 2019  to December 3, 2019, participants were recruited through 
intercept at smoke shops in 6 locations: Binghamton, Cortland, Ithaca, Newark, Oswego, 
Syracuse. Census data (54) were used to identify areas with lower median household income 
(ranged=$34K - $44K) than the state median ($68K). Sites were selected from the list of 
candidates based the presence of smoke shops that were willing and able to host the mobile 
lab (i.e., had sufficient adjacent parking).  Flyers were posted outside of the smoke shops 
approx imately one week in advance of recruitment, with onsite signage was visible to 
participants at the time of recruitment. The intercept recruitment efforts occurred on 
weekends. At these recruitment efforts, a Cornell University -branded mobile lab (i.e., For d Van) 
with five private research stations and [ADDRESS_1091503] protocol orientation.  After participants were 
screened for eligibility, they commenced with the baseline surve y and study orientation inside 
the mobile lab, while study personnel purchased and prepared the cigarette packs for their 
preferred brand variety with labels reflecting their condition. We limited the number of 
13 
 cigarette packs that participants in NY could  receive to 14 packs due to the extremely high price 
of cigarettes in NY  (i.e., the highest price in the US at $11.96  on average ).  We were concerned 
that this high price would lead to differential participant compensation across study sites and 
potential ly promote over -report ing of baseline smoking among NY participants.     
Both Sites :  At both sites, the in -person study orientation lasted approximately one hour and 
included:  
• Eligibility confirmation with a brief survey and expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559] (>=8ppm) using Covita  
• Study consent  
• Baseline survey (e.g., smoking behaviors, demographics)  
• Baseline interview (social network data, health literacy assessment)  
• Training in use of the study phone and the protocols, including how to log cigarettes, 
the timing of cigarette and evening surveys, what to do if participants missed logs and 
surveys, review of the EMA survey items, and a short quiz on the study protocol. 
Provision of packs modified to refl ect experimental condition.  
• Schedule date and time for check -in calls (3 and 6 days after orientation) and [ADDRESS_1091504] 
with study participants.  Recruitment was done only through Facebook ads, and the eligibility 
survey integrated new questions on their availability for meeting in designated locations to 
receive study materials (i.e., study phone  and cigarette packs) and about their ability to 
participate in video calls (Skype or Zoom), and COVID -[ADDRESS_1091505] in participation were the same as during the pre -COVID period 
with the addition of  scheduling a study material pi[INVESTIGATOR_791714]. The social network questions were also moved to this call so the study phones 
could be programmed with named network members integrated into the data collection 
platform pri or to giving the participant the materials. The baseline survey and a COVID -19 
screener were also scheduled to be emailed to the participant on the morning of their materials 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_791715].  During this period, we stopped using CO levels for dete rmining 
eligibility due to concerns about COVID transmission. To meet sampling quotas, we prioritized 
recruitment of smokers who indicated they were male or intending to quit within six months.  
UofSC :  From August 12, [ADDRESS_1091506] on June 29, 2021.  
Cornell  University :  From December 1, 2020 to April 29, 2021, participants were recruited using 
the same protocols as for UofSC, including Facebook targeting of specific cities (i.e., 
Binghamton, Elmira, Syracuse, [COMPANY_002]ster, Utica, and Co rtland) and calling respondents to 
confirm eligibility and schedule meeting dates, times, and locations where they could pi[INVESTIGATOR_791716]. Additionally, participants at Cornell completed the orientation activities over 
Zoom prior to pi[INVESTIGATOR_791717] s tudy materials.   
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
All labeling stimuli associated with each of the four intervention groups are shown in Table 1.  
• The text -only  warnings  were stickers that covered the existing Surgeon General’s 
warning on the side of cigarette packs, covering approximately 50% of one side of packs.  
Four different text messages were selected from the [ADDRESS_1091507] FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products:  
o WARNING: Cigarettes cause fatal lung disease  
o WARNING: Cigarettes cause cancer  
o WARNING: Cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease  
o WARNING: Tobacco smoke can harm your children  
• The pi[INVESTIGATOR_791718] 2 ” x 1.75” stickers that covered approximately 50% of the 
bottom half of the front and back of cigarette pack s.  The text was the same as for the 
text-only warnings  but with accompanying imagery selected from the FDA’s originally 
proposed graphic war nings (2011) or for which prior research indicated effectiveness.  
• The four insert messages  were printed on 16 pt. matte cardstock and trimmed to 2 ” x 
3.5”. The four different messages selected based on our prior research to identify two 
effective messages to promote self -efficacy (i.e., tips to quit) (Loud et al., 2021) and two 
messages to promote response efficacy (i.e., cessation benefits) (Thrashe r et al., 2018).  
All four inserts were designed with contrasting color schemes to help increase the 
likelihood that participants would recognize that the inserts included multiple messages.  
All four inserts included the same cessation resource informatio n on the back. Reading 
levels ranged from 3.[ADDRESS_1091508] counts ranged from 25 -65 words.   
• Participants assigned to groups that did not receive inserts received no  inserts or 
accompanying control messages.   The control group received packs labeled with just the 
text-only warnings.

all participants were asked to report on the labeling of the cigarettes that they received.  
 
6 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
Participants could discontinue participation at any time.  Clinically relevant finding s were 
reported as an adverse event (AE) .  We discontinued participa tion for the following reasons : 
• Significant study intervention non-compliance , as indicated by [CONTACT_791739];   
• Unable to contact [CONTACT_791740];  
• Any event or medical condition or situation occur red such that continued collection of 
follow -up study data were not in  the best interest of the participant  or might have 
require d an additional treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study . 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study w ere recorded.  
Those  who sign ed the informed consent form and were randomized but d id not receive the study 
intervention were replaced.  Participants were also replaced if they signed the informed consent 
form , were randomized , receive d the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw,  or if they 
were discontinued from the study.  
A participant w as considered lost to follow -up if study personnel were unable to contact 
[CONTACT_73757] [ADDRESS_1091515] to follow -
up. 
 
7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Participant d ata were collected in three phases:  the baseline survey , which included 
measurement of potential moderators of intervention effects (H5 & H6); ecological momentary 
assessment s across the 2 -week study period, including data collected around smoking sessions 
and through daily evening surveys; the final followup survey.  Specifics on each of these are 
provided below.  
Baseline survey : 
Participants with confirmed eligibility who consented t o participate answer ed a baseline 
survey on sociodemographics (i.e., sex, education, income), a 1-minute validated task to assess 
 
17 
 delay discounting,45 46 a health literacy  assessment ,114 and smoking -related perceptions and 
behavior (e. g., time to first cigarette; preferred brand; risk perceptions; quit intentions; 
readiness to quit; self -efficacy to quit) using validated questions .115-[ADDRESS_1091516] their experimental condition . 
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) protocol:  
EMA data were collected from participants over 14 days  using a study smartphone 
(Android, Samsung Galaxy J3 and Samsung Galaxy A10e) for which all functions were disabled 
except for the app used for entering data. Participants were asked to use the app to log every 
cigarette they smoked during this period. Ap proximately 4 -5 times a day, participants were 
prompted to complete a brief, 1 -3 minute survey immediately after they indicated that they 
had smoked, with cigarette logs sampled using an algorithm based on self -reported baseline 
smoking frequency to reduce  participant burden.   Each day, between 7 and midnight, an 
evening survey was available in the smartphone app, which took 1 -3 minutes to complete. 
Participants received an alert on the study phone to complete this report at 9pm if they had not 
already com pleted it by [CONTACT_14713]. The app was programmed by [CONTACT_791741]’s team at HBART  
and uploaded to the cloud in real time, which allowed for monitoring  of participant compliance.   
Follow -up survey and study debrief:  
The conclusion of the study included a self -administered survey and study debrief, both 
which were scheduled for 15 days after the orientation. The survey took approximately 15 
minutes and assessed: s moking behaviors and beliefs measured at baseline ; react ance to health 
warning labels ; reactions to the inserts and labels on their packs, depending on their condition .  
After completing the survey, participants completed a 30 -minute debrief, which included:   
Aided and unaided recall of warnings and inserts to which participants were exposed;  
discussion of study protocol issues and suggestions to improve them in the future.    
The l ocation and timing of the followup survey  and debrief were different between 
UofSC and Cornell University both before and after COVID -19, desc ribed as follows : 
Pre-COVID U ofSC: Participants received a text reminder the morning of their scheduled follow -
up. Participants arrived at the U ofSC campus and first completed the survey in a private room. 
Then, participants completed the debrief with a U ofSC staff member. For the recall component 
of the debrief, participants viewed the stimuli on a computer screen. At the end, participants 
turned in their phone and charger and received their $[ADDRESS_1091517] in person.  
Pre-COVID Cornell  University : Participants completed the follow up remotely with an online 
survey and debrief phone call. They received a text reminder and an email with the survey link 
the morning of their scheduled follow up. They were instructed to complete the survey on their 
own before their debrief call. Once they were on the phone, the staff member conducting the 
interview sent the participant an email with a link to an online  presentation of the study stimuli 
for the recall component of the debrief and instructed to advance through the presentation 
 
18 
 only when instructed during the call. If participants had not yet completed the follow -up 
survey, they were instructed to complete  the survey and were called again once it was 
completed. At the end, participants were instructed to mail their phone and charger in the pre -
addressed and stamped envelopes they had received during orientation. Once the phone and 
charger were received, the ir $[ADDRESS_1091518] -COVID  onset U ofSC: Participants received a text reminder and email with the survey link 
the morning of their scheduled follow up. They were instructed to complete the survey on their 
own before their debrief meeting. Prior to the debrief meeting, the staff member conducting  
the interview sent the participant a Zoom link. The debrief occurred via Zoom with audio and 
video sharing when possible. For the recall component of the debrief, the staff member shared 
their screen and showed the participants the stimuli. Columbia parti cipants returned to the USC 
campus to return their cell phone and charger and receive their $[ADDRESS_1091519]. Greenville 
and Charlotte participants received a prepaid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_791720]. Once the phone and charger were rec eived, their $[ADDRESS_1091520] -COVID -onset Cornell  University : After the onset of COVID -19, the debrief occurred via 
Zoom with audio and video sharing when possible. For the recall component of the debrief, the 
staff member shared their screen and showed the participants the stimuli. If screen sharing was 
not possible , participants were sent the link and instructions for the online presentation of 
stimuli as was done during the pre -COVID period. All other aspects of the follow up protocol 
were the same as during the pre -COVID period.   
 
7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVER SE EVENTS  
 
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol use d the definition of a dverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): any untoward 
medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not 
considered intervention -related . 
Study participation involved receipt of information about the harms of smoking and the 
benefits of smoking cessation via c igarette package labeling.  All participants were adult s who 
smoked frequently, with their smoking status confirmed using standard protocols (COVITA 
>=8ppm).  Study personnel monitored protocol adherence in real time, and followed up with 
participants, as necessary, over the 2-week study period to trouble shoot and resolve any issues 
related to adherence.  This allowed identification of events that could be characterized as 
adverse events .  However, we did not consider these  events to be  intervention -relate d given  
that the intervention consisted of the provision of information  over a brief, [ADDRESS_1091521] 
 
19 
 some adverse events over the period of observation that would be p otentially related to their 
history of smoking , though not to study participation , per se .   
The following guidelines w ere used to describe severity  of events:   
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and  do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a partici pant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.

8.1 REGULATORY, ETHICA L, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
The UofSC IRB considered the study to be Expedited given that r esearch activities were 
determined to (i) present no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (ii) involve only 
procedures listed in one or more of the categories authorized by [ADDRESS_1091522] -protected computers and associated with a unique identifying number, 
without any personal information attached.  In one file, participants' names were associated 
with this unique identification number. We kep t this information in a locked office and on 
password protected network storage for three months after study participation has ended, in 
 
20 
 case we ha d any further questions around the data a particular participant provided. After that  
period lapsed , we destroy ed this file with personal information  for all participants who 
indicated that they were uninterested in being contact[CONTACT_791742] .

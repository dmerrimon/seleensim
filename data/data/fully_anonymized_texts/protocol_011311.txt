2   Partners Human Research Committee Detailed Protocol  Sarah Lassey, MD Sarah Little, MD (principal investigator)  Study Title: Length of foley catheter placement and induction of labor: a randomized controlled trial  Version date 2/21/18  Background and Significance  Induction of labor occurs in 24% of pregnancies in the [LOCATION_002] (Hamilton). There are many maternal and fetal indications for induction of labor at various gestational ages of pregnancy. Induction of labor consists of initial cervical ripening followed by [CONTACT_300854]. Cervical ripening helps the cervix soften, thin and dilate. There are multiple agents for cervical ripening including pharmacologic and mechanical dilation. Phamacologic agents include prostaglandins and oxytocin. Mechanical ripening most commonly refer to a foley catheter balloon device. Mechanical methods have been associated with lower rates of cesarean section compared with oxytocin alone (Boulvain). Previous studies have compared foley catheter placement for 12 vs. 24 hours and showed 12 hours decreases time to delivery (Cromi). Recently, studies have looked at the efficacy of dual induction agents with combination of oxytocin and foley catheter with time to delivery (Levine).   The cook catheter device, a type of foley catheter used for mechanical dilation, is a silicone double balloon catheter that can be inflated to 80mL/balloon. Per device guidelines it should not be left in place for more than [ADDRESS_367262] Selection  Our study population will include women 18-50 years of age at term (37-41 6/7 weeks) with a singleton gestation in cephalic presentation who are undergoing induction of labor. Both nulliparous and multiparous women will be included.  Women will need to have a bishop score <6 or cervical dilation  <2cm with intact membranes to be included, as these are the women currently being offered cervical ripening prior to labor induction. Women will be excluded if there is a contraindication to vaginal delivery. Women with history of a prior cesarean section will be excluded given their management may differ after removal of the foley catheter. Non-English speaking women will also be excluded given the length of time for induction on labor and delivery and inability to guarantee 24 hour interpreter services.  Women will be recruited from the Maternal Fetal Medicine and general Obstetrics clinics at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. They will be counseled in the office by [CONTACT_300855], based on their cervical examination.   Subject Enrollment  Women will be enrolled from clinic prior to induction of labor based on their cervical exam and need for cervical ripening. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], inductions are scheduled in clinic within the week prior. When a patient is being scheduled for an induction, and it is deemed that they will need cervical ripening, they are potential candidates for this trial. The process of informed consent will happen in the clinic if the patient desires to participate in the study. The study staff and other selected physicians in clinic who have agreed to help with the study will consent the patient. Once consent is obtained, the subjects will then be randomized to either [ADDRESS_367263] visualization with a speculum, as per provider preference as both methods are commonly used. The uterine component of the balloon will be inflated to maximum 60mL. The catheter will be taped to the inner thigh with gentle traction.  Below is an image of cook catheter with both uterine and vaginal balloons inflated. In this study we will only inflate the uterine balloon (the distal balloon), following current standard practice on our labor and delivery unit.  
4    In both groups participants will be started on a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based oxytocin protocol. This protocol begins with 2 milliunits/min of oxytocin, increasing by [ADDRESS_367264] practice and health care providers many perform amniotomy at any point during the induction process with a recommendation for amniotomy when cervix more than 4cm dilated, consistent with literature demonstrating a shorter time to delivery with earlier amniotomy (Battarbee). Labor interventions are at the discretion of the healthcare provider. The participants will have continuous fetal monitoring throughout their induction, labor and delivery. The need for operative delivery or cesarean section will be at the discretion of the healthcare provider.   Biostatistical Analysis  The main outcome will be length of time to delivery. A subject’s participation will end with outcomes 4 weeks following delivery.   Secondary maternal outcomes will be measured including cesarean delivery rate, time to active labor (>5cm dilated), delivery within 12 hours, delivery within 24 hours, maternal length of stay, and indication for cesarean delivery. We will also calculate a composite maternal morbidity outcome including estimated blood loss, higher-order laceration, blood transfusion, endometritis, wound infection, venous thromboembolism, hysterectomy, ICU admission or death. These outcomes will also be stratified by [CONTACT_147681]. We will also evaluate rates of analgesia in both groups.   A composite neonatal morbidity will be calculated including culture-proven neonatal sepsis, neonatal blood transfusion, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or 4, or therapeutic hypothermia. We will also analyze NICU admission, NICU admission for greater than 48 hours, and neonatal length of stay.   In the literature, the mean time to delivery with an induction of labor in 18 hours. A four hour reduction in time to delivery is considered clinically meaningful and has been used in prior studies evaluating induction of labor (Levine). A Type I α error of 0.05 

5  was selected. Assuming 80% power and a two-sided P value we would need 71 participants in each group for total sample size 142. However, given that some patients will undergo cesarean section during their induction of labor, we will exclude cesarean section in a sensitivity analysis. Assuming that 20% of patients will have a cesarean section, we will include [ADDRESS_367265] to current practices on labor and delivery.   Because the foley catheter is routinely used for cervical ripening during labor induction on labor and delivery we think that there is minimal increased risk from the study. However, by [CONTACT_300856] 6 hours, the length of time of cervical ripening is limited. Upon removal of the catheter at 6 hours the cervix may not be ripened and therefore increase the risk of prolonged induction and ultimately cesarean section.  If the intervention group is associated with longer length of time to delivery it may also be associated with increased blood loss and risk of infection, which are known risks of prolonged induction. Our study, however, allows physicians to manage labor as deemed appropriate after foley removal. Thus, if cervical ripening is felt to be inadequate, alternative cervical ripening agents (such as misoprostol) could still be used in appropriate candidates. Moreover, we feel it is most likely that the 12-hour foley group (the current standard of care) will have longer labor inductions, not the 6-hour experimental group, consistent with prior studies showing that labors were longer with 24 hour foley placement rather than 12 hour placement (Cromi). Also, our clinical experience is that when foley balloons are actively managed (i.e. the patient is checked vaginally sooner than 12 hours and tension is applied to see if the foley is ready to come out) most women achieve adequate cervical dilation much sooner than the maximum of [ADDRESS_367266] effective method of inducing labor remains unknown.  Monitoring and Quality Assurance  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_300853]. We will not perform any interim analysis, as we feel there is minimal risk from the study protocol and would not stop the study early. When adverse events 
6  occur they will be reported to the Partners’ IRB within 5 days with a detailed description of the event as described in the guidelines for adverse events reporting. Serious adverse events (severe hemorrhage, maternal death, neonatal death, neonatal hypoxemic encephalopathy) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_300857].

Why is this research study being done?
This research study will compare the impact of dietary restriction pre-operatively compared to the 
standard nutrition that a patient typi[INVESTIGATOR_880816]. We want to study how dietary restriction before surgery affects patient’s response to 
surgery and recovery studies suggest that short-term dietary restriction may be beneficial before 
surgery. This study is a randomized, controlled mechanistic study physician at Brigham and 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH). This research has no external funding and is supported by [CONTACT_880826].

randomized to the restricted diet.  
We will assign you by [CONTACT_3364] (like a coin toss) to the restricted diet group (called PCR), 
Group 1, or the control group, Group 2.  The control group will be eating what they would 
normally and not changing their diet. You and the study doctor cannot choose your study group.  
You will have a [ADDRESS_1231062] a 2 in

Group 1: The restricted diet group will drink ScandiShake mixed with almond 
milk
Group 2: Eats a normal, routine diet. You are encouraged to not change the way 
you eat.
Water intake is not restricted for either group, and participants should drink water as they 
normally do, and according to the pre-operative instructions given. Both diets can be consumed 
throughout the day and night.
If you do quality for the study, you will be asked to return to the Clinical Trials Hub 
(CTH) at BWH between [ADDRESS_1231063] meals. 
The following are details related to each visit:
Visit 1: Baseline Assessments (Pre-operative Day 30-5)
Collect information about your medical history, current health, and medications you are 
taking. We will also look at your medical record to help collect this information. To make 
sure this study is safe for you, you should be completely truthful with the study staff 
about your medical history.
Physical exam, including height and weight.
Blood Draw. This will be used for standard lab tests and measure production of stress and 
inflammation markers. We will draw about 35mL of blood (about 2.5 tablespoons).
If you are female who is of children bearing potential, blood will be drawn and tested to 
ensure you are not pregnant. If you are pregnant, you cannot take part in this study.

Visit2: Day of Surgery
The day of surgery will ask you to provide a repeat blood draw for research purposes, which will 
be done at the same time as blood draws needed for your care. During the surgery, a small tissue 
sample will be collected by [CONTACT_880831], about the size of an eraser head. From this 
point on, you may resume your usual diet according to standard post-operative care, regardless of 
what diet you were assigned to. We will still ask you to continue logging your diet using either 
MealLogger or paper record.  
At this visit, we will collect/perform:
Blood sample
Weight
Food diary (if applicable) 
Fat tissue samples will be taken and analyzed.  These samples will each be about the size 
of the eraser head of a pencil.
Discarded tissue that might be left over after your surgery will also be collected for 
analysis. 
Visit 3: Post-Operation Day [ADDRESS_1231065]-operation day 1 for the following 
procedures. Both groups (PCR diet and normal diet) will resume normal diet immediately after 
surgery according to recommendation by [CONTACT_6098]. For subjects who do not need an

Future Use of Stored Specimens
The small amount of blood at Visits 1-3 will be labeled with a code number (not your name) and 
temporarily stored and analyzed for chemical composition in a vascular research laboratory at 
BWH. Samples will also be stored and analyzed in The Mitchell Laboratory (Harvard School of 
Public Health) and by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Karen Ho (Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine). Fat samples 
will be studied at BWH for chemical composition and microscopic examination. These will be

Possible Hunger 
If you are assigned to the restricted diet you may experience hunger or discomfort. If you feel too 
hungry or uncomfortable you may choose to resume a normal diet while recording all intake and 
stay in the study. You may also withdraw at any time.
Possible Fatigue
You may also experience fatigue pre-operatively if randomized to the restricted diet. 
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?
You may or may not benefit medically from taking part in this study. We hope that if you receive 
the restricted diet you may have less chance of complications after your surgery, but this is 
unproven. We do not expect any benefit if you are randomized to the non-dietary restricted arm.
Choosing to take part in this research study may help others having surgery in the future. It is 
important to know that you may not receive any direct benefit from participating.  
What other treatments or procedures are available for my condition?

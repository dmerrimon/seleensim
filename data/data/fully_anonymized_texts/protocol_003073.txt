I. At the Sponsor request, exploratory analysis will be 
performed on leftover pharmacokinetic plasma samples. Hence the following sentence was added to Section 5 Synopsis under Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection and Section 11.2.1 Blood Sampling and Processing : 
“Additional analysis for exploratory purposes, including but 
not limited to factor XIa  activity , will be performed on 
leftover plasma samples at the Sponsor’s discretion.”  
II. In addition, the serum chemistry tests scheduled [ADDRESS_366421] as 
subjects will receive their lunch approximately 4 hours before. Therefore the following sections were updated (added 
wording in bold ): 
1. Section 6 Study Event Flow Chart (footnote h) : 
“Samples for serum chemistry will be obtained following 
a fast of at least 8  hours (except for the 8 -hour time 
point) , however, in case of dropouts or rechecks, subjects 
may not have fasted for 8  hours before the serum 
chemistry sample is taken.”  
2. The first sentence in the last paragraph of Section [IP_ADDRESS] Meal Schedule:  
“Subjects will be required to fast for at least 8 hours 
before the clinical laboratory tests at screening and before the clinical laboratory tests at other scheduled times 
(except for the 8 -hour time point) .” 
3. Section 11.1.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests (footnote *):  
“Serum chemistry tests will be performed after at least an 
8-hour fast  (except for the 8 -hour time point) ; however, 
in case of dropouts or reche cks, subjects may not have 
fasted for 8  hours before the serum chemistry sample is 
taken ” 
III. Severity grading scales to be use d for adverse event s (AEs) 
reporting  will be based on detailed  toxicity scales provided 
in the FDA Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale 
for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in 
Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials
. Hence the table listing 
the general definition for rating severity of the AE

1. At the Sponsor request a PT/INR sample was added on Day [ADDRESS_366423] this addition:  
• Section 6 Study Event Flow Chart was updated to add an “X” on Day 4 for Coagulation (PT/INR)  row. 
• To prevent confusion, the footnote “i” was removed from all the “X” between Day 2 and Day 29 in the Coagulation (PT/INR)  row and added to “ Coag ulation (PT/INR) ” in the 
Study Procedures column.  
• Table 2 was updated. The number of samples was updated to “at least 5” under Number of Time Points column and On-study coagulation (PT/INR only)  row. 
2. Celerion recently moved from the standard 4.5mL tube for coagulation to a new 3.5mL tube . Therefore Table [ADDRESS_366424] that change. The total blood volume has decreased from 318.5 mL to 300.5 mL. 
3. Formating changes were made throughout the protocol.

             02May 2017  1. All subjects, regardless of their aPTT results, will be monitored 
until Day 29. Therefore, if aPTT value reach es ±10% of the 
baseline value or within the normal range by [CONTACT_2006] 29, the 
subject  will return to the clinical research unit (CRU) for the FU 
visit on Day  36. If aPTT value does  not reach  ± 10% of the 
baseline value or within the normal range by [CONTACT_2006] 29, sampling 
will continue every 7 days (±  2 days) until the ±  10% of 
baseline value or the normal range is  reached . Subjects  will 
return for the FU visit (i.e., follow -up procedures and AE 
evaluation) 7 days (± 2 days) after aPTT value reaches ±10% of 
the baseline value or within the normal range . The protocol was 
updated throughout to refle ct this change.  
2. The dosing interval between the sentinel group and the 
remaining subjects was revised to at least [ADDRESS_366426] this 
change.  
3. Section [IP_ADDRESS] was  revised to clarify that the designated times 
for aPTT assessments are listed in the study events flow chart.  
4. Subjects with normal renal and liver function, and norma l 
coagulation parameters will be enrolled in this study . Therefore 
the following inclusion criteria were added to Section 10.3.[ADDRESS_366427] s for normal limits of the listed laboratory tests: 
• Aspart ate aminotransferase (AST) , alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) , alkaline phosphatase (ALP) , lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) , blood urea nitrogen (BUN) , creatinine must be 
between the lower limit of normal (LLN; or up to 15% below LLN
 as not indicative of hepatic or renal disease in 
healthy subjects ) and the upper limit of normal , inclusive, as 
indicated in Appendix 1 at screening and check- in. 
• aPTT, PT/INR, and platelets, must be within the limits of 
normal , inclusive, as indicated in Appendix 1 at screeni ng 
and check -in. 
• Bleeding time must be between 2 to 8 minutes, inclusive, at 
check -in. 
5. Up to 28 days of safety data will be used and review ed for dose 
escalation decision instead of 7 days. As well, Section [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_300190] 3G3

dosing cohort. The second paragraph of Section [IP_ADDRESS] Dose 
Escalation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_300191] s (delet ed 
text presented in strike through; added text presented in bold):  
“The SRC will review all pertinent blinded safety/tolerability 
data (e.g., physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and AEs) using all available data collected  
from all subjects dosed  to at least Day [ADDRESS_366430] complete scheduled safety procedures up to Day 29 prior to the decision to open proceed to  the next higher dosing 
cohort”  
6. All SAEs, regardless of presumed relatedness to study drug, will be considered for dose escalation decisions, except those that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes. Therefore rules #3a in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_300191] s (deleted text  presented 
in stri kethrough; added text presented in bold) : 
“At least [ADDRESS_366431] has a SAE or visit to the emergency room 
deemed to be study drug related  regardless of relatedness to 
the study drug, except SAEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes .”
 
In addition, the following changes were made:  
7. Clinical laboratory tests were added 8 hour after dosing. Section  6 Study Event Flow Chart and Table 2 (in Section 11.4 
Blood Volume for Study Assessments) were updated accordingly.  
8. Section 8.4.2 Dose Selection was updated to add the following information  (deleted text presented in strikethrough; added text 
presented in bold) :  
“(…)
 Using  the regulatory guidance for estimating a safe 
starting dose in humans, the maximum recommended starting dose ( MRSD) based on the NOAEL from the toxicology studies 
with a default safety  correction  factor of 10 applied was 
determined to be 5 mg/kg. The PAD determined by [CONTACT_11339]-GLP in vivo efficacy studies in baboons was 1 mg/kg and is,

CA19214 (3G3 -15-01)_Amend 3 Final Protocol_06Nov2017 5. SYNOPSIS  
Compound xisomab 3G3 (anti -FXI monoclonal antibody, IgG4)  
Active Ingredient: xisomab 3G3 ( ∼15 mg/mL)  
Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: 8% sucrose, 10 mM histidine, 30 mM arginine HCl, 
10 mM methionine, 80 ppm polysorbate 80  
Clinical Indication  Prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and 
thromboembolism  
Study Phase and Type  Phase 1, s ingle ascending dose (SAD) , first -in-human study  
Study Objectives  The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and 
tolerability of single  intravenous (IV)  doses of xisomab 3G3 when 
administered to healthy adult subjects.  
The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:  
1. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single  IV doses of 
xisomab 3G3 when administered to healthy adult subjects . 
2. To assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of single  IV doses of 
xisomab 3G3 when administered to healthy adult subjects . The  
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will be used as a surrogate PD marker . 
Study Design  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, SAD study 
conducted at one stud y center in the [LOCATION_002]  (US). 
Four  (4) cohorts of either 6 subjects (Cohort 1 [4 active and 
2 placebo ]) or 5 subjects (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 [4 active and 
1 placebo]) are planned for evaluation. In each cohort, subjects will 
receive a single IV infusion of xisomab 3G3 or placebo. Subjects 
will participate in only one cohort.  
Safety (e.g., physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs ), clinical laboratory tests,  injection site reaction, 
immunogenicity, and adverse events [AEs]) will be assessed 
throughout the study; serial blood samples and urine samples will be collected for these assessments.  
Blood samples will also be collected for the PK ( free xisomab 3G3)  
and PD (aPTT) assessment s of xisomab 3G3 at scheduled  time point s 
as listed in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section 6 ) for at least 
[ADDRESS_366456] No.: 3G3 -15-[ADDRESS_366457] No.: CA19214

CA19214 (3G3 -15-01)_Amend 3 Final Protocol_06Nov2017 (± 2 days) until aPTT  value s return within ±10% of the baseline 
value  or the  normal range .  
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) sample collection  will be performed on 
Days [ADDRESS_366458] 
Day 29, an additional ADA sample collection will occur at the 
follow -up (FU) visit. 
Dose escalation to the next dose level (i.e. , next cohort) will not take 
place until the Safet y Review Committee (SRC) has determined that 
adequate safety and tolerability of xisomab 3G3 from the current and 
previous cohort s has been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the 
next cohort .  
Interi m PK and PD analyses may be performed to reconsider the 
sampling time points  as the study progresses and to guide the 
dose-escalation decision .  
Subjects for whom aPTT value reaches ±10% of the baseline value or within the normal range  by [CONTACT_2006] 29, 
will return to the clinical 
research unit (CRU) for the FU visit on Day  [ADDRESS_366459] study visit.  
Subjects for whom aPTT did not reach ± 10% of the baseline value 
or within the normal range  on Day 29, will return every 7 days 
(±2 days)  until aPTT reach ±10% of the baseline value or within the 
normal range and for the FU v isit (i.e., follow -up procedures and AE 
evaluation) 7 days (±2 days) after it was reached.  If aPTT values 
remain elevated past Day 29, an additional ADA sample collection will occur at the FU visit.  
Subjects who terminate the study early will be asked to continue aPTT monitoring as scheduled 
in the Study Events Flow Chart 
(Section  6) until it reaches ±10% of the baseline value or within the 
normal range. They will return to the CRU approximately 7  days 
(±2 days)  after aPTT reaches ±10% of the baseline value or within 
normal range for the FU visit to perform scheduled follow -up 
procedures, and to determine if any AE has occurred since the last study visi t. They will also be asked to return on Days [ADDRESS_366460]

An attempt will be made to include at least 2 females per cohort.  
Two sentinel subjects will be dosed (one placebo, one active) in 
Cohort [ADDRESS_366464]

xisomab 3G3. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements. The subject population will be comprised of healthy adult male and/or female subjects.  
A brief overview of available information regarding xisomab 3G3 follows below. Details can be found in the xisomab 3G3 Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) . 
[ADDRESS_366482] (intrinsic) pathway of coagulation and is intended to address the problem of 
dose limiting bleeding side effects of current antithrombotic agents. Xisomab 3G3 was developed by [CONTACT_214078], Inc. and the current formulation is intended for IV administration. The proposed indications for xisomab 3G3 include prevention or treatment of thrombotic and thromboembolic diseases, such as venous thrombosis and thromboembolism. 
Aronora, Inc. has conducted a comprehensive nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
program in support of cl inical development of xisomab 3G3. Experimental evidence suggests 
that contact [CONTACT_300213], but it has no known role in normal hemostasis. Contact [CONTACT_300214] -activation of coagulation Factor 
XII (FXII ) on negatively charged surfaces . Activated FXII (FXIIa) then activates coagulation 
Factor XI (FXI), which then activates coagulation Factor IX (FIX) and ultimately leads to generation of the procoagulant enzyme thrombin from prothrombin. The therapeutic 
monoclonal antibody xisomab 3G3 binds the apple 2 domain of FXI  and therefore interferes 
with the activation of FXI by [CONTACT_300215]. Importantly, this interaction selectively prevents 
activation of FXI by [CONTACT_300216] s of FXIIa or 
the hemostatic feedback activation of FXI by [CONTACT_49690], or other mechanisms, nor does it interfere with the catalytic activity of activated FXI (FXIa)  on its hemostatic substrates. 
Because FXIIa does not contribute to the hemostasis of mammali an species, and activation of 
FXI by [CONTACT_300217] a pathologic al event that appears to promote thrombosis in experimental 
animals, inhibition of FXI activation by [CONTACT_300218] 3G3 is expected to be a safe 
and effective antithrombotic intervention in hum ans who are at risk or have developed 
thrombosis . 
The goal of xisomab 3G3 treatment is to achieve safe anticoagulation for several days with a 
single dose. A single dose of xisomab 3G3 demonstrated potent and sustained antithrombotic effects in both mice a nd nonhuman primate models, and showed no toxicity at and above 
saturating doses in nonclinical Good laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Saturation of binding to the molecular target and the maximum FXI inhibitory eff ect is achieved at a relatively low dose of xisomab 3G3 because FXI circulates 
at a low plasma concentration (3 to 10 mg/L), and the antibody has high affinity toward FXI. The effect of increasing the dose above the saturating level results in prolongation of 
xisomab 3G3

3-induced arterial thrombosis (Study  No. AB023.4), a mouse model of sepsis  
(Study  No. AB022.4) , and a well -established model of thrombosis in baboons (Study  
No. AB023.5). Importantly, while treatment with xisomab 3G3 or 14E11 attenuated 
thrombosis in these experimental models of thrombosis, no demonstrable effect on hemostasis was observed. These data suggest that in contrast to currently marketed antithrombotic s that target elements of the coagulation cascade important for both thrombosis 
and hemostasis, xisomab 3G3 is designed to selectively inhibit thrombosis without increasing risk of bleeding side effects.  
8.3.2 Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetics were eval uated in a non- GLP study in baboons (Papio Anubis) in which 
1 mg/kg of xisomab 3G3 was administered by [CONTACT_300221] 3G3 plasma concentration was measured over time. Non -compartmental analysis of the xisomab 3G3 
plasma concentration versus time curve revealed the maximal plasma concentrations normalized to dose (C
max/Dose) was 19.66 ± 0.56 L/kg, the area  under  the concentration time 
curve from time [ADDRESS_366485]- dose normalized to dose 
(AUC 0-xh/Dose) was 1594 ±  82 kg  x h/L, and the apparent volume of distribution (V d) was 
0.050 ± 0.0012 L/kg. Group mean terminal elimination half -lives ( T½) ranged from 45 to 
75 hours and the mean residence time (MRT) ranged from 88 to  110 hours in baboons after a 
1 mg/kg IV  injection.  
In addition, toxicokinetics were evaluated as part of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_300194]. In both studies, IV doses of 0, 2, 10, and 
50 mg/kg of xisomab 3G3 were administered by [CONTACT_300222]. All animals except 
controls showed systemic exposure to xisomab 3G3 following single IV dose. IV infusions of 
xisomab 3G3 in cynomolgus monkeys resulted in peak free xisomab 3G3 plasma 
concentrations at the first or second time point evaluated, approximately 0.[ADDRESS_366486] profiles. In the absence of the recovery data for the main study animals, the terminal  elimination phase could 
only be estimated with confidence for one male who received 10 mg/kg, with T
½, CL and V d 
of 31.9 hour s, 0.513 mL/h/kg, and 23.6 mL/kg, respectively. Inclusion of the recovery 
animals (n = 2/sex/group) for all dose levels allowed for better characterization of the terminal elimination phase, however, it could only be estimated for six out of twelve

hours . Individual CL and V d were estimated between 0.142 and 0.535 mL/h/kg and 34.0 and 
57.8 mL/kg, respectively . 
IV infusions of xisomab 3G3 in rats resulted in peak xisomab 3G3 plasma concentrations at 
the first or second  time point evaluated, approximately 0.5 - 3 hours  following 
administration . The terminal elimination phase was only characterized for the males and 
females at the 50 mg/kg dose level, as the terminal eliminatio n phase for the 2 and 10 mg/kg 
dose levels was not reported due to either a coefficient of determination less than 0.800 or the extrapolation of the AUC to infinity represented more than 20% of the total area. The T
½ for 
the males and females at the 50 mg/ kg dose level was 155 hours  and 185 h ours respectively. 
The average volume of distribution (V d) was 45.2 mL/kg and 45.3 mL/kg for the males 
respectively and the clearance (CL) was 0.202 and 0170 mL/h/kg for the males and females respectively.  
8.3.3 Toxicology 
The safety and toxicity profile of xisomab 3G3 was evaluated in two, GLP, single dose acute, toxicity studies in Sprague Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkey s. In both studies, a single 
dose of xisomab 3G3 was administered intravenously at doses of 0, 2, 10 a nd 50 mg/kg and 
animals were evaluated for 3 days (main group) and 28 days (recovery group) after dosing. Xisomab 3G3 was well tolerated in both species and no xisomab 3G3- related AEs  were 
observed. An expected aPTT  prolongation was observed in all groups dosed with xisomab 
3G3, and the duration of effect was dose dependent. In the cynomolgus monkey study, there 
was no difference in aPTT prolongation between males and females. The prolonged aPTT was first observed 30 minutes after dosing (the first time point evaluated) and persisted until 336 hours postdose (Day 15) at 2 mg/kg and 672 hours postdose (Day 29) at 10 and 50 mg/kg. Similarly, in the Sprague Dawley rats study, prolonged aPTT was first observed at [ADDRESS_366488] -dose (the first time point evalua ted) and was generally of similar magnitude 
across the dose groups and genders; the duration of the effect increased with increasing dose. The No  Observed Adverse Effect  Levels (NOAEL) for both studies was determined to be 50 
mg/kg. In addition to the toxi city studies, a GLP tissue cross reactivity study was performed 
in a panel of human tissue to assess potential cross -reactivity of xisomab 3G3. No xisomab 
3G3-related staining was observed in any of the human tissue samples (36 tissue types from 
3 normal healthy donors). Cytokine release assays performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 healthy donors revealed that xisomab 3G3, presented in three different stimulation formats, did not stimulate the release of interleukin (IL) -2, IL -4, 
IL-6, IL -10, tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma from PBMCs of any of the 
donors .

CA19214 (3G3 -15-01)_Amend [ADDRESS_366490] animal toxicology studies. Since this is the initial study in humans, the initial dose of xisomab 3G3 has been justified  
conservatively according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance document “Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers”.  
2  
The proposed clinical starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg was estimated based on the NOAEL determined by [CONTACT_300223], the pharmacologically active dose (PAD) from the non-
GLP in vivo efficacy studies in baboons, in vitro aPTT studies in pooled human plasma , and 
an understanding of the mechanism of action of xisomab 3G3 and its target, FXI. As recommended by [CONTACT_300224],  
2 scaling based on body weight rather than body surface area 
will be used because the NOAEL determined in both the rat and nonhuman primate GLP toxicity studies occur at the same mg/kg dose and xisomab 3G3 is a monoclonal antibody to be administered intravascularly whose molecular weight is greater than 100,000 Daltons. 
2 
On the basis of no adverse effects noted in the toxicity studies, the NOAEL was determined to be 50 mg/kg in both species. Using the regulatory guidance for estimating a safe starting dose in humans, the maximum recommended starting dose ( MRSD ) based on the NOAEL 
from the toxicology studies with a default safety factor of 10 applied was determined t o be 
5 mg/kg. T he PAD determined by [CONTACT_11339]- GLP in vivo efficacy studies in baboons was 1 
mg/kg and is, therefore, 5-fold lower than the MRSD based on the NOAEL. Dividing the 
PAD by a safety factor of 10 would provide a very conservative starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The selection of 0.1 mg/kg for the first in human starting dose is further supported when 
using the minimum  anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) to select a starting dose. 
Using in vitro aPTT data  from pooled human plasma  in which the EC
10 was calculated to be 
the equivalent of 0.11 mg/kg and knowledge of the xisomab 3G3 mechanism of action, the 
MABEL is estimated to be approximately 0.1  mg/kg. This dose is anticipated to produce a 
minimal biological effect in most human subjects.  
The expected maximum level of anticoagulation  is estimated to be achieved at or below a 
dose of 1 mg/ kg based on the effect of xisomab 3G3 or its murine precursor, xisomab 14E11, 
on the contact [CONTACT_300225]  (Study  No. AB023.1) and in several experimental 
animal models of thrombosis, including a mouse model of FeCl 3-induced arterial thrombosis

The doses will be escalated until a  dose of 5 mg /kg is reached , in order to provide a broad 
range of doses available for the subsequent studies patients with thrombotic di sease and 
maintain a safety margin of [ADDRESS_366492] -in-human dose escalation study will initiate single doses at 
0.1 mg/kg  and may escalate doses up to 5 mg/kg  depending on the safety and dose tolerance 
parameters observed at each dose level during the st udy. Dosing will not exceed 5 mg/kg 
without a protocol amendment. 
8.5 Risk/Benefit  
The safety monitoring practices employed by [CONTACT_3181] ( e.g., physical examina tion, vital 
signs, 12- lead ECG, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, injection site 
reaction  monitoring , and AE questioning) are adequate to protect the subjects’ safety and 
should detect all expected TEAEs . 
As there is a potential to develop an immune response to a biologic agent , immunogenicity 
will be assessed in this study.  
The approximate volume of blood planned for collection from each subject over the course of 
the study (see Section 11.4), presents no undue risk to the subjects nor does the possibility of collection (for wasting to ensure clean sample) of additional blood in the event an indwelling cannula is utilized and the possibility of a dditional blood for recheck of safety labs if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_1461] . 
There will be no direct health benefit for trial participants from receipt of study drug. An indirect health benefit to the healthy subjects enrolled in this trial is the  free medical tests 
received at screening and during the study.

10.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, SAD study conducted at one study 
center in the US.  
Four (4) cohorts of either 6 subjects (Cohort 1 [4 active and 2  placebo ]) or 5 subjects 
(Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 [4 active and 1 placebo]) are planned for evaluation. In each cohort, 
subjects will receive a single IV infusion of xisomab 3G3 or placebo. Subjects will participate in only one cohort. 
Safety (e. g., physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, injection site 
reaction, immunogenicity, and AEs) will be assessed throughout the study; serial blood 
samples and urine samples will be collected for these assessments.  
Blood samples will also be collected  for the PK ( free xisomab 3G3)  and PD (aPTT) 
assessments of xisomab 3G3 at scheduled time points as listed in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section 6 ) for at least 672 hours  postdose . Following the 672 -hour time point, sample 
collection for PK and PD assessments will continue  every 7 days (±  2 days) until aPTT  
value s return within ±10% of the baseline value  or the normal range .  
ADA sample collection  will be performed on Days [ADDRESS_366495] Day 29, an additional ADA sample collection will occur at the FU visit.  
Dose escalation to the next dose level (i.e., next cohort) will not take place until the SRC has determined that adequate safety and tolerability of xisomab 3G3 from the current and 
previous cohorts has been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort.  
Interim PK and PD analyses may be performed to reconsider the sampling time points as the 
study progresses and to guide the dose -escalation decision.  
See the planned dose escalations in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
10.1.1 Confinement, Return Visits, and Follow -Up 
Subjects will be housed on Day - 1, at the time indicated by [CONTACT_300226], until after the 24- hour 
blood draw and/or study procedures. Subjects will only be discharged if the prothrombin time 
(PT)/international normalized ratio  (INR) values are ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_366496] 2 days after 
discharge to confi rm the PT/INR values.  
Subjects will return for study procedures as indicated in the Study Events Flow Chart (Section  6). At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
Subjects for whom aPTT value reaches ±10% of the baseline value or within the normal range by [CONTACT_2006] 29, will return to the CRU for the FU visit on Day  [ADDRESS_366497] No.: 3G3 -15-[ADDRESS_366498] No.: CA19214

CA19214 (3G3 -15-01)_Amend 3 Final Protocol_06Nov2017 [IP_ADDRESS] Maintenance of Randomizat ion 
A computerized randomization scheme will be created by a Celerion statistician and shall be 
considered blinded as per the following: the randomization is available only to the clinic pharmacy staff that is preparing the drug and is not involved in any other aspect of the study including administration of the drug. It will not be made available to the Sponsor, subjects, or members of the staff responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of safety assessments. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Breaking the Blind Prior to Study Completion  
One set of sealed envelopes containing the randomization code will be supplied to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_214064].  
Breaking of the blind is expressly forbidden except in the event of a medical emergency where the identity of the drug must be known in order to properly treat the subject , or in the 
event of a  safety interim analysis  at the request of the sponsor (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .  
In the event of a medical emergency, it is requested that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_300203]. If breaking the blind is required because of a medical emergency, the treatment identity would be revealed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], for that subject only. In the event that the emergency is one, in which it appears that the other subjects may be at imminent risk, the blind may be broken for all subjects dosed at that dose level. The unblinding will be properly documented in the study file.  
In all cases where the code is broken, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_300204].  
At the end of the study, envelopes will be retained or destroyed according to site procedures unless specified otherwise by [CONTACT_1034]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Analysis  
Safety : 
All available blinded safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_186498].  
At the Sponsor’s request, unblinded safety tables, figures, and data listings may be presented 
to the sponsor’s m edical expert and head of regulatory for the purposes of planning the next 
initial Phase [ADDRESS_366534] No.: 3G3 -15-[ADDRESS_366535] No.: CA19214

progresses and to guide the dose escalation decision. In such a case, interim PK analysis will 
not use the actual subject numbers in order to avoid breaking the blind.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Preliminary PD analysis may be performed to evaluate the sampling time points as the study progresses and to guide the dose escalation decision. In suc h a case, interim PD analysis will 
not use the actual subject numbers in order to avoid breaking the blind.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Revealing of Randomization  
In the absence of a medical emergency, the blinded randomization for this study will not be revealed until all data are entered in the database, edits checks are performed, queries closed, case report forms ( CRFs) signed by [CONTACT_978], and the database is officially locked.  
10.4.5 Treatment Compliance  
Drug administration will be performed by a qualified designee (e.g., nurse). Before and after IV infusion, the qualified designee will visually inspect the syringe to ensure that the subject 
has received the entire dose. In the case of an incomplete dosing  (e.g., large droplet of study 
medication on the surface of the skin) as deemed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Sponsor, the subject may be withdrawn.

performed at each visit. Individual clinical procedures are described in detail below. 
Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_50286]/or the Sponsor for reasons related to subject safety.  
For this study, the primary assessment is the safety and tolerability. Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_63287], vital signs, ECGs, clinical labo ratory parameters, 
including but not limited to, hematology, serum chemistry profile, coagulation, urinalysis, injection site reaction, immunogenicity, and AEs as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart (Section 6 ).  
Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take 
precedence over all routine scheduled procedures.  
11.1.1 Body Height and Weight  
Body height (centimeters) and body weight (kilograms) will be measured as outlined in the Study Event s Flow Chart ( Section 6 ). BMI will be calculated  at screening . 
11.1.2 Physical Examination  
Full and abbreviated  physical examination s will be performed as per Study Events Flow 
Chart ( Section  6).  
Full physical examinations  will include, at a minimum, assessment of the following systems: 
skin, head, ears, eyes, nose and throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, neurological condition, blood and lymphatic systems, and the musculoskeletal system.  
Abbreviated physical examinations will include at the minimum, examination of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems, with the option for further examination of additional systems as necessary based on reported symptoms/AEs. 
Symptom -driven physical examination  may be performed at other times, if deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
Medical history will be recorded at screening.  
11.1.3 Vital Signs  
Single measurements of body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and heart rate 
will be measured as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section 6).
 Additional vital 
signs may be taken at any other times,  if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461] . 
Vital sign  measurements will be performed with subjects in a seated position, except when

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Definition  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.  
A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relations hip between the drug and the AE.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
 [ADDRESS_366545] of xisomab 3G3 and will, therefore, not be consi dered an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored throughout confinement for adverse reactions to the study drug and/or procedures. Subjects will be asked how they are feeling once per day during confinement and at each return/ follow -up visit.  
AEs (whether serious or non- serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test 
value(s) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_50286] t reated and/or followed up until the 
symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_1461] . 
Treatment of SAEs will be performed by a licensed medical provider , either at Celerion or at 
a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_9487]. Where appropriate, medical test(s) and/or examination(s) will be performed to document resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown (lost to follow up). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  
All AEs that occurred during  this clinical trial will be recorded. AEs  will be coded using the 
most current MedDRA
® available at Celerion.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_300205] 
(likely, probably, possibly, unlikely or unrelated ). Each sign or symptom reported will be 
graded on the FDA ( Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ) toxicity grading scale for 
healthy volunteers 4- point severity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4) .[ADDRESS_366546] No.: 3G3 -15-[ADDRESS_366547] No.: CA19214

Page 47  
CA19214 (3G3 -15-01)_Amend 3 Final Protocol_06Nov2017 Relationship of AE:  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following 
definitions:  
Unrelated  § The adverse event must clearly be caused by [CONTACT_300233], or the study procedure/conditions  
§ Definitely not related to drug 
§ Temporal sequence of an adverse event onset relative to administration of drug not reasonable  
§ Another obvious cause of  an adverse event  
Unlikely  § Time sequence is unreasonable  
§ There is another more likely cause for an adverse event  
Possibl y § Corresponds to what is known about the drug 
§ Time sequence is reasonable  
§ Could have been due to another equally, likely cause  
Probabl y § Is a known effect of the drug 
§ Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable  
§ Ceases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478] 
§ Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_300234]  § Is a known effect of the drug (e.g. listed in IB)  
§ Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable  
§ Event stops upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21395], event returns upon restarting drug 
Note: Prolonged aPTT is an expected pharmacological effect of xisomab 3G3 and will, therefore, not be considered an AE.  
Severity of AE:  
Severity rating used during the study will be based on the the toxicity grading scale tables present in the FDA (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) toxicity grading scale for healthy volunteers 4- point severity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4).
3 
The following definitions for rating severity will be used  for AEs not identified in the 
guidance:  
Mild (Grade 1)  The AE does not interfere with daily activity  
Moderate (Grade 2)  The AE interferes with daily activity, but no medical 
intervention is required

events are deemed drug -related. All serious event reporting will a dhere to 21 CFR  312.32 for 
Investigational New Drugs (IND) and to the Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE, dated December 2012. 
4 The IRB will be 
notified of the Alert Reports as per FDA regulations.  
A SAE is any AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the PI (or designee ) 
or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes:  Death, a life- threatening adverse event, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anom aly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening is defined as an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of the PI 
(or designee)  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
Unexpected is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.

the study early will also be asked to return every 7  days (±  2 days) for aPTT monitoring until aPTT value s return 
within ±  10% of baseline value or the normal range . 
†† Sample for immunogenicity will be taken from the PK sample tube. If this sample does not correspond with a  PK 
sample , an extra 10 mL of blood sample will be collected . 
††† If additional safety, PK, or PD analysis is necessary or if larger collection tubes are required to obtain sufficient 
plasma/serum for analysis, additional blood may be obtained (up to a maximum of ~ 500 mL; this volume could be 
exceeded only with  agreement of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a case-by -case basis ).

12.1 Statistical Analysis  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be prepared by [CONTACT_214104]. This document may modify the plans  outlined in 
the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoints definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. Additional statistical analyses other than those described in this section may be performed if deemed appropriate and included in the SAP .  
12.1.1 Sample Size Calculation  
The sample size chosen for this study was selected without statistical considerations. It has been determined adequate to meet the study objectives.  Cohorts of up to 6 (4:2 ratio of ac tive 
study drug:placebo) and 5 subjects ( 4:1 ratio of active study drug:placebo) are sufficient to 
characterize the single- dose safety, tolerability , PK, and PD  profile.  
12.1.2 Subjects to Analyze  
Safety  population:  All subjects who received the study drug  (acti ve or placebo) will be 
included in the safety summary.  
PK population:  All subjects receiving the active drug and having any measurable plasma 
concentration of study drug  will be included in the PK data set . All subjects who comply 
sufficiently with the protocol and display an evaluable PK profile (e.g., exposure to treatment, availability of measurements and absence of major protocol violations) will be included in the statistical analyses.  
PD population:  All subjects receiving the study drug  (active or placebo) and having any 
measurable PD data will be included in the PD data set.  
12.1.3 Safety Analysis  
The following analyses  will be performed; however no formal inferential statistics will be 
done on safety assessments . 
The placebo subjects from all cohorts will be pooled into a single placebo group for all summaries and presentations. 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data and frequency counts will

AUMC 0-inf:* Area under the moment curve from time [ADDRESS_366561] measurable 
concentration, = AUMC 0-t + [(tlast x Ct)/ K el]+ Ct/( Kel)2 
Cmax: Maximum observed concentration.  
Tmax: Time to reach C max. If the maximum value occurs at more than one 
time point, T max is defined as the first time point with this value.  
Kel: Apparent first -order terminal elimination rate constant calculated 
from a semi -log plot of the plasma concentration versus time 
curve. The parameter will be calculated by [CONTACT_47390] -squares 
regression analysis using the maximum number of points in the 
terminal log -linear phase (e.g., three or more non -zero plasma 
concentrations). 
T½: Apparent first -order terminal elimination half -life will be 
calculated as 0.693/  Kel. 
CL: Apparent total plasma clearance calculated as [Dose/AUC 0-inf]. 
MRT: * Mean residence time = AUMC 0-inf/AUC 0-inf (for IV infusion)  
Vss: Total apparent volume of distribution following single IV dose 
administration ca lculated as V ss = MRT  x CL. 
* AUMC 0-inf and MRT values will be used for V ss calculation but will not be listed in 
the PK tables.  
Additional PK parameters may be computed if deemed appropriat e. 
No PK parameters will be calculated for subjects with 2 or fewer consecutive time points 
with detectable concentrations.  
No value for Kel, T½, AUC 0-inf, AUC %extrap , CL, and V ss, as appropriate, will be reported for 
cases that do not exhibit a terminal log -linear phase in the concentration versus time profile. 
Individual and mean plasma concentration time curves (both linear and log -linear) will be 
included in the final report.

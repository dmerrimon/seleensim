Title: “Medical Cannabis  as an Opi[INVESTIGATOR_271495]”  
NCT number: not yet assgned  
Protocol ID 856134  
Date of Document : October 11, 2024  
Purpose:  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_271496]. 
Philadelphia has been described as “ground   zero” in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_271497]. Some initial clinical experience shows 
that medical marijuana can potentially assist patients suffering from certain serious 
medical conditions by [CONTACT_271513], allowing them 
to discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_858].  
Medical Cannabis is very safe and a viable option for pain relief to improve 
patients and their family’s quality of life. The medical marijuana law  in 
Pennsylvania  was passed in 2016 with the hope that this might alleviate the opi[INVESTIGATOR_271498]. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_271499] 37. 9 per 100,000 people.  
However, medical cannabis is not covered by [CONTACT_271514]. This has been a barrier to some patients trying medical cannabis as an 
alternative. This can create a disparity in care of chronic pain patients.  
Methods : 
 Recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria: Potential participants will be 
recruited from an outpatient chronic pain clinic. [ADDRESS_330947] of the treatment was the main barrier for starting medical cannabis.  
Each participant will undergo  a urine drug screen,  a pain assessment using the 
visual analog scale  and pain quality wi ll be assessed using the SF-36 health related 
quality and McGill Pain Questionnaire, which measures sensory, affective and 
evaluative dimensions of pain prior to receiving medical marijuana  and then at 6 
months . 
 Each patient will be evaluated by a physician who is certified to evaluate 
patients for Medical Cannab is. If the patient qualifies for Medical Cannabis  the 
next step is for the patient to register on the state of Pennsylvania medical 
marijuana website. Medical conditions that qualify patient in the states of 
Pennsylvania for medical marijuana are ALS, Cancer, Crohn’s MS, 
Neurodegenerative diseases, neuropathies, chronic or intractable pain of 
neuropathic origin. After the patient registers the physician will also certify them 
on the websit e. After the patients  are certified they will apply for medical 
marijuana card.  Once the patient receives a medical marijuana card the patient will 
start an opi[INVESTIGATOR_271500]. Each patient will have an individual ized plan for 
weaning off their opi[INVESTIGATOR_271501] . The patient will go to 
the select  medical marijuana dispensary and will be able to choose their  medical 
cannabis  product . The Curaleaf medical cannabis dispensary will have a list of 
patients and they will be able to choose from the cannabis pr oducts.  The patient 
will be followed up monthly for six months by [CONTACT_271515]’s pain levels and Medical Cannabis  doses  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_271502] . We 
will also note the patient side effects, tolerance  and any decrease in symptoms.  At 
six months the physician will recheck  a urine drug screen,  current pain level and 
readminister the McGill Pain Questionnaire  and SF -36 health related quality . The 
Medical Cannabis  doses and strains will be noted.

Research Study Summary for Potential Participant s 
You are being invited to participate in a research study.  Your participation is voluntary, 
and you should only participate if you completely understand what the study requires 
and what the risks of participation are.  You should ask the study team any questions 
you have related to participating before agreeing to join the study.  If you have any 
questions about your rights as a human research participant at any time before, during 
or after participation, please contact [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) at (215) 898 -
2614 for assistance.  
 
The research study is being conducted to  assess the use of medical marijuana 
(cannabis/cannabinoids) as an alternative to opi[INVESTIGATOR_271504]. You have been identified as a patient who may benefit from medical 
cannabis for chronic pain but have been unable to access it due to the high cost or lack 
of availability.     
 
If you agree to join the study,  we will assist you in registering with the Pennsylvania 
Medical Marijuana Program and follow your treatment progress for [ADDRESS_330949] data.  At each visit 
we will assess your health and pain management.  The majority of these assessments 
would occur regardless; however the research may impact their timing or frequency.  
You will also be asked to complete a urine drug screen at the enrollment and at the end 
of the study that would normally be part of your clinical care.   
 
The potential benefits are better pain relief with a safer medication than the opi[INVESTIGATOR_271505]. The most common risks of participation are  worsening pain, withdrawal 
symptoms from weaning of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], side effects from the medical cannabis which 
include palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], paranoia, increased appetite and/or altered mental state.  
 
Alternatives to participating in this research study are to continue with your current 
medication, enroll in a trial of physical therapy, or other adjunct non opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], 
holistic remedies or surgical interventions.  Medical marijuana is also available outside 
this research study.  
 
Please note that there are other factors to consider before agreeing to participate , such as additional 
procedures, use of your personal information, costs, and other possible risks not discussed here. If you 
are interested in participating, a member of the study team will review the full information with you. 
You are free to decline or stop  participation at any time during or after the initial consenting process.  
 
Why am I being asked to volunteer?  
You are being invited to participate in a research study because  you have suffered from 
chronic pain and are taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_271506] a barrier to access.  
 
Your doctor may be an investigator in this research study. You do not have to 
participate in any research study offered by [CONTACT_4904].  If you choose not to participate, 
there will be no loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You may also 
decide to discuss the study  with your family, friends, or family doctor. Being in a 
research study is different from being a patient. As an investigator, your doctor is 
interested both in your clinical welfare and in the conduct of this study.  
 
If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form.   
 
What is the purpose of this research study?  
The purpose of this study is to assess medical cannabis as an alternative to opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a population 
where cost is a barrier to access. Medical cannabis, while available for medicinal purposes in 
Pennsylvania, is not FDA approved for any use.  Insurance does not generally cover its cost.  We plan to 
facilitate access to medical cannabis for patients with chronic pain who would otherwise be unable to 
access this possible opi[INVESTIGATOR_271495].  
 
How long will I be in the study?  
The study should take one year to complete but your involvement will be approximately 6 months. We 
plan to enroll approximately 40 participants in this study. You will continue to follow with your care 
provider after completion of the study.  
 
What am I being asked to do?  
You’re are being asked to consult with your physician on an individualized pain management plan 
including medical cannabis.  The research team will provide support to help you sign up for the 
Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Program. Once you receive your card your name [CONTACT_271529]. This will give you access to medical cannabis product at dispensary. You 
will provide information on your medical history and the history of your  pain . This will include 
information on all treatments you received for your pain  in the past.  You will be asked about your age, 
date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity . You will have your height, weight and vitals signs taken.  
  
 
You will be required to complete a urine drug screen at the beginning of the study and the end. Your 
medical care and medication management, including medical cannabis use, will be overseen by [CONTACT_271516].  
 
You will work with your physician on tapering, if possible, of your opi[INVESTIGATOR_271507]. You will meet with your physician monthly to assess your health 
and adjust your pain management plan as necessary.  At the beginning and end of study you will be 
given McGill Pain questionnaire and Short Form [ADDRESS_330950] clinical care, the timing, frequency, and specific 
measures may be impacted by [CONTACT_53775].  
 
What are the possible risks or discomforts?  
Breach of confidentiality is the main risk of participation.  Procedures are in place to protect your 
identity and health information, hence we believe this risk is low.  
 
There are risks associated with medical cannabis use and withdrawal of opi[INVESTIGATOR_158263].  Your doctor 
should discuss these risks with you separate from this research consent because your medication and 
medical care should not be dictated or impacted by [CONTACT_271517].  
 
Side effects of medical cannabis may include (vary by [CONTACT_141599], potency and amount used):  
• dizziness  
• interactions w/medication  
• anxiety

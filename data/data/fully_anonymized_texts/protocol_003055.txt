We are doing this research study to find out how and where ketamine acts in the brain.   Ketamine 
is an anesthetic (a drug or agent used to decrease or eliminate the feeling of pain by [CONTACT_638066]). 
We will look at your brain using a machine that records your brain’s electrical activity, called an 
electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG is a routine test done at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ketamine for general anesthesia (loss 
of consciousness) before and during surgery. During this research study, you will receive ketamine 
at a high enough dose to induce general anesthesia (make you “fall asleep”).  We are asking you 
to take part because you are a healthy adult and are not currently taking medicines that affect brain 
function. We expect to enroll 15 people in this research study at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(MGH).

During this visit, we will ask you some questions and do some tests to see if you qualify to take 
part in this research study.  The study doctor will review the results of these questions, tests, and 
procedures.  If you do not qualify, the study doctor will tell you why.  
At this visit, we will:
Ask about your medical history
Give you some questionnaires to fill out about your general health and well-being
Give you a physical exam, including measuring your height, weight, and vital signs 
Test your urine for drugs 
Draw a blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) for routine laboratory tests, if no recent tests 
performed at a Partners affiliated institution are available
Test your urine for pregnancy, if you are a female able to become pregnant. Pregnant 
women cannot take part in this study. 
Do an ECG (electrocardiogram). This test checks the electrical activity of your heart.  We 
will place several small, sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs.  Each pad has a wire 
attached.  The wires connect to a machine that makes a recording of your heart rhythm.  
This painless test takes about 15 minutes.  
Please bring a copy of your insurance card to the screening visit for verification of health 
insurance coverage.
Urine Drug Screen
During this study, we will test your urine for certain drugs, including illegal drugs, such as cocaine 
and marijuana.  If your urine shows you have taken any of these drugs, you can’t be in this study.  
The results of the urine drug test will not become part of your medical record.  These test results 
will, however, remain part of your study record.  
Study Visit 2– EEG with ketamine
For safety reasons, you must have nothing to eat or drink for [ADDRESS_853104] prior to the administration of 
ketamine. 
Up to 256 EEG electrodes will be placed on your head using a special hat (“EEG cap”). This will 
not require us to remove any of your hair. A small amount of EEG paste will be applied to each 
electrode and directly to the skin of your scalp to improve contact [CONTACT_239395].  
We will place the following monitors on you:

Heart monitor
Blood pressure cuff
Oxygen saturation monitor (plastic device that is put on  your finger to measure the 
amount of oxygen in your blood) 
Skin conductance (how well your skin conducts electricity) will be measured with 
sensors placed on your fingers.  
Breathing volume (amount of air that is moved in and out of your lungs) will be 
measured using belts that are placed around your chest and abdomen (belly). 
Large cuff, similar to the blood pressure cuff, will be placed around your leg to produce a 
painful feeling (pain stimuli cuff). 
You will have an IV catheter (small, flexible tube) placed in an arm vein.  The IV catheter will be 
used to give you fluids or medications. 
During the study, a board-certified anesthesiologist will be present whose sole responsibility will 
be to monitor your safety. 
Ketamine will be given to you over the course of [ADDRESS_853106] your vital signs and brain waves (EEG) the entire time.  We may administer a medication 
called glycopyrrolate if ketamine causes you to produce excessive saliva. We may also administer 
a medication called labetalol if ketamine causes high blood pressure.
During the baseline period, about 10-15 minutes before we start giving you ketamine and while 
you are getting it, we will present you with an auditory stimulus.  During this time, you will listen 
to a series of “clicks” through a set of headphones placed in your ears. These clicks will be used 
to measure how your hearing functions while you are under anesthesia. 
Next, you will hear a command to click a mouse. Your response to this command will help us 
determine whether or not you are under anesthesia. This overall pattern of clicks and verbal 
command sounds will be repeated many times.  Before you are under anesthesia, we will practice 
this together until you become familiar and comfortable with the task. When you wake up and 
become aware of these sounds, you should continue performing the task.
During the baseline period and while you are waking up, we may inflate (blow up with air) the 
cuff on your leg to produce a painful feeling. This cuff is attached to a machine that controls the 
pressure of the air that will inflate the cuff. The pressure from this cuff is controlled and will be at 
a safe and tolerable range. The air pressure in the cuff will be increased for a period of time to 
cause slight discomfort. The pain should go away within several seconds after the cuff is deflated. 
Each individual experience of brief pain is called a pain stimulus. During the cuff calibration 
period, as well as throughout the study visit, you will be asked to rate your pain on a scale of 1 to

10 as “painful”; and (5) 10 as “maximum pain.”
While you are receiving the study drug, we may also begin an audio and video recording. The 
purpose of these recordings will be to relate your physical behavior to changes in your heart rate, 
blood pressure, breathing pattern, and oxygen intake during the transition to and from general 
anesthesia. 
After you wake up, you will be asked to answer some questions to assess your thinking and 
wakefulness. These questions will be administered twice, [ADDRESS_853108] be present regardless of the mode of transportation you

What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research study?
Risks of Ketamine
Once enough ketamine has been given so that you are under general anesthesia, you may stop 
breathing on your own. This is an expected response to the ketamine. If this happens, the 
anesthesiologist will gently assist your breathing by [CONTACT_1299] a mask over your nose and mouth. 
This may be done for up to [ADDRESS_853113] patient 
to breathe in the operating room. If this is done, you may notice a circular region of redness around 
your mouth and nose. There is also a slight chance that you may experience stomach insufflation 
and vomiting.

high blood pressure
increased heart rate
irregular hear rate
increased saliva
increased mucus
eye twitching
hallucinations/clear dreams that may seem real
confusion
irritated feeling when waking up
floating sensation (feeling “out-of-body”) lasting from minutes to hours.
breathing problems, coughing
nausea, vomiting
twitching, muscle jerks, and muscle tension
increased thirst
headaches
metallic taste
constipation
blurry or double vision
involuntary eye movements
low mood or suicidal thoughts
allergic reaction (skin rash)
pain at site of injection
increased intraocular pressure
ulcerations and inflammation in the bladder
When giving any general anesthetic, there is always the possibility of very rare side effects or 
complications such as nerve damage, heart attack, brain damage, or even death. However, giving 
ketamine for sedation and maintenance of general anesthesia, at the doses you will receive in this 
study, is a standard practice in nearly every surgical center nationwide. Therefore, while the side 
effects and complications listed above are possible, life threatening side-effects are highly 
unlikely.
Any acute changes in heart rate or blood pressure observed during the study will be treated using 
standard anesthesiology practices. 
Risks of Taking Glycopyrrolate

Glycopyrrolate is a drug that is used in the operating room every day.  It is used to treat heart rate 
changes while a person is under general anesthesia. Glycopyrrolate may be given to you through 
the intravenous catheter to treat excessive salivation.
Common problems with glycopyrrolate (more than 1 out of 10) include dry mouth. Less common 
(between 1 and 10 out of 100) are abnormal heart rhythm (your heart not beating at an even pace),  
nausea, blurry vision and difficulty urinating.
Risks of Labetalol
Labetalol is a drug that is used to treat blood pressure changes while a person is under general 
anesthesia. Labetalol may be given to you through the intravenous catheter to decrease your blood 
pressure to a normal range. An anesthesiologist will monitor your blood pressure and heart rate 
and will give you labetalol to treat high blood pressure, if needed. Risks of labetalol include low 
blood pressure and low heart rate. 
Risks of Intravenous (IV) Catheter 
You may have a bruise (a black and blue mark) or pain where we place the IV. There is also a 
small risk of infection, lightheadedness, and fainting. 
Risk of EEG Electrodes
There is a possibility that you may experience some redness or itching where the electrodes are 
placed. 
Risks of Pain Stimuli Cuff 
You may have a bruise (a black and blue mark) on your leg from the inflation of the cuff. In our 
experience, this is infrequent (occurs in less than 5 out of 100 people). A simple button press 
(controlled by [CONTACT_3476]) can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_638065], to make sure you are safe. The pain 
cuff will only be used when you are awake enough to talk to study team members. You can 
request that the cuff be deflated if it is too painful.
Risks of Allergic Reaction
As with any drug, an allergic reaction can occur.  Allergic reactions can be mild or more serious, 
and can even result in death.  Common symptoms of an allergic reaction are rash, itching, skin 
problems, swelling of the face and throat, or trouble breathing. If you think you are having an 
allergic reaction, tell the study doctor right away.  
Risks to an Embryo or Fetus, or to a Breastfeeding Infant
The effect of ketamine on an embryo or fetus (developi[INVESTIGATOR_191278]), or on a 
breastfeeding infant, is unknown and may be harmful.  Because of these unknown risks, women 
cannot take part in this study if they are:
Pregnant
Trying to become pregnant

tied), or transvaginal occlusion (plugging the opening of the tubes with a coil.
What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?
You will not benefit from taking part in this study.  What we learn in this study may help 
researchers develop improved anesthetics and anesthesia monitoring equipment in the future.  It 
may also help researchers develop better pain management strategies. This may improve medical 
care for patients receiving anesthesia in the future.
Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don’t take part in this 
research study, or if I stop taking part?
Yes.  Your decision won’t change the medical care you get within Partners now or in the future.  
There will be no penalty, and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now or have a right to 
receive.
Taking part in this research study is up to you.  You can decide not to take part.  If you decide to 
take part now, you can change your mind and drop out later.  We will tell you if we learn new 
information that could make you change your mind about taking part in this research study.
What should I do if I want to stop taking part in the study?
If you take part in this research study, and want to drop out, you should tell us.  We will make 
sure that you stop the study safely.  We will also talk to you about follow-up care, if needed.
Also, it is possible that we will have to ask you to drop out of the study before you finish it.  If 
this happens, we will tell you why.  We will also help arrange other care for you, if needed.
Will I be paid to take part in this research study?
We will pay you $500 if you complete both study visits.

PRÉCIS  
Background:  
• Combination immunotherapy approaches ar e being act ively explored to further improve 
response s, enhance clinical bene fit, and overcome resistance to PD(L)- 1 agents in cancer 
participant s.  
• Interleukin -8 (IL -8) is a pro- inflammatory chemokine produced by [CONTACT_625869]. 
Overexpression of IL-8 and/or its  receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, is commonly seen i n 
many human cancers i ncluding breast, cervical, melanoma and prostate.  
• SX-682 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of the CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors that are 
believed involved in MDSC- recruitm ent to tumor and other pro- tumoral mec hanisms.  
• Bintrafusp a lfa (M7824 or MSB0011359C) is a bifunctional protein composed of the 
extracellular domain of the TGF -βRII receptor (TGF -β “trap”) fused  to a human IgG1. 
Preclinical data shows bintrafusp al fa trea tment increases  T-cell trafficking, an tigen -
specific CD8+ T -cell lysis and NK cell activation. 
• CV301  is a poxviral -based vaccine comprised of recombinant Modified vaccinia Ankara 
(MVA- BN-CV301 , prime) and recombinant fowlpox (FPV -CV301, boost). CV301  
contai ns transgenes encoding two (2) tumor -associated antigens (T AA), mucin 1 (MUC1) 
and ca rcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), as well as three costimulatory molecules (B7.1, 
ICAM -1 and LFA -3, designated TR ICOM). A recent phase [ADDRESS_833796] participant s.  
• Preclinical studies performed in LTIB with SX -682, M7824 and a CEA- based vaccine 
showed a significant reduction in tumor growth a s well as a significan t increase in tumor 
infiltration with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  
Objectives:  
• Arm 1 (Sequential Dose Escalation):  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent SX-682. 
 To determi ne the MTD of SX -[ADDRESS_833797] udy will be focused to describe the safety and tolerability of SX -682 
followed by M7824 and CV301  vaccines. 
• Arm 2 (Combination Dose Escalation):  
 To de termine the recomm ended phase  2 dose (RP2D)  of SX -682 with M7824 and 
CV301  vaccines in participant s with adva nced or metastatic solid tumors. If the 
MTD is not reached the study will be focused to describe the safety and 
tolerability of the drug com bination. 
• Arm 3 (Expansio n): 
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
3  To eval uate preliminary effica cy based on Objective Response Rat e (ORR), in 
each disease c ohort separately.  
Eligibility:  
• Age > 18 years old 
• Arms  1 and 2 (Dose -Escalation Cohort): Subjects with cytologically or histologically 
confirmed locally advanced or metastat ic solid tumors.  
• Arm 3 (Expansion Cohorts): 
o TNBC: Subjec ts with cytologically o r histologically confirmed locally advanced 
or metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer that has progressed on at least one 
prior treatment in the advanced or in the metastatic  setting.  
o HPV negative  HNSCC: Subjects with cytologicall y or histologically con firmed 
locally advanced or metastatic, HPV negative  head and neck squamous cell 
cancer (p16 negative  for oropharyngeal) that has progressed on at least one prior 
treatment invo lving a platinum drug  or cetuxi mab in advanced or in the m etastatic 
setting.  
• Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless there is no standard treatment 
available, the participant  cannot tolerate standard  first line treatment, or the par ticipant 
declines standard treatm ent after approp riate counseling has been provided.  
• ECOG perform ance status of 0 to 1  
• Adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function 
• Subjects in Arms  [ADDRESS_833798] disease that  is measurable or non- measurable but 
evaluable dis ease (e.g. present on b one scan, rising tumor markers, non -measur able by 
[CONTACT_625870]). Participant s with third space fluid (for example pleural 
effusions) as only site of disease wi ll not be eligible. Subjects in Arm  [ADDRESS_833799] 1.1  
Design:  
• Arm 1 is a phase I, open- label, 3+3 sequential dos e escalation trial with short term , 2-
week  SX-682 monotherapy lead- in followed by [CONTACT_27180] M7824 and CV301 
vaccine series in advanced solid tumors ( Q2W dosing schedule) for the dura tion of 
treatment.  
• Arm 2 is a phase I, open -label, 3+3 combination dose escalation trial with short term SX -
682 monotherapy lead in followed by [CONTACT_625871] -682 combination with M7824 and CV301  
vaccine series in advanced solid tumor s (Q2W dosing schedule). Each enrolled 
participant  will re ceive SX -682 as monotherap y for 2 weeks then will  receive SX -682, 
M7824 and CV301  for the duration of treatment  
• Arm 3 has two  expansion cohorts. F ollowing identification of the MTD or R2PD for the 
combination of SX -682, M7824 and CV301 vaccine, disease -specific phase 2 expansion 
cohorts will open in 1) a dvanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer and 2) 
advanced/metastatic, platinum -refractory  HPV negative head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma.

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is  an open label Phase I/II  trial, consis ting of a safety  run-in phase  I (Arms 1 and 2) and an 
expansion phase II , disea se-specif ic cohorts ( Arm 3). 
In Arm 1  the safety and MTD dose of short term (2 weeks) S X-682 monothera py lead-in 
following by t reatment wi th M7824 and CV301  will b e determined i n participants with solid 
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial

46 tumo rs (Schema 1 ). An eval uation of DLTs  (eDLTs) will o ccur at the completion of each dose 
level an d will be done prior t o enrolling on the next dose level.  
In Arm 2 the safety , MTD /RP2D o f continuing treatme nt of SX -682 in combination with M7824 
and CV301  will be determined in participant s with so lid tumors ( Schema 2). An eva luation of 
DLTs (eDLTs) will occur a t the com pletion of each dose level and  will be done prior to e nrolling 
on the next dose level.  
During Arm 3 expansion cohort s, when RP2D of SX- 682 in combination with M7824 and 
CV301  is estimated, we will  proceed with e nrollment to Cohorts 2 ( participant s with triple 
negative breast cancer) and Cohort 3 ( participant s with HP V negative  head and neck canc er) to 
evaluate efficacy of  the SX-682 in combination with M7824 and CV301  (Schema 3 ).  
SX-682 will be self -adminis tered by [CONTACT_625878] d aily according to designated 
Dose Level (  Table 4).  
Admini stration of M7824 will b e at a flat dose of 1 ,200 mg every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_24636] . Participants 
will receive M7824 treatment ev ery 14 ( -1/+3) days.  
CV301  will be administered at a flat dose for both the prime and booster vaccines. The priming 
MVA- BN-CV30 1 is delivered as four subcutaneous injections of 4x108 infectiou s units 
(Inf.U)/0.5 mL every 14 days for 2 doses (Cycle 1, Day 1  and Cycle 1, Day 15). FPV -CV301 is 
given subcutaneously at 1×109Inf.U/0.5 mL every 4 wee ks start ing on Cycle 2 Day 1 x 4 cycle s 
then on Day 1 of every 3 cycles (every 12 weeks) for up to 1 ye ar on trial. Participant s will 
receive CV3 01 as scheduled ( -1/+3) days . 
Subjects on all arms will recei ve combined tr eatment with study drugs for up to 2 years (BN-
CV301 will be administered for up to 1 year on  trial; M7824 and SX -682 will be administered 
for up to 2 years on trial). Furthermore,  after 2 years on treat ment with  M7824 and/or SX -682, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_625825] p artners as long as in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_625826] . 
Disease progression should be conf irmed wit h a subsequent scan [ADDRESS_833819] of off treatme nt criteria,

3.1.1 Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Dose -limiting toxicity ( DLT ) will be defined as an y one of t he following adverse e vents (AEs), 
as defined by [CONTACT_625879] E v5.0, possibly attribu table to study drugs by [CONTACT_737], that occur 
within 28 days after t he start  of study therapy:  
• Any Grade 4 AEs, except for: 
o  laboratory values that are determined  to not be clinically significan t or single 
laboratory valued t hat re solve to Gr ade ≤ 1 or baseline grade within 7 days with 
adequate medical management.  
o adverse drug reaction which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_625827] e participant (e.g. 
placemen t of a  pleura l catheter for recurrent inflammatory pleural effusions)  
• Average QTcf ≥  501 msec or > 60 msec change from baseline (Grade 3)  
• Any Grade 3 AEs except  for a ny of the following: 
o Grade 3 flu -like symptoms or fever, as well as associated sympto ms of  fatig ue, 
headaches, nausea, emesis which can be controlled with conservative medical 
management.  
o Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of known or suspected tumor. 
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
49 o Any Grade ≥ 3 drug- related amylase or lipas e abnormality  that is no t associated 
with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis.  
o Grade 3 Hgb decrease (< 8.0 g/dL) that is clinically manageable with blood 
transfusions or erythroid growth factor use does not require tre atment 
discontinuatio n.  
o Keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  
o Any endocrinopathy that can be medically managed with hormone replacement  
o Grade 3 neutropenia without fever 
o Since the safety profile of M7824 is well characterized (see IB) , a single grade 3 
adverse event known to be associated with M7824, as per IB section 6.2.6 will not be considered a DLT. 
 Additionally , M7824 has a known potential to cause bleeding , with a rate 
of grade 3 bleeding events as high as 15.3% [ 92].  The refore a grade 3 
bleeding e vent will not be considered a DLT.  
o Any grade 3 adverse drug reaction which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_625828] b e medic ally manage d with minimal risk to the 
participant  (e.g. placement of a pleural catheter fo r recurrent in flammatory pleural 
effusions) 
• Any grade 3 or higher adverse event or unexpected toxicities due to the combina tion of 
therapie s that would not be expe cted wi th individual agents alone, will be considered a 
DLT . 
3.1.2 Dose Escala tion Common Rules 
Starting dose of SX -682 wi ll be 25 mg by [CONTACT_104744] (50 mg total daily dose). 
The first 3 partic ipant s enrolled on a given dose level of Arms 1 and 2 will be observed  for DLT. 
If no  DLT i n those 3 participants, the next dos e level will open. If DLT(s) occur, see Table 5. 
There will be a n interval of at least [ADDRESS_833820] ≥85 per cent of SX -682 scheduled 
doses were taken and 100% of scheduled doses of M7824 or CV301  were administered  within 
the DLT peri od. 
In case of DLT, DLT will be documented and participant , per PI [INVESTIGATOR_625829], may continue study 
treatment if toxicity could be managed by [CONTACT_625880] (See sect ion 3.4). Participant , once having DLT, will not be used for DLT evalua tion 
on another dose level if treated on a lo wer dose level.  
Any of the trial drugs may be discontinued for toxicity per th e discretion of the p rimary 
investigator if is it felt that the toxicity can be directly linked to a spe cific drug or drugs . Per PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_625830] T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/[ADDRESS_833821] be discon tinued, the participant  will be taken off tre atme nt. 
3.1.3 Sequential Dose Escalation  (Arm 1)  
In Arm 1 participants wil l recei ve SX -682 as monotherapy for  2 weeks during the lead-in (Day s -
14L to -1L) and then continue treatment with M7824 and CV301 starting Cycle 1, Day 1.  
The dose escal ation will sta rt from dose level 1 and continue until dose level 3 ( Table 4 ) in 
sequential order us ing a standa rd 3+3 design ( Table 5 ). Aside from looking at DLTs within a 
given dose level , the t otal number of DLTs will  also be evaluated among the initial 3DL s in Arm 
1 to guide  further safety assessments.  If there are 0 DLT s reported in the initial 3 DLs 
(minimum of 12 participants) in Arm 1, then Arm [ADDRESS_833822] 3  
DLs, enrollment in Arm 1 will continue with the next participants being enrolled on DL4 then 
DL5, using a 3+3 design in order to determi ne the maximally to lerated dose (MTD) before 
proceeding to Arm 2 , DL 1 .  
Dose escalation will proceed in groups  of 3–[ADDRESS_833823] 2 (of ≤6) participants have DLT as a result of the drug.

3.1.4 Combination Dose Escalation  (Arm 2) 
In Arm 2  participan ts wi ll receive SX -682 as monotherapy for the lead -in (Days -14L to -1L) and 
then will continue treatment with SX -[ADDRESS_833825] been treated in  Arm 1  at dose level 3 without DLT during DLT period, the 
dose escalation of SX -682 will start from dose level 2 and continue until dose level 5 ( Table 4 ) 
in sequential order using a standard 3+3 design ( Table 5 ). 
If there was 1 or more DLT in Arm 1  at dose level 1 through 3 during DLT period, the dose 
escalation of SX -682 will start  from dose level 1 and continue until dose level  5 (Table  4) in 
sequential order using a standard 3+3 design ( Table 5 ). 
If in Arm 1 dose level 1 or 2 are estimated as MTD, we will submit an amendment with 
justification for study continuation.  
Dose escalation will proceed in groups  of 3–[ADDRESS_833826] 2 (of ≤6) participant s hav e DLT as a result of the drug.  The RP2D

53 3.3 DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
3.3.1 General Dosing Rules: 
Excep t where stated otherwise in the study calendar a window of - 1/+ 3 da ys for every two 
weeks M7824 dosing and/or study calendar a window of - 1/+ 3 days for the scheduled CV3 01 
dosing is allowed in the event of scheduling issues (i.e. holiday, bad weather or other scheduling 
issues). Any dose that cannot be accommodated within this window will be skipped and the dose not made up. Similar drug administrations should not be given less than 11 days from one another.  
The preferred order of drug administration in the day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_625832]301 , then M7824 
administration; when possible,  administer the vaccine within 60 minutes prior to the M7824 
administration; however, the exact timing of vaccine administration is flexible.  
3.3.2 SX-682  
SX-682 will be given orally at designated dose  twi ce a day every day. SX -682 is available as a 
25 mg and a 100 mg tablet. If necessary, the 100 mg tablets can be cut in half using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_625833]; 
the tablets are pre -scored for this purpose. The tablets are not to be crushed, chewed, or dissolved 
before swallowing.  
SX-682 should be taken at approxima tely the same times each day. Participants should take SX -
682 with water once in the morning ( suggested between 6 -9 am) and once  in the e vening 
(suggested between 6 -9 pm). For two hours before and one  hour after the dose, the participant ’s 
diet should be limited to  clear liquids only (no solid foods). Doses should be taken within 2 hours 
of the scheduled time.   
In case of a missed do se (more than 2 hours late) or vomiting after taking SX -682, participants 
will be instructed not to make up the missed dose. Up to 15% of scheduled doses of SX -682 can be missed per cycle unless directed by P I/AI to 
hold additional doses of SX-682 during a planned cycle.  
Participant s will complete and return Participant ’s Diary  (Appendix C ), which  will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_625881] e. 
3.3.3 CV301  Vaccines  
Participant s will be p rimed with MVA -BN-CV301 twice during Cycle 1 (Days 1 and 15), 
followed by [CONTACT_625882] -CV301 on Day 1 of subsequent cycles (every 4 we eks) x 
4 cycles  (Cycle 2 through Cycle 5) then on Day 1 of e very 3 cycles (Cycles 8 and Cycle 11).  
A single dose of MVA -BN-CV301 is given as four subcutaneous injections with each of these 
injections containing 4x108 Inf.U/0.5ml. Each injection will be given in a  different arm or leg.  
A dose of FPV -CV301 is given as one subcutaneous injection with each i njection containing 
1x109 Inf.U/0.5ml. For participant comfort, it is generally preferred if FPV -CV301 is 
administered in the upper arm; however, the vacc ine can b e given in any extremity. 
3.3.4 M7824  
Subjects will be scheduled to receive M7824 at a flat  dose of  1,200 mg IV on Days 1 and 15 of 
each cycle.  
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
54 Subjects will receive M7824 via IV infusion over 1 hour ( -10 minutes / +20 minutes, that is, over 
50 to 80 minutes) once every 2 weeks. Infusion rate may be adjusted in the event of certain 
adverse events as described in section 3.4.4. M7824 can be administered through a central line 
(preexisting) or a peripheral IV. A 0.[ADDRESS_833829]  of acceptable materials known t o be compatible 
with M7824. 
In order to mitigate potential infusion -related reaction s, premedic ation with an antihistamine and 
with acetaminophen (for example, 25-50 mg diphenhydramine and 500-650 mg acetaminophen) 
within approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to dos ing of M7824 is optional and at the discretio n 
of the Investigator. Steroid s as premed ication are not permitted . 
3.4 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
3.4.1 General Rules  
When, at the beginning of a treatment week , treat ment delay related to one of study drugs is 
indicat ed, treat ment with other drugs should not be delayed.  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a toxicity is considered to be due solely to one drug, the 
dose of other drugs does not require modification. 
Any of the trial drugs may be held for toxicity per  the disc retion of the primary investigator if is 
it felt that the toxicity can be d irectly lin ked to a specific drug. For AEs that are attributed to a 
study drug, a study drug may be held or reduced (only SX -682 can be reduced)  when in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_625834] (e.g., in the event of observed tumor reduction but also intole rable ADRs at the full 
dose).  
If one drug is discontinued during first year of treatment, a partici pant may per PI [INVESTIGATOR_625835] [ADDRESS_833830] be discontinued, the participant 
will be taken off treatment. If one drug is discontinued during second year of treatment, a 
participant  may per PI d iscretion contin ue treatm ent with the othe r drug . 
For non- medical logistical reason s, unrelated acute illnesse s, or palliative radiation, dosing with 
any drug can be delayed up to 2 months. Where at all possible, dosing should be restarted to keep 
in line with the origina l treatme nt schedule.  
For AEs that are unrelated to the study drugs, study drug(s) may be held for up to [ADDRESS_833831] occurred within this window will be skipped and the dose not made up. 
If a participant on trial c ontinue
 s to gain benefit  from treatment with one or more of the trial 
drugs at the two -year mark , the investigator can discuss with the CRADA partners the possibil ity 
of continuing the participant on treatment with the assigned trial drugs  for an additiona l specified 
period of time.  
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/[ADDRESS_833832] will be medically treated for the 
event. 
If the AE reduces t o a lowe r tolerab le grade the study treatment might be resume d in the 
subsequent week. If the AE remains the s ame despi[INVESTIGATOR_625836] (second cycle a fter the AE occurred) a consideration of a possible extension of the 
dose interr uption for u p to [ADDRESS_833833] cl inical significance and are not related 
to study drugs do not require dose interruption. 
3.4.2 SX-682 
If any SX -682 related AE observed is grade > 2 (except for electrolyte abnormalities that can be 
easil
y rep lenished or other lab abnormalities that have no clin ical consequence or can be easily 
medically managed with minimal risk to the participant ), treatment should be delayed by 1 wee k 
(except for hyperbilirubinemia where drug will be held for grade 2) – and up to  [ADDRESS_833834] ill not resolved (to grade ≤ 1), then 
any furt her treatment with SX -682 should be delayed until AEs are resolved (to grade ≤ 1), and 
then reduced by [CONTACT_625883] .  
3.4.3 CV301  
Dose delays or dose omissi ons of CV301  vaccines are allowed  per P I discretion . There are no 
dose reductions for the CV301  vaccines.  
3.4.4 M7824 
Dose delays or dose omissions of M7824 are allowed per PI d iscretion . There are no dose 
reductions for M7824.  [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) Requiring Treatment Discontinuation  
All adverse events in this trial will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for

57 suggestions based on current knowledge; however, given this is an evolving field, 
investigators are encouraged to consult professional guidelines.  
o In addition to NCCN gui delines, th e following  recom mendations should be 
considered when managing irAEs:  
• Permanent treatment discontinuation is required in case of immune -related 
Grade 4 rash/inflammatory dermatitis, nephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, aplastic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, a cquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
inflammatory arthritis, myositis and polymyalgia -like syndrome.  
 
• For Grade 4 immune -related lymphopenia, permanent treatment 
discontinuation will be required, if lymphopen ia is considered immu ne-
related in natur e, no cl ear alternative explanation exists for the event, and 
it does not resolve within 14 days. Permanent treatment discontinuation is not required when the AE is manifested by a single laboratory value out of norm al range without any clinical correlat es. In this case, treatment should 
be held until the etiology is determined. If the event is not considered immune -related and resolves to Grade ≤ 1, restarting treatment may be 
considered.  
 
• For Grade 1 immune -related pneumonitis: continue treatment. If c linically 
indicated, monitor participants weekly or more frequently as needed with history, physical examination and pulse oximetry. If symptoms appear and/or changes in the physical exam are noted, treat as Grade 2.  
 
•  For myositis  requiring management with rituxim ab, treatment should be 
discontinued.  
 
• For Grade 3 or 4 endocrinopathies: withhold until cli nically stable or 
permanently discontinue depending on severity.  
 
• For hepatitis with no tumor involvement of the liver: withhold if tot al 
bilirubin increa ses to m ore than 1.[ADDRESS_833838]  
 
• Hepatitis with tumor involvement of the liver: permanently discontinue if 
total bilirubin increases to more than [ADDRESS_833839].

58 • An IRR should be considered when onset is on the day of infusion (during or after the 
infusion) or the day after the infusion (irrespective of resolution date) for any infusion related 
reaction, drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactic  reaction , hype rsensitivity  and/or Type 1 
hypersensitivity. 
• Signs and symptoms of infusion related reactions and hype rsensitivity/allergic reactions 
should be considered when onset is on the day of infusion (during or after the infusion) and 
resolved compl etely with the end date wit hin 2 days after onset. Signs and symptoms may 
include but not limited to: fever, chills or shaking, rigors, flushing, hypotension, wheezing, pruritus, rash and hypoxemia, shortness of breath, back or neck pain, facial swelling, dizziness, feel ing of passi ng out. 
Infusion- related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (Grades 1 to 4) should be handled 
according to the best medical judgement based on the most  updated professional guidelines 
(NCCN, ESMO, SITC, etc .). Guidelines provided in Table 6  are merely suggestions based on 
current knowledge; howeve r, given this is an evolving field, investigators are encouraged to 
consult the most updated professional guidelines. 
Table 6: Trea tmen t Modifications for Symptoms of Infusion -related Reactions  
NCI-CTCAE Grade  Treatment Modificatio n for M7824  
Grade 1 – mild  
Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption 
not indicated; intervention not indicated. Consider decreasing th e infusio n rate  of the 
particular agent by 50% and monitoring 
closely for any worsening. 
 
Grade 2 – moderate  
Therap y or infusion interruption indicated but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment 
(e.g., antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, i.e. 
fluids); prophylac tic me dications in dicated for 
≤ 24 hours.  Consider temporarily discontinuing infusion 
of the particular age nt. 
Consider resuming infusion of the particular 
agent at 50% of previous rate once infusion 
related reaction has resolved or decreased to 
at least Grade 1 in severity  and monitor 
closely for any worsening.  
Grade 3 or Grade 4 – severe or life -
threatening  
Grade 3:  Prolonged (e.g., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_20309]/or brief interruption of infusion); hospi[INVESTIGATOR_625838].  
Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; 
urgent intervention indicated.  Stop the infusion imm ediately and disconnect 
infusion tubing from the subject.  
For grade 3 events:  Consider withdrawing 
immediately from treatment with that 
particular agent and not offeri ng any further 
treatment with that agent based upon if the 
clinical condition can be safe ly managed. 
For grade 4 events: Withdraw immediately 
from treatment and do not offer further 
treatment with that agent.  
 If the infusion rate of M7824 has be en decreased by 50% or interrupted due to an infusion 
reaction, keep it decreased for the next sc heduled infusion. If no infusion reaction is observed in 
the next scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be returned to baseline at the s ubsequent 
infusions based on investigator’s medical judgment.

safety analysis set from a total of 765  participants, refer to IB v7) and/or SX -682. For M7824 
anemia i s an AESI and important identified risk (see Investigators’ Brochure ). Notably, there are 
many reasons for hemo rrhage and/or anemia in patient s with advanced cancer, and Hb level of at 
least 9 g/d L is required for this study. A thorough investigation of ne w anemia cases of 
unspecifie d etiology is re commended: 
• Participants must enter the study with Hgb values at lea st 9 g/ dL a nd baseline anemia 
evaluation is conducted per recommendations below.  
• Consider hematology consult for severe and or refractory anemi as.

Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
67 • All relevant h ematologic  testing for treatment related anemias should be done prior to blood 
transfusion, i f clini cally feasible.  
• Transfusion  should be performed at the discretion of the investigator, based on clinical 
assessment and considered when p articipant experien ces significant anemia.  
• Guidance  for evaluation of baseline anemia or suspected treatment -related  anemi as is 
provided below. Investigators may consider the following laboratory evaluations in 
participant s with anemia.  
o Hb and CBC with d ifferential (e.g. MCV, RDW, ANC, hematocrit, reticulocytes 
counts) 
o Peripheral blood smear for cell morpho logical assessment  
o Com plete metabolic panel including liver panel -LFTs, bilirubin, LDH, renal function, 
and serum folate, B12 values and other chemistri es 
o Coagulation fac tors (PT,  PTT, INR)  
o Urinalysis including culture 
o Iron panel (TIBC, ferritin, Fe)

Multiple protocols using M7824, several mucosa l bleeding events r anging from low grade 
gingival bleeding and epi[INVESTIGATOR_625840], GI bleeding and he maturia have 
been observed. Some of these events can be attributed to bleeding events related to cancer 
directly and others bleeding even ts can be attributed to an inflammatory process (e.g. colitis) 
which is a known toxicity of anti -PD-L1 ag ents including M7824. However, there remains the 
possibility that M7824 may increase the overall risk of bleeding in ways that may not be directly related to direct tumor bleeding or inflammatory bleeding events described with checkpoint 
inhibitors like M7824. However, there is  no evidence of a negative effect on coagulation or 
platelet number or function. It is hypothesized that this possible increased m ucosal bleeding ri sk 
may be  due to the known mucoprotective effects of TGF β. Accordingly, partici pants will be 
closely  monitored for mucosal bleeding (e.g., gum bleeding, nose bleeds, coughing up blood, 
blood in their urine, or blood in the stool).

6.2.2 Genomic Data Shar ing Plan  
Unlinked genomic data will be deposited in publi c genom ic databases such as dbGaP in 
compliance with the NIH Genomic Data Sh aring Policy. 
6.3 RESPONSE  CRITERIA   
For the purposes of this study, part icipant s should be r e-evaluated for response according to  
schedule in the Study Calendar, section 3.5.  
In the e vent of a PR or CR tumor imaging assessm ents may be performed every 3 months (+ /- 2 
weeks) at the di scretion of the inve stigator. In add ition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans can 
also be obtained [ADDRESS_833856] and MR I scan of the abdomen/pelvis is 
preferred.  Additiona l assessment of tumor re sponse may inclu de the follow ing evaluations ; 
nuclear bone scan for subjects w ith known/suspecte d bone lesions; and CT or M RI scan of the 
brain (only as clinically warranted based on symptoms/findings). Brain CT / MRI scan should b e performed, if clinically indicated by [CONTACT_625902] e Primary Investig ator. For each subject, the  Investiga tor will

90 designate 1 or more of the following m easures of tumor status to follow for determining r esponse: 
CT or MRI images  of primary and / or metastat ic tumor masses, physical examination findings, 
and the results of other assessments. All available imag es collected during the trial period will be 
considered. The most appropriate mea sures to evaluate the tumor status of a su bject should be 
used. The mea sure(s) to be chosen for s equential evaluation during the trial hav e to correspond to 
the measures used to document the progressive tumor status that qualifies the subject for 
enrollment.  
Progressive di sease should be confirmed  by [CONTACT_9661] 4 to 8 weeks (preferably at 4 we eks, but not 
more than 8 weeks) af ter progression ha s been diag nosed according to RECIST 1.1. before the 
participant is removed f rom treatment [ 93]. If progression is based on the occurrence of  a new  
lesion in an area not scanned a t Baseline, a fur ther on- study scan [ADDRESS_833857]  1.1 (all measurement s should be recorde d in 
metric notation).  
To assess objectiv e response, the tumor burden at ba seline will be estimated an d used for  
compar ison with subsequent m easurements. At baseline, tumor lesions w ill be categorized in 
target and non- target lesions according to RECIST 1.1.  
Results for these evaluations will be recorded with as muc h specificity as possible so that pre  and 
post-treatment re sults will provide th e best opportunity f or evaluating tumor r esponse.  
The Inve stigator may perform scans in addition to a scheduled tri al scan for medical reasons or if 
the Investigator suspects P D. 
iRECIST wil l also be used  for exploratory endpoi nts (See section 6.3.3)  
For the primary  endpoint antitumor activity will be evaluated with target an d/or non- target 
lesions according to Resp onse Evaluation Crite ria in Solid T umors (RECIST) Version 1.1 . [93]. 
Palliativ e radiotherapy delivered in a nor mal org an-spearing technique may be administered  
during this trial.  The assessmen t of PD will not be based on the neces sity f or palliative 
radiothe rapy.  
If a target l esion is radiated during the course of t reatment, this ta rget lesion will no longer be 
considered  a measurable lesion and will be removed from the target les ion sum moving forward 
as is recommended in RECISTv1 .1.  
6.3.1 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease : Mea surable l esions are defined as those tha t can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimen sion (l ongest diameter to be recorded) as:  
• By [CONTACT_13190] x -ray: >2 0 mm;   
• By [CONTACT_3610]:  
o Scan slice thickness 5 mm or under: a s >10 mm 
o Scan slice thickness >5 mm: double the  slice thickness  
• With  calipers on clini ca l exam: > 10 mm.  
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/[ADDRESS_833858] be recorded in millimete rs (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Tumor lesions that a re situated in a previousl y irradiate d area  may be considered measurable if 
there is  demonstrated progress ion in the radiate d lesion prior to  starting on the trial.  
Malignan t lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be > [ADDRESS_833859] scan (CT scan  slice thickness re commended 
to be no gre ater than 5 mm). A t baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis w ill be measured 
and followed. 
Non-measurable disease . All oth er les ions (or sites  of disease), including sma ll lesions (longe st 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), ar e considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions,  leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory  breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiog r aphically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cys ts. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represen t cystic metastases can be considered as measurabl e lesio ns, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same participant , these are preferred for s election as target lesions.  
Targe t lesions.  All me asurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 le sions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target le sions  and recorded 
and measured at base line. Target le sions should be selected on the basis of th eir size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), b e representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible re peated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasio n, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumst ance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, s hort axis for nodal lesions)  for all target 
lesions will be  calculate d and reported as the baseline sum diameters. I f lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum di ameters 
will be used as reference to fu rther character ize any objective tumor regression in the m easurable 
dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions . All  other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified a s non-targe t lesions and s hould also be 
recorded at baselin e. Measure ments of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
6.3.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measu rable Disease 
All measuremen ts shoul d be taken and recorded  in metric  notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseli ne evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatme nt. 
The same meth od of assessment and the same t echnique s hould be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) b eing followed c annot be 
imaged but are assessabl e by [CONTACT_411385].  
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
92 Clinical lesions: Clinica l lesions wi ll only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed usi ng calipers  
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesio ns, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesio n, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: Lesio ns on chest x -ray are not acceptable as measurable lesions.  
Conventional CT and MRI:  This guide line has defined measurabi lity of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT sli ce thickness is [ADDRESS_833860] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measura ble lesion should be twice t he slice th ickness. 
MRI is  also acceptable in certain situa tions (e.g. for body scans). 
Use of MRI remains a complex  issue. MR I has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatl y 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI 
is vari able globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. 
Furthermore , as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the sam e as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guide lines to prescribe specifi c MRI pulse sequence paramet ers for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with br eath-hold scanning techniques, if  possible. 
PET- CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT
  is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that t he CT performed as part of a  PET- CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT  in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions ove r tim e. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduc es additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially 
performed. 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound 
 is not useful in assessment of l esion size and sh ould not be used as a 
meth od of  measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduce d in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot b e 
guaranteed that the same t echnique and measurements wi ll be taken from one asses sment  to the 
next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_118582]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in  selected instanc es. 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utiliza
 tion of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to det ermine relapse in trials w here recurrence following co mplete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tum or markers:  Tumo
 r markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially 
above the upper norm al limit, they must normaliz e for a participant to be co nsidered in complete 
clinical response. Specific guidelines for both CA -125 respo nse (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and 
PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published. [ 94-96] In addition, the 
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/[ADDRESS_833861]- line trials  in ovarian cance r.[97]  
Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiat e between partial responses 
(PR) and  complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
The cytological confirmation of th e neoplast ic origin of any effusion t hat ap pears or worsens 
during tr eatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for re sponse or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment ) and progressive disease.  
FDG- PET:  While F DG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reason able to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possibl e 'new' disease) . New lesions on the ba sis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identi fied according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET  at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a po sitive FDG -PET a t follow -up: If the pos itive FDG-
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progressi on 
occur ring at that site (if so , the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal  
FDG- PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basi s of the anatomic image s, this 
is not PD.  
c. FDG- PET may be us ed to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a  biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumsta nce should be prospect ively desc ribed 
in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive 
CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note: A ‘pos itive’ FDG -PET scan lesion  means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
Evaluation of Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis  to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At l east a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as referenc e the baseline sum of diameters.  
Progre ssive Disease (PD) : At lea st a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition t o the relative increase of 20%, t he sum  must also  demonstrate an 
absolute i ncrease of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or  more new lesions is also 
considered progressions). 
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
94 Stable Disease (SD) : Neith er sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient incre ase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum  of diameters while on study. 
Evaluation of Non- Targe t Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -targe t lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nod es must be non-pa thological in size (<1 0 mm short a xis). 
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they mus t normaliz e for a 
participant  to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Per sistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumo r 
mark er level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appear ance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non- target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
targe t lesion status. It must be repres entative of overall disea se status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non- tar get” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_625848],  and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progr ession/recurrence (taking as  reference f or progressive dise ase the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatmen t started). The participant's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

6.3.[ADDRESS_833862].[ 98] 
Using iRECIST criteria the following  will be incorporat ed into the assessment: 
• An increase in the sum of target les ions of more than 20%, unequivocal increase in the 
non-target lesions or new lesions result in iUPD (unconfirmed progression disease); 
iUPD can be assigned multiple ties as long  as iCPD (confirmed  progress ive disease) is 
not confirmed at the next assessment.  
•  Progression is confirmed in the target lesion category if the next imaging assessment 
afte
r iUPD (4 -8 weeks later) confirms a furthe r increase in sum of measures of target 
disease from iUPD, with an i ncrease of at least 5mm. Progression is confirme d in the 
non-target lesion category if subsequent imaging, done every 4 -8 weeks after iUPD 
shows a further unequivocal increase in non- targe t lesions. Progression is confirmed in 
the new lesions category if a t next assessment additional new lesions appear or an 
increase in the size of previously seen new lesions is seen ( >5 mm for sum of new target 
lesion).  
However , the criteria for iCPD (aft er iUP D) are not considered to have been  met if complete 
response, par tial response or stable disease criteria (comp ared with baseline and as defined by 
[CONTACT_393] 1.1) are met at the next assessment after iUPD. The status is reset (unlike RECIST 1.1, 
in which a ny progression precludes later complete response, partial  response, or stable  disease). 
iCR, iPR, or iSD should then be assigned; and if no change is detected, then the timepoint response is iUPD.

8.1.[ADDRESS_833869] (A ESI) 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one  of scient ific and medical  interest specif ic to 
understanding of the Investigational Product(s) and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communicat ion by [CONTACT_68477]. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs as sessed as severe a llows  ongoing surveil lance of these events to 
characterize and understand them in association with the use of th ese inves tigatio nal products.  
Only AESIs that match the definition of SAE will be reported within 7 days from the knowledge 
of ev ent. Other non- SAE AESIs do not need to be reported to OSRO but only collected in the 
clinical d atabase. 
The adverse ev ents re lated to mu cosal  bleeding, regardless of site , will be collected as an AESI 
to enable evaluation of pote ntial risk factors,  such  as si te/past radiation/associated in fection at 
site/recent instrumentation and other variables su ch as time to onset, ex posure history, gr ade o f

investigator s to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investi gator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_833875] annually in a summ ary format.  
8.8 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION  REPORTING  
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non- compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol- specific pr ocedural requirem ents on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.  
It is the responsibility of the study Sta ff to documen t any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_83943] (PDTS) online 
applic ation. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements.   
In additi on, any deviati on to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing  IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol 
deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integ rated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 
Compliance with Protocol; 5. 18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations. 
9 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure : 
• that the rights of the participants are protected ; 
• that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Pra ctice and 
standard operating procedures; and 
• the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.   
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_625905] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contrac tor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standa rds, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Adden dum to ICH E6(R1) Marc h 2018, and a pplicable 
regulatory r equirement s. 
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
103 Details of clinical site monitoring will be documen ted in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_85119] O. CMPs will b e protocol -specific, risk -based and tailored to address human 
subject protections a nd integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the int ensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expe cted enrollmen t rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP  to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A  change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non- compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.  
OSRO  SROS  Monitoring visits and related activities will be cond ucted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol . The first activity is before the study start s to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) (IMVs), and a study Close- Out Vi sit (COV).  
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely,  while others will occur at the  study 
site(s). Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action items or follow -up required for resolution of any is sues, discrepancies, or deviatio ns. Monitoring 
reports will be d istributed to the study PI, NCI  CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, 
coordinating center (if applicable), and the Sponsor regulatory file.  
The site Monitor will inform the stu dy team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. 
If unresolved, the M onitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR 
Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting to the Sponsor and as applicable per institutional and  IRB guidance.

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 S
TATISTICAL HYPOT HESIS  
Primary Objectiv es: 
• Arm 1  (Sequ e ntial Dose Escalatio n):  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent SX-682. 
 To determine the MTD of SX -682 followed by M7824 a nd CV301  in partic ipant s 
with advanced or metastat ic solid tumors. If the MTD is not reached t he study 
will b e focused to describe the sa fety and tolerability of SX -682 followed by 
M7824 and CV301 . 
• Arm 2  (Combi nat ion Dose Escalation):  
 To determine th e RP2D of SX -[ADDRESS_833876] udy will be 
focused to describe the safety and tolerability of the drug combination. 
• Arm 3  (Expansion): 
 To evaluate pre liminary effica cy based on Objec tive Response Rate (ORR), in 
each disease cohort separately.  
Secondar y Objectives:  
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
104 • Arms 1 and 2 (Dose Esc alati ons):  
 To characterize the PK/PD profile of SX -682 as a single agent and in 
combinatio n. 
• All Arms:  
 To evaluate pr eliminary effic acy: Disease cont rol rate (DCR) and Progression -
free survival (PFS) using RECIST1.1  
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETER MINATION  
The trial wi ll begin with two phase I evaluations (Cohort 1, Arms 1 and 2; Dose Escalation) as 
follows: initially participan ts will be enrolled in  Arm 1 involving monother apy with SX -682 
followed  by M7824 + CV301. This will i nitially includ e up to 3 dose levels, with 3 participant s 
per dose level if no DLTs are experienced. However, if in any of the dose levels, a DLT is  
identified in the 3 particip ants, 3 more part icipant s will be enr olled in tha t dose le vel, with 
subsequent escalation only if there are <=[ADDRESS_833877] 
3 dose levels, escalation will con tinue to DL4 an d 5 using the above  3+[ADDRESS_833878] 3 dose leve ls, then participant s will be enrolled to Arm 2 . As a resu lt, 
depending on toxicities identified, between 9 and 30 participant s may be tr eated within this 
sequential  dose escalation arm .  
In Arm 2, a combination arm with SX -682 followed by [CONTACT_625906] (SX -682, M7824, 
CV301 ), up to [ADDRESS_833879] 3+3 design, up to 5x6=30 
participa nts may be included in this arm. Thus, up to 30+30=60 tot al participants may be treated 
in the phase I portion (Cohort 1, Arms 1 and 2) of the trial.  
The phase II evaluati on (Arm 3) will take place separately in two cohorts:  
TNBC:  
Based on prior studies  [70-72] , the clinical response r ate fo r simila r participant s with advanced  
disease receivi ng a single agent checkpoint inhibitor is expected to be 8 -10%. Thus, an obs erved 
response ra te of a pproximately 15% or higher would be desir able.  
In Arm 3, Cohort 2 (TNBC), the trial will be conduc te d using a Si mon minimax two -stage phase 
II trial design [ 99] t o rule out a n unac ceptably low response ra te (CR+PR) of 5% (p0=0.05) i n 
favor of an improved response rate of 20% ( p1=0.20). With al fa=0.10 (probability of accepting a 
poor treatment=0.10) and beta =  0.20 (probabil ity of rejecting a good treatment=0.20), t he first 
stage will enroll [ADDRESS_833880] been treated in that 
cohort. As it may tak e up to several months to determine if a participant  has experienced a 
response, a temporary pause in the accrual may be  necessary to ensure that enrollment to the 
secon d stage is warranted. If there are 1 -2 participant s with a response out of 21 participa nts in 
this cohort, this would be an uninterestingly low response rate. If there  were 3 or more  of 21 
(14.3%) who experi enced a response,  this would be sufficiently inte resting to warrant further 
study in later trials. Under the null hypothes is (5 % respons e rate), the probability of early 
termination is 54.0%.  
HPV negative HNSCC:  
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
105 Based on prior stud ies [82, 87, 88], the clinical response rate for si milar participant s with this 
disease is expected t o be 13- 18%. Thus, an observed r esponse rate of greater than 25% would be 
desirable.  
In Arm 3, Cohort 3 ( HP V negative H NSCC) , the trial will be conducted using a Simon minimax 
two-stage phase II trial design [99] to rule out an unacceptably low  response rate (CR+PR)  of 
15% (p0=0.15) in favor of an improved response ra te of 40%  (p1=0.40). With 
alfa=0.10(proba bility of accepting a poor treatment=0.10) and beta = 0.20 (probability of 
rejecting a good treatmen t=0.20), the first sta ge will enroll [ADDRESS_833881] been treated in that cohort. As it may take up to seve ral months to 
determine if a pa rticipant has experienced a response, a tempor ary pause in the accrual may be 
necessary to ensure that enrollment t o the second stage is warranted. I f there are 2 -4 participants 
with a response ou t of 16 participants in this cohort, this would be an uninterestingly low 
response rate. If there were 5 o r more of 16 (31.3%) who experie nced a response , this would be 
sufficiently interesting to warrant furthe r stud y in lat er trials. Under the nul l hypothesis (15% 
response rate), the probability of early termination is 60.0%. 
It is expected that up to 1.5 ye ars may  be required to enroll up  to 60 participant s in Arms 1  and 2. 
It is then e xpected that 2- 3 years may be required  to complete accr ual to  Arm 3 . Thus, accrual is 
expected to be completed in 4- 5 years. The total number of evaluable participant s is no m ore 
than 60+21+16=97. To al low for a small number of inevalua ble participant s, the accrual ceiling 
for treated participants in the dose escalation and expansion cohorts  combined will be set at 105 
participant s 
10.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
Intention to treat: a ny subj ects who enroll onto the trial and provide consent and who receive at 
least [ADDRESS_833882] one cycle (defined as 28 days) of SX -682, 
M7824, and  CV301  will be included in safety  evaluations as well as effic acy evaluations for the 
appropriate cohort.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_833883] ≥85 percent of SX -682 sc heduled 
doses were taken and 100% of schedul ed doses of M7 [ADDRESS_833884] their response classified according to the defi nitions in 
section 6.3). (Note: Participants who receive at least treatment cycle and exhibit objective  
disease progression prior to the first restaging will also be considered evaluable.)

assessment is based on the presence, absence,  or unequi vocal progression of the lesions.  
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
10.4.1 General Approach  
Following a determination of saf ety, tolerability, and the MTD in Arms 1 and 2, the f raction of 
participant s who experienc e a response in each disease-spe cific cohort of Arm 3 w ill be  reported 
along with confidence intervals. 
10.4.2 Analysis of the  Primary Endpoints  
The toxicity grades per participant will  be tabulated and repo rted by [CONTACT_625907] (Arms 1 and 2) . This will also include separate evaluations for the initi al monotherapy 
evaluations preceding the evalu ation of the combination at each dose level.  
In Arm 3, the fraction of participant s who  expe rience a resp onse in each disease -specific cohort  
will be reported along with 95% two-side d confidence intervals.  
10.4.3 Analy sis of the Secondary Endpoint(s) 
10.4.4 PK evaluati ons will be performed on participant s in both dose escalation Arms (bo th for 
single ag ent SX -682 and the combination of agents); results will be report ed using 
standard descriptive statistics. In Arm 3, separatel y by [CONTACT_9084], the disease control rate 
(DCR; CR+PR+SD) will  be reported as the fraction of participant s who experience this 
outcome, along with a 95% two -sided confidence interval for eac h fractio n. Progression 
free survival (PFS) will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method, including 
progressions or death without progression as events. Participants who come off study for 
reasons other than progression and choose not to participate in  optional imaging will be 
censored  in dat a analysis at the time when t hey become unfollowable for P FS.  
 
10.4.5 Safety Analyses  
The fra ction of  part icipan ts who experience a toxicity, by [CONTACT_625908], will be 
tabulated per dose level (both single agent and c ombination of agents) during the  Arms [ADDRESS_833886] be en treat ed in the appropriate cohort will be noted and will be used to 
determine if enrollment to the second stage of accrual may proceed for tha t cohort.

12.4 RISK/BENE FIT ASSESSMENT FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS  
12.4.1 Known Potential Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Risks 
Ris
ks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed in the 
Consent Document or sections [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol d ocument. Frequent 
monitoring for adverse effects will help  to minimize the risks associat ed with  admin istration  of 
the study agents . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Bi opsy  
All car e wil l be taken t o minimize risks that may be incurred by  [CONTACT_625909] g. However, there 
are procedur e-related risks (such as bleeding, infection and visceral injury) that will be e xplained 
fully during informed consent.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of local anesthes ia and/or light sedation. 
Biopsies will be done under local anesthesi a an d/or light sedation. Potential side effe cts 
of sedation include headache, nausea and drowsiness. T hese side effects usually go aw ay 
quickly. 
Abbreviated T itle: STAT Trial  
Version Date : 08/17/2022 
 
109 [IP_ADDRESS] Risks of c ontrast dye used in CT scans  
There is a chance o f developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a n allergic reaction from the contrast mate rial, whic h ma y cause 
symptoms ranging f rom mild itching or a rash to severe difficulty breathing, shock or rarely, 
death.  The contrast mater ial may a lso cause kidney problems. 
For I V contrast: Poten tial side ef fects in clude discomfort when the contra st material is  injected , 
feeling warm, flush ed, a metallic t aste, or rarely vomiting or nausea.  
For o ral contrast:  Potential side effects includ e vomitin g, nausea, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], bloating, 
constipation or di arrhea after  drinking the contrast. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of exposure t o Ionizing Rad iation  
This research stud y involves up to nine (9) CT scans (C/A/P) and up to three  (3) CT gu ided 
biopsies (optional) collected  for rese arch purposes only. Subjects undergoing thes e scans and  
optional  biopsies collec tion will be exposed up to 12.[ADDRESS_833889] scans that particip ant will get in this study will expose them to the roughly the same 
amount of radiation as 41 years of  background radiation. The risk of gettin g cancer fr om the  
radiation e xpos ure in th is stud y is 1.2 out of 100 (1.2 %) and of  getting a fatal cancer is 0. 6 out of 
100 (0.6 %)  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Risks of MRI  
People are at risk for injury from the  MRI magnet  if they have some kinds of  metal in their body.  
It may be unsafe to h ave an MRI scan for participants with  pacemakers or other  implanted 
electri cal devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips 
on the wall of a large  artery), metal prostheses (including metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_32284], heart val ves, and 
cochlear  implants), permanent eyeliner, tattoos,  an implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel 
fragments. Welders and metal workers may have small metal fragments in the eye.  
People with fear of conf ined spaces may become anxious during an MRI. Those w ith back 
problems may have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner.  The noise from the 
scanner is loud enough to damage hearing, especially in people who already have hearing loss.  There are no known long- term risks of MRI scans.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Risks of Gadolinium 
The risks of an IV catheter include bleeding, infe ction, or infl amma tion of the skin and vein with 
pain and swelling.   Mild symptoms from gadolinium infusion occ ur in fewer than 1% of those who r eceive it  and 
usually go away quickly.  M ild symptoms  may include cold ness in the arm during the injection, a 
meta llic taste , headache, and nausea.  In an  extremely small number, fewer than one in 300,[ADDRESS_833890] called 
“nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)”.  This condition always involves the skin and can also involve the mus cles, joints and in ternal organs.  N SF has resul ted in a very small number of 
deaths.

Version Date : 08/17/[ADDRESS_833891] drugs  that are less likely to remain in the body will be used on this study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Research  Blood Collection Risks 
Risks of blood draws include  pain and brui sing in the area where the needle is placed, 
lightheadedness, and rarely, fainti ng and inf ection . When large amounts of blood are collected, 
low red blood cell count (anemia ) can develop.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Rapid Progression  
Three large studies of bintrafu sp alfa were r ecently stopped when the drug 
manuf acturer  reviewed data that suggested that the studies would not be likely to prove the study 
treatment better than standard treatments . This data also suggested th at there may be a portion of 
patients that h ave either no benefit from bintrafusp alfa, or that bintrafusp alfa will make the 
tumor grow faster. This has been described with other immuno therapy approaches also with 
studies sugg esting this happens in about 15% of cases.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other R
isks 
Risks include the  possible occu rrence of any of a range  of side effects which are listed in the 
Cons ent Document or this protocol document. Frequent mo nitoring for adve rse effects will help 
to minimiz e the risks associated with administrati on of the study agents.

into the  protocol through the means of inclusio n/exclusion cr iteria, monitoring  strategies,  and 
management guidelines. Overall, the potential benefit of the st udy therapy i n subje cts with solid 
tumors outweigh the risks associated with this drug.  
The potential bene fit to a participant that pa rticipates in thi s study is better control  of their tumor 
growth and disease recurrence which  may or may not have a  favorable impa ct on sym ptoms 
and/or survival. 
Potential adverse reactions attributable  to the ad ministra tion of the study drug utilized in this trial

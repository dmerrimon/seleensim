3. Abstract:  
Although compelling evidence exists that high doses of mother’s own breast milk (mother’s own milk; MOM) 
improves infant health, breast pump dependent ( need to use a breast pump to obtain milk for infants too ill or 
preterm to breastfeed) mothers of critically ill infants often provide  insufficient amounts of MOM to support these 
benefits . Insufficient MOM  has its origins during the first 14 days  postpart um, a critical window that includes 
secretory activation (SA ; milk coming in ; lactogenesis II) and the achievement of coming to volume (CTV; 
providing  500 mLs/day of MOM  by [CONTACT_4475] 14  postpartum ). For all lactating mothers, SA must be achieved for 
lactation to continue, and achievement of CTV predicts provision of MOM through to neonatal intensive care unit 
(NICU)  discharge in preterm very low birthweight (VLBW; <1500 g birthweight)  infants. For this study, we posit 
that alte rnate breast pump suction patterns ( BPSP; suction rate, intensity, and rhythm ) may facilitate achievement 
of CTV in mothers who have achieved SA, but whose daily pumped MOM volumes indicate a high risk of not 
achieving CTV. Therefore, the overall objective  of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of three 
different breast pump suction patterns on lactation outcomes , including achievement of SA,  among pump 
dependent mothers of critically ill infants who demonstrate faltering lactation after ach ievement of SA.  At 6-[ADDRESS_1142176] achieved SA, but demonstrate 
faltering lactation (<350 mLs/day pumped MOM volume) , will be randomized to use one of three different BPSPs  
with two groups having alternative BPSPs and one group using the  current practice  standard  for 7 days . Study 
outcomes will include the following; (1) pumped milk volume, (2) secondary lactation outcomes ( whether or not 
mothers achieve CTV by [CONTACT_4475] 14 -15 postpartum , maintenance of secretory activation,  MOM  removal efficiency, 
and lactation duration); (3) maternal perceptions of comfort, effectiveness, efficiency, and convenience  of the 
BPSPs , and (4) proportion of feedings consisting of MOM consumed by [CONTACT_211046] . Two ex ploratory aims will 
explore potential benefits of the [ADDRESS_1142177] the above -mentioned  lactation outcomes and whether mothers at risk of suboptimal lactation who 
use an alternate BPSP achieve the same lactation outcomes  as do mothers who do not demonstrate faltering 
lactation.   
 
4. Background  
Consumption of High Doses of MOM Reduces Potentially -Preventable Complications:  A key approach to 
reduce complications in critically ill infants is ensuring they  receive high doses of their mother’s own breast 
milk (mother’s own milk; MOM) until neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge . Research repeatedly 
shows infants benefit immensely from consumption of high doses of MOM including decreased risk of short 
and long -term morbidities such as late onset sepsis,[ADDRESS_1142178] Pump -Dependent Mothers of Critically Ill 
Infants : The first 14 days postpartum is a critical window for all lactating mothers because the mammary gland 
undergoes multiple “once -in-a-lifetime” biologic changes that are necessary for continued la ctation, with 
removed MOM volume increasing from [ADDRESS_1142179] pump -dependency, meaning that the pump rather than the infant removes 
MOM and regulates continued lactation. Thus, these mothers are often unable to provide adequate MOM 
volume for infant feedings, compromising infant health. In particular, lack of achievement of CTV is the 
primary predictor of no MOM feeding at NICU discharge, and the window between achievement of SA (on 
average day 5.[ADDRESS_1142180] pump -dependent mothers of preterm infants) and achievement of CTV on 
day [ADDRESS_1142181] pump, BPSPs , and mothers’ use of the pump are 
modifiable factors that can potentially improve the achievement of  CTV and subsequent longer -term lactation 
outcomes. In particular, during the transition from the endocrine (SA) to autocrine control of lactation, frequent 
and effective/efficient MOM removal is key to optimizing prolactin release from the brain, as well as leveraging 
the multiple autocrine and paracrine mechanisms that control continued MOM synthesis and release. Thus, 
modification of BPSPs that may optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of MOM removal between 
achievement of SA and CTV represents a pro mising “next step” intervention in this at -risk population.  
 
The Role of Alternate BPSPs . Because critically ill infants admitted to the NICU are physiologically unable to 
fully feed directly at the breast, mothers are completely breast pump -dependent, mea ning that they must use a 
breast pump to obtain MOM for their infant .  Furthermore, in completely breast pump -dependent mothers, the 
pump rather than the infant regulates lactation processes, including suckling -induced prolactin release and the 
autocrine -paracrine mechanisms of “supply and demand”. Thus, the pump must do more than just “get the 
MOM out ” if lactation is to continue via these endocrine and autocrine mechanisms. Central to this concept is 
that the BPSP should mimic the healthy term infant duri ng breastfeeding to the extent possible  so that breast 
pump -dependent mothers receive mammary signaling that optimizes MOM synthesis and release. Previous 
studies reveal that the human infant uses species -specific sucking patterns during the early postpart um period as 
MOM volume is established. A member of this study team (PPM)  partnered with Medela in [ADDRESS_1142182] pump -dependent 
mothers.11 This initiation  BPSP  is now embe dded in Medela pumps throughout the world for use in the 
maternity setting, with instructions to use this BPSP  (Plus)  until the achievement of SA, then to switch to a 
Symphony plus 2-phase pattern which is a “one size fits all” approach to MOM removal.  
 
BPSPs [ADDRESS_1142183] pump -dependent mothers by [CONTACT_823763] “one size fits all” approach of using th e standard care Symphony Plus B PSP after achievement of SA.  
Eligible mothers will have demonstrate d faltering lactation (<350 mLs/day pumped MOM  on postpartum day 6-
8) after achievement of SA.  Both BPSP 1 (slower rate with a long hold time and higher starting vacuum 
pressure) and BPSP 2  (faster rate with longer hold time during peak vacuum pressures)  have been trialed in 
mothers of preterm infants, but not during this early postpartum time period  nor with m others who experience 
faltering lactation .  Although different in the manner in which suction is applied and maintained during each 
pump cycle, both BPSPs have greater area under the suction curve (accomplished via modifications in suction 
pressure and dur ation) than does the standard Symphony Plus  BPSP. Theoretically, these BPSPs afford “more 
time” per cycle for MOM removal, and may optimize endocrine and autocrine regulation of lactation , 
increasing MOM synthesis. These outcomes are reflected in the speci fic aims. An additional interest is whether 
these alternative BPSPs may be especially effective and/or efficient in mothers with co -morbidities such as 
overweight and obesity, for whom the extra area under the suction curve may improve MOM removal.   
Howeve r, equally important is maternal perceptions of comfort and ease of use for both BPSPs, especially 
during the early postpartum period when the mammary tissues are more prone to discomfort with either 
breastfeeding or breast pump use.

5. Specific Aims:   
The primary purpose  of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of three different BPSPs [BPSP1, 
BPSP2, and Symphony Plus (Standard Care )] on lactation outcomes among pump dependent mothers  of 
critically ill infants with faltering lactation.    
Specific aims  are as follows:  
 
Aim 1 : Compare the clinical effectiveness of 3 different BPSPs  on pumped milk volume during Days 8 -15 
postpartum.  
 
Aim 2: Compare lactation outcomes  for the three groups, including 1) m aintenance of SA through to 
postpartum day 14 -15, 2) rate of increase in daily pumped MOM  volume , 3) whether or not mothers achieve 
CTV by [CONTACT_4475] 14 -15 postpartum , 4) cumulative pumped MOM  volume over days 1 -7 and 8 -15) MOM  removal 
efficiency, and 5 ) lactation duration .  
 
Aim 3:  Compare m aternal perceptions  of comfort, effectiveness, efficiency , and convenience of the 3 BPSPs .  
 
Aim 4: Compare infant outcomes for the including: 1) proportion  of feedings consisting of MOM during the 
NICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 2) proportion discharged  consuming any MOM , and 3) proportion receiving MOM at 3 
and 6 months of life .  
 
Exploratory Aim 1: Explore potential benefits of the [ADDRESS_1142184] lactation outcomes  (high BMI/obesity, diabetes, pregnancy induced 
hypertension).  
 
Exploratory Aim 2: Explore whether mothers categorized as having faltering lactation on postpartum day 6-8 
and who use BPSP1 , BPSP2 , or Symphony Plus BPSP (Standard Care)  achieve the same lactation outcomes 
(Aims 1, 2, 4) as do mothers who do not demonstrate faltering lactation at postpartum day 6-8. 
 
6. Research Plan:   
 
This study will use a randomized control trial design with 3 arms to compare the clinical effectiveness of three 
differen t BPSP s on lactation outcomes among pump dependent mothers of critically ill infants who demonstrate 
faltering lactation on day 6-8 postpartum . Mothers identified as having faltering  lactation will be randomly 
assigned to  one of 3 groups; ( 1) BPSP1 , (2) BPSP 2 , and (3) Symphony Plus BPSP  (Standard Care) .  
 
Sample and Setting:   
 
Up to 274, racially and economically diverse mothers  and infants(s)  who have delivered a critically ill infant (s) 
admitted to the NICU will be sampled from the obstetrical unit at UFHealth Shands Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823736] a Level IV (72 bed) NICU.  
 
Inclusion criteria  are: 1) > 18 years of age, 2) delivered infant (s) of any GA admitted to the NICU  including 
mom of multiples , 3) intent to provide exclusive MOM to their infants for the first 14 days, 4 ) expected to be 
breast pump -dependent for at least 14 days , and  5) English speaking.

 Exclusion criteria  are: 1) breast reduction or augmentation, 2) infant not expected to  survive, 3) m edications or 
maternal conditions incompatible with providing MOM for a NICU infant , and (4) resides over 60 miles from 
UFHealth . 
 
The NICU at UF Shands admits infants that are racially diverse regardless of private or Medicaid insurance 
coverage.  All mom that meets the above criteria wou ld be eligible for enrollment. Informed consent will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_229010] s in their postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823737] 48 
hours postpartum . The informed consent includes  mother’s  permission to access their infant ’s chart to collect 
information  up until infant’s discharge.  The i nfant has no study interventions . In the rare instance that an infant 
breastfeeds, intake will be determined through test weighting (infant weight pre and post breastfeeding). Prior to

provides prompts for education discussion and video links about pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_417121], breast and nipple 
assessment, breast shield sizing and comfort.  (Appendix F). A daily sample of  0.3 mL of pumped MOM  (if 
mother has pumped at least 5mL/day)  will be  tested for MOM sodium level as an indicator of secretory 
activation . At day  6-[ADDRESS_1142187] (1) achieved secretory 
activation  (change from small volumes of colostrum to large volumes of more mature milk ; determined by a 
milk sodium level < 20 mM ) and (2) ha ve a pumped milk volume < 350 mL/d . Mothers who are identified as 
being not at risk for suboptimal lactation (have achieved secretory activation and their pumped milk volume is > 
350mL/d ) will not be randomized  but will continue with standard care regardin g BPSPs , and continue to have 
data regarding lactation collected. Mothers who do not reach SA, determined by  a milk sodium level > [ADDRESS_1142188] pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_823740] a

Research Procedures and Analyses by [CONTACT_45438].  
 
Aim 1 : The primary aim of this study  is to compare the clinical effect iveness  of [ADDRESS_1142193] pump (Medela Symphony Plus) while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823743] (standard policy). Upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], all mothers will be provided the 
same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823744] h ome use. At 6-8 days postpartum, those m others who undergo 
randomization , will be provided a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823745] (Medela, A G, Switzerland)  as a substitute for 
the standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823746]. The SMART pump  (the same  breast  pump  used as standard care ) has been 
adapted to electronically measure, record and store both pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_823747] 
(measured ± 0.1g; 1 g=1 mL). A card will be inserted into the SMART pump which will program the pump to 
either use BPSP1, BPS P 2, or Standard Plus) . Mothers will be blinded to the BPSP used. Information is stored 
and the embedded computer chip is downloadable into a customized computer program (on a secure College of 
Nursing computer) at the termination of data collection. A SMA RT pump with the same randomized pattern 
will also be placed at their infant’s bedside in the NICU to facilitate pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_823748]. Mothers will be 
provided a key tag  to use prior to using the SMART pump  to ensure only her pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_823749] o n 
the embedded computer chip. All mothers will be assisted to obtain a permanent breast pump for  home  use after 
study completion as per usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422]. Mothers that have been withdrawn from the study, at week 1, for 
not reaching SA, will be allowed to  use the Medela Symphony Plus for 2 -weeks, as needed.  
Pumped milk volume will be measured daily  using  the following  two method ;   
(1) Mothers will weigh each bottle of MOM  using the SMART pump and this information will be recorded 
and stored (only those mothers who are randomized and only from day 8 -15). 
 
(2) All m others will be provided pre -weighed and labeled vials to place their MOM  following each 
expression per NICU policy and asked to bring all expressed MOM  to the NICU. It is standard care in 
this NICU that all MOM brought to the NICU is weighed and the volume recorded in the infant’s EMR  
(all mothers) . Volume of  pumped MOM  will be determined by [CONTACT_8497] (1 mL = 1 gram). All  MOM will 
be weighed by [CONTACT_823765]’s designated Human Milk Room 
since 2013, are not involved with direct care of either mother or infant and will be blinded to the group 
assignments. There are currently 7 human milk  technicians covering the Human Milk Room 24/7 who 
7 
 weigh and log each container of MOM delivered to the NICU. After MOM is weighed, it is available for 
infant consumption. Measurement of MOM volume (through weighing) will occur daily for [ADDRESS_1142194] weighing or weighing infants prior to and following 
breastfeeding, is an accurate method of determining intake during breastfe eding.12 Prior to each 
breastfeeding session, infants will be weighed. Weight will include clothing, diap er, and blankets worn 
by [CONTACT_58076]. Following breastfeeding, the infant will be weighed again, clad in the same clothing on a 
Baby [CONTACT_823766] (Medela, Inc., McHenry, Ill) to the nearest 0.2g. Differences between pre - and post -
feeding weights will be reco rded in the infant’s EMR and added to the total volume the mother 
expressed on that day.   
  
Aim 2: A second aim will c ompare lactation outcomes including 1) maintenance of secretory activation, 2) rate 
of increase in daily pumped MOM  volume, 3) whether or not mothers reach coming to volume (CTV; pumped 
milk volume of > 500 mL by [CONTACT_4475] 14 postpartum). daily pumped MOM  volume, 4) cumulative MOM  volume 
over days 1 -7 and 8 -15) milk removal efficiency, and 5) lactation duration.  
 
Maintenance of secretory activation . For all mothers enrolled in the study, m aintenance  
of secretory activation will be defined as a daily MOM  sodium level  < 20mM.[ADDRESS_1142195] the sample onto the sensor of an ion selective electrode analyze r 
(HORIBA, Japan) which is a hand -held machine used for sodium  and potassium  analysis (see photo), has been 
validated for accurate analysis of human milk sodium and potassium levels, and will be calibrated prior to every 
analysis.[ADDRESS_1142196] been reported between the ability of sodium alone versus a Na:K ratio to predict 
pumped milk volume, we will also measure potassium levels.16 (Appendix H) To ensure accuracy, individuals 
performing sodium analysis will be trained and evaluated prior to beginning analysis and quarterly. Our team is 
highly skilled in milk collection, processing and analysis.13,17 
 
Rate of increase in daily pumped MOM  volume , achievement of secretory activation (Yes/N o), and 
cumulative MOM  volume  over days 1 -7 and 8 -15 postpartum . MOM volume will be measured as  discussed 
in Aim 1  and each of the outcomes determined.    
 
Milk removal efficiency . Efficiency of milk removal  will be determined by [CONTACT_823767][INVESTIGATOR_007] ( cumulative per day and cumulative over days 8 -15). Minutes of pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_823750]  (Appendix M). 
 
Lactation Duration. Number of days a mother lactates (either via breastfeeding or expressing MOM) during 
her infant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823751]. Mothers will 
be determined to have ceased lactation when they are  no longer bringing MOM  to the NICU, are not placing the 
infant to breast for nutritive or non -nutritive sucking, and states they are  no longer lactating when questioned. If 
still lactating at their infant’s NICU discharge, mothers in all groups will be ques tioned regarding their 
continued lactation through monthly text message hyperlinked surveys via the Qualtrics platform until their 
infant is [ADDRESS_1142197] m onth she discontinued lactating  (Appendix J) . 
 
Aim 3:  Will c ompare maternal perceptions of comfort, effectiveness, efficiency, and convenience of the [ADDRESS_1142198] pump patterns.  

8 
 Mother’ s perception  regarding the comfort, rhythm, effectiveness, and ease of use of the three BPSPs  will be 
assessed via a text message hyperlinked Qualtrics survey within 7 days of study completion . A reminder will b e 
sent if no response in 7 days  (Appendix K).  
 
Aim 4:  A fourth aim will  compare proportion of feedings consisting of MOM consumed by [CONTACT_823768] 
[ADDRESS_1142199] 15 days and p roportion 
of total feeds consisting of MOM consumed during the 24 hours prior to discharge will be recorded from the 
infant’s EMR. Proportion of feeds that include MOM after discharge will be determined until the mother ceases 
lactation or the infant is  [ADDRESS_1142200] 24 -hours that consisted of MOM (either direct breastfeeding or 
feeding expressed MOM).  
 
Exploratory Aim 1 : Will e xplore potential benefits of the three BPSPs  on the lactation outcomes  in Aim [ADDRESS_1142201] lactation outcomes (high BMI/obesity, diabetes, 
pregnancy induced hypertension ).18 A subset of mothers diagnosed with high BMI/obesity, diabetes, and /or 
pregnancy induced hypertension will be classified as having 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_1142202] 
lactation outcomes. Potential benefits of the three BPSPs  will be ex plored in this subset of mothers.  
 
Exploratory Aim 2 : Explore whether mothers identified as having faltering lactation who use an alternate 
BPSP  (BPSP 1 or 2 ) achieve the same lactation success as mothers identified as not having faltering lactation  
(pumpe d MOM  volume > 350 mL/d by [CONTACT_4475] 6-8). Lactation outcomes (see Aim 1 and 2) will be compared 
between moth ers who were randomized to use either  BPSP [ADDRESS_1142203] pumped MOM  volume in mothers of critically ill 
infants. While control of these variables within the study is impossible, we will carefully document the se factors 
on all enrolled mothers to allow for inclusion in statistical analysis as adjustment variables. See Table 1 for 
additional confounding variables.  
Skin-to-skin care : Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823752] -to-skin care (holding infants dressed in a diaper on their 
mother’s bare chest) will be documented by [CONTACT_823769]’s EMR. Skin to 
skin care has been associated with increased MOM  productio n in observational studies,19 yet the frequency or 
duration needed is not known, and skin -to-skin care may not be possible due to an infant's critical status.[ADDRESS_1142204] during skin -to-skin care and the number and duration of these epi[INVESTIGATOR_71276].  
Lactation Support : Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823753]’s 
EMR. Although lactation support may improve breastfeeding success, limited data exists regarding the effect of 
lactation support in pump dependent mothers of critically ill  infants.21-23 There are 5 (3 FTE) lactation 
specialists providing services to mothers in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823754] s 
expressing MOM for infants in the NICU. Information regarding any l actation support  mothers  receive  outside 
of UF Health will be determined through monthly surveys . If no response within 7 days, a one-time reminder 
will be sent  (Appendix C; Appendix J). 
Maternal Mood . Maternal mood affects breastfeeding success in  healthy  term infants and may impact lactation 
success in mothers of critically ill  infants.24,25 Prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and at 1 5 days postpartum,  all mothers 
will be asked to complete the MAACL -R; a standardized instrument with well -documented psychometric 
properties that assesses mood states by [CONTACT_823770], Depression, 
Hostility, Positive Affect and Sensation Seeking. It consists of 132 adjectives at < an 8th grade reading level, 
[ADDRESS_1142205] access to social workers who work 
in NICU to support all mothers during their infants NICU stay. (Appendi x D and E).

7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:   
It is possible that mothers may find the alternate breast pump patterns uncomfortable.  Should this happen, they 
will be asked if they would like to be withdrawn from the study  and use their own breast pump consistent with 
standard care for all mothers pum pi[INVESTIGATOR_823758] .  
8. Possible Benefits:  
There is no direct benefit to m others completing this study. Moms may possibly benefit from having a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823759] [ADDRESS_1142208]:

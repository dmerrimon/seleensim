[ADDRESS_618518]: Hypnotherapy 
or Pharmacotherapy  
 
Study Goals & Brief Description:  
Goals/Objectives:  
Specific Aim  (1)  Determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is at least as effective and durable in 
treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) as a non -mind/body treatment (pharmacotherapy)  
Hypothesis: Among patients with urgency urinary incontinence, hypnother apy ameliorates abnormal perception 
of bladder distension outside the hypnotic state and thereby [CONTACT_481538] (2)  Determine whether hypnotherap y treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence) is associated 
with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI than that which occurs following 
pharmacotherapy.  
Hypothesis 2.1. Patients with urgency urinary incontinence w ill exhibit increased activation within portions of the 
limbic cortex (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) during bladder distension relative to healthy controls. Patients 
will also exhibit an abnormal pattern of functional connectivity within the limbic  system.  
Hypothesis 2.2.  Among patients with urgency incontinence, hypnotherapy will decrease hyper -activation of the 
limbic cortex in response to bladder distension and/or modulate functional connectivity within the limbic system.  
Moreover, normalizati on of hyper -activation and connectivity will be greater in hypnotherapy compared to 
pharmacotherapy.  
 
Brief Description: Design, Outcome, Interventions, Duration, Sample Size and Population:  
This study includes  
1. A single -blinded, randomized controlled tria l (RCT) based on a non -inferiority design which compares 
hypnotherapy to pharmacotherapy in treating UUI  
 Urge incontinent women (N=152) will be randomized to hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy and 
evaluated at months 2, 6 &12; study duration is thus 1 year. UUI subjects will be stratified for UUI 
severity and fMRI performance.  
 The primary objective will be to compare group change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 2 month follow -up.  
 Secondary objectives will be to compare group change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 6 & 12 months, other  
voiding diary parameters (urinary frequency, pad counts, cure and “durable cure”), and change 
in the OAB -qSF and other questionnaires (see 1.2) at 2, 6 & [ADDRESS_618519] of hypnotherapy and pharmacotherapy on brain function in 
patients with UUI.  
 Up to eighty  women  (of the planned 152)  with UUI will be recruited in order to obtain up to sixty 
analyzable fMRI datasets. Up to 30-35 normative controls will be recruited in order to  achieve  
25-30 analyzable fMRI datasets  from normative controls . fMRI datasets from UUI patients will be 
compared to fMRI datasets from normative controls.  The normative controls will be involved in 
the study for a month or less.  
 In addition, the same , up to 80, UUI subjects will also undergo fMRI analysis after receiving 
treatment (hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy) for two months. Post treatment fMRI results from 
UUI subjects will be compared  to their baseline images.  These UUI subjects will complete the 
fMRI portion of the trial after being “on study” for [ADDRESS_618520] analysis for one year  (See #1 above)  
 Measured outcomes will be differences in ba seline brain activation and connectivity in UUI 
subjects compared to controls as well as differences  in treatment effect on brain activation and 
connectivity in subjects receiving pharmacotherapy compared to those receiving hypnotherapy

1. Study Obje ctives  
 
1.1 Primary Objective:  
1.1.1.  To determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is at least as effective and 
durable in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) as a non -mind/body treatment 
(pharmacotherapy), comparing between group changes in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481477] 2 months based on a non -inferiority design.  
 
1.1.2.  To determine whether hypnotherapy treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence) is 
associated with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on functiona l MRI 
than that which occurs following pharmacotherapy  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives:  
1.2.1  To determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is at least as effective and 
durable, in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) as a non -mind/body treatment 
(pharma cotherapy).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  We will compare differences in UUI “cure” (defined as complete resolution of UUI 
on voiding diaries) separately evaluating 2, 6 and 12 month results (i.e. “cure” at 
2, 6 and 12 months).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  We will also compare between group differences in “durab le cure” (defined as 
complete resolution of UUI on all voiding diaries collected at 2, 6 & 12 months).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  We will compare change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 2, 6 & 12 months evaluating change 
in urinary frequency and pad counts recorded on voiding diaries.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  We will c ompare between group differences in change in questionnaire scores 
(OAB -q SF, ISI, Global questionnaires and PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12 scores) and between group 
differences in the post -treatment Expectation question at 2, 6 & 12 months.  
 
1.2.2  Additionally, we will evaluate the baseline occurrence of concomitant syndromes such as 
irritable bowel and painful bladder syndrome in this population of women with UUI based on 
the medical history, CRADI -8, IBS Module, and IC and VAS pain questionnaires. We will 
explore whether there are differences in bowel or IC symptoms following treatment if there 
are sufficient numbers of women with bowel or IC problems at baseline.  
 
1.2.3  To confirm differences in brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI in UUI subjects 
compared to normative con trols.

  2. Background and Rationale  
2.1 Background  
Urgency urinary incontinence (urgency associated with involuntary urine loss, or UUI)38 affects millions of women 
daily and can impair quality of life more than diabetes. Twice as common in women, urgency incontinence 
increases with age and afflicts 24% of women ≥ 40 years old.16 It is associated with nursing home placement in 
the elderly and its stigma results in social isolation, depression and decreased work productivity in younger 
women.16,41,52,59,69 Urgency incontinence burden will increase as the U.S. population ages and will consume 76 
billion dollars in 2015 and 86 billion dollars by 2020.32 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_481478], medications, a 
cornerstone of treatment, are only 15% m ore effective than placebo with little evidence of durability beyond 12 
weeks.38,54 Medications are poorly tolerated, with compliance as low as 45% at 1 month and 13% at [ADDRESS_618521] of chronic drug therapy.54 In 
2000, the U.S. spent $1.[ADDRESS_618522] at risk for incontinence, those older than 65, increases an additional 21% by 2015.  
 
While pharma cotherapy of urgency incontinence has focused the diminishing motor innervation of the bladder 
by [CONTACT_481539], new paradigms point to the alternative of focusing 
treatment on the brain. Treatment based on recognition o f urgency incontinence as a functional disorder provides 
an alternative to continued costly reliance on pharmacotherapy. Current knowledge suggests UUI pathogenesis 
is similar to other functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and fibromy algia. Advances in 
brain imaging suggest that increased perceptual awareness, or hyper -vigilance, is likely the cause of functional 
disorders.6,45,74 Specifically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain has shown that women with urgency 
incontinence  manifest abnormal activation of the limbic cortex, the portion of the brain that integrates emotional 
context with stimuli arising within the body (interoception).20,27,33.36,71 Connectivity between the limbic cortex and 
other portions of the brain may also be altered in patients with urgency incontinence. No urgency incontinence 
treatment has specifically targeted brain activation and connectivity as a means of controlling sympt oms nor has 
any attempt been made to assess changes in abnormal brain activation or connectivity following treatment. The 
effects of mind/body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481479].[ADDRESS_618523] work to assess whether mind/body therapy of a functional disorder is accompanied 
by [CONTACT_481540]. Hypnotherapy, a mind/body therapy that can be administered in a 
standardized and reproducible fashion, is the best candidat e for assessing these changes.  
 
Hypnosis can profoundly alter sensory awareness and cognitive processing in response to external stimuli.24 It 
promotes “dissociation from painful experience and distress via hypnotic induction” and modulates activation of 
the limbic cortex in response to pain and conflict resolution.[ADDRESS_618524] characterized in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional 
gastrointestinal disorder closely analogous to urgency incontinence.34,[ADDRESS_618525] as  
effective in treating UUI as current pharmacologic therapy. Our central hypothesis is that hypnotherapy can be 
used to modulate neurologic interactions between the brain and bladder, providing effective UUI treatment. 
Recent work using functional magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain has better delineated the abnormal 
neurologic interactions that could be targeted for treatment of UUI, specifically, the accentuated neural responses 
to afferent signals from visceral organs that are the basis for hyp er-vigilance.6,12,23 Mind/body, specifically 
hypnotherapy, treatment of UUI offers the hope of targeting this hyper -vigilance and redirecting focus of UUI 
treatment to the brain. Hypnotherapy has successfully treated other functional disorders.6 One case s eries and 
our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_481480] a well -tolerated, effective treatment 
for UUI.29  Neurophysiologic models link the effects of hypnotherapy to altered activation of the limbic (emotional) 
brain and its c onnections with the executive control portions of the brain.25,[ADDRESS_618526] 
attention and offers the means to counterbalance the effects of hyper -vigilance.26  The rationale  for our proposal 
is based on this prior work which has shown that brain activation is abnormal in subjects with UUI, that UUI may 
respond to hypnotherapy, and that hypnotherapy targets these sites of abnormal brain activation. Proof that 
hypnotherapy provides durable relief from UUI would change the focus of UUI tre atment and would demonstrate 
    
11 
  the physiologic basis for the use of a mind/body therapy to treat UUI, a functional disorder that affects a large 
segment of the population. We will test our central hypothesis with the study goals described previously.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_618527]: Specific Aim 1) Pharmacotherapy for urgency incontinence targets bladder receptors. It has had 
uneven  therapeutic success due to side effects that have deterred long term use.24,66,[ADDRESS_618528] our  working hypothesis that the central abnormality  in urgency incontinence is an altered perception of 
bladder distension and that hypnotherapy more directly affects this abnormality than medications , resulting in 
greater improvement in urinary urgency and incontinence. Our approach  randomizes women to ac tive 
interventions for 8 weeks; [ADDRESS_618529] anticholinergic medications, long -acting Tolterodine 
or Oxybutynin. Regarding the cho ice of anti -cholinergics, meta -analyses conclude that no one drug has proven 
superior in treating urgency incontinence but that, extended release formulations of medications are more 
effective than immediate release.38  We will compare change in improvemen t in voiding diaries and validated 
questionnaires following both treatments. We will follow subjects at 2 months, then at 6 and 12 months. The 8 
weeks of active interventions will be followed by [CONTACT_481541] -hypnosis and/or hypnosis audiofile 
use or continued medication use for 12 months. The rationale for this aim  is to demonstrate that hypnotherapy 
targeting hyper -vigilance improves urinary continence as well as does pharmacotherapy.  When the studies 
proposed in Aim #[ADDRESS_618530] the focus of incontinence 
treatment towards mind -based therapy and foster additional trials of this therapy for other functional disorders.  
For the fMRI; Specific Aim 2 ): Current knowledge suggests urgency incontinenc e pathogenesis is similar to other 
functional disorders such as IBS, representing a manifestation of “hyper -vigilance” to normal body 
sensations.6,55,[ADDRESS_618531] displayed differences in connectivity between the limbic cortex and sites in the central 
executive network (e.g. prefrontal cortex).45,56,[ADDRESS_618532] monitoring is suppressed by [CONTACT_481542].24,25,53,60 Furthermore, the anterior cingulate 
cortex is not the sole target in the limbic cortex for mind/body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. It appears to be an important nexus for 
acute stimuli but chronic symptoms may be mediated elsewhere.[ADDRESS_618533].  
 
Our working hypothesis  is that among patients with urgency incontinence hypnotherapy causes sustained 
decreases in abnormal evoked activation of the limbic cortex in response to bladder distension and/or 
modulates abnormal intrinsic activity (functional connectivity) in these s ame areas. We also predict that this 
normalization of evoked activation and functional connectivity will be greater than that seen with 
    
[ADDRESS_618534] is sustained outside the hypnotic state 
would be the initial exploration of brain plasticity in response to mind/body therapy. The expected  outcome of 
this innovative proposal would be the first demonstration of the physiologic correlate of successful mind/body 
treatment of a functional disorder.  
 
 
3. Study Design  
Brief Description:  
 
This study includes  
1. A single -blinded, randomized controlle d trial (RCT) based on a non -inferiority design which compares 
hypnotherapy to pharmacotherapy in treating UUI.  
 Urge incontinent women (N=152) will be randomized to hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy and 
evaluated at months 2, 6 &[ADDRESS_618535] which will evaluate up to 80 of these women with UUI.  
 These women will undergo fMRI before treatment and their baseline imaging results will be 
compared to  normative controls.  
 In addition, the  UUI subjects  participating in the fMRI  will undergo imaging after treatment. The 
images of UUI subjects following treatment will be compared to their baseline images.  
 
Outcomes:  
 
Primary Outcomes:  
1. Between group differences in change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481481] 1 at  2 month follow -up 
based on 3 day voiding diaries  
2. Between group differences in change in activation of limbic cortex and brain connectivity following 
treatment  for Specific Aim 2  
Secondary Outcomes:  
1. Between group differences in change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481481] 1 from baseline to follow -up 
at both 6 and 12 months based on 3 day voiding diaries.  
2. Between group differences in change in pad counts, voiding frequency and cure (resolution) of UUI 
on voiding diary for Specific Aim 1 at 2, 6 and 12 month follow -up as well as “durable cu re” 
(resolution of UUI on all follow -up diaries at 2, 6 & 12 months)  
3. Between group differences in the post -treatment expectation question and between group 
differences  in questionnaire change scores (the OAB -qSF, ISI,  PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12, Global questionnaire, 
CRAD I-8, IBS Module, IC questionnaire) for Specific Aim 1 at 2, 6 and 12 month follow -up 
4. Baseline differences in activation of the limbic cortex and brain connectivity in women with UUI 
compared to normative controls for Specific Aim 2  
 
Overview:  
 
Women with UU I who meet inclusion criteria and who choose to participate in the study will be enrolled at the 
University of New Mexico Urogynecology Clinic. We will screen subjects for study entry as we always do 
clinically, based on voiding diaries to ensure that subj ects have UUI (and not other types of incontinence) and 
with a screening questionnaire, the OAB Awareness tool. Subjects will be randomized to treatment with either: 
1) Pharmacotherapy (a standard therapy for UUI) and conventional behavioral therapy or 2) Hypnotherapy and 
conventional behavioral therapy. All subjects will give signed informed consent prior to study treatment. 
Approximately 152 women will be randomized to hypnotherapy or to pharmacotherapy with approximately half 
in each group. UUI subjects will be informed that study participation will be approximately 1 year; Measurements 
will be performed prior to treatment, following completion of treatment visits (treatment visits are performed over 
8 weeks), and again at [ADDRESS_618536] will be performed as an 
intention to treat analysis. A secondary analysis will be performed as a per protocol a nalysis.  
 
A subset of subjects with UUI ( up to 80) in both treatment groups will have brain fMRIs performed at baseline 
and follow -up at the Mind Research Network. In addition, 30-[ADDRESS_618537]:  
A. Randomization to treatment  
Study participants will be randomized to either pharmacotherapy or hypnotherapy groups using a computer -
generated randomization scheme in varying permuted block sizes of 4 -8 which will be stratified for fMRI 
performance and UUI severity (< 4 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481482]. ≥ 4 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_80756] 3 day voiding diaries) to ensure 
relatively equal numbers in both treatment groups. Group assignments will be placed in opaque, sealed 
envelopes by [CONTACT_481543]. The envelopes will be opened and subjects 
will be randomized only after subjects have signed inform ed consent and answered baseline questions and 
questionnaires. Investigators involved in analyzing fMRIs, investigators participating in the RCT, study personnel 
performing data entry and the study statistician will be blinded to knowledge of subjects’ tre atment groups. 
Investigator blinding will only be breached if a subject suffers an unexpected clinical event and investigator 
knowledge of the subject’s treatment is essential to providing standard of care. Subjects cannot be blinded to 
treatment intervent ions as it will be obvious to them whether or not they are undergoing hypnotherapy or taking 
medications.  
 
Visits for Study : (Refer to Flow Diagrams at end of this section)  
 
A. UUI STUDY SUBJECTS:  
Screening: Subjects in the UNMH Urogynecology  clinics with UUI who qualify for study entry will be asked 
whether they are interested in study participation. These subjects will be assured that declining study 
participation will not affect their clinical care. In addition, women with UUI who contact t he UNMH Ob -Gyn 
research division expressing interest in study participation will have the study explained to them and follow the 
same procedures as UNMH subjects (see following). Potential subjects will be given a copy of the study consent 
for their review . Those who are interested will be administered the OAB Awareness tool,18 a validated measure 
which screens for presence of OAB, to screen whether or not they are candidates for the study. They will also 
be instructed how to keep a voiding diary. If they u ltimately choose to participate in the study, they will be asked 
to bring the diary with them for Visit 1 (below). The patient will be given the option to schedule Study Visit [ADDRESS_618538] the study coordinator to schedule Study Visit 1  at a later date if they are uncertain 
regarding study participation.  
 
Visit 1  (At study entry): All subjects; (1) Will return voiding diaries (which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_481544]) & instruction regarding void ing diaries will be reiterated & arrangements 
made for return of future voiding diaries (2) Will be administered the OABq -SF questionnaire,15  the Incontinence 
Severity Index (ISI), and the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC).85 (see questionnai res attached). 
The OABq -SF questionnaire is a condition specific validated questionnaire developed to quantitate OAB 
symptoms and the PPBC is a validated global questionnaire regarding subjects’ impression of the severity of 
their urinary condition.[ADDRESS_618539] reported upon its improvement following 
therap y.67,68,16 (3) Answer demographic questions and questions about their past medical history. Subjects will 
also be administered the Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory 8 (CRADI -8) subscale of the PFDI -20 (which has 
been validated in women with bowel symptoms  and pelvic floor disorders),87 the Rome III IBS Module, and the 
Painful Bladder Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Score (PBIC -SS)86  and Pain Visual Analogue Scale,37 as irritable 
bowel (IBS) and painful bladder (Interstitial Cystitis)  syndromes are associat ed with UUI. IBS and IC may be 
    
[ADDRESS_618540] responded to other UUI treatments  (4) Will have already 
undergone a pelvic examination which includes the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POP -Q) Exam during 
their routin e clinical evaluation within the last year; if they have not, however, they will undergo a POP -Q exam. 
The POP -Q is a validated examination recommended by [CONTACT_481545]’ prolapse9 (5) Subjects will have cystometry scheduled as this is part of clinical care to 
help distinguish between the different types of incontinence. This is a test where subjects have a catheter placed 
in the bladder, the bladder is filled with sterile fluid and bladder volum es at which sensations of urgency and 
desire to void occur are recorded.  Subjects who have undergone formal UDS and whose UDS results are 
available, do not have to have cystometry repeated unless they choose to participate in the fMRI study.  (6) 
Subjects who are willing to undergo fMRI and are free from MRI contraindications will be informed of the 
date/time of the fMRI visit or their contact [CONTACT_52720]. They will be contact[CONTACT_481546]/time before Visit 3 (7) B ehavioral interventions, a standard treatment for urgency incontinence, will be 
discussed with all subjects and a hand -out will be given to all subjects and arrangements for future contact [CONTACT_481547].  
 
Visit 2:  Cystometry will be performed (see #5 above, Visit 1) Cystometry is a test where subjects have a catheter 
placed in their bladder, the bladder is filled with sterile fluid and bladder volumes at which sensations of 
increasing urge to void are recorded. It is part of clinical care to he lp distinguish between the different types of 
incontinence. Subjects will be treated with prophylactic antibiotics the day of  cystometric testing after 
documenting absence of allergies to the antibiotics prescribed. Prior to cystometry the subjects will ha ve a urine 
pregnancy test (if they are premenopausal and have not had a hysterectomy or permanent sterilization) and 
urine dipstick performed to rule out a urinary tract infection.  While the bladder catheter is still in place, subjects 
may have urine and v aginal swab samples collected and stored for possible future analysis (For example, urine 
may be analyzed for biomarkers and microbiome analysis). Those who will undergo fMRI will also undergo a 
brief simulation of the procedure to be performed in the fMRI ; their bladders will be filled and emptied and they 
will rate their urge to void (from 0 -10) while this occurs. This will be done in order to decrease anxiety regarding 
the procedure while in the fMRI scanner.   Subjects may undergo hypnotic susceptibility  testing (using the 
validated Stanford C Hypnotic Susceptibility Test) at this time or any time before their 1st intervention treatment.  
 
Visit 3 for fMRI subjects:  Up to eight y of the UUI subjects (approximately half from the hypnotherapy group and 
half from the pharmacotherapy group) willing to have an fMRI and without contraindications to fMRI will 
participate in the fMRI portion of the study and will return for their baseline fMRI. Urine dipstick testing and 
pregnancy testing (in women who are premenop ausal and without a history of a hysterectomy or permanent 
sterilization) will be performed: subjects who are pregnant or who have a urinary tract infection may not undergo 
fMRI testing. FMRI subjects will be pretreated w ith prophylactic antibiotics,  will have a bladder catheter placed 
and will be asked to a) concentrate on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_481483] b) they 
will next have their bladders filled with sterile fluid and be asked to rate the degree of bladder discomfort or “u rge 
to void” experienced during bladder filling c) they will then have the catheters removed, the amount of urine 
voided will be measured and subjects will be discharged to home and given instructions to contact [CONTACT_481548].   
 
The subjects will be randomized to treatment interventions and contact[CONTACT_481549], which must begin within one month. Subjects will be administered 
the Patient Expectation question.  
 
Visits Overview: Hypnotherapy subjects will have a total of [ADDRESS_618541] a total of 8 visits scheduled over 8 weeks with the 
medication counselor (see the following)  
 
Visit for Hypnotherapy Subjects: Visit 3 (for subjects who did not undergo fMRI) Visit 4 (for subjects who did 
undergo fMRI):  Hypnotherapy Subject Visits 3 -10 for those who did not undergo fMRI, Visits 4 -11 for those who 
did undergo fMRI -- 8 hypnotherapy sessio ns over 8 weeks -- Hypnotherapy sessions:  Subjects assigned to 
hypnotherapy will be scheduled for these visits which will be performed by a certified clinical hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], 
other than [CONTACT_481621][INVESTIGATOR_109685]. The hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481484]. Robert  Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685], a certified 
hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481485]. The 
    
[ADDRESS_618542] been instructed to not use the patients’ 
name [CONTACT_481617].  The subjects will undergo [ADDRESS_618543] approximately 60 minutes.  Session #1: The hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481486]; subjects will inform the hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481487] (so that these 
triggers will be avoid ed). Subjects will undergo their 1st hypnotherapy session and hypnosis will then be 
terminated. Session #2: address emotions around UUI and life impact, visualize pelvic floor exercise mechanics, 
and undergo their 2nd hypnotherapy session followed by [CONTACT_481550]. Subjects will receive a CD or 
be instructed how to download a digital recording (for use on a digital device) specially prepared for them to for 
home practice of hypnotherapy sessions. This will occur at either their 2nd or 3rd hypnothe rapy session; they will 
be instructed NOT to listen to the hypnotherapy CD/digital recording while driving and encouraged to listen to 
the CD/digital recording daily and record the home use of their CD/digital recording. Session #3,4,5,6,7; same 
as session  3. Session #8: same as previous sessions. In addition, the subjects will be counseled to expect 
occasional and temporary setbacks in their bladder symptoms and the hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481488].   
 
Pharmacotherapy Visit 3 -10 for subjects who did not undergo fMRI, Visits 4 -11 for those who did undergo fMRI 
---8 medication counseling sessions over 8 weeks -- Medication Counseling Session: Subjects assigned to 
pharmacotherapy (medications) will be scheduled for these vi sits which will be performed by [CONTACT_21724]. 
The subjects will be informed that several or all sessions will be audio -recorded and one or more sessions will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_481551] a 
standardized fashion. Recordings will be stored on the research computer and access to these recordings will 
be available to assigned research personnel only. All recordings will be stored for approximately [ADDRESS_618544] been instructed to not 
use the patients’ name [CONTACT_481617].  Subjects will be scheduled for in 
person visits with the medication counselor who will review  medications and their side effects. However, if 
subjects state these in person visits are overly burdensome, these visits may occur via phone as long as the 
patient comes in for at least [ADDRESS_618545] and at 
the end of the 8 sessions. These sessions will take as long as required/desired for subjects to feel that they have 
received adequate instruction/counseling. Discussion of strategies to cope with their bladder symptoms will 
occur. The expecte d side effects of medications (such as dry mouth, constipation) will be discussed and 
strategies to cope with side effects will also occur.  It is expected that these sessions will take approximately 20 -
60 minutes, depending on the subjects’ needs. The med ication may be changed if the patient complains of side -
effects from the initial anti -cholinergic or perceives that her response in UUI treatment is inadequate; a different 
anti-cholinergic may be given to the patient if she requests a different UUI medica tion. The study will use either 
of two standard, long acting anti -cholinergic medications and dosages (Long acting Tolterodine 4mg/day or 
Extended Release Oxybutynin 10 mg/day). Initial medication use will usually be Oxybutynin 10 mg/day but will 
depend on  the patient history (for example those who have used Oxybutynin unsuccessfully will be given 
Tolterodine and vice versa). A recent AHRQ meta -analysis found that there was no difference in effectiveness 
or side -effects between the available anti -cholinergi cs used to treat UUI as long as the medications were 
extended release formulations, such as those used in this study.38 
 
Visit 12 —follow -up fMRI testing (for the fMRI group):  Follow -up fMRI will be performed  on the subjects who had 
baseline fMRIs performed. These will be performed in the same fashion as described in Visit #3.  In addition, 
patients may have urine and vaginal swab samples collected and stored for possible future analysis (For 
example, urine may  be analyzed for biomarkers).  
 
Final visit 11 (for those who did not undergo fMRIs) and Final visit 13 (for those who did undergo fMRI):   The 
final study visit will be scheduled at the end of the hypnotherapy or medication counseling sessions, 
approximatel y 8-[ADDRESS_618546] it performed at this session.  At the final study visit, subjects will 1) be administered the OABq -
SF, ISI, the PPBC, CRADI -8, IBS Module and IC q uestionnaires, PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12 and answer the question regarding 
    
16 
  how well the therapy met their expectations for treatment. Their compliance with medications or home practice 
of hypnotherapy will be documented 2) They will return their follow -up voiding diary 3) r eceive patient incentives 
for the time and inconvenience they have experienced from study participation.  In addition, patients may have 
urine and vaginal swab samples collected and stored for possible future analysis (For example, urine may be 
analyzed for  biomarkers).   
 
Length of visits: Each hypnotherapy session will last approximately [ADDRESS_618547] 
inconvenience.  
 
B. NORMATIVE CONTROLS PARTICIPATING IN ONLY THE FMRI STUDY:  
In addition to the UUI study subjects described previously, we will also enroll a group of women without UUI and 
OAB symptoms (and with OAB Awareness Tool screening questionnaire scores < 8). This normative group 
(approximately 30-35 subjects) will keep vo iding diaries, answer questionnaires, and undergo urine pregnancy 
and dipstick testing and cystometric testing and receive prophylactic antibiotics (as described previously) 
followed by [CONTACT_481552] a Brain MRI in order to compare baseline fMRIs in women  with and without UUI.

whether she wants to participate in the study. If subject states she is certain that she wants to participate, she 
has the option of signing the consent at t his time. If the consent is signed, then the subject is administered the 
medical history and demographic forms. If subject states at this visit that she would like to participate in the study, 
appointments are scheduled for the cystometry and fMRI and arra ngements are made for the patient to receive 
prophylactic antibiotics prior to the bladder catheterizations. If patient is uncertain whether she wants to 
participate, the research coordinator’s contact [CONTACT_481553].

Screening log  
A screening log of potential participants will be kept with the following information recorded:  date of screening, 
date of informed consent, whether or not subj ect was enrolled, participant identification number, reason for 
termination, and whether or not a study termination visit was conducted.  
 
Consent procedures  
Subjects will be recruited in a private setting (a patient consult or exam room) by a member of the  research team. 
Subjects will be asked if they are interested in study participation in a private setting, and if they verbalize interest, 
they will be given a copy of the consent forms to read. The patient will be given ample time to consider 
participatio n.  They will have questions answered by [CONTACT_481559]. If they choose to 
participate after taking the consent hom e, subjects will be offered arrangements for subjects to return to the 
study site and sign the consent in the presence of a study investigator, and they will sign the consent in a private 
setting (consult or exam room or office).  Subjects with UUI will be  randomized to treatment with either: 1) 
Pharmacotherapy (a standard therapy for UUI) and conventional behavioral therapy or 2) Hypnotherapy and 
conventional behavioral therapy. Approximately 152 women will be randomized to hypnotherapy or to 
pharmacothera py with approximately half in each group. Up to eight y UUI subjects willing and able to undergo 
fMRI (who meet inclusion & exclusion criteria) will also participate in the fMRI portion of the study. All subjects 
will give signed informed consent prior to s tudy treatment. Approximately 30-[ADDRESS_618553] behavioral therapy (see the “Lifestyle Modification, Behavioral 
Therapy and Physical Floor Therapy Handout”)  
 
Hypnotherapy: Hypnotherapy will be administered over [ADDRESS_618554] been instructed to not use the patients’ name [CONTACT_481618].  Sessions will last approximately 1 hour with a brief outline of these sessions as follows; Session #1: 
The hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481490]; subjects will inform the hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481491] (so that these trigge rs will be avoided). Subjects will undergo their 1st hypnotherapy session 
and hypnosis will then be terminated. Session #2: address emotions around OAB and life impact, visualize pelvic 
floor exercise mechanics, and undergo their 2nd hypnotherapy session f ollowed by [CONTACT_481560]. 
Subjects may choose to either receive a CD or to download a digital recording (for use on a digital device) 
specially prepared for them to for home practice of hypnotherapy sessions. This will occur at either their 2nd or 
3rd hypnotherapy session; they will be instructed NOT to listen to the hypnotherapy CD/digital recording while 
driving and encouraged to listen to the CD/digital recording daily and record the home use of their CD/digital 
recording. Session #3,4,5,6,7; s ame as session 3. Session #8: same as previous sessions. In addition, the 
subjects will be counseled to expect occasional and temporary setbacks in their bladder symptoms and the 
hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_481492]. The details of these sessions are 
detailed in the “Hypnotherapy Session Guidelines” (see Attached MOP). Following the 8 weeks of therapy, 
subjects will be encouraged to continue to practice self -hypnosis and/or listen to their home practice CD/digital 
recordin g given to them and this practice will be tracked for the [ADDRESS_618555] one additional hypnotherapy session prior to their 12 -month follow -
up visit: arrangements for the session c an be initiated at their 6 -month follow -up visit . 
 
Potential adverse effects of hypnotherapy include : a) “False Memory Syndrome”: Although, in the 1980s ‘false 
memory syndrome’ was described with the use of hypnotherapy in child abuse survivors, the curren t practice of 
hypnotherapy uses a much different approach to this therapeutic application. Current practice includes open -
ended lines of questioning as opposed to suggestive or leading lines of questioning utilized in the 1980s with 
these victims. Transfor mation of hypnotherapy practices has greatly decreased occurrence of false memory 
syndrome, indeed calling into question its true existence. Recently, the hypermnesia attributed to the hypnotic 
state has been rejected based on more rigorous research.[ADDRESS_618556], the use of hypnotherapy in this study is for 
UUI treatment and recall of emotionally traumatic events will not be part of the protocol. Thus, serious risk to 
subjects undergoing hypnotherapy for UUI is negligible. b) Possibility that hypnotherapy is ine ffective adjunctive 
treatment for urgency urinary incontinence & potential risks regarding home practice hypnotherapy CD/digital 
recording : Hypnotherapy subjects will be clearly instructed to use their home practice CD/digital recording only 
when and where  they are can pay full attention to the CD/digital recording. Specifically they will be instructed 
NOT to drive and listen to the hypnotherapy home practice CD/digital recording. It is possible that hypnotherapy 
is ineffective in urgency urinary incontinen ce treatment. In this case, the subjects will have been inconvenienced 
because of the time devoted to the hypnotherapy sessions.   
 
Pharmacotherapy:  Pharmacotherapy counseling sessions will be administered over [ADDRESS_618557] been 
    
22 
  instructed to not use the patients’ name [CONTACT_481617].  Subjects will be 
scheduled for in per son visits with the medication counselor who will review medications and their side effects. 
However, if subjects state these in person visits are overly burdensome, these visits may occur via phone as 
long as the patient comes in for at least [ADDRESS_618558] 
and at the end of the 8 sessions. These sessions will take as long as required/desired for subjects to feel that 
they have received adequate instruction/counseling. Discussion of strategies to cope with their bladder 
symptoms will occur. The expected side effects of medications (such as dry mouth, constipation) will be 
discussed and strategies to cope with side effects will also occur.  It is expected that these sessions will take 
approximately 20-60 minutes, depending on the subjects’ needs. The medication may be modified if the patient 
complains of side -effects from the initial anti -cholinergic or perceives that her response in UUI treatment is 
inadequate; a different anti -cholinergic may be gi ven to the patient if she requests a different UUI medication. 
The study will use either of two standard, long acting anti -cholinergic medications and dosages (Long acting 
Tolterodine 4mg/day or Extended Release Oxybutynin 10 mg/day or their equivalent gen eric substitutes). Initial 
medication use will usually be Oxybutynin 10 mg/day but will depend on the patient history (for example those 
who have used Oxybutynin unsuccessfully will be given Tolterodine and vice versa). A recent AHRQ meta -
analysis found th at there was no difference in effectiveness or side -effects between the available anti -
cholinergics used to treat UUI as long as the medications were extended release formulations, such as those 
used in this study.38 The details of these sessions are in th e “Pharmacotherapy Session Guidelines” (see 
Attached MOP). Following the 8 weeks of therapy as described previously, subjects will continue to take their 
anti-cholinergic medications and continued use of medication will be tracked for the 1 year duration o f the study.  
 
Potential adverse effects of pharmacotherapy: Subjects randomized to pharmacotherapy will be instructed take 
a standard anticholinergic extended release dose (see above) for urgency incontinence. Subjects with major 
contraindications to antic holinergic medications will be excluded from study participation (see exclusion criteria). 
Serious adverse events related to anticholinergic medications are rare, however mild side -effects are relatively 
common; these include dry mouth, constipation, dyspe psia or mild nausea, dry eyes, and change in urination 
such as urinary hesitancy.38,54 Subjects in this proposal will be informed regarding potential side effects of 
medications, will keep medication logs and will regularly meet with a medication counselor  to review these side 
effects. Minor side effects may include symptoms such as dry mouth, dry eyes or constipation. The original anti -
cholinergic may be changed to a different long acting anti -cholinergic for UUI if the patient finds the minor side 
effects  to be bothersome and wishes to change medications. Serious medication related adverse events occur 
the medication will be discontinued (see protection against risks below). If subjects report urinary retention or 
other symptoms of concern to the medicatio n counselor, subjects will be instructed to stop the medication. 
Simultaneously a clinic visit to the UNM Urogynecology Clinic will be arranged so that subjects may be 
appropriately evaluated. These measures will decrease the risk of harm from study partic ipation.  
 
Functional MRI:  The UUI subjects (approximately half from the hypnotherapy group and half from the 
pharmacotherapy group) willing to have an fMRI and without contraindications to fMRI will participate in the fMRI 
portion of the study and will undergo a baseline fMRI and a follow -up fMRI at the conclusion of their 8 weeks of 
treatment (as descri bed above). Approximately 30-[ADDRESS_618559] urine dipstick testing and pregnancy testing (in women who are premenopausal and without a history 
of a hysterectomy or permanent sterilization) performed  prior to fMRI: subjects who are pregnant or who have a 
urinary tract infection may not undergo fMRI testing. The fMRI protocol is below. In brief, FMRI subjects will have 
a bladder catheter placed and will be asked to a) concentrate on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_481493] b) they will next have their bladders filled with sterile fluid and be asked to rate the degree of 
bladder discomfort or “urge to void” experienced during bladder filling c) they will then have the catheters 
remo ved, the amount of urine voided will be measured and subjects will be discharged to home and given 
instructions to contact [CONTACT_481561].  The time required for each fMRI 
session is approximately 1 -2 hours.

  FMRI PROTOCOL:  
FMRI Data Acquisition:  
High resolution T1 [TE (echo time) = 1.64 ms, TR (repetition time) = 2.53 s, 7° flip angle, number of excitations 
(NEX) = 1, slice thickness = 1 mm, FOV (field of view) = 256 mm, resolution = 256 x 256] anatomic images wil l 
be collected on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner at the beginning of each experiment. For each of the FMRI 
tasks, echo -planar images will be collected using a single -shot, gradient -echo Introduction: The fMRI portion of 
this study will be performed at the Mind Research Network (MRN). The study investigator at the MRN has 
extensive experience evaluating the role of the ACC and anterior insula in error monitoring, cognitive control and 
the perception of pain.  His team has investigated the role of the ACC and  anterior insula in the subjective 
experience of pain. Specifically, participants were requested to continuously rate their subjective experience of 
pain on a Likert scale from [ADDRESS_618560] and Task:  
Study participants will complete two tasks while undergoin g FMRI. Presentation software will be programmed to 
control stimulus presentation, synchronize stimulus events with the scanner and collect response data for offline 
analyses. A non -ferrous key -press device will be positioned directly under the subject’s r ight hand to continuously 
(10 Hz sampling frequency) record current voiding urge levels on an 11 -point Likert scale (0 = “no urge” to 10 = 
“worst urge imaginable”). To minimize neuronal activation associated with eye movements, subjects will be 
instructed to maintain visual fixation throughout all trials on the centrally presented cross. An eye -tracking device 
will be used to record saccades during the experiment.                       
Task A :  For this task, participants will be asked to continuously rate their urge levels to void while maintaining 
centrally presented cross. During this time, participants’ bladders will be filled following the methods described 
by [CONTACT_344077].35 A urethral catheter will be placed into the bladder for bladder filling/emp tying.  A small volume 
of saline solution (usually [ADDRESS_618561]’s urge sensations noted on cystometry) will 
be introduced into the empty bladder following which the solution will be repeatedly infused into and withdrawn 
from th e bladder while functional brain imaging is performed. The infusion/withdrawal cycle will be performed, 
more liquid being infused than withdrawn. The bladder will then be filled further until the subject signals strong 
bladder sensation. The volume at whic h this sensation occurs will be recorded and beginning at this bladder 
volume infusion/withdrawal cycles will be repeated during fMRI scanning. Two to [ADDRESS_618562] discomfort.  
Task B : All participants will be asked to maintain fixation on a centrally presented cross. This data will be used 
in conjunction with the results from Task A to perform functional connectivity analyses. All participants will 
complete two FMRI runs of this task totaling [ADDRESS_618563] image of each run will be eliminated 
to account for T1 equilibrium effects in addition to the two dummy scans that are pa rt of the Siemens sequence.  
FMRI Image Processing : The methods used to analyze FMRI data will be similar to those employed by [CONTACT_481562]. Specifically, the current analyses will closely parallel a recent experiment that was conducted 
by [CONTACT_481563]. In that study data were generated in a 
task which required participants to subjectively rate their pain to a cold pressor stimulus. We modeled the 
regressors corresponding to the applicati on of the stimulus (cold temps) as well as the individual subject's pain 
ratings separately. Preprocessing steps of fMRI data obtained during both tasks will include slice correction, 
temporal auto -correlations correction and motion correction. For task A,  a voxel -wise multiple regression analysis 
will be used to estimate the beta weights corresponding to the functional activation resulting from each of the 
separate conditions. The multiple regression will contain one individually tailored demeaned regresso r 
corresponding to each individual subject’s urge to void (urge regressor). The urge regressor will resemble a step 
function, with each button press signaling the onset of either increasing or decreasing subjective levels of urge 
to void. The resulting ste p functions will then be convolved with a gamma variate function derived from known 
    
24 
  parameters of the hemodynamic response. In addition, a regressor corresponding to the inflation and the 
deflation of the bladder will be created by [CONTACT_481564] -course with a gamma variate function  
 
Potential adverse effects of fMRI and bladder catheterization: a) fMRI: These risks are small as MRIs are 
commonly performed clinical procedures without significant risk and without radiation exposure.  Subject s will be 
screened to rule out the presence of metallic objects prior to the MRI scan as an MRI machine is essentially a 
large magnet capable of moving iron containing objects. Absolute caution will be implemented to ensure that 
only non -ferrous objects ar e present during all of the MRI sessions. Participants will be asked to change into 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481494]. Participants will also be scree ned for the presence of a pacemaker or any other metallic 
objects in their body, such as an aneurysm clip, ear implant, or nerve stimulator. Participants with these or other 
metallic devices will not be allowed to participate in the study. As the effects o f MR on pregnancy have not been 
fully studied, subjects are pregnant will be excluded from the study. The MRI may also cause claustrophobia and 
anxiety from loud noises made by [CONTACT_101488]. A two -way intercom system and a video monitoring system will 
provi de continual monitoring of the subject’s condition. If discomfort or concern is expressed or detected, the 
experiment will be stopped and the subject will be given the option to discontinue at any time. Ambient scanner 
noise will be below current recommend ed guidelines.  
b) Bladder catheterization:  In addition to bladder catheter placement for cystometric evaluation those subjects 
who participate in the fMRI portion of the study will also be catheterized at the time of fMRI in order to fill the 
bladder (see  fMRI above).The risks of bladder catheterization, although unlikely, include dysuria, hematuria and 
urinary tract infection.  A meta -analysis concluded that prophylactic antibiotics for complex bladder testing 
decreased significant bactiuria with few side -effects, with a reported range of bactiuria of 1 -8% in the groups 
treated with antibiotic prophylaxis.46 To decrease infection risks of bladder catheterization during this study, 
prophylactic antibiotics will be given to all subjects prior to and for the day of catheterization. Nitrofurantoin or 
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole will be administered prior to and for the day of catheterization. Subjects allergic 
to these medications will be given appropriate alternate antibiotic prophylaxis. Prior to the proced ure, the patient 
will be informed regarding the procedure protocol and potential discomforts and side -effects.  Participants will 
be clearly informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time. Catheterization will be performed using 
sterile tec hnique by [CONTACT_481565]. Additionally, subjects will 
have urine dipsticks checked at study entry and prior to bladder catheterization to ensure absence of urinary 
tract infections. Subjects noting persis tent urinary tract infection symptoms following the tasks will have urine 
dipstick testing and a urine culture performed. Subjects with evidence of a urinary tract infection will be treated 
and urinary infection occurrence will be tracked.  
 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
 
This study involves the use of long -acting Oxybutynin (Ditropan XR 10 mg) and long acting Tolterodine (Detrol 
LA 4 mg), or their equivalent generic substitutions, as pharmacologic therapy for urgency urinary incontinence.  
These med ications will be ordered in bulk by [CONTACT_481566].  
The medications will be signed out from the research pharmacist to the research coordinator for the study 
participant.  The Investigators will request that subjects to return unused medications to the research coordinator 
who will in turn return the unused medications to the pharmacy.  A research pharmacy accounting log tracks 
medications issued to subjects and records information including date, dose number,  amount received, patient 
ID, initials of recorder, and initials of person dispensing drug as well as medications returned. Please refer to the 
MOP Chapter —Pharmacotherapy Handling Chapter and Accountability Log.  
 
For behavioral interventions, pharmacother apy counseling and hypnotherapy interventions, please refer to 
previous section 5.1. None of these interventions will be masked.

  5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
 
5.3.1 Allowed Interventions   
 Behavioral Interventions and Pelvic Floor Exercise (see 5.1 ) 
 IF subjects are already engaging in the following activities, they will be allowed. Subjects will be requested 
to inform the study coordinator if they initiate these activities during the12 months that they participate in 
the study.  
o Meditation  
o Yoga  
o Acupuncture for non -UUI indications  
o Tai Chi  
 
 
5.3.2 Required Interventions  
 Hypnotherapy (if randomized to hypnotherapy group)  
 Medication Counseling and Ditropan XR or Detrol LA or their generic substitutions (if randomized to 
pharmacotherapy group)  
 
5.3.3 Prohibited Interventions  
 No other anticholinergic medications (such as Toviaz®/Fesoterodine or Sanctura®/Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_481495]®/Solifenacin or Enablex®/Darifenacin) or beta 3 agonists (such as Myrbetriq®/Mirabegron)  
for UUI should be taken by [CONTACT_481567]  
 Sacral Neuromodulation for UUI treatment (neuromodulators programmed for other indications are 
allowed)  
 Onabotulinum toxin (“Botox”) injected intravesically for UUI treatment in the last 12 months  
 Acupunctur e specifically administered to treat UUI  
 Herbal remedies specifically designed to treat UUI  
 
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Non-adherence/Non -Compliance to treatment or use of off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481496] — 
 
Non-adherence/Non -Compliance to treatment protocol at 2 month follow -up of the study:  
Definition Non -adherence/Non -Compliance:  
 
 Medication group: Subjects state ‘no’ on the Pharmacotherapy Compliance form (question 
#1) that they are no longer ta king their medications at 2 month follow -up 
 Hypnotherapy group: Attendance of < 60% of hypnotherapy appointments  
 
Measures of adherence and compliance and steps taken to improve non -adherence during 1st 12 weeks of the 
study:  Data on adherence to the treatment protocol will be collected weekly dur ing the treatment phase of the 
study by [CONTACT_361335]. Pharmacotherapy adherence/compliance will be tracked 
with the  compliance questionnaires at 2, 6 and 12 months. Hypnotherapy adherence/compliance will be tracked 
by [CONTACT_481568] 2, 6, and 12 months. Off -protocol 
treatments used will also be tracked based on the compliance questionnaires administered at 2, 6 and 12 
months.  Data on adherence will be reviewed at each o f the DSMB meetings (described subsequently).  Available 
data on the use of anti -cholinergics for urgency urinary incontinence suggests an overall non -compliance or 
withdrawal rate of 30% in randomized controlled trials.[ADDRESS_618564] been 
reported to be even higher with continuation rates less 45% at 1 month and 13% at 1 year.21 If average adherence 
falls below the suggested rate of 60%, a conference call will occur for study investigators to discuss methods for 
improving  adherence without affecting the integrity of the study. However, given the data regarding anti -
cholinergic side effects, it is quite possible that this non -adherence rate is not changeable. Protocol adherence 
in subjects randomized to hypnotherapy will be  measured by [CONTACT_481569][INVESTIGATOR_481497] 
    
26 
  appointments. If adherence of hypnotherapy subjects falls below a suggested rate of less than 60%, a conference 
call for study personnel to discuss methods for improving treatment adherence will oc cur.   
 
Non-adherence/Non -Compliance or use of off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_193238] 6, 12 month follow -up visits  
Definition of Non -adherence/Non -Compliance at 6 & 12 month follow -up:  
 Medication group: Subjects state ‘no’ on the Pharmacotherapy Compliance form (question #1) that they 
are no longer taking their medications at 6 or 12 month follow -up 
 Hypnotherapy group: Subjects who state ‘no’ on the Hypnotherapy Compliance form (question #1) that 
they are not  listening to their hypnotherapy CD/digital recording or practicing self -hypnosis at 6 or 12 
month follow -up  
 
Definition of use of off -protocol  treatments  
 Subjects use other treatments for UUI such as sacral neuromodulation, intravesical botox in the last 12 
months or other UUI medications (such as Toviaz®/Fesoterodine or Sanctura®/Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_481495]®/Solifenacin or Enablex®/Darifenacin or Myrb etriq®/Mirabegron)  
 Subjects use acupuncture to specifically to treat UUI  
 Subjects use herbal remedies specifically to treat UUI  
 
For Analysis of non -compliance or use of off -protocol treatments:  See Section 9.5.Subjects who are non -
compliant or use off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481498]. When subjects implement off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], we will examine the sensitivity of the per protocol 
analyses in two ways.  First, we will modify the models to i ncorporate a time -varying treatment parameter that 
can be used to examine the effect of received treatment. Second, we will censor all measurements after they 
receive alternative treatment, and then impute all censored measurements based on information col lected from 
those who do not switch. Non -Compliance will be analyzed in the per -protocol analysis first as a categorical 
variable (yes/no) in its relationship to the outcome(s) and will then be evaluated as continuous variables (i.e. nu 
times self -hypnosis  practiced or CD/digital recording used) and its relationship to the outcome(s).

  6.2 Description of Evaluations  
6.2.1  Screening Evaluation  
Screening visit – Potential participants will be screened by [CONTACT_14676]/Study personnel before enrollment 
to determine eligibility for the RCT portion of the study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects will also 
be screened for fMRI eligibility; however if the subject is ineligible for the fMRI, they may still participate in the 
RCT portion of the study. In general, the consent will be obtained within [ADDRESS_618565] the study explained to them and follow the same procedures as UNMH 
subjects (see following). Po tential subjects will be given a copy of the study consent for their review. Those who 
are interested will be administered the OAB Awareness tool, a validated measure which screens for presence of 
OAB, to screen whether or not they are candidates for the s tudy. They will also be instructed how to keep a 
voiding diary, if this has not already been done, as it is the standard of clinical care for all subjects with UUI. If 
they ultimately choose to participate in the study, they will be asked to bring the diar y with them for Visit 1 (below). 
The patient will be given the option to schedule Study Visit [ADDRESS_618566] the study coordinator 
to schedule Study Visit 1 at a later date if they are uncertain regarding study participation.  
 
6.2.2  Enrol lment, Baseline Visit/Evaluation and Randomization  
Enrollment/Consent & Baseline Visit for women in RCT (Day -60 to -1):  
Informed Consent Process: Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject at study entry. And will 
be obtained by [CONTACT_38733]:  
1) Subjects will be asked if they are interested in study participation in a private setting, and if they verbalize 
interest, a copy of the consent forms will be explained and given to them to review so that they may 
discuss the study with family and friends.   
2) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Is will meet with subjects to review the consent form and confirm the subject’s understanding 
of the study and to answer their questions. Subjects will answer screening questions to ensure they are 
appropriate candidates for the study.  
3) If subjects state that they are interested in study participation after explanation of the study as noted 
previously, an appointment will be made for subjects to return to sign the consent and fill out the baseline 
information and questionnaires.  
4) If they stat e that they are not certain, they will be given the study coordinator’s contact [CONTACT_481570]; a study appointment will be made 
for subjects to return to sign the consent after they contact [CONTACT_3462].   
5) At the enrollment appointment, which occurs in a private setting, subjects sign the consent after study 
personnel are certain that subjects have had appropriate counseling and understanding regarding the 
study and that the st udy and consent have been explained to them in a fashion congruent with their 
medical literacy. Consent will be obtained after screening is performed and will be re -reviewed in the 
future in the event changes are required. In general, consent will be obtai ned at the baseline visit. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Is, Study Coordinator(s) or Study Nurse(s) will obtain verbal and written informed consent on 
one IRB approved consent after explaining study and before collecting any data. Human subject’s 
protection will follow loc al and national regulations at all times.  
 
Baseline assessments include:  
 Questionnaires – OABq -SF, ISI, PPBC, PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12, CRADI -8, IBS Module, IC & VAS pain 
questionnaire  
 Voiding Diary  
 Demographics form  
 Medical history form  
 POP -Q examination if one has not be en performed during their routine clinical examination 
    
[ADDRESS_618567] year (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation Exam, a validated examination 
recommended by [CONTACT_481571]’ prolapse)  
 
Arrangemen ts will be made for cystometric testing, Stanford hypnotic susceptibility testing, and fMRI testing (if 
the subject is willing and without contraindications to fMRI). The expectation question will also be explained to 
subjects but will not be formally admi nistered until the subject has been randomized to treatment. Adverse events 
will be tracked and followed up appropriately as noted in the DSMP. Subjects willing to participate in the fMRI 
study will be screened regarding whether or not they meet criteria f or entry into the fMRI study. Subjects who 
meet criteria and who are willing to participate in the fMRI portion of the study will be scheduled for their fMRI or 
arrangements will be made to contact [CONTACT_481572]/time of their fMRI.  The subjects will 
be randomized within a month of obtaining the consent.  
 
Enrollment/Consent & Baseline Visit for Normative Controls ONLY participating in fMRI study (Day 0): In 
addition to the UUI study subjects described previously, a group of women without UUI and without OAB 
symptoms (also determined by [CONTACT_481573]) will be enrolled. This 
normative group (approximately 30-35 subjects) will  keep voiding diaries, answer questionnaires, and undergo 
urine pregnancy and dipstick testing and cystometric testing followed by [CONTACT_481574]. The consenting process will be the s ame as described 
for the UUI subjects.  For this group of women, cystometrics may be performed the same day they are enrolled 
and fMRI will be scheduled for the following week (if this is not possible, the fMRI should be scheduled within 2 
weeks). The proc edures will be performed as outlined previously and subsequently in 6.4.3 and 6.4.4.  
 
Baseline Cystometrics  
Cystometrics (Day -60 to -1) Cystometric  testing (a bladder filling test during which patient sensations are 
recorded at various volumes and evidence of stress or urgency incontinence recorded) will be performed. Testing 
includes a urine pregnancy test and urine dipstick. See MOP Chapter “Study Procedures” regarding forms to be 
filled. If subject chooses to undergo an fMRI, they will have simulation of their fMRI task performed  and may 
have urine and vaginal swab samples collected and stored for possible future analysis (For example, urine may 
be analyzed for biomarkers and microbiome analysis. S ee MOP Chapter “Study Procedures” regarding forms to 
be filled as noted in Section 5.1.  
Baseline FMRI  
FMRI (Day -60 to -1 for baseline and week 9 for follow -up) will be performed on women willing and able to 
have fMRI at baseline and follow -up. Testing includes a urine pregnancy test and urine dipstick. Forms to be 
completed include the fMRI procedure are noted in the “Study Procedures” MOP and has been described in the 
Protocol Section 5.1.  
 Other Baseline  Tests/Questionnaires  
Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Testing (Day -60 to week 1)  this validated test may be administered by [CONTACT_481575][INVESTIGATOR_481499]. 
Its administrat ion depends primarily on scheduling issues between the subject and hypnotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]; attempts will 
be made to couple this testing with any of the subjects’ pre -treatment visits (enrollment, cystometrics, fMRI) 
though the subject may have to come for a separa te visit if this is not possible.  
Patient Expectation Question (Day 0 and prior to treatment) the subject will be administered this question 
after randomization and prior to treatment. The question will be explained to the patient at enrollment, but will 
not be administered until the patient is notified regarding her group assignment by [CONTACT_481576].  
 
 
 
 
    
31 
   
Randomization  
Randomization to Treatment (Day 0) Subjects will be informed of their randomization to treatment by [CONTACT_25258] (or her designee if she is absent). Please refer to Statistics Section 9.  Randomization will 
occur within 2-month s of Enrollment. Treatment visits will be initiated within one month following randomization 
with a goal of initiating treatment within 1 week. However, subjects will be given the necessary time to prepare 
for their upcoming weekly treatment sessions.  
6.2.3 Blinding  
This study is a single blinded trial. Eve ry effort will be made to maintain masking until the study’s completion of 
treatment of the [ADDRESS_618568], study personnel performing data entry an d the study statistician will be blinded to 
knowledge of subjects’ treatment groups. Investigator blinding will only be breached if a subject suffers an 
unexpected clinical event and investigator knowledge of the subject’s treatment is essential to providi ng standard 
of care. Subjects cannot be blinded to treatment interventions as it will be obvious to them whether or not they 
are undergoing hypnotherapy or taking medications.  
6.2.4 Treatment Visits  
Treatment Visits (weeks 1 -8) Depending on randomization, participants will either undergo medication 
counseling sessions or hypnotherapy sessions. These visits are expected to be initiated within one month 
following randomization with the goal of initiating treatment within [ADDRESS_618569] treatment.  
 
The number of sessions attended by [CONTACT_481577]. Th e Medication side effects/incontinence log and 
the Hypnotherapy CD -digital recording use/incontinence logs will be collected at the visits. Please refer to section 
[ADDRESS_618570] follow -up assessments irrespective whether they discontinue study interventions or are 
non-compliant with interventions or use off -protocol treatments.  
 
Follow -up Assessment at End of Treatm ent ( weeks [ADDRESS_618571] had fMRI): A 
subject visit will be arranged by [CONTACT_481578] -treatment (end of counseling/hypnotherapy session) 
assessments which should occur within [ADDRESS_618572] urine  and vaginal swab  samples collected and stored for possible future analysis (For 
example, urine may be analyzed for bioma rkers).  
The assessments and visit will include

6.2.6 Completion/Final Evaluation  
12 month Follow -up (month 12) The Study Coordinator or her designee will arrange [ADDRESS_618574] has a 
phone/mail visit arrangements for reimbursement will be made following  completion of this visit. The follow -up 
assessment sho uld be completed within 10-14 months of completion of hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy 
sessions. These same evaluations will be needed for subjects who discontinue study interventions early. 
Potential r easons for early termination include events which results in distress to the subjects as a result of study 
participation (See Chapter 7 Safety and Chapter 8 Intervention Discontinuation) and follow -up for all subjects 
who discontinue interventions but are willing to continue to participate in the study will be the same as though 
who continue the interventions (12 months).  
Final assessments & follow -up include  
 Questionnaires; OABq -SF, ISI, PPBC, PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12, CRADI -8, IBS Module and IC questionnaire. Follow -up 
Expectation Question and Compliance Questionnaire  
 Voiding Diary  
 Subject feedback regarding study participation  
 Thank subjects for study participation  
 
7. Safety Assessments  
Potential complications of the study interventions will be tracked (as described subsequently) and include the 
following;  
 
Hypnotherapy  
 Severe emotional upset  
 CD/digital recording use while performing activities requiring intense concentration (driving)  
‘False Memory Syndrome’ and severe emotional upset --- Relevant background, managem ent and modification 
of intervention or participant assessments: Although, in the 1980s ‘false memory syndrome’ was described with 
the use of hypnotherapy in child abuse survivors, the current practice of hypnotherapy uses a much different 
approach to this  therapeutic application. Current practice includes open -ended lines of questioning as opposed 
to suggestive or leading lines of questioning utilized in the 1980s with these victims. Transformation of 
hypnotherapy practices has greatly decreased occurrence  of false memory syndrome. Recently, the 
hypermnesia attributed to the hypnotic state has been rejected based on more rigorous research.[ADDRESS_618575] reports severe emotional upset attributed to the sessions, her sessions will be terminated. In the 
unlikely event that >33% of study subjects report that they experience serious emotional upset from study 
participation the study will be suspended and a review will occur. If these events are found to be attributable to 
hypnotherapy, the study will continue to be suspended until the  hypnotherapy protocol is re -evaluated and 
revised (see below). Serious emotional upset includes inability to work or events that would necessitate 
evaluation by a physician or care provider. It is highly unlikely that hypnotherapy would unmask or de -repre ss 
significant emotional upset (e.g. hysteria, uncontrollable anger or hostility) in subjects. The potential for this 
occurring will be minimized by [CONTACT_42792] a history of schizophrenia or untreated bipolar disorder 
and by [CONTACT_481579][INVESTIGATOR_481500]. Although other hypnotherapy studies have not reported significant 
    
[ADDRESS_618576] of subjects 
complain of significant emotional upset, the study should be halted until the circumstances surrounding its 
occurrence are investigated in depth.  
 
Use of CD/digital recording while performing activities requiring intense concentration (driving) --Management 
and modification of intervention or participant assessments: Hypnotherapy subjects will be clearly instructed to 
ONLY use their hypnotherapy home practice CD/digital recording when and where they are can pay full attention 
to the recording. They will clearly be instructed NOT to listen to the hypnotherapy CD/digital recording during 
activities which require their full attention; specifically the wil l be instructed NOT to drive and listen to the home 
hypnotherapy practice CD/digital recording. If it is found that subjects listen to the CD/digital recording while they 
are driving, the PIs and Study Coordinator will generate a report and develop an acti on plan including protocol 
revision which will be given to the DSMB.  
 
Pharmacotherapy:  
 Constipation  
 Dry Eyes  
 Dry mouth  
 Dyspepsia or Nausea  
 Urinary Hesitancy or Retention  
Relevant background, management and modification of intervention or participant asses sment for the above: 
Serious adverse events related to anticholinergic medications are rare, however mild side -effects are relatively 
common; these include dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia or mild nausea, dry eyes, and change in urination 
such as urinary  hesitancy, as reported in an AHRQ and Cochrane meta -analysis.38,54 Subjects in this proposal 
will be informed regarding potential side effects of medications, will keep medication logs and will regularly meet 
with a medication counselor to review these si de effects. If symptoms such as dry mouth, dry eyes, dyspepsia 
or constipation occur, if the patient finds the minor side effects to be bothersome and wishes to change 
medications the original anti -cholinergic may be changed to the alternate long acting an ti-cholinergic. If there is 
a greater degree of symptom severity (e.g. obstipation, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention) the medication 
will be discontinued. A clinic visit to the UNM Urogynecology Clinic will be arranged so that the subjects may be 
appropriately evaluated. If subjects report symptoms of concern to the medication counselor or other study 
personnel, subjects will be instructed to stop the medication and a clinic visit to the UNM Urogynecology Clinic 
will be arranged so that subjects may b e appropriately evaluated. These measures will decrease the risk of harm 
from study participation. It is unlikely that these FDA approved, routinely prescribed medications will result in 
serious harm, but if significant events are reported, subjects will b e evaluated and the PIs and Study Coordinator 
will generate a report and which will be distributed to the DSMB, HRPO (if meets HRPO reporting guidelines see 
7.4) and NCCAM consistent with NCCAM policies (see 7.4). If the events are attributable to the medi cations, an 
action plan will be developed which may include protocol modification.  
 
Bladder Catheterization  
 Dysuria  
 Hematuria  
 Urinary Tract Infection  
Relevant background, management and modification of intervention or participant assessment for the above:  
Subjects will have bladder catheters placed for their cystometric evaluation and those who participate in the fMRI 
portion of the study will also be catheterized to undergo bladder filling for the fMRI task. Cystometric evaluation 
is considered a routine s tandard of care procedure for women with urgency urinary incontinence. The risks of 
bladder catheterization, although unlikely, include dysuria, hematuria and urinary tract infection.  A recent meta -
analysis concluded that prophylactic antibiotics for comp lex bladder testing decreased significant bactiuria with 
few side -effects, with a reported range of bactiuria of 1 -8% in the groups treated with antibiotic prophylaxis.46To 
    
34 
  decrease infection risks of bladder catheterization during this study, prophylactic  antibiotics will be given to all 
subjects prior to and the day of catheterization. Nitrofurantoin or Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole will be 
administered prior to and the day of catheterization. Subjects allergic to these medications will be given 
appropria te alternate antibiotic prophylaxis. Prior to the procedure, the patient will be informed regarding the 
procedure protocol and potential discomforts and side -effects.  Participants will be clearly informed of their right 
to withdraw from the study at any t ime. Catheterization will be performed using sterile technique by [CONTACT_481580]. Additionally, subjects will have urine dipsticks checked at 
study entry and prior to bladder catheterization to ensure abs ence of urinary tract infections. Subjects noting 
persistent urinary tract infection symptoms following the tasks will have urine dipstick testing and a urine culture 
performed. Subjects with evidence of a urinary tract infection will be treated. UTI, hema turia and dysuria 
occurrence will be tracked and AEs reported to the DSMB. If these events occur in 10% or more subjects, the 
protocol will be reviewed and revised.   
 
FMRI  
 Claustrophobia and Anxiety  
 Dysuria, Hematuria and Urinary Tract Infection due to catheterization  
 Unexpected Abnormality on MRI  
Relevant background, management and modification of intervention or participant assessment for the above:  
These risks are small as MRIs are commonly performed clinical procedures without significant risk and wi thout 
radiation exposure.  To avoid the claustrophobia and anxiety which may occur with fMRI performance, subjects 
will be screened to rule out a history of claustrophobia prior to the MRI. Since the MRI may cause claustrophobia 
and anxiety from loud noises  made by [CONTACT_101488] (despi[INVESTIGATOR_481501]), a two -way intercom system and a video monitoring system will 
provide continual monitoring of the subject’s condition. If discomfort or c oncern is expressed or detected, the 
experiment will be stopped and the subject will be given the option to discontinue at any time. This event will be 
recorded. Please refer to evaluation and approach to events which may be associated with bladder 
cathete rization described above. If an unexpected significant brain abnormality is found on fMRI the subject will 
be referred to her primary physician or other appropriate physician to evaluate the abnormality/finding.  
 
Any of the following  
 Possible breach of co nfidentiality, stress, emotional distress and inconvenience:  
 
Relevant background, management and modification of intervention or participant assessment for the above:  
These risks are possible with participation in any research study and will be minimized . In the unlikely 
circumstance that confidentiality is breeched potential embarrassment associated with the diagnosis of urgency 
urinary incontinence may occur. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_20526] a study number to each participant upon 
entry into the  study and with the other measures described previously under Section III: Confidentiality in the 
DSMP. The stress, emotional distress and inconvenience will be minimized by [CONTACT_30224], enrolling, evaluating 
and treating subjects in a private setting (priv ate clinic exam rooms and private consultative, administrative, 
research and practitioners offices). The patient will reassured that declining study participation will have no effect 
on their current or future clinical care. HIPAA consent will be signed in  accordance with the UNMH HRPO (IRB) 
and the patient informed of the protections that HIPAA guarantees to the privacy of their health information. To 
further ensure the security of personal health information all data will be de -identified as described abo ve. The 
database will be password protected and accessible only to research personnel.   Only coded information will 
be entered into the database. All paper -based study subject folders will be kept in a locked cabinet in the 
Urogynecology research division  administrative area. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481502] a one on one setting. 
Appointments for therapy will be scheduled with efforts made to minimize inconvenience to the subject while 
maintaining study fidelity and completing counseling therapi[INVESTIGATOR_6523] a two month window.  
 
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Events will be captured by [CONTACT_481581] 7.4 and include;  
1) potential breach of confidentiality 2) lack of adherence to functional MRI screening for metallic objects near 
MRI scanner or potential lack of adherence to pregnancy and UTI screening 3) request for MRI termination due 
to anxiety, claustro phobia while in the scanner 4) symptoms of dysuria, hematuria or urinary tract infections 
    
35 
  associated with bladder catheterization 5) potential symptoms related to anticholinergic use such as severe 
nausea/vomiting or constipation, or inability to void 6) p otential symptoms related to hypnotherapy sessions such 
severe emotional upset which interferes with subject functioning 7) failure of subjects to comply with 
hypnotherapy CD/audio -recording  instructions regarding prohibition of driving while listening to  the recordings  
 
7.[ADDRESS_618577] the 
more significant potential symptoms/side effects  of the interventions noted above and are further explained in 
Section 7.4 as well.  
 
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during participation in the clinical study  
or with the use of the interventions being studied. An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal 
assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, electrocardiogram findings, etc.) or any combination of these. 
AEs will be recorded regardless of their relationship to the study intervention.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening 
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent  or significant 
disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly. Generally, an SAE can result in one or more of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent o r significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event based upon appropriate medical judgment  
Classification of AE Severity  
AEs will be labeled according to severity, which is based on their impact on the pati ent. An AE will be termed 
“mild” if it does not have a major impact on the patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some minor 
inconvenience and “severe” if it causes a substantial disruption to the patient’s well -being.  
 
AE Attribution Scale  
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study intervention. Specifically, 
they will be labeled definitely unrelated, possibly related, probably related or definitely related to the study 
intervention.  
 
AE Guidelines  Adverse events will be reported in a manner consistent with the UNM HRPO (Human Research 
Protections Office) and NCCAM policies (See below).  
 
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
Monitoring of Adverse Events & Frequency of Periodic Observations & Reporting & Follow -up: Adverse events 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_481582]. At each clinic visit or 
follow -up telephone call, subjects will be asked to recall any adverse events since the time of their last contact 
(either via p hone call, in -person clinic or study visit). The Study Coordinator (or her surrogate in her absence) 
will record the information using a standardized format and report the data to the PI’s. If the AE is a reportable 
event as defined by [CONTACT_481583] (i.e. m eets all the following criteria; it was unanticipated, caused harm or 
placed a person at increased risk of harm, and was more likely than not to have been related to the research) it 
will also be reported to the UNM HRPO (see UNM HRPO “Event form” attached  which must be signed by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designee in his/her absence and supporting documentation including the current consent) and the DSMB. 
The UNM HRPO will be notified of reportable events as soon as possible and within 5 days of the event date or 
    
36 
  the “si te awareness” date. AEs will be followed until they are resolved or considered stable, typi[INVESTIGATOR_481503], although this time will be extended to up to 4 -6 months, depending on the instability of the event.  
 
SAEs  will be immediately (i.e. as soon as the Investigators or Study personnel are made aware that an SAE 
occurred ) reported to the UNM IRB (HRPO) as per IRB guidelines and the NIH Project Officer and addressed 
by [CONTACT_481584] (see SAEs below).  
 
 A Data Safety and Monitoring Board has been identified for this study. AE reports will be generated using 
standard forms, including the Adverse Event Case Report Form and Serious Adverse Event Case Report Form 
(see attached). The DSMB will meet quarterly for the first year and the DSMB will reassess and determine 
whether observations can be reviewed semi -annually thereafter. During the DSMP formal meetings the events 
will be reviewed. The severity of the event will be determined and an action plan to avoid  recurrence of events 
(if found to be attributable to study participation) will be formulated and implemented. Research related adverse 
events will be reviewed and annual reports which include AE reports, subject enrollment/withdrawals and 
protocol violati ons will be generated for the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Human Research 
Protections Office (HRPO), Data Safety Monitoring Board and NCCAM/NCCAM Project Officer.  
 
 
SAE Reporting  
SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly relate d to the study intervention will be reported to the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board, the Human Research Protections Office (HRPO), and NCCAM in accordance with 
requirements.  
 
• Unexpected fatal or life -threatening SAEs related to the interventions will be rep orted to the NCCAM 
Program Officer within 7 days (and will result in emergency convening of the Data Safety Monitoring Board). We 
will observe all UNM HRPO SAE reporting policies (see prior section). Other serious and unexpected AEs related 
to the interven tion will be reported to the NCCAM Program Official within 15 days.  
 
• Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be reported to the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board, the UNM HRPO, NCCAM and other oversight organizations in accordance with their 
requirements. In the annual AE summary, the Independent Monitor Report (Data Safety Monitoring Board) will 
state that they have reviewed all AE reports.

8. Intervention Discontinuation  
Interventions will be discontinued if they result in substantial disruption to the subject’s well -being with potential 
events listed  in section 7.  
 
Hypnotherapy will be discontinued for the individual subject if the subject complains of severe emotional upset 
attributed to hypnotherapy. Serious emotional upset includes inability to work or events that would necessitate 
evaluation by a physician or care provider. It is unlikely that this will occur. The potential for this occurring will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_42792] a history of schizophrenia or untreated bipolar disorder and by [CONTACT_481585][INVESTIGATOR_481505]. However, though it is highly unlikely that hypnotherapy could potentially unmask or 
de-repress significant emotional upset (see Section 7) if a subject reports serious emotional upset from 
hypnotherapy, the intervention will be terminated and reported. The subject will continue to be followed clinically 
by [CONTACT_481586]. If necessary, a Behavioral Health Consultation will be generat ed 
and will result in a meeting of the PIs and review of the issues surrounding its occurrence. The subject will be 
followed after intervention discontinuation (if it is found to be directly attributable to the intervention) until it 
resolves, typi[INVESTIGATOR_481506] a month but potentially longer. The PIs and Study coordinator will generate a report, 
assess whether it was preventable, and develop an action plan to prevent recurrence including potential protocol 
revision and this will be reported immediately to th e DSMB.  
 
If serious medication related adverse events occur (significant urinary retention, debilitating constipation or 
nausea and vomiting) the medication will be discontinued. A clinic visit to the UNM Urogynecology  Clinic will be 
arranged so that the subjects may be appropriately evaluated. If subjects report urinary retention or symptoms 
of a urinary tract infection or other symptoms of concern to the medication counselor or other study personnel, 
subjects will be instructed to stop the medication and a clinic visit to the UNM Urogynecology Clinic will be 
arranged so that subjects may be appropriately evaluated. Urinary retention will be evaluated by [CONTACT_481587]. These measures will d ecrease the risk of harm from study participation. It 
is unlikely that these routinely prescribed medications will result in serious harm, but if serious complications are 
reported, subjects will be evaluated and the PIs and Study Coordinator will generate  a report and which will be 
given to the DSMB. If the events, such urinary retention or persistent urinary tract infections are directly 
attributable to the medications, an action plan will be developed which may include discontinuation of the 
treatment, p otential protocol revision. The subject will be followed until the problem resolves, typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] a 
month but potentially longer.  
 
Participants will continue to be followed with their permission if a study intervention is discontinued for the 
duration of the study (if the participant is willing). All data will continue to be collected (with the participant’s 
permission) including questionnaires and voiding diaries.

9. Statistical Considerations  
 
9.1 General Design Issues  
This study includes  
1. A single -blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) based on a non -inferiority design which compares 
hypnotherapy to pharmacotherapy in treating UUI.  
 Urge incontinent women (N=152) will be randomized to hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy and 
evaluated at months 2, 6 & [ADDRESS_618580] which will evaluate up to 80 of these women with UUI.  
 These women will undergo fMRI before treatment and their baseline imaging results will be 
compared to  normative controls.  
 In addition, the  UUI subjects participating in the fMRI will undergo imaging after treatment. The 
images of UUI subjects following treatment will be compared to their baseline images.  
 
Specific Aims, Hypotheses and Outcomes;  
 
Primary Outcomes:  
1. Between group differences in change in UUI  epi[INVESTIGATOR_481481] 1 at 2 month follow -up based 
on 3 day voiding diaries  
2. Between group differences in change in activation of limbic cortex and brain connectivity following 
treatment  for Specific Aim 2  
Secondary Outcomes:  
1. Between group difference s in change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481481] 1 from baseline to follow -up 
at both 6 and 12 months based on 3 day voiding diaries.  
2. Between group differences in change in pad counts, voiding frequency and cure (resolution) of UUI 
on voiding diary for Specifi c Aim 1 at 2, 6 and 12 month follow -up as well as “durable cure” 
(resolution of UUI on all follow -up diaries at 2, 6 & 12 months)  
3. Between group differences in the follow -up expectation question and between group differences  in 
questionnaire change scores (the OAB -qSF, ISI,  PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12, Global questionnaire, CRADI -8, IBS 
Module, IC questionnaire) for Specific Aim 1 at 2, 6 and 12 month follow -up 
4. Baseline differences in activation of the limbic cortex and brain connectivity in women with UUI 
compared to normati ve controls for Specific Aim 2  
 
 
1. Specific Aim 1 : Determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is as, or is more effective and 
durable, in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) than a non -mind/body treatment (pharmacotherapy)  
Hypothesis : Among  patients with urgency urinary incontinence, hypnotherapy ameliorates abnormal perception 
of bladder distension outside the hypnotic state and thereby [CONTACT_481588] (or more effectively than) ph armacotherapy  
 
Clinical response of UUI subjects to Hypnotherapy compared to Pharmacotherapy Outcomes:  
The primary outcome for the analysis of Objective 1  will be change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481507] 2 months based on 3 day voiding diaries.  
 
Secondary outcome measures of Objective 1  will include differences between the hypnotherapy and 
pharmacotherapy g roups regarding change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 6 and 12 months, and change in urinary 
frequency, pad counts and cure (defined as zero UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) on voiding diaries at 2, 6 and 12 month follow -
up, and “Durable Cure” of UUI (defined as zero UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481508] 2, 6 and 
12 month diaries). Secondary outcomes will also compare group differences in expectation attainment (i.e. 
differences in answers to follow -up Expectation question) and between group differences in questionnaire 
change scores [OAB -qSF, ISI, Global (PPBC) questionnaires and Sexual function scores (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12) in those 
women willing to answer the PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12]  while accounting for covariates such as medical history and demographic 
variables as well as pain/interstitial cyst itis (based on VAS pain scale and PBIC -SS) or bowel abnormalities 
    
39 
  (based on the CRADI -8 questionnaire and IBS Module) and evaluating change in the CRADI -8, IBS Module or 
PBIC -SS questionnaires if adequate numbers of subjects are found to have bowel or IC a bnormalities.  
 
A randomized, single -blinded, parallel group active controlled trial using a non -inferiority design was chosen. 
The non -inferiority design was chosen as the control group will be taking an intervention, anti -cholinergics, which 
is the standa rd of standard of care for  women with UUI; we wished to evaluate whether a novel mind -body 
treatment, hypnotherapy, was at least as successful in treating UUI as the standard therapy. Both the primary 
and secondary outcome measures are validated and relia ble measures which accurately reflect UUI severity.  
The International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) recommends that all incontinence research include 
validated questionnaires and voiding diaries.1 The voiding diary adheres to ICI recommended parameter s with 
an intra -class correlation coefficient=.76 and moderate -excellent convergent validity with patient recall as 
measured by [CONTACT_4532]’s rank correlation=.7.[ADDRESS_618581] commonly used primary outcome measure in 
randomized controlled trials, as noted in a r ecent AHRQ Review, is the 3 -7day voiding diary.84 As 3 day voiding 
diaries are as valid as 7 day diaries and are far less burdensome to patients, 3 day diaries will be used in this 
study.8 The OABq -SF, validated for overactive bladder, discriminates betwee n patients who are continent and 
incontinent.15 Internal consistency of its symptom bother subscale (.86) and its quality of life subscale (.89 -.96)

2. Specific Aim 2:  Determine whether hypnotherapy treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence) is 
associated with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI than that which 
occurs following pharmacotherapy.  
Hypothesis 2.1 . Patients with urgency urinary incontinence will exhibit increased activation within portions of the 
limbic cortex (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) during bladder distension relative to healthy controls. Patients 
will also exhibit an a bnormal pattern of functional connectivity within the limbic system.  
Hypothesis 2.2 .  Among patients with urgency incontinence, hypnotherapy will decrease hyper -activation of the 
limbic cortex in response to bladder distension and/or modulate functional c onnectivity within the limbic system.  
Moreover, normalization of hyper -activation and connectivity will be greater in hypnotherapy compared to 
pharmacotherapy  
 
Baseline (pre -treatment) differences between subjects with UUI and healthy controls with respec t to task related 
limbic system activity and resting connectivity in subjects:

9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Power Analysis/ Sample Size Calculation  for Clinical RCT Specific Aim 1: We performed sample size 
calculations for change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481509] -SF scores based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] & urgency 
incontinence literature.11,16,52 The study design will use a non -inferiority design to compare the primary outcome 
(change in UU I epi[INVESTIGATOR_481510]). With respect to the outcome 
variable of percent reduction in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481511], we will use a one -sided non -
inferiority test at level alpha = 0.25 and a non -inferior ity margin of 5%.  If 𝜇ℎis the population mean percent 
reduction in incontinent epi[INVESTIGATOR_481512], and 𝜇𝑚 is the population mean percent reduction 
in incontinent epi[INVESTIGATOR_481513], we will then test H0: 𝜇ℎ−𝜇𝑚≤−[ADDRESS_618586] the one -sided 
alternative H𝐴: 𝜇ℎ−𝜇𝑚>−5 using significance level 0.025.  If the null hypothesis is rejected then we may 
conclude hypnotherapy is not inferior to medication therapy, on average, by [CONTACT_726] 5%, and in fact may be 
superior to med ication therapy, with respect to percent reduction in incontinent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The test may be 
performed by [CONTACT_481589] 97.5% one -sided confidence bound for 𝜇ℎ−𝜇𝑚. If the lower confidence bound 
exceeds -5% we will conclude non -inferiority of hypnot herapy.  Should that lower bound exceed zero we will 
conclude superiority.  Assuming a subject drop -out, withdrawal and missing data rate as high as 33%, 52 subjects 
will be available for analysis in both hypnotherapy and medications groups. If 𝜇ℎ−𝜇𝑚 ≥ 9%, this sample size 
would provide power ≥ 80% for the non -inferiority test. Rigorous efforts will be made to reach an achieved attrition 
rate of 20 -25%, such that approximately 60 subjects would be available for analysis in each group. This would 
allow fo r detecting non -inferiority if the actual 𝜇ℎ−𝜇𝑚 ≥ 8 %.  If the attrition rate at 1 year follow -up is < 20%, 
randomization  of [ADDRESS_618587] even smaller inter -group differences than quoted previously .  
 
Power Analysis/ Sample size C alculation for fMRI for Hypothesis 2.1 (Normative controls vs. urgency 
incontinence subjects): Regions of interest containing the insula and anterior cingulate cortex will be analyzed 
in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_481514] a priori hypothesis using two way ANCOVA with group as the between subject’s factor and 
age as a covariate. Pre -treatment β weights for both bladder filling and urgency regressor effect on anterior 
cingulate cortex and insula signal among normative subjects will be compared to the effect on signal in urgenc y 
incontinence subjects. The planned study size allows detection of differences between groups with an effect size 
>0.[ADDRESS_618588] size observed in our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Cohen’s d ra nged from 0.8 to 1.5) suggests that the study will be adequately powered (greater than 
0.8) to reject the null hypothesis at an alpha=0.05. In addition to analysis of prior regions of interest, group wise 
whole brain contrast will also be performed using a n identical statistical model. False positives will be corrected 
at a significance threshold corresponding to p <.005 applied in combination with a minimum cluster size threshold 
of 32 native voxels (p < 0.05), parameters derived from 10,[ADDRESS_618589] size in our preliminary data (>3 ) 
suggests that the sample size used for proposed analysis of evoked potentials will be more than adequate.  
Although the principal purpose of this analysis is to further explore the pathophysiologic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_481515], we will also explore the use of evoked potentials and functional connectivity as a biomarker for 
UUI. Towards that end we will construct receiver operator curves (ROCs) based on fMRI output from controls 
and patients with UUI.  
 
Statistical Analysis 2.[ADDRESS_618590] -Treatment measurements in patients with UUI :  Prior functional MRI 
analysis during the hypnotic state has shown complete suppression of anterior cingulate cortex activation in 
response to pain.[ADDRESS_618591] size would be approximately equivalent to a 60% decrease in the excess (above normative control) anterior 
cingulate cortex and insula signal. We predict a main effect of time, suggesting that both treatments are effective 
in reducing activity withi n the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. However, we also predict a significant Group 
x Time interaction, indicating that that change in activity will be greater for the hypnotherapy relative to the 
pharmacotherapy group. Minimum detectable effect size for the Group X Time interaction is 0.[ADDRESS_618592] size of >[ADDRESS_618593] size would be 
reach ed with a 15% decrement in anterior cingulate cortex to insula connectivity. As for evoked activity we predict 
both a main effect of time, and predict a significant Group x Time interaction, indicating that change in functional 
connectivity will be greater  for the hypnotherapy relative to the pharmacotherapy group. Minimum detectable 
effect size for the Group X Time interaction is 0.[ADDRESS_618594] size 
will be reached when between group differences in anterior cing ulate cortex to insula connectivity are ≥ 30%.  
        
The principal purpose of this analysis will be to explore the mechanism of action of hypnotherapy when used to 
treat UUI, using pharmacotherapy as a control treatment that is not expected to exert its  therapeutic effect via 
the brain. In addition we will explore the utilization of evoked activity and functional connectivity as biomarkers 
by [CONTACT_481590], specifically UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
We und erstand that there is currently insufficient literature to determine the optimal method of assessing this 
correlation in the setting of a non -inferiority study design, and will look towards OCRA guidance on this aspect 
of the analytic plan in the future.  
 
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Randomization to treatment  
Study participants will be randomized to either pharmacotherapy or hypnotherapy groups using a computer -
generated randomization scheme in varying permuted block sizes of 4 -8.  SAS 9.3® Proc-Plan so ftware will 
create a randomization scheme of varying permuted block sizes of 4 -8 to avoid severe inequality of group sizes 
for this 2 arm study. Subjects will be stratified based on fMRI performance and UUI severity (< 4 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481516]. ≥ 4 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] o n 3 day voiding diaries). UUI severity should be comparable in both groups because it is 
a potential risk factor for treatment failure. UUI severity will be defined by [CONTACT_481591]. Burgio83 identified risk 
factors for unsuccessful behavioral treatment of  UUI. Women with > [ADDRESS_618595] is initiated; he will have no patient contact, r esearch personnel will not disclose unique patient identifiers to 
him, and he will remain blinded to patient randomization until study completion. Trial randomization codes will 
be maintained by [CONTACT_481592]. Clifford Qualls (who is uninvolved with stud y analysis) will have the ability 
to break the blind. Breaking blinding is planned when all subjects in the RCT (N=152) have completed [ADDRESS_618596], study personnel performing data entry and the study statistician wil l be 
blinded to knowledge of subjects’ treatment groups. Investigator blinding will only be breached if a subject 
suffers an unexpected clinical event and investigator knowledge of the subject’s treatment is essential to 
providing standard of care. Subject s cannot be blinded to treatment interventions as it will be obvious to them 
whether or not they are undergoing hypnotherapy or taking medications.  
 
 
 
 
9.3 Definition of Populations (ITT versus Per Protocol)  
Intention to Treat:  
    
[ADDRESS_618597] baseline 
efficacy assessments . Subjects who are missing, non -compliant or who us e off-protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481517]. For the primary analysis, any missing observations will 
be treated as missing at random.  We will also use both parametric mixed models and longitudinal semi -
parametric regression model to explore and compare differences over time of urinary incontinent epi[INVESTIGATOR_481518]:  
A secondary analysis for the RCT will be a per protocol analysis, evaluating outcomes for subjects based on  
therapy compliance and use of off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481519]-adherence/Non -Compliance to treatment protocol at 2 month follow -up of the study:  
Definition Non -adherence/Non -Compliance:  
 Medication gr oup: Subjects state ‘no’ on the Pharmacotherapy Compliance form (question 
#1) that they are no longer ta king their medications at 2 month follow -up 
 Attendance of < 60% of hypnotherapy appointments  
Measures taken to improve non -adherence during 1st 12 week s of the study: Data on adherence to the treatment 
protocol will be collected weekly during the treatment phase of the study by [CONTACT_481593]. Data on adherence will be reviewed at each of the DSMB meetings (described above) . Adherence of 
participants randomized to medications will be evaluated by [CONTACT_481594] #1 on the 
Pharmacotherapy Compliance form (see above). Available data on the use of anti -cholinergics for urgency 
urinary incontinence suggests an  overall non -compliance or withdrawal rate of 30% in randomized controlled 
trials and rates below 45% at 1 month and 13% at 1 year in clinical practice. If average adherence falls below 
the suggested rate of 60% a conference call will occur for study inves tigators to discuss methods for improving 
adherence without affecting the integrity of the study. However, given the data regarding anti -cholinergic side 
effects, it is quite possible that this non -adherence rate is not changeable. Protocol adherence in su bjects 
randomized to hypnotherapy will be measured by [CONTACT_481569][INVESTIGATOR_481520]. 
If adherence of hypnotherapy subjects falls below a suggested rate of less than 60%, a conference call for study 
personnel to discuss methods for improving treatment adherence will occur.   
 
Non-compliance/Non -Compliance or use of off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_193238] 6, 12 month follow -up visits  
Definition of Non -adherence/Non -Compliance at 6 & 12 month follow -up:  
 Medication group: Subjects state ‘no’ on the Pharmacotherapy Compliance (question #1) form that they 
are no longer taking their medications at 6 or 12 month follow -up 
 Hypnotherapy group: Subjects who state ‘no’ on the Hypnotherapy Compliance form (question #1) that 
they are not  listening to their hypnotherapy CDs or practicing self -hypnosis at 6 or 12 month follow -up  
 
Definition of use of off -protocol treatments  
 Subje cts use other treatments for UUI such as sacral neuromodulation, intravesical botox in the last 12 
months or other UUI medications (such as Toviaz®/Fesoterodine or Sanctura®/Trospi[INVESTIGATOR_481495]®/Solifenacin or Enablex®/Darifenacin or Myrbetriq®/Mirabegron ) 
 Subjects use acupuncture to specifically to treat UUI  
 Subjects use herbal remedies specifically to treat UUI  
 
Analysis of non -compliance or use of off -protocol treatments:   
Subjects who are non -compliant or use off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481521]. When subjects implement off -protocol therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], we will examine the sensitivity of 
the per protocol analyses in two ways.  First, we will modify the models to incorporate a time -varying treatment 
parameter that can be used to examine the effect of received treatment. Second, we will censor all 
measurements after they receive alternative treatment, and then impute all censored measurements using 
multiple imputations based on information collected fr om those who do not switch. Non -Compliance will be 
analyzed in the per -protocol analysis first as a categorical variable (yes/no) in its relationship to the outcome(s) 
    
43 
  and will then be evaluated as a continuous variable (i.e. times self -hypnosis practiced or CD/digital recording 
used) in its relationship to the outcome.  
 
Missing Data:  
 
Standard procedures will be used to ensure that data are as complete and accurate as possible. In order to 
decrease missing data, data collection forms will be designed for r ecording measurements and the Redcap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture) System, as recommended by [CONTACT_481595], will be used by [CONTACT_481596]. Study personnel will check the data collection forms for completeness before study 
participants leave the clinic so that missing clinical information may be addressed while study participants are 
still in the clinic. Downloads will be performed to check for missing values and skipped entries using SAS®  
programming and will be designed to av oid skipped entries and allow flagging of missing data. Our goal is to 
maintain a loss to follow -up rate less than 10% though we will conservatively plan on a loss to follow -up rate of 
20%. Our goal is to maintain a missing data rate of less than 10% overa ll. 
 
We anticipate that missing data will be generated in two primary ways; 1) Small numbers of subjects may 
withdraw consent or be lost to follow -up and will not have any measurements after their withdrawal. In this case, 
the study will be missing all dat a and these will be censored observations. The missing data may fall across the 
spectrum from missing completely at random to missing not at random 2) Subjects may fail to provide data at a 
specific follow -up time due to unforeseen life -events (illness, fa mily emergencies) that do not allow them to 
provide assessments within the allowable window.  The missing data from this second group will follow an 
intermittent pattern. Again, the missing data may fall across the spectrum from missing completely at rando m to 
missing not at random   
 
We will use two general strategies for assessing the sensitivity of both primary and secondary analyses to 
missing at random and missing completely at random assumptions.  First, for individuals that withdraw from the 
study or  have missing visits, we will collect information on the reasons for those missed visits.  That information, 
coupled with data collected from earlier visits will be used to develop comparisons of the two treatment arms 
using pattern mixture models. For the  second approach, we will use multiple imputation based on a model 
conditional on baseline covariates, treatment group, and all previous measures. Separate imputation models will 
be used for the two groups.  
 
9.4 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_481522] a low risk study as both interventions are low risk; pharmacotherapy is a standard, accepted treatment of 
UUI and hypnotherapy is considered a low risk intervention as hypnosis can only occur in subjects who allow 
themselves to be hy pnotized (i.e. the hypnotic state cannot be forced upon individual). Nonetheless, in the 
unlikely event that the following situations occur, the study will be stopped prior to completion if: (1) any of the 
interventions are associated with SAEs attributabl e to the interventions that call into question the safety of the 
interventions (likelihood is extremely low) (2) difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact 
the ability to evaluate the study endpoints (likelihood is extremely low )  (3) any new information becomes 
available during the trial that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356] (likelihood is extraordinarily low).  
 
In the unlikely event that >33% of study subjects report that they experience serious emotional upset from study 
partic ipation the study will be suspended and a review will occur. Serious emotional upset includes inability to 
work or events that would necessitate evaluation by a physician or care provider. It is unlikely that this will occur 
as we have had 0/17 subjects in  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_481523]. However, it is highly unlikely that hypnotherapy could 
potentially unmask or de -repress significant emotional upset (e.g. hyste ria, uncontrollable anger or hostility) in 
subjects. The potential for this occurring will be minimized by [CONTACT_42792] a history of schizophrenia 
or untreated bipolar disorder and by [CONTACT_481597][INVESTIGATOR_481524]. A report of a subject experiencing 
serious emotional upset from study participation will result in a meeting of the PIs and review of the issues 
surrounding its occurrence.  The PIs and Study coordinator will generate a report, assess whether it was 
    
[ADDRESS_618598] not reported this occurring; however, we believe that it is prudent 
to consider this as a possibility and to prepare for it as a possibility, although highly unlikely. The study would 
also be stopped if there were statistically significant differences in SAEs (as defined in section 7.3) definitely 
attributable to the interventions (hypnoth erapy or pharmacotherapy). The medications in the pharmacotherapy 
arm, considered standard of care treatments, have undergone rigorous FDA approval, and it would be highly 
unlikely that these events would occur.

9.51 Primary Outcome  
Specific Aim 1:  Determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is as, or is more effective and durable, 
in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) than a non -mind/body treatment ( pharmacotherapy)  
 
The primary outcome  for the analysis of Objective 1 will be change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_264041] 3 day voiding 
diaries for the hypnotherapy group compared to the pharmacotherapy  group at 2 month follow -up (See flow 
Diagrams Section 5. “Study I nterventions”)  
 
Specific Aim 2 : Determine whether hypnotherapy treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence) is associated 
with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI than that which occurs following 
pharmacotherapy.  
Hypothesis 2.2 .  Among patients with urgency incontinence, hypnotherapy will decrease hyper -activation of the 
limbic cortex in response to bladder distension and/or modulate functional connectivity within the limbic system.  
Moreover, normalization of hype r-activation and connectivity will be greater in hypnotherapy compared to 
pharmacotherapy  
 
The primary outcome  is to evaluate whether UUI subjects treated with hypnotherapy have decreased hyper -
activation of the limbic cortex (ACC and insula) in response t o bladder distention and/or modulation in functional 
connectivity within the limbic cortex in response to bladder distension compared to subjects treated with 
pharmacotherapy. This will be obtained after the subjects finish their 8 weeks of either pharmaco therapy or 
hypnotherapy (Visit 12; see flow Diagrams Section 5. “Study Interventions’)  
 
9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
Specific Aim 1:  Determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is as, or is more effective and durable, 
in treating urgency urinary incon tinence (UUI) than a non -mind/body treatment (pharmacotherapy)  
 
This Aim’s primary outcome:  will be to compare between group difference in change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 2 months. 
Secondary outcomes  will be to; determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnothera py) is as, or is more 
effective and durable, in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) than a non -mind/body treatment 
(pharmacotherapy) comparing change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 6 and 12 months as well as comparing between group 
changes in urinary frequency  and pad counts recorded on 3 day voiding diaries at 2,6 and 12 months, difference 
in “cure” in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (defined as complete resolution of UUI, i.e. 0 UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], on voiding diaries at 2,6 
and 12 months) and “durable cure” (defined as complete resol ution of UUI on all follow -up voiding diaries at 2, 6 
and 12 months), differences in expectation attainment (i.e. between group differences in follow -up Expectation 
question) and differences in questionnaire change scores [OAB -q SF, ISI, Global (PPBC) ques tionnaire scores 
and change in sexual function based on PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12 scores].  Additionally, we will evaluate the baseline occurrence 
of concomitant syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome and painful bladder syndrome in this population of 
    
45 
  women with UUI bas ed on the medical history and CRADI -8 and IBS Module and IC questionnaires. We will 
explore whether there is a difference in pain and IC symptoms following treatment if there are sufficient numbers 
of women with  bowel abnormalities and IC at baseline.  
 
Specific Aim 2 : Determine whether hypnotherapy treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence) is associated 
with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI than that which occurs following 
pharmacotherapy.  
Hypothesis 2.1 . Patients with urgency urinary incontinence will exhibit increased activation within portions of the 
limbic cortex (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) during bladder distension relative to healthy controls. Patients 
will also exhibit an abnormal pattern of  functional connectivity within the limbic system.  
 
This Aims’ secondary outcome  will be to evaluate differences in brain activation of the limbic cortex and brain 
connectivity at baseline between women with UUI and normative controls.  
 
9.6 Data Analyses  
 
Specific Aim 1:  Determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is as, or is more effective and durable, 
in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) than a non -mind/body treatment (pharmacotherapy)  
 
Statistical Analysis : Improvement between hypnot herapy and controls will be compared at baseline and follow -
up at 2, 6, 12 months. Because of the possibility that a number of subjects may be cured (i.e. report “0” urgency 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) at follow -up on voiding diary, we will use a zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) generalized linear 
mixed model for the analysis and compare groups’ urgency incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  The ZIP model analysis is 
proposed because the data are expected to be relatively low counts with the potential of a large numbers of 
zeroes, p articularly at [ADDRESS_618600] the discrete nature of the data (“cures” become 100 percent change rather than 0 UUI 
count at 2 months), and standard least squa res methods will not be appropriate.  If there is no inflation at 0, i.e. 
standard Poisson regression is appropriate, then the associated log -linear model yields percent change as a 
natural parameter (by [CONTACT_481598]).  If there is signi ficant inflation at 0, the confidence interval 
for percent change in the mean will be constructed by [CONTACT_481599], and checked via bootstrap methods. We will be able to derive mea n UUI 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_481525] % change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481526]. All other parameters, which 
are normally distributed or continuous variables, will be compared using a linear mixed model analysis. It is 
unlikely that there will baselin e differences between groups, given that this is a randomized controlled trial. If 
baseline differences between groups are found (e.g. incontinence duration, coexisting illnesses, prior treatment), 
appropriate variables will be added to the analysis as cov ariates. We will include pre -treatment patient 
expectations and hypnotic susceptibility as covariates in the analysis and determine if they are independent 
predictors of treatment response. We will not exclude subjects based on hypnotic susceptibility to i ncrease the 
generalizability of our findings. We anticipate subjects’ pre -treatment expectations will be an independent 
predictor of improvement in urgency incontinence & questionnaire scores (the previously determined sample 
size is adequately powered to find a relatively small partial R2 of .0513 between expectations and outcomes). The 
primary outcome measure will be change in UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481527] -up with a between group 
comparison, and not “cure”. However, the term “cure” may be used for secondary analyses. As such, our 
definition of “cure” will be: absence of UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_481528] 2, 6 and 12 month follow -up.  
Primary analyses will be performed using intention to treat. A per protocol analysis will also be performed;  those 
who did not comply with the study interventions, extensively used other concomitant treatments known to 
improve UUI (e.g. used other UUI medications, underwent sacral neuro -modulation), or missed multiple 
treatment sessions will be considered to hav e been off protocol subjects. Similar analyses will be performed 
comparing group differences in change in questionnaire scores while accounting for covariates such as 
pain/interstitial cystitis (based on VAS pain scale and IC questionnaire) or bowel abnorm alities (based on the 
CRADI -8), medical history and demographic variables (based on the medical history and demographic sheets) 
on the outcomes.

  Specific Aim 2:  Determine whether hypnotherapy treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence) is associated 
with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI than that which occurs following 
pharmacotherapy.  
Hypothesis 2.1. Patients with urgency urinary incontinence will exhibit increased activation within portions of the 
limbic c ortex (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) during bladder distension relative to healthy controls. Patients 
will also exhibit an abnormal pattern of functional connectivity within the limbic system.  
Hypothesis 2.2.  Among patients with urgency incontine nce, hypnotherapy will decrease hyper -activation of the 
limbic cortex in response to bladder distension and/or modulate functional connectivity within the limbic system.  
Moreover, normalization of hyper -activation and connectivity will be greater in hypno therapy compared to 
pharmacotherapy.  
 
Statistical Analysis of 2.1 Normative controls vs. urgency incontinence subjects: Regions of interest containing 
the insula and anterior cingulate cortex will be analyzed in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_481514] a priori hypothesis using t wo way 
ANCOVA with group as the between subject’s factor and age as a covariate. Pre -treatment β weights for both 
bladder filling and urgency regressor effect on anterior cingulate cortex and insula signal among normative 
subjects will be compared to the e ffect on signal in urgency incontinence subjects. The planned study size allows 
detection of differences between groups with an effect size >0.[ADDRESS_618601] size observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Cohen’s d ranged from 0.8 to 1.5) 
suggests that the study will be adequately powered (greater than 0.8) to reject the null hypothesis at an 
alpha=0.05. In addition to analysis of prior regions of interest, group wise whole brain contrast will also be 
performed using an identical statistical model. False positives will be corrected at a significance threshold 
corresponding to p <.005 applied in combination with a minimum cluster size threshold of 32 native voxels (p < 
0.05), parameters derived f rom 10,[ADDRESS_618602] size in  our preliminary data (>3) suggests that the sample 
size used for proposed analysis of evoked potentials will be more than adequate.  
Although the principal purpose of this analysis is to further explore the pathophysiologic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_481515], we will also explore the use of evoked potentials and functional connectivity as a biomarker for 
UUI. Towards that end we will construct receiver operator curves (ROCs) based on fMRI output from controls 
and patients with UUI.  
 
Statistical Analysis 2.[ADDRESS_618603] -Treatment measurements in patients with UUI : Efficacy of hypnotherapy 
and pharmacotherapy on anterior cingulate cortex and right insula activation will be compared using a 2x2 (Group 
x Time) mixed model ANCOVA to correct for potential dif ferences in group characteristics (e.g. age). Analysis of 
treatment effect will be focused on the anterior cingulate cortex and insula based on preliminary data that 
suggests the effect size for change in activation will be highest in these regions. Prior functional MRI analysis 
during the hypnotic state has shown complete suppression of anterior cingulate cortex activation in response to 
pain.[ADDRESS_618604] size 
would be approximately equivalent to a 60% decrease in the excess (above normative control) anterior cingulate 
cortex and insula signal. We predict a main effect of time, suggesting that both treatments are effective in 
reducing activity within the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Howeve r, we also predict a significant Group x 
Time interaction, indicating that that change in activity will be greater for the hypnotherapy relative to the 
pharmacotherapy group. Minimum detectable effect size for the Group X Time interaction is 0.7 with power  of 
0.8 and alpha of 0.05. Simple effects tests will also be conducted to ensure that randomization to treatment arm 
was successful (i.e. no differences in baseline activity across the two groups).  
Similar analyses will be conducted to evaluate the effect  of treatment on functional connectivity. No prior data is 
available in the literature regarding the expected change in waking state connectivity following hypnotherapy. 
Current study size will be able to detect within -group differences between pre and pos t treatment signal with a 
minimal effect size of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_618605] size of >[ADDRESS_618606] size would be reached with a 15% decrement in anterior cingulate cortex to 
insula c onnectivity. As for evoked activity we predict both a main effect of time, and predict a significant Group x 
Time interaction, indicating that change in functional connectivity will be greater for the hypnotherapy relative to 
the pharmacotherapy group. Min imum detectable effect size for the Group X Time interaction is 0.[ADDRESS_618607] size will be reached when between group differences in anterior 
cingulate cortex to insula connectivity are ≥ 30%.  
The principal pu rpose of this analysis will be to explore the mechanism of action of hypnotherapy when used to 
treat UUI, using pharmacotherapy as a control treatment that is not expected to exert its therapeutic effect via 
the brain. In addition we will explore the utili zation of evoked activity and functional connectivity as biomarkers 
by [CONTACT_481590], specifically UUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
We understand that there is currently insufficient literature to determine the  optimal method of assessing this 
correlation in the setting of a non -inferiority study design, and will look towards OCRA guidance on this aspect 
of the analytic plan in the future.  
 
Anticipated/Expected Outcomes: Results from this study should confirm th e differences between normative and 
urgency incontinence subjects with respect to limbic system evoked activation and functional connectivity. 
Confirmation of abnormal functional connectivity in urgency incontinence subjects during the resting state would 
be a particularly important contribution to the study of functional disorders in general. Abnormal resting 
connectivity data does not require that data be acquired and temporally linked to a performance of a task while 
in the MRI scanner making data acquis ition less technically demanding. Abnormal resting connectivity has thus 
far only been observed in fibromyalgia but if shown to be more widely present among functional disorders could 
prove a diagnostic tool and/or target of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Demonstration th at hypnotherapy’s impact on brain 
activation and connectivity extends past the hypnotic state and persists during wakefulness would allow 
treatment effects of hypnotherapy, and perhaps other mind/body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], to be assessed temporally distant 
from the t ime of therapy. The delayed assessment should give much better insight into the likelihood of a durable 
clinical benefit for the patient. Demonstration that hypnotherapy has greater impact on functional MRI  
findings than pharmacotherapy would argue that r esultant brain plasticity is related to mind -body therapy rather 
than due to altered sensory input (from the bladder).  
 
10. Data Collection and Quality Assurance  
 
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
The Study Coordinator and her designee (neither of whom will perf orm data entry) will collect baseline 
information from subjects including Past medical history & Demographics sheet & baseline questionnaires (OAB -
qSF, ISI, PBBC, PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -12, CRADI -8, IBS Module, BPIC, Expectation questionnaires administered) and 2, [ADDRESS_618608] numbers, date and HRPO study # and CRF version 
numbers. The research staff responsible for data entry into the database will be blinded to subject randomization. 
The research n urse performing Cystometrics and fMRI tasks will not be involved in the fMRI interpretation. Drs. 
Mayer and Ketai, who will perform fMRI interpretation, will be blinded to subject randomization.  
 
During this study all medical history , physical exam infor mation, testing results and questionnaires obtained at 
baseline and follow -up will be for research purposes only and data will be kept in strict confidence and will be 
identified with a study code number unique to the subject without other patient identifi ers. The database will be 
secured with password protection. The database will be built using the web -based platform, REDCap®, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_481600]. The study’s data entry personnel will receive only coded information that is 
entered into the data base under those identification numbers. Only coded information without unique patient 
identifiers will be entered into the study database. Only study personnel will have access to individually 
identifiable private information and data. Confidentiality wil l be maintained by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_481529] -based study subject 
folders for all enrolled subjects in a locked cabinet in the Urogynecology research area (this folder will include 
case report forms, laboratory reports, questionnaires, voiding diaries, intake forms). A  separate log linking patient 
codes and unique patient identifiers will be kept on password protected computer available to study personnel.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
[ADDRESS_618609] protected. The database will be built us ing the web -based 
platform, REDCap®, as recommended by [CONTACT_481600]. The study’s data entry personnel will receive only 
coded information that is entered into the database under those identification numbers. Only coded information 
without unique patient id entifiers will be entered into the study database. Only study personnel will have access 
to individually identifiable private information and data. Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_481529] -based 
study subject folders for all enrolled subjects in  a locked cabinet in the Urogynecology research area (this folder 
will include case report forms, laboratory reports, questionnaires, voiding diaries, intake forms). Consents will be 
kept separate from these research folders and will be kept in a separate locked cabinet in the UNM Research 
Administrative area. A separate log linking patient codes and unique patient identifiers will be kept on password 
protected computer available only to study personnel.  CRFs will include forms used to collect subject info rmation 
including demographic, medical history forms, questionnaires, compliance forms, fMRI screening forms, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria forms as well as patient behavioral therapy instruction handouts.  
 
Data collected at the Mind Research Network us ing standardized paper forms or digitally will only be identified 
with the study’s unique identifier (ID) for the participant. The link between the name [CONTACT_481619] [CONTACT_481601] a secure portal. All data s torage devices at the Mind Research 
Network are encrypted devices. Personally identifying information will not be stored in files on networked 
computers and paper forms. Such information will be kept in separate locked file cabinets. Electronic data are 
doubly protected against computer catastrophe. Data will be backed up daily. The backup system will be used 
only by a designated administrator, preventing accidental deletion even by [CONTACT_60551].  
 
10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1 Training  
Research Study Staff  all complete training as required by [CONTACT_481602] (these include; Research University workshop 
for Human Research Protections Office submissions, Human Research Protections training certification, UNM 
Financial Conflicts of Interest training, UNM  Health Scienc es Center  Culture of Compliance, UNM Health 
Sciences Center Code of Conduct and Compliance, HIPAA and Breach Notification,  HIPAA Training, HIPAA 
and Accounting of Disclosure, Cash Management Trainings and Ethics training (Ethics: A Framework for Ethical 
Decision Making). In completing these training classes, research staff acknowledge the rules and regulations 
regarding human subjects protection, HIPAA regulations compliance, and all University -related policies and 
procedures governing research.   These cla sses provide  each  coordinator with the tools  to effectively and 
efficiently execute research protocols and maintain compliance with federal, state, and university regulations. In 
addition, the Research Information Specialist has completed the following tra ining: Certified Clinical Research 
Coordinator (for certification), Essentials of Leadership’, Patient Scheduling and the 2011 NIH Regional Grants 
Seminar.  Each employee's training profile is reviewed annually with the Research Information Specialist to 
assure compliance with federal, state, and university guidelines.    
 
Training for the medication counselor(s) will include [ADDRESS_618610] the following quality control metrics:  
RCT outcomes:  
1. Research study members who distribute and evaluate the voiding diary(s) will complete a training and 
certification process and random audits will be performed by [CONTACT_481603]’s 
interpretations. See MOP “Voiding Diary Guidelines”  
    
49 
  2. Research study members who  distribute the treatment compliance and expectation questions will be 
trained and certified on their administration and interpretation and random audits will be performed by 
[CONTACT_481603]’s interpretations.  
3. The OAB -qSF15, ISI, the global q uestionnaire (PPBC),10,[ADDRESS_618611] 
format.  
FMRI outcomes: BOLD -related evoked activity and functional connectivity maps  will both undergo extensive QA 
procedure  
1.  The transformation matrix registering each subject's functional data to structural space will be visualized 
for accuracy (for both the evoked and resting state data)  
2. Raw images will be examined for excessive motio n as well as artifacts. In addition, the degree of motion 
will also be quantified for each individual based on the first two statistical moments from the cohort using 
previously published algorithms at the end of the study [ADDRESS_618612] basis.  
 
10.3.4 Protocol Deviations  
Data on adherence to the treatment protocol will be collected weekly during the treatment phase of the study by 
[CONTACT_361335]. Data on adherenc e will be reviewed at each of the DSMB 
meetings (described above). Adherence of participants randomized to medications will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_481604] 2,  6 and 12 months for the pharmacotherapy 
group.  Available data on the use of anti -cholinergics for urgency urinary incontinence suggests an overall non -
compliance or withdrawal rate of 30% in ran domized controlled trials and rates below 45% at 1 month and 13% 
at 1 year in clinical practice.54,21 If average adherence falls below the suggested rate of 60%, a conference call 
will occur for study investigators to discuss methods for improving adherenc e without affecting the integrity of 
the study. However, given the data regarding anti -cholinergic side effects, it is quite possible that this non -
adherence rate is not changeable. Protocol adherence in subjects randomized to hypnotherapy will be measured  
by [CONTACT_481569][INVESTIGATOR_481530], then review of compliance will be followed at 2, 6, and 12 months based on the compliance to 
hypnotherapy treatment forms. If adherence of hyp notherapy subjects falls below a suggested rate of less than 
60% in the active treatment phase of the study, a conference call for study personnel to discuss methods for 
improving treatment adherence will occur.   
A protocol deviation form will be complete d by [CONTACT_481605], for any 
event which occurs or is performed outside the study protocol. Protocol deviations include missed visits, 
incomplete visit assessments, informed consent -randomization deviations, errors in  eligibility assessments, and 
study treatments. Treatment protocol deviations (e.g. off -protocol treatments) will be captured and documented 
on the Hypnotherapy Compliance and Pharmacotherapy Compliance forms that will be administered to subjects 
at their 2, 6 and 12 month follow -up. These will be reviewed by [CONTACT_32366] (in the aggregate without 
individual identifiers to identify the frequency of occurrence) and will be reported to the DSMB at all their regularly 
scheduled meetings. Reporting of prot ocol deviations will follow UNM HRPO guidelines.  
 
10.3.5 Monitoring  
Description of Plan for Data Quality and Management and Data Collection Forms ―The study staff under the 
over site of the PIs will review all data collection forms on an ongoing basis for d ata completeness and accuracy 
as well as protocol compliance. Data verification will be performed by [CONTACT_481606] 10% of data collected. Data quality control metrics will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_5051]. The results of the data review will be incorporated into the reports for each DSMB meeting 
and in the Annual Report. The research team will be responsible for data collection and management for the 
project. Only the research team will have a ccess to the data. Information will be collected by [CONTACT_481607]’s which will be considered source data. Data collection forms which 
have been developed prior to study initiation will be maintained as part of Goo d Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Research coordinator will review data collection forms for completeness. Data will be de -identified after the data 
is labeled with a participant code number. Study folders will be kept in a locked cabinet (see Database Protection  
above) only available to the study personnel. The study folders with data collection forms will be de -identified. 
Direct patient identifiers will be linked to the patient’s code number log (or ‘data link’) kept separately from the 
study folders; the link is necessary in the event that the subject needs to be contact[CONTACT_52911] (see Database

  Protection).Information with patient identifiers such as informed consent forms and HIPAA authorizations will be 
kept separate from the study folders in a secured area.  
Frequency of Data Review for this Study― The frequency of data review for this study differs according to the 
type of data and is summarized in the following Table. The Reviewers will include the PIs, Study Coordinator 
and the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
 
11. Participant rights and Confidentiality  
11.[ADDRESS_618613] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_481608] (HRPO).  
 
11. [ADDRESS_618614] at study entry. Informed consent will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_38733]:  
1) Subjects will be asked if they are interested in study participation in a private setting, and if they verbalize 
interest, a copy of the consent forms will be explained and given to them to review so that they may 
discuss the study with family and friends.   
2) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Is will meet with subjects to review the form and confirm the subject’s understanding of the 
study and to answer their questions. Subjects will answer screening questions to ensure they are 
appropriate candidates for the study.  
3) If subjects state that they are interested in study participation after explanation of the study as noted 
previously, an appointment will be made for subjects to return to sign the consent and fill out the baseline 
information and questionnaires.  
4) If they state that t hey are not certain, they will be given the study coordinator’s contact [CONTACT_481570]; a study appointment will be made 
for subjects to return to sign the consent after they con tact study personnel.   
5) At the enrollment appointment, which occurs in a private setting, subjects sign the consent after study 
personnel are certain that subjects have had appropriate counseling and understanding regarding the 
study and that the study and consent have been explained to them in a fashion congruent with their 
medical literacy. Consent will be obtained after screening is performed and will be re -reviewed in the 
future in the event changes are required. In general, consent will be obtained at t he baseline visit. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Is, Study Coordinator(s) or Study Nurse(s) will obtain verbal and written informed consent on an 
IRB approved consent after explaining study and before collecting any data. Human subject’s protection 
will follow local and na tional regulations at all times.

measures taken to ensure that individuals unders tand the study and their roles as study subjects, and all subjects 
will be given appropriate time to decide whether or not they want to participate in the study. Subjects unable to 
give their own informed consent wil l not be enrolled in the study. The cons ent form describes the purpose of the 
study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. A copy will be given to each 
study  participant and this will be documented in the participant’s record.  In order to be comply with  UNMHSC 
IRB regulations  regarding potential future studies and analyses of findings and NIH directives regarding public 
access to NIH -funded databases, participants will be asked to sign an optional consent addendum for storage 
and use of data for future s tudies  as this study has now completed enrollment . Data will be stored as outlined in 
section 10.2, and as stated in that section information in the database is de -identified with only research numbers 
used.  
 
 
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
The plan to ensure protection of subjects’ privacy includes the following elements:  
Subjects will be asked if they are interested in study participation in a private setting, and if they verbalize interest, 
they will be given a copy of the consent forms to read. If t hey choose to participate, arrangements will be made 
for subjects to sign the consent in the presence of a study investigator in a private setting. All subjects will be 
reassured that declining study participation will have no effect on the clinical care t hat they receive. Researchers 
will ask subjects’ permission to review their medical records and record study findings (e.g. answers to the 
questionnaires, the standardized pelvic exam, cystometric results, voiding diary results, functional MRI results). 
No information will be given to anyone without the subject’s permission; a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization Consent will be obtained from the patient as required by [CONTACT_481609] (HRPO). The investi gators and the consents guarantee subject confidentiality, as required 
and substantiated in the University of New Mexico HRPO (IRB) study consents which further requires that all 
data will be identified with an identification code unique to the subject. Du ring this study all evaluations, medical 
history and physical exams and questionnaires and imaging results performed at baseline and follow -up will be 
for research purposes only and data will be kept in strict confidence. All data, whether generated in the  laboratory 
or on examinations will be identified with an identification code, a Participant ID (PID) otherwise referred to as a 
study number, unique to the subject. All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet. Information will not be 
released withou t written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_481610].  (Please also refer as well to the above sections; section 10.1 Data Collection forms and 10.2 Data 
Management).  
 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may  be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_481583] (IRB), the NCCAM or other government agencies 
as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.  
 
12. Committees  
Data Safety Monitoring Board (see section 7.6 and DSMP)  
 
13. Publication of Research Findings  
Publications of the results of this study will be determined by [CONTACT_481611] -Is of this study. Authorship will 
follow the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and require authorship credit 
based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and design and acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final 
approval of the version to be published. Authors will meet condition 1, 2, and 3.  
Final research data will be shared via abstract submission, presentation at appropriate research meetings and 
publications in peer reviewed journals. Manuscripts arising from this funding will be submitted to PubMed  Central 
upon acceptance for publications. Our project will register at Clinical trials.gov and the project design  will be 
publically available. Any presentation, abstract or manuscript will be made available for review by [CONTACT_481612].

Objective  
This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 1940 nm diode fractional 
laser handpi[INVESTIGATOR_488342], but not limited to lentigos (age 
spots), solar lentigos (sunspots) and ephelides (freckles).  
Background and Rationale  
The use of lasers to selectively target chromophores in the skin wa s first described by 
[CONTACT_488361] 1983.[ADDRESS_627364] been developed with 
wavelengths in the near to mid -infrared spectrum that are selectively absorbed by [CONTACT_488362]  a nonablative manner to 
coagulate structures of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_488344].  
Initially these nonablative lasers were used with a flat beam profile for skin resurfacing2.  
Starting in 2004, these technologies were followed by [CONTACT_488363] (NAF) lasers that deliver the energy to the skin as arrays of microscopic 
treatment zones (MTZs) for indications ranging from skin resurfacing, to treatment of 
wrinkles and fine lines, pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436], scars,  and other dermatological 
indications.3,4,5,6,7,[ADDRESS_627365] discrete 
microscopic zones of thermal epi[INVESTIGATOR_488345].  This energy delivery technique allows for les s healing time compared to traditional flat 
beam laser treatments.   
Study Design  
This study is a prospective, open -label, clinical trial to study the effects of the FRAX 1940 
nonablative, fractional 1940 nm wavelength diode laser for treatment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_350469] d lesions.  
Secondarily, textural improvement of the treated area (s) will be assessed.  
Up to [ADDRESS_627366] treatment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_488346] 5) investigational sites.  After meeting all inclusion crite ria and not 
meeting any of the exclusion criteria, as well as providing signed informed consent, a 
subject will be considered enrolled in the study and assigned a unique study identification 
number.  
 
Subjects will initially receive up to four (4) test spot s on the face, hands, arms, back, chest 
or legs using the FRAX [ADDRESS_627367] spot area will not be larger than 
approximately 2 inches by 2 inches (5 cm x 5 cm).     
 
Subjects will be scheduled for a follow -up visit at 4 ± 2 days (Follow -Up Visit #1) and 14 ± 7 
days (Follow -Up Visit #2) after the test spots.  Based o n the observed skin responses and 
healing seen at Follow -Up Visit #2, the Investigator or study staff will determine if a subject 
is an appropriate candidate to proceed with the full treatment of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436].  
The full treatment will be performed  immediately following Follow -Up Visit #[ADDRESS_627368]  2019

If it is determined by [CONTACT_80472] 14 ± [ADDRESS_627369] intake 
through final follow -up is shown in Figure 1 . 
 
Figure 1:  Study Flow Chart  
 
 
 
 
After receiving Treatment #1, subjects will be scheduled for a follo w-up visit for clinical 
evaluation and photography at 7 ± 3 days.  Treatment #2 will be scheduled 4 ± 1 weeks 
after Treatment #1 if skin assessment is acceptable; and Treatment #3 will be scheduled  
4 ± 1 weeks after Treatment #2.  Additional interim follo w-up visits may be required 
between treatment visits at the discretion of the Investigator or study staff to monitor the 
treated area(s), and possibly after final treatment if lingering adverse events need to be 
monitored to resolution.  
 
A follow -up visit  will be scheduled approximately 4 ± 1 weeks (1 month) after the final 
treatment (usually after Treatment #3).  
 
A final follow -up visit will be scheduled approximately 12 ± 1 weeks (3 months) after the 
final treatment (usually after Treatment #3).  
 
Note:  Subjects may undergo fewer than three treatments, as decided by [CONTACT_488364].

Subject Enrollment  
Once a qualifying subject is enrolled into the study, their visits will be scheduled as 
illustrated in the Study Flow Chart ( Figure 1 ) and study activities as described below.   
 
Screening and Baseline Visits  
Subjects will be evaluated against the inclusion and e xclusion criteria at the Screening Visit 
for eligibility to participate in the study.  
 
Eligible subject will be scheduled for a baseline visit during which they will be asked to read 
and sign the Informed Consent Form, receive a unique study identification  number, and 
receive their baseline photography.  The baseline visit may occur on the same visit as 
screening.  
 
FRX1900 [ADDRESS_627383] digital camera.  Flash photography is not 
required.  As the treatment areas may be directly on or near the face, photography may 
contain identifying features.   However, efforts will be made to de -identify images if used for 
scientific/research or promotional purposes.  
 
All subj ects must agree to have photography performed and released for research 
purposes since the photographs are used to assess the primary endpoint of the study.  
Additionally, subjects will be asked if their photographs can be released for commercial 
marketing  purposes.  
 
Test Spot and Treatment Procedures  
Prior to receiving treatments subjects will receive up to four (4) test spots at the Test Spot 
Visit.  The Investigator or study staff will deliver FRAX 1940 laser energy in or near the 
intended treatment area (s) as test spots to evaluate the reaction of the skin.  This helps the 
Investigator or study staff determine that the laser is set to a safe setting, or whether more 
or less energy should be used to achieve clinical endpoint, typi[INVESTIGATOR_488351].   
Each test spot area size will not exceed approximately [ADDRESS_627384] spots or treatment, the areas of the skin intended to be exposed to the 
laser energy may need to be shaved to avoid any influence of hairs absorbing the 
treatment laser energy.  
 
Some subjects may be offered anesthesia to minimize dis comfort during treatment in the 
form of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_488352]/prilocaine (EMLA), 
benzocaine/lidocaine/tetracaine (BLT), or similar product that would be applied [ADDRESS_627385] treatment parameters are also guided by [CONTACT_488365] (FST), location on the b ody, or other factors.  
If an appropriate clinical response is seen at 14 ± [ADDRESS_627386] spots (Follow -Up #2), 
then subjects will be scheduled to receive up to three (3) treatments of pi[INVESTIGATOR_488353], arms, back, chest, or legs.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_488354], but not be limited 
to, lentigos (age spots), solar lentigos (sunspots) and ephelides (freckles).  
 
Off-face treatment areas will be limited in size per the Investigator or study staff decision 
depending on factors including b ut not limited to practical treatment times, amount of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_80459], expected duration of anesthesia effect.  
 
The treatment(s) may occur during the same visit as the test spot Follow -Up #[ADDRESS_627387] may be 
scheduled for a subsequent follow -up visit after another 14 ± 7 days for re -evaluation (a 
total of 28 ± [ADDRESS_627388] spots).   Subjects who are still not exhibiting good 
candidacy for full study treatment at this subsequent visit will be exited from the study.  
Treatment will be avoided in the periorbital region, or directly on the lips.  Total treatment 
times wil l be noted on the appropriate CRF.  
Following test spots and each treatment, the study subjects will be asked to rate the 
amount of pain they may have experienced during their test spots or treatment on an  
11-point pain scale (0=No Pain to 10=Extreme Pain)  which will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) by [CONTACT_80476].  A sample of the 
Subject Reported Numerical Pain Scale to be used is provided in Appendix A.  
Following all test spots and treatments, the treated area wil l be examined and 
photographed, and immediate skin responses (Adverse Events) will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF.  
 
Appropriate post -treatment care instructions will be provided as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_80477].   
 
Suggested tre atment parameter ranges are provided in Table [ADDRESS_627389]  2019

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_488355] -up Visits: Test Spot  
  
Subjects will be scheduled to return for a follow -up visit 4 ± 2 days (Follow Up #1) after 
receiving their test spots in order to evaluate the skin response and have photography 
performed of the test spot areas.  It is anticipated that test spot areas will  exhibit the 
formation of MENDs at this visit.  
 
Subjects will also be scheduled to return for a follow -up visit 14 ± 7 days (Follow Up #2) 
after receiving their test spots in order to evaluate the skin response and have photography 
performed of the test sp ot areas.  It is anticipated that any MENDs observed at the prior 
visit will have begun to show resolution or disappearance at this visit, indicating healing of 
the skin and possibly clearance of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_488356].  If an appropriate clinical 
response is seen from the test spots at this visit, then subjects may proceed to receive up 
to three (3) treatments of their pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436].  
 
Subjects not showing adequate healing or adverse events at Follow Up #2 may be 
scheduled to return for a subsequ ent follow -up visit after an additional 14 ± 7 days (a total 
of 28 ± [ADDRESS_627391] spots).  After again evaluating the skin response and having 
photography performed of the test spot areas, the Investigator or study staff at this time 
point may  decide that a subject exit the study.  
     
Follow -up Visits: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_488357] a follow -up visit 7 ± 3 days after each treatment in 
order to evaluate skin response and perform photography of the treated area(s).  
 
Treated areas will also be evaluated just before receiving Treatment #2 and Treatment #3.  
 
Follow -up visits will be scheduled approximately 4 ± 1 weeks (1 month) and 12 ± 1 weeks 
(3 months) after the final treatment.  Note:   Fewer than three tre atments may be performed 
at the discretion of the Investigator or study staff due to adverse events or complete 
clearance of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_80461](s).

Study Endpoints  
 
Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
Improvement in the clearance of pi[INVESTIGATOR_488358] (3) blinded 
evaluators comparing photographs taken at Baseline and 1 Month Follow -Up (post final 
treatment) using a validated 5 -Point Pi[INVESTIGATOR_80430]:   
0 = 0% (No Improveme nt) to 4 = 75 -100% (Excellent Response).10 (Appendix D)  
 
Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint will be an analysis of the incidence and severity of the reported 
Adverse Events.  
 
Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints  
1. Blinded assessment of textural  improvement using a 5 -point Global Aesthetic 
Improvement Scale (GAIS) (1 = Very Much Improved, 5 = Worse) at the 1 month and 3 -
month follow -up visit (Appendix B).  
2. Subject assessment of improvement using a 5 -point Global Aesthetic Improvement 
Scale (GAIS) (1 = Very Much Improved, 5 = Worse) at the 1 month and 3 -month follow -
up visit (Appendix B).  
3. Subject satisfaction with treatment results will be characterized using a 5 -point scale  
(1 = Not Satisfied, 5 = Very Satisfied) at the 1 month and 3 -month follow -up visit 
(Appendix C).   
 
Subject reported pain during treatment as scored on an 11 -point scale (0=None, 10=  
Extreme) will be recorded after Test Spots and after each Treatment. (Appendix A)  
Study Data Analysis Methods  and Statistical Analysis Plan  
Safety will be evaluated on the Intent to Treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects 
enrolled, and will include a summary of the incidence, severity, and resolution of all 
reported adverse events. Clinical assessments wi ll be performed at each treatment and 
follow -up visit.  
 
Safety data analyses will be performed using Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, 
WA) or similar statistical software.  
Risks and Benefits  
Potential Risks  
The study treatments to be administered  in this trial carry risks of skin reactions that are 
anticipated or in some cases desired endpoints.  These skin responses are typi[INVESTIGATOR_80462], and transient in nature, resolving within a few days to a few weeks after 
treatment, and lo calized to the treated area(s).  Examples include edema, erythema, 
blanching, sloughing, and bronzing (transient darkening).   
 
An additional type of anticipated local skin response unique to nonablative fractional laser 
treatment is the formation of micro  epi[INVESTIGATOR_80435] (MENDs) which appear as 
FRX1900 [ADDRESS_627393] a few 
weeks.  
 
Examples of less common but potentially more severe or lingering adverse events may 
include blistering, burning, scarring, herpes simplex virus (HSV) activation, acne eruptions, 
telangiectasia formation, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_80464] -
inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (PIH) that persist beyond one month.  
 
There is a risk of eye injury associated with the use of the FRAX1940 laser.  This risk will 
be eliminated  by [CONTACT_488366].   
 
Potential Benefits  
There is no guarantee of a positive clinical result or any other benefit by [CONTACT_232642].  No significant clinical benefit is expected f rom receiving test spots.  However, 
subjects may experience improvement in the appearance of pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436].   
 
Adverse Events  
 
To evaluate safety of the FRAX1940 laser treatments, all adverse events, whether 
expected or less common, will be recorded and scored (see Tables 5 and 6 ) throughout 
the duration of the study.  Skin assessments will be performed at Baseline, immediately 
before and after each treatment, and at each follow ‐up visit.  All Adverse Events (AE) that 
occur in the study will be documented on the appropriate CRF.   
 
Anticipated adverse events as a result of laser treatment include edema, erythema, 
blanching, MENDs, sloughing, and bronzing (transient darkening).  Less common adverse 
events include blistering, burning, scarring, herpes simplex virus (HSV) activation, acne 
eruptions, telangiectasia formation, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_488359]-inflam matory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (PIH).  
 
All local skin responses and adverse events (AE) will be documented as required on the 
appropriate case report form.  The severity of AE will be scored using a numerical scale 
from 0 (none) to 4 (severe) as shown in Table 5 .  The relatedness of AE to study treatment 
will be scored using the relatedness scale as shown in Table 6  from 0 (unrelated) to 3 
(related), including a choice of U (unable to determine if related).  
 
Any Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) occurri ng during this study will be 
reported as soon as possible to the sponsor and IRB, but no later than [ADDRESS_627394] learns of the event as outlined in 21 CFR part 812.150(a)(1). 
However, the Sponsor requests that all Investigat ors notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_627395]  2019  
Page 18 of 24 degree of incidence in the application; or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse event that:  
a) led to death,  
b) resulted in life -threatening illness or injury  
c) resulted in permanent impairment of a body structure or body function  
d) resulted in int hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
e) resul ted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to 
body structure or body function, or  
f) led to fetal distress, fetal death, congenital abnormality or birth defect

Investigational Sites  
Up to four to five (4 -5) Investigational Sites may be included in this study after signed 
Clinical Trial Agreements are in place with the Sponsor, and IRB/EC approval for the study 
has been received.  
 
Investigational sites for this study will be identified by [CONTACT_80478] -qualified for 
participation prior to enrolling subjects in this study.  In -service training on all devices will be 
provided to delegated study personnel at each site prior to or at the time of study initiation.  
Study Monitoring  
It will be the responsibility of the Sponsor to develop and execute an adequate Monitoring 
Plan for this study.   Qualified personnel will be identified by [CONTACT_488367].  It is anticipated that three (3) monitoring visits per site should be 
adequate to ensure site compliance for this study, though additional visits may be 
scheduled at the discretion of the Sponsor.

Project Summary  
 
Justification for the project  
 
One half of all pregnancies among American women are unintended, with nearly 4 in 10 
ending in pregnancy termination by [CONTACT_500094] [22] .  Elective abortions are among the most 
common outpatient surgical procedure, with an estimated [ADDRESS_644081] majority of women will experience pain with the procedure [23] .   
Patients are most affected by [CONTACT_500095], cervical dilation, suction aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and post operatively with uterine crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [24] . Innovation in pain control and 
reduction of anxiety, nausea and vomiting using a low cost, well -tolerated intervention 
could impact thousands of women each year .   
Proposed research  
We plan a randomized controlled trial of gabapentin [ADDRESS_644082] 
 
1.1 Rational and objectives of the study  
 
1.1.1 Rationale  
 
Surgical abortions in North America are typi[INVESTIGATOR_500080], oral 
analgesics, moderate sedation, or a combination of approaches.  A 2009 Cochrane review of 
pain control during abortion concluded that evidence on paracervical block (PCB) alone in reducing abortion related pain was limited, while the addition of ibuprofen and naproxen can slightly reduce intraoperative and post- operative pain [1]  .  Evidence supports the 
benefit o f IV sedation  (moderate or deep) at reducing intraoperative and post- operative 
pain with abortion .[2] However, IV sedation may not be an option for all  women or in all 
clinical settings.  Other recently examined adjuncts to pain control have not proven to be 
beneficial at reducing abortion- related pain [3- 5]. 
 Gabapentin is widely used to treat neuropathic and chronic pain.  The mechanism of 
action may include calcium channel blockade or modulation o f nociceptive 
neurotransmitters.  Clinical trials support the use of perioperative pregabalin and 
gabapentin to reduce perioperative and post- operative pain in a variety of clinical settings, 
for both major and minor surgical procedures [6, 7] .  While pregabalin has a faster peak 
plasma concentration, gabapentin is a less expensive option with peak concentration 
reached by [ADDRESS_644083] thousands of women each year who undergo 
common outpatient gynecologic procedures.  We propose a novel use of oral gabapentin administered in conjunction with local anesthesia via PCB for surgical abortion.  The use of gabapentin in the setting of abortion has never been evaluated; however it is used 
routinely and successfully in several similar surgical settings  as an adjunct to pain 
management regimens.  It is generally well tolerated and inexpensive, with minimal side 
effects and few contraindications [8] .  When used in other gynecologic settings, gabapentin 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
has been shown to improve pain scores, and reduce nausea and vomiting [14,15].  If 
effective, this simple adjunct to current pain regimens could expand options for the management of women undergoing surgical abortion.  We believe that the addition of gabapentin given prior to the procedure will reduce intraoperative and post- operative 
pain.  Other secondary outcomes such as nausea, vomiting, and anxiety influence a woman’s ability to return to her normal baseline level activity and her experience of abortion in general.  The addition of gabapentin to current analgesia may provide an option to improve a woman’s experience during a surgical abortion.   Gabapentin 600mg was 
selected as a well -tolerated intermediate dosage with benefit proven in prior preoperative 
studies.  Multiple post- operative doses in addition to the pre- operative dose had no 
significant effect on VAS scores at 24 hours, thus favoring single dosage [9] .   
 
1.1.2 Objectives and hypotheses  
 
Pain control during and after abortion is a family planning research priority, as identified 
by [CONTACT_500096] [10] .  Pain management regimens for surgical abortion 
may include: local anesthetic, oral analgesics, moderate sedation, deep sedation, or a combination of approaches.  While several recent studies have evaluated supplemental 
medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_500081]- related pain, such as non- steroidal 
anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, anxiolytics, misoprostol, nitrous oxide, or 
music, most have failed to note improved pain scores.  Optimal pain management has yet to 
be established as many women continue to report moderate to severe pain during and after an abortion procedure [11] . 
We hypothesize that adding gabapentin pre- operatively to local anesthesia will 
reduce perioperative pain associated with surgical abortion.   Additionally, we hypothesize 
that pre -operative gabapentin will reduce perioperative nausea, vomiting, and anxiety, as 
well as reduce post -operative pain and consumption of pain medication with few adverse 
effects.

Primary Aim:  To evaluate the impact of adjunctive pre- operative gabapentin on 
intraoperative pain scores (at time of evacuation with the start of suction) during surgical 
abortion.  
Secondary Aims:  
 
• To evaluate the impact of pre- operative gabapentin on pa in scores post  operatively 
(removal of speculum , 10 and 30 minutes after procedure, at time of discharge and 
24 hours after procedure)  
• To evaluate the impact of pre- operative gabapentin on:  
o Perioperative nausea and vomiting  
o Perioperative anxiety  
• To evaluate the impact o f pre -operative gabapentin on perioperative medication 
consumption, and pain medication consumption up to 24 hours after the procedure  
• To evaluate safety of gabapentin in this setting  (monitor side effects or adverse 
events of gabapentin in this setting )

under local anesthesia.  Paracervical block (PCB) alone does not provide optimal pain 
control for all women.  Further, studies evaluating different concentrations of lidocaine or different methods of injection did not significantly reduce pain.  Pain with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_500082] 0.5% lidocaine with 1% lidocaine [1] .  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]- related or 
post -operative pain does not differ when comparing a four site paracervical block (3,5,7,9 
o’clock positions) to a two site block (4 and 8 o’clock positions) [12] .  Non -steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may be helpful in reducing pain for women receiving an abortion with PCB .  Ibuprofen 600 mg given 30 minutes prior to dilation and curettage 
slightly improved intraoperative pain scores with a mean pain difference of 7.8 mm  (on  100- mm scale)between the ibuprofen and placebo groups, but showed a more significant 
improvement (mean pain difference of 9.3 mm) in pain scores post- operatively  [13] .  The 
clinically meaningful significance of this difference is questionable.  Naproxen given 1 -2 
hours prior to surgery has also been shown to improve pain scores  [1].  Although NSAIDs 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
may improve pain with PCB, pain control is still often inadequate and some women may 
not be able to tolerate NSAIDs as they may develop gastrointestinal distress when given.  Intravenous (IV) moderate sedation has been shown to offer superior perioperative and post -operative pain control [1, 14]  compared to local anesthesia with  PCB ; however, 
patients may not be able to receive IV sedation due to the clinical setting, inability to find a means of transportation post- operatively, or may find IV sedation unacceptable . 
We propose a novel regimen of oral gabapentin administered in conjunction with 
local anesthesia via PCB for surgical abortion.  Gabapentin is used to treat neuropathic pain.  Clinical trials support the use of perioperative gabapentin to reduce perioperative and post- surgical pain in a variety of clinical settings [6] .  Gabapentin is well -tolerated and 
inexpensive, with mild, if any, side effects [8] .   In a systematic review of 22 randomized 
controlled trials (RCT) of multiple surgical procedures including ambulatory nasal surgery, orthopedic procedures and laparotomy, a singl e pre -operative dose of gabapentin 
significantly reduced 24 -hour opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] [8] .  Of the studies evaluating 
gabapentin use, 13 included a single dose of gabapentin, with doses ranging from 300 -
1200mg administered 1 -2 hours prior to surgery with results noting a 20 -62% reduction in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_500083] 24 hours after the procedure [8] .  In the setting of obstetrics 
and gynecology, evidence supports perioperative gabapentin before hysterectomy to 
reduce pain scores, nausea, and vomiting [9, 15] .  Following hysterectomy, the pain 
intensity difference between the control and gabapentin group was greatest in the early 
postoperative period, and decreased after 12 hours.  The dosages ranged from 400mg -1200mg, and the timing of dosing varied  (preoperative dose, followed my multiple dosing 
at interval times identified) [8].  In addition, VAS scores at 24 hours decreased from 9 -42.7 
to 2-25.3 mm  [9].  This study additionally found the significant reduction in VAS score was 
only noted with pre- operative administration while additional dosing was not associated 
with significant changes when compared to placebo.  Further, postoperative nausea and vomiting was also decreased by [CONTACT_094]- operative administration of gabapentin. H owever this 
may be due to decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] [9] .  
Preoperative gabapentin prior to cesarean delivery  improved pain scores at [ADDRESS_644085]- operative analgesia compared to placebo [15] .  A randomized 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
trial in the setting of cesarean delivery  showed improved pain scores and decreased pain 
medication requirements with a 600 mg dose of pre- operative gabapentin [15] .  In this 
study, patients presenting for scheduled cesarean delivery  were randomized to gabapentin 
or lactose placebo giv en 1 hour preoperatively.  Pain scores with movement were 
evaluated at 24 hours, with the gabapentin group reporting pain scores of 21  mm (95 % CI 
13-28) and the placebo group reporting scores of 41  mm (95% CI 31- 50).  Further, the 
gabapentin arm had higher maternal satisfaction scores [15] . 
In an outpatient setting similar to surgical abortion, perioperative gabapentin has 
been shown to decrease post- operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_500084] y [16, 17] .  One randomized trial evaluated 
gabapentin 600 mg at 2 hour(s) pr ior to arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
reconstruction [16] .  Average pain scores evaluated at 6 and 24 hours following 
reconstructive surgery confirmed that the g abapentin arm experienced significantly lower 
mean pain scores  (4.8 at 6 hours  on a 10cm scale ) in comparison to the placebo group  (6.9 
at 6 hours on a 10cm scale)  [16] . 
We propose a novel use of oral gabapentin administered in conjunction with 
paracervical block for surgical abortion, and believe that its use in this setting will reduce 
intraoperative and post -operative pain.   Gabapentin 600mg was selected as a well -
tolerated intermediate dosage with benefit proven in prior preoperative studies.  Multiple post -operative doses in addition to the pre- operative dose had no significant effect on VAS 
scores at 24 hours, thus favoring single dosage [9].  Gabapentin will be given 1- 2 hours  
preoperatively.  A 100- mm pain visual analog scale has been shown to be useful for the 
evaluation of pain in prior pain abortion research [7, 18] , with a 30% difference on a 100 
mm- VAS scale, or 13 -mm to 22- mm difference, as clinically meaningful [19, 20]  [25] .

numbers.  Allocation concealment will be maintained by [CONTACT_500097][INVESTIGATOR_223300].  Gabapentin and placebo will be packaged in identical  gelatin capsules and sealed by [CONTACT_500098]. Gabapentin and placebo 
gelatin capsules will be indistinguishable by [CONTACT_43463], thus maintaining double blinding .   
 
Primary study outcomes:   Our primary outcome measure will be pain score using a 100 -mm 
visual analog scale (VAS) measured intraoperatively at time of evacuation.  
 
Secondary outcomes:   We will also be measuring pain on the 100 -mm VAS preoperatively 
immediately prior to the procedure, at completion of the procedure (removal of the speculum), [ADDRESS_644087]- operative day 1 to assess pain, nausea, vomiting, side 
effects and general satisfaction with the procedure (on a 5 -point scale).  The quantity and 
type of medications used perioperatively and post- operatively, including medications used 
at home in the [ADDRESS_644088] -protected relational database (REDCap).  All VAS scale scoring and 
questionnaires will be completed using this database on a research -designated tablet.  
 
Baseline Characteristics and Covariates:    
We will collect baseli ne demographics,  medical histor y (gravidity, parity, prior abortions 
(medical and surgical), gestational age, drug and alcohol use, psychiatric or sexual assault history, medications used at home and given at the clinic preoperatively, and indication for procedure (personal/social, fetal, or maternal health).  This information will also be obtained using a research -designated tablet.  
Outcome measures and baseline variables are described in table 1.

1.3.2 Criteria for the selection of subjects  
 
Location:   
This study will take place at Atlanta Women’s 
Center (AWC), a free- standing abortion clinic 
in metro -Atlanta that offers abortion services 
to women up  to 23 weeks 6 days  gestation.  
This clinic operates 4 days per week 
(Wednesday through Sunday) with a clinical volume of [ADDRESS_644089]. Haddad is the medical director and the study will be conducted, has 
documented success in participating in and recruiting for several industry sponsored and investigator initiated research studies:  a randomized trial of levonorgestrel compared to Table 1: Outcome measures and covariates  
Primary outcome  
• Pain score validated on a 10 0mm VAS scale measured 
at time of start of uterine evacuation  
Secondary outcomes:

following procedure in the recovery room, at time of 
discharge  
• Medication use : pain and nausea medication used 
during and after procedure  
• Nausea/vomiting: pre op and post op nausea per VAS 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_114128]

ulipristal for emergency contraception (LIFE) study through Washington University in St. 
Louis, and a prospective cohort study of medical abortion through [ADDRESS_644090] -abortion contraception. 
 
Participation selection:  
Women who attend the AWC for an abortion will be approached during their preoperative 
evaluation to determine interest in participating in the study and if so, will be consented for the study and then screened for eligibility.  We will enroll a total of [ADDRESS_644091] a woman’s 
abortion pain experience.  
 The enrollment of participants is as follows:  
 Group A: This is the placebo group.  This group will receive local anesthesia per clinic protocol PLUS placebo 1- 2 hours preoperatively.  
Group B:  This is the gabapentin group.  This group will receive local anesthesia per clinic 
protocol PLUS Gabapentin 600mg 1-[ADDRESS_644092] on VAS scores at 24 hours, thus favoring  single 
dosage [9] .   
 
Power Calculation:   
A 100 -mm pain visual analog scale has been shown to be useful for the evaluation of pain in 
prior pain abortion research [7, 18] , with a 30% difference on a 100 mm -VAS scale, or 13 -
mm to 22 -mm difference, as clinically meaningful [19, 20]  [25] .  Assuming a standard 
deviation of 26 mm on the 100 -mm VAS scale [7] , enro lling  96 women  will provide us with 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
an 80% power, using a p -value of 0.05, to detect a [ADDRESS_644093].  This sample size is adjusted based on the ARE (asymptotic 
relative efficiency) of the Mann–Whitney U test statistic.  The ARE is based on distribution, 
which is unknown here.  Since the ARE for the Mann- Whitney is never less than 0.864, the 
sample size from the t- test above will be divided by [CONTACT_500099].  This creates a sample size of 
111 women.  To account for a potential 20% loss to follow up, the target enrollment goal 
will be increased to 133  total women for participation in this study.    
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: 
 
Inclusion criteria include: 
- Women >=18 years -old 
- Presenting for a surgical abortion 
- Fluency in English and able to provide informed consent 
- Has a driver to take them home 
Exclusion criteria include: 
- Allergy, sensitivity or contraindication to gabapentin  
- Severe renal disease  
- Currently using gabapentin or pregalabin 
- Contraindication to outpatient abortion under local anesthesia  
 
Although patients on any chronic pain medications or with pre- existing pain conditions or 
history of alcohol or drug use may have a different metabolism or effect of the drugs, these women will not be excluded. Rather, data will be collected on these factors to evaluate the impact of these factors on study outcomes.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_644094] recruitment and allocation  
 All recruitment, consenting, screening , and enrollment questions will be asked by [CONTACT_500100] a private room.  
 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
Recruitment:  
We will be recruiting until a total of [ADDRESS_644095] at Atlanta Women’s Center (AWC).  Women who  attend the AWC for an 
abortion will be approached during their preoperative evaluation.  The flow of steps to 
assess women presenting for abortion occur in the following order: ultrasound for 
gestational age, blood draw to assess hemoglobin and Rh factor,  options counseling to 
determine whether surgical abortion is chosen, financial payment, and nurse preoperative review.   Trained research staff will approach these women to determine interest in 
participating in the study, consent those interested in participating, and then participants will be screened for eligibility.  A standard recruitment script will be employed (Appendix A).  We will enroll participants  after financial counseling and before nurse preoperative 
review.   Consent will be obtained at time of enrollment.   
 
Screening and consent:   
Individuals who are interested in participating will review the informed consent and 
eligibility screening. We will screen for eligibility using an eligibility checklist (Appendix A).  
Patient contact [CONTACT_500101].  Enrollment  will occur after 
financial counseling, and consent will be obtained at time of enrollment.  Following enrollment, the patient’s  medical history will be reviewed by a clinician to ensure study 
eligibility.  Ra ndomization will occur and intervention will be received  after enrollment.  
The study drug (intervention or placebo) will be dispensed by [CONTACT_978] , Clinic D irector , or 
Clinic Staff Nurse.   Both the Clinic Director and Clinic Staff Nurse are registered nurses with 
required CITI training.  
 Potential subjects will typi[INVESTIGATOR_500085] 24hr consent over the phone prior to presenting to the clinic. Thus, the preoperative evaluation and procedure both occur on the same day. We are not approaching any potential subjects for interest in the study until after they h ave 
selected local anesthesia and paid for their procedure.  
 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
The abortion providers are not involved in the discussion with the patient regarding 
“timing, method, or procedures used to terminate a pregnancy”. This is a discussion that the clinic staff has with the patient after ultrasound evaluation (to confirm gestational age) and financial counseling. The patient also goes through options counseling with clinic staff 
(not the abortion provider) during which the different types of procedures are discussed 
(medical vs surgical procedure based on gestational age). The study team will only begin interaction with the potential subject/patient once they’ve selected local anesthesia and paid for their procedure. The Investigators will only be involved after this point. Investigator involvement may include consenting the subject, administering the study drug, performing the procedure, and other study related activities such as administering the questionnaire. There is one abortion provider per day at Atlanta Women’s Clinic and if an 
investigator is the provider for that day, she will not participate in any other study -related 
activities.  
 
The person obtaining the consent will be a member of the study team.  This person will have no prior contact [CONTACT_500102].  This person will not be scheduling the appointment, discussing options counseling, advising about the procedural options, or performing ultrasound or other laboratory work- up for the participant prior to the 
procedure.  There is a clear separation between study staff and clinic staff prior to the enrollment of participants into the study,  
 Randomization, Allocation Method and Blinding:  
Women who enroll and  meet study inclusion criteria will be eligible for participation.  
Randomization  will be done using computer -generated random numbers 
(randomization.com) in variable blocks of 4 and 6.   Allocation  concealment will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_500103][INVESTIGATOR_223300]. Gabapentin and placebo tablets will be indistinguishable by [CONTACT_43463] (both gelatin capsules) , thus maintaining blinding for participants and assessors. To maintain double 
blinding for  both investigators and participants, an individual not associated with study 
conduct will create the randomization sequence and allocation containers. The study drug 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
and placebo will be obtained through the Duke Investigational Drug Service that will 
vacuum seal the containers prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_500086]. The randomization assignments will only be rev ealed at the point of data analysis or if an interim assessment is needed . 
1.3.4 Description of the drugs and devices to be studied  
 
Gabapentin was originally approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Fo od and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
December 1993, for use as an adjuvant (effective when added to other antiseizure drugs) 
medication to control partial seizures  in adults; that indication was extended to children in 
2000 [21] , and later approved for treating postherpetic neuralgia.  In December 2004, the 
FDA granted final approval to a generic equivalent to Neurontin made by [CONTACT_500104] .  It was originally synthesized to mimic the chemical structure of the neurotransmitter 
GABA. The mode of action of gabapentin is believed to be through its binding to the alpha 2 
delta subunit of the DRN voltage- dependent calcium channels.  This causes decreased entry 
of calcium into the nerve endings, resulting in decreased release of nociceptive neurotransmitter (glutamate, substance p, noradrenaline).  Other proposed mechanisms of action include the binding to NMDA receptors, sodium channel receptors, monoaminergic receptors, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328].  
Overall, gabapentin is a safe drug. The most common side effects of its use include: 
dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, ataxia, peripheral edema, nystagmus, nausea and vomiting, asthenia, headache, weight gain, and amblyopia.  Most of the side effects are associated with chronic usage.  Other extremely rare side effects include: DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), multi- organ hypersensitivity, withdrawal seizures 
(if given for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), suicidal behavior and ideation, neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric patients (3 -12 years of age), and sudden death . 
Drug Interactions are rare and mild. Maalox or other aluminum or magnesium 
hydroxides decreases bioavailability of gabapentin by 20% if given at same time.  Additionally, when used with hydrocodone or morphine, gabapentin may decrease the AUC.  Abuse and withdrawal potential is lo w.  The drug is almost entirely metabolized 
through renal metabolism, where it is eliminated unchanged in the urine, thus dosage adjustments are needed for patients with renal impairment.  The half -life for the 
medication is [ADDRESS_644096] will be placed 
on their medical chart, and the participant will be accompanied by [CONTACT_500105].  This designated research room is a private 
room located in AWC.  The study team will then review the recruitment script with the 
patient.  If the patient is interested in the study, then a member of the study team will consent the participant.  Following consent and enrollment into the study, the participant will be taken to the clinical nurse.  The nurse will review the participan t’s chart to ensure 
eligibility for surgical abortion and gabapentin administration.  The participant will then receive the study drug or placebo.  Following administration of the drug, the participant 
will return to the designated research room.  The  study st aff will review the baseline 
questionnaire that includes demographic questions.  Following completion of the 
questionnaire, the participant will continue to wait in the designated research room or preoperative area.  One hour after the administration of the drug or placebo, the participant’s chart will be placed back into rotation for surgical procedures.  The study team will accompany the participant to the clinical lounge where they will gown and prepare for the procedure.  The participant will then undergo the procedure in order of 
chart placement.  Prior to initiating the abortion procedure, study staff will administer the 
preoperative questions.   Staff will administer the intraoperative questions at the time of 
evacuation during the uterine aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and at time of removal of the speculum at the end of the procedure.  Immediately following the procedure, the study staff will follow the participant to the recovery room to complete the remaining questions assessed at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and at discharge. Per clinic protocol, patients remain in the recovery room for approximately 30 -60 minutes after surgical abortion with local anesthesia. When 
the discharge questions are complete, the participant will receive a $ [ADDRESS_644097] a follow -up call the following day (post operative day #1).  
1.3.6 Follow -up procedure

On the day following the procedure (approximately 24 hours after the abortion), study staff

 Withdrawals, losses, and deviations:  
Randomization to the study method will occur after completion of all intake forms and consent, immediately before the pi[INVESTIGATOR_500087], thus reducing the possibility of withdrawal after randomization. Any significant medical history will be reviewed prior to enrollment with a clinician at the clinic to ensure study eligibility.  Primary outcome measures and most secondary outcome measures will be assessed immediately before, 
during or after the abor tion procedure, thus any loss to follow -up will be limited to those 
who consent to, but change their mind while waiting for their procedure. Based on current 
clinical practice at this clinic, withdrawal after consent is extremely rare. Our secondary outcom es assessed post- operatively after discharge will be collected via telephone. We will 
maximize completion of these assessments through the following steps: participants will be 
told beforehand about the telephone contact [CONTACT_500107], a cellular  telephone 
number will be collected and tested at the clinic, a secondary phone number and email will be 
collected as a backup, participants will be given a contact [CONTACT_500108] , and participants will receive an 
additional $[ADDRESS_644099] adjusted our study enrollment to provide some 
accommodation for 20% loss to follow-up. 
1.3.7 Criteria for discontinuation  
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any health -related reaction, effect, toxicity or abnormal 
laboratory result that a study participant experiences during the course of the study, 
irrespective of relationship to the study intervention.  This includes changes in a participant’s condition that have or could have a deleterious effect on a participant’s health 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
or well -being.  A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any experience that is fatal or 
life threatening, requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109577], or results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
 This study uses an additional medication for pain control in the setting of outpatient 
abortion.  These activities are not anticipated to be associated with any deleterious impact 
on participants’ health or well -being beyond the risks associated with the abortion 
procedure. AEs will be managed according to good clinical practice and the judgment of the on-site physician. All clinical and laboratory AEs will be followed -up closely by [CONTACT_464]. 
Any SAEs will be expeditiously reported to the principal investigators, via a designated SAE form.  Notif ication and submission of SAE forms should occur within [ADDRESS_644100] possibly related to study intervention will be 
submitted to Emory IRB . 
 The study may be discontinued at any time by  [CONTACT_500109] a participating institution or 
the Office for Human Research Protection.  One of the co -investigators (TH) will review any 
adverse event and periodically review side effects to see if there are an increased number 
of events than anticipated by [CONTACT_500110].  If any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_500088], study allocation may be revealed for a preliminary analysis and if related to the study intervention, the study could be prematurely ended.  
 
Data Monitoring Committee/Study Termination:   
A Da ta Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be created to perform regular and timely review 
of data in order to identify early, significant benefit or harm for patients while the trial is in progress.  On a regular basis (frequency as to be determined by [CONTACT_500111]), non- identified safety data will be 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
communicated to the DMC who will then meet to review the data.  The DMC will be 
composed of three faculty members within the Emory University Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Individuals who are investigators or co -investigators cannot be 
members.  No member of the research study team will be on the committee.  Members 
must have no financial, scientific, or other conflicts of interest with the study.  All 
investigators understand that the DMC serves as additional human subject’s protection, but does not supplant reporting of significant adverse events to the Emory IRB. The DMC may devise its own stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and if there are significant numbers of adverse events, the DMC will recommend continuation, modification, or termination of the study after each meeting.  This recommendation will be communicated to the p rincip al investigator who is 
responsible for reviewing the recommendation and forwarding it to th e IRB.  .

protected relational database (REDCap).  All data will be collected electronically into the 
database on tablets.  All consent documents will be filed in a locked  cabinet and stored for 
future reference.  Data will be collected on research -designated tablets.  
1.3.10 Data analysis  
 
We will compare groups on the primary continuous outcome measure (pain score on  
100-mm point VAS) using T -tests  and Mann- Whitney U test.  Chi -square and T -tests will be 
used to evaluate secondary outcomes for categorical and continuous variables, 
respectively. Baseline characteristics will be evaluated for potential interaction or confounding with primary and secondary outcomes.  
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
All available data from completed questions will be used for analysis, including 
partially completed surveys.  Participants may request that their data not be used for 
analysis if a request is received prior to analysis as mentioned in the consent form. A statistician will  be consulted to assist with the analysis as needed . 
1.3.[ADDRESS_644102] a 15-mm difference on the 100 -mm VAS . A 100- mm pain visual analog 
scale has been shown to be useful for the evaluation of pain in prior pain abortion research [7, 18] , with a 30% difference on a 100 mm -VAS scale, or 13 -mm to 22 -mm difference, as 
clinically meaningful [19, 20]  [25] .  Assuming a standard deviation of 26 mm on the 100 -
mm VA S scale [7]  based  on the literature, a total of 96 participants will provide us with an 
80% power, using a p -value of 0.05,  to detect a [ADDRESS_644103].  This sample size is adjusted based on the ARE (asymptotic relative efficiency) 
of the Mann–Whitney U test statistic.  The ARE is based on distribution, which is unknown here.  Since the ARE for the Mann- Whitney is never less than 0.864, the sample size from 
the t- test above will be divided by [CONTACT_500099].  This creates a sample size of 111 women.  To 
account for a potential 20% loss to follow up, the target enrollment goal will be increased to 133 total women for participation in this study.  Therefore we determined that 1 33 
women would need to be enrolled .  
1.3.12 Study limitations  
 
Strengths of this study include the location site and its ability to recruit the sample 
population, as well as the previous research being done at AWC.  Pain perception is complex and composed of a multitude of elements.  This study will also attempt to al low for 
the comprehensive evaluation of pain and identify behavioral factors that influence one’s 
perception of pain throughout the abortion. 
Fellowship in Family Planning Research Proposal Outline
   
   
Limitations of the study include gestational age limits.  Local anesthesia is only 
offered to patients up to 14 -15 weeks so this will not allow for the evaluation of later 
gestational ages in which patient’s may benefit from this adjunct medication.    
Gabapentin is low -cost and effective in perioperative settings, and may be an 
effective adjunctive therapy for surgical abortion.  Future direction may involve a 
prospective multi- site analysis (PMA).   PMA methodology will evaluate the potential effect 
of adding gabapentin to different pain control regimens and among different patient populations, maximizing external validity. Further, we aim to leverage the developed PMA infrastructure to apply for future large research studies in abortion care, providing an innovative and feasible approach for developi[INVESTIGATOR_500089] .

2. Ethical Considerations  
 
The study will not commence until the study protocol has been reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_500112] I nstitutional R eview B oard (IRB).  
 
Risk of medication: Gabapentin has been used in several other clinical settings and is 
associated with few side effects, thus the risks associated with its use as an adjunct to abortion perioperative pain regimens are minimal.  As this is a low -cost intervention that 
has promise for improving pain, the potential for risk is balanced by [CONTACT_227239].  Side effects and adverse effects will be carefully tracked and monitored during the study.  
Documented side effects of gabapentin include: dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, ataxia, 
peripheral edema, nystagmus, nausea and vomiting, asthenia, headache, weight gain, and amblyopia.  Most side effects are associated with chronic usage.  Other rare side effects include: DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), multi- organ 
hypersensitivity, withdrawal seizures (if given for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), suicidal behavior and ideation, neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric patients (3 -12 years of age ), and sudden death.  
 
Sensitive information: The risks involved in study participation are those related to 
providing personal information about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  Participants’ privacy and the confidentiality of data will be protected through training of study staff, conducting all interview s and procedures  in private, storing study materials in a locked room, and 
securing computer files that include identifiers.  Only the study identification number will identify participant research records.  Linkages between the ID number and participants’ identifying information will be maintained in a computer database that is password protected and only accessible to study staff. These linkages will be destroyed 7 years after completion of study activities.  We will ensure that study staff is thoroughly trained to not disclose any information about the study or the participant’s attendance at the clinic to any individual other than the study participant.  Breaches of confidentiality are possible, 
though safeguards are in place to protect the confidentiality of participants.  Thus, the 
potential for experiencing an adverse event is minimal .

Gabapentin:  
Gabapentin is indicated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia in adults, as 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizure disorder, and for chronic pain management.   
Gabapentin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the 
drug or its ingredients.  When gabapentin is taken for chronic use, side effects are noted.  
Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, also know at multiorgan 
hypersensitivity, has occurred with gabapentin.  These reactions can be fatal or life threatening.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_500090], rash, 
lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis.  In the presence of signs or symptoms, prompt evaluation and discontinuation of gabapentin is warranted.  Although rare, gabapentin can cause anaphylaxis and 
angioedema after the first dose or any time during treatment.  The patient should be 
instructed to discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical attention.  
 During the controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_500091] 12 years of age, the 
patients who received gabapentin (up to 1800mg daily) reported greater rates of somnolence (19%), dizziness (7%) and ataxia (6%) when compared to the placebo group.  During the controlled trials in patients with postherpetic  neuralgia taking doses of 
gabapentin up to 3600mg, patients reported increased somnolence (21% of the gabapentin 
arm vs. 5% of the placebo arm), and dizziness (28% of the gabapentin arm vs. 8% of the 
placebo arm).   Patients should be carefully observed for signs of central nervous system 
depression, especially when gabapentin is used with other drugs with sedative properties.   
 Antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs), including gabapentin, increase the risk of suicidal 
thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.  Patients should be monitored for the emergence or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or unusual changes in mood or behavior.  Pooled analysis showed that patient 
randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk of suicidal thinking or 
behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo.  It should be noted that these trials had a median treatment duration of [ADDRESS_644107] 1% of gabapentin 
treated patients with postherpatic neuralgia participating in placebo -controlled trials .

Data presented here is directly from FDA prescribing information.  The gabapentin drug 
information in this section is from the FDA website.   Our study will only administer a one-
time dose of gabapentin, and therefore we do not anticipate the side effects listed that are 
more likely associated with chronic use.

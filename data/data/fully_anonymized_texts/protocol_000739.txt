been shown to provide anti -plaque and anti -gingivitis benefits. Optimization of the delivery of the 
ingredients to the oral cavity is key to enhance the therapeuti c benefit s. The present study is 
designed to evaluate the plaque control benefit of  an 0.4% SnF2 preventive treatment gel.  
2. Study Objective  
The objective of the  study is to evaluate anti -plaque effi cacy of a preventive treatment gel  in a 
modified [ADDRESS_1106970].   Before the treatment period, s ubjects will be randomly 
assigned to a treatment sequence.  At the baseline visit of  each period, an Oral Soft Tissue Exam  
(OST) , a digital plaque imag e (DPIA) , and a plaque exam using Turesky Modified Quigley -Hein 
Plaque  Index  (TMQHPI) will be  conducted, followed by a polishing on both the lingual and buccal 
surfaces of the teeth . During the treatment phase, subjects will be asked to brush  with Crest 
Cavity Protection on their lingual surfaces for [ADDRESS_1106971] Exam , a digital plaque imag e (DPIA) , and a final plaque exam  
(TMQHPI) . At period [ADDRESS_1106972] usage ,the subjects will be aske d to 
provide 5 ml of saliva into a label ed vial. There will be a washout period of approximately 7 days 
between treatment periods to prevent treatment carryover.

product.  
Oral Examination  
Assessment of the oral soft tissue is conducted via a visual examination of the oral cavity and 
perioral area utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and ga uze.  The structures examined 
include the gingiva (free and attached), hard and soft palate, oropharynx/uvula, buccal mucosa, 
tongue, floor of the mouth, labial mucosa, mucobuccal/mucolabial folds, lips, and perioral area.  
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. [ADDRESS_1106985] dental light, dental mirror, and air syringe.  All abnormal 
findings will be recorded and categorized by [CONTACT_669176]; hard tissue findings will be cate gorized 
as “other .”  An AE will be recorded if a new abnormal finding is noted after product distribution or 
any previously noted abnormal finding increases in severity during the treatment period.  
13. Efficacy Variables  
Fluorescein Plaque Disclosing Procedure  and Digital Plaque Image Analysis (DPIA) Collection 
System and Analysis   
 
Fluorescein Plaque Disclosing Procedure  
• Rinse for 10 seconds with 25 ml of phosphate buffer;  
• Rinse for 1 minute with 5.0 ml of 1240 ppm fluorescein in phosphate buffer;  
• Rinse [ADDRESS_1106986] the lips and cheeks (toward the ears) as far as possible.   The incisal edges of the front 
teeth are placed about 5mm – 10mm from each other and centered in the camera.   Prior to 
exposure the subject is instructed to draw air through the teeth and to position the tongue away 
from the teeth so that the tongue is not visible.  The image is taken of the lips, teeth and gums 
only; the whole face is not visible in the image.  Each im age is saved in a file with the subject ID 
number.  
Plaque Examination  
The plaque deposits on the teeth will be scored on six surfaces ( distobuccal, midbuccal, 
mesiobuccal, distolingual, midlingual and mesiolingual)  of all 28 teeth (excluding 3rd molars, 
crowns and surfaces with cervical restorations) according to the Quigley -Hein Index as modified by 
[CONTACT_801962] .  Buccal, lingual, and whole 
mouth average plaque scores will be calculated for each subject and tooth surfaces by [CONTACT_801963] .  Scoring criteria are shown in 
Table 3.

Examiner:  A. Das  
             Red Plaque Disclosing Dye Procedure and Preparation  
Approximately twenty (20) drops of undiluted plaque disclosing solution is dispensed directly from 
the manufacturer’s original bottle into plastic dosage cups. Study Subjects are given the dosage 
cup to swish the disclosing solution orally for [ADDRESS_1106988] up to 5 minutes to provide this amount. Collected s amples will be 
kept on ice at the site and then frozen at -70C. The  saliva samples will be analyzed for tin and 
fluoride  outside of the study protocol .  
14. Hypothesis  
For TMQHPI [INVESTIGATOR_801958] ( whole mouth,  buccal and lingual  surfaces ) and percent plaque area  
the following hypotheses will be tested.  
Null:   The mean plaque score is equal between the treatments.  
Alternative:  The mean plaque score is not equal between the treatments.  
15. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The primary endpoint is the whole mouth average TMQH PI [INVESTIGATOR_801958]. Plaque scores and 
percent plaque area will be analyzed separately for each surface using a general linear mixed 
model.  The statistical model will include treatment and period as fixed e ffects as well as subject 
as a random effect.  Carryover effect will be assessed and  may be included in the model  if 
reasonably appropriate .  Baseline may be used as a covariate.  Statistical comparisons will be 
two-sided with a significance level of 0.05.   Additional analyses of the data may be performed.  
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. [ADDRESS_1106989] access to study records and source data/documentation, including subject medical 
records, will be provided as needed to appropriate parties for the purpose of trial -related 
monitoring, audit ing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection.  Prior to participating in the study, 
subjects will consent, in writing, to the release of their medical records for said purposes.  
Data Collection  
The Data Manager will supply the paper and/or electronic CRF s to be used in this study.  It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to maintain and submit accurate and timely CRFs to the Sponsor.  
All hard copy CRFs will be filled out legibly in ink.  
All questions should be answered.  For paper CRFs, if an entry  requires correction, a single line 
will be placed through the entry so as not to obscure the original record, the corrected entry will 
be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_121754], and a reason will be given for the 
change.  There will be no  whiteouts or erasures.  For electronic CRFs, if an entry requires 
correction, the change is made directly to the CRF in the database, the user is prompted to 
provide a reason for the change, and the correction is logged in by [CONTACT_121755].  
As necessary, the Data Manager may make specified allowable changes to the database without 
issuing a query to the site, as agreed upon by [CONTACT_395312]. Examples of allowable 
changes include incorrect date formats, incorrect current year reco rded (as in the start of a new 
year), and unambiguous spelling errors. Changes to common abbreviations and symbols to 
equivalent text to meet system or coding constraints (e.g., @ = at, ~ = approximately), may also 
be allowable. Values that are ambiguous o r open to interpretation will be queried to the sites.  It is 
the responsibility of the Data Manager to ensure all changes are supported by [CONTACT_395313]/or are unambiguous.  
Source Documents  
The Investigator has the responsibility for  ensuring that all source documents (i.e., study and/or 
medical records) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol and 
are available at the site.  Any CRF used as a source document must be identified as such in the 
Investigator Notebook.

Non-invasive Positive Expi[INVESTIGATOR_13955] ( nPEP)  Device for TBM -associated Cough 
 
Abstract  
We aim to determine if an expi[INVESTIGATOR_880787]- invasive positive 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (nPEP) will abort coughing paroxysms , reduce airway resistance and 
improve quality of life in patients with tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) who are not candidates 
for tracheal stenting.  
 
Research Summary  
Patients at Duke University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880788], debilitating TBM -related cough and possible 
tracheal stenting, but who are not candidates for tracheal stenting due to their airway 
anatomy, will be given the nPEP device . 
 
The nPEP device is assembled using mostly existing component s with a history of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_880789] . Specifically, a standard, adjustable (5 -20 cm H 2O) positive end 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) valve manufactured for attachment to a manual resuscitator 
(commonly known as bag -valve -mask) device is connected to a flexible respi[INVESTIGATOR_342222] . 
Patients will be instructed by [CONTACT_880800] . The patients 
will trial the nPEP device  immediately during their clinical encounter  and w ill be given a 
mask to take home  for 2 weeks .  
 
Objectives- primary  
The primary objective is to determine if use of the nPEP device  can decrease cough severity 
and improve cough related quality of life  (QOL) .  
 
Objectives- secondary  
The secondary objective is to determine if use of the nPEP device  improves airway 
physiology by [CONTACT_880801].  
 Objectives & hypothesis 
Background and significance-  Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a condition in which the 
cartilage and/or other connective tissue in the trachea and bronchi are weak, resulting in 
collapse of those large airways during exhalation, especially forceful exhalation as occurs with 
coughing  [1]. The airway collapse with coughing leads to further, ongoing coughing, possibly 
because mechanical stimulation of the mucosa during collapse may cause localized mucosal 
inflammation or stimulation of neural circuits that control cough.  
 
TBM can cause a range of symptoms, inc luding debilitating paroxysms of coughing, dyspnea, 
wheezing, and recurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. In severe cases of TBM -related cough, patients 
experience morbidity including  QOL impairment, social isolation, fatigue, loss of ability to work, 
recurrent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880790].  
 
The only curative treatment for TBM is a surgical procedure called tracheobronchoplasty, in 
which the chest is opened and the posterior membrane of the trachea and/or bronchi are 
surgically affixed to nearby [CONTACT_341050], with or without implantation of surgical mesh [2]. This is 
an approximately [ADDRESS_1231053] undergone and proven to benefit from temporary 
impla ntation of a tracheal/bronchial stent in the region of collapse. Many patients are not 
candidates for tracheobronchoplasty itself due to medical comorbidities, prefer to avoid the 
associated risks, or are not candidates for the required tracheal stenting due to trachea size or 
anatomy. These patients are left without a viable therapeutic option for their severe cough.  
 
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices have been reported to stop or prevent 
cough in TBM, presumably through  the pneumatic stenting  of large airways to maintain their 
patency during exhalation [3]. CPAP devices, however, are not labeled for this indication and 
their functional utility is very limited given size of the device, need for a power source, and multiple steps to don the equipment that are not easily completed while actively and 
uncontrollably coughing. We hypothesize that use of the nPEP device  will result in decreased 
cough severity and improve cough quality of life by [CONTACT_880802] . 
 
Design 
Ten subjects with chronic cough and TBM diagnosed by [CONTACT_880803] (CT) scan will be recruited. Comorbid conditions that can cause chronic cough, 
such as asthma, COPD, and GERD, must be treated if present, for subjects to qualify. At the 
pre-baseline visit (V -1), after obtaining written informed consent, each subject will complete 
validated cough questionnaires to quantify their cough severity and cough -related QOL  at 
baseline. The baseline visit (V1) will occur approximately two weeks later, after a run -in peri od 
to minimize observation bias related to the cough questionnaires. At V1, the cough 
questionnaires will be repeated and subjects’ airway resistance and reactance will be measured 
with impulse oscillometry (IOS) . Subjects  will then be given the nPEP devic e by [CONTACT_880804]. Approximately two weeks after device delivery, at the follow -up visit 
(V2), cough questionnaires and IOS will be repeated and they will be asked for feedback 
regarding device design and user experience. Subjec ts may then be entered into a cohort for up 
to six additional months, during which there will be no study visits or procedures, but subjects may be contact[CONTACT_880805].

Device Description  
The nPEP device is intended as a single- patient , adjustable expi[INVESTIGATOR_880795] (5 to 20 cm H
2O) during expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  The device is assembled using 
mostly existing components with a history of respi[INVESTIGATOR_880789]. Specifically, a standard, adjustable (5 -20 cm H
2O) positiv e end expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) valve manufactured for 
attachment to a manual resuscitator (commonly known as bag- valve -mask) device is connected 
by a connector pi[INVESTIGATOR_356742] a flexible respi[INVESTIGATOR_342222]. The connector pi[INVESTIGATOR_113967] a one- way 
valve to allow for inspi[INVESTIGATOR_880796]. The user may adjust the resistance of the device 
by [CONTACT_880810], until the desired effect (cessation of coughing epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) 
is obtained.

 Potential Benefits  
Subjects may experience direct benefit from the device, including reduction in cough symptom 
severity and increase in cough -related QOL. There is also a potential scientific and societal  
benefit in that this pi[INVESTIGATOR_880797] a non -invasive  alternative to tracheobronchoplasty  
for patients with TBM -related cough.  
 
Potential Risks  
Potential risks related to participation in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_880798],  risk of skin 
irritation from device components, and risk of pneumothorax  from positive pressure during 
cough . Privacy risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_880811] a locked 
cabinet or office, entering data into an electroni c database protected by [CONTACT_880812], and using only de- identified data in data exports. Risk of skin irritation from the device is 
minimal, given that the mask used is an approved, off -the-shelf component used in other 
medical applications , and contact [CONTACT_880813] a mild condition typi[INVESTIGATOR_880799]; a literature review has indicated that contact [CONTACT_880814]. There is a potential theoretical  risk of pneumo thorax . The 
expectation is that this would be a rare occurance  as the pathophysiology of TBM is such that 
central airway resistance likely prevents the pressure set at the device from being transmitted to 
the distal small airways or lung parenchyma. The maximum resistance applied by [CONTACT_8121] (20 
cm H
2O) remains very small in comparison to the intrathoracic pressure generated through 
coughing itself, which has been shown to be in the range of 136- 340 cm H 2O [4]. Regardless , 
patients with personal history  of prior pneumothorax or primary parenchymal lung disease will 
be excluded.  
 
Costs to subject  
There will be no additional costs to subjects of the study . Routine care will be charged to the 
participant or their insurance.  
 

Subject reimbursement  
Subjects will be reimbursed a total of $50 for study completion. This will be issued upon 
completion of Visit 2.   
 Data analysis 
Statistical analyses include: a) descriptive and summary statistics of demographic and clinical 
variables, b) pre and post nPEP device treatment comparison of the primary and secondary 
outcomes (cough quality of life) using paired t -test for normally distributed and transformed data 
or Wilcoxon’s Signed Rank test for non -parametric paired data, and c) pre and post nPEP 
device assessment of airway physiology  as assessed by [CONTACT_880815] . 
  Data will be collected on paper forms and stored in each patient’s research binder on a secure 
location. Data will be entered into Redcap for subsequent analysis.   
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
In accordance with federal regulations the PI [INVESTIGATOR_147427], review, and promptly report to the 
IRB, appropriate institutional officials, sponsor, coordinating center and the appropriate 
regulatory agency head all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others that 
occur in the course of a subject’s participation in a research, all AE reports will be reported per 
the DUHS IRB policies.

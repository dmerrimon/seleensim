Title of Study
An open-label, randomized, Phase 2, parallel, dos e-ranging, multicenter study of sotatercept for 
the treatment of patients with anemia and low- or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes
or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
Indication
Low- and intermediate-1 (int-1) risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or non-proliferative 
CMML by [CONTACT_380731] (IPSS, Appendix B ) with anemia 
(hemoglobin [Hgb] ≤9.0 g/dL)
Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to deter mine a safe, tolerable, and effective dose of 
sotatercept that results in the greatest frequenc y of erythroid hematological improvement (HI-E) 
in patients with anemia and low- or int-1 risk MDS or non-proliferative CMML.
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the:
1. Safety of sotatercept
2. Rate of red blood cell ( RBC) transfusion independence in transfusion-dependent subjects
3. Time to HI-E4. Duration of HI-E
5. Time to progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
6. Time to progression to events of higher risk MDS (ie, int-2 or high-risk IPSS)7. Progression-free survival (PFS)
8. Overall survival (OS)
9. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of sotatercept
Study Design
This is an open-label, randomized, Phase 2, parallel, dose-ranging, multicenter study of 
sotatercept for the treatment of patients with low- and int-1 risk MDS or non-proliferative 
CMML, (IPSS, Appendix B ), with anemia requiring a transfusion (subjects should have received 
at least 2 units of RBCs within 84 days prior to study enrollment).
The study is comprised of 2 parts:
Part 1
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_380732] (EPO, < 500 versus
≥500 mIU/mL) and by [CONTACT_380733] 56 days prior to study enrollment (< 4 
units of RBCs versus ≥4 units of RBCs), and assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups,&(/*(1(label, randlabel, rand

every 3 weeks (Q3W).
Enrollment will continue without hiatus beyond rando mization of five sub jects into each of the 
0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups.  Following treatment of five subjects in each of the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups (w ith the last subject for each group having 
completed at least one cycle of 21 days), all available safety and efficacy data will be assessed by 
a Steering Committee (Section 4.4).  Based upon the occurrence of dose- limiting tox icity (DLT) 
(Section 4.1.1 ) in≤1/5 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups, the 
0.5 mg/kg treatment group w ill begin inclusion in the ra ndomization scheme.
Following treatment of at least six subjects in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group (with at least six 
subjects having completed at least three cycles of  21 days each), all available safety and efficacy 
data will be assessed by a Steering Committee from all dose levels.  Based upon the occurrence 
of DLT in ≤ 1/6 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group and an acceptable safety 
profile from all dose levels, the 1.0 mg/kg treat ment group will begin inclusion in the 
randomizatio n scheme.  
Following treatment of at least six subjects in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group (with at least six
subjects having completed at least three cycle s of 21 days each), all available safety and efficacy 
data will be assessed by a Steering Committee from all dose levels.  Based upon the occurrence 
of DLT in ≤ 1/6 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group and an acceptable safety 
profile from all dose levels, the 2.0 mg/kg treat ment group will begin inclusion in the 
randomizatio n scheme.  The 2.0 mg/kg so tatercept dose was reduced to 1.5 mg/kg for ongoing 
and newly enrolled subjects (Amendment 4).
Intermediate cohorts (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg) may be added at the time of dose escalation up to 
1.0 mg/kg and up to 2.0 mg/kg (eg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg respectively) based on assessment 
by [CONTACT_380734].  Enrollment will continue beyond 
randomization in all dose levels (unless dose level[s] is closed due to safety reasons or lack of 
efficacy as recommended by [CONTACT_40972]) until up to a total of 20 subjects in each dose level.  
Meetings of the Steering Co mmit tee are planned periodically throughout the study to review all 
available safety and efficacy data.  For any treatment group, if ≥40% of the subjects (minimum 
four subjects experiencing an event) experience a DLT of related (suspected) adverse event (AE)
≥Grade 2 (other than Hgb or hyperten sion DLT as defined in Section 4.1.1 ), the Steering 
Committee may recommend the closure of the treatment group.
In addition, if > 33% of the s ubjects (minimum two subjects experiencing an event) experience 
Hgb > 12 g/dL (not influenced by [CONTACT_27752]) sustained for ≥7 days, confirmed by [CONTACT_380735] ≥1 week apart, the Steering Committee may recommend the closure of the 
treatment group.

recommended by [CONTACT_40972] (with the last subject having received at least one 
complete cycle of 21 days), in the absence of any sign of efficacy (defined as an increase of Hgb 
> 1 g/dL in the absence of transfusion or at least a 50% reduction in the transfusion requirementsif the reduction observed is less than 4 units), the Steering Committee may recommend the 
closure of the treatment group.
Upon completion of up to [ADDRESS_476894] frequency of HI-E.
Part 2Following the assessment of efficacy and safety  parameters in Part 1, 15 additional evaluable 
subjects will be enrolled in Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) and complete treatment at the dose level of 
sotatercept that demonstrates the greatest frequency of HI-E.
Steering Committee Recommendation
Based on the 02 Mar 2015 Steering Committee’s review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic 
data of subjects enrolled in the Part 1 dose levels, including the sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort level:
Part 1 - The sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort was close d.  Ongoing and newly enrolled subjects are 
to be dose reduced to sotatercept 1.5 mg/kg.
Part 2 - Subjects enrolled into Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) will receive sotatercept at 1.0 mg/kg. 
This update is reflected in Amendment 4.
Total Number of Subjects: Up to approximately 75-115 evaluable subjects
Study Population

Extension – After completing 5 cycles of treatment (or up to 8 cycles for potential late 
responders), subjects who qualify for the Extension Period (refer to Section 4.1.2 ) may enter the 
Extension Period and continue treatment ,subject to Rules for Delay, Reduction, and 
Discontinuation of Treatment (Section 8.2.1 ), until disease progression (PD), treatment failure, 
or other reason, as appropriate, listed in Section 12, Discontinuations.  Visits will be once Q3W
to coincide with the schedule of treatment administration.
End of Extension – Assessments to be conducted upon completion of participation in the 
Extension Period of the study.
Follow-up – Following the End of Treatment (last dose of sotatercept administered) in the
Treatment Period or the Extension Peri od, follow-up w ill include a pregnancy test approximately
[ADDRESS_476898] treatment; assessment of efficacy (ie, Hgb levels, transfusions) 
approximately [ADDRESS_476899]; assessment 
of PK at a single time point [ADDRESS_476900] treatment; assessm ent of antidrug antibody 
(ADA) repeated every [ADDRESS_476901] treatment; and assessment of progression to AML and OS every [ADDRESS_476902]’s first 
administration of sotatercept.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the
study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for
primary, secondary  analysis, as pre-specified in the protocol and/or the
Statistical Analysis Plan, whichever is the later date.
The sponsor may decide to end the trial when all key endpoints and objectives of the study have 
been analyzed, and the availability of a roll-over protocol exists into which any subjects that

Protocol ACE-011-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 17 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: 04 Aug [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a spectrum of hematologic malignancies characterized 
pathologically by [CONTACT_18451] m orphologic dysplasia and clinically by [CONTACT_380741] . There is considerable variation in both the 
clinical manifestation and severity of individual disorders within this group, ranging from the 
relatively mild and painless condition of refractory anemia (RA) to the much more severe 
refractory anemia with an excess of blasts (RAEB) that often progresses to acute leukemia 
(Heaney, 1999).  The current treatment algorithm is based dominantly on risk stratification using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS, Appendix B , Greenberg, 1997 ). In patients 
with low- or intermediate-1 (int-1) risk groups by  [CONTACT_380742] ( Komrokji, 2011 ).
More than 90% of patients diagnosed with MDS will have anemia during their course of disease; 
and 30%-50% of patients will be transfusion-dependent. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion 
dependence is an independent adverse prognostic factor in MDS ( Komrokji, 2011 ).  Anemia in 
MDS results from ineffective erythropoiesis. Accelerated apoptosis is the hallmark of early 
disease, while up-regulation of survival signals and clonal evolution are features of higher risk 
disease. Impaired clonogenic growth of pr imitive erythroid progenitors and impaired 
erythropoietin r eceptor signaling are major causes of anemia. Inflammatory cytokines and 
immune suppression within the microenvironment amplify accelerated apoptosis and the inherent 
defective erythroid maturation. Options for treating anemia in low- or int-1 risk MDS are limited. Erythroid-stimulating agents (ESAs) offer response rates of 20%-40%. Lenalidomide,
in non-deletion (5q) (non-del [5q]), lower risk MDS transfusion independence (TI), response 
rates are 26% with TI response duration less than a year ( Raza, 2008 ). Azacitidine and 
decitabine yield hematological improvements in approximately 40% of patients; however, most 
patients’ responses are typi[INVESTIGATOR_380715]. Although bone marrow transplantation 
(BMT) can cure low and int-[ADDRESS_476912] majority of patients with low-
or int-1 risk MDS will remain RBC transfusion- dependent and succumb from complications of 
the disease or iron overload rath er than progression of the disease.  There is an unmet need to 
develop novel agents for treating anemia in lower risk non-del (5q) MDS ( Komrokji, 2011 ).
1.1. Sotatercept for Treatment of Anemia in Lower (Low- or
Intermediate-1) Risk MDS
Treatment with sotatercept resulted in increased hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (Hgb), and 
absolute RBC number in both nonclinical and clinical studies.  The rapid and sustained increases 
in Hgb and HCT were observed in two Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, a Phase 2a study in subjects with multiple myeloma (MM), and a Phas e [ADDRESS_476913] cancer. The 
ability for sotate rcept to increase rapi[INVESTIGATOR_380716].

prednisolone, and thalidomide (MPT) anti-m yeloma therapy (Study A011-04), and a Phase [ADDRESS_476914] effects of sotatercept were dose-
dependent and time-dependent.  These Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data are consistent with the 
increased hematologic parameters observed in nonclinical studies. Results from the four completed clinical studies A011-01, A011-02, A011 -04, and A011-08 are summarized in the
Section 1.3,Summary of Clinical Experience.
Although the mechanism(s) underlying the stimulat ory effect of sotatercep t on eryth ropoiesis is
not fully understood, the result of clinical experience in healthy subjects showed a rapid and 
sustainable increase in mature erythrocytes released into circulation, suggesting that this impacts 
late stages of eryt hropoeisis.   
 
  
 
 
Activin Receptor Signaling
The activins (A-E) are a group of proteins that form dimers and heterodimers.  All are part of the 
superfamily of transforming growth factor- β (TGF-β) proteins.  The activin first described, 
activin A was initially identified as a gonadal differentiation factor involved in modulating 
secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] ( Ying, 1988 ).  Subsequently, 
the pleiotropic nature of activin A has become more apparent ( Woodruff, 1998) .  There is a 
growing body of data suggesting a role for activins in bone remodeling, specifically as a negative 
regulator of bone growth ( Perrien, 2007 ).  Before the two molecules were shown to  be id entical 
(Rivier, 1985 ), activin A was also descri bed as erythroid differentiation factor (EDF), effecting 
the maturation and differentiation of RBCs ( Murata, 1988) .  The mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_380743] 
A influences erythropoiesis r emains under investigation and, in fact, there are data from in vitro 
and in vivo studies that support erythropoiesis-stimu latory ( Shiozaki, 1992; Shiozaki, 1989 ) and 
erythropoiesis-inhibitory effects ( Nakao, 1991 ).
The high-affinity activin type II receptor (ActRIIA) binds a number of ligands in the TGF- β
superfamily including activins A and B, myos tatin, and other growth differentiation factors 
(GDFs), as well as a num ber of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members.  The 
ligand-bound ActRIIA then recruits the low-affinity Type I receptor (ActRIA or ALK-4) and 
then the receptor heterocomplex, through its cytoplasmic protein kinase activity, activates the SMAD sign aling cascade to eventually influence nuclear transcriptional f actors ( Chen, 2002; 
Mathews, 1994 ).  The competitive binding of activin recep tor ligands in the blood and tissues by

Sotatercept (ActRIIA-IgG1Fc) is a fusion pr otein consisting of the extracellular domain (ECD) 
of activin receptor IIA (ActRIIA) fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain, which includes the heavy 
chain hinge and constant domains CH2 and CH3.  The ECD sequence of ActRIIA is  completely 
conserved among numerous species including mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and humans;thus mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkeys have been considered relevant species for nonclinical 
evaluation of sotatercept.

1.3. Summary of Clinical Experience
1.3.1. A011-01:  A Phase 1a Study in Healthy Postmenopausal Women (Single-Dose)
Sotatercept was first studied in a Phase 1a,  single center, randomize d, double-bli nd, placebo-
controlled, single-dose, dose-escalation study in healthy, postmenopausal women ( Ruckle, 
2009 ).  Sotatercept was diluted in normal saline was administered as an IV infusion (over 
approximately 1 hour) or as a SC injection on Da y 1.  Dose levels were 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 
and 3.0 mg/kg IV and 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg SC.  A total of 48 subjects were enrolled; five active 
and one placebo subject at each of the IV and SC dose levels.  All subjects were followed for 4months following a single-dose administration.  
The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sotatercept was linear.  The overall mean exposure (AUC) 
was proportional to doses (0.01 to 3.0 mg/kg IV, and 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg SC).  Across IV doses ranging from 0.1 through 3.0 mg/kg, the mean CL ranged from 0.092 to 0.128 mL/h/kg, the 
volume of distribution ranged from 73.7 to 110 mL/kg, and the mean terminal half-life in serum 
(t
1/2, z) ranged from 23.7 to 31.8 days, with no apparent dependence on dose.  After SC 
administration of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, sotatercept was completely absorbed, and the mean t 1/2,z 
was approximately [ADDRESS_476915] commonly occurring (ie, those occ urring in more than [ADDRESS_476916] in an y treatment 
group) treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were  headache, infusion site reaction, injection 
site hemorrhage, and toothache.  The majority of the injection site reactions and injection site 
hemorrhages were in the first IV cohort and were related to infiltration of the IV site.  The majorities of treatment-emergent AEs were mild in severity and were j udged to be unrelated to 
sotatercept.  No death, serious AE (SAE), or AE leading to discontinuation was reported.  
Changes in RBCs, Hgb, reticulocytes, liver function tests, glucose, uric acid, amylase, and lipase occurred in some subjects.  Mild, transient elevations in pancreatic enzymes, liver enzymes, or 
glucose were reported as AEs in five subjects.  
There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs, physical examination, 
endocrine function, or electrocardiogram (ECG).  Preservation of adrenal cortical function was 
monitored through evaluation of serum electrolytes  (sodium and potassium) and through cortisol 
response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation.  omen (Singmen (Sing

Confidential and Propri etary 23 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: 04 Aug 2015No clinically significant finding was observed at doses up to 3.0 mg/kg IV, and sotatercept was 
well tolerated in healthy, postmenopausal women in single doses up to 0.1 mg/kg SC and 3.0 
mg/kg IV, the highest dose tested in this study.  
1.3.2. A011-02:  A Phase 1b Study in Healthy Postmenopausal Women (Multiple 
Doses)
Study A011-02 was a Phase 1b, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multi-dose, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of 
sotatercept in healthy postmenopausal women.  Four cohorts of 10 subjects each were planned at 
the following doses: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg administered SC.  Within each cohort, subjects were to be randomized to either active or placebo treatment in an 8:[ADDRESS_476917] in the 
1.0 mg/kg cohort experienced an SAE of progre ssive and persistent hypertension that was 
attributed to a rapid and significant increase in both Hgb (up to 20 g/dL) and HCT (up to 57.3%).

details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure . In addition, two subjects who were treated 
with sotatercept 1.0 mg/kg showed increases in Hgb but were asymptomatic at the time of the consultation and underwent prophylactic phlebotomies.
Based on the magnitude of the hematopoietic response, the Sponsor suspended dose escalation to 
the 2.0 mg/kg dose and further dosing in all cohorts as a result of this dose- limiting SAE of 
hypertension, attributed to a pharmacodynamic eff ect at the 1.0 mg/kg dose level.  A total of 31 
subjects were enrolled and treated.  Doses of sotatercept administered included 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0

aThe number of placebo subjects with data decreases over time as a result of the early termination of the study (ie, 
there were placebo subjects in each dosing cohort).  There were seven placebo subjects with data at baseline, Days 8, 15, and 36; six subjects with data at Days 29, 43, 57, and 85; five subjects with data on Days 71 and 113; four subjects with data on Day 64; three subjects with data on Day 141; two subjects with data on Day 99; and one 
subject with data on Days 92 and 169.
bNumber of doses administered per treatment group:  0.1 mg/kg, four doses; 0.3 mg/kg, three doses; 1.0 mg/kg, two doses.  Data beyond this study day were considered follow-up results.

AEs were those related to increases in hematologic laboratory measures in the 1.0 mg/kg dose 
group: HCT, Hgb, and RBC count.  The AEs of increased Hgb and/or HCT were reported for seven of the eight subjects in this dose group.  These events were reported as mild or moderate 
elevations; all were considered probably related to  study drug treatment.  Three of the subjects in 
the 1.0 mg/kg group with elevated Hgb underwent phlebotomies and all Hgb elevations resolved by [CONTACT_1008]-up period.  No eryth roid lineage AEs were reported in the 0.1 or 0.3 &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,[ZIP_CODE]$71.7575$7$7$7

limits by [CONTACT_2054].  
Paresthesia and dizziness were reported more frequently in the sotatercept groups, though the 
events were < Grade 2 and generally not considered drug related.  Other frequently reported events (eg, fatigue, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]) di d not appear to increase with dose and were 
generally mild.  
Adrenal cortical function was monitored through evaluation of serum electrolytes (sodium and 
potassium) and through cortisol response to ACTH stimulation.  All ACTH stimulation test 
results were normal.  
The PK profile of sotatercept was linear after SC administration.  Both AUC
0-28dand maximum 
concentration (C max) were dose proportional from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg following the first SC 
administration.  The t 1/2, z of sotatercept following the last dose in all three dose groups was 
identical, with mean t 1/2, z being approximately 23 days.  Based on one-compartmental modeling, 
the mean apparent total clearance (CL/F) ranged from 3.05 to 3.90 mL/d/kg and the mean 
apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) range d from 97.47 to 103.03 mL/kg, with no apparent 
dependence on dose.  
Bone mineral density was assessed by [CONTACT_751]- energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  A 
dose-dependent increase in the BMD of the total hip from baseline to end of study was observed, 
with a significant and rapid increase of 2.4% in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group, compared to a 0.7% decrease in the placebo group.  Bone mineral density  results for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_380719] 0.4% to 1.0% from baseline to study end in all active treatment groups, compared 
with a 0.5% decrease in the placebo group.
1.3.3. A011-04:  A Phase 2a Study in Patients with Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple 
Myeloma 
Study A011-04 was a Phase 2a, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multiple-dose, parallel group, dose-escalation study  to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of sotatercept in subjects with osteolytic lesions of MM.  
In this study, subjects were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to one of three doses of sotatercept (0.1, 
0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg) or placebo, administered every 28 days by [CONTACT_10530], for up to four doses 
over a 3-month period. Sotatercept was evaluated in combination with the anti-myeloma therapy 
of melphalan (4 mg/m
2on Days 1 to 7), prednisolone (40 mg/m2on Days 1 to 7), and 
thalidomide (100 mg per day) (MPT). The sites, Sponsor and Sponsor representatives were 
blinded to treatment assignment.  
Thirty subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study treatment: si x subjects 
received placebo, 24 subjects received sotatercept (eight subjects per dosing cohort [0.1, 0.3, and 
0.5 mg/kg sotatercept]).  Twenty-six (86.7%) s ubjects completed the study.  Two subjects 
discontinued study treatm ent due to AEs, including one subject in each of the 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg 
dose groups.  Two subjects discontinued study tr eatment due to non-AE reasons including one 
subject in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group who withdrew consent and was discontinued, and one subject in the 0.3 mg/kg dose group who was discontinued at the request of the investigator.  
In this study, 50.0% of subjects were female and the mean (range) age was 60.9 (41 to 79) years.  &(dii&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21mmaximum aximum

sotatercept dose groups; whereas, there was a maximum mean percent decrease in the placebo 
group.  Further, substantial improvements in BMD were observed in some subjects, and these 
improvements were more likely to occur in subjects who received the full course of sotatercept treatment.  Review of individual data showed that 8/24 (33.3%) subjects who received 
sotatercept had a ≥ 5% increase from baseline in spi[INVESTIGATOR_380720].  Further, a ≥ 5% increase in BMD was observed in 4/6 subjects who

1.3.4. A011-08: A Phase [ADDRESS_476926] cancer. Subjects were randomized to one of three sotatercept (0.1, 0.3, and 
0.5 mg/kg) treatment groups or to a placebo treatment group. Planned enrollment included 30 subjects in each of the three sotatercept treatment groups and 15 subjects in the placebo 
treatment group (2:2:2:1 ratio). Study treatment  was administered vi a SC injection every 
28 days for up to 4 treatments (Days 1, 29, 57, and 85). Subjects were administered concurrent 
treatment with a myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer per 
standard of care at the study site.
Due to changes in guidance for the treatment of CIA and a slower than expected rate of 
enrollment, the study was termin ated after [ADDRESS_476927] one dose of treatment: five subjects in the placebo treatment group, eight 
subjects in the sotatercept 0.1 mg/kg treatment group, 10 subjects in the sotatercept 0.3 mg/kg treatment group, and seven subjects in the sotatercept 0.5 mg/kg treatment group. The majority 
of subjects (29/30 [96.7%]) were white; all of the subjects were female; with a median age of 51 
years; and age ranged from 32 to 74 years. Demographic characteristics were similar across treatment groups.
Fourteen of 30 (46.7%) subjects completed study treatment. Fourteen  subjects in the three 
sotatercept treatment groups combined and two subjects in the placebo treatment group prematurely discontinued study treatment. Of th e 16 subjects who withdrew during the treatment 
period, eight subjects (50.0%) disc ontinued due to PD, four subjects (25.0%) withdrew consent, 
three subjects (18.8%) discontinued due to an AE, and one subject (6.3%) discontinued due to administration of an ESA.
Of the 25 subjects in the three sotatercept treatment groups combined, four (16.0%) were 
administered the planned four doses of study treatment. In the 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 0.5 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively, 1/8 (12.5%), 3/10 (30.0%), and 0/7 (0.0%) subjects 
were administered all four doses of sotatercept. Fourteen of 25 (56.0%) subjects in the three

1.5. Rationale for Study
In normal hematopoiesis, TGF- β inhibits proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells ( Sitnicka, 
1996 ), and negatively regulates erythropoiesis ( Zermati, 2000a; Zermati, 2000b ).  Because TGF-
β signaling generally has a negative effect on cell growth, inactivation of this pathway may 
prevent suppression of primary hematopoietic stem  cells and facilitate terminal erythroid 
maturation.  Increased plasma concentrations of TGF- β, and upregulation and overactivation of 
SMAD2, have been reported in bone marrow progenitors in patients with MDS and provide 
evidence of activation of sustained TGF- β signaling in MDS ( Zhou, 2011 ).  Thus, activation of 
SMAD2 by [CONTACT_4722]- β signaling may be an important event in ineffective hematopoiesis, and 
inhibition of SMAD2 could stimulate hematopo iesis from primary MDS progenitors.  Evidence 
to support this concept is provided in the observation that in vivo administration of LY-2157299, 
an antagonist of TGF- β receptor I kinase, improved anemia in a transgenic mouse model 
overexpressing TGF- β and stimulated hematopoiesis in bone marrow from patients with MDS 
(Zhou, 2011 ).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Sotatercept has the potential to provide benefit in  a variety of conditions in which ineffective 
erythropoiesis c ontributes significantly to anemia and overall disease morbidity, including MDS.

Additionally, preliminary review of available safety data from ACE- 011-MDS-001 in the 
0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg dose levels shows a benign safety profile 
consistent with the known safety profile of sotatercept, with no new safety signals identified.  Furthermore, analysis of clinical and PK/PD data from completed studies at single dose levels up 
to 3.0 mg/kg IV (A011-01) and multi-dose levels  up to 1.0 mg/kg SC (A011-02) in regards to

4.1. Design of Study
This is an open-label, randomized, Phase 2, parallel, dose-ranging, mu lticenter study of 
sotatercept for the treatment of patients with lo w- and int-1 risk MDS or non-proliferative 
CMML, by [CONTACT_56623] ( Appendix B ), with anemia (Hgb ≤9.0 g/dL).
The study is comprised of 2 parts:Part 1
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_380746] (< 500 versus ≥500 mIU/mL), by 
[CONTACT_380747] 56 days pri or to study enrollment (< 4 units of RBCs versus ≥4 
units of RBCs), and assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups wherein they will be 
administered sotatercept, SC, 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg Q3W.
Enrollment will continue without h iatus beyond rando mization of five sub jects into each of the 
0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups.  Followi ng treatment of five subjects in each of the 
0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups (w ith the last subject for each group having 
completed at least one cycle of 21 days), all availab le safety and efficacy data will be assessed by 
a Steering Committee (Section 4.4).  Based upon the occurrence of dose- limiting tox icity (DLT)
(Section 4.1.1 ) in ≤1/5 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups, the 
0.5 mg/kg treatment group will begin inclusion in the randomization scheme.  
Following treatment of at least six subjects in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group (with at least six 
subjects having completed at least three cycles of 21 days each), all available safety and efficacy 
data will again be assessed by a Steering Committee from all dose levels.  Based upon the occurrence of DLT in ≤ 1/6 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group and an 
acceptable safety profile from all dose levels, the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group will begin inclusion 
in the ra ndomizatio n scheme.  
Following treatment of at least six subjects in  the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group (with at least six
subjects having completed at least three cycles of 21 days each), all available safety and efficacy 
data will again be assessed by a Steering Committee from all dose levels.  Based upon the occurrence of DLT in ≤ 1/6 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group and an 
acceptable safety profile from all dose levels, the 2.0 mg/kg treatment group will begin inclusion 
in the rando mization scheme.  The 2.0 mg/kg sotatercept dose was reduced to 1.5 mg/kg for 
ongoing and newly enrolled subjects (Amendment 4).
Intermediate cohorts (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg) may be added at the time of dose escalation up to 
1.0 mg/kg and up to 2.0 mg/kg (eg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg respectively) based on assessment 
by [CONTACT_380739].  Enrollment will continue beyond 
randomization in all dose levels (unless dose level(s) is closed due to safety reasons or lack of 
efficacy as recommended by [CONTACT_40972]) until up to a total of 20 subjects in each 
dose level.  Meetings of the Steering Committee are planned periodically throughout the study to 
review all available safety and e fficacy data.  F or any treatment group, if ≥40% of the subjects

Both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study ar e comprised of the following periods:
Screening – Assessments to be performed up to 28 days prior to enrollment (Day 1).  If 
screening assessments, with the exception of Hgb and blood pressure, are conducted within 7 days of enrollment (Day 1), they  are not required to be rep eated at enrollment (Day 1).  
Hemoglobin and blood pressure must be a ssessed within 8 hours prior to study drug 
administration (or closest time prior to dosing that is logist ically feasible for the study site).
Treatment – Comprised of five complete cycles of 21 days each of treatment on a schedule of 
Q3W.  Subjects requiring ≥4 units of RBC at baseline who fail to demonstrate, after completing 
five cycles of treatment, a decrease ≥4 units of RBC transfused over a period of 8 weeks, 
relative to the units of RBCs transfused in the 8 weeks immediately prior to enrollment (Day 1), 
will discontinue treatment.  Subjects requiring < [ADDRESS_476939] sustained 
Hgb increase by [CONTACT_42334] 5 but for a pe riod less than or equal to 8 consecutive weeks 
(potential late responders) may continue treatmen t for up to an additional three cycles (Cycles 6-
8) for the purpose of meeting response criteria.  Subjects requiring ≥ [ADDRESS_476940] a sustained decrease in transfusion requirements by [CONTACT_42334] 5 but for a period of less than or equal to 8 consecutive w eeks (potential late responders) may also continue 
treatment for up to an additional three cycles (Cycles 6-8).
End of Treatment – Assessments to be conducted upon:
#Completion ( ≥5 cycles) of participation in the Treatment Period of the study, prior
to the first dose of sotatercept in the Extension Period.
#Early (< 5 cycles) termination of participation in the Treatment Period of the study,
after last dose of sotatercept.
Extension – After completion of 5 cycles of treatment (or up to 8 cycles for potential late 
responders), subjects who meet at least one of the criteria listed below may enter the Extension 
Period, subject to Rules for Delay, Reductio n, and Discontinuation of Treatment (Section 8.2.1 ), 
until PD, treatment failure, or other reason, as appropriate, listed in Section 12, Discontinuations.  
HI-E (Non-transfusion-dependent [NTD] subjects) with an increase ≥ 1.5g/dL Hgb from 
baseline, sustained over a period of ≥ 8 consecutive weeks in the absence of RBC transfusions.
HI-E (Transfusion-dependent [T D] subjects) with a decrease ≥ [ADDRESS_476941] a 1.0 g/dL rise in Hgb compared to baseline at the investigator’s 
discretion.
TD subjects exhibiting a 50% reduction in transfusion requirement compared to baseline at the 
investigator’s discretion.
End of Extension – Assessments to be conducted upon completion of participation in the 
Extension Period of the study.
Follow-up – Following the end of treatment (last dose of sotatercept administered) in the 
Treatment Period or the Ex tension Period, follow-up w ill include a pregnancy test approximately&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21of of

approximately [ADDRESS_476943] of sotatercept on hematopoietic endpoints in subjects with low- and 
intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic s yndromes or non-proliferative CMML, by [CONTACT_56623]
(Appendix B ).  The randomized, parallel-group, design is typi[INVESTIGATOR_380723] 2 studies evaluating a 
range of doses for an investigational drug.  Subjects will be ra ndomized to tr eatment groups to 
limit scientific bias within the study.  The dur ation of treatment of 15 weeks (5 cycles) has been
shown to be adequate to assess safety and to demonstrate a pharmacodynamic effect of sotatercept on hematopoietic parameters  in both h ealthy volunteers and p atients.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Dose escalation in 100% incr ement from 0.5 mg/kg to 2.0 mg/kg Q3W is proposed to achieve 
adequate separation in the systemic sotatercept exposure between doses.  This would facilitate 
the evaluation of the dose-response relationship for effectiveness and toxicity as well as to 
minimize the number of subjects exposed to likely sub-therapeutic doses. Intermediate cohorts (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg) may be added at the time of dose escalation up to 1.0 mg/kg and up to 
2.0 mg/kg (eg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.5 mg /kg respectively) based on assessment by [CONTACT_380752].  Three cycles of data in six subjects in the current
dose level will ensure that an adequate amount of safety and efficacy data is available prior to 
dose escalation or treatment group closure at dose levels where limited multi-dose clinical data is available from previous studies (eg, 1.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg).  
Note:  Based on the 02 Mar 2015 Steering Co mmittee’s review of safety, eff icacy and 
pharmacokinetic data of subjects enrolled in the Part 1 dose levels, including the sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort level:
Part 1 - The sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort was closed.  Ongoing and newly enrolled subjects are 
to be dose reduced to sotatercept 1.5 mg/kg.
Part 2 - Subjects enrolled in Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) will receive sotatercept at 1.0 mg/kg.  &(/*(1(35235rorom m 0.5 m0.5

Both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study are comprised of the following periods:
Screening – Assessments to be performed up to 28 days prior to enrollment (Day 1).
Treatment – Comprised of five complete cycles of [ADDRESS_476944] a sustained Hgb increase or a decreased tr ansfusion burden by [CONTACT_42334] 5 but for a 
period less than or equal to 8 consecutive weeks (potential late responders) may continue 
treatment for up to an additional three cycles ( Cycles 6-8) for the purpose of meeting response 
criteria.
Extension – After completing 5 cycles of treatment (or up to 8 cycles for potential late 
responders), subjects who qualify for the Extension Period (refer to Section 4.1.2 ), may enter the 
Extension Period and continue treatment ,subject to Rules for Delay, Reduction, and 
Discontinuation of Treatment (Section 8.2.1 ), until PD, treatment failure, or other reason, as 
appropriate, listed in Section 12, Discontinuations.
Follow-up – Following the End of Treatment (last dose of sotatercept administered) in the 
Treatment Period or the Extension Peri od, follow-up w ill include a pregnancy test approximately
[ADDRESS_476945] treatment, assessmen t of efficacy (ie, Hgb levels, transfusions) 
approximately [ADDRESS_476946] that is required forprimary, secondary  analysis, as pre-specified in the protocol and/or the
Statistical Analysis Plan, whichever is the later date.
The sponsor may decide to end the trial when all key endpoints and objectives of the study have 
been analyzed, and the availability of a roll-over protocol exists into which any subjects who
remain on study may be consented and continue to receive treatment with IP.  It must be the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_380713](s) continue to receive benefit from treatment with IP.  
4.4. Steering Committee
A Steering Committee will be established by [CONTACT_380754].  The Steering Committee will be comprisedof Study Investigators, an Independent Cardiologist, representatives of Celgene, and may include additional ad hoc members.  The Steering Commit tee w ill advise and recommend to the s ponsor:
#Inclusion of the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group in the rando mization scheme, based upon 
the occurrence of DLT (Section 4.1.1 ) in ≤1/5 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 0.1 mg/kg 
and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups and a review  of all available safety  and eff icacy data 
following treatment of five subjects in each of those treatment groups (with the last 
subject for each group having completed at least one cycle of 21 days).&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21may enter thmay enter th

treatment, any SAE related to treatment should be reported.
dIf physical examination, vital signs (except blood pressure), weight, or ECOG performance status were done within [ADDRESS_476955] be assessed 
within 8 hours prior to study drug administration (or closest time prior to dosing that is logistically feasible for the study s ite).  Monitoring of blood pressure may be performed at 
home on nondosing days.  For home monitoring, a plan with instructions and thresholds regarding when to contact [CONTACT_380758].  In the absence of clinically significant changes in blood pressure after five cycles of treatment, monitoring frequency may decrease to 
once per cycle at the investigator’s discretion.  ECG should be  performed during screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, and a t the End of Treatment Period.  In the absence of 
clinically significant changes in ECG readings after completion o f five cycles of treatment, ECGs will no longer be required until  the End of Treatment Period unless deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
eHematology, including CBC with differential and reticulocyte count are done at baseline and weekly during the treatment period.   In the Follow-Up Period, Hematology values
(ie, Hgb levels) will be collected approximately [ADDRESS_476956], to assess potential late response to sotatercept after discontinuation.  
fSerum chemistry includes sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2 (bicarbonate), calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, BUN, creatinine, gluco se, amylase, lipase, albumin, total protein, 
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (total and direct), AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, LDH, creatinine clearance (per Cockcroft-Gault formula) .
hUrinalysis includes albumin (quantitative), bilirubin, creatinine (quantitative), glucose, Hgb, total protein (quantitative), keto nes, pH, albumin/creatinine ratio, protein/creatinine 
ratio, .
iPregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential.  A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) h as not undergone hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in  the preceding 24 consecutive months). Urine or 
serum pregnancy tests must occur within [ADDRESS_476957] occur imm ediately pri or to each treatmen t; approximately 
every 28 days during delays in treatment; at discontinuati on of treatment; and approximately [ADDRESS_476958] treatment.
Note:  Local laboratory assessments are allowed in cases when timely results are needed (eg, randomization, study treatment dos ing decisions, hematology assessments between 
clinic visits).  Whenever possible a “split” sample should also be forwarded to the central laboratory for analysis.  Local lab oratory data should be collected in the eCRF. 
jPharmacokinetics - Blood samples will be collected for assessmen t of pharmacokinetics in all subjects as per the schedule in Table [ADDRESS_476959] treatment. At 
each pharmacokinetics time point, approximately 3 mL blood will be collected and serum prepared 
kAntidrug antibody (ADA) - Blood samples will be collected for assessment of ADA in all subjects.  During the Treatment Period the  sample must be collected prior to each 
administration of sotatercept on days of treatment administration .  During the Extension Period the sample must be collected prior to every other administration of sotatercept on 
days of treatment administration as per the schedule of assessment of pharmacokinetics .  A blood sample will be collected for the assessment of ADA at the end of the Extension 
Period.  At the end of the treatment, assessment of ADA will be repeated every [ADDRESS_476960] treatment.  If a serum sample is provided for assessment of 
pharmacokinetics, the assay for ADA will be performed on that serum sample and an additional sample need not be provided.  If a serum sample is not provided for assessment 
of pharmacokinetics (ie, during the Follow-up Period) a serum sample (  must be 
provided for the assay of ADA.
lMDS response assessment - per International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria in Myelodysplasia ( Appendix C ), to include best response at end of treatment.
mBone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], standard (with iron staining) - for: local assessment of cytogenetics employing standard banding overall and FISH for del (5q) only; preparation of smears
with Wright and Giemsa stain for local and central assessment of cell differential, morphology, and cellularity; standard asses sment by [CONTACT_4133].  For central assessment, 
refer to central lab manual for staining requirements.  During screening, if cytogenetic results from within [ADDRESS_476961] did not receive treatment (including ESAs and steroids) since sample obtainment.  Supportive care (ie, transfusions) sin ce sample obtainment is acceptable.

status were done within [ADDRESS_476966] to sotatercept in the interactive voice response system (IVRS) system
-Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria (Sections 7.2and 7.3) will be stratified and 
randomized utilizing a validated IVRS.  A subject will be randomized to a Treatment 
Group once a unique multi- digit subject identif ication number has been assigned by 
[CONTACT_54537]. Subjects should be  rando mized prior to preparation ) of the first 
treatment (ie, on the same day, if logistically po ssible).  Randomization is not applicable 
in Part 2.  However, the subject should st ill be registered in the IVRS system prior to 
preparation of the first study treatm ent (ie, on the same day, if logist ically possible).

Additional intermediate dose levels may be added (eg, 0.75 mg/kg SC Q3W or 1.5 mg/kg 
SC Q3W, not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg SC Q3W) if recommended by [CONTACT_380769] (Refer to Section 4.1) at time of dose escalation to 1.0 mg/kg and 2.0 
mg/kg respectively).  
Note:  Amendment 4:  Based on the 02 Mar 2015 Steering Committee’s review of safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetic data of subjects enrolled in the Part 1 dose levels, including 
the sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort level:
Part 1 - The sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort was closed.  Ongoing and newly enrolled subjects are 
to be dose reduced to sotatercept 1.5 mg/kg.
Part 2 - Subjects enrolled into Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) will receive sotatercept at 1.0 mg/kg.  
Subjects who have a sustained Hgb increase or a decreased transfusion burden by [CONTACT_380759] 5 but for a period less than or equal to 8 consecutive weeks (potential late responders) 
may continue treatment for up to an additional three cycles (Cycles 6- 8) for the purpose of 
meeting response cr iteria.  After completing the Treatment Period, subjects who qualify for 
the Extension Period (refer to Section 4.1.2 ) may continue treatment in the Extension Period 
until PD or therapeutic failure.  
8.2.1. Rules for Delay, Reduction, and Discontinuation of Treatment
Subjects must have Hgb assessed and results available within 8 hours (or closest time prior 
to dosing that is logistically feasible for the study site) prior to each study drug 
administration.
For subjects who are transfusion independent (ie, transfusion burden of < 4 units of RBCs in 
the eight weeks prior to randomization or enro llment), baseline (ie, Cycle 1 only) pre-dose 
Hgb should be < 9.0 g/dL prior to dosing administration.
Subjects must have blood pressure assessed within 8 hours (or closest time prior to dosing 
that is logistically feasible for the study site) prior to each study drug administrati on.  Blood 
pressure values should be confirmed by [CONTACT_292017] 5 
minutes apart with the patient seated for approximately 10 minutes prior to initial reading.

8.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
8.3.1. Part 1
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_380732] (< 500 versus ≥500 
mIU/mL) and by [CONTACT_380747] 56 days prior to study enrollment (< 4 RBC units 
versus≥4 RBC units), and then assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups wherein they 
will be administered sotatercept, SC, 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg Q3W.  An IVRS will be utilized to 
ensure an equal weight central randomization based on a permuted-block ra ndomization method 
according to stratification factors defined in Section 4.1, Design of Study.  Following treatment 
of five subjects in each of the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups (with the last subject 
for each group having completed at least one cycle of 21 days), all available safety and efficacy 
data will be assessed by a Steering Committee (Section 4.4).  Based upon the occurrence of DLT
(Section 4.1.1 ) in ≤1/5 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups, the 
0.5 mg/kg treatment group will begin inclusion in the randomization scheme.  
Following treatment of at least six subjects in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group (with at least six
subjects having completed at least three cycles of  21 days each), all available safety and efficacy 
data will be assessed by a Steering Committee from all dose levels.  Based upon the occurrence 
of DLT in ≤ 1/6 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group and an acceptable safety 
profile from all dose levels, the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group will begin inclusion in the 
randomizatio n scheme.  
Following treatment of at least six subjects in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group (with at least six
subjects having completed at least three cycles of 21 days each), all available safety and efficacy 
data will be assessed by a Steering Committee from all dose levels.  Based upon the occurrence 
of DLT in ≤ 1/6 subjects in Cycle 1 in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group and an acceptable safety 
profile from all dose levels, the 2.0 mg/kg treatment group will begin inclusion in the 
randomizatio n scheme.  The 2.0 mg/kg so tatercept dose was reduced to 1.5 mg/kg for ongoing 
and newly enrolled subjects (Amendment 4).
Intermediate cohorts (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg) may be added at the time of dose escalation up to 
1.0 mg/kg and up to 2.0 mg/kg (eg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg respectively) based on assessment 
by [CONTACT_380734].  Enrollment will continue beyond

dose level.  
Meetings of the Steering Co mmit tee are planned periodically throughout the study to review all 
available safety and efficacy data.  For any treatment group, if ≥40% of the sub jects (minimum 
four subjects experiencing an event) experience a DLT of related (suspected) adverse event ≥ 
Grade 2 (other than hemoglobin or hypertension DLT as defined in Section 4.1.1 ), the Steering 
Committee may recommend the closure of the treatment group.
In addition, if > 33% of the subjects (minimum two subjects experiencing an event) experience 
hemoglobin > 12 g/dL (not influenced by [CONTACT_27752]),sustained for ≥7 days, confirmed by [CONTACT_380735] ≥1 week apart, the Steering Committee may recommend the closure of the 
treatment group.
Moreover, if > 33% of the subjects (minimum two subjects experiencing an event) experience a 
hypertension DLT (refer to Section 4.1.1 ), the Steering Committee may recommend the closure 
of the treatment group.  In order to harmonize DLT assessment for hypertension across the study, 
additional guidance must be fo llowed as defined in Section 4.1.1 . Additionally, f or any treatment 
group that accrues a minimum of 10 subjects or less if reco mmended by [CONTACT_40972] 
(with the last subject having received at least one complete cycle of 21 days), in the absence of 
any sign of efficacy (defined as an increase of Hgb > 1 g/dL in the absence of transfusion or at 
least a 50% reduction in transfusion requirements if the reduction is less than 4 units), the Steering Committee may recommend the closure of the treatment group.
8.3.2. Part [ADDRESS_476990] frequency of HI-E.
Steering Committee Recommendation 
Based on the 02 Mar 2015 Steering Committee’s review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic 
data of subjects enrolled in the Part 1 dose levels, including the sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort 
level:
Part 1 - The sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort was closed.  Ongoing and newly enrolled subjects are 
to be dose reduced to sotatercept 1.5 mg/kg.
Part 2 - Subjects enrolled into Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) will receive sotatercept at 1.0 mg/kg.  
8.4. Packaging and Labeling
The IP will be lab eled per local regulatory requirements. Additional information may be 
included on the label as applicable per local regulations.
8.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal
Accountability for sotatercept is the responsibility of the investigator.  Investigational clinical 
supplies must be received by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a secured 
location.  The investigational site must maintain  accurate records indicat ing dates and amounts of 
sotatercept received, to whom it was administered (subject-by-subject accounting), and accounts &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21ce

Confidential and Propri etary 77 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: 4 Aug 201510. STATISTICAL ANALYSES
10.1. Overview
This is an open-label, randomized, Phase 2, parallel, dose-ranging, multicenter study of 
sotatercept for the treatment of patients with low- and int-1 risk MDS or non-proliferative 
CMML, with anemia, defined as requiring ≥2 units of RBCs within 84 da ys of study enrollment.  
The study is comprised of 2 parts.  In Part 1, subjects will be assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups wherein they will be admin istered sotatercept, SC, 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg 
Q3W.  Randomization w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_380746] (< 500 versus ≥500 
mIU/mL) and by [CONTACT_380747] 56 days prior to study enrollment (< 4 RBC units 
versus≥4 RBC units).  Enrollment will continue without hiatus beyond randomization of five
subjects into each of the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups.  Following treatment of five
subjects in each of the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups (with the last subject for each group having completed at least one cycle of 21 days), all available safety and efficacy data will 
be assessed by a Steering Committee (Section 4.4).  Based upon the occurrences of DLTs in 
Cycle 1, as described in Section 4.1.1 , the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group may be included into the 
randomization scheme. Initiation of ra ndomization into the 1.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg treatment 
groups w ill have the s ame requirements as initiation of randomization into the 0.5 mg/kg 
treatment group with the exception of requiring at least six subjects completing at least three cycles of 21 days each and all available safety and efficacy data will be assessed by a Steering 
Committee. Meetings of the Steering Committee are planned periodically throughout the study 
to review available safety and efficacy data.  Also, the Steering Committee may meet to review efficacy and safety due to occurrences of DLTs or for lack of efficacy as described in 
Section 4.1.1 .
Intermediate cohorts (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg) may be added at the time of dose escalation up to 
1.0 mg/kg and up to 2.0 mg/kg (eg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg respectively) based on assessment 
by [CONTACT_380775] e level.  Upon completion of up to [ADDRESS_476991] frequency of HI-E.
Note:  Amendment 4:  Based on the 02 Mar 2015 Steering Committee’s review of safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetic data of subjects enrolled in the Part 1 dose levels, including the 
sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort level:
Part 1 - The sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort was closed.  Ongoing and newly enrolled subjects are 
to be dose reduced to sotatercept 1.5 mg/kg.
Part 2 - Subjects enrolled in Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) will receive sotatercept at 1.0 mg/kg.

Confidential and Propri etary 78 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: 4 Aug 201510.2. Definitions of Study Populations
Five study populations w ill be used for analyses.
#The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population ∀All subjects rando mized
#Safety Population ∀All subjects who take at least one dose of study medication
#Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Population ∀All ITT subjects who take at least one dose of 
study medication and have baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of 
efficacy without major deviation from protocol
#Transfusion-dependent E fficacy P opulation (TDE) ∀All subjects in the EE 
population who require a transfusion of > 4 units of RBCs in the 8 weeks prior to 
randomization (Part 1) or start of therapy (Part 2) are transfusion dependent at 
randomization.
#Transfusion-independent Efficacy Population (TIE) – All subjects in the EE 
population who require a transfusion of < 4 units of RBCs in the 8 weeks prior to 
randomization (Part 1) or start of therapy (Part 2) are not transfusion-dependent at 
randomization.
10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
Subjects will be enrolled to provide up to 115 ev aluable subjects in this study (Parts 1 and 2, 
combined).  An evaluable subject is one who meets criteria for HI-E (Section 3.1), or one who 
completes five cycles of [ADDRESS_476993] a sustained Hgb increase or a decreased 
transfusion burden by [CONTACT_42334] 5 but for a period less than or equal to 8 consecutive 
weeks (potential late responders) may continue  treatment for up to an additional three cycles
(Cycles 6-8) for the purpose of meeting response criteria.

weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_145423], while gender, race and other categorical variables will be summarized using frequency tabulations.  Data on medical history will be summarized using frequency tabulations 
by [CONTACT_6657].
10.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_380776]-up periods.  A summary of subjects enrolled by [CONTACT_27707]. Deviations from protocol will be summarized by [CONTACT_380777].
10.6. Analysis of Efficacy
The primary objective of this study is to deter mine a safe, tolerable, and effective dose of 
sotatercept that results in the greatest frequency of HI-E in patients with anemia and low- or int-1risk MDS or non-proliferative CMML.  The primary endpoint of this study is the rate of HI-E
(Appendix C ) starting before the completion of five cycles of treatment.  Subjects who have 
sustained Hgb increase or decreased transfusion burden by [CONTACT_380738] 5 but for a period less than or equal to 8 consecutive weeks (potential  late responders) may continue treatment for up to 
an additional three cycles (Cycles 6-8) for the purpose of meeting response criteria.
#HI-E (TIE) is an increase ≥1.5g/dL Hgb from baseline, sustained over a period of ≥8 
consecutive weeks in the absence of RBC transfusion; 
or
#HI-E (TDE) is a decrease ≥4 units of RBCs transfused over a period of 8 consecutive 
weeks, relative to the number of units of RBCs transfused in the 8 weeks immediately prior to Day 1.
Erythroid hematological improvement (HI-E) response rates will be presented separately for TIE 
and TDE subjects. The HI-E response rate and other binary endpoints will be summarized using &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,[ZIP_CODE]$7$777$7$70$75$7$70$$7

Confidential and Propri etary 80 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: 4 Aug 2015a point estimate and 95% CI.  
The secondary endpoints of efficacy of this study are:
1. Achievement of transfusion-independence in transfusion-dependent subjects 
(Appendix C ).
2. Time to HI-E ( Appendix C ); the time between randomization (Part 1) and the start of 
therapy (Part 2) and the date the start of HI-E.
3. Duration of HI-E ( Appendix C ); the length of time between the first assessment and the 
last assessment the subject was in HI-E response for subjects who had an HI-E response. 
If the subject had an HI-E response that continued at the subject’s last assessment, the duration will be censored at the last assessment.
4. Time to progression to AML (TPAML); the time between rando mization (Part 1) and 
start of therapy (Part 2) a nd the date of progression to AML ( Appendix C ).  If a subject 
dies prior to progression, the subject will be censored at the date of death.  If a subject 
does not have a progression to AML, the subject will be censored at the last assessment.
5. Time to progression to events of higher risk MDS (TTPHR); the time between 
randomization (Part 1) and start of therapy (Part 2) and d ate of progression to events of 
higher risk MDS (eg, int-2 or high risk IPSS, Appendix B ).  If a subject dies due to 
reasons other than progression to events of higher risk MDS, the subject will be censored at the death date.  If a subject does not have progression to events of higher risk MDS, 
then the subject will be censored at the last assessment.
6. Progression-free survival (PFS) - the time between randomization (Part 1) and start of 
therapy (Part 2) and PD ( Appendix C ) or death.  Subjects who progress or die will be 
considered to have had an event, except if this event occurs after the start of subsequent 
therapy for MDS, in which case the subject is censored at the time of last assessment of 
MDS prior to or on the first day of the first subsequent therapy for MDS.  The date of 
progression is taken as the earliest date of:  date of PD as evaluation of response, death 
date, if death is caused by [CONTACT_4002], treatment termination date if reason is PD, progression date as documented on treatment termination page, progression date as documented on 
the follow-up visit page.  Subjects who do not progress or die (lost to follow-up or still 
being treated without documented PD or started subsequent antitumor therapy) will be censored at the date of the last assessment of MDS.
7. Overall survival (OS) - the time between rando mization (Part 1) and start of therapy (Part 
2) and death.  A subject, who dies regardless of the cause of death, will be considered to have had an event.  All subjects who are lost  to the follow-up prior to the end of the study 
or who are withdrawn from the study will be censored at the time of last contact.  
Subjects who are still being treated will be censored at the last available date when the subject was known to be alive.
8. Concentration of sotatercept in serum (Section 10.9).
For duration and time-to-event data, the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the 
distribution function.  For continuous data, descriptive statistics will be provided.  Data listings

Sotatercept (ACE-011)
Protocol ACE-011-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 81 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_476995] one dose of study medication will be included in analyses of safety.  Exposure to sotatercept will be summarized.  Adverse events, DLTs, vital signs, clinical laboratory information, ECG interpretations, and concomitant medications will be tabulated and 
summarized overall and by [CONTACT_64240].  The incidence of AEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_380778] 4.0 (c urrent active minor version).  The incidence of 
deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to dose modif ications and discontinuati ons of study treatment 
will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_64240].  Safety i nformation obtained during 
treatment, post-treatment ([ADDRESS_476996] dose), and during follow-up will be provided for these analyses.  Laboratory results will be  summarized by [CONTACT_380779].
10.8. Interim Analysis
In Part 1, following treatment of five subjects in each of the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment 
groups (with the last subject for each group having completed at least one cycle of 21 days), all 
available safety and efficacy data will be  assessed by a Steering Committee (Section 4.4).  
Enrollment will continue without hiatus beyond rando mization of five sub jects into each of the 
0.1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg treatment groups.  Based upon the occurrences of DLTs in Cycle 1 as 
described in Section 4.1.1 , the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group may be included into the 
randomizatio n scheme.  Initiation of rando mization into the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group will have 
the same requirements as initiation of randomization into the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group with the 
exception of requiring at least six subjects enrolled in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group completing 
at least three cycles of 21 days each.  Initiation of rando mization into the 2.0 mg/kg treatment
group will have the same requirements as initiation of randomization into the 1.0 mg/kg 
treatment group.  Meetings of th e Steering Committee are planned periodically throughout the 
study to review available safety and efficacy data.  Also, the Steering Committee may meet to review efficacy and safety due to occurrences of DLTs or for lack of efficacy as described in 
Section 4.1.1 .
Intermediate cohorts (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg) may be added at the time of dose escalation up to 
1.0 mg/kg and up to 2.0 mg/kg (eg, 0.75 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg respectively) based on assessment 
by [CONTACT_380775] e level.  Upon completion of up to 20 evaluable 
subjects in each of the treatment groups (Part 1), analyses will be conducted in order to evaluate 
the safety profile of sotatercept and identify the dose that results in the greatest frequency of 
HI-E.
Note:  Amendment 4:  Based on the 02 Mar 2015 Steering Committee’s review of safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetic data of subjects enrolled in the Part 1 dose levels, including the 
sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort level:
Part 1 - The sotatercept 2.0 mg/kg cohort was closed.  Ongoing and newly enrolled subjects are 
to be dose reduced to sotatercept 1.5 mg/kg.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21e of of

Confidential and Propri etary 83 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: 4 Aug 201511. ADVERSE EVENTS
11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be considered an AE .  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the CRF rather than the indi vidual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndrome. 
An overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE, or abuse, 
withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an AE.  If an overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and adverse event should be reported as 
separate terms.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or surgical fi ndings, physical examination findings, or other 
appropriate tests and procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_380780] 
[ADDRESS_476998]’s source documents.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, 
using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:
11.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:
#Results in death;
#Is life-threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
#Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);
#Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
#Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
#Constitutes an important medical event.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21ny

require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
#A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72612] a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
#Routine treatment or monitoring of the st udied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
#The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
#A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27590] a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
#Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
#A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on st udy); must 
be documented in the source document and the CRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication remains a reportable SAE.
#An elective treatment of a pre-existing condition unrelated to the studied indication. 
#Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the investigator will provide i nformation on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator must assess the severity /intensity of the event.The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the current 
active minor version of NCI CTCAE Version 4.0; 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE shoul d be evaluated for severity according to the

Sotatercept (ACE-011)
Protocol ACE-011-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 85 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: 4 Aug 2015#Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
#Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
#Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]
#Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitati on in activity, si gnificant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380725]
#Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality 
The investigator must determine the relationshi p between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP 
administration is unlikely or remote ; or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provide d by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].
11.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
11.2.5. Action Taken
The investigator will report the action taken with IP  as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation or reduction of IP, as  appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or 
additional treatments were  given for the event. &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21spi[INVESTIGATOR_380726]

Protocol ACE-011-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 86 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_477000]’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered (death due to another 
cause) or death (due to the SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
#results in discontinuation from the study;
#requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
#is judged to be of significant clinical importance.
Regardless of severity grade, onl y laboratory abnormalities that  fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/scr een of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE.
11.4. Pregnancy
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within [ADDRESS_477001]’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately re portable events.  IP is to be discontinued 
immediately.  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported 
to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equiv alent form.  
The female subject may be referred to an obstetr ician-gynecologist (not necessarily one with 
reproductive toxicity experience) or another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation.
The investigator will follow the f emale subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow- up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any 
of the serious criteria, it must be reported as  an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or 
other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_477002] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21eutic tic

event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
subject taking IP should notify the investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be 
advised to call their healthcare provider immediately.
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets a criterion for an SAE re quires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE report s as well as any follow-up reports.
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
(from the time the s ubject signs informed consent up to and including [ADDRESS_477003] 
study treatment), and those made known to the investigator at anytime thereafter that are 
suspected of being related to IP.  SAEs occurring prior to treatment will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include summaries of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a subject died and an autopsy has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_27599] d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of 
the SAE and providing them with all relevant init ial and follow-up information about the event. 
The investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_198476]/EC.
11.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by [CONTACT_648].
11.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to so tatercept based on the Investigator Brochure.
In the [LOCATION_002], all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics

[CONTACT_380789]. This documentation mu st also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose 
the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. 
Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number (if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be 
officially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21the the

Summary of Changes ACE-011-MDS-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 ACE-011-MDS-001 Amendment 2 Final: 13 Feb [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below.
The following changes are based on feedback received from the Steering Committee, study 
investigators, and site staff upon review of Amendment 1 of protocol ACE-011-MDS-001 in forums such as the Steering Committee Kick-Off Meeting, Investigator Meeting, Site Initiation 
Visits, or site ad hoc review of the protocol:
!Add clarification related to the hypertension dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) definition to 
ensure harmonization of DLT assessment for hypertension across all study sites due to 
unique attributes of th e study population.  
!Provide clear parameters for Extension Period eligibility to offer flexibility for those 
subjects who do not meet protocol-defined er ythroid hematological improvement (HI-E) 
to enter the Extension Period, at the investigator’s discretion, if clinical benefit is seen at 
the conclusion of the Treatment Period.  
!Remove the Cycle 3 Day 1 mandatory MDS response assessment as it is deemed too 
soon after initiation of treatment of study drug.
!Continue to follow efficacy parameters (ie Hgb and transfusions) for up to [ADDRESS_477021] dose of study drug or start of next treatment to assess potential late response after 
study drug discontinuation as is somet imes observed with erythroid stimulating agents 
(ESAs).
!Modify the adverse event reporting period to [ADDRESS_477022] dose is administered
(regardless of causality) to account for the lik elihood that the subject will begin 
additional cytotoxic treatment after treatment discontinuation.  Beyond [ADDRESS_477023] ill be re ported.
!Include chromosome del5q MDS patients who have failed on lenolidomide, intolerable to 
lenalidomide, or have other cytopenia precluding use of lenalidomide, as these patients 
could potentially benefit from  treatment with sotatercept.
The following changes are based on  
 review of Amendment 1 of protocol ACE-011-MDS-001:
!Increase the frequency of blood pressure monitoring from once per cycle to weekly 
during the first 5 cycles of treatment, with the added flexibility of home monitoring.  
!Addition of an Independent Cardiologist to  the Steering Committee to  focus on potential 
cardiovascular effects of the study drug.
!Increase the contraception use requirement for males after the last administration of study 
drug from 112 days to 7 months/210 days to account for the limited data on the study drug’s effect on spermatogenesis.

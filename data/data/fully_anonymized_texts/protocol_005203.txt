Surgical site infection (SSI) after spi[INVESTIGATOR_393505] a devastating complication.  It is classified as a “never 
event” by [CONTACT_148738], because it is presumed to be the result of a lapse in quality. A mainstay of SSI 
prevention is antibiotic treatment, but antibiotic concentrations are lower in bone tissue than blood 
levels. Because of this, there has been increasing interest in the use of in tra-wound a ntibiotics (IWA) 
placed directly on the spi[INVESTIGATOR_393506]. However, because 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_393507], it remains to  be determined if the broad use of IWA would actually decrease 
rates of spi[INVESTIGATOR_393508].  
The goal of this study was to better understand  surgeon practices and beliefs around in tra-wound 
antibiotics.  The Comparative Effectiveness Research Translation Network ( CERTAIN ) Spi[INVESTIGATOR_393509], identify knowledge gaps around IWA, 
and design further research  and implementation tools to support IWA adoption as appropriate.   
OBJECTIVES  
Compare knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about IWA with the actual use of IWA by [CONTACT_14085].  
Rationale: Assessing barriers to increasing IWA use is critical to an eventual trial. Commonly, educational 
gaps drive variability in practice but beliefs and attitudes may also contribute. Additionally, assessing 
variability in how IWA is used may reveal bias and confounding that will need to be addressed in a trial 
and require the additio n of other surveillance metrics. To assess this, we will perform a survey of all WA 
State spi[INVESTIGATOR_393510], attitudes, and behaviors related to the use of IWA, and 
compare gaps in knowledge with historic IWA use patterns. We hypothesiz e that surgeons who use IWA 
more often have more knowledge about IWA than less frequent users.  
DESIGN  
The estimated [ADDRESS_493916] for IWA 
was needed, and if they would be willing to participate and randomize their patients.  
The study team conducted a research prioritization workshop  at the SCOAP Annual Conference in 2017.  
This exer cise was to better understand what types of research and what areas of research current 
clinicians and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393511]. The prioritization exercise involved a 
brief survey given to attendees at a breakout session during the c onference, followed by [CONTACT_393516].  
The goal of the second strategy was to get a more in depth understanding of the results we found in the  
original surgeon survey  via interviews that included questions about 1) use patterns of IWA, 2) opi[INVESTIGATOR_393512], 3) its effectiveness to reduce SSI, and 4) best practices for evidence 
generation in clinical practice. Interviews lasted about 20 -30 minutes and were conducted with a 
qualitative research coo rdinator. The interviews were split into two parts, 1) gaining a deeper 
understanding of IWA use, scientific evidence, and evidence generation in surgical practice, and 2) 
review 2-3 case scenarios  for how evidence could be generated for IWA use.  
Particip ating surgeons were notified that they could skip any questions if they were uncomfortable 
answering and were asked if they would be willing to be recorded for data collection purposes. 
Interviews were then transcribed and reviewed for themes.  
METHODS  
Surgeons recruited from s ix surgical professional organizations  agreed to participate in the study, 
including: Seattle Science Foundation ONE Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Washington State Orthopaedic A ssociation, North 
American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_129825] , Cervical Spi[INVESTIGATOR_129827], Lu mbar Spi[INVESTIGATOR_129827], and Surgical 
Clinical Outcomes Assessment Program. Within these organizations  91 surgeons participated.

LIKELY IMPACT  
The results of this study will support the design and conduct of a cRCT within the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_318081] P-CERTAIN 
network and/or inform other researchers considering such a t rial. Ultimately, this study should 
determine the effectiveness of adding IWA to standard infection prevention regimens to avoid SSI after 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477]. Demonstrating that IWA is effective would represent a major shift in the practice of spi[INVESTIGATOR_393515].

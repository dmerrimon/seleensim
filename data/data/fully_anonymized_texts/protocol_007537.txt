a: Changes introduced to Amendment 05 which are relevant to Amendment 06 are included in the Summary of Changes for 
Amendment 06.  
b: Amendment 05 was signed by [CONTACT_837650] [INVESTIGATOR_837612]. Amendment 05 was 
not submitted to any Regulatory Authorities or Ethics Commitees, nor was it circulated to any study centres. 
Amendment 0 6 28 Febr uary 2020 
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Overall Rationale for Amendment  [ADDRESS_1163323] been increased ; the intent is to continue 
Study [ADDRESS_1163324] no suitable treatment 
options for their invasive fungal disease and are ineligible for the Phase III study will be able 
to enrol into Study 32 and receive treatment with F901318.  
An initial analysis was been added after 100 patient; F901318 has been granted Breakthrough 
Therapy Designation based on preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates F901318 may 
provide substantial improvement over available therapy. As this designation is intended to expedite the development and review of important products, an initial analysis of data will be 
performed w hen the first [ADDRESS_1163325] completed treatment, to enable the Sponsor to 
formally consider the possibility that initial approval might be achievable based on the data for 
the population of patients with limited or no treatment options for life -threatening fungal 
infections.  
Body -weight adjustment of the F901318 dos e has been removed; Population pharmacokinetic 
(PK) modelling has predicted that use of body weight- adjusted dosing increases the between -
patient  variability in systemic exposure (as the effect of body weight on F901318 PK  is 
relatively small, dose adjustment by [CONTACT_837651]). As a

the use of concomitant medications require s dose adjustment.  
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is being removed

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment 06 final 28Feb2020  Confidential  Probable invasive a spergillosis  (IA) will be enrolled in the study and receive treatment with F901318.  For 
patients who have n on-LTRD IA (Tracheobronchitis, Sinonasal infection , Central Nervous System 
infection) , only patients with P roven non -LRTD IA can be enrolled.  
Patients will be treated until they reach a defined treatment endpoin t, up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1163327]  a success ful overall outcome  on Days 78 to 
83 of treatment (and hence requir ing 85 to 90 days of total treatment ) are eligible to receive up to 90 days of 
treatment  in the main study  phase  (90 days is the maximum duration of the nonclinical safety toxicology 
studies).  In addition,  at the I nvestigator’s request  and after discussion  with the Medical Monitor (MM) , 
open -label  treatment with F901318 may be continued beyond Day s 84 to 90 in patients who are judged by 
[CONTACT_837652] 84 days and who are considered likely to continue to benefit from 
extended treatment  (ET). The I nvestigator’ s request to extend  treatment with F901318 must  be approved by 
[CONTACT_303766]. For patients who are to receive ET  with F901318, the End of Treatment (EOT) and End of Study 
(EOS) for the main study  phase  are taken as the day on which therapy is completed  under the main study  
phase (Days 1 to 84- 90) of this protocol . 
The recommended regimen for adults who are not being treated with medications that either inhibit or 
induce CYP enzymes  will be a 1 day  oral loading dose regimen  of 150 mg  F901318 twice daily (bid) , dosed 
12±1  hours apart, followed by a n oral  maintenance dose regimen of 90 mg bid, dosed 12±1 hours apart , for 
Day 2 onwards . Based upon emerging data from both this study and from studies in healthy volunteers, the 
recomm ended maintenance dose regimen for oral dosing may be revised to tota l daily dosages of up to 
300 mg divided into two doses . Current guidance will be given by [CONTACT_837653].  
Efficacy and safety endpoints will be formally assessed at Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Day 42 , Day 84/EOT 
main study phase and 4 weeks after EOT in the main study phase  (4-week follow -up [FU]). Patients are to 
attend the
se core study visits, even if treatment has been discontinued before these visits due to a successful 
outcome . For patients who will  receive ET beyond Day 84- 90, the Day 84 visit, the EOS visit,  and the main 
study  phase EOT visit will be combined into a single Day 84/EOS /EOT visit during the window  Day 84-90. 
An ET -EOT visit will occur on the day that ET dosing stops and will be followed by [CONTACT_837654] -EOS follow -up 
visit that will occur 4 weeks after dosing stops under the ET phase of this protocol . 
The efficacy and safety of treatment with F901318  will be assessed  after
 the Day 84/Day [ADDRESS_1163328] 
Probable  LRTD  IA. Proven IFD or P robable LRTD  IA will be  based on the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infection s Cooperative Group and the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group  (EORTC/MSG ) criteria.   
Patients will initially be assigned by [CONTACT_837655] , based on the nature 
of the IFD :  
1. Lomentospora ( Scedosporium ) prolificans  (LoPro),  
2. Scedosporium  spp.,  
3. Aspergillus  spp.,  
4. Other F901318- susceptible fungi (as described in the Investi gator’s brochure [IB])  
5. Probable LRTD  IA. 
Patie
nts with Probable LRTD  IA must meet the EORTC/MSG requirements for high risk host factor , 
clinical features and mycological criteria.  Patients with Probable LRTD  IA may be re -assigned to the 
Proven category if the infection is subsequently proven.   
Patients will also have limited treatment options based on meeting one or more of the following c riteria : 
a) Known or predicted resistance of the infecting isolate to all licensed agents . LoPro  automatically 
meets this criterion . 
b) Failure of available therapy.  Failure to improve based on clinical or radiologic grounds despi[INVESTIGATOR_837613] ≥[ADDRESS_1163329] antifungal treatment AND alternative  licensed agents are either predicted 
to be ineffective or are contraindicated.

abstain from sexual inter course or use a highly effective  means of 
contraception throughout study participation and agree to continue its use for 
30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743]. 
6) Patients with confirmed  Proven  IFD (based on EORTC/MSG criteria) in the 
following categories *:  
a)  Lomentospora ( Scedosporium ) prolificans  (LoPro),  
b)  Scedosporium  spp.,

*Enrol ment is based on presumed F901 [ADDRESS_1163330] one fungus is known or predicted to be F901318- susceptible 
AND the patient has limited alternative treatment options for that fungus as 
defined in Inclusion Criterion 7. As a specific example, a patient with 
simultaneous IA due to a n azole- resistant strain and also  invasive 
mucormycosis could be enrolled and treated w ith the combi nation of F901318 
and isavuconazole. The choice of addit ional agents to treat other  fungi should 
also consider the limitations applied to allowed medications . Cases of 
polyfungal infection should be discusse d with the MM . 
7) Patients will ALSO  have limited alternative treatment options based on meeting 
one or more of the following  criteria : 
a) Known or predicted resistance of the infecting isolate to all licensed agents . LoPro  autom atically meets this criterion.  
b) Failure of available therapy.  Failu re to improve based on clinical or 
radiologic grounds despi[INVESTIGATOR_837614] [ADDRESS_1163331] antifungal treatment AND alternative  licensed agents are either predicted to be 
ineffective or are contraindicated , 
c) Intolerance to available therapy.  Current therapy cannot be continued 
due to therapy -related adverse reactions (e.g., increase in serum creatinine 
above ULN  with an amphoterici n, persistent visual disturbances with 
voriconazole, allergic reaction with any compound, or other recognized drug-related AE) AND alternative  licensed agents are either predicted to 
be ineffective or are contraindicated ,  
d) Inability to manage DDIs.  Inability to continue current therapy due to 
DDIs that cannot be managed AND alternative  licensed agents are either 
predicted to be ineffective or are contraindicated,  
e) Inability to produce therapeutic drug levels. Inability to produce or maintain therapeutic blood levels with current therapy AND alternative  
licensed agents are either predicted to be ineffective or are contraindicated

infecting isolate,  
ii) Azole -resistance is predicted by [CONTACT_837656], 
iii) Azole -resistance is suspected based on epi[INVESTIGATOR_837615] (e.g., development of aspergillosis while on mould- active 
azole prophylaxis; history of lack of response to a mould- active azole 
at an early point in the therapeutic course),  
iv) An azole would be acceptable therapy but it i s known or predicted 
that unmanageable DDIs will occur  
g) Other  MM agreed inclusion. Patient does not meet any of criteria a) to 
f), but treatment with F901318 is judged appropriate by [CONTACT_737].  
Inclusion of patients based on this category must be agreed with the MM 
and the rationale must be documented.   
Exclusion Criteria:  1) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  
2) Known history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or any serious reaction to any 
component of the study drug. 
3) Patients with chronic aspergillosis, aspergilloma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis .  
4) Suspected zygomycosis  (mucormycosis) as the IFD  used to qualify for the 
study . Evidence for the presence of F901318 non -susceptible filamentous 
fungi such as Muc orales  should be urgently followed up . Increased vigilance 
for the possibility of zygomycosis  is required for suspected IA with negative 
baseline GM. 
5) Microbiological findings (e.g. , bacterial, virological) or other potential 
conditions that are temporally related and suggest a different aetiology for the 
clinical features.  
6) HIV infection but not currently receiving antiretroviral therapy . In cases where 
HIV infection is first diagn osed at the same time as the invasive fungal 
infection, if antiretroviral therapy  is commenced at the time of enrol ment, then 
such patients are eligible for  enrolment.  
7) Any known or suspected condition of the patient that may jeopardize 
adherence to the protocol requirements or impede the accurate measurement of 
efficacy (e.g. neutropenia not expected to resolve,  patients with uncontrolled 
malignancy who are treatment refractory and receiving only palliative therapy). 
8) Patients with a concomitant medical condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , may be an u nacceptable additional risk to the patient should he / 
she participate in the study.  
9) Patients previously enrolled in a study with F901318.  
10) Treatment with any investigational drug in any clinical trial within the [ADDRESS_1163332] administration o f study drug  except for unblinded protocols 
(e.g. open -label oncological regimen variations  or biologic studies ). Prior to 
enrolling patients that are on other open- label studies it is the site’s 
responsibility to ensure that the study criteria for that study allow for enrolment into this study.
 
11) Patients receiving treatment limited to supportive care due to predicted short survival  time. 
12) Patients with a baseline prolongation of QTcF ≥500 msec, or  at high risk for 
QT/QTc prolongation, e.g.  
a) a family history of long QT syndrome  
b) other known pro -arrhythmic conditions  
c) risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (e.g. uncompensated heart failure, abnormal plasma potassium or magnesium levels that cannot be corrected, 
an unstable cardiac condition during the last 30 days)

laboratory parameters at Screening:  
a) Total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_1163333]   
b) Alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase ≥ [ADDRESS_1163334].  
c) Patients with known cirrhosis or chronic hepatic failure.  
14) Prohibited concomitant medications. Concomitant administration of inhibitors 
of human DHODH ( teriflunomide and le flunomide ) is prohibited . There are 
currently no other absolutely prohibited conco mitant medications but there are 
medications  with potentially  significant DDI s and the  manage ment of potential 
interactions should be considered before study enrolment . 
15) Additional exclusion criteria  required by [CONTACT_31665] . 
Duration of Treatment:  Duration of treatment  in the main study  phase of this study is limited to 90 days 
and will be at the discretion of the Investigator  based on the site and  severity of the 
IFD, the patient’s underlying disease, and the rate of clinical response.  All patients 
should receive treatment for  at least [ADDRESS_1163335], Dose and Mode of Administration:  F901318 will be provided as an oral formulation.  
This is  a Phase IIb protocol and the dosing regimen for F901318 may  be updated 
during the study. T he dosing  regim en for adults who are not being treated with 
medications that either inhibit or induce CYP enzymes  will be a  1-day oral loading  
dose regimen of 150 mg F901318 bid, dosed 12 ±1 hours  apart , followed  by a 
maintenance dose regimen of 90 mg bid, dosed 12±[ADDRESS_1163336] study in which F901318 has been administered to 
patients, the target dosing regimen may need to be re vised based upon emerging 
data,  to ensure that the majority of patients achieve target plasma levels from the 
start of treatment.  The revision to target doses will be  captured in the Dose 
Guidance Manual . The dosage regimen  will be  determined from the Dose 
Guidance Manual (and following discussion with the MM if necessary) . 
• An adjustment to loading and/or maintenance doses of F901318 may be 
required for patients who are being treated with drugs that either inhibit or 
induce CYP enzymes (or if such drugs are started or stopped ); treatment of 
these patients must be discussed with the MM.  
• An adjustment to the maintenance dose of F901318 may be required if patients 
develop abnormal liver enzymes ; treatment of these patients must be discussed 
with the MM .  
• Based upon clinical evaluation of efficacy by [CONTACT_737], stepwise increases of maintenance doses of F901318 (to 120 mg bid then 150 mg bid) 
may be permitted, following discussion with the  MM.  
No dietary restrictions around ti me of dosing will be applied, although timing of 
meal s or enteral feedings prior  to each trough PK sample, and prior to and during 
Intensive PK sampling will be documented .  
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  This is an open- label study  and results will be compared with  historical data.  
Concomitant medication: Concomitant administration of teriflunomide and leflunomide is prohibited. There 
are no other absolutely prohibited or contraindicated medications. H owever , there 
are potential DDI s with F901318 and the choice of concomitant medications 
should take this into consideration. The impact of 
F901318 upon cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A4 has been shown to be mild ; transplant drugs and other medications 
which are sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and with potential DDI liability will, where 
possible , be monitored, and changes in drug treatment will be recorded.  Use of 
concomitant medications that may affect  the PK profile  of F901318 must be

sampling  (for rapid PK analysis of F901318) will occur 3  to 5 days after starting or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_837616], to  support evaluation of potential DDIs .  
Concomitant treatment with cytostatic anti -cancer agents (initiation or continuation 
of treatment) is acceptable, provided assessment of study endpoints is expected to 
be feasible based on the Investigator s clinical judgement, potential im pact on 
adherence to study procedures and endpoints, and the lack of treatment 
alternatives. Concomitant treatment with cytostatic anti -cancer agents must be 
discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_303766].  
Data to date suggest that F901318 does not prolong the QTc interval, and 
concomitant agents with known potential to prolong the QTc interval may  be used  
with caution. Ongoing therapy with an agent known to have a risk of QT prolongation is not a contraindication for enrol ment provided the patient meets the 
require ments of E xclusion Criterion 12. After enrol ment, initiation of new 
concomitant treatmen t with known QTc -prolonging agent s must be discussed with 
and approved by [CONTACT_303766] . 
Concomitant Antifungal Therapy:  In order to meaningfully analyse  the efficacy of F901 318, it is important to avoid 
concomitant use of other systemic antifungal agents with known or potential activity against the primar y fungal infection. The constraints on the choice of 
additional agents may be complex and thus u se of any other systemic concomitant 
antifungal or combination treatment (such as addition of terbinafine for confirmed 
Lomentospora prolificans  infections  or an echinocandin to manage infection due to 
Candida) is permitted but is discouraged . 
Antifungal combinations should be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgement 
and must be discussed with the MM.
 
Depending on the treatment given, an extra visit for Unscheduled Trough PK 
sampling (for rapid PK  analysis of F901318) may be required  3 to 5 days afte r 
starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_837617] , to support evaluation of  
potential DDIs .

be included in the data analyses and presented in the clinical study report  (CSR) . Data collected during ET  
will not be included in the data analyses or in the CSR, and will be presented in the  report addendum. 
Analyses will be made using the overall study population and within the DRC -adjudicated baseline disease  
categories , and will be descriptive in nature. Data will be presented using appropriate summary statistics.  
Categorical data will be described using absolute and relative frequencies (n and %).  Continuous data will 
be presented using descriptive statistics ( n, mean, standard deviation , minimum, median, and maximum).  
All variables will be listed in individual patient listings, sorted by [CONTACT_715025] -adjudicated baseline disease  
category and patient number.  
Given the various patient su b-groups included in this study data may  be summarised in the following 
groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]:  
a) Efficacy for all patients . 
b) Efficacy by [CONTACT_837660] -adjudicated  infection category (the 5 categories of I nclusion 
Criterion  6). 
c) Efficacy by [CONTACT_837661] ( CNS, b one, lung/si nus, skin/subcutaneous, other, d isseminated ). 
d) Efficacy by [CONTACT_837662] ( haematological malignancy, allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant, solid organ  transplant , diabetes, active malignant disease, neutropenia at diagnosis, 
glucocor ticoid use, T -cell immunosuppressant use, renal dysfunction ). 
e) Efficacy by [CONTACT_837663] ( no prior therapy; progression or lack of response to prior 
therapy; partial response to prior therapy but alternative continued therapy is needed; complete 
clinical response to prior therapy but alternative continued therapy is needed).  
f) Efficacy by [CONTACT_837664]  (objective marker of active disease 
status such as radiological finding, physical examination finding).  
. Details on sub -group 
anal
yses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Patients wit
h complete clinical response to study drug treatment  will also be evaluated for rel apse of the 
treated IFD and for newly emergent IFD at selected study visits up to the main study  phase EOT visit ( Day 
84 to Day 90) . 
In the event that  a patient is judged to have active disease that merits treatment but where a baseline 
objective marker  of active infection does not exist, said patient will be evaluated only for safety.  Any 
efficacy data from such patients will be listed only.  
All other patients will be evaluated for response.  
Efficacy Analys es: 
Based on the DRC -adjudicated overall response categorized as Success/Failure a response rate will be

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_1163348] in deep tissues of biopsy or needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_837619]-pathological examination c an be described as 
an invasive fungal disease (IFD ) (Ascioglu 2002). R adiological eviden ce of lesions with 
culture positive for the presence of fungi also confirms the IFD. Clinical features of IFD are 
variable, and include febrile illness that continues even after prolonged broad -spectrum 
chemoprophylaxis. Invasive fungal infections are a growing clinical concern in many settings 
but are especially common in immunocompromised patients, can involve any part of the body, 
and are associated with high mortality  rates  (Xie 2008).  
Fungi with the potential to cause invasive  infections include y easts and moulds. Of these, the 
mould fungi from the genera Aspergillus  and Scedosporium  represent particular threats, 
especially to immunosuppressed individuals.  
Aspergillus  spp. are ubiquitous filamentous fungi found in organic matter and in the 
environment. Aspergillus  infection may cause a broad spectrum of disease in the human host, 
ranging from hypersensitivity reactions to direct invasion of tissue (Denning, 1998). Inva sive 
aspergillosis  (IA)  is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_10480], often fatal infection that occurs in patients who are 
severely immunocompromised. The triazole antifungals (especially voriconazole) are often 
effective and have emerged as standard of care for IA. However,  reports of genetically distinct 
but hard to identify Aspergillus  species (so -called cryptic Aspergillus  species) with intrinsic 
resistance mechanisms (Lamoth 2016), as well as clinical cases of Aspergillus fumigatus  
infection with mutational resistance, most likely caused by [CONTACT_837666], have raised concern about the limited alternative current treatment options (Garcia-Rubio 2017). This is especially problematic as the triazole antifungals are the only available 
oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_837620]. When the triazoles are predicted to be inactive because they 
have already been used as prophylaxis or prior treatment or when resistance to azoles is proven, patients are limited to prolonged and toxic therapy with an amphotericin B (polyene ) 
preparation (Lamoth 2017). 
Scedosporium  spp. are ubiquitously present in the environment. They cause a wide spectrum 
of infections in man  ranging from classical subcutaneous infections, like mycetoma with 
spread via the lymphatic system, to disseminated infections with central nervous system 
involvement. Invasive scedosporiosis (IS)  is considerably less frequent than IA, but increasing 
numbers of cases are report ed (Tortorano 2014). Scedosporium  spp. infections are known for 
their special neurotropic nature and their high rate of therapeutic failures and relapses.  In 
particular, Scedosporium  (Lomentospora) prolificans  represents a pan -antifungal- resistant

2009, Kelly 2016). 
Other “uncommon” moulds which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_837621]/or 
polyenes include Rasamsonia species as well as Acremonium , Scopulariopsis , Microascus , 
and Paecilomyces  species.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_837622], the mortality rate in immunocompromised patient s with IFD is a pproximately 50% (Nivoix 2008). Currently marketed antifungal drugs 
for the treatment of IFD target the fungal cell membrane by [CONTACT_837667] (the triazoles, such  as voriconazole), by [CONTACT_837668] (1,3)- β-D-glucan 
(echinocandins, such as caspofungin) or by [CONTACT_837669] (the polyene Amphotericin B [ AMB ]) (Magill 2008). Each of these 3 classes of 
treatment has  limitations including limited dosage forms, drug -drug interactions ( DDI) and 
significant adverse reactions.  The detection of an increasing incidence of azole- resistant 
Aspergillus  spp. (ECDC  2013) is of particular concern since triazoles, including the gold 
standard treatment voriconazole, have been the agents of choice in life- threatening IA  and the 
only oral agents available. R esistance to the triazoles  approaches 30% in some regions 
(Verweij  2016). Treatment options for IS are even more limited with intrinsic resistance to 
polyenes and no current agent with reliable activity against Lomentospora prolificans , one of 
the causative agents of IS (Ro driguez -Tudela 2009, Kelly  2016). 
There is a critical medical need for an antifungal agent with a novel mechanism of action and  
with high efficacy against a broad spectrum of fungal species. Such an agent would have 
added value if it were effective by [CONTACT_138838] (IV) and oral routes of admi nistration,  was 
well tolerated, and had a limite d potential for DDI s. In addition, a predictable and reliable PK 
profile  would allow well controlled therapy. 
2.1.2  F901318 has potential to address that unmet need  
F901318, also known as 2-(1, 5- dimethyl -3-phenyl-1H- pyrrol -2-yl)-N-{4- [4-(5-fluoro -
pyrimidin -2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_9482] -1-yl]-phenyl}-2-oxo- acetamide, is the first of a new class of 
antifungal agents. F901318 has a novel , well  defined mechanism of action, inhibiting a rate 
limiting enzyme  of fungal pyrimidine biosynthesis, DHODH. F901318 potently inhibits fungal 
DHODH but is a very poor inhibitor of the human enzyme. This differential activity is consistent with the differences in structure between the human and fungal  DHODH enzymes.  
As discussed in the Nonclini cal Pharmacology sec tion of the IB, F901318 is active against a 
wide range of Aspergillus  species including those most commonly associated with human 
infection . Importantly, F901318 is effective against isolates of  A. fumigatus  resistant to other 
antifungal agents, Scedosporium  spp. and Lomentospora prolificans ; the latter is frequently  
refractory to all available antifungal  agent s. F901318 is also active against a range of other

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_1163349] yeasts, zygomycetes, and some Fusarium species. 
Within F901318’s spectrum of activity is an evolving panel of other “uncommon” moulds 
which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_837621]/or polyenes, including Rasamsonia  
species as well as Acremonium , Scopulariopsis , Microascus , and Paecilomyces  species . 
Treatment with F901318 may be of benefit in these IFDs, particularly in patients unable to 
tolerate alternative treatment options.  
Sustained exposure to F901318 is lethal to fungi. Vacuolation, cell wall thinning, and cell wall rupture are seen. Loss of cell membrane integrity can be shown by [CONTACT_837670].  
Nonclinical in vivo  studies, including pharmacological, toxicological and animal models of 
human invasive fungal infections, have shown F901318 has a good efficacy, safety  and 
tolerability  profile  with i n vitro  studies showing that it lacks phototoxicity potential. The 
CYP -based metabolic profile of F901318 and its weak CYP inhibition potential means that 
DDIs can be predicted and managed . F901318 is active by [CONTACT_837671].  Fungal burden can be reduced in lung and brain. 
Extensive n onclinical PK /pharmac
 odyna mic studies of IA (two in vivo  animal models, 
multiple strains and species of Aspergillus ) have defined sustained exposure with a C min of 0.1 
to 0.3 µg  /mL as the plasma concentration predicted to be effective in the treatment of invasive 
fungal infections in man. In addition,  in vivo  data from a Coccidioides immitis  brain 
m
odel showed improvements in animal survival and clearance of infected brain tis sue that 
could not be achieved with a control azole antifungal.  
2.1.3  Clinic
al pharmacology: Potentially e fficacious and well tolerated 
exposures can be achieved after oral and IV  dosing  
The safety profile of F901318 in humans has been characterized in 294 healt hy individua ls

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_1163350] shown that F901318 is a substrate for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, 
CYP3A4, C
YP2C9, and CYP2C8, with metabolism being more significant for CYPs 3A4 , 
2C9, and 2C8. F901318 is not an inducer of any CYP enzyme. In man, hepatic metabolism 
produces a single major metabolite, , that
 circulates at concentrations approximately 
40% of the con
centration of F901318. This metabolite has MICs for Aspergillus spp. that are 
16- to 32-fold higher than F901318 and hence is considered to contribute little or no 
mean ingful microbiological activity . 
The specif
ic combination of fluconazole (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitor) and F901318 has 
been studied in man and exposure to fluconazole has been shown to increase mean AUC 0-[ADDRESS_1163351] shown 
that F901318 is a weak  inhibitor of CYP3A4; in a  clinical stud y treatment with F901318 
resulte d in an approximate ly 1.6-fold elevation of midazolam exposure. F901318 also shows 
potential for inhibition of the P- gp, BCRP , and BSEP transporters in in vitro  studies, and 
whilst the potential for drug interactions is thought to be low, careful monitorin g may be 
needed for sensitive substrates of these transporters which have narrow therapeutic windows. 
Based on these findings, caution should be exercised when F901318 is dosed together with 
any CYP inducer (this may reduce F901318 levels) or inhibitor (this may increase F901318 
levels). In addition, F901318 could increase the exposures of compounds metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4.  
The Investigator is advised to consult with the MM on concomitant medications that either are 
metabolized by [CONTACT_837673]. Concomitant administration of inhibitors of human DHODH (teriflunomide and leflunomide) is prohibited. Co -dosing with 
moderate or strong CYP3A4 or 2C9 inhibitors will require a dose reduction for F901318 and

been conducted in healthy volunteers. The results of this study will provide insight into possible differences between the PK profiles of F901318 in healthy volunteers and in patients, and also on potential F901318 DDIs. 
This study will be performed in compliance with the protocol, International Co uncil  for 
Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and appl icable regulatory requirements.  
2.3 Hypothesis  
This is a  single -arm, open- label, Phase IIb  study. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
treatment with F901318 wil l generally be presented in a descri ptive manner. In addition, the 
response rates will be compared with  estimated historical  response rates  in the respective 
DRC -adjudicated disease  categories.  The PK profile of F901318 will be compared with  data 
from previous studies of F901318 in healthy volunteers. 
Invasive fungal infections due to resistant fungi cause substantial morbidity and mortality 
when either not treated or when available therapy lacks activity, especially in patients with 
reduced immune function:  
1. Invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients  is a devastating illness with a 
mortality that approaches 100% without effective therapy (Verweij  1994; Denning 1996; 
van der Linden 2011; D ixon 2015; Steinmann 2015). Timely treatment of IA with an 
effective modern drug may reduce mortality to approximately 20% at 6 week s (Herbrecht 
2002; Maertens 2016).

Investigator assessment of clinical efficacy, the dose regimen may be increased to 150 mg bid 
(with stepwise increases from 90 mg bid to 120 mg bid to 150 mg as discussed with the MM). There are no dietary rest rictions around the time of dosing, but timing of meals or enteral 
feedings prior to and during Intensive PK sampling and prior to scheduled or unscheduled 
trough sampling will be documented. 
Patient s will be treated until they reach a defined treatment endpoint. All patients should

in the main study  phase will be 90 days . Patient s judged to be a success on D ays 78 -83 (and 
hence requiring 85-90 days of total treatment) are eligible to receive up to 90 days of treatment  
in the main study  phase (90 days is the maximum duration of nonclinical safety toxicology 
studies) . In addition, at the Investigator’s request  and after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor (MM), open- label treatment with F901318 may be continued beyond Day 90 in 
patients who are considered likely to continue to benefit from ET. The Investigator’s request 
to extend treatment with F901318 must be approved by [CONTACT_303766]. In the case of patient s 
proceeding to the ET phase , the end of treatment ( EOT ) and end of study ( EOS ) are taken as

required, but will stop if the study drug becomes commercially available  or if development of 
the study drug is terminated for any reason . 
If, at any point during the study period, cultures yield F901318- resistant isolates, patient s may 
remain in the study in the presence of clinical improvement, otherwise they will be conside red 
as treatment failures , treatment with F901318 will be stopped, and  the patient will be 
withdrawn from the study. 
To assess efficacy and disease progression during treatment the diagnostic test used to enrol 
the patient will be repeated.  It is essential that the same test is used throughout the study, to 
provide a robust assessment of change.  
 
  
 
Assessment of efficacy at other study visits will be in accordance with local practice and as clinically indicated.  In patients with IA, GM testing will be conducted more frequently.

enrolment of patients in the categories which require a positive identification of the fungal 
pathogen. This should allow unrestricted enrolment of patients in these categories. The number of patients with unconfirmed infection (Probable LRTD  IA) will be monitored, and enrolment into 
this category may be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_1034].  This approach should facilitate the 
enrolment of patients with confirmed IFD and also limit the risk of inappropriate treatment in patients who do not have confirmed infection. 
This is a single -arm, open- label, Phase IIb  study.  There is no suitable alternative treatment for 
patients in this study, and inclusion of a comparator treatment arm would not be appropriate. In 
addition, it is unlikely that any single comp arator would be appropriate for all disease categories.  
In clinical PK studies, the terminal half -life of F901318 is 24 to 30 hours. The use of a loading 
dose regimen of 150 mg bid (given at 12 ± 1 h intervals) to initiate treatment will allow a 
therapeuti cally effective blood concentration to be achieved rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. The daily maintenance dose 
of 90 mg bid (given at 12 ± 1 h intervals) has been selected to provide sustained exposure to blood concentrations of F901318 predicted to be clinically effective. Howev er, should ongoing 
studies in healthy volunteers demonstrate that an alternative dosing regimen (up to three times 
daily dosing of a total daily dose of up to 300 mg)  provides blood levels that fall within the target

is the maximum duration of nonclinical safety toxicology studies) ; in addition, at the 
Investigator’s request and after discussion with the MM, open- label treatment with F901318 may 
be continued beyond Day 90 in patients who are considered by [CONTACT_837682]. The Investigator’s request to extend treatment with F901318 must 
be discussed with the MM and approved by [CONTACT_303766]. In the case of patients  proceeding to the ET 
phase, EOT and EOS for the main study phase are defined as the day therapy is completed  in the 
main study  phase at approximately Day 90 . 
Once enrolled, patients may remain in the study at the Investigator’s discretion  based on the site 
and severity of the IFD, the patient’s underlying di sease and  the rate of clinical response, even if 
subsequent laboratory data suggest an alternative therapy might be possible. For example, if an isolate of LoPro is found to have unexpectedly low azole MICs, the patient may remain in the study. 
For all pat ients  except those receiving  ET, the Follow-up Visit will take place 4 weeks (±7 d ays) 
after the last administration of study drug, and may occur before or after Day 42 and/or Day 84

[IP_ADDRESS] Inte
raction of F901318 with Concomitant Medication 
Medications with the potential for meaningful DDIs with F901318 are summarized in the IB and 
in this sec
tion. In brief, any agent that either inhibits CYP- mediated drug clearance (m ight reduce 
clearance of F901318) or that is cleared by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (levels might be increased by F901318) should be used with care.  
. All othe
r medications  with potential for DDIs 
should be approached on a case- by-case basis in consultation with the MM.  
In in vitro  st
udies, F901318 is a substrate for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
and CYP2C8, with metabolism being more significant for 3A4, 2C9, and 2C8. F901318 is not an 
inducer of any CYP enzyme. F901318 is a weak  inhibitor of CYP3A4 (clinical studies have 
shown an approximate 1.6-fold elevation of midazolam exposure). F901318 also shows potential 
for inhibition of the P- gp, BCRP , and BSEP  transporters in in vitro  studies, and whilst the 
potential for drug interactions is thought low, careful monitoring may be needed for sensitive substrates of these transporters which have narrow therapeutic windows . The specific 
combination of F901318 and fluconazole (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 inhibitor) has been studied in 
man and fluconazole has been shown to increase mean AUC
0-12 and C max of F901318 by 2.0 and 
1.7-fold, respectively. 
 
 In 
addition, F901318 c
ould increase the exposures of compounds metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. 
The Investigator is advised to consult with the MM on concomitant medications that either are 
metabolized by [CONTACT_837673],  
Specific data on other drug-drug combinations is being continuously developed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Co-Dosing with CYP Inhibitors  
Monitoring of circulating levels of F901318 is required when co-dosing with CYP inhibitors. 
As F901318 is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and CYP2C9 there is a potential for DDIs . Co-dosing

 F901318 with  Sensitive and Moderately Sensitive CYP3A4 
Substrates  
Monitoring of circulating levels of the concomitant medication is required when co-dosing 
F901318 with sensitive and moderately sensitive CYP3A4 s ubstrates . 
F901318 is a perpetrator of potential DDIs with CYP3A4 s ubstrates . As F901318 is a weak 
inhibitor of CYP3A4, co-dosing with sensitive and moderately sensitive CYP3A4 substrates may increase exposure of these substrates. Consultation with the MM and use of TDM for the substrate are advised if the combination cannot be avoided. 
For those concomitant medications which are sensitive and moderately sensitive CYP3A4 
substrates  and which undergo routine TDM (such as transplant drugs), changes in concomitant 
drug treatment and all TDM results for the concomitant medication will be recorded . If the 
patient is receiving the concomitant medication prior to receiving F901318, a baseline TDM sample should be sent for analysis prior to F901318 treatment commencing. Further TDM sampling should be performed on a schedule based on the Investigator’s judgment regarding the 
given medication.

[IP_ADDRESS] Candida Prophylaxis and Concomitant Antifungal Therapy 
F901318 is not active against yeast infections  and the use of fluconazole for prophylaxis or 
treatment of concomitant candidiasis is permitted at any time due to fluconazole’s lack of activity against  mould fungi. Patients who are receiving treatment with isavuconazole or posacon azole 
should be switch ed to rec eive treatment with fluconazole.  Should a patient start or stop receiving

Patients with a successful overall outcome at the main study  phase EOT that is prior to Day [ADDRESS_1163409] return for Day 42 and Day 84 Visits, even if they are no longer on study treatment. If 
administration of systemic antifungals as prophylaxis is anticipated following successful therapy 
patients should remain on study drug through Day 42. 
Patients with an unsuccessful overall outcome at the main study  phase EOT and requiring 
alternative systemic antifungal therapy will not be asked to return for Day 42 and/or Day 84 
Visits; however the survival status at these timepoints wil l be collected at a minimum 
(confirmation by [CONTACT_837689]). For patients 
who complete treatment during the main study  phase, a Follow- Up Visit will be performed [ADDRESS_1163410] dose of study drug.  
For patients who receive ET, subsequent visits in the ET phase will be every 4 weeks to assess the safety of continued treatment and to assess the need for further treatment, and there will be a 
FU visit 4 weeks after ET is completed .  
6.3.1 Investigator’s Assessment of Overall Response 
Diagnostic assessments  used to support the I nvestigators assessment of response  include 
mycological culture, histology/cytology, GM, PCR, other mycology assessments, bronchoscopy and radiology tests used to co nfirm enrolment of the patient. It is essential, where possible, that 
the same methods are used for both diagnosis and assessment of overall response. Any additional 
assessments performed during the course of the study to assess the patients status may also be 
used to support efficacy response assessments.

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment 06 final 28Feb2020  Confidential  The Investi gator’s assessment of response will be recorded at Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Day 42, 
Day 84/EOT main study phase and 4 weeks after EOT in the main study phase. The Investi gator 
will provide his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_217054]’s response, based  on the efficacy criteria as described 
in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] (clinical), Section  [IP_ADDRESS] (radiological), Section [IP_ADDRESS] (bronchoscopic), 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] (mycological) and Section [IP_ADDRESS] (overall response). 
For patients who receive ET with F901318, the Investi gator’s assessment of overall response will 
be recorded at  each visit to support continued treatment.  
If multiple fun gal mould pathogens are present, the DRC will separately analyse outcome for 
each relevant pathogen. Pathogens which were known at baseline to be F901318- resistant and for 
which alternative concomitant therapy was provided are not separately scored by [CONTACT_16009]. For 
example, a patient treated with F901318 and isavuconazole for simultaneous azole- resistant 
aspergillosis and mucormycosis would receive an overall score only for the response of the 
aspergillosis. As appropriate, the Investigator may provide per-fungus comments on the clinical, 
radiological, and mycological elements but per-fungus scores for each of these sub- elements are 
not required. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Response  
Clinical response will be based on clinical signs, physical findings , and symptom s relevant to 
each patient.  The Investigator will be responsible for identifying and assessing clinical signs, 
physical findings , and symptoms related to the IFD reported for each patient. Assessment of 
clinical response will be based on changes from baselin e signs , findings, and symptoms. Clinical 
signs, physical findings , and symptoms will be assessed  
 
 as 
shown i
n Tab
le 1. A
ssessment at Day 42 and at Day 84 is required for all patients, including 
those who completed treatment before these visits.   
For patients who receive ET with F901318, the Investi gator’s assessment of clinical response will 
be recorded at  each visit to support continued treatment.  
Baseline symptoms may need to include symptoms pr esent at the time of the initial diagnosis of 
the qualifying infection. This situation may arise  when a patient  has had a prior therapy, 
responded to that therapy, but then developed intolerance to the therapy and is hence started on 
F901318 therapy without active symptoms at the point of study enrolment. Such prior symptoms will be recorded in the appropriate sect ion of the eCRF. 
The results of assessments of clinical signs , physical findings, and symptoms (including those 
performed outside of these mandatory scheduled timepoint s) will be recorded in the eCRF.

[IP_ADDRESS] Radiological Response 
As relevant for the IFD under study, baseline radiological assessments of IFD should be 
performe
d during the screening period and during the course of the study. T he assessment of the 
patient’s radiological response related to IFD will be recorded at  
 as clin
ically 
indicated . 
Note that r adiological response assessments can be made using all available radiology 
since the last response assessment visit or w ithin the visit window of the visit in question. 
Radiolog
ical assessments of IFD should be made in accordance with local practice and as 
clinically indicated . The same methodology should be used for each radiological assessment 
performed for a patient  throughout the study. All radiological images taken up to Day 84/Day [ADDRESS_1163411]- ET FU should not be sent for 
independent review. Further details will be provided in a Central Reading Laboratory Manual, including instructions for recording and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_837628]. 
The results of all IFD -related radiology performed during the study will be recorded in the eCRF 
and the reports will be collected.

response assessment visit.  
(Note that for patients planning to receive ET  beyond Day 90, the Day 84 visit and the main 
study phase EOT visit will be combined into a single Day 84/ EOS/ EOT visit on approximately 
Day 90). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bronchoscopic Assessment  
Bronchoscopy should be performed as clinically indicated, in accordance with local practice, and 
samples should be obtained for culture and histology/cytology testing during the same procedure. If bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) samples are taken f or local GM and PCR testing, additional 
aliquots must be obtained for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_837629]. This applies for all respi[INVESTIGATOR_837630] 84/Day [ADDRESS_1163412]- ET visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mycological Assessments and Responses 
Mycological criteria to be used for enrolment of patients are described in Appendix 2
. 
Mycological assessments include culture, histology/ cytology, GM  (in the case of IA), PCR, and 
other mycology assessments depending on the IFD under study. Mycological assessments will be 
performed according to local practice using local laboratories  and central laboratories up to the 
Day 84/Day [ADDRESS_1163413]- ET visit.  
Samples to be assessed include those suitable for fungal culture and isolation and/or biopsy or 
biological fluid samples from the infected site for histology/cytology , GM, and PCR. For each 
sample obtained, an additional sample must be collected for shipment to the appropriate central 
laboratory.  
If available, baseline pat hogen isolates, tissues, or biological fluid samples associated with the 
IFD will be stored and shipped to the appropriate central laboratory for confirmation of infection, 
identification of the fungal species, and susceptibility testing. Any available pre- study (baseline) 
isolates, tissues, or biological fluid samples should be shipped regardless of date of collection 
relative to study initiation. If infection is due to multiple fungi, relevant isolates, tissues, or

isolates do not need to be shipped. 
*If it is not possible to send isolates, tissues, or biological fluid samples to confirm the EORTC 
classification, where available, relevant digital images should  be submitted to the appropriate 
central laboratory for review. If there are no isolates, samples or images available for shipment to 
the central laboratory, local laboratory reports confirming the EORTC criteria will be used to support the EORTC classification. Local laboratory report details documenting the EORTC 
classification for ALL patients should be submitted to the eCRF. 
If the identities of the pathogens differ between the central and local laboratories, the central 
laboratory results will take pre cedence over the local results for all study purposes.  
Guidelines for collection, culture and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_837631] (for GM and PCR) will be provided in the Central Laboratory Manual.  
The results of all mycological asse ssments performed during the study will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
Culture : Isolates obtained by [CONTACT_837690].  Please refer to 
the laboratory manual for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_837632]. Considerations for culture include: 
• Suitable samples for fungal culture and isolation (blood/CSF/tissue cultures). 
• Follow-up culture samples from non-bloodstream infections, if obtained, results should be recorded.  
• For outcome assessment of fungal blood stream infections, confirmed (two consecutive) 
negative blood cultures are required. 
• All isolates should be identified to species level.  
• Biopsy/biological fluid samples from the infected site for histology and cytology.  
• If patient has LRTD and is able to produce sputum, samples should be sent for culture and 
histology / cytology.  
All baseline and main study  phase EOT isolates will be stored and shipped for central retesting. 
Due to  the nature of the relevant  infections, baseline isolates may include cultures collected 
weeks or months before enrolment. The central laboratory results will be considered definitive. 
Galactomannan Antigen : Galactomannan  (GM) is a cell wall polysaccharide component of 
Aspergillus  species that can be detected in serum samples using an immune- enzymatic sandwich 
micro -plate assay (Platelia™ Bio -Rad assay), with results expressed as an optical density index.

assessed as a positive result for P robable LRTD  IA. Culture and histology must be obtained from 
the same sample and serum GM must  be obtained in accordance with the protocol . Plasma -
LyteTM (Baxter) may not be used as the lavage fluid.  
Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay: The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) assay is widely used 
as a diagnostic tool in clinical laboratories as an aid in the diagnosis of IFD. When diagnosis of 
the pre-study fungal infection is based on or supported by [CONTACT_837691], additional samples must also be provided for PCR testing by [CONTACT_837692].  
CSF Findings for Coccidioidomycosis Patients:

The Investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the mycological response for each 
patient at Day 7, Day 42, Day 84/EOT and 4 weeks after EOT in the main study phase and at other visits as clinically indicated  (note that for patients planning to receive ET  beyond Day 90, 
the Day 84 visit and the main study phase EOT visit will be combined into a single Day 84/EOS /EOT visit on approximately Day 90. ). Outside of these timepoints, mycological 
assessment will be performed as clinically indicated and/or in line with standard clinical 
management for the patient’s specific IFD and anatomic site involved.  
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the mycological response as follows: 
• Eradication  (eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by 
[CONTACT_27183]/cytology at baseline  and no emergence of new  causative organisms at that visit). 
• Presumed eradication  (missing documentation of the eradication of the original causative 
organism cultured or identified by [CONTACT_27183]/cytology at baseline and no documentation of emergence of new causative organisms at that visit  plus resolution of all or some attributable 
clinical symptoms and physical findings of IFD present at baseline and/or of those that 
appeared at a subsequent visit and no appearance of new attributable clinical symptoms and 
physical findings of IFD at that visit). 
• Persistence (persistence of the original causative organism cultured or identified by 
[CONTACT_27183]/cytology at baseline or emergenc e of a new causative organism  at that visit). 
• Presumed persistence (missing documentation of the persistence of the original causative organism cultured or identified by [CONTACT_27183]/cytology at baseline and no documentation of emergence of new causative organisms at that visit plus either (i) no resolution or (ii) 
worsening of any attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings of IFD present at 
baseline and/or of those that appeared at a subsequent visit and/or appearance of new 
attributable clinical signs and physical findings of IFD at that visit). 
• No mycological Follow -up results available , for whatever reason (no diagnos tic test done at 
the scheduled  timepoint AND other data are insufficient to support assigning Presumed 
Eradication or Presumed Persistence). 
• No mycological evidence at baseline  (negative diagnostic test(s) results at baseline, or not 
done at baseline). 
Mycological Response after Initial Success  
If relevant mycology findings occur after successful mycological response (proven or presumed eradication), an evaluation will be made as to whether the infection is recurrent (same species as at baseline) or emergent (different species compared with baseline). Patients with recurrent or

cultures were reported.  
Recurrent – Re- appearance of same species after apparent negative culture PLUS additional 
antifungal treatment becomes necessary . 
Emergent  – Appearance of new species after appar ent negative culture PLUS additional 
antifungal treatment becomes necessary . New species emerging during the first [ADDRESS_1163417] been present at baseline and are classified as Baseline 
secondary  infections rather than Emergent infections . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigator’s Assessment of Overall Response 
The Investi gator’s assessment of overall response will be based on all available assessments  
(clinical,  radiological and mycological)  as des cribed in Section s [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS] and  [IP_ADDRESS]. It is 
essential that the same methods and assessments are used to define the IFD diagnosis at baseline 
and to evaluate the response to treatment.  
Treatment “success”  is defined as complete or partial . 
Treatment “failure”  is defined as stable response or progression  of IFD.   
Of the three components of overall response, only clinical and mycological responses are required. Patients who lack data at a visit (e.g., the visit data were not collected  for some reason) 
or who are not evaluable at the visit because these data cannot be collected are considered failures . 
The criteria for assessment of overall response are summarised in Table 5:

• Mycological: Meets criteria for p resumed or documented eradication.  
Success -
partial *: • Clinical: Meets criteria for Resolution- Complete or Resolution -Partial; 
        AND  
• Radiological (if assessed) : Shows resolution or improvement of radiological 
abnormalities (at least 25% response);  
        AND  
• Mycological: Meets criteria for p resumed or documented eradication. 
Failure -

symptoms and physical findings previously noted and no new attributable clinical 
symptoms or physical findings of IFD (Failure- Stable) ; 
        OR  
• Radiological: Shows  no evidence of progression OR < 25% improvement of 
radiological abnormalities ; 
        OR  
• Mycological: Had mycological evidence at baseline AND does not meet criteria for presumed or documented eradication. 
Failure -
progression:  • Clinical: Either worsening of attributable clinical symptoms or physical findings 
of IFD or appearance of new attributable symptoms or findings of IFD (Failure-
Progression); 
        OR  
• Radiological: Worsening or new radiological  abnormalities;  
        OR  
• Mycological: Has mycological evidence for a recurrent or emergent IFD, OR alternative systemic antifungal treatment required.
 
*For these categories, the only required data are the clinical and mycological  data. The absence 
of radiological evaluations at a given time point does not prevent assignment to Success-
Complete or Succes s-Partial. The rules defining success are tested in sequence with Success -
Complete assigned if its rules are met and Success -Partial otherwise assigned . 
6.3.2 Survival 
All-cause mortality has been used historically as an endpoint in other similar clinical studies in 
IFD. All-cause mortality will be assessed using survival status and, if applicable, death details 
will be recorded in the eCRF.  If the patient has died, the date and cause of death will be recorded, 
in addition to details required for SAE reporting (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Survival status will be recorded at Day 42, main study  phase EOT, Day 84 and at the 4- week FU  
and included in the CSR. Information on survival status on Days 42 and 84 will be collected in all

receive ET  beyond Day 90, the Day 84 visit and the main study phase EOT visit will be combined 
into a single Day 84/ EOS/ EOT visit on approximately Day 90) .  
Survival status will also be recorded at each ET visit and at the post-ET FU visit, and will be present ed in the report addendum. 
6.3.3 Data Review Committee Assessment of Overall Response 
Independent assessment of overall response during the main study  phase wi ll be performed by [CONTACT_837693] 84/Day 90, and for the post -treatment FU visit for patients who do not 
receive ET . The DRC will not assess overall response at any ET visits or at the post- ET FU. 
Details of the process and overall response definitions will be documented in the DRC charter.  
6.3.4  Patient -Reported Outcome s 
Patient -reported outcomes will be assessed in this study using the EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire. The 
EQ-5D- 5L questionnaire will be completed  by [CONTACT_837694] a baseline, 
at the Day 42  and Day 84/EOT main study phase visits , and every 4 weeks during the ET phase. 
The questionnaire, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by [CONTACT_837695]. To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet 
health authority requirements, the questionnaire should be self -administered and checked for 
completion at the site staff prior to the completion of other study assessments. 
6.4 Safety  
The Investi gator will evaluate safety by [CONTACT_320113], physical examination, vital signs, 
laboratory tests, ECG, imaging and concomitant medication/surgery, as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 and Table 3). 
6.4.1 Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs observed during the study period ( main 
study phase and ET phase) including 4- week post- treatment follow-up. 
Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a preexisting condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency ). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of study treatment. L ack of efficacy or insufficient clinical response should not be recorded as an 
AE.

Protocol Number: F901318 /0032  
Drug Name: F901318  
F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment 06 final 28Feb2020  Confidential  Events which meet the definition of an AE include: 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vit al signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermitten t pre-existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should 
be reported regardless of sequelae. 
Events which do not  meet the definition of an AE include: 
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_837696] ’s condition. Changes in laboratory findings that 
fulfil the definition of an AESI must ALWAYS be reported as an AESI (AND as an SAE 
if any seriousness criteria are also met) . 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the patient ’s condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day- to-day fl uctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
Definition o f a Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to study drug or 
not) that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
Sponsor Name: F2G   87 
Protocol Number: F901318 /0032  
Drug Name: F901318  
F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment 06 final 28Feb2020  Confidential  • Is life -threatening (the patient is at a risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128895]/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered 
AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient  was enrolled in the study, provided that 
it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  
• Other: Medically significant events, which do not meet any of the criteria above, but may 
jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are blood 
dyscrasias ( e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion) or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as any  noxious and/or unintended response to a 
medicinal product related to any dose. 
An u nexpected ADR  is defined as any adverse reaction, the nature of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information. The Reference Safety Information Section  of the IB identifies 
expected ADRs.   Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness and causal relationship to the 
investigational drug . The act ion taken and the outcome must also be recorded. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI  is defined as a serious or non- serious event of scientific and medical concern specific to 
the investigational product, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_837697].  
All AESIs will be recorded on th e Adverse Event form in the eCRF, and in source documents. 
Any AESI which occurs during this study, whether or not related to the study drug, must be 
recorded in the electronic data capture (eDC) system within [ADDRESS_1163418] the AESI on the paper AESI reporting form and submit within 
24 hours as described above. 
As soon as it is possible to do so, any AESI reported via paper mus t be transcribed into the eCRF 
database according to instructions in the eCRF completion guidelines.

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment 06 final 28Feb2020  Confidential  Relationship  
The causal relationship between the study drug and the AE has to be characterized as unrelated, 
unlikely, possible, probable or unknown (unable to judge).  
Events can be classified as “unrelated” if there is not a reasonable possibility that the study drug 
caused the AE.  
An “unlikely” relationship suggests that only a remote connection exists between the study drug 
and the reported AE. Other conditions, including chronic illness, progression or expression of the 
disease state or reaction to concomitant medi cation, appear to explain the reported AE. 
A “possible” relationship suggests that the association of the AE with the study drug is uncertain ; 
however, the AE is not reasonably supported by [CONTACT_145037]. 
A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with drug 
administration exists and, in the Investigator ’s clinical judgment, it is likely that a causal 
relationship exists between the drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent 
illness, progression or expression of disease state or concomitant medication reactions) do not 
appear to explain the AE.  
All efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories . The category 
“unknown” (unable to judge) may be used only if the causality is not assessable, e.g. , because of 
insufficient evidence, conflicting evidence, conflicting data, or poor documentation. 
All AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported in the eCRF. If possible, a 
diagnosis should be documented rather than a list of individual signs and symptoms. All AEs 
should be recorded in English. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs  which occur after the patient has provided informed consent, regardless of severity and 
whether or not they occurred during stud y enrolment, treatment or follow -up, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate AE pages (either ‘serious’ or ‘non-serious’) in the eCRF . The Investigator 
should complete all the details requested including dates of onset, severity, action taken , outcome 
and relationship to study drug. Each event should be recorded separately.  
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria. If the AE is  
considered serious, the Investigator should record this event in the eDC  system within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the event. This entry into the eDC system will automatically trigger an e -
mail alert to the Sponsor and to the MM. 
An event may qualify for expedited reporting to regulatory authorities if it is an SAE, unexpected 
per reference safety information and considered related (Suspected  Unexpected  Serious Adverse 
Reaction  [S[LOCATION_003]R ]) in line with relevant legislation. All Investigators will receive a safety letter

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_1163419] be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study centre’s  
knowledge of the event) in the eCRF. The report will contain as much available information 
concerning the SAE to enable the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) to file a report, which 
satisfies regulatory reporting requirements.  
If for any reason it is not possible to record the SAE information electronically, i.e., the eCRF 
database is not functioning, record the SAE on the paper SAE  reporting form and submit within 
24 hours as described above. 
— As soon as it is possible to do so, any SAE reported via paper must be transcribed into the 
eCRF database according to instructions in the eCRF completion guidelines. 
— If an SAE has been reported via a paper form because the eCRF database has been locked,  no 
further action is necessary.  
Paper CRF reports are to be submitted  by [CONTACT_837698] (or an authorized 
representat ive). Contact [CONTACT_837699], including telephone number, fax number, and an e- mail address.  
In addition to the initial 24 -hour report, additional information is required to be added to t he 
eCRF or a paper report  sent to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) via fax or mail 
within 48 hours of the event. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs and to all follow -up 
reports . 
All SAEs will be recorded on the SAE Report form, the Adverse Events form in the eCRF , and 
source documents. Criteria for documenting the relationship to study drug as well as severity and 
outcome will be the same as those previously described.  
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within 30 days of a patient 's last visit ( EOS  visit) are to 
be collected and rep orted as previously described. 
The information must include the following as a minimum: 
• Name, address and telephone number of the repor ting Investigator. 
• Investigational product and study code. 
• Patient  identification number, initials, sex and date of birth. 
• Description of the AE , measures taken and outcome.

In the case of fatal or life -threatening events , the Investigator should immediately telephone the 
Sponsor’s Safety Surveillance and Reporting Unit  (or an authorized representative). C ontact 
details will be provided to the site. Additional follow-up information should be com pleted on an 
SAE follow-up form with a copy sent to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and the 
original placed in the SAE section of the eCRF  binder. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and Investigators 
Investigator s will be notified by [CONTACT_1034] (or an authorized representative) of all SAE s that 
require prompt submission to their Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee ( IEC). Investigator s should provide written documentation of IRB /IEC  notification 
for each report to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative). The Sponsor (or authorized 
representative) will ensure that all SAEs are reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities within the required timelines . 
Any hepatic AESI which meets biochemical Hy’s Law criteria (i.e. ALT/AST > 3x ULN and 
total bilirubin > 2x ULN) or has transaminase elevations which meet CTCAE criteria grade 4 (i.e. 
ALT/AST> [ADDRESS_1163420]), must be reported as a medically signficant SAE, regardless of causality. 
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_327471] a study 
treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencie s about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB)/IEC, and Investigators. 
• Investigator safety reports m ust be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary. 
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (eg, sum mary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review 
and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements. 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction is known as a S[LOCATION_003]R. The S[LOCATION_003]R, SAEs and other cases required by [CONTACT_837700] S ponsor’s representative to all concerned parties within the prescribed timeframe. The

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment 06 final 28Feb2020  Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Follow-u p of Adverse Events  
Any AEs observed from the date of informed consent up to the EOS  will be followed up to 
resolution. Resolution means that the patient  has returned to a baseline state of health or the 
Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. All AE s that occur 
after the patient  completed a clinical study (within [ADDRESS_1163421] dose of study drug) should 
also be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative). 
For hepatic AESIs, even though the AE may appear to have resolved, a longer follow-up may be 
requested by [CONTACT_837701], in which case results of additional blood samples (analysed in a local 
laboratory for liver biochemistry) and other relvant clinical data will be collected and provided to the HAC for review.  
For patients receiving ET , all AEs will be followed up to resolution. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Documenting Pregnancy During Study  
Patient s who are pregnant or expect to become pregnant during the course of the study will be 
excluded from participation in the study. Should a patient  become pregnant after enrolling in the 
study, the Investigator will report this event to F2G or its designee w ithin 24 hours and to the 
IRB/EC. No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity associated with F901318 treatment has been detected in the rat or rabbit. Nonetheless, as a new molecular entity, F901318 should not be given to pregnant women unless the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. The Investigator should consult 
with the MM to review any available new or supplemental information. The Investigator should 
then counsel the patient and discuss risks of continuing or discontinuing therapy with F901318, risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the foetus. Sites must request 
the patient ’s permission to query pregnancy outcome and follow each patient to determine the 
outcome of the pregnancy.  
Results will be summarized in  the CSR. 
Patient s who become pregnant at any point during the study (including during ET) should 
continue to be followed for safety assessments whether or not the patient is  receiving further 
study t reatments. Procedures that are contraindicated during pregnancy must not be performed. 
Investigators should use clinical judgment regarding subsequent study-related blood collection 
based on the presence or absence of an aemia in each patient . Patient s who are not withdrawn 
from the study should continue to be followed for safety assessments to study discharge per 
protocol. 
All pregnancies that occur from the time of the first screeni ng procedure through the follow-up 
visits must be reported. Monitoring of the patient  and the outcome of the pregnancy should be 
followed by [CONTACT_737]. If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been 
completed, the outcome should be reported directly to F2G.

outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient  exposed to Study Treatment. The 
pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow-up on her pregnancy. Once the authorization has been signed, the 
Investigator will update the Pregnancy Form with additional information on the course and 
outcome of the pregnancy. 
An Investigator who is contact[CONTACT_837702], to support an 
informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician. 
The Investi gator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the f oetus, as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor. When the outcome of the pregnancy falls under the criteria for SAEs [spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomaly (including anomaly in a 
miscarried  foetus)], the Investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure for 
SAEs. Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy (which is categorized as an 
SAE) is outlined below: 
• 
“Spontaneous abortion" includes abortion and missed abortion 
• Death of infant within 1 month after birth regardless of its relationship with study drug 
• If infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study drug is judged as " possible " by 
[CONTACT_11856] 
• In case of a delivery of a living newborn, the "normality" of the infant is evaluated at birth 
• "Normality" of the miscarried f oetus is evaluated by [CONTACT_837703] a congenital anomaly are obtained prior to miscarriage . 
Progression of Disease under Study  
Progression of disease under study (i.e. the qualifying fungal infection) will not constitute an AE. 
However, if the progression of disease leads to a serious outcome, such as death, this will be reportable within the same timeframe using the same format as for an SAE.

[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenic Status  
Neutropenic status relating to the study-qualifying infection should be recorded, regardless of the 
time prior to study drug administration.  Neutropenic status will be recorded for all patients for the 
period within [ADDRESS_1163425] Factor criteria of “Neutropenia” related to the study -qualifying infection should be 
recorded, regardless of the time prior to study drug administration. Neutropenic status will be 
recorded throughout the main study  phase and 4- week FU, an d throughout the ET phase and 
post-ET FU for those patients who receive ET. 
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) will be used to determine neutropenic status, with neutropenia 
defined as ANC < 0.5 × 109/L [< 500/mm3]. The presence or absence of neutropenia and 
subsequent persistence or resolution (resolution defined as consecutive ANC values > 0.5 × 109/L 
on two separate days) will be determined from the ANC values recorded in the eCRF.  
All ANC values obtained (or calculated) at local laboratories during a neutropenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_837633]. When differentials cannot be

According to the Guidelines of GCP  (CPMP/ICH/135/95), the Sponsor is responsible for 
implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems with written 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). For this study, many of these responsibilitie s are 
delegated to a CRO, . 
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling. 
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data:  
• Investigator meetings  
• Central laboratories fo r analysis of clinical laboratory parameters  and plasma levels of 
F901318  
• Central reading of radiological images  
• Independent review of safety data by [CONTACT_837710]  
• Independent adjudication of eligibility and response data by a DRC 
• Centre Initiation visit  
• Early centre visits post-enrolment 
• Routine centre monitoring 
• Ongoing centre communication and training 
• Data management quality control checks  
• Continuous data acquisition and cleaning 
• Internal review of data  
• Quality control check of the final CSR. 
Protocol deviations will be identified as soon as possible by [CONTACT_779], the on- site clinical monitor, 
the MM and the data management team.  While every effort should be made to avoid protocol 
deviations, should a deviation be discovered, Sponsor must be informed. Any protocol deviation impacting Patient  safety must be reported to the MM immediately  and to the Sponsor. 
The Investigator should not implement any deviation from or changes to the protocol without 
approval by [CONTACT_360822]/favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_77238] a protocol amendment, except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to study

the patient s participating in the study. Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as 
possible during or after the patient ’s visit . To avoid inter-observer variability, every effort should 
be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations 
completes all efficacy and safety evaluations . The Investigator must verify that all data entries in 
the eCRFs are accurate and correct . If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is 
not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigato r should indicate this in the eCRF. The 
Investigator will be required to electronically sign off on the clinical data . 
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency . The 
eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections and alterations are to be made by [CONTACT_242717]/her designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once clinical data 
of the eC RF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the data fields will be audit 
trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_27501], together with time and date will be logged . Roles and rights of the study centre  staff  responsible 
for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in advance . If additional 
corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data Manager will raise a query in the e DC 
application . The appropriate study centre st aff will answer queries sent to the Investigator. This

the patient , the inclusion and exc lusion criteria and all records covering the patient ’s participation 
in the study. They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing 
records, patient  files, etc.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These will be made available

This is a  single -arm open- label, Phase IIb  study, and there is no requirement for the Biostatistics 
Team respons ible for the final analysis to  be blinded to treatment allocation, nor for a  separate, 
independent Biostatistics Team to provide data on an ongoing basis for IDSMB review. 
Data collected  in the main study phase up to Day 84/Day 90 and the subsequent 4- week FU visit 
will be included in the data analyses and presented in the CSR. Data collected during ET will not 
be included in the data analyses for the CSR, and will be presented in the report addendum. 
8.1 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a single -arm, open- label, Phase IIb  study, with no randomization. Four proven invasive 
fungal infection enrolment categories (disease categories) are defined and there is no upper limit 
to the enrolment of patients within each culture-proven category.

8.2.1 General Considerations  
Full details of all analyses and data presentations to be performed will be documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . Further, the SAP will include details of the initial analysis and 
final analysis which will compare the data from this study to the external control data. 
Analyses will generally be descriptive in nature with data presented overall and by [CONTACT_715025] -
adjudicated disease category using appropriate summary statistics. Categorical data will be 
described using absolute and relative frequencies (n and %). Continuous data will be presented using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum).  
Summary statistics will be presented for observed data only. If a Baseline value is missing, no change from Baseline will be calculated. Missing data will be presented as part of a “Missing” category or statistic, if relevant.  
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing (scheduled or unscheduled) assessment up to and including Day [ADDRESS_1163435] assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) assigned to treatment, 
The EOS in the main study for each patient is defined as the last assessment (scheduled or 
unscheduled) assigned to the study which that patient completes. For patients receiving ET with F901318, EOS and EOT will be the same visit and will occur at approximately Day 90 . 
Relevant raw and derived variables will be listed in individual by- patient  data listings, sorted by 
[CONTACT_715025] -adjudicated disease category , region, centre and patient  number.  
Data on key endpoints may be summarised separately for the group requiring ET and those who 
do not require ET. Detail of these presentations will be provided in the SAP. 
A sub -group for consideration will be patients receiving extended treatment beyond Day 90. 
Details on sub-group analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
All analyses and data presentation will be performed using SAS

Exploratory Objective has been 
added: To describe the efficacy and 
safety of prolonged treatment with F901318 for infections due to 
resistant fungi in patients lacking 
suitable alternative treatment 
options. It is estimated that approximately 
25% of patients who respond to 
treatment with F901318 may require 
treatment beyond the maximum of 90 days of treatment included in the 
main phase of this protocol. Safety 
and efficacy data collected from the 
end of the main study phase onwards 
will be evaluated as an exploratory 
objective.

Section 4.3.1 Inclusion C riteria  In General Inclusion Criterion 6, ‘ If 
the isolate is subsequently found to 
be resistant, study therapy may be continued or  discontinued based 
on clinical response at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Patients with infections due to 
multiple fungi can be enrolled provided at least one fung us is

patient has limited alternative treatment options for that fungus as defined in Inclusion C riterion 
7. As a specific example, a patient with simultaneous IA due to an 
azole- resistant strain and also 
invasive mucormycosis could be 
enrolled and treated with the 
combination of F901318 and 
isavuconazole. The choice of 
additional agents to treat other 
fungi should also consider the 
limitations applied to allowed 
medications. Cases of polyfungal infection  should be discussed with

treatment of patients with resistant 
isolates has been added to allow continued treatment of patients if the 
Investigator is confident a clinical 
benefit is achieved.

conc omitant medications that 
prolong the QT/QTc interval . Nonclinical studies of F901318 have demonstrated minimal potential to 
affect the QT/QTc interval, and this 
has been confirmed in clini cal studies 
showing a lack of effect on QT/QTc interval across the t herapeutic 
exposure range .

There are currently no other 
absolutely prohibited 
concomitant medications but 
there are medications with 
potentially significant DDIs and 
the management of potential interactions should be considered 
before study enrolment . The additional text identifies the 
prohibited concomitant medica tions, 
and provides context for consideration of other concomitant medications.
 Even though nonclinical 
biochemical testing predicts a lack of cross -over effects between human and 
fungual DHODH, concomitant therapy with inhibitors of the human 
DHODH enzyme  has been prohibited 
as a precautionary measure.

Concomitant administration of 
teriflunomide and leflunomide is 
prohibited. There are no other 
absolutely prohibited or 
contraindicated medications. 
However, there are potential DDIs with F901318 and the 
choice of concomitant 
medications should take this i nto 
consideration  and  
Data to date suggest that F901318 does not prolong the QTc 
interval, and concomitant agents 
with known potential to prolong 
the QTc interval may be used 
with caution. Ongoing therapy with an agent known to have a 
risk of QT prolongat ion is not a 
contraindication for enrolment provided the patient meets the 
requirements of E xclusion 
Criterion 12. After enrolment, 
initiation of new concomitant treatment with known QTc -
prolonging agents must be discussed with and approved by

detailed guidance on the use of 
concomitant medication, and the rationale for this guidance. The 
guidance relates to specific

efficacy of F901318, it is important to avoid concomitant 
use of other systemic antifungal 
agents with known or potent ial 
activity against the primary fungal infection. The constraints on the choice of additional agents 
may be complex and thus use of 
any other systemic concomitant 
antifungal or combination 
treatment (such as addition of terbinafine for confirmed

F2G_Study 32_Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_1163482] not been summarized  
 
Amendment 01: 24 January 2018 
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. 
Overall Rationale for Amendment  01 
Analysis of pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers supports the use of a 
twice daily dosage regimen of F901318 to provide exposure within the predicted therapeutic 
range. The frequency of dosing has been changed from 4 times daily to 2 times daily based on 
these pharmacokinetic data. The frequency of blood sample collection when Intensive PK is being assessed has been amended to be consistent with the change in dose frequency.

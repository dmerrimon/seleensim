1.4 Research  Hypothesis  
Sequential administration of eribulin followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen ( 5-Fluorouracil , 
Adriamycin or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], and Cyclophosphamide ), has greater activity based  on pCR rate 
relative to sequential administration of Paclitaxel  followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen as primary 
systemic therapy for women with early stage breast cancer.  
A biomarker -defined population can be identified in which a higher pCR rate is observed in 
subjects treated with eribulin followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen compared with paclitaxel followed 
by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen.  
  
[ADDRESS_927833] common cause of death 
in women (after lung cancer), and is the main cause of death in women betwe en the ages of 45 
and 55. [2]  However, over the last decade the mortality rate has declined in the  [LOCATION_002] 
and [LOCATION_008] largely because of widespread use of mammography, breast c ancer 
screening programs, advances in evaluation technique, and more effective adjuvant 
treatments. [3] 
Studies that compared preoperat ive (neoadjuvant or primary systemic therapy) and adjuv ant 
chemotherapy in patients with early stage breast cancer have shown no difference in overall 
survival or disease free survival. [4] Primary systemic therapy (PST) is increasingly being used 
in the management of patients with early breast  cancer. Neoadjuvant  chemotherapy allows for 
monitoring of response to chemotherapy and enhances chances of breast conservation surgery 
and/or a better cosmetic outcome following mastectomy in patients with locally advanced breast 
cancer. [5, 6] Additionally, the neoadjuvant setting is ideal for pharmacogenomic studies to 
identify bre ast cancer patients likely to respond best to therapy. The provision of a surgical 
specimen, at the end of therapy, allows for a more rapid assessment of response (pathological 
responses) than adjuvant trials. Pathological complete response (pCR) is widely  accepted as a 
valuable prognostic indicator of long -term outcome after neoadjuvant therapy. [7] 
2.2.  Primary Systemic Therapy: Historical Perspective  
The rationale for considering the evaluation of primary systemic ther apy (PST) in patients with 
operable breast cancer began to evolve as clinical observations demonstrated the utility of this 
approach in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), [8-10]  and inflammatory 
breast cancer (IBC). In addition, preclinical observat ions, [11, 12] and mathematical models of 
tumor growth, dissemination, a nd development of resistance to chemotherapy support the use of 
PST rather than adjuvant therapy. These could lead to achieve longer disease -free survival (DFS) 
and overall survival (OS), presumably through early treatment of systemic micromestatatic 
disea se.  Since its initial use in the early 1970s, PST has become the standard of care for 
management of LABC and IBC, and increasingly been used for treatment of large operable and 
more recently for early -stage breast cancer.  
Chemo -, hormone -, and recently t rastuzumab -base therapy are potential PST options for the 
different sub -types of breast cancer in 2011.  PST provides several advantages, including down -
staging allowing surgery for non -operable breast cancer, and increasing breast -conservative 
surgery rat e in patients with large operable breast cancer.  It also provides an early surrogate 
factor, pCR, for long -term outcome and in -vivo model to assess clinical benefit and finally a 
research tool for understanding breast cancer biology and treatment mechanis ms of action(s) . 
 
[ADDRESS_927834] cancer other than 
directly measuring survival (DFS, and OS), which requires a large number of patients and long 
term follow -up. These e ndpoints included clinical response, radiologic response, rate of breast 
conservative surgery (BCS), and pathologic response. The results of several studies have been 
shown that pCR is predictive of long -term survival. [13-16]At present, the achievement of pCR 
has emerged as the primary end point of most interest in the clinical research literature. 
Attainment of pCR is associated with a favorable prognosis;  such patients have a far lower risk 
of subsequent recurre nce than do patients with residual invasive tumor at the time of surgery, and 
also seem to have improved overall survival. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_684773], there is no consensus on the measurement of this important en dpoint. 
Clinical and pathological responses are both frequently used as objective measurements of 
effectiveness of PST.  Three of the most commonly used criteria in the literature are those by  
[CONTACT_684790] [16], Feldma n et al, [13] and most recently Symmans and collaborators from the 
University of [LOCATION_007], MD Anderson Cancer Center. The first [ADDRESS_927835] part, differ from each other.  
In general, 60% to 90% of patients with invasive brea st cancer show clinical response;  however, 
only 3 % to 30% of patients achieve pCR. Two large studies using PST, NSABP B -[ADDRESS_927836] and axillary tissues removed at the time of surgery. [8]  
Symmans et al [17] showed a continuous index combining pathologic measurements of the 
primary tumor (size and cellularity) and n odal metastases (number and size) and tested as an 
independent predictor of distant relapse -free survival. Patients with minimal residual disease 
(RD) (RCB -I) carried the same prognosis as pCR (RCB -0).  On the other hand, patients with 
extensive RD (RCB -III) had poor prognosis.  RCB was independently prognostic in a 
multivariate model that included age, pretreatment clinical stage, hormone receptor status, 
hormone therapy, and pathologic response (pathologic complete response [pCR] vs. RD; hazard 
ratio = 2. 50; 95% CI 1.70 to 3.69; P < .001).  Seventeen per cent of patients had minimal RD 
(RCB -I). These patients carried the same prognosis as pCR (RCB -0).  Extensive RD (RCB -III) 
was seen in 13% of patients.  It was associated with poor prognosis, regardless of  hormone 
receptor status, adjuvant hormone therapy, or pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer 
stage of residual disease. The calculation formula and detailed description can be found at a 
dedicated Web site: http://www.mdanderson.org/breastcenter_RC B.  
2.4.  Phase II  and III  Randomized PST Breast Cancer Trials  
Several large Phase III trials investigated the efficacy of chemotherapy when is administered as 
PST compared with adjuvant systemic treatment.  
In [ADDRESS_927837] (NSABP) conducted a large 
phase III study (NSABP P -18) to compare PST and post -operative chemotherapy.  [7, 18, 19]A 
total of 1,[ADDRESS_927838] cancer were randomized to receive four cycles 
of doxoru bicin and  cyclophosphamide (AC) either as PST or adjuvant therapy. Breast tumor size 
was reduced in 79% of patient after PST, and 36% had a clinical complete response (cCR) rate, 
43% clinical partial response (cPR), and a 13% pCR. Clinical nodal response w as observed in 
2012 -0167

89% of patients with node -positive disease; 73% had nodal cCR, and 44% of these patients had 
pCR.  At 9 years, the authors reported no difference in DFS (67% for both groups) or OS (69% 
PST vs. 70% adjuvant groups; P = .80).  However, there was a favor trend in favor of PST in 
women less than 50 years old (HR 0.85, P = .053). The investigators reported that the use of PST 
improved BCS from 60% to 67% ( P < .01). Even with improved rates of BCS, there was no  
statistically significant difference  in the rate of local recurrence between treatment groups ( P = 
.12). A marginal increase in the rate of local recurrence for patients who were converted from 
proposed mastectomy to segmental mastectomy (15.9%) was seen when compared with patients 
who were eligible to undergo segmental mastectomy as per initial plan (9.9%) ( P = .04). This 
difference loses statistical significance after controlling for age and initial clinical tumor size.  
NSABP B -27, a large prospective randomized trial, [15, 20] was designed to evaluate whether 
the addition of docetaxel to AC PST would prolong DFS and OS and improve clinical and 
pathologic tumor response rates.  Women with operable breast cancer (n = 2,411) were randomly 
assigned to receive e ither [ADDRESS_927839] AC followed by [CONTACT_44850] (Group 1), 4 cycles of AC 
followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel, followed by [CONTACT_44850] (Group 2), or 4 cycles of AC followed by 
[CONTACT_684791] 4 cycles of docetaxel (Group 3).  The addition of docetaxel to AC increa sed 
pCR rate (26.1% vs 13.7%; P < .001).   pCR was a significant predictor of OS (HR 0.33, P < 
.0001).  The pathologic nodal status after chemotherapy was also a significant prognostic factor 
for OS ( P < .0001).     However, this study did not prospective a ssess the role docetaxel in 
patients with residual disease after PST AC.  There was no stratification after AC. The patients 
with all eight cycles of PST administered at front had a trend toward improvement in RFS. [15] 
One caveat with this study is that at the time it was conducted, all patients received tamoxifen, 
which was initiated concurrently with chemotherapy, regardless of hormone -receptor status. The 
simultaneous administration of tamoxifen and chemotherapy may have affect benefit from 
chemotherapy.  
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Trial [ADDRESS_927840] or 
adjuvant  FEC-100. [21] The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of 
timing of therapy on DFS and OS. A fter a follow -up of 4 -years the OS was 82% for PST group 
compared to 84% for those treated in the adjuvant setting ( P = .38). For patient who received 
PST, the overall response rate (ORR) (cCR + cPR) was 49% and cCR 7%. Thirteen of 350 
patients (4%) in the  PST group had a pCR. For this study, response was determined by [CONTACT_684792], possibly explaining the low overall 
clinical CR. PST was associated with an increased rate of 35% BCS compared to 22% for the 
control  group. The rate of locoregional recurrence was equivalent between treatment groups.  
The European Cooperative Trial in Operable (ECTO) Breast Cancer randomly tested the efficacy 
of postoperative chemotherapy doxorubicin followed by [CONTACT_207135], methot rexate, and 
5-fluorouracil (CMF) or doxorubicin and paclitaxel (AP) followed by [CONTACT_684793].  [22, 23] A total of 1,[ADDRESS_927841] ind uced a clinical response in 78% of the patients and pCR 23%. There was no significance 
in RFS when AP/CMF was given before surgery compared with the same regimen given after 
surgery (HR, 1.21; P = .18) However, the rate of breast -conserving surgery was sig nificantly 
higher with preoperative chemotherapy (63% vs. 34%; P < .001)  
[ADDRESS_927842] been published. Green et al [24] 
evaluated the role of paclitaxel given at two different schedules in the PST setting. In this study, 
[ADDRESS_927843] every 3 -weekly 
paclitaxel to determine if different schedules or dose densities of paclitaxel would achieve 
improved pCR rate. The doses of weekly paclitaxel varied based on clinical status of axillary 
nodes. Weekly paclitaxel was given at a dose of 80 mg/m2 for 12 weeks to those with node -
negative disease or 150 mg/m2 (3 we eks on and 1 week off) for four cycles to those with node -
positive disease. Standard paclitaxel was administered as 24 -hour infusion at 225 mg/m2 every 3 
weeks for four cycles. After completion of paclitaxel, all patients received FAC x 4 cycles. 
Clinical responses were similar in both groups ( P = .25). The pCR rates were higher in those 
who received weekly paclitaxel than those who received standard paclitaxel (28% vs.15.7%; P = 
.02) with an improved BC rate (47% vs. 38%; P = .05). There are already data s upporting the 
superiority of weekly paclitaxel over every 3 -weekly paclitaxel in the adjuvant setting reported 
in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 1199 [25] and in the metastatic setting 
reported in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9840. [26]  
Lastl y, Buzdar el al [27] compared two taxane schedule s (weekly paclitaxel [WP] x 12 versus 3 -
week docetaxel plus capecitabine (DC) x 4 cycles, followed by: [CONTACT_456363] -100 x 4 cycles. Patients 
were randomized 1:1 and stratified by [CONTACT_684794] (PST vs. adjuvant). A total of 216 
patients were treated with PS T and 107 were randomized to WP arm and 109 to DC arm. The 
pCR rates were 18.7% and 17.4% on each arm, respectively ( P = .81). The DC arm had higher 
incidence of hand foot syndrome, and myelosuppression, and WP treatment higher neurotoxicity. 
The primary e ndpoint was DFS, and the secondary endpoint pCR. The study was designated to 
include [ADDRESS_927844] 80% power. An interim analysis in June [ADDRESS_927845] setting had same efficacy and WP was associated with better tolerance and less toxicity.  
2.5. Current Primary Systemic Chemotherapy Regimens  
Pathological complete response rates are generally higher with anthracycline -based combinations 
than w ith regimens not containing anthracycline  (doxorubicin or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962] ). Consequently, 
most PST regimens for breast cancer are anthracycline -based combination: AC 
(doxorubicin/ Cyclophosphamide ); FAC (fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide); CE 
(cyclophosp hamide/epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]); and FEC (fluorouracil/epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]/cyclophosphamide). However, 
other non -anthracycline based drug combinations, such as CMF 
(cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) with or without a taxane, are also in common use. 
Increased duration of chemotherapy administration from 12 to 18 weeks or longer improves pCR 
rates. [6] The addition of paclitaxel or docetaxel to anthracyclines based regimes has resulted in 
pCR of up to 28.2%. [24] The Aberdeen  study showed that tumors that did not respond to an 
anthracycline -based regimen may respond to docetaxel. Additionally sequential and non-
concomitant  addition of taxane to anthracycline -based chemotherapy results in higher pCR rates.

2.6. Primary Systemic Therapy in  Operable Breast Cancer  
The Breast Medical Oncology Department at MD Anderson has been one of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_684774]. The sequential or concurrent 
administration of taxane and anthracycline c onstitute the backbone of early breast cancer 
treatment. At MD Anderson Cancer Center our current standard of care for the treatment of 
breast cancer is the sequential administration of paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV, weekly for 12 cycles 
followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regim en, IV, every 3 week s for 4 cycles. [15]  This treatment is 
administered for a total of [ADDRESS_927847] reduces the size of the primary tumor and lymph 
node metastasis in greater than 80% of cases, increasing the probability that breast -conserving 
surgery can be performed. [13-16] A second advantage o f this sequencing schedule is that it 
permits the assessment of response of the primary tumor to the particular chemotherapy regimen. 
This assessment allows the opportunity to “cross -over” to a different regimen for an individual 
patient if there is minima l or no response to the first regimen. These and other theoretic 
advantages for PST must be balanced carefully with other aspects of individual patient 
management.  
Most of the reports of combined -modality treatment for LABC were based on treatment 
programs  that included anthracycline -containing combination of chemotherapy regimens, such as 
2012 -0167  
October 22, 2014  
Page 11 
 
fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide  (FAC) or FEC when the anthracycline used 
was Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962] . Since the introduction of taxanes over the past decade, there hav e been several 
reports in which an anthracycline and taxane combination was utilized.  
One of the first considerations for studying PST for breast carcinoma was to investigate whether 
earlier delivery of chemotherapy offered the possibility of improved survival in patients with 
locally advanced breast carcinoma. To test these concepts, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast 
and Bowel Project (NSABP) began the B -[ADDRESS_927848] whether sequencing chemotherapy 
before surgery would improve outcomes . [13-15]  The trial enrolled [ADDRESS_927849] carcinoma and randomized them to receive four cycles of 
doxorubicin/ Cyclophosphamide (AC) either before or after surgical treatment. The primary end 
points of this trial we re disease -free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). With respect to 
these end points, the trial was a negative study. After 9 years, the OS and DFS were nearly 
identical between the two groups ( P = .80, P =0.5, respectively). A second large randomize d 
prospective trial that directly compared the sequencing of chemotherapy and surgery was 
performed by [CONTACT_684795] (EORTC ). [16] 
This trial randomized 698 patients to pre operative or postoperative chemotherapy comprised of 
four cycles of FEC (5 -Fluorouracil, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], and C yclophosphamide). Like the NSABP B -18 
trial, the EORTC study demonstrated equivalent survival and rates of distant metastases between 
the two treatmen t arms.  
Gianni el al, [17] randomized 1,[ADDRESS_927850] cancer > 2 cm to three groups: adjuvant 
doxorubicin (A) follo wed by [CONTACT_207135], methotrexate, and 5 -FU (CMF) 
(Sx→A→CMF); adjuvant doxorubicin and paclitaxel (AT) followed by [CONTACT_684796] (Sx→AT→CMF); 
and neoadjuvant AT followed by [CONTACT_684796] (AT→CMF→Sx). pCR rates in the neoadjuvant arm 
were 23% in breast only and 20% in brea st plus axilla patients. The breast conservative treatment 
rate was also better in this arm (65% vs. 34%; P <.001). At [ADDRESS_927851] in terms of freedom for progression ( P =.24) and OS ( P = .81)  
A recent me ta-analysis addressed directly the question of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant 
chemotherapy. [18]  Nine randomized clinical trials involving 3,[ADDRESS_927852] was associated with a higher locoregional recurrence (risk ratio, 
[RR] 1.22; P = .15). This greater risk was largely attributed to those trials in which radiation 
alone without surgery was used in patients who achieved a clinical complete response to PST. 
(RR, 1.53; P =.009).  
2.7. Role of the Pathological Complete Response in Breast Cancer  
A pathological complete response (pCR) implies the absence of residual invasive  disease 
following PST. Pathological complete response is associated with long -term survival, and has 
been adopted as the primary end point for neoadjuvant trials.  While it is generally held that a 
definition of pCR should include patients without residua l invasive carcinoma in the breast 
(pT0), the presence of nodal metastasis, minimal residual cellularity, and residual in situ 
carcinoma are not consistently defined as pCR or residual disease (RD). When there is no 
residual invasive cancer in the breast, the number of involved axillary lymph nodes is inversely 
related to survival.  [19] Conversely, patients who convert to node -negative status after treatment 
have excellent survival, ev en if there is RD in the breast. [20] Symmans and collaborators, [33] 
[ADDRESS_927853] cancer burden (RCB) index as a novel independent new risk 
factor that improves the predict ion of distant relapse after PST compared with currently used risk 
factors. RBC can be divided in four categories: patients with minimal residual disease ( RCB -I) 
have the same 5 -year prognosis as those with pCR ( RCB -0), irrespective of the type of 
neoadjuv ant chemotherapy administered, adjuvant hormonotherapy, or the pathologic stage of 
RD. Extensive RD ( RCB -III) was associated with poor prognosis, irrespective of the type of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered, adjuvant hormontherapy or the pathologic st age of 
RCB. 
2.8.  Primary Systemic Therapy: Sequential versus Alternating Regimens  
Several important observation regarding the sequence of anthracycline and taxane -based 
treatment during PST have raised the question which sequence of treatment will be most  
favorable to impact in the pCR rates and outcome (DFS and OS) of breast cancer patients. 
Anthracyclines are usually administered before taxanes (or combined with taxanes), a practice 
which reflects the sequence of administration used in clinical trials ra ther than research -based 
evidence.  
Miller et al [34] published in [ADDRESS_927854] cancer. Seventy patients were treated with the dose dense sequence 
doxorubicin (75 mg/m2 every 2 weeks, 3 cycles) followed by [CONTACT_114501] (40 mg/m2 weekly, 6 
cycles) (A D) or the vice versa sequence D A. Patients treated with D A had a pCR rate 17% 
compared with the sequence of A D with a pCR rate of 8.6%. In the sequence D A the 
relative dose intensity (RDI) for A and D were 0.94 and 0.97, respectively. The sequence A D 
resulted in RDI  for A and D were 0.95 and 0.85, respectively.  
The Neo-tAnGo  is a large randomized phase III study conducted in [LOCATION_008], comparing 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_118713] (E/C) followed by [CONTACT_684797][INVESTIGATOR_684775]. (E/C Pac+/ -Gem vs. Pac+/ -Gem EC). [35]   A total of [ADDRESS_927855] as well in the axillary lymph nod es. Patient 
characteristics were well balanced in both arms. The pCR rates were identical for EC  T (17%)  
compared with the  EC  T+Gem sequence  (P = .98). However, the sequence T+/ - Gem  EC, 
showed a pCR of 20% compared with 15% for the EC then T+/ -Gem (P = .03). Adjustment by 
[CONTACT_684798].  
Similarly, Alvarez et al [36]analyzed retrospectively the sequence of chemotherapy with tax anes 
and anthracyclines in 1,[ADDRESS_927856] at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 
1991 and 2009. A total of 1 188 patients ( 84%) received the sequence taxane followed by 
[CONTACT_511787]. (T A) and 226 patients ( 16%) received the sequence of anthracycline followed 
by [CONTACT_123502] (A T). A total of 2 49 patients (2 1%) achieved a pCR in the T A sequence compared 
with 28 patients (1 2.3%) in the A T sequence. ( P = .00 4). In addition, for all patients that were 
treated with the sequence T A the 5 -year and 10 -year DFS rates were 78.9% and 6 1.4%, 
respectively. ( P = .0001) For patients treated with the sequence A T, the 5 -year and 10 -year 
DFS rates were 57.5% and 45.2%, respectively.  (P = .0001).  
These three studies demonstrated evidence that dose delivery and efficacy improve when taxane 
is given first with less immediate toxicity. Several ongoing randomized adjuvant trials, such as 
SOLD and NSABP -B40, taxanes are now given before anthracyclines.

3. ERIBULIN (HALAVEN ®) 
3.1 Description  
Eribulin mesylate (Halaven®) is a non -taxane microtubule dynam ics inhibitor. Eribulin is a 
synthetic analogue of halichondrin B , a product isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria 
okadai.  The chemical name [CONTACT_313885] 11,15:21:24,28 -Triepoxy -7,9-ethano -12.15 -

methanesulfonnate (salt). It has a molecular weight of 82 6.0 (729.9 for free base). The empi[INVESTIGATOR_6920] C 40 H59NO 11.CH 4O3S. Eribulin mesylate has the following structural formula:  
 
Eribulin is clear, colorless, sterile solution for intravenous administration. Each vial contains 1  
mg of eribulin mesylate as  a 0.5 mg/mL solution in ethanol: water (5:95)  
3.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
3.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and 
sequesters tubu lin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exer ts its effects via a tubulin -based 
antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell -cycle block, disruption of mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874], and 
ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage.  
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_927857] s of eribulin on the QTc interval  was assessed in an open -label, uncontrolled, 
multicenter, single -arm dedicated QT trial. A total of 26 patients with solid tumors received 1.4 
mg/m2 of eribulin on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle. A delayed QTc prolongation  was observed 
on Day 8, with no prolongation observed on Day 1. The maximum mean QTcF change from 
baseline (95% upper confidence interval) was 11.4 (19.5) ms.

3.2.3 Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of eribulin is linear with a mean elimination half -life of approximately 40 
hours, a mean volume of distribution of 43 L/M2 to 114/m2 and mean clearance of 1.16 L/hr/m2 
to 2.42 L/hr/m2 over the dose range of 0.25 mg/m2 to 4.0 mg/m2. The human plasma protein 
binding of eribulin at concentra tions of 100 ng/mL to 1,000 ng/mL ranges from 49% to 65% 
eribulin exposure after multiple dosing is comparable to that following a single dose. No 
accumulation of eribulin is observed with weekly administration.  
3.3 Metabolism  
Unchanged eribulin was the major circulating species in pla sma following administration of C-
eribulin to patients. Metabolite concentrations represented <0.6% of parent compound, 
confirming that there are no major human metabolites of eribulin.  
Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) negligibl y metabolizes eribulin in vitro . Eribulin inhibits 
CYP3A4 activity in human liver microsomes, but it is unlikely that eribulin will substantially 
increase the plasma level of CYP3A4 substrates. Eribulin shows no induction potential for 
CYP1A, CYP2C9, CYP2C 19, and CYP3A in primary hepatocytes. No significant inhibition of 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2E1 was detected with eribulin concentrations 
up to 5 M in pooled human liver microsomes. In vitro  drug interaction studies indicate that 
eribulin do es not inhibit drugs that are substrates of these enzymes and it is unlikely that eribulin 
will affect plasma levels of drugs that are substrates of CYP enzymes. Eribulin is a substrate and 
a week inhibitor of the drug efflux transporter P -gp in vitro . 
3.4 Elimination  
Eribulin is eliminated primarily in feces unchanged. After administration of 14C -eribulin to 
patients, approximately 82% of the dose was eliminated in feces and 9% in urine. Unchanged 
eribulin accounted for approximately 88% and 91% of the dos e in feces and urine, respectively.  
3.[ADDRESS_927858] not been conducted with eribulin mesylate.  
Eribulin mesylate was not mutagenic in in vitro  bacterial reverse mutation assays (Ames test). 
Eribulin mesylate was positive in mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assa ys, and wa s clastogenic in 
an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.  
The effects of eribulin on human fertility are unknown. Fertility studies have not been conducted 
with eribulin mesylate in humans or animals. However, nonclinical findings in repeated -dose do g 
and rat toxicology studies suggest that male fertility may be compromised by [CONTACT_684799]. Rats exhibited testicular toxicity (hypocellularity of seminiferous epi[INVESTIGATOR_684776]/aspermia) following dosing with eribulin mesyla te at or above 0.43 times the 
recommended human dose (mg/m2) given once weekly for 3 weeks, or at or above 0.21 times the 
recommended human dose (mg/m2) given once weekly for 3 out of 5 weeks, repeated for 6 
cycles. Testicular toxicity was also observed in  dogs given 0.64 times the recommended human 
dose (mg/m2) weekly for [ADDRESS_927859] chemotherapeutic 
regimen.  [1]  Patients were required to receive prior anthracycline - and taxane - based 
chemotherapy for adjuvant or metastatic disease. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive 
eribulin (n=508) or a single agent therapy selected prior to randomization (control arm, n=254). 
Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_1617], HER2/ neu status, and prior capecitabine 
exposure. Eribulin was administered at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -dayy. 
Eribulin -treated patients received a median of 5 cycles (range: 1 to 23 cycles) of therapy.  
Control arm t herapy consisted of 97% chemotherapy (25% vinorelbine, 18% gemcitabine, 18% 
capecitabine, 16% taxane, 9% anthracycline, 10% other chemotherapy), or 3% hormonal 
therapy. The main efficacy outcome was overall survival.  
Patients demographic and baseline chara cteristics were comparable between the treatment arms. 
The median age was 55 (range: 27 to 85 years) and 92% were White. Sixty -four percent of the 
patients were enrolled in North America/Western Europe/Australia, 25% in Eastern 
Europe/Russia, and 11% in La tin America/South Africa. Ninety -one percent of patients have  a 
baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Tumor prognostic characteristics, including 
estrogen receptor status (positive: 67%, negative: 28%), progesterone receptor status (positive: 
49%, ne gative 39%), HER2/ neu receptor status (positive: 16%, negative: 74%), triple negative 
status (ER-, PR-, HER2/ neu-: 19%), presence of visceral disease (82%, including 60% liver and 
38% lung) and bone disease (61%) and number of sites of metastases (greater than two: 50%), 
were also similar in the eribulin and control arms. Patients received a median of four prior 
chemotherapy regimens in both arms.  
In Study 1, a statistically significant improvement in overall survival was observed in patients 
randomized to the eribulin arm compared to the control arm (see Table 2). An updated unplanned 
survival analysis, conducted when 77% of events had been observed (see Figure 1) was 
consistent with the primary analysis. In patients randomized to eribulin, the objective re sponse 
rate by [CONTACT_684800] 11% (95% CI: 8.6%, 14.3%) and the median response duration 
was 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.8, 5.0 months) .

3.10 Warning and Precautions  
3.10.1 Neutropenia  
Severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm3) lasting more than one w eek occurred in 12% (62/503) of  
patients in Study 1, leading to discontinuation in <1% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6)].  
Patients with alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase > 3 × ULN (upper limit of  
normal) experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia than 
patients with normal aminotransferase levels. Patients with bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN also had a  
higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.  Monitor complete blood counts  
prior to each dose; increase the frequency of monitoring in  patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 
cytopenias. Delay administration of Eribulin  and reduce  subsequent doses in patients who 
experience febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting  longer tha n 7 days. Clinical studies 
of Eribulin  did not  include patients with baseline neutrophil counts below 1,500/mm3.  
3.10.2 Peripheral Neuropathy  
Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8% (40/503) of patients, and Grade 4 in 0.4% (2/503)  
of patients in Stud y 1. Peripheral neuropathy was the most common toxicity leading to  
discontinuation of Eribulin  (5% of patients; 24/503). Neuropathy lasting more than one year  
occurred in 5% (26/503) of patients. Twenty -two percent (109/503) of patients developed a new  
or worsening neuropathy that had not recovered within a median follow -up duration of 269 days  
(range 25 -662 days). Monitor patients closely for signs of peripheral motor and sensory  
neuropathy. Withhold Eribulin  in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 periphe ral neuropathy  
until resolution to Grade 2 or less.  
3.10.3 Embryo -Fetal Toxicity  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of Eribulin  in pregnant women.  Eribulin  is a 
microtubule inhibitor; therefore, it is expected to cause fetal harm when  admini stered to a 
pregnant woman. Embryo -fetal toxicity and teratogenicity occurred in rats that  received eribulin 
mesylate at approximately half of the recommended human dose based on body  surface area. If 
this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient bec omes pregnant while taking  this drug, she 
should be apprised of th e potential hazard to the fetus.  
  
[ADDRESS_927862] hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to  
initiating Eribulin  and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid  Eribulin  in 
patients with congenital long QT syndrome.   
3.11 Dosage and Administration  
3.11.1 Recommended Dose  
The recommended dose of Eribulin  is 1.4 mg/m2 administered intravenously over  2 to 5  minutes 
on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle.  
The recommended dose of Eribulin  in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh A)  is 
1.1 mg/m2 administe red intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle.  
The recommended dose of Eribulin  in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh  B) 
is 0.7 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day cy cle. 
The recommended dose of Eribulin  in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine  
clearance of 30 -50 mL/min) is 1.1 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on 
Days  1 and 8 of a 21 -day cycle.  
3.11.2 Dose Modification  
Assess for peri pheral neuropathy and obtain complete blood cell counts prior to each dose.   
Recommended dose delays  
Do not administer Eribulin  on Day 1 or Day 8 for any of the following:  
− ANC < 1,000/mm3  
− Platelets < 75,000/mm3  
− Grade 3 non -hematologic AEs  (except constitutional symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle aches, 
insomnia, dry mouth and sweating; and skin changes such as dry skin, pruritus, and nail 
changes; and constipation) should have all study treatment immediately inte rrupted pending 
investigator determination of whether the AEs are related or not related to study treatment.  
 
- The use of G -CSF (granulocyte colony -stimulating factor) or GM -CSF (granulocyte –
macrophage colony -stimulating factor) is recommended for patien ts who receive Eribulin and 
at treating physician discretion.  
If toxicities resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 8, resume Eribulin at 1.4 mg/m²  
 
 
 
The Day 8 dose may be delayed for a maximum of 1 week.  
− If toxicities do not resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, omit the dose.  
− If toxicities resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, administer Eribulin  at a 
reduced dose and initiate the next cycle no sooner than ≥ [ADDRESS_927863] recovered to Grade 2 severity or  less, 
resume Eribulin  at a reduced dose as set out in Table 3. 
Do not re -escalate Eribulin  dose after it has been reduced.  
 
Eribulin dose calculation for patients with BSA of > 2.0. The research nurse will notify the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_684777].  
 
It is well known that obese patients have a high risk to be overdosed using standard BSA 
measures, especially for highly myelotoxic drugs like eribulin. Therefore, for patients that are 
going to be treated with eribulin and their BSA >2.0.  We are rounding down  the BSA to 2. This 
will allow us to manage her blood toxicity more efficiently.

3.12 Adverse Reactions  
The following adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling:  
• Neutropenia  
• Peripheral neuropathy  
• QT interval prolongation  
The most common adverse reactions (≥  25%) reported in patients receiving Eribulin  were  
neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation.  
The most common ser ious adverse reactions reported in patients receiving Eribulin  were  febrile 
neutropenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). The most common adverse reaction resulting in  
discontinuation of Eribulin  was peripheral neuropathy (5%).   
Because clinical trials are conduc ted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates  
observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials  
and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  
In clinical trials, Eribulin  has been administered to 1,222 patients with multiple tumor types,  
including 240 patients exposed to Eribulin  for 6 months or longer. The majority of the 1,222  
patients were women (82%) with a median age of 58 years (range: 26 to 91 years). The racial 
and ethnic distribution was Caucasian (83%), Black (5%), Asian (2%), and other (5%).  
The adverse reactions described in Table 2 were identified in 750 patients treated in Study 1. In 
Study 1, patients were randomized (2:1) to recei ve either Eribulin  (1.4 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 
of a 21 -day cycle) or single agent treatment chosen by [CONTACT_9682]  (control group). A total of 
503 patients received  Eribulin , and 247 patients in the control  group received therapy consisting 
of chemothera py [total 97% (anthracyclines 10%, capecitabine  18%, gemcitabine 19%, taxanes 
15%, vinorelbine 25%, other chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 10%)] or hormonal  therapy (3%). The median 
duration of exposure was [ADDRESS_927865] 10% of patients in either group.

enzymes  or induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 enzymes at relevant clinical 
concentrations.  Eribulin is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of drugs that are  
substrates of these  enzymes.

3.13.3 Use in Specific Populations  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Category D  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies with Eribulin  in pregnant women.  Eribulin  is a 
microtubule inhibitor;  therefore, it is expected to cause fetal harm when  administered to a 
pregnant woman. Embryo -fetal toxicity and teratogenicity occurred in rats that  received eribulin 
mesylate at approximately half of the recommended human dose based on body  surface area. If 
this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while  taking this drug, the 
patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.   
In a developmental toxicity study, pregnant rats received intravenous infusion of eribul in 
mesylate  during organogenesis (Gestation Days 8, 10, and 12) at doses approximately 0.04, 0.13, 
0.43 and  0.64 times the recommended human dose, based on body surface area (mg/m2). 
Increased  abortion and severe external or soft tissue malformations were observed in offspring at 
doses  0.64 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area (mg/m2), including 
the absence of a lower jaw, tongue, stomach and spleen. Increased embryo -fetal death/resorption,  
reduced fetal weights, and minor skeletal an omalies consistent with developmental delay were  
also reported at or above doses of 0.43 times the recommended human dose.   
Maternal toxicity of eribulin mesylate was reported in rats at or above doses of 0.43 times the  
recommended human dose (mg/m²), and included enlarged spleen, reduced maternal weight gain  
and decreased food consumption.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether Eribulin  is excreted into human milk. No studies in humans or  animals 
were conducted to determine if Eribulin  is excrete d into milk. Because many drugs  are excreted 
into human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in human  milk fed 
infants from Eribulin , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue Eribulin  taking into  account the importance of the drug to the mother.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pediatric Use  
The safety and effectiveness of Eribulin  in pediatric patients below the age of [ADDRESS_927870]  not 
been established.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Geriatric Use  
Study 1 did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine  
whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Of the 827 subjects who received the  
recommended dose and schedule of Eribulin  in clinical studies, 15% (121/827) were 65 and  
older,  and 2% (17/827) patients were 75 and older. No overall differences in safety were 
observed  between these subjects and younger subjects.  
3.13.4 Hepatic Impairment  
A study evaluated the PK of eribulin in patients with mild (Child -Pugh A; n=7) and moderate  
(Child -Pugh B; n=5) hepatic impairment. Compared to patients with normal hepatic function  
(n=6), eribulin exposure increased 1.8 -fold and 2.5 -fold in patients with mild and moderate  
hepatic impairment, respectively. Administration of Eribulin  at a dose of 1.1 mg/m2 to  patients 
with mild hepatic impairment and 0.7 mg/m2 to patients with moderate hepatic  impairment 
2012 -0167  
October 22, 2014  
Page 25 
 
resulted in similar exposure to eribulin as a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 to patients with normal  hepatic 
function. A lower starting dose of 1.1 mg /m2 is recommended for patients with mild  hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh A) and of 0.7 mg/m2 is recommended for patients with moderate  
hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh B). Eribulin  was not studied in patients with s  severe hepatic  
impairment (Child -Pugh C).  
3.13.5 Renal Impairment  
No formal PK trials were conducted with Eribulin  in patients with renal impairment. Available  
data suggests that no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl  
50-80 mL/min). However, for patients with  moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 -50 mL/min), 
the geometric mean dose -normalized systemic exposure increased 2 -fold compared to patients 
with normal renal function. A lower starting dose of 1.1 mg/m2 is recommended for patients 
with moderate renal impair ment. The safety of Eribulin  was not studied in patients with severe  
renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).  
3.13.6 Overdosage  
Over dosage  of Eribulin  has been reported at approximately 4 times the recommended dose,  
which resulted in Grade 3 neutropenia lastin g seven days and a Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction  
lasting one day.   There is no known antidote for Eribulin  overdose.

4.3 Drug Administration  Plan  
 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_684802], estrogen and progesterone expression 
status and Investigator Site.  
 
ARM 1: Patients will receive Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IVPB over 1 hour weekly for 12 doses  
followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC.  
 
ARM  2: Patients will receive eribuli n 1.4 mg/m2 IV infusion  or per institutional  guidelines  over 
2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles (21 day cycle)  followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC.  
 
Patients on both arms  will receive either  FEC or FAC x 4 cycles (21 day cycle) at the 
preference of the treating physicians . 
 
FEC Chemotherapy:  
• 5-Flurouracil 500mg/m2 IV on day 1  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962] 100mg/m2 IV on day 1  
• Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 IV on day 1  
 
FAC Chemotherapy: ( may be g iven instead of FEC)  
• 5-Flurouraci l 500mg/m2 IV on day 1  
• Doxorubicin 50mg/m2 IV on day 1 over 30 minutes continuous infusion or IV 
bolus  (as per institutional standard)  
• Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 IV on day [ADDRESS_927874] 12 week s of treatment will discontinue eribulin or paclitaxel and will automatically be 
considered non -responders to eribulin or paclitaxel and then will start th e FAC/FEC -regimen.  
 
Patients who progress outside of the breast /present with metastatic disease will be taken off 
study. We will attempt to confirm progression histologically (biopsy).  
 
Patients  who discontinue  eribulin or paclitaxel prior to 12 weeks due  to toxicity will be 
evaluated for response to FAC/FEC -regimen unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_684779] (e.g., subjects with large tumors that progress 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_684780] .) If pr ogressive disease occurs while on FAC/FEC - treatment, 
chemotherapy will be discontinued and the subject s should remain on the study until after they 
have undergone definitive surgery.  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_927875] dose of FAC/FEC -
regimen . It is up to the surgeon’s discretion if tumors must be removed by [CONTACT_684803] (i.e. breast conservation surgery) or modified radical mastectomy (i.e. 
mastectomy with axill ary clearance)  after discussion with the patient .  The surgical specimens

interests of the patients.  
 
4.9 Criteria for Response  
The primary endpoint of this study is to assess pathologic complete response (pCR) will be 
determined based on the routine clinical pathology report. Response categories will be assigned 
as follows:  
Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined in this study as complete absence of any viable 
invasive cancer cells in the resected breast and lymph nodes.  
  
2012 -0167

Page 38 
 
4.9.1 Definition of Residual Cancer Burden  
We will measure the residual cancer burden (RCB) as a continuous variable derived from the 
primary tumor dimensions, cellularity of the tumor bed, and axillary nodal burden. RCB can also 
divid ed in four classes (RCB -0 to RCB -III) 
RCB -0 (pCR), Minimal RCB (RCB -I), Moderate RCB (RCB -II), and Extensive RCB (RCB -III) 
The following parameters are required from pathologic examination in order to calculate 
Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) after neoadjuvan t treatment:  
 
1. The largest two dimensions (mms) of the residual tumor bed in the breast (largest tumor bed 
if multicentric disease)   
2. Submission of the entire largest cross -sectional area of the residual tumor bed for histologic 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], with specific iden tification of those slides in the pathology report (e.g. "the largest 
cross -sectional area of primary tumor bed was submitted in cassettes A5 - A9")  
• If the residual tumor is large (i.e. largest diameter > 5 cm), then at least [ADDRESS_927892] cross -sectional area are sufficient, but should be identified in 
the original pathology report (e.g. "representative sections from the largest cross -
sectional area of primary tumor bed were submitted in cassettes A5 - A9")  
3. Histologic assess ment of the percentage of the tumor bed area that contains carcinoma (all 
carcinoma, i.e. invasive and in situ), select one of the following:   
0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%  
• To assess cellularity it is helpful to scan across the sections of tumor bed and then 
estimate the average cellularity from the different microscopic fields.   
• When estimating percentage cancer cellularity in any microscopic field, compare the 
involved area with obvious standards, e.g. more or less than half, one quarter, one fifth, 
one tenth, one twentieth, etc.   
• Expect there to be variable cellularity within the cross section of any tumor bed, but 
estimate the overall cellularity from the average of the estimates in different microscopic 
fields of the tumor bed.   
• e.g. if cellularity in different fields of the tumor bed were estimated as 20%, 10%, 20%, 
0%, 20%, 30%, then an average estimate of overall cellularity would be 20%.  
4. Histologic estimate of the percentage of the carcinoma in the tumor bed that is in  situ, select 
one of the following:    
0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%

5. CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
Research Hypothesis: Sequential administration of eribulin followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen, has 
greater activ ity based on pCR rate to the historical sequential administration of paclitaxel 
followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen as neoadjuvant therapy for women with early breast cancer with 
tumors that do not overexpress HER -2.  
5.1 Hot Spot Mutation Analysis Methodology: DN A will be extracted using the QiaAMP 
microkit (Qiagen Inc. Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.  A mass 
spectroscopy -based approach evaluating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be used to 
detect known mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1,  AKT2, AKT3, PHLPP2, mTOR,  Rictor, PDPK1, 
MC1R, BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, MEK1, MEK2, NRAS, RAF1, PRKAG1, GNAC, EGFR, FGFR1, 
FGFR2, FGFR3, KIT, VGFR, ER, MET, ALK, GNAS, CDK4, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, FBXW7, 
JAK2, RET, FLT3 . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and extension pr imers for each gene will be 
designed using Sequenom, Inc. (San Diego, CA) Assay Design. PCR -amplified DNA will be 
cleaned using EXO -SAP (Sequenom) primer extended by [CONTACT_684806], desalted using 
Clean Resin (Sequenom) and spotted onto Spectrochip matrix  chips using a nanodispenser 
(Samsung).  Chips will be run in duplicate on a Sequenom MassArray MALDI -TOF MassArray 
system. Sequenom Typer Software and visual inspection will be used to interpret mass spectra.  
Reactions where more than 15% of the resultan t mass runs in the mutant site in both reactions 
will be scored as positive.  
5.2 Molecular Inversion Probes (MIP) Arrays Methodology: The MIP assay has been described,  
[37] including a study conducted by [CONTACT_684807]. DNA is 
extracted from tumor material that has at least 80% tumor cells based on review by a dedicated 
breast cancer pathologist by [CONTACT_684808] a Qi agen cocktail (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). MIP 
probes are oligonucleotides with two complementary end sequences to two adjacent genomic 
sequences, such that the ends anneal to the DNA in an inverted fashion with a single ‘detector’ 
base between. The ‘detector’ can be either the site of a germline SNP or a somatic mutation that 
occurs as a single nucleotide change. The MIP probe is hybridized to genomic DNA and split 
into two tubes that contain paired fluorescent nucleotide mixes (triphosphates of A+T or C+G). 
In the presence of polymerase and ligase, the MIP probe circularizes with the complementary 
nucleotide. An important advantage of the MIP technology is that allelic discrimination is 
enzymatically derived, fluorescent, and highly specific, allowing for multi plexed assays 
(presently 330,000 probes) with very precise quantization  of signals. There is no “bleed through” 
of a second allele, as often happens with the differential hybridization in standard SNP arrays. 
Critical for small samples such as biopsies and  FFPE (where it is challenging if not impossible to 
perform robust whole genome amplification), MIP arrays provide accurate results with only 37 
ng of input DNA, which is an order of magnitude lower than that required for SNP arrays.  
5.3 CTCs blood collec tion: Cytokines and Micro RNA.A 10 -mL red -top Vaccutainer tube will 
be collected to measure serum levels of soluble markers using Millipore 37 -Plex Luminex 
multiplex assay. Additionally, we will isolate total mRNA for the detection of micro RNAs by 
[CONTACT_937]-PCR.  The miRNA to be assessed are miR -221, miR -222, miR -17-5p, miR -17-3p, miR -18a, 
miR-19a, miR -20a, miR -19b, miR -92-1, let -7f and miR -27b, U6 (control).  
CTC measurement:  [ADDRESS_927893] assay.  
EMT CTC: 7 ml of peripheral blood in EDTA (purple top Vaccutainer) will be collected for the 
isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and subsequently d epletion of

detection of EMT -inducing transcription factor transcripts by [CONTACT_937] -PCR.     
Patients agreeing to participate in optional procedures will have the correlative samples 
obtained when logistically feasible. Optional procedures not obtained will not be 
considered protocol deviations.  
 
 
 
6. STUDY DRUG COMPLIANCE  AND  ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_927894] not be used outside the context of the protocol.  
Under no circumstances should the investigator or other site personnel supply study drug to other 
investigators, patients, or clinic s, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by [CONTACT_47375].  
7. Adverse Event Reporting and data collection  
7.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event (AE) is any condition that appears or worsens after the subject is enrolled in an 
investigational study.  AE’s will be graded by [CONTACT_684809] (CTCAE) version 4.0 (http://ct ep.cancer. 
gov/forms/CTCAEv 4. pdf). Adverse Events not included in the defined NCI CTCAE should be 
scored according to their impact on the subject’s ability to perform daily activities as follows:  
• Mild: no limitations to normal activities  
• Moderate: cause s some limitations to normal activities  
• Severe: causes inability to carry out usual activities of daily living Reporting 
Requirements for Baseline Adverse Events  
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an AE, when 
possible it is to be documented as ‘Course Zero’ using CTC/CTCAE terminology and grade. An 
expedited AE report is not required if a patient is entered on a protocol with a pre -existing 
condition (e.g., elevated laboratory value, diarrhea). The baseline AE m ust be re -assessed 
throughout the trial and reported if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines.  
• If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must reassess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required.  
• If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re -assess the event to determine 
if an expedited report is required. No modification in grading is to be made to account for 
abnormalities existing at baseline.  
7.[ADDRESS_927895] (IRB) via the Office of Protocol Research (OPR). SAEs will be 
required to be reported from the time that consent is signed, during t he course of treatment and 
[ADDRESS_927896] day of active treatment. Beyond 30 days of treatment, completion of 
only those SAEs that, in the judgment of the investigator, are definitely, possibly or probably 
related to the study treatment will  required to be reported.  All SAEs should be reported:  
Within 24 hours from the time the PI [INVESTIGATOR_69108]: All events resulting in a 
participant’s death.  
Within 5 working days from the time the PI [INVESTIGATOR_69108]: All serious AEs  other 
than that stated in point #1.  
7.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting to Eisai   
Within [ADDRESS_927897] awareness of the event (immediately if the event is fatal or life -
threatening), Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_684785] a ny Serious Adverse 
Event (“SAE,” as defined below) that occurs during the SAE reporting period (as defined below) 
in a Study subject assigned to receive the Eisai  Product.  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_684786] .  SAEs should be reported as soon as they are determined to meet the 
definition, even if complete information is not yet available.   
7.[ADDRESS_927898]. 7, 
1997 as those events, occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death,  
• Is immediately life -threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect  
• Any other medical event that, in the medical judgment of the Principal Investigator, 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above is also considered an SAE. A planned medical or 
surgical procedure is not, in itself, an SAE.  
• In addition, events that may not meet these criteria, but  which the investigator finds 
very unusual and/or potentially serious, will also be reported in the same manner. All 
SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the patient’s participation in the s tudy, must be followed until 
either:  
• The event resolves, or  
• The event stabilizes, or  
• The event returned to baseline if a baseline value is available, or  
• The event can be attributed to other than the study drug or other than study conduct.  
7.5 Adverse Event Data Collection  
The following information will be collected for all adverse events:  
• Start and stop dates  
• Severity (grade)  
• Relationship to study drug (attribution)  
Whether or not the subject discontinued treatment due to the AE  
Note all A Es on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (CRF) whether or not related to study 
drug.  
2012 -0167

AE grading and assignment of attribution require documentation by [CONTACT_684810].  
7.6 AE/SAE Follo w up  
All AEs/SAEs, including laboratory abnormalities, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684787], will be followed up according to good medical practices.  
 
NOTE: If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event rep orting period for non -
serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it 
occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last dose of investigational 
product, irrespective of any interveni ng treatment .  
  
[ADDRESS_927899] cancer not overexpressing HER -2 is pathologic complete response (pCR).  Patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio electronically into two groups by [CONTACT_684811]’s Clinical Oncology Res earch System (CORe).   
Group 2  will receive sequential Eribulin followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen chemotherapy and 
Group 1  will receive sequentia l paclitaxel followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen chemotherapy 
(MDACC standard of care).   
The primary objective is to compare the pCR rate of eribulin followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen to 
the pCR rate of paclitaxel followed by [CONTACT_684789]/FEC -regimen in HER -[ADDRESS_927900] 
stage is less than -0.876, the trial will stop for futilit y; else, the trial will continue until [ADDRESS_927901] statistic greater than 1.272 at the end of the 
second stage impli es that the pCR rate for Group 2 is significantly better.   
 
These calculations assume:  
1. A one -sided z -test based on a pooled estimate of the variance,  
2. An alpha error of 0.10,  
3. 80% power,  
4. A treatment arm assignment fraction of 50%, and  
5. An alpha spending function based on the O’Brien -Fleming boundary.   
 
The pCR rate of Group 1  is assumed to be 18% and the trial is powered to detect an 
improvement of the 15 percentage points for the pCR rate (i.e.,  a pCR rate of 33% for Group 2 ).  
We expect accrual to be approximately [ADDRESS_927902] conservation su rgery will be estimated for each group and a 95% confidence interval 
for the rate of breast conservation surgery for each group will be reported.   
 We expect accrual to be approximately [ADDRESS_927903] conservation surgery will be estimated for each group 
and a 95% confidence interval for the rate of breast conservation surgery for each group will be 
reported.  
Death occurring prior to surgery is considered a treatment failure.

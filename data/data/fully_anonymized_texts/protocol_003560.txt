2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Disease : AML  and MDS  
2.1.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia  
Acute myeloid leukemia is predominantly a disease of the older adults with a median age  of 
diagnosis of 67 years  [1]. Standard induction chemothe rapy for acute myeloid leukemia consists of 
cytarabine plus an anthracycline. Predictors of adverse prognosis with this treatment include age 
> 60 years, poor risk karyotype abnormalities, poor performance status, and secondary AML [2]. 
Treatment with a supportive care strategy alone results in median survival  on the order of several 
weeks [3]. Standard induction chemotherapy in older adults results in subop timal outcomes, with 
complete response (CR) rates of 40% and a median survival of 1 year [4]. For older patients with 
poor risk cytogenetics  and AML secondary t o an antece dent hematologic malignancy, complete 
response (CR) rates are in the 20 -30% range, and most patients relapse within [ADDRESS_61746] a po or prognosis with reinduction therapy [5]. For these reasons, there is currently no standard 
of care for treatment in this patient population, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guidelines list clinical trials as a first -line option for almost all AML patients over the age 
of 60 (NCCN guidelines for AML).  Therapy option s include traditional induction chemotherapy, 
supportive care with transfusions and growth factor support as tolerated, low dose cytarabine, 
hypomethylat ing agents  (HMA)  with the azanucleosides  (azacitadine or d ecitabine ), and use of 
lenalidomide .

28 February  2017  Page 7 of 55 Confidential  2.1.2 Symptomatic Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
The risk of MDS increases with increasing age. The median age in most series is >/= 65 years. 
Risks of progressive MDS include bone marrow failure and progression to AML. Current treatment 
strategies include transf usion and growth factor support, as well as treatment with hypomethylation 
therapy (HMA) and lenalidomide in select patients.  
2.1.3 Outcomes of HMA treatment in MDS   
The CALGB 9221 (comparing azacitidine versus best supportive care) and AZA -001 (comparing  
azacitidine to several different types of conventional care) studies helped establish HMA therapy as 
the first line standard of care for most patients with higher risk MDS [6-8]. In the CALGB 9221 
study, 191 patients with a median age of 68 with MDS were randomized to azacitidine (AZA) 
versus best supportive care. The response rate was 60% in the azacitidine group (CR 7%, PR 16%, 
improvement 37%) vs 5% in the be st supportive care group; there was a trend towards improved 
median overall survival in the AZA arm, however it was non -significant (20 months vs 14 months, 
p=0.10; including significant 53% c ross-over; [6]). In the AZA -001 trial, randomizing 358 patients 
with higher risk MDS to azacitidine vs conventional care arm (either best supportive care or low 
dose cytarabine or intensive treatment; no cross -over allowed),  median overall survival was 
prolonged in the azacitidine group (24.5 mo vs 15 mo, p=0 .0001) [7]. Of note, in patients who are 
not transplant eligible, it is uncer tain whether HMAs are superior to intensive chemotherapy (in the 
AZA -001 trial, the cohorts comparing intensive chemotherapy vs AZ A were small) [7, 9]. Patients 
with higher risk MDS who have failed hypomethylation therapy or have progression to AML on 
HMA therapy, have limited therapeutic options  (see below  for further discussion ). 
2.1.4 Outcomes of HMA treatment in AML  
In the original AZA -001 trial [7] 113 study patients originally classified as MDS were reclassified 
as AML based on the WHO classification from 2008. In a s econd analysis of these patients, there 
was no significant difference in the CR rate between the AZA versus conventional care arm; 
however there was a significant difference in the median overall survival of 24.5 months versus 16 
months (HR=0.47, p=0.005; [10]). However it is important to remember  this analysis  involves only 
patients with a low blast count AML. In a phase II study of decitabine in older patients wit h 
untreated AML (who were not candidates for or refused intensive chemotherapy), the response rate 
was 64% (CR+CRi) with a median overall survival o f 55 weeks [11]. For newly diagnosed AML, 
the decision to proceed with either intensive chemotherapy or HMA therapy first line is often at 
physician -patient discretion after discussion of the two options.      
2.1.[ADDRESS_61747] responders to HMA therapy progress within 2 years (secondary HMA treatment 
failure) and a significant portion of patients have no response with initial HMA therapy ( primary 
HMA treatment failure ). There are no consistent markers at th is time to prospectively predict who 
will fail primary HMA therapy. Several recent retrospective reviews have evaluated the outcome of 
patients who fail HMA therapy. In a retrospective review of the outcome of 74 patients with 
secondary AML (arising from M DS) after azacitidine failure, the median overall survival was found 
to be only 3.4 months with a one year sur vival of 8% [12]. In another retrospective review [13] the 
outcome of 435 patients with high risk MDS/RAEB -T post azacitidine failure was evaluated. 
Median overall survival was only 5.6 months and 2 year survival p robability was 15%. In  another 
retrospective review [14], evaluating the outcome of 87 patients with MDS and CMML with failure 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  CPX -351 for AML and higher ris k MDS who failed prior therapy with HMA  
28 February  2017  Page 8 of 55 Confidential  to decitabine (defined as primary failure, loss of response, or progression to AML), a similarly poor 
outcome was identified with a m edian survival of 4.3 months after decitabine failure with a 12 
month survival rate of 28%. Of the 87 patients, 22 patients had evolved to AML at the time of 
decitabine failure and 65 patients remained with MDS. Of the patients with AML, 10 received 
chemot herapy with Idarubicin and Cytarabine (IA), with 2 achieving CR and one patient achieving 
a bone marrow CR. Of the 65 patients with MDS, 10 received IA chemotherapy with 2 patients 
obtaining a bone marrow CR; 30 patients received investigational agents; 2 patients of 4 undergoing 
an allogeneic stem cell transplant achieved a sustained CR >/= 24 months. Thus these results reveal 
the following:  
1) patients with higher risk MDS and AML who fail HMA therapy have very poor outcomes, 
after both primary and secondar y failure;  
2) new treatment strategies  are needed  in patients with higher risk MDS and AML who have 
failed HMA therapy; there are no standard treatment options in this patient population;  
3) patients who have failed prior HMA therapy can still respond to intens ive chemotherapy, 
though with sub -optimal outcomes with current intensive chemother apy.    
2.2. Study Agent Summary  
CPX -351 is a liposomal formulation of a fixed molar ratio of 5:1 of cytarabine:daunorubicin. The 2 
drugs are present inside each liposome. T he liposome membrane is composed of 
distea roylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol in a 7:2:[ADDRESS_61748] in 50 mL glass, single -use vials. Sterilization  is done via  filtration through a 
0.22 um filter. Vials are stored at 5 degrees +/ - 3 degrees Celsius. Each vial after initial 
reconstitution with 20 ml sterile water contains 100 uni ts of CPX -351 (5 units per mL ; 100 units per 
vial). Each unit contains 1.0 mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin base i n liposomes . After 
dilution in either normal saline or dextrose injection  to a fina l concentration of 0.10 units/ml to 1.32 
units/ml , CPX -351 is infused over 90 minutes intravenously  through either a peripheral or central 
venous access .  
Cytarabine is a traditional anti -metabolite chemotherapy agent thought to work by [CONTACT_56612] (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). It may also 
inhibit alpha -DNA polymerase and inhibit DNA repair through effects on beta -DNA polymerase.  
Daunorubicin is a traditional chemotherapy agent of the anthracycline family thought to cause DNA 
damage via affecting topoisomerase II, leading to changes in DNA coiling/uncoiling and 
ligation/religation, ultimately affecting DNA and RNA synthesis. Anthracyclines may also cause 
reactive oxygen species generation.      
CPX -351 was developed as a more efficacious drug compared to the free drug combination of 
cytarabine and daunorubicin.  The proposed mechanism for increased efficacy compared to free 
drug treatment includes the following:  
1. The 5:1 molar ratio of the cytarabine: daunorubicin is synergistic; this combination was found to 
be synergistic in leukemia cell lines and murine models;  
2. The 5:1 ratio was found to be maintained for >24 hours after infusion;   
3. The liposomal formulation provides drug stability compared to free  drug cocktail with CPX -351 
found to be in circulation for >7 days after i nfusion;  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  CPX -351 for AML and higher ris k MDS who failed prior therapy with HMA  
28 February  2017  Page 9 of 55 Confidential  4. CPX -351 accumulates  in the bone marrow;  
5. Preferential uptake of CPX -[ADDRESS_61749] been the proposed mechanism overall by [CONTACT_56613] -351 has an increased rate of leukemic cell clearance compared to traditional induction 
therapy given as free drug.        
In the preclinical studies by [15] various fixed ratio liposomal f ormulations of combined cytarabine 
and daunorubicin were tested in leukem ia cell lines and murine models; the 5:1 
cytarabine:daunorubicin drug ratio ( CPX -351) was the most synergistic. In vivo pharmacokinetics 
in a mouse model were significant for findin gs of a longer elimination half -life with CPX -351, with 
the maintenance of a ratio of cytarabine:daunorubicin of 5:1 -9:1 for over 24 hours whereas free 
drug was noted to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_56578]. The absolute plasma concentrations of 
both drug s were significantly higher with CPX -351 compared to administration of free drug 
cocktail. Fixed drug ratio liposomal formulations ranging from 1:1 to 12:1 were evaluated in a P388 
leukemia mouse model, with findings of the 5:[ADDRESS_61750] therap eutically active with 
findings of increased survival. In the CCRF -CEM human leukemia xenograft model, CPX -351 was 
found to accumulate in the bone marrow, and in particular, the concentration of cytarabine and 
daunorubicin was found to be higher in leukemic  cells compared to normal bone marrow cells.  
Cytarabine is normally metabolized to its active form, cytosine arabinoside triphosphate by 
[CONTACT_56614]. It is inactivated by [CONTACT_56615] , which converts it to a 
non-toxic uracil de rivative (ara -U). Daunorubicin is extensively metabolized in the liver and other 
tissues to daunorubicinol,  which is the major metabolite with antineoplastic activity.  Daunorubicin 
is eliminated by [CONTACT_56616].  In pharmacokinetic ana lysis of preclinical 
mouse, rat, and dog models, following CPX -351 administration, cytarabine: daunorubicin ratios 
were noted to be maintained between 3:1 -10:1 (depending on the model) for [ADDRESS_61751] in man 
initial phase I/II study [16] patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia, or high risk MDS, with a median age of 60.5 (range 25 -78), were treated 
with CPX -351. The identified maximum tolerated dose was 101 units/m2  and responses were seen 
in patients with previously  treated, relapsed AML . Of the total 48 patients in the study  (36 in the 
Phase I; 12 in phase II added ), 43 (89.6%) had AML ([ADDRESS_61752] salvage, 10 
second salvage, 10 >2nd salvage); 10 of these 43  patients obtained a  remission (9 CR, 1 CR with 
incomplete platelet recovery). 5  of the remissions were seen in patients >60 years of age. The 
median duration of remission was 6.9 months . In terms of pharmacokinetic results, the 5:1 molar 
ratio of cytarabine: daunorubicin was maintained for up to 24 hours on days 1 and 5 at all dose 
levels; the mean elimination half -lives of daunorubicin and cytarabine were markedly prolonged 
with CPX -351, compared to expected values with traditional use of these drugs.  
In Study 204, a phase II study in newly diagnosed, older patients with AML age 60 -75, CPX -351 
was randomized to traditional induction 7+3 therapy in a 2:[ADDRESS_61753] risk and high risk AML were included. High risk AML was defined as  having either older 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  CPX -351 for AML and higher ris k MDS who failed prior therapy with HMA  
28 February  2017  Page 10 of 55 Confidential  age (age 70 -75), complex cytogenetics (>/= 3 cytogenetic abnormalities) or secondary AML. The 
response rate was 66.7% in the CPX -351 group compared to 51.2% in  the 7+3 treatment group 
(p=0.0712), with increased responses seen in the CRi group of patients receiving CPX -[ADDRESS_61754] 7+3 treatment.  Kaplan -Meier analysis after a minimum followup of 1 year 
was notable for  non-significant improvement in  event free survival and overall survival in the 
CPX -351 group. Early induction mortality (at Day 30 and 60) trended towards being lower for 
CPX -351 (4.7% vs 14.6%, p=0.053) compared to 7+3. In patients with secondary AML, treatment 
with CPX -351 resulted in reduced 60-day early mortality  (6.1% vs 31.6%)  and a statistically 
significant s urvival advantage ( median OS 12.1 mo vs 6.1 mo; HR = 0.41, p=0.02) in comparison to 
7+3.  
In Study 205, a phase  II trial in patients with AML in first relapse age 18 -65, CPX -351 was 
randomized to induction therapy of investigator choice.  T he response rate was 49.4% in the 
CPX -351 arm versus 40.9% in the salvage control arm, with median OS of 8.[ADDRESS_61755] a significant diffe rence in median OS in the 
unfavorable EPI [INVESTIGATOR_56579] (6.6 months vs 4.2 months, HR 0.55 , p=0.02 ).  
Based on the clinical trials above, the safety profile for CPX -351 appears to be similar to traditional 
7+[ADDRESS_61756] common grade 3 -5 adverse events  (>10%) included febrile neutropenia, 
bacteremia, pneumonia, sepsis, fatigue, and hypokalemia. CPX -[ADDRESS_61757] comparison of CPX -351 vs 7+3 was notable for lower 
mortality in the CPX -351 arm (Study 204: 4.7% vs 14.6%). This suggests that increased clearance 
of disease in t his particular study was an important factor contributing to reduction in early 
mortality risk.  
In terms of drug interactions with CPX -351, there are no drug interaction studies of CPX -351 
specifically. Drug interactions are expected to be similar to thos e expected with cytarabine and 
daunorubicin.    
The current proposed trial will be to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CPX -351 for patients with 
higher risk MDS and AML refractory or relapsed to hypomethylation therapy , a population with an 
un-met need for treatment options . The dosing regimen will be CPX -351: 65 units/m2 /day on Days 
1, 3, 5 d uring induction therapy #1. A second course of induction therapy with CPX -351 at 65 
units/m2/day on Days [ADDRESS_61758] ion #1. Patients 
achieving a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CR or CRi) 
after induction therapy will be eligible to proceed with 2 course s of consolidation therapy with 
CPX -351 at doses of  65 units/m2 /day on Days 1 and 3 during each course of consolidation therapy. 
Patients achieving a CR/CRi will be allowed to proceed with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) should they have a donor and wish to proceed for post remission therapy.  
The maximum tolerated dose for induction therapy from the initial phase I/II trial was found to be 
CPX -351 101 units/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5. In the initial phase I/II trial,  3 of the total 11 remissions 
(CR/CRi)  were noted in lower dose levels:  43 units/m2 (2 patients: 1 with AML a nd 1 with ALL) 
and 76 units/m2 (1 patient with AML) . Our patient population will include patients older than 75 
(whereas the phase II study 204 was limited to age 60 -75) with a combined population of higher 
risk MDS and AML  with age >  [ADDRESS_61759] chosen a lower dose of CPX -351 for indu ction and consolidation therapy, since it will be 
important to ide ntify whether a dose between 43 -75 units/m2 confers benefit without additional 
risk. Additionally given the poor outcome of patients with HMA failure in both AML and MDS, 
there may be inherently different biological features of patients with HMA respo nsive  and HMA 
refractory disease  that may predispose them to have different outcomes to drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
2.[ADDRESS_61760] failed prior HMA  given: 1) it s increased total plasma concentration and 
maintenance of  a synergistic ratio for 24 hours, 2) accumulation in bone marrow and proposed 
preferential uptake in leukemic cells compared to normal bone marrow cells.  
Interestingly, in the subset analysis of pa tients in the phase II trial of CPX -351 (study 204) , the 
response rate (CR/CRi) in secondary AML was an impressive 57.5% in the CPX -351 arm vs 31.6% 
in the 7+3 arm. The 60-day mortality was also reduced in the CPX -351 arm (6.1% versus 31.6%). 
Additionally there was a significant difference in the median overall survival between the two 
groups (12.1 months versus 6.1 months; p=0. 02; HR 0. 41). Thus Celator pharmaceuticals is in the 
process of developi[INVESTIGATOR_56580] -351 further in a  phase III randomized trial of 7+3 v ersus CPX -351 in 
patients with previously untreated secondary AML.  
However there are no trials of CPX -351 in patients with relapsed/refractory  higher risk MDS and 
AML  after prior HMA therapy.  HMA therapy is the standard of care for patients with higher ri sk 
MDS. However if they have primary refractory disease or relapse after prior HMA therapy or 
progress to AML on HMA therapy, there is currently no standard of care  for this group of patients . 
HMA therapy is also now actively being investigated in patients  with AML. For patients with AML 
who fail HMA therapy (primary refractory) or have progressive disease on HMA therapy after 
initial response, there is similarly no current standard of care. Therefore we believe it will be 
important to identify the safety a nd efficacy of CPX -351 in this patient population , which has a very 
poor outcome at p resent.  
Thus , given the encouraging response rate of CPX -351 seen in older patients with AML, including 
secondary AML, and the reasonable 60 day mortality seen in the pri or phase II trial  in older 
patients , we propose an open label phase II study of CPX -351 in older patients (age 60 and older ) 
with higher risk MDS and AML with HMA relapsed or refractory disease.   
2.4 Study Design  
This will be an open label, fixed dose intervention phase II trial of CPX -351 in patients with higher 
risk MDS with HMA refractory/relapse  disease, and patients with AML with failure to prior HMA 
therapy for either AML or MDS.  The primary outcome is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy 
of CPX -351 in this patient population.  
2.4.1   Study treatment  
In this study patients will recei ve CPX -351 for induction course #1  at a dose of 65 units/m2/day on 
days 1, 3 and 5 intra venously, over approximately 90 -minute infusions. The doses of CPX -351 are 
calcu lated using the patient’s actual weight.  
 Patients who have evidence of morphological leukemia free state with <  5% blast count on Day 14 
marrow (+/ -3 days) will be monitored for count recovery, followed by [CONTACT_56617] g a CR/CRi.  Each consolidation therapy course will consist of CPX -351

consolidation course.  
 For patients who have a reduced blast count on the Day 14  marrow (+/ - 3 days) compared to 
baseline but have not yet achieved a morphological leukemia free state ( < 5% blasts) , a second 
course of induction with CPX -351 will be given , at a dose of 65 units/m2/day on Days 1 and 3.  
 Patients who have absolutely no change in the blast count  on the Day 14 marrow (+/ - 3 days)  
compared to baseline will be discontinued from study treatment and followed for survival  
 Patients whose assessm ent of a morphological leukemia free state on the Day 14 (+/ -3 days) marrow 
is equivocal by [CONTACT_56618], will have a repeat bone marrow biopsy done 7+/ -3 days later. If repeat 
marrow shows morphological leukemia free state with < 5% blasts, patients will be monitored for 
count recovery  followed by [CONTACT_56619] a CR/CRi . If repeat marrow 
shows ≥ 5% blasts, patients will undergo a second  induction course with CPX -351 at a dose of 65 
units/m2/day on days 1 and 3.   
 For patients who achieve an initial morphologic leukemia free state after first induction but have 
disease relapse within ( ≤) 15 days (defined by > 5% blasts on bone marrow biopsy or peripheral 
circulating blasts) will be eligible for a second course of induction therapy at PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], if safe to 
administer.   
 Patient s who achieve a CR/CRi after a second course of induction, will receive consolidation 
therapy. Patients who are unable to achieve a CR/CRi after a second course of induction, will be 
discontinued from the study and followed for survival.  
2.4.2   Patient population  
We plan on evaluating CPX -351 in 3 primary populations: (A) patients with higher risk MDS age 
60 and older  who are refractory/relapsed after prior  HMA therapy, (B) patients with AML age 60 
and older  who are refractory/relapsed after prior HMA therapy , (C) Subjects age 60 and older with 
higher  risk MDS who are HMA r elapsed/refractory who have progressed to AML .  
2.[ADDRESS_61762] been used to stratify patients with AML into three main 
risk-categories: favorable, intermediate, and poor risk [2, 17] with risk categorization being relevant 
to both prognosis as well as treatment gu idance in relation to traditional induction and consolidation 
therapy. More recently, molecular characterization of AML has identified significant genotypic and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_56581] . Mutations in FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA have been shown to have 
prognostic and treatment relevance  [18]. Current institutional standard of care includes assessment 
of cytogenetics and molecular analysis. Cytogenetic analysis is also an important component of the 
IPSS prognostic e valuation in patients with MDS [19]. A cancer somatic mutation panel  (also called 
snapshot panel)  is also routinely obtained at Stanford for patients with neoplas ms. Thus as part of 
routine evaluation of patients with AML and MDS, we will review cytogenetic and molecular 
mutational data  as available . We will then compare whether cytogenetic or certain molecular 
mutations are associated with response to CPX -351. The sample size from a genetic perspective, 
may be a limitation of noting an association ; however if possible associations noted, this can be 
pursued further i n the future by [CONTACT_56620] a larger group of patients who have received CPX -351 
and comparing respon ders to non -responders  in prior or future  studies of CPX -351. Given that the 
response rate was higher in Study 204 of CPX -351 in comparison to 7+[ADDRESS_61763] a particularly significant benefit with CPX -351 in Study 204 and is often 
associated with certain adverse risk cytogenetics, we hypothesize that CPX -351 is associated with 
increased response to chemotherapy even in poor risk cytogenetic risk groups.  
We are planning to perform the following corr elative studies:  
a. Whether molecular mutations are associated with response to CPX -351 using molecular 
mutational data as available.  
b. Whether cytogenetic abnormalities (obtained by [CONTACT_56621]) are 
associated with response to CPX -351, using cytogenetic data as available

4. TREATMENT PLAN  
This will be an open label, fixed dose intervention phase II trial of CPX -351 in patients with HMA 
refractory/relapsed higher risk MDS  (age ≥ 60), AML with HMA refractory/relapse disease  (age 
≥ 60), and MDS that is refractory/relaps ed after HMA  treatment for MDS  that has transformed to 
AML (age ≥ 60). The primary outcome is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of CPX -351 in 
this patient population. Study enrollment  duration is expected to be approximately 24 months. 
During the tr eatment phase of this study, patients will receive up to two courses of induction 
followed by [CONTACT_56624], with monitoring for safety (early deaths, advers e 
events) and efficacy measures .     
4.[ADDRESS_61767] within 28 
days of initiation of therapy.  
Initial Evaluation  
 At screening  subjects  will have a general history , vitals, physical exam  and ECOG status 
noted  
 Laboratories that are routine for patients with MDS and AML will be completed including 
CBC with diff, CMP  [which is BMP+LFT] within 14 days of treatment initiation .  
 A baseline CXR  [or CT chest]  and Urinalysis wi ll also be performed within 14 days of 
treatment initiation , which is routine for patients with MDS and AML in consideration for 
intensive chemotherapy  
 Routine cardiology evaluation is performed for all AML and MDS patients in consideration 
for intensive c hemotherapy. An EKG and ECHO  (or MUGA)  will be done as part of this 
routine care within 28 days of treatment initiation  
 Bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_56584], is routinely performed for 
patients presenting to Stanford hematology for AML and MDS for disease assessment. 
IRB-[ADDRESS_61768] of care. Bone marr ow evaluation is to be done within 21 days 
of treatment initiation. Note: patients may be treated prior to return of full results of 
molecular and cytogenetic analysis. If there is a dilute or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_56585], or insufficient 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_56586], bone ma rrow biopsy can be allowed to estimate blast count and 
cytogenetics ; of note in these situations, there may be insufficient material to obtain full 
cytogenetic analysis.  Bone marrow biopsy and/or peripheral blood can be used to obtain 
molecular mutational analysis (if there are blasts in peripheral blood) . If there is insufficient 
material for cytogenetics or molecular analysis, this can be noted.  
CPX -351 Administration  
CPX -351 is administered through a peripheral or central venous access, over approximate ly 
90-minute infusions. The doses of CPX -351 are calculated using the patient’s actual weight. Both 
inpatient and outpatient administration of CPX -[ADDRESS_61769] Induction:

28 February  2017  Page 19 of 55 Confidential  version. The trial may be stopped early for the following reasons:  
- Unacceptable toxicity  
- Discontinued drug development  
- Poor enrollment  
- Request from regulatory authority  
In case of study discon tinuation, all study participants will be informed.  
4.4  Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients will be discontinued from the study under the following circumstances:  
- Completion of protocol  
- Persistent disease with a lack of any response to treatment  
- Persistent disease without achievement of CR/CRi despi[INVESTIGATOR_56589] -351 
- Relapsed disease: presence of > 5% blasts in the bone marrow following  CR or CRi  (note 
however patients who achieve morphologic leukemia free state after first induc tion but have 
disease relapse within ( ≤) 15 days will be eligible for a second course of induction)   
- Patient  non-adherence with protocol  
- Administration of non -protocol consolidation or non -protocol salvage therapy   
- Inter-current illness which in the judgme nt of the investigator affects assessment of clinical 
status to a significant degree, and requires discontinuation of protocol therapy  for patient safety  
- Withdrawal of informed consent by [CONTACT_56627]. The patient will be 
classified as  withdrawal of consent.  
4.[ADDRESS_61781] decreased the induction and consolidation dose in our study compared to prio r phase II studies 
of CPX -351, as our patient population includes patients > [ADDRESS_61782] had prior lifetime daunorubicin exposure >  368 mg/m2 
or equivalent other anthracycline dose. We are also excluding patients with uncontrolled current 
myocardial impairment.  Given the partial hepatic metabolism of both daunorubicin and cytarabine, 
patients with active hyperbilirubinemia or active transaminitis will be excluded. An exception is 
however patients who have active hyperbilirubinemia or transami nitis secondary to leukemia, in 
which case, treatment of leukemia may improve liver dysfunction. Similarly patients with 
significant renal dysfunction will be excluded. An exception is in patients with renal dysfunction 
secondary to leukemia (example tumor  lysis or hyperleukocytosis), in whom treatment of leukemia 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  CPX -351 for AML and higher ris k MDS who failed prior therapy with HMA  
28 February  2017  Page 20 of 55 Confidential  may improve renal dysfunction.  High dose cytarabine therapy ( ≥ 1.5 grams / m2 or 1500 mg/m2) has 
risks of neurotoxicity. The dose of cytarabine as part of CPX -[ADDRESS_61783] guidelines for therapy for patients with AML and MDS who are 
relapse d/refrac tory to HMA therapy. Therefore the alternatives to this clinical study include patient s 
not participating. Patients may opt for no treatment, best supportive care (transfusions, treatment of 
infections etc.), hydroxyurea (a general myelosuppressive agent f or palliative care), low dose 
subcutaneous cytarabine, another clinical trial that they are eligible for, or other alternatives after 
discussion with their treating physician.  
5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT/DEVICE/PROCEDURE INFORMATION  
5.1  Investigational Agen t/Device/Procedure  
Please refer to the investigator’s brochure provided by [CONTACT_56628]. We will 
review and summarize the investigational agent here.    
5.1.1   Introduction  
CPX -351 is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of cytarabine  and daunorubicin in a 5:[ADDRESS_61784] shown that maintaining this fixed molar ratio 
maximizes antitumor efficacy in cell lines and animal models compared to conventional free drug 
treatment. The rationale for use i n patients with AML and higher risk MDS, is that delivery of a 
fixed, maintained ratio of 5:1 of cytarabine: daunorubicin will enhance efficacy compared to 
treatment with conventional free drugs in the 7+3 regimen.  
5.1.2   Dosage Form, Route of Administrat ion, and Dosage Regimen  
CPX -351 is a liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin in a fixed molar ratio of 5:1, 
contained within the liposome. The liposomal membrane is composed of 
distearylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), distearylphosphatidylglycerol  (DSPG) and cholesterol in a 
7:2:1 molar ratio. A copper based loading process is used to encapsulate daunorubicin. The size of 
these liposomes is approximately 100 nm and the drug is filtered through a 0.22 micromolar filter 
for sterilization. One unit of  CPX -351 contains 1.0 mg cytarabine (+/ - 10%) plus 0.44 mg 
daunorubicin (+/ -10%).  
CPX -351 is provided by [CONTACT_56629] a sterile, pyrogen free, pur ple lyophilized 
formulation in 50 mL glass, single use vials. Each vial contains 100 units of CPX-351. The 
lyophilized cake is reconstituted with sterile water for injection to obtain a homogen ous dispersion  
at 5 units/mL  (ex. 20 mL sterile water with 100 units of drug, with final concentration 5 units per 
mL). After dilution in either normal saline  or dextrose injection to a final concentration of 0.10 
units/ml to 1.32 units/ml, CPX -351 is infused over 90 minutes intravenously. CPX -351 will be 
administered through peripheral or central venous access , using an infusion pump or other means to 
ensure d rug administered over appropriate time period.  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  CPX -351 for AML and higher ris k MDS who failed prior therapy with HMA  
28 February  2017  Page 21 of 55 Confidential  The dosing regimen for induction course  #1 will be CPX -351 65 units/m2/day on Days 1, 3, and 5. , 
with CPX -351 65 units/m2/day on Days 1 and 3 for induction course #2 for patients requiring a 
second course of induction. The dosing regimen for consolidation courses will be 65 units/m2/day 
on Days 1 and 3.

(image from CPX -351 Investigator’s Brochure provided by [CONTACT_56630])  
 
5.1.3   Drug Preparation , Storage , and Stability  
The appropriate number of vials of CPX -351 based on patient’s body surface area (BSA) should be 
removed from the refrigerator and reconstituted with sterile water to obtain a homogenous 
dispersion of 5 units/mL, before further dilut ion. Further dilution can be completed with either 
sodium chloride or dextrose injecti on. CPX -351 can be diluted to a final concentration between 0.10 
to 1.32 units/mL  prior to administration . CPX -[ADDRESS_61785] astic agents.    
CPX -351 liposome injection cartons should be stored refrigerated at 5 degrees Celsius +/ - [ADDRESS_61786] attributes. The current shelf -life of CPX -351 is 24 months from the date of 
manufacture. Drug that fails to comply with specifications will be removed.  
5.1.4 Proposed Mechanis m of action  of Cytarabine , an active component of CPX -351 
Cytarabine (or cytosine arabinoside) is a traditional anti -metabolite chemotherapy agent used for a 
variety of leukemias and non -Hodgkin’s lymphomas. It is thought to work by [CONTACT_56631] -neoplastic activity , by [CONTACT_56632][INVESTIGATOR_56590] . Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into an active triphosphate 
form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). This metabolite is ab le to become incorporated into DNA , 
and may inhibit alpha -DNA polymerase and inhibit DNA repair through effects on beta -DNA 
polymerase.  
IRB-[ADDRESS_61787] cancer. Anthracyclines are thought to cause 
DNA d amage by [CONTACT_56633], leading to changes in DNA coiling/ uncoiling, 
ligation/religation [20] ultimately affecting DNA and RNA synthesis. Anthracyclines may also 
cause reac tive oxygen species generation.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_61788] in developi[INVESTIGATOR_56591] .  
In the preclinical stud ies [15] various fixed ratio liposomal formulations of combined cytarabine 
and daunorubicin were tested in leukemia cell lines and murine models. In vitro  cytotoxicity curves 
from various tumor cell lines analyzed for synergy showed that the 5: 1 cytarabine:daunorubicin 
drug ratio ( CPX -351) was the most synergistic (53% synergy, 33% antagonism, 13% additive).  In 
vivo pharmacokinetics in a mouse model comparing free drug cocktail versus CPX -351, were 
significant for findin gs of a longer eliminatio n half -life with CPX -351, with the maintenance of a 
ratio of cytarabine:daunorubicin of 5:1 -9:[ADDRESS_61789] higher drug 
concentrations when CPX -351 was used, in comparison to free drug combination. Finally, fi xed 
drug ratio liposomal formulations ranging from 1:1 to 12:1 were evaluated in a P388 leukemia 
mouse model, with findings of the 5:[ADDRESS_61790] therapeutically active with findings of  
increased survival.   
Thus the proposed mechanism of action  for improved efficacy of CPX -351 compared to 
conventional free drug administration o f cytarabine and daunorubicin includes:  1) the maintenance 
of a synergistic 5:1 molar ratio for periods > 24 hours after infusion because of the encapsulation of 
the drugs ; 2) the drug liposome has also been found to be stable an d able to circulate for more tha n 
7 days after drug infusion; 3) a n additional mechanism may be the accumulation of CPX -351 in the 
bone marrow, as shown in mouse models, and 4) the preferential upta ke of CPX -351 within 
cytoplasm of leuk emic cells [15].

Summary of CPX -351 in Animal  Studies   
In the P388 leukemia model,  mice who received CPX -351 (5:1 ratio of cytarabine: daunorubicin) 
had a hig her survival at Day 55 compared to mice who received other ratios (1:1, 3:1, 12:1). 
CPX -[ADDRESS_61791] additionally been done in rat a nd dog toxicokinetic 
studies, showing 3:1 – 7:1 ratio maintenance for 24 hours following administration. Total plasma 
drug concentrations were higher for extended time periods with CPX -351 compared to free drug 
administration.    
In the bone marrow engraft ing CCRF -CEM human leukemia xenograft model, CPX -351 was found 
to deliver higher amounts of cytarabine and daunorubicin compared to free drug cocktails. 
Prolonged drug exposure with maintenance near the 5:[ADDRESS_61792] liposomes in leukemic cells.       
Of note, toxicology studies were completed using single dose and repeated dose administrations of 
CPX -351 in the Beagle dog and Sprague -Dawley rat models. T hese studies helped to identify the 
starting dose of CPX -351 at 3 units/m2 for the subsequent Phase I dose escalation study in humans.  
Summary of CPX -[ADDRESS_61793] completed accrual. A co mplete 
analysis has been publi shed for the initial phase I trial [16] and accrual has been completed for two 
phase II trials, with ongoing followup. Data availab le for these trials is summarized here with 
additional information available in the investigator’s brochure.  
Phase I Study of CPX -351: CLTR0305 -101 
In this initial phase I study, the primary goal was to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
for CPX -351 for recommendations on dosing for further phase II studies.  
Pharmacokinetic  assessments of plasma samples were made at every dose level and patients were 
monitored for signs of antileukemic activity.  An induction course with CPX -351 administered on 
days 1, 3, and 5 over 90 minute infusions was designed to mimic the 7 day drug exposure with 
conventional 7+3 treatment. Patients with relapsed/refractory AML, ALL, and high risk MDS were 
eligible for the study. There were 43 pts with AML, 3 pts with ALL, and  2 pts with MDS who were 
treated. The median age of patients was 62 with an age range of 23 -81. The starting dose of 
CPX -351 was 3 units/m2, and studied dose levels were 3 (1 patient),6 (1 patient),12 (2 patients), 24 
(4 patients), 32 (4 patients), 43 (4 p atients), 57 (3 patients),76 (3 patients),101  (6 patients), and 134 
units/m2 (6 patients).  There were 34 patients who were studied in the do se escalation part of the 
study.  
Dose limiting toxicities were observed at the 10th dose level of  134 u/m2  (3 DLTs in 3 patients of 
6), including congestive heart failure (CHF; 1 pt), hypertensive crises (1 pt) and persistent cytopenia 
past 56 days (1 patient ; recovery occurred at day 112 ). The patient with the CHF epi[INVESTIGATOR_56592] 
369 mg/m2 daunorubicin and a total o f 556 mg/m2 including CPX -351, and as a result, phase II 
studies have included a cap of 500 mg/m2 on cumulative anthracycline dose after one induction 
course of CPX -351 and patients with significant pre -existing cardiac disease were excluded. Thus 
101 unit s/m2 was found to be the MTD. An additional 14 patients were subsequently added to the 
101 units/m2 cohort during the expansion phase of the study to obtain additional safety and 
potential efficacy data, for a total of 48 patients . Grade 3 and 4 Non -hemato logic toxicities included 
mucositis (1 pt), vomiting (1 pt), skin rash (3 pts), CHF (2 pts), elevated bilirubin (1 pt), and 
elevated transaminases (2 pts).  In terms of initial efficacy data, of the total 48 patients, there were

AML with CR had prior cytarbine + anthracycline therapy, confirming anti -leukemic activity. Of 
the total patients with CR, 5 pts were ≥ age 60. The median duration of remission was 6.[ADDRESS_61794] order elimination with minimal early phase distribution.

conventional free drug; and measurable drug levels of cytarabine and daunorubicin were detected 
> [ADDRESS_61796] dose with CPX -351.   
Phase II Study of CPX -351: CLTR0308 -204 
Study 204 is a randomized, open label, multi -center phase II  trial comparing CPX -351 to 
conventional 7+3 in older patients ages 60 -75 with newly diagnosed AML  (including both de novo 
AML and secondary AML) .  One hundred  twenty -seven patients were randomized 2:1 to CPX -351 
or 7+3. 126 patients were treated, 85 on CPX-351 and 41 on 7+3. The primary endpoint was rate of 
response ( CR+CRi ). Success was defined as achievement of a trend towards superior efficacy  with 
a one sided p value of < 0.1 with approximately 80% power.   Secondary endpoints were overall 
survival, eve nt-free survival, CR+CRi duration, leukemia -free after induction, safety and 
practicality of CPX -351 as consolidation therapy and the r esponse rate of CPX -351 between de 
novo and secondary AML. At entry patients were stratified by [CONTACT_654] 60 -69 vs. age 70-75, 
cytogenetics < 3 or ≥ 3 cytogenetic abnormalities , and type of AML, de novo vs. secondary.  High 
risk patients were ≥ [ADDRESS_61797] 
risk patients were age 60 -69 and had non-complex cytogenetics (< 3 abnormalities ) and had  de novo 
AML. After accrual was complete, [CONTACT_56654] from the Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, 
reviewed all of the cytogenetic reports and made the final cytogenetic group determination.  
Randomization and stratificati on were successful in balancing demographic and leukemia 
associated risk factors between the two study arms.  
CPX -351 produced superior rates of  leukemic -free state and response , with similar duration of  
remission. T he improvement in respons e occurred predom inately in the form of CRi (CR with 
incomplete hematologic recovery ). The  study met the primary endpoint with a response rate 
(CR+Cri) of 66.7 % compared to 51.2% with a p -value of 0.0712  (single sided, p  < 0.1). Further 
analysis of response demonstrated con sistent benefit for  CPX -351 in response rate across every  
patient  subgroup , including stratifications based on age, cytogenetic group, and presence of 
secondary leukemia . Kaplan -Meier (K-M) analysis after a minimum follow up of 1 -year 
demonstrated non -significant improvem ents for CPX -351 for Event Free Survival (EFS) and 
Overall Survival (OS) in the overall population and the high risk strata.  Overall survival and EFS in 
the secondary AML group did reach statistical significance favoring the CPX -351 arm (p= 0.01, HR 
0.40; and p=0.04, HR 0.51 respectively). Of the 33 patients in the CPX -351 arm who had secondary 
AML, 13/33 (39%) had prior HMA exposure and 16/33 (48%) had not. There were 19 patients in 
the 7+3 arm with secondary AML; 7 of them had prior HMA exp osure. The response rate in 
patients receiving CPX -351 who had secondary AML and prior HMA exposure was 54% (7/13 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  CPX -351 for AML and higher ris k MDS who failed prior therapy with HMA  
28 February  2017  Page 25 of 55 Confidential  responded with CR/CRi); in contrast, the response rate in patients receiving 7+3 who had secondary 
AML and prior HMA exposure was 29% (2/7 res ponded with CR/CRi).   
Induction mortality was assessed at Day 30 and 60. A trend towards a lower rate of early mortality 
was observed for CPX -351 treated patients at 60 days (4/85, 4.7 % vs. 6/41, 14.6 %, p=0.053 ), 
evidence that CPX -[ADDRESS_61798] in reducing the early death rate. CPX -351 treatment was associated with greater 
myelosuppression and mo re prolonged cytopenias, with a higher  frequency of febrile neutropenia 
(63.5% vs. 51.2 %), bacteremia (35.3% vs.19.5%) , fungal infections (15.4% vs 0%), and bleeding 
events , compared to 7+3. There were 4 deaths in the total CPX -351 group (1 from pneumonia, 3 
from bleeding events; 1 fall in a thrombocytopenic patient; 1 intracranial hemorrhage;  [ADDRESS_61799] hemorrhage). Thus a low threshold for platelet transfusions for critical thrombocytopenia is 
recommended. However the lower mortality rate of CPX -[ADDRESS_61800] , comparing CPX -351 vs 
7+3 in secondary AML  age 60 -75.  
Phase II Study of CPX -351: CLTR0308 -205 
Study 205 is a randomized, open label phase II  trial comparing  CPX -351 (100 units/m2 given on  
Day 1, 3, 5 ) with intensive salvage therapy in patients adult patients < [ADDRESS_61801] relapse . The trial accrued 125 patients with a 2:1 randomization to CPX -351 to CPX -351 
versus investi gator’s choice of salvage therapy. The primary endpoint was survival  at one year . 
Secondary  endpoints were CR+CRi rate, remission duration, event -free survival and 30/60/90 day  
mortality. CPX -351 was able to increase the rate  of CR +CRi rate 49% vs. 41% , and had comparable 
60-day mortality 15% vs. 16% . After 1 -year of follow up there were trends favoring CPX -351 for 
event free survival (HR=0.66, p=0.08) and overall survival (HR=0.75, p=0.19) . In the subset 
analysis of patients with unfavorable risk group by [CONTACT_56634] a 
significant i mprovement in overall survival (HR=0.55, p=0.02) . The proportion of  CPX -351 versus 
control treated patients alive at 1 -year was 37% vs. 30% , and the proportion of  unfavorable risk 
patients alive at one  year was 30% vs. 10% . 
In summary, data from  the Phase I and both randomized Phase II studies demonstrate consistent 
high level activity  of CPX -351 in AML, with increases in leukemia -free state and clinical response 
(CR+CRi) compared to conventional therap y.

Adverse Event Addendum 3/3/2015:  
This protocol addendum is to report a recent unexpected severe ad verse event that occurred in a 
patient receiving CPX -351 on the multi -center CLTR0310 -301 trial at another facility. This is a 
phase III company sponsored trial comparing CPX -351 versus 7+3. The patient was reported to 
have demyelinating motor neuropathy ( grade 3) and hypothyroidism (grade 2), which was possibly 
related to CPX -351. The complete study results (in terms of both safety data and efficacy are 
pending). The report of this event provided by [CONTACT_56637] y will be submitted to the IRB and the 
informed  consent form will be updated with this information.   
Effects on Mutagenicity, Carcinogenicity, Impairment of Fertility, Pregnancy, Nursing 
Mothers  
Mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and impairment on fertility with CPX -[ADDRESS_61810] not been conducted. 
Cytarabine  is known to cause extensive chromosomal damage. As reviewed in the investigator’s 
brochure, Daunorubicin has been reported to cause fibrosarcomas, adenocarcinomas, and peritoneal 
sarcomas. Given the mutagenicity of daunorubicin and cytarabine, patients un dergoing treatment 
with CPX -[ADDRESS_61811] -feeding. Men in this study are still at risk of mutagenicity of 
spermatozoa. Therefore all patients will be advised to use a reliable contracepti ve method.   
SUMMARY: Discussion of Adverse Effect Profile of CPX -[ADDRESS_61812] profile of CPX -351 has been found to be comparable to that of 
traditional induction therapy with 7+3 (study 204) and control salvage therapy (study 205). There is 
an increased incidence of febrile neutropenia, bacteremia, and fungal infections with CPX -351, 
which is thought to be consistent with the longer duration of myelosuppression with CPX -[ADDRESS_61813] udy 205 had lower or similar 
60-day mortality compared to the control arms respectively (4.7% vs 14.6% in Study 204; 14.8% vs 
15.9% in Study 205).       
Risk Reduction  
Given the anticipated older patient population in our study cohort of patients with HMA refractory 
or relapsed AML or MDS, with possible risks of prolonged myelosuppression given older age and 
underlying MDS in patients with MDS or AML secondary to MDS, we are dose reducing CPX -351 
in our study to 65 units/m2/day on Days 1, 3, and 5 for  initial  induction therapy.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.0.  Both Serious and Non -Serious Adverse 
Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific Case Report 
Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event (AE) to 
determine whether it is unexpec ted according to the Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or 
Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be 
followed until resolution  to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_61814] be kept with the case report forms.  
Follow -up information is sent to Celator or its designee  as well as the local IRB office  via the 
original Serious Adve rse Event Form, re -stating the date of the original report.  Either a new 
Serious Adverse Event Form is sent (stating that this is a follow -up), or the original one resent (with 
the new information highlighted and a new date provided).  The follow -up shoul d describe whether 
the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the patient continued or 
discontinued study participation.  The form and fax confirmation sheet must be retained.  
7.3.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulator y Agencies and Review Boards  
The need for an expedited report to regulatory authorities will be determined by [CONTACT_429] -Investigator.  All AEs that are serious, unexpected and associated with the use of CPX -351 
will be reported to the Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) by [CONTACT_1034] -Investigator.   
IRB-[ADDRESS_61815] (IRB) per institutional policy.  
7.3.3 Investigator Reporting to the FDA  
Serious  adverse events (SAEs) that are  unlisted/unexpected, and at least possibly associated to the 
drug,  and that have not previously been reported in the Investigators brochure, or reference safety 
information document shou ld be reported promptly by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_56593] (FDA) by [CONTACT_56638].  Fatal or life threatening SAEs that meet the 
criteria for reporting to the FDA must be reported to the FDA within [ADDRESS_61816] be 
reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days after awareness of the event.  A clear description of the 
suspected reaction should be provided along with an asses sment as to whether the event is drug or 
disease related.    
7.3.4 Adverse event updates/IND safety reports  
Celator shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following information:  
 Any AE associated with the use of study drug in this st udy or in other studies that is both 
serious and unexpected.  
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human 
subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
The Investigator shall noti fy his/her IRB/EC promptly of these new serious and unexpected AE(s)

lab/radiology/pathology finding) in a patient administered with a pharmaceutical product and which 
does not necessarily have to have a causal  relationship with this treatment, only temporal 
association. This is inclusive of worsening of pre -existing conditions or any increases in the 
frequency of a pre -existing condition. As previously described in other CPX -351 protocols, there is 
a difference betwe en seriousness and severity that should be clarified:  
- Severe is used to describe the intensity of a specific event; the event itself may of varying 
medical significance  
- Serious relates to patient or event outcome that is associated with the patient’s life or 
functioning  
7.4.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event based on CTCAE v4.0 criteria  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that at any dose:  
- Results in Death  
- Is life threatening  
- Requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] * 
- Results in p ersistent or significant disability or incapacity  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  CPX -351 for AML and higher ris k MDS who failed prior therapy with HMA  
28 February  2017  Page 32 of 55 Confidential  - Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
- Is an important medical even t# 
 
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56595] a serious adverse event if required for complications 
of AML or co -morbid conditions. Hosp italization will be considered SAE if it fulfills the criteria for 
a serious and unexpected adverse event as otherwise described.  
 
*Exceptions to the definition of SAE are myelosuppression and associated complications (Ex. 
uncomplicated febrile neutropeni a, infection, grade 1 -3 bleeding events (with or without platelet 
transfusions)). These are common and expected events in patients with AML and MDS. These 
events will be reported as AEs, not SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56596], investigations, 
and chemotherapy administration are not considered an SAE in this protocol.  
 
# Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Import ant medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56597].  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home  or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new  diagnosis of cancer during the course of a 
treatment should be considered as medically important.  
Non-hematologic SAEs CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_61818] Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring  Committee (DSMC) using the 
study specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by 
[CONTACT_6802], events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the 
IRB using eProtocol within 10 work ing days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for deaths 
or life -threatening experiences.  
AEs that do not meet the requirement for expedited reporting will be reported to the IRB as part of 
the annual renewal of the protocol.  
8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL ST UDIES  
8.1  Laboratory Correlative Studies:  the following studies are completed for patients in the 
study as part of institutional routine care. We will evaluate molecular and cytogenetic data as 
available and compare to response.  
8.2  Collection of Corre lative Studies:  Mutational and cytogenetic evaluation and bone marrow 
biopsy are routin ely clinically obtained on initial evaluation at  Stanford to confirm and evaluate 
current status of disease. These studies may be  evaluated as clinically indicated at the time of 
relapse or progression of disease  depending on diagnosis (AML or MDS) . They will be collected as 
per standard institutional guidelines.

11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the 
study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will b e reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_56642] (SRC).  Any changes made 
to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_31482].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all 
participating investigators  and research coordinators involved in the study . 
11.[ADDRESS_61828] Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the 
monitoring entity for this study. The DSMC will audit study -related activities to determine whether 
the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, 
FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  In ad dition, the DSMC will regularly review 
serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection 
of human subjects.  Results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the 
appropriate regulatory authori ties at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as 
needed.  
11.3 Data Management Plan  
The Protocol Director, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and data pertin ent to the study.  A Unique Study ID will 
be created for each patient to maintain patient confidentiality and the unique study ID will be used 
on case report forms (CRFs). The protocol director and his/her designee will keep the key linking 
patients with t heir unique study ID.  
Study sp ecific CRFs will document treatment outcomes for data analysis.   Data from source 
documents are used to transcribe critical protocol data on CRFs. The REDCAP database system  will 
be used to  assist in data analysis  and will b e maintained by [CONTACT_56643]/her designee . 
For any printed or paper CRFs , they  will be kept in a locked office . Access to electronic study 
databases will be restricted by [CONTACT_56644].

28 February  2017  Page 37 of 55 Confidential  Sample Size Justification  
Using a desired significance of 0.05 (alpha; type I error) and power of 80% (beta 0.20; 
power=1 -beta) with a two sta ge minimax design using p0=0.20 and pA=0.[ADDRESS_61830] 18 
patients, if no more than four out of 18 treated achieve the primary end point of CR/CRi after 2 
induction cycles (i.e. response rate of 22%), then the regimen will be considered ineffective and the 
study will be terminated; if five or more of the 18 patients achieve a CR/CRi, the study will  accrue 
to a minimum total of [ADDRESS_61831]  Size Justification:  
The null hypothesis (p0=0.20) is based on estimated predicted average CR/CRi rate of 20% based 
on several studies.  In the retrospective review study by [23] outcomes of 61 patients with 
secondary AML who received traditional types of induction therapy were evaluated; of patients who 
had prior HMA therapy or revlimid, 32% achieved CR/CRi  (compared to those who had induction 
chemotherapy after best supportive care ; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.04 -0.42; p=0.001). The  median OS in 
this patient cohort was 3.[ADDRESS_61832] been treated with 
“acti ve therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]” after AZA failure; of 4 patients who received intensive chemotherapy, non e 
responded [12]. In a study of outcomes of MDS after AZA failure, of 35 pa tients who received 
intensive chemotherapy, there was a 14% overall response  with 8.9 months as the median survival  
([13]; p=0.[ADDRESS_61833] 
supportive care ). Given the wide range above, we estimate that the predicted response to traditional 
induction therapy in this group will be between 15 -20% (lower than 32%) given the older age 
cohort in our stu dy.  
The alternative hypothesis of predicted CR/CRi response with CPX -351 in our study 
patients will be 40% (pA=0.40). In the preliminary Phase IIb data of CPX -351 induction therapy 
versus 7+3 therapy in newly diagnosed AML patients aged 60 -75, the CR rate  was 48.8% and the 
CRi rate was 17.9% with total response rate of 66.7%; patients with secondary AML had CR rate of 
36.4% and CRi 21.2% with total response rate of 57.6%. Amongst the patients with secondary 
AML in the CPX -351 arm (N=33), 13 patients had pr ior hypomethylation therapy exposure and 16 
had not; 4 patients had prior treatment with other agents. In the patients with prior HMA therapy 
receiving CPX -351, the CR rate was 23% (3/13) and CRi rate was 31% (4/13) with overall CR/CRi  
rate of 54% (7/13). We anticipate that the patients enrolled in our study will have an older age  and 
include patients with MDS,  and potentially lower CR/CRi rate. Thus our alternative hypothesis will 
conservatively be established at  pA=0.40.

primary end point of CR/CRi after 2 induction cycles (i.e. response rate of 22%),  then the regimen 
will be considered ineffective and the study will be terminated; if five or more of the 18 patients 
achieve a CR/CRi, the study will  accrue to a minimum total of 33  patients.

 All patients who achieve CR will be included in the analysis of remission duration   
12.5.2 Secondary Outcomes:  Analysis Plan  
Analysis of secondary outcome measures will be d one by [CONTACT_3433] e following:  
 The remission of duration will be calculated by [CONTACT_56646] a CR  (and CRi for AML) . 
The average days of remission will be calculated to determine the median duration of 
remission.  
 Induction mortality at Day [ADDRESS_61836] received any

APPENDIX  D: Definitions of De Novo AML and Secondary AML  
 De Novo AML refers to patients with AML with no clinical history of prior myelodysplastic 
syndrome, myeloproliferative disorder, or exposure to potentially leukemogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_56605]  
 Secondary AML refers to patients who have a history of MDS, MPD , or exposure to 
potentially leukemogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_56606]; this includes alkylating agent related 
MDS/AML and topoisomerase II related AML  
 AML : the blast count must be ≥ 20% in either the peripheral blood or bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_56607]. 
Exceptions include  t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17 ) disease , in which case the diagnosis of AML is 
made regardless of blast count

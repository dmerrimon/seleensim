8.0 BACKGROUND 
8.1 Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_841097] (ARDS) 
ARDS is recognized as the most severe form of  acute lung injury (ALI), a form of diffuse 
alveolar injury, which is an acute inflammato ry lung process, associated with increased 
pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight, and loss of aerated lung tissue. The 
acute, intense inflammatory res ponse of the lungs occurs as a result of direct (e.g., toxins, 
infection) or indirect (sepsis, trauma) insult  to the alveolar capi[INVESTIGATOR_841098] ( Ranieri VM et al 2012 , Eworuke et al 2018 ).  ARDS is defined by [CONTACT_2242] 
(within 1 week of clinical insult or onset of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] ); radiographic changes 
(bilateral opacities not fully explained by [CONTACT_190371], consolidation, or atelectasis); origin of edema (not fully explained by [CONTACT_841136]); and severity based on the 
PaO
2/FiO 2 ratio on 5 cm of continuous positive airw ay pressure (CPAP). The 3 categories are 
mild (PaO 2/FiO 2 200-300), moderate (PaO 2/FiO 2 100-200), and severe (PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤100)  
(Ranieri VM, et al 2012 ).  
8.2 MN-166 (ibudilast) 
MN-166 (ibudilast) is a small molecule macropha ge migration inhibito ry factor (MIF) and 
phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4,10-inhibitor drug candidat e with demonstrated neuroprotective action 
in vitro and in vivo. MIF knockout or anti body-neutralization st udies have provided 
neuroprotection validation in certain multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological animal 
models. MN-166 (ibudilast) has a dditionally shown attenuation of g lial cell activation in multiple 
in vitro and in vivo model systems which may represent a novel pharmacotherapeutic approach 
in ALS treatment. 
MN-166 (ibudilast) distributes well to the CN S and is a selective inhibitor of the pro-
inflammatory cytokine, macrophage mi gration inhibitory factor (MIF ( Cho et al 2010 ) and 
certain cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( Gibson et al 2006 ) at clinically relevant plasma or 
CNS concentrations. MIF inhibi tion or knockout has been link ed to attenuated disease 
progression in animal models of multiple sclerosis ( Powell et al 2005 ; Kithcart et al 2010 ) and 
attenuates neuronal death and promotes re covery in mouse spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] ( Nishio et al 2009 ). 
Another MIF knockout study revealed its role in neurodegeneration in an experimental stroke 
model ( Inacio et al 2011 ). PDE inhibition has likewise show n some neuroprotective actions (
Chen et al 2007 ; Nakamizo et al 2003 ).  
MN-166 (ibudilast) has been recogn ized to have glial attenuating ac tivity in vitro and in vivo. In 
activated glia cells in vitro, MN-166 (ibudilast) suppresses the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines and increases the production of anti-in flammatory cytokine a nd various neurotrophic 
factors. ( Suzumura et al 1999 ; Kawanokuchi et al 2004 ; Mizuno et al 2004 ). MN-166 (ibudilast) 
also protects hippocampal neurons ( Tominaga et al 1996 ) and oligodendrocytes against 
excitotoxicity ( Yoshioka et al 1998, 2000 ) and astrocytes against apoptosis ( Takuma et al 2001 ). 
In an animal model of cerebral ischemia, ibud ilast reduces white matter lesions and microglial

 activation ( Wakita et al 2003 ). MN-166 (Ibudilast) was also re ported to reduce glial activation 
and attenuate allodynia in several validated anim al models of peripheral and central neuropathic 
pain ( Ledeboer et al 2007 ; Ellis et al 2014 ).   
In addition, MN-166 (ibudilast) suppresses the e xpression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-
9) (Lee et al 2012 ; Yagi et al 2010 ). MMP-9 potentially plays an  important role in the 
pathogenesis of ALS and when knocked down in animal models, leads to slower progression of 
the disease ( Kaplan et al 2014 ). 
8.[ADDRESS_1168656] dose (50 mg bid; 100 mg/day) are anticipated to be approximately 116 ng/ml (C max) and 
1613 ng*hr/ml (AUC 0-24h) (study AV411-026 HV group ). All of the trials except for Protocol 
Nos. AV411-[ADDRESS_1168657] dosing at 80 or 100 mg /day. While pharmacokinetic drug- drug interactions have not 
been carefully assessed (or are in progress) , there are no clear pharmacologic or safety 
interactions noted to da te. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB) for tabulated 
summaries and details of the findings.   
8.[ADDRESS_1168658] for prevention of ARDS 
The rationale for the use of MN-166for preven tion of ARDS is based upon its cellular and 
molecular target actions and recent research in ARDS animal model ( D Yang, Y Yang, Y Zhao,  
2020 ). At the molecular level, ibudilast inhibits  macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) 
and certain cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines 
such as IL-1-beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha ( Cho et al 2010 ; Gibson et al 2006 ). 
8.5 MIF Inhibition and ARDS 
Macrophage migration inhibitory f actor (MIF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that not only acts on 
macrophages but is also produced by [CONTACT_841137] , exotoxins, and other 
cytokines such as TNF α and interferon-gamma (IFN- γ) (Bach et al 2009 ).  The critical role of 
MIF in mediating inflammatory lung injury in  ARDS has been discussed. The study identified 
enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capi[INVESTIGATOR_841099]. The possibility that MIF up ‐regulates its synthesis in an

murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐ induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant 
TNFα  synthesis in cultured endothelial cells a nd the effect was blocked by [CONTACT_140776] ‐MIF

exposed.  Eight investigator-ini tiated studies are conducted or ongoi ng in US cross-referenced to 
sponsor’s IND. Two trials were conducted in Australia, one study targeted medication overuse 
headache (Australian CTN File No. 2011/012799) and the other targeted chemotherapy-induced-peripheral neuropathy (Australian CTN File No. 2018/010601).  An overview of the safety profile in each of the Phase [ADDRESS_1168666] up 100 mg/d in 
single and multiple doses up to [ADDRESS_1168667] was tested at dosages of 30 or 60 mg/d up to 2 years in the Phase 2 clinical trial (MN-
166-CL-001) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients.  A total of 297 
subjects were randomized; of those, 103 subjec ts were randomized to placebo, 95 subjects were 
randomized to 30 mg/d, and 99 subjects were randomized to 60 mg/d. A total of [ADDRESS_1168668] 30 mg/d or 60 mg/d for up to [ADDRESS_1168669] in this study. 
In the Phase 2 SPRINT-MS/NN102 trial, a total of  [ADDRESS_1168670] up to 100 mg/d and 126 subjects recei ved placebo for up to 96 
weeks. Safety results of study SPRINT-MS/NN102 suggests that the adve rse event profile of 
ibudilast appears to be similar to the pattern of  events seen in the MN -166-CL-001 study at daily 
doses up to 100 mg/day. Most of the adverse events  that appear to be related to ibudilast fall 
under the Gastrointestinal SOC, nausea, vomiting diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia. Other 
treatment-related adverse events included fati gue, hepatic enzymes increased, WBC decreased, 
alanine aminotransferase, headache, decrease d appetite, and insomnia. Although there was a 
higher incidence of depression in the ibudilast group, most of the ev ents were considered to be 
unrelated by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_841101] [ADDRESS_1168671], which was a single event and resolved the next day.

In the Phase 2 open-label study (MN-166-ALS-1202) a total of 35 subjects with ALS received 
100 mg/day up to [ADDRESS_1168674]  at daily doses of up to 100 mg/d  appear to be generally safe 
and well-tolerated. The most commonly reporte d AEs have been nausea, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea, and headaches. There was a slight dose-rel ated increase in the pe rcent of subjects with 
headaches and gastrointestinal AE s. The incidence of nausea s uggested a dose-related increase. 
Ibudilast also appeared to cause  transient changes in laboratory values, particularly AST, ALT 
and GGT which, in most cases, appeared to resolve over time. 
9.[ADDRESS_1168675] 7.5 mg/kg i.p. treatment significantly reduced 
LPS-induced pathological changes and pulmonary  edema in lung tissues. In addition, ibudilast 
treatment attenuated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β  beta, IL-6, TNF, and MCP-1, 
and significantly reduced LPS-induced  cell apoptosis in lung tissues.  
Based on internal data, a 7.5 mg/kg dose of ibudila st administered i.p. resulted in an AUC of 
approximately 862 h*ng/mL, an exposure that is achi eved in healthy volunt eers at doses of 30-[ADDRESS_1168676] was maintained throughout the 36-week duration of the 
study. 
The safety of a single dose of 100 mg has been established in healthy volunteers. In addition, 
long term safety of up to 96 weeks of 100 mg/day  doses has been established in MS and ALS 
patients without any significant safety sequelae. The 100 mg/day is the dose that is shown to 
exert significant reductions in MIF levels, and ther efore considered the ta rgeted clinical dose. 
9.3 Treatment Duration Justification  
According to CDC, among the COVID-19 patients  who developed severe disease, the medium 
time to dyspnea ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] 
(ARDS) ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the me dian time to ICU admission ranged from 10 to 12 
days. According to the published paper discussi ng a total of 191 COVID-19 patients treated in 
Wuhan, China, (Zhou et al 2020 Lancet), the medi an time from illness to dyspnea was 7.0 days, 
median time from illness to onset of ARDS wa s 12 days, and median time from illness to ICU 
admission was 12 days in total patients. The median time from dyspnea to intubation was 10.0 days (IQR 5.0–12.5) for patients who received  invasive mechanical ventilation.

16.0 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Adverse events (serious and non-serious) includi ng all Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) should be collected from time of first dose of study drug until the end of 
their participation in the study (i.e., the subjec t has discontinued or co mpleted the follow-up 
visit). 
MediciNova Inc. 
Protocol MN-166-COVID-19-[ADDRESS_1168702] asse ss the severity and 
relationship to study medi cation for all AEs.  
The PI, sub-investigator (Sub-I) a nd members of the clinical rese arch team are responsible for 
identifying adverse events and reporti ng them to the RN/study coordinator. 
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it m eets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to the Spons or or its designated representative.  
For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_118555]. The Investig ator is required to assess causality and indicate that assessment 
on the CRF. For treatment-emergent AEs with a causal relationship to the investigational 
product, follow-up by [CONTACT_841151] a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Sponsor c oncurs with that assessment.  
16.1 Definition of Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered an 
investigational medicinal product and which does not necessarily ha ve a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be a ny unfavorable and unint ended sign (including a 
clinically significant abnormal la boratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of the investigati onal medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational medicinal product.  Adverse events may include the onset of a new illness and the 
exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.

Page 37  of 44 
 When changes in the severity of an AE occu r more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the event should be noted for that  day. Any change in severity of signs and 
symptoms over a number of days will be cap tured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE, with the amended 
severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change.

medications or chemicals). 
16.[ADDRESS_1168707] from the date the patient 
receives study drug until the end of their pa rticipation in the study, (i.e., the subject has 
discontinued or completed the st udy) through the follow-up visit.  
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_1177], or discovered by [CONTACT_119560], non-leadi ng question such as, 
“How have you been feeling since you were la st asked?” All AEs and any required remedial 
action will be recorded in the subject’s s ource documentation and transcribed onto the 
appropriate CRF page for the st udy period indicated. The nature of  AE, date (and time, if known) 
of AE onset, date (and time, if known) of AE outcome to date, severity, and action taken of the 
AE will be documented together with the PI’s or an authorized physician’s assessment of the

 seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to  study medication and/or study procedure (at the 
time of assessment). 
All AEs should be recorded individually in th e study subject’s own words (verbatim) unless, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_841106] n, the AEs constitute components of a recognized 
condition, disease, or syndrome. In the latter cas e, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be 
named rather than each individual symptom. The AEs will subsequently be coded using the most 
current version of MedDRA. 
16.6 Treatment and Follow-Up of Adverse events (AEs) 
Appropriate measures should be taken to treat AEs as necessary, and the response of the study 
subject should be monitored and recorded. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should 
be obtained as needed, and the results of which should be recorded in the subject’s source 
documentation and transcribed onto the appropriate CRF page. 
All SAEs will be followed until re solution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
16.7 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An AE is considered serious if it meets one or more of the following criteria: 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (i.e., a subjec t is at immediate risk of d eath at the time of the event, 
not an event where occurrence in a more severe form might have caused death) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103296] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is another important medical event (see below) 
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threat ening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medi cal events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency ro om or in a physician’s office, blood dyscrasias 
or seizures that do not resu lt in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. 
Severity is a measure of intensity whereas se riousness is defined by [CONTACT_29967]. For 
example, a mild degree of gastrointestinal bl eeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841107]. Similarly, an AE 
that is severe in intensity is not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed as 
severe in intensity, but would proba bly not be considered an SAE. 
16.[ADDRESS_1168708]’s participa tion in the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_841108] “spontaneously” if considered at least possibly related to study medication. 
Notification of the SAE must be se nt by [CONTACT_6791] (+01 [PHONE_17486]) or email 
([EMAIL_15933]) in the form of  a completed SAE Report to the Sponsor. As a 
minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information: 
• Study number 
• Subject number 
• Gender 
• Date of birth 
• PI’s name [CONTACT_841182] 
• Details of SAE 
• Criterion/criteria for clas sification as “serious” 
• Study medication name, or code if blinded, and treatment start date 
• Date of SAE onset 
• Causality assessment  
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with detaile d descriptions, including clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (e. g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, autopsy 
reports, etc.), with the study subject’s personal identifiers removed. All relevant information 
obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_841109]/or a new SAE Report Form and faxed to the Sponsor  or designee

[ADDRESS_1168710] using a new SAE Report Form, bearing the PI’s signature [CONTACT_3670]. 
Any AE fulfilling the criteria for expedite d reporting will be reported by [CONTACT_841152] I RB/IEC(s) in accordance with the Sponsor’s 
standard operating procedures (SOP ) and local regulatory requirements.

  17.0 GUIDANCE FOR OVERDOSE  
There is no clinical experience  with MN-166 overdose in huma ns and there is no available 
specific antidote (i.e., rescue pr otocol) to the effects of MN-166. Standard symptomatic support 
measures should be used in the case of ex cessive pharmacological effects or overdose.

the study subject during th e initial notifica tion of pregnancy, a separate SAE Report Form should 
also be completed and submitted to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_1168713]’s pregnancy with 
the doctor medically responsible  for the pregnancy. A new Pregnancy Report Form should be 
submitted within [ADDRESS_1168714] becoming aware of any new 
information. 
If additional information on the outcome of the pregnancy and/or the details of the birth/delivery 
is received “spontaneously” by [CONTACT_3452], the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_841112] a 
Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the information. If the outcome of 
the pregnancy is reported as premature birth, or  as elective termination due to a medical reason 
or as spontaneous or accidental miscarriage, the details of the outcome should be described in the 
“Additional Information/Comments” field of the Pregnancy Report Form. The pregnancy 
outcome will generally be reported as a follow-up report.  
An SAE Report Form should be co mpleted if the delivery outcome meets the criteria for a SAE 
(e.g., congenital anomaly/birth defect, stillbirth, some other sickness, etc.). The SAE Report 
Form should be completed with the study subject’s details (e.g., subject numb er, initials, date of 
birth, investigational product in formation, etc.) and the details of the fetal SAE and maternal 
complications should be described in the “Narrative” field of the SAE Report Form. 
If a pregnancy is reported for th e study subject’s partne r, the sponsor will provide instructions on 
how to collect pregnancy information in accordance with local requirements.

 • Have a BMI  (body  mass  index)  at or greater than  40.  
 
Ibudilast has been approved in Japan for over [ADDRESS_1168737] has not been approved by [CONTACT_3133] 
(FDA) for use in the US, Canada and Europe. This means that ibudilast can only be used in 
research studies. So far, this drug has been given to more than [ADDRESS_1168738] nerve pain, and people with multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic latera l sclerosis (ALS) . 
 What should you know before you give consent? 
You are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_589942] (acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]) and  are now 
considering the use of ibudilast because y our doctor believes that ibudilast may help prevent it 
from oc curring.  
Before you consent to receiving treatment with ibudilast, you must be informed of the following: 
• In this study, you will receive standard of care and will have all the standard medications 
and procedures given for your condition. 
• Ibudilast is not  proven to prevent ARDS, therefore, there is no promise that your 
condition will not get worse;  
• You do not have to take this experimental drug and your decision about what to do must be made voluntarily. 
The experimental  drug, Ibudilast, has not received  approval for  use in  humans from  the U.S.  
Food and Drug  Administration  (FDA).  Research  studies to see how safe and how effective  this 
drug treats  diseases have been  conducted and future  clinical  trials  are possible. Your study doctor 
has agreed  to be the Principal Investigator , that is, they accept  the responsibilities  that come  
along with  treating  a patient  with  an experimental drug. These  responsibilities include, but are 
not limited  to, the following:  
• Carrying  out the research  study as described;  
 
• Monitoring you for  safety,  tolerability,  and changes in  your condition, if any, throughout 
the course of  treatment  and post- treatment;   
• Submitting  the necessary  documents to  the FDA,  Institutional Review  Board  (IRB),  and 
the sponsor throughout the  course of treatment  and follow-up.  
 
What will happen to  you during  the study?  
In order to enroll in the study, you will have to review  and sign  this Information and Informed 
Consent Form before having any study -specific procedures to  determine  if you are eligible  to

 The study consists of a Screening  Phase,  a 7-day double- blind  Treatment  Phase and a Follow up 
Phase consisting of Day  14, Day  28 and Day  30 visits . Screening procedures may  be done over a 
3-day period. Study drug will be given  to you twice  a day (at  around breakfast  and dinner time)  
for [ADDRESS_1168739]  a follow-up call  to see how 
you are doing. 
If you are eligible  to participate,  you will be randomized  to one of two  study drug treatments.  
“Study drug” used  in this consent form refers to  both MN-166 and placebo.  Being  randomized  
means that you are put in a group by a chance process,  like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  You  won't  know what  
group you are  in and neither will  your study doctor, study team  or sponsor. You  will have  a 1 out 
of 2 (or 50%) chance of being assigned  to the MN-166 group and 1 out of 2 (or 50%) chance of 
being assigned  to the placebo  group. The placebo  looks like  ibudilast but does not contain  the 
active drug.  Although you and your doctor will  not know which  study drug  you are receivi ng, 
this information  can be determined  in the event  of an  emergency.  
During the study, and after  signi ng the  Information  and Consent form,  the following procedures 
and assessments will  be done. 
Screening  Procedures: 
• Confirm that you are eligible to participate in the study

As a participant  in this study,  you have certain  responsibilities  to help  ensure your safety. 
These responsibilities are  listed  below:  
• Report all side effects and medical problems to the study  personnel; 
• Inform the study doctor or staff if you decide to discontinue your participation 
at which time you will be requested to complete the assessments that were scheduled  on the last day of study treatment.  
What are the risks associated with this study ? 
While participating in this  research study, you are at risk for side effects. Your study doctor will 
discuss these with you. The treatment used in this study may cause all, some, or none of the side effects listed. There also may be other side effects that have not been reported. Ot her drugs may 
be given to manage side effects and make you more comfortable (such as for nausea or headache). Many side effects go away shortly after the treatment is stopped, but in some cases side effects can be serious, or long -lasting.  
The known side effects are:  
Likely   (occurring in more than 20% of people taking the drug)   
• none  
Less Likely (occurring in less than 5% of people taking the drug)  
• appetite loss  
• nausea

 • diarrhea  
• headache  
• rash 
• itching  
Rare but serious (uncommon, between [ADDRESS_1168741] taken MN-166) 
elevated liver enzymes which can be an indication of liver damage.  
Because this treatment is considered investigational and has not received FDA approval, there 
may be other risks that we do not know about at this time.  
 
Risk of Allergic Reaction  
As with any drug, an allergic reaction can occur. Allergic reactions can be mild or serious, which  
can even result in death in some cases. Common symptoms of an allergic reaction are rash, 
itching, skin problems, swelling of the face and throat, or trouble breathing. If you think you are having an allergic reaction or you are having trouble breathing, seek help from medical personnel right away.  
 
Number of Subjects who took Ibudilast  in Prior Clinical Trials  
Approximately 750 people, including nearly 300 with multiple sclerosis (another serious 
neurological disease), 130 with progressive MS and nearly 50 with early ALS (ALS history within 5 years) have been treated with MN-[ADDRESS_1168742] been seen. The side effects that were seen in a 2 -year study were gastrointestinal 
(meaning related to the stomach and intestines), and included nausea and diarrhea, and an increase in liver enzymes.   
MN-166 has been given to nearly 300 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. There 
were 20 serious adverse events (side effects) reported. Most of the serious adverse events were 
gastrointestinal in nature or having to do with bone fractures. All of these serious adverse events 
were considered by [CONTACT_841157]-166. Six of the serious adverse events were considered severe and two were considered life- threatening. Nine subjects 
stopped the study due to a side effect.  Two side effects (liver disorders) were possibly related to taking MN-166. 
MN-166 was given to approximately 130 patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. There 
were 58 serious adverse events (31 in placebo group, 27 in MN-166 group) reported.  Two 
serious adve rse events were considered possibly related to study treatment: thrombocytopenia in 
the placebo group and ataxia in the MN-166 group. 
MN-166 were given to nearly 50 subjects with early ALS patients (ALS history within 5 years). 
A total of 7 serious adverse events were reported in ALS patients. All of the serious adverse 
events were considered to be unlikely or unrelated to study drug by [CONTACT_196997]. Four of these

 serious events were considered severe (dysphagia, ureteral stone, pneumonia and ankle fracture) 
and bowel obstruction was considered life-threatening.  
As noted from the above- mentioned studies, gastrointestinal (GI) distress, which includes nausea 
and diarrhea, appears to be the most common side effect. The GI symptoms associated with MN -
166 tend to occur early (within 1 -2 weeks) and usually last for only a few days or weeks and then 
improve. These symptoms may be relieved with anti -diarrheal or anti -nausea drugs, if necessary. 
Usually, a majority of those receiving MN-166 recover from these symptoms within several days 
(with or without anti-diarrheal drugs). Talk to your study doctor if you experience these symptoms, particularly if they last for more than 2 -3 weeks.  
Other rare side effects associated with MN -166 are cold symptoms, itching sensation, rash, 
dizziness, tremors, insomnia (trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), drowsiness, sudden blushing, anorexia (decreased appetite), abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], flushed appearance, anemia (low red blood cell counts), low white blood cells, tirednes s, facial edema (swelling), 
abnormal sound sensitivity (changes in your hearing) and metallic taste in your mouth.     
Risks associated with blood drawing may include pain, bruising, and infection. Rarely, a person 
will faint.  
Reproductive Risks  
The effect of MN -166 on an embryo or fetus (developi[INVESTIGATOR_191278]), or on a 
breastfeeding infant, is unknown and may be potentially harmful. Because of these unknown risks, if you are capable of giving birth to or fathering a child, you and your sexual partner should use adequate birth control measures while you are in this study. If you are a female who is sexually active and able to become pregnant, or a man with a sexual partner who is able to become pregnant, you must agree to use one or more of the birth control methods listed below. You must use birth control for the entire study and at least [ADDRESS_1168743] dose of study drug. Acceptable birth control methods for this study are:  
• Abstinence (no sex)  
• Oral contraceptives (birth contr ol pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353])  
• IUD (a small T -shaped device containing either copper or a hormone inserted into the 
womb for birth control) 
• Diaphragm with spermicide (a foam, cream or gel that kills sperm)  
• Norplant (birth control capsules that are inserted in the skin of the upper arm of a female)  
• Approved hormone injections 
• Condoms with spermicide 
•  
Women cannot take part in this study if they are: 
• Pregnant 
• Trying to become pregnant

3 STUDY METHODS AND ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel -group study of MN-166 
(ibudilast) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992] -[ADDRESS_1168764] of a Screening Phase followed by a 7- days Double -blind 
Treatment (DBT) and Follow -up Phase. Followi ng the Screening Phase, if the subject meets 
eligibility criteria, subject will be administered treatment with MN -166 (ibudilast) or placebo. 
Subjects will receive ibudilast 100 mg/d (50 mg b.i.d) or placebo every day for 7 days.  The Follow-up phase is consisted of three visits: Day 14, Day 28, and Day 60 (subjects enrolled under amendment 4 only) post- baseline visit.   
Subjects who are discharged prior to Day [ADDRESS_1168765] abnormalities consistent with COVID -19 pneumonia, SpO
2 ≤92% on room air, ≥ 24 BPM, and/or 
requirement of supplemental O 2.   
Overall study design and plan is described in detail in Protocol Section 11.  
3.2 Selection of Study Population 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail in Final Protocol Sections 12.2 and 12.3.

 3.3 Method of Treatment Assignment and Randomization 
During the Double-blind Treatment Phase, randomization occurred in a 1:1 ratio (MN-166: 
Placebo). The randomization scheme was generated by [CONTACT_841169]’s unblinded pharmacist in a password protected file.  
3.4 Treatment Masking (Blinding)  
Participants and all personnel involved with the conduct and interpretation of the study, 
including the investigators, site personnel, and sponsor staff will be blinded to the treatment codes. Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, filed securely by [CONTACT_841170] (e.g., unblinded pharmacist) until the database is locked  
To ensure that treatment allocation remains concealed to both staff and participants, the following measures will be taken: 
• Active drug and placebo will be identical in appearance  
• Drug supplies to investigational pharmacy will be coded  
4  SEQUENCE OF PLANNED ANALYSIS  
4.1 Interim Analysis  
There are no planned interim analyses for this study. 
4.2 Data Monitoring Committee Meetings 
 Not applicable.  
5 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
No prior data are available on which to base assumptions for sample size/power 
considerations. The results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_841125], and the sample size of approximately 40 participants is deemed to be appropriate for this purpose. 
6 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The following analysis populations are planned for the studies: 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects.  
• Safety Analysis Set (SAS) will include all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of study drug and had at least one post- dose safety assessment.  
• Per Protocol Analysis (PP):  will consist of the FAS subjects excluding those with 
major protocol violations.

 • Pharmacokinetic Population (PK): will consist of the subjects for which PK 
collection was performed. Eight subjects are anticipated to participate in PK sample 
collection.  
6.1 Use of analysis populations in different analyses 
Safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety Analysis Set, and participants will be 
analyzed based on the treatment they received. Efficacy analysis will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set, and participants will be analyzed based on the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. 
7 GENERAL ISSUES FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Data from all clinical assessments will be listed and, where appropriate, summarized by 
[CONTACT_841171] . Summary (descriptive) statistics of continuous 
variables include n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum and maximum values at each time -point. For categorical variables, the 
number and percent of counts will be presented.  
7.1 Definition of Treatment Arms  
Treatment arms will be denoted as follows in the TLFs:  
• “MN -166” - 50 mg of MN- 166 administered orally twice daily  
• “Placebo” – Matching Placebo administered orally twice daily  
7.[ADDRESS_1168768] (IMP) and preceding the first dose of IMP (MN -166 or Placebo). 
7.3 Definition of Visit Windows

 Denver Health and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841126]  
7.5 Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
There are two co -primary endpoints. Because study success requires success on both, each 
will be tested using a  one-sided alpha level value of 0.025 (equivalent to a two-sided alpha of 
0.05). All other analyses will be conducted using one-sided tests at the alpha=0.025 level of 
significance, with no adjustment for multiplicity.  
7.6 Planned Subgroup Analyses  
No subgroup analyses are planned in this study. 
7.7 Analysis Software 
All analysis will be performed using SAS® Software version 9.4 or above.  
7.8 Clinical Status Scale  
In this trial, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 8 -point ordinal 
scale is utilized to assess clinical status at Screening, Days 1 -7, and on Days 14, 28, and 60 
(for intubated subjects only). In Section 14.5 of the protocol, the numbers (1- 8) are in reverse, 
where a higher number represents improvement, which is inconsistent wi th the official 
NIAID [ADDRESS_1168770] the official scale shown below.  
1. Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities  
2. Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen

10 EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the Full Analysis Set. All efficacy measurements will be listed.  
10.1 Primary Efficacy Variable Analysis  
The co -primary efficacy endpoints are listed below.   Th e primary analysis for each of these 
two endpoints will be conducted  using Pearson’s chi- square tests. Because study success is 
defined as success on both, each of the two co-primary endpoints will be tested using a one-sided significance level of 0.025.

 10.2 Secondary Efficacy Variable Analysis 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are the following: 
• Proportion of subjects free from  respi[INVESTIGATOR_841123] (invasive mechanical ventilation, non- invasive 
ventilation, high-flow oxygen, or ECMO, CPAP, BiPAP, nasal cannula) at Days14, 
28 and Day 60* Proport ion of subjects with mechanical ventilation /intubation at 
Days 7, 14, 28 and Day 60*  
• Change from baseline in clinical status using NIAID 8-point scale and discharge record at Days 7, 14, 28 and 60* Proportion of subjects with at least a one-point improve ment in clinical status using the NIAID [ADDRESS_1168776] at Day 14,28 and 60*  
• All-cause mortality at Days 28 and Day 60* Proportion of the subjects discharged 
from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41324] 7,14, 28 and 60*  
• Change from baseline in migration inhibitory factor (MIF), (interleukin 1- beta (IL -
1β), interleukin 6 (IL -6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF -α), and C -reactive protein 
(CRP) at Day 3, 5, 7 and 14  
*Intubated subjects only on Study Day 60  
All secondary endpoints that are defined as proportion variables will be analyzed using 
Pearson’s chi -square tests.   Secondary endpoints that are defined as the change from baseline 
will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with treatment group as a factor and the baseline value of the corresponding endpoint as a covariate. All secondary analyses will be conducted using one-sided tests at the alpha=0.025 level of significance, with no adjustments for multiplicity.  
10.3 Exploratory Analysis  
Time to discharge  
10.4 Pharmacokinetics Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed on plasma samples from eight subjects. Blood samples (approximately 2 mL per sample) will be collected at each time point for the bioanalytical assay of MN -166 and stored frozen at approximately - 80°C until shipment is 
sent to the PK vendor. Blood samples will be assayed for MN-166 using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS) method. 
10.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on D ay 1: AM Predose, and at 2, 4, 8 and  
12 hours (Predose of PM dose), and on Day 3 and Day 5 at AM Predose.  
10.4.2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
The following PK parameters will be calculated using model-independent approaches (NCA) 
from MN -166 individual plasma concentrations, whenever practical.

11.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) central coding dictionary, version 25.0. 
The incidence of trea tment-emergent AEs (TEAEs, defined as AEs occurring from the time 
of first dose through [ADDRESS_1168781] dose of MN-166), SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuations will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Incidence of TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_335317] (mild, moderate, or severe), as well as by [CONTACT_72843] 
(not related, possibly related, or probably related) and by [CONTACT_12917]. If it cannot be determined whether the AE is treatment emergent due to a partial onset date then it will be counted as such.  
Summaries that are displayed by [CONTACT_841175].  Summaries of the following types will be pre sented:

 • Subject incidence of TEAEs and total number of unique TEAEs by [CONTACT_99129].   
• Subject incidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_11189], preferred term, and 
highest severity.  At each level of subject summarization, a subject is classified according to the highest severity if the subject reported one or more events.  AEs with missing severity will be considered severe for this summary. 
• Subject incidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_11189], preferred term, and closest  relationship to study drug (Related/Not Related).  At each level of subject 
summarization, a subject is classified according to the closest relationship if the subject reported one or more events.  AEs with a missing relationship will be considered related for this summary. 
• Subject incidence of serious TEAEs and total number of unique serious TEAEs by [CONTACT_14340].   
• Subject incidence of TEAEs leading to study discontinuation or death by [CONTACT_14340].   
As this is a double-blind study, the causality assessment should be made under the 
assumption that the subject is receiving active study medication. If considering unblinding, this assessment should be made prior to unblinding to avoid bias. 
11.1.1 All Adverse Events  
An overview of number of participants (%) with treatment- emergent AEs will be presented 
for the main AE categories (All AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, SAEs, SAEs leading to 
discontinuation, AEs with at least Grade 3 severity (Severe A Es, Life -threatening AEs, 
Deaths), AEs and SAEs with relationship to IMP as possibly related, probably related, or related) by [CONTACT_841176].  
11.1.2 Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal 
A data listing of AEs leading to withdrawal will be provided, displaying details of the event(s) captured on the CRF. 
11.1.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A data listing of SAEs will be provided, displaying details of the event(s) captured on the 
CRF. Serious adverse event narratives will be provided for the CSR by [CONTACT_262177].

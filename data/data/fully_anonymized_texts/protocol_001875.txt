Schedule of Study 
Visits  
 
 Screening Period:  
After obtaining consent and assent (where applicable), screening evaluations will be 
completed at any time during a period of 28  days (Day  -28 through Day  -1) before the 
first dose of the study drug.  
Treatment Period : 
The first dose of the study drug will be administered  on Day 1 and  after randomization.  
Clinic visits will occur on Day  1, Day  15 (± 3 days), and at Day 28 and Day 56 (± 5 days) .  
Safety Follow -up Conta ct: 
A Safety Follow -up Contact  [CONTACT_326878] 28 days (±7 days) after the last dose of 
study drug. The Safety Follow -up Contact [INVESTIGATOR_443875] a telephone interview; however, if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093], a Safety Follow -up Visit may be required with 
necessary assessments to be d etermined by [CONTACT_093].   
  
Assessments  Safety:  AEs, clinical laboratory assessments (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, 
coagulation studies, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations , ophthalmologic 
examinations , pulse oximetry , and post dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (Day 1 only) .

Tolerability:  discontinuation of study drug  

Protocol VX16- 661-[ADDRESS_778275] on the change in ppFEV 1. 
The study will be considered successful if the posterior probability that the treatment 
difference  between TEZ/IVA and placebo is greater than [ADDRESS_778276] 80%, using a 
noninformative prior distribution.  Assuming a 3.0  percentage points mean treatment 
difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo and a  standard deviation  (SD) of 6.0 percentage 
points, with 42 TEZ/IVA subjects and [ADDRESS_778277] 90%  (92.6%) . After adjusting for an assumed 
dropout rate of 5% a total sample size of 90 subjects is needed.  
Analyses Sets  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at 
least [ADDRESS_778278] 1  dose of study drug. The 
Safety Set is to be used for all safety and tolerability analyses , in which subjects will be 
analyzed according to the treatment they received.  
Safety Analyses  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_590529]/IVA is the primary objective of this study and will be assessed 
in terms of AE incidence , including but not limited to the following : 
 Chest discomfort  
 Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_590536] (chest tightness)  
 Asthma  
 Bronchial hyperreactivity  
 Bronchospasm  
 Wheezing  
All safety analyses will be based on the TE Period for subjects in the Safety Set.  
The overall safety profile of study treatments will be assessed in terms of the following 
safety endpoints:  
 Incidence of treat ment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) , SAEs, and 
discontinuations due to AEs  
 Clinical laboratory values  
 Vital signs  
 Pulse oximetry  
All safety data will be listed by [CONTACT_2708].  
Summaries of TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_184768].  
 Efficacy Analysis  
The actual posterior/conditional probability will be calculated for  the probability of a 
greater than zero (>0) treatment effect difference in mean p pFEV 1 change between 
TEZ/IVA and placebo is greater than or equal to 80%, based on the observed data of the 
efficacy endpoint on the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 to the average of the 
Day 28 and Day 56 measurements . This will serve as the primar y efficacy analysis 
outcome.  
Additionally, the key efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 to 
the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements will be analyzed using a mixed -

Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 6 of 56 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with ppFEV 1 at each time point as the 
outcome variable. The MMRM model will include the absolute change fro m baseline in 
ppFEV 1 at each visit as the dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit 
interaction as fixed effects; and subject as a random effec t, with adjustment for sex (male 
versus female), age group at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18  years old), and pp FEV 1 
severity determined during the Screening (or baseline) Period ( <40% versus ≥40 % 
predicted).  
The estimated treatment effect within TEZ/ IVA and placebo arm, as well as the estimated 
treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo arm will be provided based on the 
MMRM model along with 95% confidence interval ( CI). These results will serve as 
additional efficacy outcome s, which is in addit ion to the primary actual 
posterior/conditional probability outcome. Furthermore, treatment effect and treatment 
difference at each post -baseline visit, obtained from the model, will also be provided.  
Secondary endpoints including relative change of ppFEV 1, CFQ -R respi[INVESTIGATOR_590537] a similar fashion as the analysis for the primary endpoint.  
Tolerability Analysis  
A tolerability analysis will be based on the Safety Set for a standard summary of study 
drug discontinuation rate . Rate will be reported as descriptive statistics in percentages and 
no statistical hypothesis testing will be performed.  
IDMC Reviews  The independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct regular planned safety 
reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC Charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  5 INTRODUCTION 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects more than 70,[ADDRESS_778290] in the 
gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an ion channel that 
regulates the flow of chloride and other ions in epi[INVESTIGATOR_489355], including lungs, 
pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Decreased CFTR activity in people 
with CF results in multisystem pathology3, beginning at birth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_590540], the median predicted survival age for a person with CF is 
approximately 40 years.4 More effective treatments are needed for CF. 
To address this medical need, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is developi[INVESTIGATOR_489357]: the defective 
CFTR protein. Two types of CFTR modulators have been developed: potentiators, which 
increase the channel gating activity of the CFTR protein, and correctors, which increase the 
quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators can increase the activity of CFTR protein 
delivered to the cell surface by [CONTACT_489379]: therefore, CFTR potentiators and correctors are 
complementary therapeutic approaches. 
Ivacaftor (IVA; Kalydeco®), the first CFTR modulator developed by [CONTACT_139383], is an orally 
administered CFTR potentiator that increases the channel-open probability of CFTR protein to 
enhance chloride transport. Globally, Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as 
young as [ADDRESS_778291] the G551D  and certain other gating mutations as well as the R117H  
mutation in the CFTR  gene depending on the country.  5 
Lumacaftor (LUM), the second CFTR modulator developed by [CONTACT_139383], is a CFTR-specific 
corrector that increases the delivery of CFTR protein at the cell surface by [CONTACT_590578].  
Orkambi® is a fixed-dose combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_590541]/IVA, which increases the quantity and 
function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. It is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients 
as young as 6 years and older who are homozygous for F508del . 
In clinical trials, LUM/IVA therapy significantly improved lung function and other measures of 
disease and reduced the rate of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF who were 
homozygous for F508del . However, in Phase 1 studies with healthy subjects, there was a decline 
in percent predicted forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (ppFEV 1) observed within 4 hours of 
dosing LUM/IVA. Postdose spi[INVESTIGATOR_590542] P
hase 3 studies with LUM/IVA, but the 
incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (i.e., ch
est discomfort, dyspnea, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_590536]) 
was 22.0% in subjects who received the comm
ercialized dose of the LUM/IVA and 13.8% in 
subjects who received placebo. Post-marketing data for Orkambi suggests that patients have 
discontinued treatment due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521]
y events. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for 
treatment of patients homozygous for F508del  and who have discontinued treatment with 
Orkambi due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_590531].  
Tezacaftor (TEZ) is a CFTR corrector being developed by [CONTACT_590579] 3 studies. Phase 2 data indicate that TEZ in combination with IVA 
(TEZ/IVA) showed statistically significant improvements in lung function (ppFEV 1) in subjects 
with CF who have at least 1 copy
 of F508del after 28 days of treatment. In 

Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 17 of 56 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Studies VX11 -661-101 (Study 101) and VX15-661-103, no trends in respi[INVESTIGATOR_590543] (alone or in combination with IVA). In addition, the 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) for the Phase 3 program has not identified any 
meaningful trends in postdose spi[INVESTIGATOR_590544] (AE) data to suggest that TEZ/IVA is 
associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. Because there is no association of respi[INVESTIGATOR_590545]/IVA, it is reasonable to hypothesize that TEZ/IVA may be a treatment for patients who 
have discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_590546].

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION 
9.1 Study Design 
Study VX16-661-114 (Study 114) is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group, mul
ticenter study in subjects aged 12 years and older with CF who are 
homozygous for F508del  and who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_590554]. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of TEZ/IVA. 
This study includes a Screening Period (up to 28 days), Treatment Period (approximately 
56 days), and Safety Follow-up Period (approximately 28 days). Approximately 90 subjects will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_654] a
t the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) , sex (male versus 
female), and ppFEV 1 (determined during the Screening Visit; <40% versus ≥40% predicted) and 
then randomized 1:1 between the 2 study arms. 
Subjects who complete the Day
 56 Visit will be offered the opportunity to receive TEZ/IVA 
through the Expanded Access Program if they meet eligibility requirements for that program.  
Figure 9-[ADDRESS_778297] dose of study drug. The 
investigator (or an appro
priate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed 
consent/assent from each subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) 
Repetition of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not 
permitted with the following exceptions:  
 If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection o
f a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or assessment 
may be permitted with the approval of the medical monitor. 
Note: Clinical visits are on Days -28, 1, 15, 28, and 56. A telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_106006]  3 collects AEs. The Safety Follow -up 
may be a clinic visit or telephone call.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Exclusionary liver function test (LFT) levels, which may be retested within 14 days of the 
original screening date 
If screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_590555]/ERS guidelines6, repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_94230]. 
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed 
within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreeni ng 
Subjects may only be rescreened with the approval of the medical monitor. If a subject is 
rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated except for CFTR  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was ≥ 40 mIU/mL during prior 
screening), and ophthalmologic examination. If a subject is rescreened, the screening window 
will begin after the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Extension of Screening Period Window 
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 4 weeks for the following 
reasons: 
 Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
 Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria 
 Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (Section 11.4.7)  
 Repetition of spi[INVESTIGATOR_590556] 9.1.[ADDRESS_778298] approximately 56 days. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 
2 treatment arms: TEZ/IVA or placebo. The dosing regimen for each treatment arm is shown in 
Figure 9-1 and is as follows: 
 TEZ/IVA: TEZ 100-mg/ IVA 150-mg fixed-dose combination (light yellow) film-coated 
tablet for oral administration (morning dose); IVA 150-mg (light blue) film-coated tablet for 
oral administration (evening dose) 
 Placebo: 0 mg film-coated matching placebo tablets for oral administration (1 light yellow 
for the morning dose and 1 light blue for the evening dose) 
The first dose of study drug will be administered after randomization on Day 1. Dosing details 
are given in Section 9.5. 
Study visits during the Treatment Period will occur as shown in Table 3-2. Subjects will be 
outpatients during the Treatment Period unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590557]. All visits should occur 
within the windows specified. 
 Safety 
Follow-up Contact 9.1.[ADDRESS_778299] will be performed for the purpose of coll
ecting information on AEs 
28 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety 
Follow-up Contact [CONTACT_590581] 3-2. The Safety Follow-up Contact [INVESTIGATOR_443875] a telephone

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  interview; however, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093], a Safety Follow-up Visit may be 
required with necessary assessments to be determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment may not be required to have a Safety Follow-up 
Contact; refer to Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_778300] prematurely discontinues study treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) 
Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject decides to terminate study 
treatment. These subjects will also be required to complete a Safety Follow-up Contact 28 days 
(± 7 days) after their last dose of study drug.  
If the ETT Visit occ
urs [ADDRESS_778301] withdraws consent for the study, no further visits will be required (including an ETT 
or Safety Follow-up Contact), no further evaluations will be performed, and no additional data 
will be collec
ted. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent. 
 Independent Data Monitoring Committee 9.1.5
An IDMC will be formed for this study. The  safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_590582]. Procedural details of the IDMC's structure 
and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC 
charter. The 
IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
9.2 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens 
 Study Design 9.2.1
A randomized, double-blind study design will avoid observer bias and reduce symptoms or 
outcomes arising from the subjects' knowledge of treatment. 
Subjects will be r
andomized to receive TEZ in combination with IVA, or a matched placebo 
regimen. All subjects enrolled in the study will continue their normal, stable treatment for CF 
symptoms throughout the study.  
Orkambi is the onl
y therapy approved for subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation  
that targets the underlying cause of CF. TEZ, an experimental CFTR corrector, in combination 
with IVA, is currently being evaluated in several Phase 3 studies in subjects who are both 
homozygous for F508del  and heterozygous for F508del  with other CFTR mutations. Scheduled 
IDMC reviews of each of the TEZ/IVA Phase 3 studies are completed and did not reveal any 
safety signals. Since subjects entering this study are not taking corrector/potentiator therapy, the 
use of placebo in this study is deemed ethical and necessary to adequately assess the benefit of 
treatment with TEZ in combination with IVA.  
Study 114 is designed to compare active treatment with TEZ 100 mg daily (qd)/IVA 150 mg 
every
 12 hours 
(q12h) with a matched placebo treatment for 8 weeks. The 8-week duration was 
selected to all
ow ad
equate exposure to TEZ/IVA to assess both the safety and efficacy of the 
treatment. This is appropriate because patients who have respi[INVESTIGATOR_590558]
k of exposure, and a significant response in ppFEV 1 is expected after 

Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 24 of 56 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  14 to 28 days of treatment with TEZ/IVA. In addition, the 8-week duration was selected to allow 
a robust assessment of the durability of response that will be less affected by [CONTACT_69506]-term 
variability in ppFEV 1, and to facilitate the demonstration of significant changes in secondary 
endpoints, including CFQ-R.  
 Study Drug Dose 9.2.2
The dose regimen of TEZ chosen for continued development in Phase 3 was evaluated in Study 
101, a Phase 2 study in 2 CF populations: one that was homozygous for F508del  and one that 
was heterozygous for F508del and G551D . The dose regimen of TEZ 100 mg qd in combination 
with IVA 150 mg q12h provided clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements 
in pp FEV 1 in both populations. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies are ongoing; therefore, results are not 
known. 
 Rationale for Study Assessments 9.2.[ADDRESS_778302] parameters for clinical studies in drug development. The 
efficacy assessments are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and 
relevant to the study of patients with CF. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: Since lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with 
CF, CF lung disease is the desired primary target of TEZ/IVA cotherapy. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_590559]. Predose and postdose 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_590560] (Table 3-1 and Table 3-2).  
CFQ- R: The CFQ-R is a frequently used CF-specific instrument that measures the health-related 
quality of life of patients with CF.7-9As both IVA alone and TEZ/IVA are systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
they have the potential to improve not only respi[INVESTIGATOR_590561]. These improvements can be captured by [CONTACT_11339]-respi[INVESTIGATOR_590562]-R. The adolescent/adult version, the parent/caregiver version, 
and the child version measure quality-of-life domains, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], digestive 
symptoms, emotion, and health perception. Linguistically validated versions of the CFQ-R10, [ADDRESS_778303] of TEZ/IVA on patient reports of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_315410]-related quality of life. 
9.3 Study Restrictions 
Prohibited medications and certain foods are not allowed in this study (Screening Period through 
the Safety Follow-up Contact) (Table 9-1). Both TEZ and IVA are metabolized predominantly 
via the hepatic enzymatic pathway using CYP3A4. Therefore, the use of known moderate and 
strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A, which have the potential to significantly alter the
 
exposure of TEZ and IVA, will be restricted in this study. 
A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and medication will be 
provided in the Study Reference Manual.

randomized in the study, details of prior medication will only be documented in the subjects' 
source documents. 
 Subjects must remain on a stable medication regimen for their CF from screening through the 
Safety Follow
-up Contact; this includes supplements and inhaled antibiotics. A stable 
medication regimen is defined as the current medication regimen for CF that subjects have 
been following for at least [ADDRESS_778309] be 
discussed and approved by
 [CONTACT_590583]. Guidelines for a stable inhaled 
antibiotic regimen for CF are as follows: 
• Subjects who are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled 
antibiotics should remain on that drug at the current regimen throughout the study. 
• Subjects who are on inhaled cycling antibiotics should continue on their current 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely 
as possible to the first day of inhaled cycling antibiotics. 
• Subjects who alternate [ADDRESS_778310] day of either of the inhaled antibiotics. 
 There are no restrictions on the concomitant use of corticosteroids.  
 Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spi[INVESTIGATOR_155393]  11.3.1.

Study drug administration guidelines: 
1. Study drug should be administered within [ADDRESS_778311] CF high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack. It is recommended that study drug 
be administered after the start of and before the end of a meal, and that the duration of each 
meal associated with study drug intake (i.e., breakfast and dinner/snack, as applicable) should 
not exceed 30 minutes.  
2. On days with no scheduled clinic visits, study drug should be administered q12h (± 2 hours). 
F
or each subject, all doses (morning [TEZ/IVA] and evening [IVA], or matching placebo) of 
study dru
gs will be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, if the 
morning dose is taken at 08:00 every morning, the evening dose should be taken at 20:00 
every evening (but it could be taken between 18:00 and 22:00). 
3. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site 
after predose assessments have been completed. The meal or snack will be provided by [CONTACT_590584].  
4. If a subject's scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used: 
 If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_778312]'s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should wit
hhold their morning dose of study drug and the morning dose will 
be administered in the clinic. 
 If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_778313]'s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject shou
ld take the morning dose at home and the evening dose will b e 
administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the 
evening dose. 
5. For visits after the Day 1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused 
materials assoc
iated with study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as 
appropria
te. 

Protocol VX16-661-[ADDRESS_778314] should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than [ADDRESS_778315]  elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the 
subject should skip that dose and resume hi s/her normal schedule for the following dose. For 
example, 
 if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she should take the 
dose with food as soon as possible. 
 if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and more 
than [ADDRESS_778316] elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is past 14:00), the 
subject would resume dosi ng with the evening dose  at approximately 20:00.

 Contraception and Pregnancy 1
1.4.4
The effects of TEZ/IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception 
Participation in this study requires a commitment from the subject and his/her partner to use at 
least [ADDRESS_778338] dose of study drug (unless otherwise
 noted) and until [ADDRESS_778339] 
dose of study drug. 
Contraception for the coup
le is waived for the following:  
 True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
 
 If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through 
examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_590586]. 
 If the female is of non-childbearing potential, per the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy. 
o Postmenopausal: continuous amenorrhea for at least 12 months and serum FSH levels 
≥40 mIU/mL.  
o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female achieves 
menarche during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of contraception 
or abstinence.  

Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 37 of 56 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  For subjects for whom contraception methods are not waived due to 1 of the reasons cited above, 
the foll
owing are acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects and their female (non-
study) pa
rtners, and for female subjects and their male (non-study) partners: 
Table 11-2 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
 Male vasectomy [ADDRESS_778340] -vasectomy semen analysis for sperm.  
 Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single product if commercially available and/or 
allowed according to local regulations; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products).  
 Female bilateral tubal li gation performed at least 6 months previously.  
 Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide (where available).  
 Female continuous use of an intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing or hormone releasing) for at least 90 
days.  
 Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation if successfully used for at least 60  days.  
 
Important notes: 
 Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. 
Please contact [CONTACT_64168]. 
 If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to 
local regulations and/or requirements. 
 Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to 
follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active. 
 Female condom used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) is not an 
acceptable method of contraception due to risk of tearing; a different acceptable method of 
birth control must be used as described in Table 11-2.  
 Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, 
and for [ADDRESS_778341] dose of study drug. 
 Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
during the study through [ADDRESS_778342] dose of study drug. 
 Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through [ADDRESS_778343] dos
e of study drug. 
Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the 
Vertex medical monitor on an individual basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy 
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for [ADDRESS_778344] dose of study drug(s). 
All pregnancies occurring during the study or within [ADDRESS_778345] be f
ollowed until resolution (i.e., birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the 
pregnancy). Any subject found to be pregnant at any time during the study will be withdrawn 
from the study immediately. Any pregnancy outcome that meets the criteria for an SAE will be 
reported as an SAE. 

Protocol VX16- 661-[ADDRESS_778346] becomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify 
Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy 
using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. 
The subject or partne
r will be followed until the end of the pregnancy and the infant will b e 
followed for [ADDRESS_778347] (seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug 
dosing at all visits.   
 Liver Function Test Parameters 11.4.[ADDRESS_778348] elevations of >3 × ULN and clinical 
symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by [CONTACT_590587] [ADDRESS_778349] is >5 × ULN, repeat 
follow-up levels must be obtained within 7 ± [ADDRESS_778350] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible 
(ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption 
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), and 
the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria is met and confirmed with 
repeat testing: 
 ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
 ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely f
or clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the elevated tests is identified, regardless of whether the levels have im
proved, 
study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within [ADDRESS_778351] elevation(s) has been identified, study drug may be 
resumed once the levels return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval of the 
medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, 
levels should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined elevation occurs within 
4 weeks of rechallenge with study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_155421] 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued, 
regardless of the presumed etiology. 
 Ophthalmologic Examination 11.4.7

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Medications used in this study will be coded by [CONTACT_363545]-Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as the following:  
 Prior medication:  any medication that started before initial dosing of study drug, regardless 
of when it ended 
 Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received at or after initial dosing 
of study drug through the end of the TE Period 
 Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received beyond the TE Period 
A given medication can be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing start/end 
date or time and cannot be determined whether it was taken before initial dosing, concomitantly, 
or beyond the TE Period, it will be considered as prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. 
Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively based on the 
FAS. Post-treatment medications will be listed for each subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Exposure to study drug (i.e., duration of treatment) will be summarized for the FAS in terms of 
duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of 
study drug plus 1. 
Dosing compliance will be summarized for the FAS and is calculated as the actual number of 
dosing occasions at which study drug was taken (including when administered at study visits), as 
a percentage of the planned number of dosing occasions. 
Duration of treatment and dosing compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_306028]. 
 Safety Analysis 12.3.3

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examination 
Physical examination findings will be presented as a data listing only. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pulse Oximetry 
For the treatment-emergent pulse oximetry measurements, a summary of raw values and change 
from baseline values will be provided by [CONTACT_590592]. In addition, the mean value 
at each visit will be plotted by [CONTACT_363550].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Postdose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_590571] 2-hour and 4-hour postdose measurements on Day 1, a summary of raw values for 
percent predicted FEV 1 will be provided by [CONTACT_139406]. The absolute change 
from the Day 1 predose value of percent predicted FEV 1 will be summarized by [CONTACT_590593]. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with percent predicted FEV 1 
decline of ≥10, ≥15, and  ≥20 percentage points in the absolute change from the Day 1 predose 
value, and the number and percentage of subjects with percent predicted FEV 1 decline of ≥10, 
≥15, and ≥20% in the relative change from Day  1 will be summarized by [CONTACT_590594]. 
 Efficacy Analysis 12.3.4
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Key Efficacy Variables 
The actual posterior/conditional probability will be calculated for the probability of a greater 
than zero (>0) treatment effect difference in mean ppFEV 1 change between TEZ/IVA and 
placebo is greater than or equal to 80%, based on the observed data of the efficacy endpoint on 
the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 
measurements. This will serve as the primary efficacy analysis outcome. 
Additionally, the key efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 to the 
average of the Day 28 and Day 56 measurements will be analyzed using a mixed-effects model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) with ppF EV 1 at each time point as the outcome variable. The 
MMRM model will include the absolute change from baseline in pp FEV 1 at each visit as the 
dependent variable; treatment, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects; and 
subject as a random effect, with adjustment for sex (male versus female), age group at the 
Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18  years old), and ppFEV 1 severity determined during the 
Screening (or baseline) Period (<40% versus ≥40% predicted).  
The estimated treatment effect within TEZ/IVA and placebo arm, as well as the estimated 
treatment difference between TEZ/IVA and placebo arm will be provided based on the MMRM 
model along with 95% CI. These results will serve as additional efficacy outcomes, which is in 
addition to the primary actual posterior/conditional probability outcome. Furthermore, treatment 
effect and treatment difference at each post-baseline visit, obtained from the model, will also be 
provided.

 Relative change in ppFEV 1 from baseline to the average of the Day 28 and Day 56 
measurements:  Analysis of this variable will be similar to the key efficacy analysis using an  
MMRM model but without calculation of the posterior/conditional probability based on this 
variable. 
 Absolute change in the CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_590572] 28 and Day 56 measurements:  Analysis of this domain will be similar to the key 
efficacy using an  MMRM model but without calculation of the posterior/conditional 
probability based on this variable, with the addition of the CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_590573] a covariate. 
 
 
 Tolerability Analysis 12.3.[ADDRESS_778363] summary of study drug 
discontinuation rate. Rate will be reported as descriptive statistics in counts and percentages,

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
 Adverse Events 13.1.1
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the
 ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, PEs, pulse oximetry, and vital signs will be 
assessed and those deemed to have clinically-significant worsening from baseline will be 
documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be 
provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., hepatitis). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment i
tself will be listed as the AE (e.g., elevated ALT). 
An abnormal study assessment is con
sidered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of 
the following: 
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
 A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093]. 
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value 
will be an SAE if t he subjec
t’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF and assent (where applicable) is signed until the 
following time points: 
 For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure or withdrawal of consent 
 For enrolled subjects who complete the study and for subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study drug and have a Safety Follow-up Contact: [CONTACT_273928]-up Contact 
 For enrolled subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug (including for withdrawal of 
consent) and do not have Safety Follow-up Contact, the earliest of: 
o [ADDRESS_778364] dose of study drug 
(see Section  9.1.4 ) 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_778365]'s source documents. The following data will be documented 
for each AE: 
 Description of the event 
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
 Severity  
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity 
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. AEs of CTCAE 
Gr
ades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” In considering the severity of an AE in 
a pediatric subject, the investiga
tor will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical 
laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that 
does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Causality 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 

Protocol VX16- 661-[ADDRESS_778366] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly rela ted There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as charact eristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is r elated to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken 
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  
Table  13-[ADDRESS_778367] to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/ resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/ resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/ not 
resolved ( continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
 

Protocol VX16- 661-114 Version 3.1 US Page 49 of 56 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  [IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given 
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drug) 
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94250], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168788], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94252]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168789] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they ar e not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow-up Contact, regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_590598]16- 661-[ADDRESS_778368] and are considered 
re
lated to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter 
referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately 
reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_460428](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be 
assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and 
severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not 
resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes 
of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, 
re
gardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be 
completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously 
reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes 
available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.

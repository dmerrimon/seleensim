Study Drug Description:  
 A-101 Solution (40% and 45%) is a hydrogen peroxide solution  that will be supp lied in a glass ampule 
with an applicator to be applied to seborrheic keratosis lesions of the trunk, extremities and face. .     
 
The study drug, A-101 (hydrogen peroxide) 40% and 45%  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] (hereafter referred to as A -
101) is a colorless solutio n that must be stored at room temperature (20-25º C or 68 -77 º F), protected 
from light.  
 
Study Objectives:  
 Primary:  
 
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of A -101 40% and A- 101 45% versus 
vehicle for the treatment of 4 seborrheic keratosis (SK) Target Lesions on the trunk, extremities and face.  
 
Secondary : 
 
The secondary objectives of this study include:  
• Dura tion of response  
• Safety  
Study Design:   
This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized study to evaluate the safety and  efficacy of A101 40% and 
A101 45% versus vehicle.  Subjects will be required to have a total of 4 target seborrheic keratosis (SK) 
lesions located on their trunk, extremities and face.  At least one of the [ADDRESS_708411] be on the trunk or extremities.   
 
Subjects will be randomized to one of 3 treatment arms in a 1: 2:2 ratio.  Fifty subjects will be randomized 
to the Vehicle treatment arm and 100 subjects will be randomized to each A -101 ac tive treatment arm.  
Subje cts will receive a maximum of 2 treatments [Day 1 (Visit 2) and re-treatment on Day 22 (Visit 4) if 
a target lesion meets the criteria for re-treatment].   The duration of study participation is anticipated to be 
up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_708412].   
 
Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical chemistry), vital 
signs, assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), and concomitant 
medication review.

Safety: 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_160811],  clinical laboratory exams,  vital signs, concomitant 
medications, as well as through skin examinations and general physical exams.    
 
Study Drug Administration  
 Study drug medication will be applied to each of the four Target L esions during Visit [ADDRESS_708419] percentages of target lesions judged to be clear on the PLA (PLA = 0) at Visit 8.  To 
conduct this analysis, the percentage of each subject’s target lesions judged to be clear on the PLA at Visit [ADDRESS_708420].  Then the analysis will calculate the mean of this 
parameter for each treatment group (yielding an estimate of the mean percentage of clear lesions across subjects), and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model will be used to perform all pair -wise comparisons 
among the treatment groups.  Pair -wise comparisons will be conducted on the least -squares means using 
the overall pooled error term of the model.  All efficacy analyses will be based on the per protocol (PP) 
population, defined as all randomize d subjects who completed the study with no major protocol violation.  
 A secondary effectiveness analysis will be conducted using the same methodology as the primary efficacy analysis based on the mean of per -subject percentages of target lesions judged to  be clear or near -clear on 
the PLA (PLA ≤1) at Visit 8.  
 
Safety Analysis  
Safety endpoints for adverse events (AEs) include the following:  incidences of all treatment -emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) and all serious AEs (SAEs); by [CONTACT_926], by [CONTACT_542818].  Safety endpoints for AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and 
physical examinations and local skin reactions will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  All 
safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

2.1. Summary  
Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is one of the most common skin tumors in man. These benign 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_542799], increasing in prevalence with increasing age, and affect men and women roughly equally. While the growths may be 
solitary, they often occur in large numbers and typi[INVESTIGATOR_542800], elevated or “stuck -on” appearing papules or plaques that may vary from flesh- colored, to shades of yellow, 
gray, brown, or black (Haffner C 2008).  Though benign, SK lesions are often cosmetically worrisome to patients, must sometimes be 
distinguished from other benign or malignant skin tumors and may become pruritic, irritated, bleed, and may be painful when traumatized particularly when located in areas prone to friction and trauma, such as belt -lines and brassiere-strap lines.  
 Patients may seek treatment of SK for cosmetic reasons, especially if they are large, pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], and/or if multiple lesions are present, or simply because the lesions are comm only associated 
with “old age”. Removal may be medically indicated, however, for lesions that become irritated, pruritic, inflamed, or painful, or for lesions that the clinician feels require histologic confirmation of the diagnosis.   Numerous treatment o ptions exist, and include a plethora of destructive/ablative modalities such 
as liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, electrodesicc ation, lasers of various wavelengths (ablative and 
non-ablative), radio -frequency ablation, and surgical removal by [CONTACT_542819]. 
There is, however, a notable lack of well -controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy, 
complications,  and complication rates of these treatments. There is great variability among 
practitioners in the methods employed using each of these  techniques ( e.g., variability in contact 
[CONTACT_542820]) with  great variability of the results. 
None of these treatments is, in fact, approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis. While these methods can be effective, many require specialized training and/or the use of expensive equipment, they are painful and may require anesthesia and/or analgesia, and they are often complicated by [CONTACT_542821]. Both hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_542801], which may be transient, but are often permanent, are common, as is scarring at the treatment site, and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_17396] -surgical risks of 
bleeding and infection increase the risk that the result of the treatment  of these lesions may be 
worse than the disease itself  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_160807] 2003)  (Motley 2002) (McKee PH 2005).

peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including 
chlorine- free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 
has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene products and tooth- whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment 
of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use as an oral topi[INVESTIGATOR_160777], H
2O2 is widely emplo yed at low 
concentrations ( e.g., 3%-6%) as a wound irrigant and topi[INVESTIGATOR_113380]/disinfectant, and has been 
in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by [CONTACT_160821] 1858.  (Schumb 
WC 1955)  (Chan HP 2008)  (Richardson, On Peroxide of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water as a 
Remedy: Continued from a Research Commenced in the Year 1858 1891)  (Richardson, On 
Peroxide of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water, as a Remedy: Continued from Research Commenced in the Year 1858 1891)  (Richardson, On the Introduction of Peroxide of Hydrogen as a Medicine 
1866) (Watt BE 2004 )(Zonios 2007).  H
2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of 
reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by [CONTACT_46917] a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, lipid peroxidase and others, as well as non-enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and uric acid, tocopherol, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water soluble groups.  The local application of supra -
physiologic concentrations of H
2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, 
allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of 
reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by [CONTACT_274294] O
2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells.  
 
Data from a proof of concept study (A -101- SEBK -201) demonstrated that topi[INVESTIGATOR_542802] A -101 Solution 40% and 32.5% has the potential to safely and effectively 
resolve SK lesions without the need for analgesia and/or anesthesia, and with a minimal risk of hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring.  Further, data from two dose -ranging studies (A -101- SEBK -202 evaluating SK lesions on the 
trunk and extremities; A -101- SEBK -203 evaluating SK lesions on the face) demonstrated that 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8719] A -101 Solution 40% is superior to both A -101 Solution Vehicle and A -
101 Solution 32.5% for safely and effectively treating seborrheic keratosis lesions in adult subjects and has an acceptable safety profile.

[ADDRESS_708423] frequent being a protocol violation (2.6% vehicle, 2.2% A-101). Two subjects (0.4% vehicle, 0.4% A-101) discontinued due to an AE or SAE. The mean age was 68.7 years (range 
42 to 90, 42.0% were at least 71 years old), 41.3% of subjects were male and 58.7% were female, and 97.8% were Caucasian. The most common Fitzpatrick skin types were 2 (46.9%) and 3 (27.3%). 
Treatment with A -101 40% showed statistically significant efficacy compared to treatment with 
vehicle based on the primary analysis .  
For the primary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance (PLA  = 0) of 
all 4 target lesions at Visit 8 (Day 106) was 4.0% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle 
(p = 0.0019).  For the secondary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance 
of at least 3 of the 4 target lesions at Visit 8 was 13.45% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with 
vehicle (p  < 0.0001). 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events ( TEAEs ) were reported for 45 (19.8%) subjects in the 
vehicle group and 54 (24.2%) subjects in the A -[ADDRESS_708424] frequently reported TEAEs 
were nasopharyngitis (3.1% vehicle, 1.3%  A-101), bronchitis (0.4% vehicle, 1.3% A -101), and 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (1.3% vehicle, 0.4% A -101).  Six (2.6%) subjects in the vehicle 
group had 8 SAEs and 4  (1.8%) subjects in the A -101 group had 4 SAEs.  The SAEs were all 
considered not related to study medication.  Two subjects, 1 in each treatment group, 
discontinued the study due to an SAE.  
LSRs were few and predominantly mild.  The LSRs of pruritus and stinging reported by [CONTACT_542822], edema, erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scaling, and vesicles reported by [CONTACT_542823] 8 (Day 106).  
There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital signs.

2.2.3. A-101- SEBK -303 
A-101- SEBK -303 was a n open label safety study in which subjects received up to 4 applications 
of A-101 40% Solution to SK lesions on their face, trunk or extremities.   
 
A total of 147 subjects were enrolled and treated and 139 subjects (94.6%) completed the study.  Five subjects withdrew consent and [ADDRESS_708428] to follow -up.  The mean age was 
68.4 years (range 35 to 94, 40.1% were at least 71 years old), 32.0% of subjects were male and 
68.0% were female, and 93.9% of subjects were Caucasian.  The most common Fitzpatrick skin types were 2 (48.3%) and 3 (32.0%).  At Visit 12 (Day 148) in the ITT population, 10.9% of subjects had all 4 target lesions judged to be clear on the PLA (PLA = 0), 18.4% had at least 3 of 4 target lesions judged to be clear, and 27.9% had all 4 target lesions judged to be cl ear or near clear (PLA ≤ 1).  In the PP population, 
the PLA average per -subject percent of target  lesions judged to be clear at Visit 12 was 28.2%. 
 
TEAEs were reported for 25 (17.0%) subjects.  The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
cough, seasonal aller gy, and sinusitis (2.0% each).  No TEAEs were reported as severe, no SAEs 
were reported, and no subject discontinued the study due to an AE or SAE.  
LSRs reported were predominantly mild and most commonly included transient pruritus, stinging, crusting, ede ma, erythema, and scaling post -treatment that usually resolved by [CONTACT_542826].  Few lesions had LSRs at Visit 12. 
There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital 
signs.

(hydrogen peroxide) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_28198] 40% was both effective and well -tolerated for the 
treatment of subjects with multiple seborrheic keratosis lesions of the trunk, extremities, and 
face.   
3. STUDY RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES  
3.1. Rationale 
The rationale for this study is to assess safety and efficacy of A -101 45% A -101 40% and 
Vehicle when applied to [ADDRESS_708429] be on the trunk or 
extremities.  
 Aclaris recently completed three phase 3 clinical studies (301, 302, and 303) that demonstrated 
that A -101 40% is both safe and effective in treating subjects with seborrheic keratosis lesions on 
the face, trunk and extremities.  In addition, a randomized phase 2 study in subjects with common warts in which A -101 40% was compared to A -101 45% was completed.  This study 
demonstrated that the higher concentration of A -101 45% was not only effective at treating 
subjects with a common wart but it also demonstrated that there was no increase in local skin reactions with the higher concentration.  The results from these 4 clinical trials warrants further exploration of A-101 45% in subjects with SK lesions.    
3.2. Study Objectives  
3.2.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the  safety and effectiveness of A-101 45% 
compared to A-101 40% and each active treatment arm to  Vehicle for the treatment of 4 
seborrheic keratosis (SK)  Target Lesions on the trunk, extremities and face. For each subject,  at 
least [ADDRESS_708430] be on the trunk or 
extremities.  
3.2.2. Secondary Objective  
The secondary objectives of this study include: 
• Dura tion of response 
• Safety  of A -101 
4. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase 2, randomized, multi -center, study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
A-101 45% compared to A- 101 40% and  each active treatment arm to Vehicle in subjects with 
seborrheic keratosis les ions.   
 During the study, the investigator will identify [ADDRESS_708431] be on the trunk or extremities.  The Target Lesions will be treated at a maximum of two treatment visits
.

second application 
• Allow the Target Lesion to remain undisturbed for ~60 seconds 
• After ~60 seconds repeat the ~20 second application process 
• Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been applied to the 
Target Lesion up to 4 times.  
 
7.5.3. Applying Study Medication to the Face  
To apply the study medication to Target Lesions on the FA CE the staff member will follow 
these treatment instructions: 
• Do not apply the study medications to eyes, mouth, mucous membranes, open wounds 
• Do not apply the study medication to the eyelids or within 5 mm of the orbital rim 
• If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_542807]: 
o Position the subject in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_542808].  
o Aclaris Therapeutics will supply sites supplies of white petrolatum (100%) United 
States Pharmacopeia (USP) that is to be applied along the orbital rim and at the 
medial and lateral canthi; gently stretch the periorbital skin between the thumb 
and forefinger at the time of petrolatum applicatio n to distend any periorbital 
rhytides (e.g., “crow’s feet”) and ensure full coverage of the skin at the base of 
the rhytides to decrease the likelihood of tracking of the study medication 
towards the eye 
o Have the subject hold an absorbent pad in the appropriate area of the eye to 
absorb any excess study medication that might track away from the Target Lesion  
o Instruct the subject to keep both eyes closed during the entire study medication 
treatment procedure 
• After the subject is properly prepared and positioned, thoroughly cleanse the Target 
Lesion by [CONTACT_160830] a swab/wipe wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol 
• Using firm pressure, squeezing in the middle of the applicator, apply one drop of study 
medication onto the SK lesion and then move applicator around in a circular motion to fully saturate the lesion.  Apply the study medication for approximately 20 seconds 
• Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin 
• During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin 
using a clean absorbent wipe 
• Ensure the Target Lesion is wet with study medication at the end of the ~20 second 
application  
• Allow the Target Lesion to remain undisturbed for ~60 seconds 
• After ~60 seconds repeat the ~20 second application process 
• Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been applied to the 
Target Lesion up to 4 times.  
 Repeat the treatment procedure that is appropriate for the body location ( i.e., trunk and 
extremities or face) until all Target Lesions that require treatme nt have been treated.

 After completing the study medication treatment to the Target Lesion do not disturb the Target Lesion until just prior to the subject’s post- treatment LSR evaluation .   
 Just prior to the subject’s post -treatment LSR evaluation absorb any remaining study medication 
and gently dab or otherwise dry the Target Lesion with an absorbent pad or dry gauze without wipi[INVESTIGATOR_542809].    
7.6. Video Recording of Study Medication Application 
At one identified  investigational site, a group of subjects will have the application of their A -101 
study medication video recorded.  The video recording will be performed during Visit 2 (Day 1) and will be done by a third- party imaging vendor.  Up to [ADDRESS_708457] report the visit number, visit date, Target Lesion number(s) the subject refused to allow treatment for and the reason for the refusal in the subject’s CRF .  
 If the subject’s refusal is associated with an A E, the investigator must also report the event on the 
appropriate CRF.   The subject must have the Visit [ADDRESS_708458] does not need to be removed from the study based solely on her/his refusal to have a study medication retreatment at Visit 4.

9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and 
appropriately trained staff member or the subject, will perform the following safety assessments 
according to the schedules noted below.  The investigational staff member performing the LSR evaluations must not participate in the study medication treatment for the subject being evaluated.  
 
9.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSR)  
The LSR assessment is the investigator’s assessment  of the signs and the subject’s assessment of the 
symptoms associated with irritation at each  Target Lesion  site, which includes the Target Lesion 
and the area immediately surrounding the Target Lesion . The investigator and subject may refer to 
other evaluation s (photographs)  to assist with these assessments. However, investigators may only 
refer to these evaluations after the PLA has been performed.   
 Local Skin Reactions:  
• Signs (assessed by [CONTACT_093]):  
o Erythema  
o Edema  
o Scaling/dryness  
o Vesicles/bulla e 
o Crusting  
o Erosion 
o Ulceration  
o Post-inflammatory hyper -pi[INVESTIGATOR_542813]: A -101-SEBK-204 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

Date:   [ADDRESS_708471]-inflammatory hypo -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (does not include the superficial transient skin 
blanching/whitening related to the action of the study medications)  
o Atrophy  
o Scarring.  
 
• Symptoms (assesse d by [CONTACT_423]):  
o Stinging/burning  
o Pruritus (itch).  
 
At Visits [ADDRESS_708472] will evaluate the LSR signs and the LSR symptoms at 
each Target Lesion  site respectively.  
 The investigator will assess the LSR signs as follows: 
• Visits 2 and 4: 
o For each Target Lesion site report the severity for all signs prior to any study medication treatment  
o For every treated Target Lesion site, 20 (±4) minutes after the Treatment Completion Time, report the severity for the following signs: 
 Erythema  
 Edema  
 Scaling/dryness  
 Vesicles/bullae.  
• Visits 3 and 5-8: 
o For each Target Lesion site, report the severity for all signs.  
 The subject will assess the LSR symptoms as follows: 
• Visits 2 and 4: 
o For each Target Lesion site report the average of the severity ov er the previous 24 
hours for all symptoms prior to any study medication treatment 
o For every treated Target Lesion site, 10 (±4) minutes after the Treatment Completion Time, report the average of the severity of the LSR for all symptoms since completion of the study medication treatment.  
• Visits 3 and 5-8: 
o For each Target Lesion site, report the average of the severity over the previous [ADDRESS_708473]’s assessment.  
 The investigator should report the one integer that best describes the severity of each LSR sign for each Target Lesion site using th e scale below. Each subject should report the one integer that 
best describes the severity of each LSR symptom for each Target Lesion site using the scale below:

9.2. Vital signs  
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 2 prior to 
randomization, and at Visit 8. The following items will be measured: 
• Body temperature  
• Pulse rate  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39870] n rate  
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes  
• Height (at Visit 1 only)  
• Weight (at Visit 1 only).  
 Any measure that is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], abnormal AND clinically significant  (CS 
must b e recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if 
found after the first study medication treatment begins (Section 10.1).  
 A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >90mm Hg is considered abnormal and therefore must be defined as CS  or not clinically significant  (NCS ) on the CRFs.  
9.3. Clinical laboratory sampling 
Non-fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualif ied staff 
member at Visit [ADDRESS_708474]. These blood samples will be sent to a central 
laboratory for analysis.  Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for instructions regarding handling of the blood samples and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].    The following tests, at a minimum, will be conducted:  
Chemistry Panel  Complete Blood Count  
Albumin  Hematocrit  
Alkaline phosphatase  Hemoglobin  
Alanine ami notransferase (ALT)  Platelet count  
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  Red blood cell morphology

 The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reporte d on the central laboratory’s standard 
reports. These laboratory results will be sent to the investigator via fax.  The investigator must 
review all laboratory reports in a timely manner and note NC S or C S to define the clinical 
relevance of any result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must date and initial every laboratory report.  
 The investigator must review the Visit [ADDRESS_708475]’s pregnancy documented and followed as outlined in 
Section 11. 
 
9.5. Other Evalu ations 
9.5.1. Demographics and medical history 
At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will collect demographic information including date of 
birth, sex at birth , race and, if appropriate, ethnicity for each subject.  
 At Visit 1, the investigator must determine  each subject’s Fitzpatrick skin type and document 
appropriately on the subject’s CRF.

 Medical history information will be recorded including all medical conditions and disease states that, at Visit 1:  
• Are ongoing 
• Require concomitant therapy  
• Are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], relevant to the subject’s study participation. 
 
9.5.2. Standardized photography  
At Visits 1, [ADDRESS_708476] be visible in the photographs (Section 
8.1). The subject’s identity will not be revealed in the study photographs.  At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication treatment. Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning relative to the 
camera and camera settings are used for each photograph.  
 Equipment, supplies, training and detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs will be provided to the investigational center prior to the initiation of subject enrollment.

10.1. Definitions  
10.1.1. Adverse events (AE)  
• An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that 
develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a 
pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the 
study drug.  An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops  or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease 
under study (or any concurrent disease), whether or not considered related to the 
study drug.  Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre -existing conditions.  (N
OTE: A condition, recorded as 
pre-existing, that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs 
during the study should be recorded as an adverse event.) 
• drug interactions 
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study 
• laboratory or diagnost ic test abnormalities occurring after the start of the study 
(i.e., after screening and once confirmed by [CONTACT_15013]) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work- up, or is consider ed by [CONTACT_542834].  N
OTE: Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that 
preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but will be recorded to monitor data  from patients who 
do not meet screening criteria.  
Worsening of any of the Target Lesion assessments should be reported as an AE ONLY if 
the use of the study medication is interrupted or discontinued or if therapy is required to manage the event.  
 The investigator must, for any Target Lesion related AE, question the subject in detail to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by [CONTACT_274307], 
sunburn) for any such AE.   
Protocol: A -101-SEBK-204 Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
 
 
Page 43 of 67    
Date:   [ADDRESS_708477] study medication treatment should be reported 
as medical history, not as an AE. 
 
10.1.2. Serious adverse event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157748]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  or 
• Is an important medical event.  
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274281]- patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160805] . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre- existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.    Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
10.1.3. Adverse event reporting period  
The investigator must start reporting non- serious AEs starting with the subject’s first study 
medication treatment continuing until Visit 5. Non -serious adverse events that occur between the 
time the subject was consent ed and the first application of study medication will be reported as 
medical history.   
 
Reporting for SAEs begins after the subject signs the informed consent and continues until Visit 6 (regardless of relationship to study medication).  If a subject  experience s a SAE after Visit [ADDRESS_708478] report 
this to the Sponsor using the study specific SAE report form.

Date:   [ADDRESS_708479] appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
 
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity 
Severe – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity.  
 
10.1.5. Relationship to study medication 
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant ther api[INVESTIGATOR_118199]) to determine the 
relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the study medication by [CONTACT_118238]:  
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
study medication and the AE.  Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE. 
 The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A). 
 
10.2. Reporting Procedures  
10.2.1. Procedures for reporting adverse events  
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs 
using a non- directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the 
previous study visit?”    The investigator or designee will m onitor the subject for at least [ADDRESS_708480]’s response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the 
investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations.  
 Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE CRF.

resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as “Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject’s last study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae. 
 
10.2.2. Procedure for reporting a serious adverse event  
Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not related 
to the study medications, the investigator must:  
 
1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
2. Immediately inform th e Medical Monitor of the SAE:

Telephone:  484 -321-5555 
Serious Adverse Event Facsimile:  484 -324-2359 
Email:  [EMAIL_4161] 
 
3. Within 24-hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any 
other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, 
laboratory test results) must be faxed to the SAE Fax line liste d above. 
4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the 
subject’s last study visit, until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118200] a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae AND the investigator and Medical Monitor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved.  
5. Inform the Medical Monitor of SAE updates by [CONTACT_542835] e- mail.  
6. Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements and Aclaris Therapeut ics, Inc. 
instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC).  
 
10.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event 
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any tim e at 
the discretion of the investigator.  If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time.  The patient will be monitored until the event h as resolved or stabilized, until a 
determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional.  The investigator must inform

bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral mini- laparotomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal 
is defined as ≥12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. Women who a re 
WOCBP and are using an active method of birth control, are practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile ( e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be WOCBP. 
  All WOCBP must use an active method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Abstinence or having a sterile partner is not an active method of birth control.  Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for a pregnancy.  The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  During the trial, all WOCBP will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_28265] ( e.g., 
missed or late menstrual period). 
 If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study medication administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are available.  If pregnancy is con firmed, the subject must not receive study medication and must be 
discharged from the study.   If, following study medication administration, it is determined that the subject may have been or was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including at least 2 days after study medication administration) the investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor and record the event on a pregnancy surveillance form. While not an AE or SAE, the investigator must report every pregnancy using a pregnancy surveillance form and follow the reporting procedures described for SAE reporting (Section 10.2.2).  
 Protocol- required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] ( e.g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow- up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the investigator must report 
to the Medical Monitor on the pregnancy surveillance form, follow -up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of six weeks.

Date:   [ADDRESS_708483] deviation for 
the primary efficacy parameter is approximately 23.7 %. The mean difference between the two 
Active treatment groups is expected to be approximately 10 percentage points. With 
approximately 250 randomized subjects this study is  expected to achieve approximately 85% 
power for the comparison between the two Active treatment groups, and more than 95% power for the pair -wise comparisons between each Active treatment group and the Vehicle group.  
Two-tail alpha will be set to 0.[ADDRESS_708484] percentages of target lesions judged to be clear on the PLA 
(PLA = 0) at Visit 8.  To conduct this analysis, the percentage of each subject’s target lesions judged to be clear on the PLA at Visit [ADDRESS_708485].   Then the 
analysis will calculate the mean of this parameter for each treatment group (yielding an estimate of the mean percentage of clear lesions across subjects), and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model will be used to perform all pair -wise compariso ns among the treatment groups.  Pair -wise 
comparisons will be conducted on the least -squares means using the overall pooled error term of 
the model.  All efficacy analyses will be based on the per protocol (PP) population, defined as all randomized subjects who completed the study with no major protocol violation.   A secondary effectiveness analysis will be conducted using the same methodology as the primary efficacy analysis based on the mean of per -subject percentages of target lesions judged 
to be clear  or near -clear on the PLA (PLA <= 1) at Visit 8.   The primary and secondary analyses 
above will also be conducted separately for lesions in each body location, using the same methodology as specified above.  In addition to the above Visit 8 analyses, each of these analyses will be conducted at each other 
visit where PLA scores are collected, as exploratory analyses.  
 Three exploratory responder analyses will be conducted using the following criteria for classifying subjects as responders:  
 Subjects with PLA  = 0 for all 4 target lesions at Visit 8;  
Subjects with PLA = [ADDRESS_708486] 3 target lesions at Visit 8; and  
Subjects with PLA <= 1 for all 4 target lesions at Visit 8.  
 For each exploratory analysis, separate chi -square tests will be used to compare the percentage of 
responders between each active treatment group and the vehicle treatment group, and between the two active treatment groups.  The chi-square analyses may be supplemented by [CONTACT_542836] 3 pairwise comparisons to be performed within a single model.

This will be done for each treatment group separately.  
 For all analyses, two -tail alpha will be set to 0.05 with no adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
ANOVAs will include Site in the model if doing so improves the sensitivity of the model for comparing treatment groups.   
 
12.3. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the ITT population. The proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated and presented by 
[CONTACT_160843] (MedDRA) System Organ Class. Vital signs, LSR scores and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_160844]. No inferential testing will be performed.  Data from all random ized subjects will be presented and summarized. Safety summaries by [CONTACT_160845], and changes from  pre- application values in vital signs.  
Adverse event summaries will be presented by  [CONTACT_118245], both  overall and by [CONTACT_7204]. 
12.4. Interim Analysis  
An interim Analysis will not be conducted for this study.     
13. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
13.1. Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the  study subjects  or when the change involves only 
logistics or administration.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_274286] . 
 
13.2. Protocol Deviations, Violations and Exceptions 
A protocol deviation  is non- adherence to protocol -specific study procedures or schedules that 
does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP  
 guidelines.  Deviations are considered minor and do not impact the study.  Deviations include study procedures that occurred outside the treatment windows (except for treatment application days) .  
 A protocol violation  is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject is administered a p rohibited medication , primary objective variable criteria, 
and/or GCP guidelines.  Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by [CONTACT_223060], on the CRF.

to allow patients to enter a study.  If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered 
ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study.  If investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria was entered in a study (a  protocol violation), they must immediately inform sponsor/CRO.  Such 
subjects  will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and 
written approval by [CONTACT_3211]/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP. 
13.3. Training  
For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study subjects.  
 It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinators or other applicable personnel attend this visit.  During this visit, participants will be trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs.  Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to 
participatin g in any of the procedures and evaluations in this study.

Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study.  The data 
collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11.  The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study.  Before using the 
CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training.  After they are trained, users will be provided with individual system access right s. 
The handling of data, including data quality assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions.  Data management and control processes specific to this study will be described in a data management plan.    At the end of the study, the database will be locked and the data will be released for  
reporting and statistical analysis  
13.6. Quality Assurance 
The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements as well as applicable ICH guidelines, Helsinki Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub- contractor SOPs for study 
conduct and monitoring. 
Audits may be carried out by [CONTACT_542838] T herapeutics, Inc. or Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.’s 
representatives and inspections may be performed by [CONTACT_118247]/ECs before, 
during or after the study.  The investigator will provide the auditing/inspecting group direct access to all study records ( e.g., CRFs, subject medical records, study medication dispensing 
records) and the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate.  
13.7. Record  Retention  
All pertinent data, samples, photographs, correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc./CRO /investigator archives for the legally requ ired duration for archiving. 
The investigator should maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in 
compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are 
protected from accidental destructio n or disposal. 
If the Investigator needs to re -assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to 
retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility.  The investigator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc ., in writing, of the name [CONTACT_542841]. 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor to store these in sealed containers in an off -site storage location so that they can be 
returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_8775] m ade for off -site storage.

14. ETHICS AND GENERAL STUDY CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)  
This protocol and any accompanying material, including information that will be provided to prospective patients (such as advertisements, patient information sheets, or study descriptions used to induce study participation or obtain informed consent) must be submitted to the Central  
IRB for approval .  Approval of each such submission must be obtained from the committee 
before it may be used in the study and must be documented in a written notification to the Investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval.  In particular, each informed consent document must bear clear evidence (written, stamp, date of approval, etc.) of IRB approval before it may be presented to prospective (or ongoing, as appropriate) study patients for signature.  
Written evidence of the approval must be made available to the Sponsor.  Any modifications made to the protocol and of correspondingly modified informed consent documents made after receipt of Central IRB approval must also be submitted to the committee for approval before 
implementation unless the modification is made on an emergency basis to protect the welfare of study patients.  In the latter case, the Central IRB must be notified promptly and their written 
approval must be obtained as soon after the fact as possible.  
Appropriate reports on the progress of the study will be made to the Central IRB and the Sponsor 
by [CONTACT_542839] C entral  IRB and the Sponsor.  The shortest time interval between 
required reports required by [CONTACT_160848]. 
The Investigator at each investigative site, or his/her nominee, will be responsible for reporting 
any SAEs to the Cen tral IRB as soon as possible, and in accordance with the guidelines of the 
Central IRB.  
The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all serious, life threatening or fatal adverse study drug events with a causal relationship to the study drug to appropria te regulatory agencies within

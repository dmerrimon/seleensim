19The popularit y of BoNT/A cosmetic treatment of GL and LCL in adults is related to its proven 
efficacy for reducing moderate to severe facial lines (Beer 2006 );well documented safet yprofile
(Brin 2009); and positive impact on psy chological well -being and the resulting ps ychosocial 
benefits ( Finn 2003).
2.3. Benefit/Risk  Assessment
Generally , the popularit y of BoNT/A cosmetic treatment of GL and LCL in adults is related to its 
proven efficacy  for reducing moderate to severe facial lines ( Beer 2006 );well documented safety
profile(Brin 2009
); and positive impact on psy chological well- being and the resulting 
psychosocial benefits ( Finn 2003). Compared with the general class of BoNT/A treatments, 
MT10109L  provides additional benefits. For one, i t is provided as a read y-to-use liquid product.

478.3.3. Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
After the initial adverse event/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant who received study  intervention at subsequent visits/contacts. All TEAEs /SAEs , 
including AESIs  willbe followed until resolution, stabiliz ation , the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3).
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  
[CONTACT_268332]/or causalit y of the adverse event or SAE as fully  as possible. This may  
include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
If a participant dies during parti cipation in the study  or during a recognized follow -up period, the 
investigator will provide the sponsor with a cop y of an y postmortem findings including 
histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed eCRF.
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information.
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_11012] a nSAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a 
study  intervention under clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and othe r 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply  with country -specific regulatory  requirements relating to safet y 
reporting to the regulatory  authorit y, IRB
s/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]R saccording to local regulatory  
requirements and sponsor policy  and forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a nSAE or other

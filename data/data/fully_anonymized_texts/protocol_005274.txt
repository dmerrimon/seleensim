Title A Multi -national, Multi -center, Prospective, Randomized, Double 
Blinded, Placebo -controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of 
HyperBox Cycli cal Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151004]  (TWO 2) in the 
Treatment of Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcers  
Objectives  To evaluate the efficacy, safety and economic benefits of Cycli cal 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151007] ( TWO 2) Therapy in the treatment of chronic 
diabetic foot ulcers  
Device  HyperBox Cyclical Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151004] (TWO 2) System  
applied [ADDRESS_174041] s will be treated in a home care environment (home or 
equivalent facility)

 Ulcer duration ≥ 4 weeks but ≤ 1 year  
 Wound size reduction in a 2 -week run -in period of ≤ 30%  
Number of centers  Up to [ADDRESS_174042] s Conservative sample size estimation suggested a total sample size of 
220 subjects. The trial will be using a group sequential design (GSD) 
allowing for interim analys es to be performed after one third of 
subjects complete [ADDRESS_174043]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174044] billions of dollars each year.2 
 
Foot disorders are also the leading causes of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151008].2 Diabetic peripheral wounds are a major risk factor for lower extremity amputation.3 
Approximately 40 -70% of all low er extremity amputations are performed in patients with 
diabetes, and some 100,000 non -traumatic lower -limb amputations were performed among 
U.S. diabetics in 2008 alone.4 Even superficial diabetic wounds are often difficult to treat and 
show high rates of  complications.5 
 
Oxygen (O 2) is essential to wound healing. Local tissue hypoxia, caused by [CONTACT_151046], is one key factor that limits wound healing.6,7 It is well established 
that O 2 is vital in the synthesis of collagen, enhance ment of fibroblasts, angiogenesis and 
leukocyte function.8-10 O2 also has key functions in energy metabolism11,12 and in the 
inhibition of microbial growth.13 
 
Clinical use of O 2 to promote wound healing began in the 1960’s with the administration of 
systemic full body Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO) to treat wounds.[ADDRESS_174045] chambers utilizing pressures of 2,500 mb and 
higher. H BO is reimbursed by [CONTACT_151047], including Diabetic Foot Ulcers ( DFU’s ). A Cochrane review by [CONTACT_151048]. demonstrated that in people with foot ulcers due to diabetes, HBO significantly reduced 
the risk of major amputation and may improve the chance of healing at one year.14 The 
availability of HBO facilities, contraindications, the need to transfer the patients to the HBO 
facilities and the risks of undesired systemic side effects, limit s the widespread use of HBO to 
treat diabetic ulcers on a global basis.  
 
In an effort to address some of these drawbacks, the principle of topi[INVESTIGATOR_151009] (TWO 2) was introduced in the late 60’ s.15 The 
approach of topi[INVESTIGATOR_151010]. TWO 2 does not 
involve pressures anywhere near as high as in HBO. Additionally, TWO 2 is portable and can 
be administered in varied care sites, including in the patient’s home. There  have been a 
number of studies, including smaller Randomized Control Trials ( RCTs ) and Case Series 
etc., published demonstrating very positive outcomes with TWO 2. 15-[ADDRESS_174046]. In outpatients with severe diabetic foot ulcers referred for care to a community wound 
care clinic, 14 out of 17 ulcers (82.4%) in the treatment group an d 5 of 11 ulcers (45.5%) in 
the control group healed within 90 days. The median of wound healing in the oxygen group 
was 56 vs. 93 days in the control group (p = 0.04).  
 
The concept of topi[INVESTIGATOR_151011]  a whole 
and a larger well conducted randomized clinical trial is clearly needed to establish topi[INVESTIGATOR_151012].  
 
This trial will evaluate the efficacy and potential economic benefits of TWO [ADDRESS_174047]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, 2016        8 used to provide data for health economic analyses .  
2.2. Medical Device  
The medical device  being investigated in this trial is the HyperBox C yclical Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151013] (TWO 2) system manufactured by  [CONTACT_151049]., Galway, Ireland.  
 
The TWO [ADDRESS_174048] wound care for acute or 
chronic wounds. It can be placed over a wound on the lower leg and when connected to a 
medical grade oxygen supply ( Wall supply , Oxygen C oncentrator or LOX system) which 
provides oxygen directly to the wound site with a pressure cycling between [ADDRESS_174049] US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance, Health Canada 
clearance and CE -Mark approval for the following indications:  
 
Treatment of acute and chronic wounds on the lower extremity , such as;  
Diabetic u lcers , Venous stasis ulcers , Post-surgical wounds , Gangrenous lesions , 
Decubitus/pressure ulcers , Amputations/infected stumps , Skin grafts , Burns , Frostbite . 
2.3. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The HyperBox Cyclical Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151004] S ystem is a non -invasi ve device that 
has been assessed to provide Non Significant Risk ( NSR ) per FDA guidelines. The device 
offers the same therapy as the predicate system, which has been used in the marketplace for 
over 20 years with  no recorded adverse events. Based on this a ssessment the potential 
benefit of the therapy is expected to exceed any potential risks envisioned.  
2.4. Compliance Statement  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the approved study protocol and ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011 (E) Clinical investigation of medical  devices for human subjects — 
Good clinical practice  as reflected in Good Clinical Practice in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6: “Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guideline,” 62 Federal Register 25,692 (1997) where  and as adopted by [CONTACT_1622] , and 
applicable regulatory requirements. Investigators should conduct the trial in compliance with 
these conditions, agreed to with AOTI, Ltd. and approved by [CONTACT_151050]/Ethics Committee s. Signature [CONTACT_151087] [CONTACT_093](s) and AOTI, Ltd.

3.1. Overview  
This is a multi -center  trial, to be conducted at up to 30 sites in the [LOCATION_002], Canada, 
and Europe . 
 
Inclusion criteria for participation in  the trial include the presence of documented diabetes 
(Type I or II) with non -healing, full -thickness, University of [LOCATION_007] Classification of Diabetic 
Foot Ulcers Grade [ADDRESS_174050] s will be asked to sign  a written  informed consent form, approved by [CONTACT_2717]/Ethics 
Committee , prior to participation in the trial  at the screening study visit . Each subject  will be 
assigned a Subject  Identification Number , which will be used for identification purposes in 
order to ensure subject  confidentiality. All subject  data held on the study Sponsor’s database 
will be anonymised and identifiable only by [CONTACT_151051] . 
 
Those who continue to meet all of the eligibility criteria  after the 2 week run -in period  will be 
enrolled into the trial and randomized to one of two treatment arms: TWO [ADDRESS_174051] s will be recruited . A Group Sequential Designs (GSD)  
with interims analyses after one third and two third recruited subjects has been chosen that 
will allow the trial to be stopped if TWO [ADDRESS_174052] will also function as an alert to other 
providers of participation in a clinical study ( example Appendix I).  
 
After a run -in period of [ADDRESS_174053]  will be randomized into the study if the wound -
size reduction is less than 30% of the initial measurement and all other in clusion  and 
exclusion criteria are met.  
 
All subjects will receive 90 minutes of either TWO 2 therapy or control therapy at their home or 
nursing care facility 5 times a week for the treatment phase of up to 12 weeks. To secure 
double blinding no TWO 2 treatment will be done at the study centers. Delivery, installation 
and training on use of the TW O2 device or control device may differ according to 
geographical location and shall be performed by [CONTACT_151052], or by [CONTACT_151053]/durable medical equipment (DM E) providers and an expert on the TWO2 device or 
control device.  The subject, or in some cases caregiver or healthcare professional (such as 
a home health nurse or aide), applying the TWO 2 therapy or control therapy will be 
adequately trained and assessed  for competency on the use of the device, which will be 
reviewed monthly.  Dressing changes at home (or equivalent) may be performed either by 
[CONTACT_423], caregiver or healthcare professional such as a home health nurse or aide.  Both

(AMWT) dressings, which will be changed at a minimum of once weekly according to the 
PI/Sub Invest igator’s (SubI) clinical judgment. Subjects will receive standardized off -loading  
for a weight bearing wounds  or an open heel boot for posterior heel wounds .  A Charcot 
Restraint Orthotic Walker boot ( CROW boot ) may be used where there is a need to protect  a 
Charcot Foot deformity . Debridement  will be performed as needed according to the PI/SubI 
clinical judgment.  
 
The treatment phase of the study will be 12 weeks. At every on treatment study visit at the 
clinic , foot ulcers are photographed. The initial ( baseline) measurement after debridement will 
serve as the standard. Digital images will be sent to a blinde d central assessor to be 
assessed  and measured . 
 
Once wounds are initially considered closed, that visit will serve as the first of two 
confirmatory visit.  All  subject s will continue treatment for an additional [ADDRESS_174056] s whose wounds are confirmed closed or who finished the treatment phase of 12 
weeks – whichever is sooner - will enter into the post-treatment follow -up phase of 12 and 38 
weeks .  
 
Subjects who are withdrawn by [CONTACT_978]/SubI from the study treatment phase will be asked to 
return for the final week [ADDRESS_174057] care according to the clinician’s recommendation and will be 
asked no t to participate in another wound care trial in this period.

Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, 2016        13 3.3.4.  Justification for Trial Design  
 
The choice of using the “Incidence of complete wound closure” as the primary endpoint is in 
accordance with the recommendation of the FDA document “ Guidance for Industry, Chronic 
Cutaneous Ulcer and Burn Wounds, Developi[INVESTIGATOR_151015] ”.[ADDRESS_174061] in trial design.  
 
Although there are a number of published reports reporting positive results on topic al oxygen 
treatment and diabetic foot ulcers there is no comparative trial so far. In order to overcome 
the uncertainty surrounding the expected benefit, the trial will be undertaken using group 
sequential design (GSD) allowing for interim analysis to be p erformed at intervals during the 
trial recruitment.  
 
For the purposes of standardizing to reduce treatment variability the choice of dressings for 
this trial will be specifically limited .   
 
All “active” dressings will be excluded from the trial. These inc lude: antimicrobial dressings 
containing silver, iodine or Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB), dressings containing 
enzymes, and growth factors (Regranex® or dermal skin substitutes like Apligraf® or 
Dermagraft®).  
 
Adjunctive treatments such as  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), Vacuum assisted closure 
(VAC), Heat therapy, Laser Therapy, Mechanical constant tension, Larval/maggot therapy 
(Biodebridement), Artificial Skin and Electrical stimulation for Tissue Repair (ESTR) are not 
allowed in this study.  
 
No lo cal antimicrobial treatments are allowed in the study. Systemic antibiotic treatment of 
infection will be prescribed according to local standards.  
 
Histological studies in pi[INVESTIGATOR_151016]. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed a stronger 
presence of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) in the tissue from oxygen treated 
wounds in pi[INVESTIGATOR_151017] -treated controls.[ADDRESS_174062] Wound Therapy and the paper 
from Löndahl, 2010 where Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy was evaluated as an adjunctive 
therapy did not exclude infected ulcers. As oxygen is critical to fight infection in chronic 
wounds33-35 and the TWO 2 device has been shown to eliminate infections and multi -resistant 
staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 21,22,36, in this trial wound infections will not be excluded. 
However, any subject with wound infection must be under treatment at the time of 
randomization.

Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174063] on patient well -being and quality of life. In 
this study we aim to examine the efficacy of Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151007] (TWO 2) therapy with 
AMWT in the healing of diabetic foot ulcers and compare th e outcome to that of AMWT  and 
Control  therapy  in a double blind study.  
 
In the event that a subject being considered for study enrollment has multiple diabetic foot 
ulcers, the ulcer to be considered as the index ulcer will be the largest one, which still meets 
all other inclusion criteria ( Index  ulcer).

inclusion/ exclusion criteria  at the [ADDRESS_174065]  will be randomized to one of 
two treatment arms: TWO [ADDRESS_174066]  who has signed a written IRB/Ethics Committee approved  Informed Consent 
Form  will receive a unique subject ID number. The  number will have [ADDRESS_174067] s in this center.  
 
After all baseline medical data is recorded and the wound  is documented at the 2 week 
baseline/randomization  visit, the subject’s number will become the subject identification 
number (Subject ID) for the remainder for the study . The investigator will not know to which 
treatment arm the subject  is allocated throu ghout the trial.  
5.2. Allocation concealment  
Randomization will be coordinated by a central randomization center.  Neither investigator nor 
subject  will know their randomization allocation or can influence their allocation (=allocation 
concealment).

Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174068] of care 
treatment. The TWO 2 treatment consists of the Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151019]  
(AOTI Ltd. ) as well as a n oxygen concentrator. Oxygen will be delivered to the device at a 
flow rate of at least  10 liters/ minute.  
 
After connecting the TWO 2 Single patient -use leg chamber to the controller and concentrator , 
the controller initiates 4 phases of the treatment:  
 
Phase 1:  
The outer leg  chamber is inflated. The limb with the ulcer can then be placed into the 
chamber.   
 
Phase 2:  
The integrated cuff is inflated to seal the inside of the chamber against the limb.  
 
Phase 3:  
The therapy phase: Cyclical pressurized oxygen is delivered to the  limb inside the chamber.  
 
Phase 4:  
The cuff and o uter leg chamber is  deflated  and remove d from subject ’s limb . 
 
 
This setup delivers cyclical pressurized oxygen to the wound site within a sealed and 
humidified environment.  
  
The affected limb will be pl aced in the chamber for 90 minutes daily, 5 days a week, for a

 All centers will perform a standardized training before the trial  
 All centers will be monitored closely by a study site monitor and the study director  
6.3.1.  Debridement  
Adequate debridement is key for wound  healing in diabetic ulcers. All wounds will receive 
baseline sharp s debridement of all callus/necrotic tissu e and additional debridement  as 
needed throughout the trial.  Debridement will be performed where it is determined to be 
clinically necessary by [CONTACT_3433] e PI/SubI.  
 
Any surgical debridement has to be documented on CRFs , reported as an adverse event  and 
will be included in analysis of product safety and efficacy.  
 
Standardized debridement will be part of the Investigators training. To ensure the same 
standard of debridement /wound preparation  in all centers , photographs of all subject s will be 
evaluated by a central assessor . 
 
Enzymatic debrid ement products, like other concomitant topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186], can confound 
results in topi[INVESTIGATOR_151021] -treatment product  trials and therefore must  be prohibited .

7.1. Efficacy Assessment  
7.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Assessment  
 
The primary endpoint is the “ Incidence of complete wound clo sure within 12 weeks”.  
 
Only one ulcer (the index ulcer) will be assessed per subject . In subject s with multiple ulcers, 
this will be the largest ulcer present fulfilling all other inclusion criteria.  
 
Closure is defined as skin re -epi[INVESTIGATOR_151024] 2 consecutive trial visits 2 week s apart.23 
 
Wound closure checks will be performed weekly. The closure of the wound is a clinical 
judgment by [CONTACT_093]. A digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_151025].  
 
Ulcers will be measured by [CONTACT_151056] .   A deidentified digital photograph of the 
ulcer will be taken with and transmitted by [CONTACT_151057] a wifi/wireless enabled tablet 
device . The ulcer’s surface area, circumference, maximum and minimum diameters will be 
recorded at baseline assessment of the subject.   
7.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
 
Time to complete wound closure  
The time (in days) from fi rst treatment at baseline of the ulcer until it closes completely will be 
recorded.  
 
Change in wound size over time  
Ulcer  size over time will be assessed from the digital photograph s of the ulcer  taken at each 
visit.  
 
Incidence of recurrence   
Recurrence is identified as an interruption in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_151026]. If the subject  does have a recurrence, this will be documented and the re -opened 
ulcer will be measured and recorded  
 
Incidence of Amputation   
All amputations will be recorded. The investigator will judge whether the amputation was 
done because of the index ulcer or for different reasons.  
 
Incidence of adverse events and device effects   
 
Quality of Life    
Pain - A Visual Analogue Scale will be used to determine pain levels.  
Mood and Function - The Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule (CWIS) assesses levels 
of mood and function and is the tool used to determine Quality of Life (Appendix I).   
(Subjects in countries where the CWIS has not been validated will b e debriefed on its 
use at the end of the study).    
 
Economic Analysis  
Economic assessments will be determined from the Euroqol -5D (EQ -5D), subject diary and

Cost effectiveness  will be determined by [CONTACT_151058]= Cost of treatmen t (TWO)  - Cost treatment (Control)   
                                  Healed ulcers (TWO) - Healed ulcers (Control)  
Cost Utility will be determined by [CONTACT_151059] (QALYs) associated with the different treatment r egimens and their associated 
costs.  Health utilities will be derived from the EQ -5D tool and used to calculate QALYs 
in each group.  This will be related to overall treatment costs using the following formula  
Incremental cost per QALY = Cost of treatment (TWO) -cost of treatment (control)

mortality.  Known co -morbidities related to diabetes include cardiovascular disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, renal failure and deterio ration of foot ulcers that may require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The study will capture data on adverse events and device effects and serious 
adverse events and device effects related to the study’s secondary outcome measures and 
will also record concomitant medica tion related to these occurrences . Serious adverse 
events that are anticipated in this population do not require expedited reporting, but they will 
be recorded as they may affect the status of subjects in the study. Detailed documentation of 
pharmaceutical  interventions are not required for the safety evaluation of the device, but will 
be recorded where in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439]/SubI they may directly or indirectly relate to the 
index ulcer.  
  
7.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as:  
An AE is: Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device  
NOTE 1 This defi nition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator.  
NOTE 2 This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
NOTE 3 For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investi gational medical devices.  
ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011E (3.2)  
Double Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151006]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174077] (ADE) is defined as:  
An adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device.  
NOTE [ADDRESS_174078] that is a result of user error (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011(E) 
(3.1)).  
7.2.3.  Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as:  
Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death  was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in 
the application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. (CFR 21 Part 812.3(s))  
7.2.4.  Serious Ad verse Device Effect  
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is defined as:  
Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a  
serious adverse event (ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011(E) (3. 36)).  
7.2.5.  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as:  
Any untoward medical occurrence which in any way:  
 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
 is life -threatening  
 results in death or results in persistent or significant 
disab ility/incapacity  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 or is consider ed serious by [CONTACT_093]*  
* Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.   
 
NOTE: The term ‘life -threatening,’ in the definition of ‘serious,’ refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it been more severe.  
7.2.6.  Relationship of Events to Study Treatment  
The causal relationship of each AE to the investigational product will be assessed by [CONTACT_151060] t he following definitions:  
 
Definite  Clear cut temporal association, and no other possible cause.  
Probable  Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal 
relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely but not 
necessarily highly p robable.  
Possible  Sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal relationship 
in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the 
connection is uncertain or doubtful, e.g. due to missing data or

Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174079] administration 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another 
etiology.  
 
7.2.7.  Severity of Events and Effects  
Classifications of the AE severity include the following:  
 
Mild Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of 
minor irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. 
Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs 
and symptoms are transient.  
Moderate  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually 
improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate 
experiences may cause some interference with functioning.  
Severe  interrupt the participant’s normal dail y activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are 
usually incapacitating.   
7.2.8.  Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  
There are no  known  ADEs reported with the use of the TWO2 device .  The following AEs are 
possible secondary o utcomes and must be reported in the CRFs:

 The investigator must notify the IRB/Ethics Committee  of any premature

Trial” form available from the EudraCT/and other relevant website s. 
 AOTI Ltd. will notify the Regulatory Authorities within [ADDRESS_174104] -to-follow -up 
Every effort should be made for all subjects enrolled in this study to complete all study visits

Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, 2016        34 9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
9.1 Sample Size and Power Analysis  
All sample size estimations in this section of the protocol were undertaken using the sampsi 
function in Stata 11 (Statcorp LP, [LOCATION_007], [LOCATION_003]).  Comparisons of groups was made assuming 
no continuity correction.  
 
Little data are available on similar studies u sing topi[INVESTIGATOR_151029]. Large trials of dermal substitutes 
and negative pressure have been undertaken that can be used to indicate the potential 
healing in the control group. The three large trials have control healing of between 18% and 
28.9% around 12 weeks after entering the trial, with a mean of 28%.25,27,[ADDRESS_174106] been few comparative s tudies published. Aburto and Frye undertook a randomized 
study of 20 venous ulcers and 20 diabetic foot ulcer patients. 42 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151030] 90 days of 90% versus 40% in the control group. 
Blackman et al r andomized 28 patients with DFUs and obtained a similar response (82.4% 
versus 45.5%).22 The potential difference between treatment groups was therefore 50% and 
36.9% respectively. Using these studies a total sample size of 28 and 52 would be expected 
based  on 80% power at the 5% level of significance. Neither of these studies was blinded. It 
is therefore likely that the effect is likely to be substantially smaller than that experienced in 
these two studies.  
 
Because of the small size of these trials and la ck of blinding it has been decided to offer a 
more cautious approach to the calculation of sample size based on a smaller expected 
benefit of oxygen therapy. By [CONTACT_151069] a healing rate of 9/21 (42.8%).  In the actively treated 
group healing occurred in 23/27 (85.2%).  Assuming an expected control rate of 43% and a 
difference of half that experienced in these trials of 21% (to 64%) would require a sample 
size of 88 patie nts in each group (total=176), with a power of 80% and a level of significance 
set at p<0.05.  
In order to overcome the uncertainty surrounding the expected benefit, the trial will be 
undertaken using group sequential design (GSD) allowing for interim anal ysis to be 
performed at intervals during the trial recruitment. The interim analysis will take place after 
one third of subjects have been recruited, after two thirds and then a final analysis at full 
recruitment. The Pocock method of interim analysis will  be used, which requires an equal 
level of significance (p<0.022) over the three analyses.43 If the difference in primary outcome 
produces a probability less than this in any of the analyses then the null hypothesis is 
rejected and the alternative hypothes is of a difference in healing has been shown.  In order to 
achieve this level of significance a total of 110 patients need to be recruited to each arm of 
the trial (total=220).   
 
Since all patients will achieve a 12 week end point (healed versus unhealed)  no uprating of 
this sample size will be made to take into consideration patients lost to follow up (see section 
9.2).

Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, 2016        35 9.2 General  Statistical Methods  
Analysis Populations  
Two analysis populations will be evaluated: Intent To Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol  
(PP). The ITT population will be considered the primary population of interest and  
will include all subjects who were randomized to study treatment. The PP population will 
include all subjects who were randomized to study treatment and had no significant pr otocol 
violations that might affect the outcome of treatment.  
 
All participants will be followed up to the primary end point (12 weeks) irrespective of whether 
they were on active treatment. Participants that withdraw from treatment continue to be 
followed up to the [ADDRESS_174107] to follow up will be considered as treatment failures.  
 
Continuous demographic variables (age, ulcer duration, etc. ) will be summarized for the 
study population  as descriptive statistics (number, mean, median, SD, minimum and 
maximum value) , and by [CONTACT_151070]. No formal inferential statistical testing will take 
place of baseline values in relation to randomized groups.  
 
Categorical demographic variables, s uch as gender , will be summarized as a proportion of 
the intention -to-treat population .  
 
All analyses will be undertaken using the STATA 11 statistical package.  
9.3 Primary outcome analysis  
The primary endpoint is the “Incidence of complete wound closure wit hin 12 weeks”.  
 
The null hypothesis to be tested is that there is no difference between treatment groups in 
terms of the rate of wound healing after 12 weeks of study treatment. The alternative 
hypothesis is that such a difference exists.   
 
Uncorrected Chi  squared analyses will be used to determine  the difference between 
treatment groups in terms of wound closure rate within 12 weeks, at the interim analysis. 
95% confidence intervals will be estimated using the normal approximation interval.  
 
Logistic regre ssion analysis will be used to determine the effects of confounding on the 
primary outcome at the trial end. In particular, gender, age, ulcer duration, size and diabetic 
factors will be considered in the model. A stepwise procedure will be used to elimina te non -
significant covariates from the model.  The effect of different centers’ outcomes will be 
entered as a random effect into the model.  
9.4 Secondary outcome analyses  
9.4.1  Time to complete wound closure  
The analysis will use the Cox proportional hazards model  to determine time to event 
(healing). Subject s who withdraw from treatment will be entered into the analysis and 
censored at the time they withdraw from the trial or are lost to follow up. The analysis will 
consider covariates that might influence the out come in the trial. Factors considered 
potentially important in predicting the outcome of treatment will be tested in a Cox model. 
Stepwise el imination of non significant co variates will be undertaken and only those 
covariates that remain statistically sign ificant will be retained in the model.  Tests of 
proportionality will be undertaken using graphical (Nelson Aalen) and quantitative methods 
(Schoenfeld test). The data will be presented graphically using Kaplan Meier graphs. The

confidence intervals and p -values generated from the model.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_174109] be taken to choose an appropriate measure 
for this outcome, as measures such as reduction in area or percentage reduction in area 
usually lead to biased comparisons. It is proposed that the trial uses the linear healing 
measure of Gowland -Hopkins & Jamieson44 and described in Gilman45. This measure is 
defined as:  
 
d = ΔA/p avg   
 
where ΔA is the change in wound area between two successive visits and p avg is the average 
of the wound perimeters measured at these two visits.  ‘d’ will be calculated weekly after 
randomization to treatment.  
 
Comparisons of the two treatment groups will be carried out in terms of d, at each of these 
assessments. An unpaired t test will be carried out at each assessment, to test the 
hypothesis tha t the treatment groups do not differ in terms of d, against the alternative 
hypothesis that the treatment groups differ in terms of d.   A 95% confidence interval for the 
difference between treatment groups in terms of ‘d’ will be calculated, based on the t test 
results.  
9.4.3  Wound recurrence rate.  
The wound recurrence rates will be analyzed with a time to event strategy as  in 9.4.1.  
9.4.4  Incidence of amputation  
Fisher’s Exact Test will be used . An approximate  95% confidence interval for the difference 
between treatm ent groups in terms of amputation  rate will be estimated using the normal 
approximation interval .

In many cases TWO 2 has been shown to be particularly effective in severe wounds of 
multimorbid patients. Diabetic patients frequently suffer from ischemia, renal insufficiency or 
more severe wounds. A significant fraction of these patients use corticosteroids for other 
chronic diseases.  
 
Due to the low chance of healing, a high mortality, and other reasons such as reimbursement 
issues these patients are normally excluded from clinical trials. However, as these patients 
represent an increasing percentage of all patients with diabetic ulcers we shall also include a 
sub study with high risk patients. In this sub study 24 patients will be randomized to either the 
active or the control group.  
 
All procedures and outcomes will be the same as in the main arm of the study except for  two 
differences:  
 No biopsies will be taken  
 Different inclusion and exclusion criteria  
 
12.1 Inclusion and exclusion corollary substudy  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria remain the same as in the main study population except  
the ones stated below :

 ALL University of [LOCATION_007] Grades allowed   (Grade 1 and 2 in the main study)  
 ABI can be as low as 0.5    (0.7 in the main study)  
 May have osteomyelitis   (excluded in the main study)  
 May have exposed bone  (excluded in the main study)  
 Subject may require  renal  dialyses  (excluded in the main study)  
 Subject may use chronic steroids  (excluded in the main study)

WMA Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving 
Human Subjects  
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964  
and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_174145] WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], October 2002 (Note of Clarification 
added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
 
Preamble  
1.         The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as 
a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
            The Declaration is intended to be read a s a whole and each of its constituent 
paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2.         Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who a re involved in medical research involving 
human subjects to adopt these principles.   
General Principles  
3.         The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The 
health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the I nternational Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing 
medical care.”  
4.         It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and 
rights of patients, includ ing those who are involved in medical research. The physician's 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
5.         Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.  
Double Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151006]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, 2016        54 6.         The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand 
the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, 
efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7.         Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and prot ect their health and rights.  
8.         While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this 
goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9.         It is the duty of physicians w ho are involved in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects 
must alw ays rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the 
research subjects, even though they have given consent.  
10.       Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international 
norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement 
should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this 
Declara tion. 
11.       Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the 
environment.  
12.       Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_151083] , training and qualifications. Research on 
patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately 
qualified physician or other health care professional.  
13.       Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should  be provided appropriate 
access to participation in research.  
14.       Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their 
patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by [CONTACT_151084], 
diagnostic or  therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that 
participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who 
serve as research subjects.  
15.       Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects w ho are harmed as a result of 
participating in research must be ensured.  
Risks, Burdens and Benefits   
16.       In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and 
burdens.  
Double Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151006]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174146], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating 
and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the 
research study.  
Double Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151006]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174147] submit a final 
report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findi ngs and conclusions.   
Privacy and Confidentiality   
24.       Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information.  
Informed Consent   
25.       Participation by [CONTACT_54126]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or 
community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a 
research study unless he or s he freely agrees.  
26.       In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, 
each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, 
any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affi liations of the researcher, the anticipated 
benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions 
and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the 
right to refuse to part icipate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time 
without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of 
individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information.  
           After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician 
or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, 
the non -written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.        
           All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the 
general outcome and results of the study.  
27.       When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician 
must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the 
Double Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151006]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174148]’s dissent should be respected.  
30.       Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of  giving 
consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental 
condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the 
research   group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed cons ent from the 
legally authorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific 
reasons for involving subjects with a condition that ren ders them unable to give informed 
consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a 
research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as 
possible from the subject or a legally authori sed representative.  
31.       The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to 
the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32.       For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent for its collectio n, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where 
consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations 
the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics 
committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33.       The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
           Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is 
acceptable; or  
           Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to deter mine the efficacy or safety of an intervention   
Double Blind Topi[INVESTIGATOR_151006]  - AOTI Ltd.,  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 013.0 ; Amendment 8, September 24, [ADDRESS_174149] been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, 
with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an 
unproven intervention  if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -
establishing health or alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the 
object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new informati on 
must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

healthy  non-pregnant women aged 18- [ADDRESS_1153830] 
trimester of pregnancy  to prevent respi[INVESTIGATOR_831327] 
(RSV) associated lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826] (L RTI) in 
infants by  [CONTACT_831378].
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale fo r the stud y:
The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the safet y, 
reactogenicity  and immunogenicity  of three dose levels 
(30µg, 60 µg and 120 µg )of the investigational RSV 
maternal vaccine antigen compared to placebo administered as 
a single intramuscula r injection .
Rationale for the stud y design :
To assess the impact of the investigational RSV m aternal 
vaccine in terms of safety, reactogenicity  and immune 
response, four treatment groups will be evaluated.
Health y, non -pregnant women aged 18 - 45 years will be 
enrolled, a population of the same gender and age of the 
vaccine’s ta rget population
Rationale for the use of placebo :
The placebo group is included as a control for both the 
safet y/reactogenicit y and the immunogenicit y assessments.
Objective(s) Primary
To evaluate the safet y and reactogenicity  of three dose 
levels (30, 60, 120 µg) of the RSV maternal 
investigational vaccine administered as a single 
intramuscular injection, as compared to placebo up to [ADDRESS_1153831] vaccination (Day  31).
Secon dary
To evaluate the safet y of three dose levels (30, 60, 120
µg) of the RSV maternal investigational vaccine 
compared to placebo up to [ADDRESS_1153832] vaccination 
(Day  181).

Protoco l Final Version [ADDRESS_1153834] time that the RSV maternal vaccine will 
be administered in humans, the study  will enrol subjects in two 
steps ( Step 1 will enroll 60 subjects in the [LOCATION_002] [US] 
only and Step 2 will enroll 440 subjects across multiple 
countries ). Subjects will be randomised to all dose levels from 
the start .Both blinded and unblinded safet y monit oring will be 
performed , as described below .
The Safet y Review Team (SRT) will review blinded data on a 
regular basis throughout the study , and an internal Safety  
Review Committee (iS RC) will review unblinded data at 
specific stud y timepoints. (Refer to section[s] 8.10.1 and 8.10.2 
for more details on the safety  monitoring for this study ). 
During Step 1, until the first [ADDRESS_1153835] been vaccinated, 
vaccination will be limited to 10 subjects/ per day across all 
sites. These subjects will be vaccinated sequentially and at least 
60 minutes apart. 
Subsequent vaccinations will continue without limit
ation to the 
number of subjects vaccinated per day  or time lag between 
vaccination of c onsecutive subjects. 
Screening and enrolm ent of Step 2 subjects will only  be 
initiated if the iSRC review of Day  31 data results in a 
recommendation to proceed with Step 2.
Number of subjects Approximately  500 healthy  women will be enrolle d 
(~125/group).
Endpoint(s) Primary
Occurrence of an y adverse events (AEs) from vaccination 
during a 30- day follow -up period, for all subjects in all 
groups:
Occurrence of each solicited local and general 
symptom during a 7-day follow -up period.
Occurrence of an y unsolicited AE during a 3 0-day 
follow -up period.
Occurrence of Serious AEs during a 3 0-day follow -

trial):Active phase is defined as the time period in a clinical 
trial during which all study  visits involving the main 
study  activities (e.g. vaccination or study medication/
product administration; main blood collection) take 
place; this excludes follow-up periods aimed at 
monitoring the safety  of a subject over a long period of 
time or checking long -term immunity  persistence.
Adequate contraception: Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per y ear when 
used consistently  and correctl y and when applicable, in 
accordance with the product label for example:

13-AUG -2018 24Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product. 
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any  unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product. For marketed medicinal products, this also 
includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of 
efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study  outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the 
trial, and only  when the data are cleaned to an acceptable 
level of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded 
or when required in case of a serious adverse event. I n an 
observer -blind study , the subject and the site and sponsor 
personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
subjects are blinded while other stud y personnel may be 
aware of the treatment assignment (see Section 5.3for 
details on observer -blinded studies). The method of 
blinding in this study is further defined in S ection 1.5.6
.
Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Enrolment : Enrolment is defined as the point that a subject is 
determined as eligible to participate in the stud y and has 
been randomized to a treatment group.
End of Study:
(Synonym of End of 
Trial) :For studies without collection of human biologicals 
samples or imaging data EoS is the L ast Subject Last 
Visit (L SLV). For studies with collection of Human 
Biologicals Samples or imaging data, EoS is defined as 
the date of the last testing/reading released of the Human 
Biological Samples or imaging data, related to primary  
and secondary  endpoints or LSLV, whichever comes 
later. EoS must be achieved no later than 8 months after 
LSLV.

13-AUG -2018 291. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
RSV is a negative -strand, ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of which two antigenically  
distinct subgroups exist, referred to as RSV -A and RSV -B. RSV is a highl y contagious 
human pathogen that causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_831333]. I n tempera te 
climates throughout the world, RSV predictabl y causes fall -winter epi[INVESTIGATOR_831334].
The virus causes respi[INVESTIGATOR_831335], but y oung infant s below [ADDRESS_1153858] incidence of severe disease (b ronchiolitis, pneumonia), peaking at 1 -
3 months of age [Hall, 2013] and with a continuing burden of disease through the second 
year of life [ EMA /CHMP , 2017]. Sev
ere disease often leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831336]. The majority  ofchildren become infected with RSV within 2 y ears of 
birth [Hall2001; Nyiro
,2017 ; Kutsay a, 2016 ].The impact continues into later life, 
specificall y, epi[INVESTIGATOR_831337] [Wu, 2011].
The risk for severe RSV -induced lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_831338] [ADDRESS_1153859] common cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831339]. About 45% of the estimated 3.2 million hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831340] –associated 
acute lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_831341] 2015, occurred in infants 
younger than 6 months of age . Additionall y, it was estimated globall y that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831342] -associated lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_831343]  59,600 in children 
younger than 5 y ears and 27, 300 in children < 6 months of age [Shi, 2017].
Approximately  2% of children < [ADDRESS_1153860] infections each year in industrialized countries [Blais , 2017; Boyce, 
2000; Deshpande , 2003; Hall, 2009; Holman, 2004; Iwane, 2004; Madhi , 200 6; Nair, 
2010; Paramore , 2004; Vicente ,2003; Shi,2017; Stein , 2017
].
Previous infection with RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Re -infection with 
RSV occurs throughout an individual’s lifetime [Simoes , 1999; Kapi[INVESTIGATOR_327859], 1969; 
Krilov, 
2011]. These re -infections generall y go undiagnosed because they  usuall y present as 
common acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115]. In more vulnerable populations ( e.g.,
immunocompromised individuals or older adults), re -infections can also lead to severe 
disease and result in  mortality  [Graham , 2011].
1.2. Current Management of RSV Disease in Infants
To date, no 
licensed vaccine is available for RSV and treatment for RSV disease is 
limited to supportive care .Palivizumab (Synagis , 
MedI mmune), an RSV
specific -recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody , is indicated for the prevention of 
severe LRT I requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831344], such as infants who were born prematurely  or with bronc hopulmonary  dysplasia ,

1.3. Maternal Immunization
Maternal immunization, and the protective effect of maternall y transferred antibodie s was 
initially  demonstrated with the small pox vaccination in 1879 [Rasmussen, 2014]. 
Effective immune responses to vaccines and transmission of spe cific antibodies to infants 
through the placenta are observed when pregnant women are vaccinated [Vojtek, 2018]
. 
Currently , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends the 
inactivated influenza and Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular 
pertussis) vaccines for pregnant women [CDC , 2017]. 
In a study  evaluating maternal vaccination with influenza, there was a 63% reduction in 
laboratory  proven influenza illness in infants up to 6 months of age and 29 %and 36% 
reductions in rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_831345], re spectivel y 
[Zaman , 2008]. Additionally , in a retrospective cohort study , it was concluded that 
infants with pertussis whose mothers received Tdap during pregna ncy had a significantly  
lower risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831346] s 
[Winter ,
2017]. Following maternal tetanus toxoid vaccination, neonatal tetanus mortality  
has been reduced b y 92% in combination with improved h ygienic birthing practices 
[Healy ,
2012]. 
Based on the results seen with previous maternal vaccines, vaccinating mothers with an 
RSV vaccine could reduce RSV
-associated morbidity  and mortalit yin infants less than [ADDRESS_1153862] of the RSV neutralizing acti vity present in serum from previously  
infected individuals is directed to the pre -fusion conformation of RSV F protein 
[Ngwuta , 2015]
. In addition, antibodies specific for the RSV F pre- fusion conformation 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y more potent than those which are common to both the post -and pre -fusion 
forms [ Kwakkenbos ,2010 ]
.
Administration of an RSV vaccine to adults (pregnant women in this case), all of whom 
can be assumed to have been naturally  infected with RSV before, is expected to boost the 
immunological memory  induced by  [CONTACT_831381] [ Anderson , 2013 ].High 
titers of maternall y derived RSV -neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be 
associated with subsequent sero logic protection against RSV infection and lower 
incidence of RSV -associated acute lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_831347] 6 
months of life [ Roca ,2002; Stensballe ,2009; Chu, 2014].
Enhanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_23715] (ERD) was seen in clinical trials of a formalin- inactivated 
whole virus RSV vaccine (FI- RSV) in seronegative children. Among seronegative 
children in th osetrials, the FI -RSV vacc ine did not protect against RSV disease and more 
importantly  led to more severe clinical s ymptoms upon subsequent natural infection of 
RSV [ Chin ,1969; Kapi[INVESTIGATOR_327859] ,1969; Kim,1969]. I n contrast, clinical data demonstrate a

Protoco l Final Version [ADDRESS_1153863] in the seropositive children who participated in the FI -RSV 
studies [ Roberts , 2016].  With the transfer of vaccine- induced neutralizing antibodies 
from the mother to the infant, the risk of ERD in the infants is considered negligible. In 
support of this hy pothesis, ERD has not been observed with the use of Synagis , nor with 
the transfer of serum from FI -RSV vaccinated animals to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_831348] [ Kwon ,

maternal v accine
The RSV maternal v accine is composed of the l yophilized RSVPreF3 antigen (Refer to 
the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) Dossier and Section 3.2.S.1.2 of the 
Investigational New Drug (IND
). The vaccine is being developed for prevention of RSV 
LRTI disease in infants by [CONTACT_831378].

1.5. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.5.1. Rationale for the study
[COMPANY_004] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new investigational RSV maternal vaccine against RSV disease in 
infants through a maternal immunization program.
The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the safet y, reactogenicity and immunogenicity  of 
three dose levels ( 30 µg, 60 µg and 120 µg )of the investigational RSV maternal vaccine 
antigen compared to placebo administered as a single intramuscular injection.
1.5.2. Rationale for the study  design
To assess the impact of the investigational RSV m aternal vaccine in terms of safet y, 
reactogenicity  and immune response, four treatment groups will be evaluated:
Group Name (Product):
RSV MAT 30 (RSVPreF3 30µg)
RSV MAT 60 (RSVPreF3 60µg)
RSV MAT 120 (RSVPreF3 120µg)
Control ( Saline Placebo )
Health y, non -pregnant women aged 18 - 45 years will be enrolled in this study , a 
population of the same gender and age of the vaccine’s ta rget population .

13-AUG -2018 321.5.3. Rationale for dose selection
[COMPANY_004] previously  evaluated a different candidate RSV m aternal vaccine at dose levels of 
30, 60, and 120 µg ina similar population, non- pregnant women 18- 45 years of age. 
Building on this experience, the RSV MAT- 001 study  will evaluate 3 dose levels (30, 60 
or 120 µg) of the new inves tigational unadjuvanted RSV maternal vaccine administered 
intramuscularl y as a single dose. Clinical experience with the previousl y evaluated 
vaccine candidate indicated that unadjuvanted formulations induced Nab levels similar to 
those of alum -adjuvanted formulations in adults [ Langley , 2017; Beran , 2018 ]. Therefore, 
only unadjuvanted formulations will be used in RSV MAT-001.
The highest propo sed dose level (120 µg) for RSV MAT
-[ADDRESS_1153864] is randomised. 
1.5.4. Rationale for the use of placebo
The placebo group is included as a control for both the safet y/reactogenicity  and the 
immunogenicit y assessments.
1.5.5. Safety  considerations
As this will be the first time that the [COMPANY_004] investigational RSV maternal vaccine will be
administered in humans, the study  will enrol subjects in 2 steps with randomisation to all 
dose levels (30, 60 and 120 µg) from the start ,(See Figure 1). Step 1 (~ 60 subjects) will 
be conducted at sites in the [LOCATION_002] only and additional countries will be added in 
Step [ADDRESS_1153865] monitoring .

1.5.6. Study blinding
Given the different presentation of the placebo and the investigational RSV vaccine , a 
double -blinded study  design is not possible. This study  will be conducted in an observer -
blind manner up to Day  9
1, after which it will be conducted in a single -blind manner .
Observer -blind, means that during the course of the study , the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] , those 
responsible for the evaluation of an y study endpoint (e.g. safety and reactogenicity ), and 
the sponsor will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine 
preparation and administration will be done b y authori sed medical personnel who will not 
participate in an y of the study  clinical evaluation assay s.
Single -blind, means that [COMPANY_004] sta tistician and data management staff will be unblinded 
(i.e. will have access to the individual subject treatment assignments), but individual 
listings will not be provided until the study  report at the completion of the study .In 
addition, site staff invol ved in the clinical evaluation of study participants will not be 
aware of individual treatment assignments until the study report.
Please refer to Section 5.3for further details regarding the methods of blinding used in 
this study .

Risks, Contraindications and 
WarningsData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
All Study Vaccines
Hypersensitivity including 
allergic reaction ssuch as 
anaphylaxisAcute allergic reactions ,such as an 
anaphylactic event ,may occur with 
any vaccine administration. These are 
serious, but rare occurrences,
estimated in the range of 1 to 10 
cases per million of vaccinations, 
depending on the vaccine studied 
[Ruegge berg, 2007].The onset of vaccine -related 
allergic symptoms is typi[INVESTIGATOR_831349]. In order to treat 
subjects with a serious allergic 
reaction to vaccination, all 
subjects will need to remai n 
under observation ( i.e.visibly 
followed; no specific 
procedure) at the vaccination 
centre for at least 60minutes 
after vaccination with 
appropriate medical treatment 
readily available, in case 
needed .
Syncope Syncope (fainting) can occur following 
or even before any vaccination as a 
psychogenic or vasovagal response to 
the needle injection. All subjects will remain under 
observation at the vaccination 
centre for at least 60minutes 
after vaccination.
Intramuscular Injection site 
reactionIntramuscular vaccination commonly 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] a transient and self -
limiting local inflammatory reaction. 
This may typi[INVESTIGATOR_831350], redness, and swelling .Solicited local AEs will be 
collected and reviewed up to [ADDRESS_1153868] -vaccination

Due to the lack of experience in 
human subjects to date, there 
is currently not enough 
information available to identify 
the risks of adverse events 
(AE) related to administration 
of the RSV m aternal vaccineAny untoward symptoms 
experienced by [CONTACT_831384] . Ongoing safety
monitoring will be performed in 
a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_831385], and unblinded 
review will be performed by [CONTACT_831386] (independent from

1.6.2. Benefit A ssessment
Benefits linked to the investigational RSV m aternal vaccine
RSV infections in healthy adults generall y go undiagnosed because they  usually  present 
asmild acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115]. Moreover, vaccine efficacy has not been 
assessed yet and it is not known whether the investigational RSV maternal vacci ne is
effective in protecting against RSV infection in infants.
As the proposed indication of the vaccine is to prevent RSV -associated lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_831352] (L RTI) in infants by  [CONTACT_831378], the subjects in RSV 
MAT- 001 (health y, non -pregnant women) receiving the investigational RSV maternal
vaccine are not expected to directly  benefit from this vaccination .
1.6.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
This is a FTiH study  evaluating aninvestigational RSV maternal vaccine. The 
investigatio nal RSV m aternal vaccine is currentl y in an earl y stage of clinical 
development and although no vaccine efficacy  has been demonstrated, the vaccine has 
been shown to boost Nab to both RSV seroty pe A and RSV seroty pe B in animal models
(refer to the IB).

5. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY
5.1. Regulatory  and ethical considerations, including the 
informed consent process
The study  will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements.
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the I CH Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP), all applicable subject privacy  requirements and the guiding principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki.
[COMPANY_004] will obtain favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval to conduct the study  from the appropriate 
regulatory  agency , in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements, prior to a site 
initiating the study  in that country .
Conduct of the study  includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and 
favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval of study  protocol and any  subsequent amendments.
Subject informed consent .
Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol.
[COMPANY_004] will provide full details of the a bove procedures to the investigator, either verbally , 
in writing, or both.
Freely  given and written or witnessed/ thumb printed informed consent must be obtained 
from each subject as appropriate, prior to participation in the study .
[COMPANY_004] will prepare a mode l Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody  the ICH 
GCP and [COMPANY_004] required elements. While it is strongl
y recommended that this model I CF 
is to be followed as closely  as possible, the informed consent requirements given in this 
document are not intended to pre -empt an y local regulations which require additional 
information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y effective. Clinical 
judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final structure and 
content of the local version of the ICF.
The investigator has the final responsibility for the final presentation of the ICF, 
respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF generated b y the 
investigator with the assistance of the sponsor’s representative must be acc eptable to

5.2. Subject identification and randomisation
5.2.1. Subject identification
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially  to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study  centre .
In order to allow for proper control of recruitment as per the Step 1 and Step 2 
recruitment targets, consented subjects w ill be registered in the SBIR application . 
5.2.2. Randomisation of treatment
[IP_ADDRESS]. Randomisation of supplies
The randomisation of supplies within blocks will be performed at G SK, using MATerial 
EXcellence ( MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Analy sis System 
(SAS®) (Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]) by  [CONTACT_23983]. Entire blocks will be shipped to the study  centres/ 
warehouse(s).
To allow [COMPANY_004] to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than anticipated at 
individual centres in this multi -centre study  and to thus reduce the overall study  
recruitment period, an over- randomisation of supplies will be pr epared.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment allocation to the subject
The treatment numbers will be allocated b y dose.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target will be to enrol approximately  500 eligible subjects who will be randomly  
assigned to four stud y groups in a (1: 1: 1: 1) ratio ( ~125 subjects in each group).
Allocation of each subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed
using SBIR . The randomisation algorithm will use a minimisation procedure accounting 
for age (18 - 32 years or 33 
-45 years) and centre. Minimisation factors will have equal 
weight in the minimisation algorithm.
At Visit 1, after having fully  checked the eligibility  of the subject, the site staff in charge 
of the vaccine administration will access SBIR. Upon selecting the subject identification 
number previousl y entered in the application ,the randomisation sy stem will determine 
the study  group and will provide the treatment number to be used for vaccination .

Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, develop ment and quality  assurance of the laboratory  tests 
described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality  of th ese 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be asked to give a specific consent 
to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future 
research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and 
will only  be performed once an independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has 
approved this research.

The investig ator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and 
reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol. 
Each subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_43054] y should they/the 
subject manifest an y signs or sy mptoms they  perceive as serious.
8.1. Safet y definitions
8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) tempo rally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Examples of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine administration 
even though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational vaccine or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).
Signs, s ymptoms temporally  associated with vaccine(s) administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e.invasive procedures, modificatio n of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be reco rded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.

13-AUG -2018 62Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures ( e.g.endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( e.g.social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
study  vaccination. These events will be record ed in the medi cal history  section of the 
eCRF.
8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],
Note: I n general , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599657]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_301877]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599658], the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be c onsidered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31782] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, inf luenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study  subject.
Medical or sci entific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_831356] y require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other

8.2. Events or outcomes not qualify ing as adverse events or 
serious adverse events (pregnancy )
Female subjects who become pregnant after the vaccination may  continue the study  at the
discretion of t he investigator, but will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . 
While pregnancy  itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any  adverse pregnancy  outcome 
or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy  for medical reasons will be 
record ed and reported as an AE or a SAE.
Note: The pregnancy  itself should alway s be recorded on an electronic pregnancy  report.
The following should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in 
Sections 8.4.1 and8.4.3:
Spontaneous pregnancy  loss, including:
spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy  loss bef ore/at 22 weeks of 
gestation)
ectopic and molar pregnancy
stillbirth (intrauterine death of foetus after 22 weeks of gestation).
Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the 
EMA Guideline on pregnancy  exposure [ EMA , 2017]. It is recogniz ed that national 
regulations might be different.
Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 
days of life). 
Any congenital anomal y or birth defect (as per [ CDC MACDP ]guidelines) 
identified in the offspring of a study  subject (either during pregnancy , at birth or 
later) regardless of whe ther the foetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes 
anomalies identified by [CONTACT_301944], amniocentesis or examination of the 
products of conception after elective or spontaneous abortion.
Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -
study pregnancy  AND considered 
by [CONTACT_43074] y related to the investigational vaccines will be 
reported to [COMPANY_004] as described in Section 8.4.3. Wh ile the investigator is not obligated to

events
As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as: ‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine(s )or 
since the previous visit? ’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory  and diagnostics reports) relatedto 
the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE 
in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] instead of appropriately completing the eCRF . However, there may  be 
instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_63475] b y[COMPANY_004]. I n this 
instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_831357].

1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which preven ts normal, every day activities. Such an AE 
would, for example, prevent attendance at work/school and would 
necessitate the administra tion of corrective therapy .
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ w hen it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the rel ationship between investigational vaccines 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to 
determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history  of the 
underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy ,other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the investigational vaccines will be considered and 
investigated. The inv estigator will also consult the IB to determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004]. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always makes an assessment of causality  for every  event prior to submission 
of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004]. The investigator may change his/her 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_831358] -up information and update the SAE information 
accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory  reporting requirements.
In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines , it may  not be possible to 
determine the causal relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccine administered. 
The investigator should, therefore, assess whether the AE could be causall y related to 
vacci nation rather than to the individual vaccines .
All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causall y related to 
vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by [CONTACT_159290]: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_387238]?
YES :There is a reasonable possibility  that the study  vaccination contributed to the 
AE.
NO
: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to study  
vaccination. There are other, more likel y causes and study vaccination is not 
suspected to have contributed to the AE.

8.5.1. Follow -up during the study
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to [COMPANY_004] 
(within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 17).
All AEs/SAEs documented at a previous visit and designated as either on-going ,not 
recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits until 
the end of the study .
8.5.2. Follow -up after the subject is discharged from the study
The investigator wi ll follow subjects with SAEs, or subjects withdrawn from the study  as 
a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until 
the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to [COMPANY_004] using a paper/ electronic Expedited Adverse 
Events Report and/or pregnancy  report as applicable.
[COMPANY_004] may  request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of additional 
clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as full y as possible the nature 
and/or causality  of the AE or SAE. The in vestigator is obliged to assist. If a subject dies 
during participation in the study  or during a recognised follow -up period, [COMPANY_004] will be 
provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including histopathology.
8.5.3. Follow -up of pregnancies
Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . At the end 
of the pregnancy , whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother 
and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004] using the electronic pregnancy  report and the 
Expedited Adv
erse Events Report if applicable. Generall y, the follow -up period does not
need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery.
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it should alway s be reported as aSAE.
8.6. Treatment of adverse events
Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice. Any  medication administered for the treatment of an AE should 
be recorded in the subject’s eCRF (refer to Section 6.6)

[COMPANY_004]’s policy (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial Directive and 
US Federal Regulations) is to unblind the report of any SAE which is unexpected and attributable/suspected to be attributable to the investigational vaccines, prior to regulatory reporting. The [COMPANY_004]’s Central Safety Physician is responsible for unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with the specified timeframes for expedited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 8.4.1 ).
8.8. Emergency unblinding
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in the case of a 
medical emergency, or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged by [CONTACT_093].
The emergency unblinding process consists of the automated system SBIR that allows the 
investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to the subject’s individual study treatment.
The investigator has the option of contact[CONTACT_30697] a [COMPANY_004] On-call Central Safety Physician (or 
Backup) if he/she needs medical advice or needs the support of [COMPANY_004] to perform the unblinding (i.e. he/she cannot access SBIR).
Any emergency unblinding must be fully documented by [CONTACT_43086], which must be appropriately completed by [CONTACT_43087] 24 hours to [COMPANY_004].

In addition to the existi ng SRT, unblinded safet y evaluation swill be performed by  [CONTACT_831397] . The SRT will inform the iSRC about any  
potential safet y concern relevant to the study and vice versa.
8.10.2. Internal Safety  Rev iew Committee (iSRC) Evaluation
As this will be the first time that the RSV maternal vaccine will be administered in 
humans, the study  will enrol subjects in two steps with randomi sation to all dose levels
from the start (see also Figure 1). Safety monit oring will be performed by [CONTACT_831398], 
authorised b y the [COMPANY_004]’s Vaccine sSafet y Monitoring Board (VSMB), and holding rules 
have been established to ensure thesafet y of the subjects in the study .
The iSRC will include the following [COMPANY_004] personnel: a Safet y Physician (Vaccines 
Clinical Safety  andPharmacovigilance representative), a Clinician (CEPL  or CRDL ), and 
a Statistician , all external to the study /project and with no conflicts of interest in the 
outcome of the stud y. The [COMPANY_004] Safet y Physician will act as the Chair of the iSRC. 
Additionally , the iSRC will have (a)ad hoc , non -voting member (s): (an)independent

In addition to the above planned iSRC evaluations, ad hoc iSRC reviews can be 
organ ized, as deemed necessary  at any  time during the study .
During the planned (and any ad-hoc , if applicable) iSRC safety  evaluations, the iSRC 
will review all available safet y data in an unblinded manner, while taking into account 
any other findings that cou ld have an impact on the safet y of the subjects , and will 
determine whether there is a safet y signal or not.
Favourable outcome of the safet y reviews will be documented and provided in writing to 
the RSV study  team and investigator(s). 
If a safet y signal is observed during the planned safet y evaluations or during ad hoc
reviews , the iSRC Chai ris responsible for urgent communication and escalation of the 
concern to the [COMPANY_004]’ sChief Medical Officer (CMO), who may  choose to involve the 
VSMB or VSMB sub -team, and will communicat e the outcome to the study team. The 
CMO will then decide during an ad hoc meeting whether to suspend, modify  or continue 
the conduct of the stud y. 
Alread y vaccinated subjects will continue with all planned visits, including the capture of 
all safet y data. However, further enrolment/vaccination cannot proceed until CMO (with 
or without the involvement of VSMB )review and corresponding outcome is available.
The decision of the G SK’s iSRC will be documented and provided in writing to the 
Primary  Contact [INVESTIGATOR_25810]  (study  CRDL) who will e nsure further communication of 
the outcome to investigator(s). Ethics Committees and Competent Authorities will also be 
notified, as applicable .

From an anal ysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  refers to any  subject who 
is 
not available for Contact 1 at Day 181 foreseen in the protocol.
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact [CONTACT_43092].
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.

period, for all subjects in all groups:
Occurrence of each solicited local and general s ymptom during a 7-day 
follow -up period.
Occurrence of an y unsolicited AE during a 3 0-day follow -up period.
Occurrence of Ser ious AEs during a 30- day follow -up period.

Eosinophils, Haemoglobin, Platelets) and biochemical (alanine aminotransferase 
[ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], creatinine, blood urea nitrogen 
[BUN]) laboratory  abnormalities at Day  8 and Day  31.
10.2. Secondary  endpoints
Occurrence of SAEs from vaccination up to Day  91 and up to Day 181 for all 
subjects, in all groups.
Humoral immune response to the investigational vaccine at Day  8, Day  31, Day  61 
and Day  91 for all subjects in each investigational RSV vaccine group
RSV -A neutralising antibody (Nab) titres
RSVPreF3 IgG antibod y concentrations
10.3. Tertiary  endpoints
Additional humoral response which may  include but not limited to, RSVPreF3 specific 
IgG1 subclass antibod y concentrations, RSV -B neutralising antibody  titres, antibody  
competing for binding to specific epi[INVESTIGATOR_831359]3 and antibody  concentrations to 
residual host cell proteins in the RSVPreF3 vaccines
10.4. Determination of sample size
This section provides justification of sample size in terms of safety  and immunogenicit y. 
Table 
19illustrates the precision with exact 95% confidence interval on the percentage of 
subjects with AEs following vaccination with 125subjects per group. If an AE is not 
observed in a given treatment group, we are 95% confident that the true incidence rate of 
an AE is less than or equal to 2.9
%, in the treatment group. Furthermore, a sample size of 
125 subjects per group provides a probability  of 80% or 90% to observe at least one AE 
if the true incidence rate is 1.3% or 1.8% respectively .

Based on the results of Day  [ADDRESS_1153919] 
deviation (SD) of RSV -A Nab titre is approximately 0.4 on its log10 transformation. 
Table 20 (below) presents the precision estimation on fold increases in RSV -A Nab titres 
between two investigational RSV vaccine dos e groups, when the sample size is [ADDRESS_1153920] s/group, with a range of SD 0.3
-0.5 and 95% confidence interval for assumed fold 
increases of 1.3-2.
Assuming a 2 -fold increase of RSV -A Nab between the high and low dose groups, with 
125 subjects per group, the 95% confidence interval on the fold increase will be (1.5, 
2.67) if a standard deviation of log10 transformed RSV
-A Nab of 0.5 is assumed. There 
is a very  small (0.3%) chance that the SD will be larger than 0.[ADDRESS_1153921] with 
2.5% significant level will be at least 90%  with SD 0.4 and 80% with SD 0.[ADDRESS_1153922] with 
2.5% significant level will be 85%  with SD 0.3 and 62% with SD 0.4 assumed.

The study  groups will be defined by  [CONTACT_831400].
For a given subject and a given demographic variable, missing measurements will not be 
replaced.
Safety
For a given subject and the anal ysis of solicited sy mptoms within 7days post-
vaccination, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Therefore 
the anal ysis of the solicited sy mptoms based on the ES will include only  vaccinated

will be considered. Subjects who did not report the event will be considered as 
subjects without the event.
For the anal ysis of concomitant medications , all vaccinated subjects will be 
considered and anal ysis will be performed on the ES. Subj ects who did not report the 
concomitant medication will be considered as subjects without concomitant 
medication .
Imm unogenicity
For a given subject and given immunogenicit y measurement s, missing or non-
evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Therefore, an anal ysis will exclude 
subjects with missing or non-evaluable measurements.
A seronegative subject is a subject whose antibody  titre/concentration is below the 
cut-off value of the assay. A seropositive subject is a subject whose antibody  
titre/concentration is greater than or e qual to the cut -off value of the assay .
The Geometric Mean Titres /Concentrations( GMT /GMCs ) calculations are

RSV  A/B neutralization assay
The serum neutralization assay  is a functional assay  that measures the ability  of serum 
antibodies to neutralize RSV entry  and replication in a host cell line.
First, virus neutralization is performed b y incubating a fixed amount of RSV -A strain 
(Long) or RSV -B strain (B18537) with serial dilutions of the te st serum. Then, the serum-
virus mixture is transferred onto a monolay er of Vero cells (African Green Monkey , 
kidney , 
Cercopi[INVESTIGATOR_227203] , ATCC CCL -81) and incubated for three day s to allow 
infection of Vero cells b y non -neutralized viruses and the format ion of plaques in the cell 
monolay er. Following the fixation period, RSV -infected cells are detected using a 
primary  antibody  directed against RSV (anti -RSV IgG) and a secondary  antibody  
conjugated horse -radish peroxidase (HRP), allowing the visualization of plaques after 
coloration with TrueBlueTMperoxidase substrate. Viral plaques are counted using an 
automated microscope coupled to an image analy zer(Scanlab sy stem with Axiovision 
software). For each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed as a percentage, i s calculated 
between the number of plaques at that dilution and the number of plaques in the virus 
control wells (no serum added). The serum Nab titres is expressed in ED60 (Estimated 
Dilution 60) and corresponds to the inverse of the interpolated serum di lution that y ields 
a 60% reduction in the number of plaques compared to the virus control wells as 
described b y others [ Barbas , 1992; 
Bates , 2014].
RSV PreF3 ELISA
The RSVPreF3 IgGand IgG1 ELISA ’sareunder development. The assay swill be based 
on an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the quantification of total IgG or IgG1 
antibodies directed against RSVPreF3 in human serum samples.
The principle of this assay wil l be as follows: RSVPreF3 antigen will be adsorbed onto a 
96-well poly styrene microplate. After a washing and a blocking step, dilutions of serum 
samples, controls and standards will be added to the coated microplate. A reference 
standard curve will be prepared using a pool of commercial human serum containing 
anti-
RSV antibodies. After incubation, the microplate will be washed to remove unbound 
primary  antibodies. Bound IgG or IgG1 will be detected b y the addition of a secondary 
anti-human antibody  conjugated to HRP. Bound antibodies are quantified by  [CONTACT_831407], tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide, whereby  a colored 
product develops proportional ly to the amount of anti -RSVPreF3 IgG or IgG1 antibodies 
present in the serum sample. The optical density of each sample dilution is then 
interpolated on the reference standard. The corresponding antibod y concentration, 
corrected for the dilution factor, is expressed in arbitrary ELISA Laboratory  Units per 
milliliter (ELU/mL).

specific for the site 0 epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], using RSVPreF3 protein as coating antigen, is under 
development.
The principle of competition assay s is as follows: The RSVPre F3 protein antigen will be 
coated onto an assay  plate. After blocking, dilutions of control serum or sample, as well 
as labelled, epi[INVESTIGATOR_831375]-specific, monoclonal antibody, are added to the coated plate. If 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]- specific antibodies are present in serum samples, they  will compete with the 
monoclonal antibody  for binding to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_784555] -coated plate. After 
washing, the bound, labelled antibody  is then quantitated using a validated chromogenic 
detection sy stem. The intensity  of the detected signal is inversely  proportional to the 
concentration of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific antibodies present in the sample. 
The antibody  concentrations are calculated for each control and sample b y transforming 
the OD values corresponding to the dilutions into a % competition value, and from this, 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific antibody  concentration of the samples and controls is calculated.

PREVENTIVE VA CCINE C LINICA L TRIA LS 
(SEPTEMBER 2007)
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking 
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not 
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach 
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to 
discuss an alternativ e approach, contact [CONTACT_151718]. If you cannot identify 
the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this 
guidance.
INTRODUCTION
Preventive vaccines are usually  developed to prevent disease in a healthy  population. The 
Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 
regulates preventive vaccines under authorit y of section [ADDRESS_1153940] (42 U.S.C. 262), as well as specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, and reviews investigational new drug applications (INDs) and biologics license 
applications (BLAs) (see, for example, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 
312, 600, and 601). Most of the clinical trials of preventi ve vaccines conducted to support 
INDs and BLAs enroll healthy  volunteers in all phases of vaccine testing. The enrollment 
of health y volunteers warrants a very low tolerance for risk in those clinical trials.
This guidance provides you, sponsors, monitors, and investigators of vaccine trials, with 
recommendations on assessing the severit y of clinical and laboratory abnormalities in 
healthy  adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in clinical trials. The grading s ystem 
described in the table can also be usef ul in defining a particular study ’s stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] 
(e.g., a certain number of AEs, as defined in the table, may  call for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] ). 
Less extreme observations (e.g., mild) may  not require discontinuing the study  vaccine 
but can still contribute to evaluating safety  by [CONTACT_159323]. Uniform criteria for categorizing toxicities in healthy  
volunteers can improve comparisons of safet y data among groups within the same stud y 
and also between diff erent studies. We, FDA, recommend using toxicity  grading scale 
tables, provided below, as a guideline for selecting the assessment criteria to be used in a 
clinical trial of a preventive vaccine. We recommend incorporation of such appropriate, 
uniform, cri teria into the investigational plan, case report forms, and study  reports and 
correspondence with FDA, sponsors, monitors, investigators, and IRBs.
This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated April 2005 (70 FR 
[ZIP_CODE], May  2,2005).
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally  enforceable 
responsibilities. I nstead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should 
be viewed onl y as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or stat utory  requ irements 
are cited. The use of the word should in FDA’s guidances means that something is 
suggested or recommended, but not required.

13-AUG -2018 100BACKGROUND
Standardized toxicity  assessment scales have been widely  used to evaluate products 
treating specific diseases. For example, the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity  
Criteria Scale and the Division of AIDS’ Toxicity  Grading Scale standardize the 
evaluation of adverse events among patients with cancer and HIV/AIDS, respectivel y 
(Refs. 1, 2). The defined toxici ty parameters in those scales are designed for patients who 
may alread y experience mild, moderate, or severe adverse clinical or laboratory  events 
due to the disease process, and may  not be appropriate for health y volunteers.
In the development o f the toxicity  grading scales for health y volunteers, we chose 
parameter limit values based on published information, when such values were available 
(Refs. 1 -6). For example, the Brighton Collaboration has developed case definitions and 
guidelines to evaluate some adverse events associated with administering vaccines (Ref. 
3). In some cases, parameter limit values were based on clinical experience and 
experience reviewing vaccine clinical trials that enroll normal health y subjects.
Toxicity  grading scales for labora tory abnormalities should consider the local laboratory  
reference values when the parameter limit values are defined. The characterization of 
laboratory  parameters among some populations of healthy  adults and adolescents may  
require the exercise of clinical judgment, for example, consideration of the potential for 
ethnic differences in white blood cell (WBC) counts or gender differences in creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) values.
TOXICITY GRADING SCALE TABLES
Adverse events in a clinical trial of an i nvestigati onal vaccine must be recorded and 
monitored and, when appropriate, reported to FDA and others involved in an 
investigation (sponsors, IRBs, and investigators). (See, for example, 21 CFR 312.32, 
312.33, 312.50, 312.55, 312.56, 312.60, 312.62, 312.64, and 312.66). Although the use of 
a toxicity  grading scale for adverse events would not replace these regulatory  
requirements, using a scale to c ategori se adverse events observed during a clinical trial 
may assist y ou in monitoring safet y and making required repo rts. Nonetheless, we believe 
that categorization or grading of data as outlined in this document is supplementary  to 
and should not replace full and complete data analy sis.
These guidelines for toxicity  grading scales are primarily  intended for healthy  adult and 
adolescent volunteers. The parameters in the tables below are not necessarily  applicable 
to every  clinical trial of healthy  volunteers. The parameters monitored should be 
appropriate for the specific study  vaccine. For some preventive vaccines under
development, it may  be appropriate to include additional parameters to be monitored 
during a clinical trial or to alter the choice of values in the toxicity  table. For example, 
additional parameters might be added based on one or more of the following: sa fety 
signals observed in pre -clinical toxicology  studies, the biological plausibility of the 
occurrence of certain adverse events, or previous experience with a similar licensed 
product.

listed parameters in all clinical trials of health y volunteers, nor do the tables represent all 
possible parameters to be monitored. I n addition, these tables do not represent study  
inclusion or exclusion criteria. We recommend that the parameters monitored be 
appropriate for the stud y vaccine administered to healthy  volunteers participating in the 
clinical trial.
Tables for Clinical Abnormalities
Note from the sponsor : The tables in this section of the guidance will not be used in this 
particular stud y. Instead, the parameters as provided in the study protocol are to be used.
Tables for Laboratory Abnormalities
The laboratory  values provided in the tables below serve as guidelines and are dependent

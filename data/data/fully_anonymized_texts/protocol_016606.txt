Rationale  
Clinical testing for SARS -CoV -2 falls broadly into two categories: molecular testing to detect the 
genomic sequence of the virus and serology testing for the antibody response of the host. While 
CLIA based testing in both categories has proved valuable for  individual care during the 
pandemic, the cost (up to $100 in some cases) and time (a minimum of [ADDRESS_1229001] cases) 
required for these approaches mean they have had little public health impact on the pandemic. 
A home based surveillance test for the pr esence of SARS -CoV -2 in saliva, that is cheap (a few 
dollars) and fast (under 40 minutes) would be transformative in the global management of 
COVID -19. It would allow nothing less than the reopening of schools, businesses, and the safe 
return of many aspec ts of society to normal. Individuals could test themselves every morning 
before heading to work, for example, to demonstrate they were not currently infected. In this 
protocol, we aim to demonstrate the viability of such an approach in a target population of 
Stanford employees and students who would test themselves at our research facility and upload 
the results via a mobile website/app. The protocol includes enrichment for positive samples 
through a cohort recruited through the Stanford Emergency Department (that would allow calculations of sensitivity required by [CONTACT_55257]) and CLIA validation of these samples , a 
collection of known Sars -Cov -2 samples from external sources (including from Guatemala)  as 
well a random selection of negative home tests to all ow estimation of specificity  The overall aim 
is to demonstrate the feasibility, usability, and real -world validity of home surveillance testing at 
scale to provide the foundation for scaling up to potentially millions of tests around the world. 
Detailed Description of the Technology  
The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has proven to be a reliable and 
simple protocol that can detect small amounts of viral RNA in patient samples. This LAMP 
protocol has the benefits of being simple, requiring no specialized equipment; rapid, requiring 
less than an hour from sample collection to readout; and cheap, costing around $[ADDRESS_1229002] to ensure relia ble LAMP amplification. In this protocol, we 
take advantage of an open hardware solution invented by [CONTACT_104644] (SnapDx) that can be assembled with readily available components for the cost of <$5 dollars a unit and could be 
used together with the LAMP  assay for point of care detection of COVID -19 RNA from saliva. 
We further utilize a novel substrate - cellulose - for RNA extraction to further simplify the 
protocol for LAMP. Finally, we utilize a novel approach in construction of the assay to run the

home tests in a manner to eliminate any chances for reaction cross -contamination; common in 
laboratory molecular tests.  
 
Instruments used with the Test:  
The SnapDx is designed to be a low -cost at-home device for detecting SARS -CoV -2 in saliva 
samples. The process utilizes LAMP (isothermal amplification) reagents to detect SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1229003] hardware: $3-5 dollars per unit (estimate)  
Saliva tube and solutions: $1 dollar per unit (estimate)  
Reagents and Materials:  
Cost breakdown for reagents:  
● TCEP - 1G (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835] [ZIP_CODE]) >3000 reactions - $80 
● EDTA - 100mL (Sigma [ZIP_CODE]) >10,000 reactions - $40 
● Primers - (IDT) 1.2ml of 10X >500 reactions - $30 
● NEB master mix (E1700L) >500 reactions - $650 
 
Primers : It is good practice to make 20µL 100µM aliquots once they are resuspended. In case 
of contamination a fresh stock can be used. For a 10X stock - [ADDRESS_1229004]

Usability/Feasibility  
All study procedures involving contact [CONTACT_879644] (low, 
moderate, high) will be performed by [CONTACT_879645]. All of these personnel have also been vaccinated against COVID -19. Nonetheless they will use standard precautions, including getting tested weekly and 
staying away from others including study personnel and pote ntial participants, in any case of 
symptoms or illness.  
 
A cohort of [ADDRESS_1229005] at our study site. Additional saliva samples will be collected to 
be used for laboratory testing for clinical evaluation purposes . Participants will complete a 
Usability Survey towards the end of taking the SnapDx on our study site to answer questions on satisfaction, ease, information, and use. These Usability questions include the following with 
multiple choice answers (strongly disagree, disagree, somewhat disagree, neither agree nor 
disagree, somewhat agree, agree, strongly agree): 

 
 
10 
- (Satisfaction) Overall, I am satisfied with how easy it was to use the test.  
- (Ease) It was easy to learn to use this test.  
- (Information) It was easy to find the information I needed. 
- (Use) If the SnapDx test were available to me today, I would use this on a regular basis.  
- We also ask If they would be willing to retake the test  
 
Answers to these questions will be summarized and reported to the FDA as the results of our 
Human Usability Study.  
 
Validity  
Saliva samples are to be collected in several patient populations, including from both 
inpatient and outpatient clinics, and COVID positive or negative patients determined by [CONTACT_879646]. We will make a concerted effort to reach out to 
the Stanford and bay area communities and collect positive saliva samples from those who 
have tested positive through a standard PCR test. Five intended users will be given basic 
training to conduct SnapDx tests on these saliva samples as if they were taking the test 
themselves. A small portion of each saliva sample will also be tested for SARS -COV -[ADDRESS_1229006] 
PCR results to determine the positi ve percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent 
agreement (NPA).  
 
Aims  
The aim of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of a saliva based home 
surveillance monitoring test for SARS -CoV- 2 infection. These will be addressed in the 
following sub- aims.  
1) To assess whether there is sufficient concordance between the technician and 
patient in interpretation of findings (Primary Feasibility Aim)  
2) To assess sensitivity and specificity of the home saliva test (Primary Validity Aim)  
 
Primary Feasibility Outcome:  
An indicator for discrepancy in interpretation of findings by [CONTACT_879647] (interrater reliability)  
 
Secondary Feasibility Outcomes:  
There are 4 secondary outcomes involved in assessing feasibility. These include 
 
 
 
11 
1) An indicator for ambiguous findings as measured by [CONTACT_879648] (if <  80% 
confident) in interpretation of results by [CONTACT_879649] (ease of 
interpretation)  
2) An indicator that the participant appropriately followed instructions for using the kit (≥ 80% confident) (ease of use)  
3) An indicator for whether participant called technical support and by [CONTACT_48933] (e.g., device leaked or there was a possible broken part) (ease of use)  
4) An indicator by [CONTACT_879650] (sample integrity)  
 
Primary Validity Outcome:  
An indicator for whether the home saliva test is positive (to assess sensitivity and 
specificity)  
 
Statistical Considerations:  
 
General Considerations:  
We will use the Agresti -Coull method (Agresti and Coull 1998)  to construct confidence 
intervals. Unless otherwise noted, all confidence intervals constructed will be 95% 
confidence intervals.  
 
Analysis Sets:  
There are two key analysis sets that are subsets of the study population. The first 
subset consists of outpatients. The second subset consists of the patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_573815] -related complications who will be tested daily for [ADDRESS_1229007] results will be compared to the results of PCR testing. We 
will calculate the proportion in agreement (# of tests where SnapDx and PCR testing 
agree/# total tests), the proportion correctly identified as positive (# of tests SnapDx -
positive/# PCR- positive), and the proportion correctly identified as negative (# of tests 
SnapDx -negative/# PCR -negative). A threshold of 80% overall agreement and 85% 
agreement in the positive tests will indicate the home test is feasible.  
 
 
 
12 
Percent confidence in interpretation of the results and that instructions were followed 
correctly will be summarized as 1) percent of respondents stating that they are at least 
80% confident in their interpretation and 2) median and interquartile range of reported 
confidence levels. Results will be reported separately for participants and technicians.  
 The proportion of participants who call technical support will be presented and the 
frequency of the reason for the call will be presented. The proportion of tests that have a 
sufficient amount of saliva to reach the indicator line will be presented.  
 The feasibility outcomes will be presented separately by [CONTACT_879651] 
a subgroup. For example, we will evaluate whether the concordance is comparable 
across different age groups, between men and women, etc.  
 
Analysis of the Validity Outcomes 
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value 
(NPV) of the test will be estimated using the results collected in outpatients. The results 
of the PCR -based test will be the gold standard used to estimate the test’s diagnostic 
accuracy. Home test results will only be included in this analysis if the test is performed within [ADDRESS_1229008] a small amount of missing data. For example, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879640] 5 may not provide data for days 1- 5; 
participants may not complete the surveys each time they provide results from their home tests; or some PCR test results may not be able to be linked to the home test 
results. Analyses in the outpatient population will assume that data is missing at random 
and will  use multiple imputation methods to account for the missing data. Given the 
small number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879641], we will perform a complete case analysis in the analysis set consisting of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. Sensitivity analyses will 
be performed to evaluate the robustness of our findings to assumptions about missing 
data.   
  
 
Recruitment: 
The study will recruit up to [ADDRESS_1229009] Health Care 
 
 
13 
300 and 500P locations (the Emergency Department and other in- patient wards 
particularly M7, the COVID ward), as well as the front entrance of Stanford hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879642]. We will also be recruiting folks from the bay area 
community f or our study. Participants will fall into two categories: i) those receiving a 
CLIA certified nasal swab COVID -[ADDRESS_1229010] at SHC at the moment of recruitment, and ii) 
those not.   
 We will be recruiting a high- risk population because we will be recruiting from a pool 
that includes people who are seeking medical attention and/or participating in COVID -
related research studies. Feasibility and validity of the tests will be evaluated in the 
high- risk population. We will be additionally recruiting a low -risk population to assess 
feasibility in the general population. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879643] a 
five day period when we expect to see a mix of positive and negative tests.  
 To increase the number of SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_1229011] DUA/MTA in place and will have 
institutional approv al and have received written informed consent from all participants 
for the local trials, including the sharing of these samples with Stanford University for the current trial. 
 
 
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria:  
(as noted above)  
 
Consent  
Potential participants will be approached by [CONTACT_879652]. They will be asked if they have an interest in participating and if 
so, whether they have an internet data- enabled cell phone capable of uploading high 
resolution photographs. Interested participants will then be directed to the digital e-consent implemented in REDCap on the mobile web browser.  The CRC will be 
available to answer questions. The participants will also be provided an email and contact [CONTACT_879653].  
 For the pediatric population, informed consent will be given by [CONTACT_879654] (generally at least 7 years old).  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1229012] procedure. In addition, written instructions for use (IFU) will be available.  
 Participants will be asked to carry out as many tests as are included in the bag (most likely between one and two) on a daily basis until they are used up.  
 Test description  
 Test materials: saliva collection tube, small handheld centrifuge, test kit (plasticware)  
The test kit should be stored in a regular fridge (4C) at the location of the participant -  
prior to use.  
 The test materials include a cartridge containing a tube with closed reagents into which 
the participant will provide the saliva sample. Participants will be asked to provide 1ml of 
saliva into the collection tube, after which they will close the cap of the cartridge. They 
will be asked to pour boiling water into a mug and place the tube into the boiling water 
for [ADDRESS_1229013] the tube back in the mug of 
water for 40 minutes. At the end of 40 minutes, they remove the tube and note the color 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]/ orange = negative, yellow  = positive). They will take a photograph of the tube 
against a given white photocard (provided in the kit)  and upload it to the website. After 
filling in the short (<1 minute) symptom questionnaire and the short usability (<20 
seconds) questionnaire they will dispose of the tube in the trash.  
 At that point, if the test result is negative (no evidence of infection) then they will be 
asked to do nothing other than fill in a survey and upload the image of the tube via study app. If the test result is positive  they will be instructed to behave as if they might be 
infectious in their home and outside of their home (maximizing the use of masks and 
distancing) and asked to take a CLIA nasal swab test at their nearest SHC testing site 
at their earliest opportunity.

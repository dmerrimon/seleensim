The main goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_595852] a clinical trial to assess MORE with respect to a range of clinical outcomes. This study will involve a 2-arm individually randomized controlled trial design that compares MORE and treatment as usual (TAU). A. Objectives The main objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_595853], retaining, and following up with MMT patients in the MORE and TAU interventions.  Will track the following: When approached by [CONTACT_464], the number of individuals who express interest in the study and the number who refuse (and reasons for refusal).The number of individuals who contact [CONTACT_595903].The number of individuals screened and eligible/ineligible.The number of individuals consented.The number of individuals who refuse participation after/during consent process.The number of sessions completed by [CONTACT_19288].The number of participants who drop out and reasons for drop out.Reasons for missed sessions.Tracking of all contact [CONTACT_595904]-up assessment sessions and completed/missed assessments.In addition, the study will explore outcomes among participants in the MORE condition relative to treatment as usual (TAU) in regard to opi[INVESTIGATOR_595854]:Time until first opi[INVESTIGATOR_595855]Time until MMT dropoutTotal days of methadone treatmentTotal days of opi[INVESTIGATOR_595856]Trajectories of positive and negative affectDrug cravingPain severity and pain interference B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s)This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_595857] a novel intervention, MORE, on opi[INVESTIGATOR_595851]. We will evaluate progression to a larger study based on the success of three key milestones. For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we plan to evaluate our ability to recruit participants into the study, defining successful recruitment as 75% or more of our planned sample size by [CONTACT_24473] 7. Retention will be considered successful if 50% of participants attend at least [ADDRESS_786607] 8-week and 16-week follow up data, defining success as a follow-up rate of 65% of participants at 8-weeks and 50% of participants at 16-weeks assessed at month 11. In addition to evaluating study feasibility through obtaining these milestones, we will obtain information about the efficacy of MORE on opi[INVESTIGATOR_595858]. It is hypothesized that: 1) Participants in MORE will have a longer duration of time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_595859]; 2) Participants in MORE will have a longer duration of time to MMT dropout than TAU Pro2018001127            3/24/2021            2/23/2022

Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) is a novel intervention that addresses drug use and chronic pain, and is unique among current OUD interventions in that it helps break negative reinforcement cycles by [CONTACT_595905]-drug related cues.5,[ADDRESS_786609] this promising intervention among individuals with pain who are receiving MMT for an OUD.This study is significant because it could provide an additional and, as compared to existing behavioral interventions, a potentially more effective option for preventing relapse and managing chronic pain in people receiving MAT. Specifically, if found to be effective, MORE could help people on MAT cope with the stress and dysfunction associated with pain, reduce their risk of relapse, and enhance their overall quality of life. 1.3 Research Design and MethodsThis pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] a 2-arm individually randomized controlled trial design in which outcomes of MMT patients randomized to MORE are compared to outcomes of those randomized to treatment as usual (TAU). In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (R21; N=31), we will randomize MMT patients with chronic pain to MORE (n=15) or TAU (n=16). This study phase will focus on establishing study feasibility in recruiting, retaining, and following up study participants before progressing to a larger Phase II clinical trial (R33, N=150). Participants with pain who are receiving MMT for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) will be recruited from the New Brunswick Counseling Center (NBCC) and the Lennard Clinic.

The number of individuals who contact [CONTACT_595907]. Number of individuals who refuse study participation and who consent to the study will also be tracked. If an individual is interested in study participation, a trained research assistant will lead the individual through the informed consent process in a private space.Participants randomized to the MORE condition will participate in eight, weekly, two-hour group sessions led by a clinic or study counselor. Each session will contain 4-[ADDRESS_786610] in a private room at the New Brunswick Counseling Center (NBCC) or the Lennard Clinic. Attendance at each session and reasons for missing sessions will be recorded Participants randomized to the control condition will continue receiving treatment as usual at the NBCC. All study participants will partake in a total of three interviews lasting up to [ADDRESS_786611] a urine or saliva sample collected during each assessment. This is required to verify self-report of drug use. Due to social desirability, it is common for people to not accurately report drug use; therefore, biochemical verification is the gold standard measure of drug use. All attempts to reach participants to schedule follow-up assessments will be tracked. Participants will also complete cognitive testing (for approx. 30-45 minutes) at baseline and 8-weeks and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) conducted via smartphones, which will be provided to each participant by [CONTACT_464]. EMA participation will require the participant to respond to twice-daily prompts in which they will be asked a series of brief questions regarding their current mood and exposure to opi[INVESTIGATOR_595864]. Additionally, subjects will be asked to initiate responses when they experience serious craving or relapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Each EMA assessment will last approximately 3-5 minutes.B.What data points will be collected including long-term follow-up?All study participants will participate in three face-to-face assessments at baseline, 8-weeks, and 16-weeks. If participants are unable or unwilling to attend a research appointment at their clinic, a research assistant will conduct a telephone interview. Information will be collected on demographic characteristics, substance use, methadone treatment, opi[INVESTIGATOR_595865], physical pain, non-reactivity, negative and positive affect, attentional bias, cognitive and mental health, physical health, and intervention implementation and attitudes. At the baseline and 8-week research visits, participants will complete three cognitive tasks on a computer that assess inhibitory control, implicit (automatic) associations, and the precedence of global features in visual perception. Urine and/or saliva samples will be requested at each assessment for confirmation of self-reported drug use. In addition, participants will partake in daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA) throughout the 16-weeks of study participation that include brief measures of pain intensity, mood, and substance use. Additionally, participants will be asked to initiate communication via smartphone when they either lapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_595866].  Self-initiated responses will include information about the circumstances surrounding their craving/lapse. A synopsis of all study instruments are included below (see 1.9B – Study instruments).

We will consider our ability to follow participants successful if we obtain 8-week assessments from at least 65% of participants and 16-week assessments from at least 50%. Although we are targeting a follow-up rate in both groups of at least 80% and 75% at 8 and 16 weeks, respectively, we set the benchmarks at 65% and 50% because, again, if necessary, we can adapt follow-up strategies for the next study, based on lessons learned in this study.Preliminary outcome measures to be assessed during this pi[INVESTIGATOR_595868]. Preliminary secondary outcomes will be: days of methadone medication use, days of opi[INVESTIGATOR_74480], and changes in pain severity and intensity. Additional measures are described below. 1.[ADDRESS_786613] pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT; N=53) of MORE, and found that, relative to a support group (SG) control, MORE significantly decreased stress, modified addiction attentional bias, and increased heart rate variability recovery from substance cues during an affect-modulated cue-reactivity protocol. Two follow-up studies (N=58) found that trait mindfulness among substance dependent individuals in treatment was negatively associated with addiction attentional bias and positively associated with heart rate variability recovery from stress-primed cue-exposure.8,9 MORE as a treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_595869] – preliminary outcomes and processes.[CONTACT_198834] recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4248] [ADDRESS_786614]-treatment assessment. Intent-to-treat analyses indicate that compared with a support group (SG; n=58) control, MORE (n=57) led to significant reductions in pain severity (p=.014, d=.63) and functional interference (p=.002; d= .84) that were maintained at 3-month follow-up and mediated by [CONTACT_105]-reactivity and reinterpretation of pain as innocuous sensory signals. Importantly, MORE improved addiction-related outcomes. Relative to SG, a greater proportion of opi[INVESTIGATOR_595870], due to reductions in aberrant drug-related behavior, X2=3.74, p=.05. MORE also significantly reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_595871]-treatment (p=.027, d=.50), and significantly decreased the correlation strength between craving and misuse.[ADDRESS_786615]. In a sample of low SES individuals with OUD and comorbid psychiatric disorders, MORE (n=20) led to significantly greater reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506] (p=.04, d=.63) and PTSD symptoms (p=.001, d=.84) compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).10. In this trial, across [ADDRESS_786616]-treatment. Patients in MORE reported significantly greater improvements in momentary pain (p=.01) and positive affect (p=.004) than patients in the SG. Further, over the entire course of treatment, patients in MORE were significantly more likely to exhibit positive affect regulation (OR=2.75) than patients in the SG. Finally, improvements in positive affect (but not pain) over the course of intervention were associated with reduced risk of misusing opi[INVESTIGATOR_595872]-treatment (p=.02).10 1.5 Sample Size JustificationA total of 31 OUD patients with chronic pain who are receiving MAT will be recruited from New Brunswick Counseling Center (NBCC) and the Lennard Clinic. Patients will be randomized into either MORE (n=15) or TAU (n=16). Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], a sample size of 31 is deemed sufficient to determine whether study methods are feasible for recruitment, retention, and follow-up for a larger, fully-powered randomized controlled trial.

The MORE arm will participate in eight, weekly, two-hour group sessions led by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. MORE sessions involve mindfulness training to prevent opi[INVESTIGATOR_595873], cognitive reappraisal to decrease negative affect and regulate opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506], and savoring to augment natural reward processing and evoke positive emotion.[ADDRESS_786617] debriefs participants’ homework practice of using mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring skills to cope with pain and enhance well-being in everyday life.

Next, new psychoeducational material is introduced according to the session topi[INVESTIGATOR_595875] 3. Sessions culminate with an experiential exercise, and close with a brief mindful breathing meditation. Participants are asked to practice 15 minutes of mindfulness/reappraisal/savoring skills each day (i.e. homework practice).
Treatment as Usual (TAU). In the MMT programs, clients typi[INVESTIGATOR_595876] (usually 6 days per week at the beginning of treatment) to get their methadone dose; as clients progress through the program and remain abstinent from drugs, they earn “take home doses” that they can take on days that they are not required to come to the clinic. Timing of the initiation of take-home doses and the scheduling of clinic days varies across clinics.  Clients see their clinic substance abuse counselor for individual counseling, usually weekly at the beginning of treatment, with decreasing frequency if they remain abstinent and progress through treatment. Depending on clients’ stage of MMT and success with remaining abstinent from drugs, they may be required to attend clinic treatment groups. Also, some clients may choose to go to voluntary counseling, educational, or support groups (none of these groups involve copi[INVESTIGATOR_595877]-based). All individual treatment characteristics, including methadone dosage, take-home dosing, clinic attendance and attendance at clinic counseling sessions and groups, will be documented for all study participants and entered as covariates in the analyses.

The EMA will be programmed as a REDCap survey delivered over a password-protected smart phone that will not store any EMA data. REDCap is a secure, HIPPA-compliant, web-based application for building and managing online surveys and databases. The EMA survey approach will involve 1) collecting event-contingent records of lapses when they occur as well as 2) regular random assessments , prompted by [CONTACT_595913], twice daily via smartphones. For event-contingent records, participants will be asked to initiate an entry when an opi[INVESTIGATOR_595884], and note how they were feeling and the extent of craving. One random assessment probe will be scheduled between 9 am and 3 pm and one will be scheduled between 3 pm and 9 pm. The random probes will be generated by [CONTACT_595914] a Twilio phone number. For random assessments, participants will be asked to note how they are feeling, drug use,  and whether they completed their homework (if in the intervention group).  Research staff will demonstrate to study participants how to use the phones, respond to the prompts, and provide event contingent data. Research staff will observe participants using the phone and practice using the phone with participants until they are capable of using it.Data will be received by [CONTACT_595915].

At each research visit we will conduct a timeline follow-back3 with each participant to account for missing EMA drug use data. The timeline follow-back is a reliable and valid measure where participants are asked to recall and record events (e.g., drug use) within a specified time period on a calendar. We will combine self-report of opi[INVESTIGATOR_595885], and without biochemical verification, self-reported drug use as an outcome variable will be questioned by [CONTACT_37226]. If a biochemical measure is negative, but the participant reports drug use, the participant will be coded as using drugs since the biochemical measure will only capture a specific time point. However, if the participant self-reports drug abstinence, but the biochemical measure is positive for drug use (the more likely scenario) the participant will be coded as having used drugs.Craving (Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks).Opi[INVESTIGATOR_595886] (PACS)[ADDRESS_786621] been used in trials of mindfulness-based interventions for substance use.6 The Craving Suppression Scale is a 17 –item measure that assesses how individuals cope with cravingPain (Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks). For study eligibility, pain intensity will be assessed at baseline only with Gracely Box Scale,7 a visual analog scale that ranges from 0 (no pain) to 20 (extremely intense pain). At baseline and both follow-up points, pain severity will also be measured with the the Brief Pain Inventory8 (BPI; α = .87) a well-validated measure that has been widely used to tap acute and chronic pain. Participants will be asked to report their worst pain during the past week, least pain during the past week, average pain, and current pain. Response options range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as I can imagine). An overall pain severity score will be computed by [CONTACT_595918]. Pain will also be assessed with the Sensations Body Map.Pain interference (Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks). Pain-related functional interference will be assessed with the pain interference subscale of the BPI8 (α = .88). Subjects will be asked to rate on a 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) scale the extent to which pain interfered with each of seven domains of normal functioning in the past week, including: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life. An overall pain interference score will be computed by [CONTACT_595919].Copi[INVESTIGATOR_54241] (Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks). Cognitive copi[INVESTIGATOR_595887]9 (CSQ). This subscale has good internal consistency (α= 0.88), and is comprised of 6 items including “I don’t think of it as pain but rather as a dull or warm feeling,” and “I just think of it as another sensation such as numbness.” Participants will be asked to report how much they generally engaged in this form of copi[INVESTIGATOR_595888]. Responses are rated on a scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (always); a reinterpretation of pain sensations total score can be obtained by [CONTACT_595920] (range: from 0 to 36). Scores on this scale are meaningfully related to measures of pain and adjustment to pain,[ADDRESS_786622] been shown to mediate the therapeutic effects of mindfulness training on chronic pain.10Nonreactivity (Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks). Nonreactivity to distressing thoughts and emotions will be measured with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire.11 This scale is comprised of items such as “When I have distressing thoughts or images, I ‘step back’ and I am aware of the thought or image without getting taken over by [CONTACT_13114].” These skills appear to tap metacognitive decentering or disengagement from aversive experiences, and have been shown to mediate the effects of mindfulness training on decreased pain.10Reappraisal (Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks). Reappraisal will be measured with the positive reappraisal subscale of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ),12 an internally-consistent subscale (α = .85) which asks the respondent how often they “think I can become a stronger person as a result of what has happened” or “look Pro2018001127            3/24/2021            2/23/2022

Responses are rated on a scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). In prior research, scores on this reappraisal scale were prospectively predictive of lower levels of future affective symptoms,12 and changes in CERQ reappraisal scores mediated the stress-reductive effects of mindfulness.13 Also reappraisal will be assessed with the 9-item Mindful Reappraisal Of Of Painful Sensations Scale. Responses are rated on a scale ranging from 0 (never do that) to 6 (always do that);Positive and Negative Affect (Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16-weeks). We will assess positive and negative affect with the valid and reliable Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).14 The PANAS is a 20-item, self-report measure that consists of two scales (positive affect and negative affect) of 10-items each. Participants will rate factors related to positive or negative affect on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much).Cognitive impairment, psychosis, suicidality (screening). To determine study eligibility, cognitive impairment will be assessed with the Mini Mental Status Exam,15 psychosis will be assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V (SCID) Psychotic screen,[ADDRESS_786623], registration, attention and calculation, recall, language, Scores <24 indicate cognitive impairment. The SCID Psychotic Screen is a semi-structured clinical interview that assesses symptoms of psychotic disorders (e.g., delusions, hallucinations) based on the DSM-V criteria. The ASQ is a  five item screening tool that is part of the NIMH toolkit.17Mental health history (Baseline) and psychiatric symptoms and treatment (Baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks). At baseline, history of mental illness and psychiatric treatment will be assessed. At each subsequent research visit, participants will be asked if they took any psychotropic medications or received any mental health counseling since their last visit. At each research visit, symptoms of depression and anxiety will be evaluated with the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_595889].Physical health history (Baseline) and symptoms (Baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks) and pain medication (baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks). At Baseline, history of illness such as HIV, cancer, heart disease, emphysema, asthma and other chronic conditions will be assessed. Daily health functioning will be evaluated at every research visit with the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 (SF-36).20 The reliability and validity of this self-report scale that measures overall health and ability to complete daily activities has been shown. Current pain medication (prescribed and over the counter) will be assessed at each research visit.Savoring (Baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks). Savoring will be measured by [CONTACT_595921] (SBI), The SBI is a reliable and valid scale that consists of 6 items that assess individuals' perceptions of their ability to derive pleasure through anticipating upcoming positive events, savoring positive moments, and reminiscing about past positive experiences The following cognitive tasks will be completed on a laptop computer. The computer tasks will be administered online through the Inquisit platform. Pre-developed Inquisit scripts exist for each computer task, and participants' encrypted task data will be housed on a secure server "using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)”, the same technology used by [CONTACT_595922][INVESTIGATOR_595890]" (https://www.millisecond.com/support/docs/v5/Inquisit.pdf). Each task will be scored within the Inquisit platform according to validated scoring methods.Inhibitory control, Go-No Go Task (Baseline, 8-weeks): To assess inhibitory control, participants are asked to press the Spacebar on a computer when they see, on the computer screen, a green rectangle (=go) but refrain from pressing the Spacebar when they see a blue rectangle (=nogo).21 The blue and green rectangles can be vertical or Pro2018001127            3/24/2021            2/23/2022

The vertical rectangle has a high probability of being green (a go trial) and the horizontal rectangle has a high probability of being blue (a nogo trial). Participants get information about the orientation of the rectangle (=cue) shortly before the color of the rectangle is revealed. Mean reaction times will be derived from the Go/No-Go tasks.Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/Natural Reward, Implicit Association Task (IAT; Baseline, 8-weeks): The IAT is a widely-used cognitive-behavioral paradigm that measures the strength of automatic (implicit) associations between concepts in people’s minds relying on latency measures in a simple sorting task.22 Participants are asked to, on a computer, categorize attributes (e.g. "pleasant"; "unpleasant") and and target items (e.g "friends" vs. "pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]") into predetermined categories via keystroke presses. The basic task is to press a left key (E) if an item (e.g. "pleasant") belongs to the category presented on the left (e.g. "Good") and to press the right key (I) if the word (e.g. " unpleasant  ") belongs to the category ("Bad") presented on the right. For practice, participants sort items into the target categories "Opi[INVESTIGATOR_595891]. Natural Reward" and the attribute categories "Good vs. Bad". For the test, participants are asked to sort categories into the paired/combined categories (e.g. "Natural Reward OR Good" on the left vs. "Opi[INVESTIGATOR_595892]" on the right). Pairings are reversed for a second test (e.g. "Opi[INVESTIGATOR_595893]" on the left vs. "Natural Rewards OR Bad" on the right). Block order is counterbalanced by [CONTACT_595923].  A d-score will be derived from the implicit association task.Precedence of Global Features in Visual Perception, Global Local Task (Baseline, 8-weeks): On a computer, participants are briefly presented with letter shapes (e.g. H or S) that are made up of little letter shapes (e.g. H or S).[ADDRESS_786624] the same global (overall shape) and local (individual building shapes) letters (e.g. an H that consists of Hs), and some have different global and local letters (e.g. an H that consists of Ss). In the global condition participants are asked to respond to the global shape of the letter (e.g. press key H if the global shape of the letter is an H regardless of individual building blocks); in the local condition participants are asked to respond to the local shapes of the letter (e.g. press H if the local building elements are Hs regardless of overall shape). The number of errors during the last block of the global/local task will provide a shifting attention score.Intervention implementation (Week 8).

Procedures for Risks to Embryo, Fetus, and/or Pregnant SubjectsN/AC. Risks to Non-SubjectsN/AD. Assessment of Social Behavior ConsiderationsReasonably Foreseeable RisksA risk associated with this study, among people who have substance use disorder and possibly a mental health disorder, is discomfort related to talking about personal or sensitive issues in study assessments and group sessions. However, participants do not have to talk about anything they do not want to. Loss of confidentiality, in general or about sensitive information like substance use, is a risk. While we are not actively recruiting participants with an existing psychological disorder, it is possible we enroll individuals who we subsequently find to be suicidal or have other mental health problems. Personal information may be disclosed to a participant’s clinic counselor, program director, or other public safety of healthcare personnel if study staff believes, based upon information reported during intervention sessions or through research assessments, that a participant may harm himself or herself or others. Protocols have been developed to manage unexpected emergencies involving individuals with mental health problems, as well as to manage risks associated with participant discomfort. Risk Of Imposing An Intervention On Subject With Existing Condition.All interventions will be voluntary and participants can discontinue at any time.Other Foreseeable RisksN/AObservation And Sensitive InformationN/AE.

Written protocols have been established for these circumstances.Group participants will be informed about the importance of confidentiality and study staff will be trained to protect participant confidentiality. Data will be collected in private areas to prevent disclosure of information. Also, to assure confidentiality, data and recordings will be secured in a database management system, password protected files, and in secure file cabinets. Data collection forms, databases and recording will not include identifiers other than a study ID code. The key to the code will be kept separately in a locked file. Informed consent forms will be kept separated in a locked file in the same office. Three levels of security are provided to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing data: password protection, computer or file cabinet locks, and a locked office. In addition, we will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health that protects study data from forced disclosure. F. Certificate of ConfidentialitySince all NIH studies are automatically issued a Certificate of Confidentiality (COC), the study is already covered by a COC. As of October 1, 2017, NIH funded researchers will no longer have to request a CoC, nor will they receive an actual certificate. The CoC will be issued automatically to NIH funded grants, cooperative agreements, contracts and intramural research projects research funded wholly or in part by [CONTACT_595929], sensitive information. G. Potential Benefits to SubjectsParticipants in the MORE study group will receive the benefit of free group therapy sessions. Further, participants who do not use opi[INVESTIGATOR_595897] a result of this study will gain important health and quality of life benefits. Because the risk of receiving free group treatment is very small, and the potential benefits for individual participants and society are quite large, the risk/benefit ratio is clearly weighted on the side of the benefit for those randomized to the intervention condition. Further, if MORE is ultimately found to be effective, in the future, it could help improve quality of life and prevent relapse for all individuals with chronic pain and in methadone treatment, including all of the participants. However, this study could also have no direct benefit to study participants.H. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of SubjectsGroup participants will be informed about the importance of confidentiality and study staff will be trained to protect participant confidentiality. Data will be collected in private areas to prevent disclosure of information. Also, to assure confidentiality, data and recordings will be secured in a database management system, password protected files, and in secure file cabinets. Data collection forms, databases and recording will not include identifiers other than a study ID code. The key to the code will be kept separately in a locked file. Informed consent forms will be kept separated in a locked file in the same office. Three levels of security are provided to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing data: password protection, computer or file cabinet locks, and a locked office. Transmission of EMA data will be encrypted and data will not be stored on participants’ mobile phones. The REDCap system, a HIPPA compliant, secure system will be utilized to collect and manage all EMA data and EMA data will not contain any identifying information. In addition, we will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality (COC) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that protects study data from forced disclosure.

The plan might include establishing a data monitoring committee and a plan for reporting data monitoring committee findings to the IRB and the sponsor.The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet every 3 months to monitor and evaluate the safety of participants throughout the course of the research study. The DSMB will:Assess the performance of the study with respect to participant recruitment, retention and follow-up, protocol adherence, and data quality and completeness.Monitor interim data regarding the safety of the study regimes.Review and consider any protocol modifications or ancillary studies proposed by [CONTACT_595931]. Advise the Institutional Review Board as to whether the protocol should continue as scheduled or undergo a modification due to a finding from the monitoring process. B. Type of Data EvaluatedInclude what data are reviewed, including safety data, untoward events, and efficacy data.The study investigators and the DSMB will be responsible for data safety and monitoring. Quarterly, the DSMB and the investigators will monitor the cumulative safety data during the period when participants are in the study. They will: 1) assess the performance of the study with respect to participant recruitment, retention and follow-up, protocol adherence, and data quality and completeness, to help ensure the likelihood of successful and timely trial completion; 2) monitor interim data regarding the safety of the study regimens; 3) review and consider any protocol modifications by [CONTACT_595932]; and 4) advise the Institutional Review Board and NIH as to whether the protocol should continue as scheduled or undergo a modification due to a finding from the monitoring process.  C. Collection of Safety InformationExplain how the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report forms, at study visits, by [CONTACT_10774]).Safety information will be collected during participant’s assessments, telephone calls with participants, conversations with clinic staff, and MORE group sessions.D. Frequency of Data CollectionThe frequency of data collection, including when safety data collection starts.Safety data collection will begin with collection of the first baseline assessment and continue through the end of the follow-up data collection period (12 months total).  In addition to using assessment data to monitor safety, study clinicians will record any adverse events that they become aware of during MORE group sessions and study Investigators will ask NBCC and the Lennard Clinic personnel, with participant consent, to notify the research team should they become aware that any study participant has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595899].  Such notifications will be requested throughout the study period. All adverse events will be recorded on spreadsheets and will include details of the adverse event and whether or not it was study-related.  Numbers and types of events and other quantifiable event details will be entered into a database for analysis.  E.

The DSMB will monitor the study according to the guidelines specified in the study protocol and the operating procedures established at the initial DSMB meeting, unless the DSMB determines during the course of the trial that modification of the guidelines is in the best interest of the study and its participants. Such a decision may be based on new information that emerges during the course of the study (e.g., publication of the results of a similar study), realization of inappropriate initial study assumptions, or the occurrence of an unanticipated scenario. F. Schedule of Review of Cumulative DataThe frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative data.Under supervision of the investigators, the Research Assistant will conduct monthly descriptive summaries on all data to ensure their accuracy. This will not involve completing any statistical comparisons. If problems are noted in data entry (e.g., out of range values, missing values), the Research Assistant and the investigators will investigate the root cause, and solutions to rectify the problem. G. Tests for Safety DataThe statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm is occurring.Basic statistical tests, including frequency distributions, Anovas and t-tests, will be carried out to compare the control and intervention groups on numbers and types of adverse events within specific time frames in order to insure the safety of the intervention. H. Suspension of ResearchAny conditions that trigger an immediate suspension of the research.Considering the minimal risk nature of the intervention, we do not anticipate any serious adverse events that could trigger the immediate suspension of the research.6.4 Reporting ResultsA.

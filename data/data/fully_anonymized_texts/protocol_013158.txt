required number of participants.
VAPAHCS has several services which will be sources of research participants: the Stanford- VA Alzheimer
Research Study Center (a [LOCATION_004] State funded project ), Geriatric Memory Clinics, Neurology clinics, the
Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC ), and the General Outpatient Clinics.
The investigator conducts and supervises outpatient neurocognitive evaluations for veterans and adult
volunteers at Stanford-VA Alzheimer Research Study Center. Approximately 90 %of patients seen have
some degree of cognitive impairment, ranging from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)to dementia. The
clinic evaluates approximately [ADDRESS_308918].
The Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC )consists of three services. The Geriatrics
Primary Care Clinic provides primary care to veterans age 65 or older. The patient panel consists of
approximately 184 active patients. Approximately 11 %of patients in this clinic have a current diagnosis of
dementia, 7 %with mild cognitive impairment or cognitive disorder NOS, and 16 %of patients have other
neurologic conditions that may impair cognition. The Geriatrics Interdisciplinary Team Continuity Clinic is
an interdisciplinary team clinic providing primary care for approximately 65 frail, often medically complex
older veterans. Approximately 48 %of patients have a diagnosis of dementia, 31 %with mild cognitive
impairment or cognitive disorder NOS, and 28 %of patients have other neurologic conditions that may
impair cognition. The Geriatric Consult Clinic provides interdisciplinary geriatrics team consultative
evaluation and management direction for patients who receive their primary care within the VA system. The
consultative team includes a geriatrician, clinical nurse specialist, and geriatric social worker. Patients are
referred to this clinic for geriatric conditions and/or syndromes, including cognitive disorders and dementia,
poly-pharmacy, and falls. In the past 6 months the Clinic was referred 59 patients, and of these patients 61 %
had dementia and 27 %had cognitive disorder NOS or mild cognitive impairment.
Another ongoing research project, PTSD-Sleep Apnea longitudinal study, has accumulated a large cohort of
veterans (about 250 )with average of about 65 year-old. The participants of this study has had their baseline
cognitive function assessed. Their cognitive functions are monitored longitudinally. It is estimated that as
high as a quarter of the participants meet diagnostic criteria of mild cognitive impairment sometime during
the study period. The PI (J. Cheng )is a consultant of the study and has access to this pool of patients.
Lastly, the Primary Care Outpatient clinics will serve as a source of participants. These clinics serve
thousands of patients annually and have a history of referring patients to the MIRECC for research
participation.
f) Access to resources if needed as a consequence of the research.
State whether you have medical or psychological resources available that participants might require as
a consequence of the research when applicable. Please describe these resources.
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_253926]. [CONTACT_216546] and Ashford (Co-Investigators )are psychiatrists, and [CONTACT_254000] is a psychologist; all are available to participants if needed. The Protocol Director or a senior
research associate will provide psychological resources to participants, if necessary. Appropriate referrals
will be made when necessary in the judgment of the physician and/or psychologist. As the study takes place

a) In layperson's language state the purpose of the study in 3-5 sentences.
The purpose of this study is to is to evaluate the effectiveness of
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)as a treatment
for cognitive impairment due to conditions such as Alzheimer's
disease (AD).
b) State what the Investigator (s)hope to learn from the study. Include an assessment of the importance of
this new knowledge.
The primary hypothesis is that rTMS applied to the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex will lead to improved memory, language and
executive function compared to patients who receive a sham, control
treatment. The improvement is defined as having higher performance on
the [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II ). Secondary Hypothesis
are that 1 )rTMS- will lead to higher performance on secondary
cognitive measures relating to executive function and naming compared
to performance by [CONTACT_253953]; and that 2 )rTMS-induced memory
improvement parallels changes in BDNF levels after treatment.
c) Explain why human subjects must be used for this project. (i.e. purpose of study is to test efficacy of
investigational device in individuals with specific condition; purpose of study is to examine specific
behavioral traits in humans in classroom or other environment )
This is a study of aging and cognition in humans.
2. Study Procedures
a) Please SUMMARIZE the research procedures, screening through closeout, which the human subject
will undergo. Refer to sections in the protocol attached in section 16, BUT do not copy the clinical
protocol. Be clear on what is to be done for research and what is part of standard of care.
Prescreening: We will review medical records of veterans who have
learned about this study and expressed their interest in
participating, and veterans who have consented to receive information
about other studies when they entered a VA study previously.
Additionally, study staff will review charts of veterans being seen
in the VA healthcare system. Veterans will not receive blind phone
calls from study staff. For charts that are flagged in the
prescreening phase as potentially meeting eligibility criteria,
these veterans will be contact[CONTACT_253954], and basic study information provided. If the veteran is
interested and contacts the study team, a formal screening process
will follow.
Screening: The veteran will meet with principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_253927]. Detailed study information will be provided and
veteran given opportunities to ask questions and clarify any issues.
When the veteran clearly expresses understanding and decides to
participate a consent form will be presented to the veteran and
signature [CONTACT_253993]. An optional
consent form for lumbar puncture will also be signed by [CONTACT_253955](she)decides to participate in that portion of the study.

Approval Period: 01/31/2020 - 11/12/[ADDRESS_308919] baseline cognitive
function evaluated and recorded . Medical history will be verified
and physical exam performed. Motor threshold will be obtained. When
all eligibility criteria are met, randomization phase is begun.
Randomization:
This is a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Eligible
participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 )
rTMS treatment group, one to three treatments daily, 3 to 5 days a
week, for about 2 weeks to achieve a total of 20 sessions (similar to
another ongoing protocol at this site )and Group 2 )sham treatment
(same frequency and duration as treatment group ). The location of
each patient's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be estimated by
[CONTACT_35755] 6 centimeters from the location where the motor threshold
is found; this placement method is commonly used in rTMS research.
In the case of the optional MRI, the MRI will be used to guide TMS
stimulation.
rTMS will then be applied to each participant's left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.
Participants will complete the [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test,
second edition (CVLT-II )at three time points: initial baseline
evaluation, immediately after treatment, and [ADDRESS_308920]-finding ([LOCATION_011] Naming Test ), category fluency test
(animal), speed and executive functioning (Trail Making Test part A
and B), Brief Visuospatial Momory Test (BVMT-R )Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE )and a depression assessment. To minimize practice
effects of repeated testing, alternate forms of neuropsychological
tests will be counterbalanced and administered when available.
Intervention Phase:
Units of 5-10 sessions will normally be delivered over one week's
time. The entire treatment phase (20 sessions )will normally occur
in 2-[ADDRESS_308921] System (CPRS). Patients will be tested
on the outcome measures after the 20th session and at a 4 month
follow-up for comparison to the sham control group.
Follow-up Phase:
After the acute treatment phase ends, patients will enter a 4 month
follow-up period, and a total of one year monitoring period for
possible increased risk of seizure. If a participant in the active
treatment group continues to decline at the same rate as participants
in the control group at the end of 20 sessions of treatment, or drops
out during treatment, the participant will be considered a treatment
failure for the purpose of the primary analyses.

The proposed parameters are the most likely, based on current
knowledge, to be potentially effective in the VA population. The
specifics are:
Location: left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;
Power: 80 %of motor threshold as separately determined for each
patient prior to treatment/sham sessions;
Pulse frequency: triplet pulses repeating at 5 Hz
Length of each pulse train: 2 seconds;
Time between pulse trains: 8 seconds;
Length of treatment: about 5 minutes;
Total 600 pulses per session;
5 days/week, 20 sessions (completed in 2-4 weeks depending on
scheduling constraints ). Depending on schedule, and at physician's
discretion, up to three rTMS sessions can be scheduled per day with
at least a one hour interval between sessions.
Location & Intensity: rTMS studies in this area have used dosage
levels ranging from 90 %of motor threshold to 120 %of motor threshold
depending on the site selected for treatment stimulation. Older
studies used lower intensity stimulation because of safety concerns
at the time which have now been alleviated with greater experience.
In several recent studies, 120 %of motor threshold has been necessary
and sufficient to stimulate the prefrontal cortex in older
participants, even those with prefrontal atrophy. This threshold is
both tolerable and safe. The reason we have chosen the DLPFC is that
in a review of 8 studies of rTMS in dementia, all studies used this
target area, although two studies also treated other brain areas in
the same treatment period.
Sham(Control )treatment: This system, or something quite similar,
has been used in the CSP-556 OPT-TMS depression clinical trial and
several other smaller studies and the blind has been maintained.
Sham(Control )treatment will be accomplished by [CONTACT_253957]-B65-
A/P coil that functions both as an active (A)and placebo (P)coil.

each patient shall wear scalp electrodes through which, in the case
of sham treatments, a low-voltage, low electric current (2 – 20ma at
no more than 100V )will be passed in order to provide cutaneous
stimulation that mimics the sensation of actual rTMS. At the same
time, the Sham Noise Generator is used to hide the click noise
produced by [CONTACT_138410]. That is, when a magnetic stimulation pulse is
fired, white noise is sent to the ears of the patient. This sham
(white)noise will hide the click noise from all participants (active
or placebo ).
Biomarker collection and genetic testing:
We plan to collect indicators of the possible effects of rTMS of
brain derived nerve growth factors (BDNF). It has been shown that
val66met polymorphism in BDNF can affect the response to rTMS. For
this reason, the val66met polymorphism will be determined in each
subject. Furthermore, the amounts of BDNF in plasma and CSF will be
quantified. DNA samples will be purified from blood collection.
Blood samples will be obtained at the baseline visit and after
completion of the treatment. A venipuncture will be performed. A
maximum of 10 ml of blood will be withdrawn for analysis at any one
time. Subjects need not be fasting. DNA and proteins will be
extracted from the blood sample.
Optional CSF sample collection: Lumbar puncture (LP)will be done at
the baseline visit and after completion of the treatment. Risks will
be explained and consent obtained from the participant. The
procedure will be performed by a physician per standard proceedures
in a treatment room.
BDNF genotype will be determined through one-step amplified
refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR ), and
subsequent gel electrophoresis. BDNF, Val66Met will be determined

PCR amplicons will be analyzed on 2 %agarose gel. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_253929]. Plasma levels of BDNF will be
determined using Quantakine ELISA kits (R & D Systems ).
Rises in BDNF levels would be an indication of the rTMS effect if
this occurred only in the active treatment group. Apo-E and BDNF
genotypes will be used as moderator of the response. Consultant [CONTACT_254001] at VAPAHCS is experienced with collecting relevant
measures.
Optional structural MRI scanning: For MRI Guided TMS, participants
will undergo written informed consent, neurophsycological testing,
and then TMS. In an MRI guided TMS protocols that there will be 2-3
sessions where behavioral testing and MRI will precede TMS. The MRI
will be used to guide the TMS stimulation. This approach is a
structural MRI target (Talairach coordinates –45, 45, 35 )based on an
MRI guided TMS clinical trial that showed an advantage over a non-
image guided approach (5 cm rule ) (Fitzgerald et al., 2009 ). Thus we
will examine two approaches to target location: The 6 cm Rule, and a
structural MRI target location approach.

3. Background
a) Describe past experimental and/or clinical findings leading to the formulation of the study.
Clinical Background. Alzheimer's disease (AD)is extremely common
among older Veterans, and is the most frequent cause of dementia in
the general population. Current treatments for AD are of limited
effectiveness and do not halt the progression of the disease.
Recently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)has
emerged as a possible treatment for AD. It also has been asserted
that rTMS enhanced performance in cognitive functions in patients
with AD or mild cognitive impairment. Finally, rTMS has been found to
be effective to improve auditory comprehension in Alzheimer's
disease. Bentwich et al. (2011)found that rTMS improved performance
on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive (ADAS-cog )in
patients with dementia due to AD. Thus there appears to be some
evidence for clinical benefit to rTMS treatments in patients with
cognitive impairment possibly related to AD pathology.
Mechanism of Action. Studies show that rTMS may modify neuronal
networking functions beyond the site of stimulation. There are also
data indicating that externally applied electromagnetic field (rTMS)
not only changes the bioelectrical milieu locally, but also may
effect cerebral metabolism in sites distant to the local stimulus.
Such changes have been hypothesized to increase synaptic plasticity
and long-term potentiation (LTP)in areas important for cognitive
functioning in AD. In addition, rTMS has reversed a decline in brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)in mice, and caused increased
level of BDNF in chronic pain patients. More recently, it was found
that response to TMS is affected by [CONTACT_253964] (Chang 2014 )
and the Apo-e status modulates the changes in network connectivity
induced by [CONTACT_253965]-demented elders (Pena-Gomez
2015). Thus there is increasing knowledge about potential mechanisms
of action of rTMS in AD.
While not yet utilized in dementia research on a large scale, rTMS is
well suited for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_253931]. rTMS is currently being used at the VA Palo
Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS )and Stanford University in the
treatment of: executive dysfunction in Veterans with traumatic brain
injuries (VA Rehabilitation grant with notification of funding

9. Risks
a) For the following categories include a scientific estimate of the frequency, severity, and reversibility of potential
risks. Wherever possible, include statistical incidence of complications and the mortality rate of proposed
procedures. Where there has been insufficient time to accumulate significant data on risk, a statement to this
effect should be included. (In describing these risks in the consent form to the participant it is helpful to use
comparisons which are meaningful to persons unfamiliar with medical terminology. )
The risks of the Investigational devices.
Previously it was thought that RTMS studies carry little risk beyond occasionally causing a vascular
headache in participants susceptible to migraine. Safety studies in human participants have been concerned
with the theoretical possibility of magnetic injury to the brain, alteration in the baseline EEG, change in
cardiovascular stability, hormonal aberrations and persistent changes in cognitive or perceptual function. No
short or long-term sequelae have been described in these safety studies. A study in rabbits suggested that
transcranial magnetic stimulation has an auditory click that may raise the hearing threshold. Studies in
humans have found no evidence of hearing loss in humans due to TMS As a precaution ear plugs are used.
In 1995 the Food and Drug Administration determined that transcranial magnetic stimulators, delivering
less than one pulse a second, "does not now present a potential for serious risk to health."
However, one of our study participant developed seizure six months after he received RTMS treatment. We
are in the process of assessing if RTMS treatment contributed to this new onset of seizure. Before that issue
is clarified, we consider seizure is a potential risk for patients receiving RTMS.
MRI

The risks of the Procedures to be performed. Include all investigational, non-investigational and
non-invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, blood draws, treadmill tests ).
Venipuncture.
There is mild local discomfort associated with venipuncture, along with a risk of bruising or bleeding. On
very rare occasions there may be mild bleeding or bruising at the sampling site. Removal of blood by a
needle and syringe poses a small risk of pain or bruising at the site of the needle stick, but this is temporary.
Some people may experience fainting or dizziness, and there is also a slight risk of infection
at the site of the needle stick.
Cognitive testing.
Cognitive testing and psychosocial measurements can cause anxiety similar to what might be be associated
with any test. Repeated evaluations of mood and mental status may be
slightly frustrating or produce fatigue and boredom.
Lumbar puncture.
LP is a standard neurodiagnostic procedure for collection of CSF but may be associated with pain during the
performance of the procedure. This is usually temporary and confined to the lower back. A persistent
low-pressure headache may develop after lumbar puncture, probably due to leakage of CSF. Although
frequency of post-LP headache as high as 10 %has been reported using standard 20 gauge spi[INVESTIGATOR_243039],
rates of less than 2 %have been reported in elderly participants when atraumatic (Sprotte )needles are used
(Peskind et al, 2005 ). If a post-LP headache persists it may need additional treatment, e.g. with fluids and
analgesics. Uncommonly a blood patch (injection of some of the subject's blood to patch the CSF leak )may
be needed. Potential but rare risks of lumbar puncture include infection, damage to nerves in the back,
bleeding into the CSF space, and death. The risk of these is much less than 1 %.
Participants cannot participate in the optional LP if they are taking anticoagulants such as warfarin,
dabigatran, or FxA inhibitors, such as endoxaban, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], and rivaroxaban. Participants cannot participate
in the optional LP if they are on dual antiplatelet therapy-- with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_253935], such as
ticragelor, prasugrel, or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. Participants on a single antiplatelet agent, like ASA, will be
individually assessed to rule out factors that might increase bleeding risks. Participants on a P2Y12
inhibitor, such as tricragelor, prasugrel, or clopogrel, will be individually assessed to rule out factors that
might increase bleeding risks. Assessments will include lab reviews, such as PT, PTT, platelet count, etc.
MRI scans.

Genetic and Biomarker testing.
Genetic testing is done on the collected blood and CSF samples. Blood and CSF samples are to be brought
to a designated lab for biomarkers levels and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_48429], under the supervision of consultant, [CONTACT_254002].

In 1995 the Food and Drug Administration determined that transcranial magnetic stimulators, delivering
less than one pulse a second, "does not now present a potential for serious risk to health."
However, one of our study participant developed seizure six months after he received RTMS treatment. We
are in the process of assessing if RTMS treatment contributed to this new onset of seizure. Before that issue
is clarified, we consider seizure is a potential risk for patients receiving RTMS.

The risks of the Physical well-being.
See above procedures. No other risks to physical well-being are anticipated.
The risks of the Psychological well-being.
A screening will be performed to determine whether the participant meets inclusion and exclusion criteria
for the study. From past experience, potential risk to participants is expected to be minimal. Specifically,
questions asked may be potentially distressing to the participants or may cause them to think about
problems relating to them that may be anxiety-provoking or upsetting.
Cognitive Testing.
There do not appear to be any risks associated with cognitive testing other than the commitment of
significant time for participation. Some participants may experience anxiety during and after the cognitive
testing.
Biomarker and Genetic testing.
It is possible that bioassay and genetic testing could cause some psychological stress. However, all
participants are informed that only members of the research staff will see results of the biomarker and
genetic testing which will be in a coded format with no individual identification. We will not release results
of the genetic testing to anyone outside of the research project (including participants, family, physician, or

Title : Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Dementia
Approval Period: 01/31/2020 - 11/12/[ADDRESS_308930] found no evidence of hearing loss in humans due to TMS. In 1995 the Food and
Drug Administration determined that transcranial magnetic stimulators, delivering less than one pulse a
second, "does not now present a potential for serious risk to health." As a precaution ear plugs are used in
this study. Patients will wear soft earplugs with NRR of 30 dB or higher. Earphones that cover the ears (and
thus, also the ear plugs )will be used during rTMS sessions to provide sham noise. This setup should greatly
reduce the possibility of hearing loss. For patients who have subjective hearing changes during or after the
treatment, an audiology consultation will be requested on their behalf for further evaluation.

e) Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP). See guidance on Data Safety and Monitoring.
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)is required for studies that present Medium or High risk
to participants. (See Overall Evaluation of Risk above ). If Low Risk, a DSMP may not be necessary.
Multi-site Phase III clinical trials funded by [CONTACT_38364] a Data Safety
Monitoring Board or Committee (DSMC or DSMB ). The FDA recommends that all multi-site clinical
trials that involve interventions that have potential for greater than minimal risk to study participants
also have a DSMB or DSMC.
The role of the DSMC or DSMB is to ensure the safety of participants by [CONTACT_38365], and to oversee the validity and integrity of the data. Depending on the degree of risk and the
complexity of the protocol, monitoring may be performed by [CONTACT_38366], a board
(DSMC/DSMB ), a sponsor's Data Safety Committee (DSC), a Medical Monitor, a sponsor's safety
officer, or by [CONTACT_38367] (PD).
Describe the following:
What type of data and/or events will be reviewed under the monitoring plan, e.g. adverse events,
protocol deviations, aggregate data?
At each visit, participants will be asked about any adverse events that may have occurred since the last
visit. Information about adverse events (including any injuries, illnesses, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], deaths, or
suicides; this would include any adverse effects on sleep caused by [CONTACT_57219] )is collected at each

a) Describe the potential benefit (s)to be gained by [CONTACT_38371], etc.
rTMS could potentially generate substantial health benefits for VHA

Veterans with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, it could be disseminated
and delivered to both urban as well as to rural facilities, and in VA
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253940] (CBOC's ). In

a) Describe the informed consent process. Include the following.
i) Who is obtaining consent? (The person obtaining consent must be knowledgeable about the study. )
ii) When and where will consent be obtained?
iii) How much time will be devoted to consent discussion?
iv) Will these periods provide sufficient opportunity for the participant to consider whether or not to
participate and sign the written consent?
v) What steps are you taking to minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence?
vi) If consent relates to children and if you have a reason for only one parent signing, provide that
rationale for IRB consideration.
(i)The persons obtaining consent will be one of the investigators, the study coordinator, or a research
assistant, who have been trained to give informed consents. (ii)The consenting interview is always done
after the potential research subject (and, if required, the legally authorized representative )has been
presented with a description of the study and indicated interest in participating, and before any information
is collected, or any questionnaires answered. The consenting interview typi[INVESTIGATOR_253944]. (iii)Enough time will be allowed for the consent discussion for the
potential participant or LAR to make an informed decision, and to ask any and all questions they may have
and discuss the study with the researchers. We estimate this will take between 30 minutes and one hour. (iv)
The potential participant and LAR may take the consent home to discuss with family or others, and return
later to sign it if they so desire. (v)Every attempt will be made to ensure the participant and LAR does not
feel coerced. Participants are allowed as much time as needed to discuss the project with the research staff.
If desired by [CONTACT_2299], the signing of the consent is delayed for as long as needed to allow participants
to discuss the project with family, personal health care providers, or others. We believe that the payment
offered for participation is not great enough to entice a person to participate if they do not want to do so. (vi)

treatment, which is beyond the four months follow up period of the original protocol. The study team is
proposing to extend the post-treatment monitoring period from four months to one full year to assess the
risk of seizure associated with RTMS treatment. This re-consenting process will allow the study team to
have eight additional months (i.e., one full year counting from the last day of active RTMS treatment )to
monitor the occurrence of any events or symptoms the participants might have that may be suspi[INVESTIGATOR_253945] # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

seizure. The re-consent process will be done in the following manner: Study team will prepare the
re-consent form and a letter to the participant to explain the reason for re-consenting and the process
involved. Once approved, the study team will mail the participants the letter and updated consent, asking the
participant to sign and return. The study team will follow up by [CONTACT_648]. Once the study team receives the
signed re-consent from, the team member will countersign the document and send a copy back to the
veteran.
b) What is the Procedure to assess understanding of the information contained in the consent? How will
the information be provided to participants if they do not understand English or if they have a hearing
impairment? See HRPP Chapter12.[ADDRESS_308937] a good understanding of English, since the standardized forms, questionnaires, and
tests used are not currently available in other languages. Hearing impairment severe enough to impair
comprehension is an exclusion criteria for a similar reason.
c) What steps are you taking to determine that potential participants are competent to participate in the
decision-making process? If your study may enroll adults who are unable to consent, describe (i)how
you will assess the capacity to consent, (ii)what provisions will be taken if the participant regains the
capacity to consent, (iii)who will be used as a legally authorized representative, and (iv)what
provisions will be made for the assent of the participant.
We expect all persons with the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment who meet inclusion criteria will have
capacity to give informed consent. When in doubt, a trained clinician will make the competency evaluation
based on a brief clinical interview, according to VA guidelines. In most cases, the participant with the
diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is competent to give consent for research. If the person lacks
capacity, then a proxy (legally authorized representative )will need to sign the consent form. The patient's
assent will be obtained & documented by [CONTACT_224195]. Prospective participants
who meet diagnostic criteria of dementia will be deemed unable to give consent and a surrogate decision
maker has to give the consent. Cognitive impairment is not always associated with the lack of capacity for
informed consent to research. The majority of potential participants this study will have mild Alzheimer's
disease, and thus are expected to be capable of giving informed consent to participate in research. We will
first screen all potential participants using a telephone interview with the participant and/or caregiver, chart
review, or referral from treating physicians so that we have a rough idea of the participants general
cognitive status. When the participant and caregiver arrive study staff will first engage in conversation
designed to give a rough idea of the potential participant's general cognitive status. If there is any question
about a potential subject's capacity to give informed consent, they will be evaluated by [CONTACT_253981], and appropriate VA protocol will be followed, including, if indicated,
evaluation by [CONTACT_253982]. If the person lacks capacity (but is still eligible for the study ), then the
patient's assent will be obtained & documented, and a proxy (legally authorized representative, as specified
by [CONTACT_253983] )will need to sign the consent form. In any case, we will always go over the consent form
with both the participant and the caregiver/study partner. We feel a separate assent form is not needed for
this reason. We will follow the recommendations set out in the Alzheimer's Association position paper,
"Research Consent for Cognitively Impaired Individuals" (AD & Assoc Disorders 2004 (vol 18, pp
171-175 ) (attached ).
Additional VA questions:
i) List the people to whom you have formally delegated responsibility to obtain informed consent, and
state whether they have the appropriate training to perform this activity.
The persons obtaining consent will be one of the investigators, ([CONTACT_253998] )the study coordinator (TBN), or
a research assistant (TBN), all of whom have been trained to give informed consents. All staff have
completed the required training in Human Subjects, Good Clinical Practice, and HIPAA.
ii) Will legally effective informed consent be obtained from the participant or the participant's legally
authorized representative (LAR)or both? If LAR, is it clear who can serve as LAR?
Consent will be obtained from the participant. All participants involved in the study will be able to
participate in the decision-making process by [CONTACT_253984]/or mental illness. If a potential subject's competency is in question, a trained
clinician will make the competency evaluation based on a brief clinical interview, according to VA
guidelines. In most cases, the participant is competent to give consent for research. If the person lacks
capacity, then the patient's assent will be obtained and documented, and a proxy (informed legally
authorized representative )will be asked to sign the consent form. The LAR is usually the study partner (a
spouse or adult child of the participant ).
iii) Will the circumstances of the consent process minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence
and provide the prospective participant or their representative sufficient opportunity to consider
whether to participate?Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

iv) Will the circumstances of the consent process minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence?
Participants are allowed as much time as needed to discuss the project with the research staff. If desired by
[CONTACT_2299], the signing of the consent is delayed for as long as needed to allow participants to discuss
the project with family, personal health care providers, or others.
v) Will the information being communicated to the participant or the representative during the consent
process exclude any exculpatory language through which the participant or the representative is made
to waive or appear to waive the participant's legal rights, or release or appear to release the
investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agent from liability for negligence (e.g. I give up any
property rights I may have in bodily fluids or tissue samples obtained in the course of the research )?
All information presented to the participant, including anything they must sign, has been approved by [CONTACT_134040].
vi) Please confirm the following:
a. A witness to the participant's signature [CONTACT_138465]'s legally authorized representative's
signature [CONTACT_138466].
b. If the sponsor or the IRB requires a witness to the consenting process in addition to the witness to
the participant's signature [CONTACT_138467], a note to that
effect is placed under the witness's signature [CONTACT_4548].

a) Describe the informed consent process. Include the following.
i) Who is obtaining consent? (The person obtaining consent must be knowledgeable about the study. )
ii) When and where will consent be obtained?
iii) How much time will be devoted to consent discussion?
iv) Will these periods provide sufficient opportunity for the participant to consider whether or not to
participate and sign the written consent?
v) What steps are you taking to minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence?
vi) If consent relates to children and if you have a reason for only one parent signing, provide that
rationale for IRB consideration.
(i)The person conducting the phone screen will be one of the investigators, the study coordinator, phone
screens and consents. (ii)The phone screen is always done after the potential participant indicated interest in
participating, and before any information is collected, or any questionnaires answered. (iii)Enough time
will be allowed for the consent discussion for the potential participant to make an informed decision, and to
ask any and all questions they may have and discuss the study with the researchers. We estimate this will
take around 30 minutes. (iv)The potential participant may stop the phone interview to discuss with family
or others, and call back later to complete it if they so desire. (v)Every attempt will be made to ensure the
participant does not feel coerced. Participants are allowed as much time as needed to discuss the project
with the research staff. The potential participant is free to stop the interview or hang up the phone at any
time.(vi)Not applicable.
b) What is the Procedure to assess understanding of the information contained in the consent? How will
the information be provided to participants if they do not understand English or if they have a hearing
impairment? See HRPP Chapter12.[ADDRESS_308939] a good understanding of English, since the standardized forms, questionnaires, and tests used are
not currently available in other languages. Hearing impairment severe enough to impair comprehension is
an exclusion criteria for a similar reason.
c) What steps are you taking to determine that potential participants are competent to participate in the
decision-making process? If your study may enroll adults who are unable to consent, describe (i)how
you will assess the capacity to consent, (ii)what provisions will be taken if the participant regains the
capacity to consent, (iii)who will be used as a legally authorized representative, and (iv)what
provisions will be made for the assent of the participant.Protocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

giving informed consent to participate in research. We will first screen all potential participants using our
standard telephone interview We will follow the recommendations set out in the Alzheimer's Association
position paper, "Research Consent for Cognitively Impaired Individuals" (AD & Assoc Disorders 2004 (vol
18, pp 171-175 ) (attached ).
Additional VA questions:
i) List the people to whom you have formally delegated responsibility to obtain informed consent, and
state whether they have the appropriate training to perform this activity.
The persons conducting the phone interview will be one of the investigators, ([CONTACT_253998] )the study
coordinator (TBN), or a research assistant (TBN), all of whom have been trained to give informed consents.
All staff have completed the required training in Human Subjects, Good Clinical Practice, and HIPAA.
ii) Will legally effective informed consent be obtained from the participant or the participant's legally
authorized representative (LAR)or both? If LAR, is it clear who can serve as LAR?
Consent will be obtained from the participant. All participants involved in the study will be competent to
participate in the decision-making process as we are excluding individuals with serious dementia and/or
mental illness. If a potential subject's competency is in question, the phone interview will be ended.
iii) Will the circumstances of the consent process minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence
and provide the prospective participant or their representative sufficient opportunity to consider
whether to participate?
Participants are allowed as much time as needed to discuss the project with the research staff. If desired by

The Protocol Director agrees to:
• Adhere to principles of sound scientific research designed to yield valid results
• Conduct the study according to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_1201]
• Be appropriately qualified to conduct the research and be trained in Human Research protection, ethical
principles, regulations, policies and procedures
• Ensure all Stanford research personnel are adequately trained and supervised
• Ensure that the rights and welfare of participants are protected including privacy and confidentiality of data
• Ensure that, when de-identified materials are obtained for research purposes, no attempt will be made to
re-identify them.
• Disclose to the appropriate entities any potential conflict of interest
• Report promptly any new information, modification, or unanticipated problems that raise risks to
participants or others
• Apply relevant professional standards.
Any change in the research protocol must be submitted to the IRB for review prior to the implementation of
such change. Any complications in participants or evidence of increase in the original estimate of risk should
be reported at once to the IRB before continuing with the project. Inasmuch as the Institutional Review
Board(IRB)includes faculty, staff, legal counsel, public members, and students, protocols should be written
in language that can be understood by [CONTACT_38388]. The investigators must inform the participants of
any significant new knowledge obtained during the course of the research.
IRB approval of any project is for a maximum period of one year. For continuing projects and activities, it is
the responsibility of the investigator (s)to resubmit the project to the IRB for review and re-approval prior toProtocol # [ZIP_CODE] ( Modification ) PROTOCOL

All data including signed consent form documents must be retained for a minimum of three years past the
completion of the research. Additional requirements may be imposed by [CONTACT_38389], your
department, or other entities. (Policy on Retention of and Access to Research Data, Research Policy

PLEASE NOTE: List all items (verbatim )that you want to be reflected in your approval letter (e.g.,
Amendment, Investigator's Brochure, consent form (s), advertisement, etc. )in the box below. Include number
and date when appropriate.
A document named "Statistical Analysis Plan" is being submitted for IRB's review. Per ClinicalTrials.gov,
this is required for reporting clinical trial results to ClinicalTrials.gov. This document reads:
===========================================================
RTMS for Dementia Statistical analyses Plan:
Primary Hypothesis 1 (Primary Memory Outcome ): rTMS will lead to higher performance on the [LOCATION_004]
Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II )compared to performance by [CONTACT_253953].
Secondary Hypothesis 2 (Secondary Cognitive Outcomes ): rTMS- will lead to higher performance on
secondary cognitive measures relating to language (Animal Fluency and [LOCATION_011] Naming Test, BNT ), visual
memory (Brief Visual Memory Test, BVMT )and executive functioning and processing speed (Trail making
A&B), compared to performance by [CONTACT_253987].
Secondary Hypothesis 3 (Exploration of Mechanism of Action ): rTMS-induced memory improvement
parallels changes in BDNF levels after treatment.
Mixed model analysis will be used to compare performance on the primary neuropsychological measures
(CVLT-II Long-Delay Free Recall and Cued Recall and CVLT Short-Delay Free Recall and Cued Recall )by
[CONTACT_253988] [ADDRESS_308945] (BVMT )and Trail making
A&B.
We expect that changes in BDNF measures relating to neuronal plasticity over the course of treatment may
account for some of the observed effects of rTMS on memory. Therefore, mixed model analysis will also be
used to compare BDNF levels at baseline and after the RTMS treatment.

Title  Evaluation of Tofacitinib  in Prevention of Photosensitivity in Cutaneous 
Lupus Erythematosus 
Clinical Phase  Phase I 
Number of Sites  1-3 
Sponsor/ IND Number  DAIT/NIAID , NIH /IND #154164, IND -Exempt 
Study Objectives  Primary Objective  
1. To determine whether a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib impacts 
photosensitivity following UVB exposure in individuals with cutaneous 
lupus erythematosus (CLE). 
Secondary Objectives 
1. To evaluate changes in cutaneous disease activity in individuals with 
CLE after a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib. 
2. To evaluate changes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease 
activity in individuals with CLE after a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib. 
3. To evaluate safety and toxicity of a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib for 
individuals with CLE. 
Study Design  This is a single -arm, multi -site, proof -of-concept study of 10 participants 
with CLE. Consenting individuals meeting all entry criteria will undergo 25 
days of treatment with tofacitinib (11 mg orally (PO) daily) with evaluation 
of UVB-mediated cutaneous apoptosis and ancillary mechanistic studies 
before and after treatment.  Post-screening study visits will be conducted 
on Days 0 (Visit 1), 1 (Visit 2), 14 (Visit 3), 25 (Visit 4), 26 (Visit 5), and 40 
(Visit 6) to (1) evaluate adverse events, vital signs, hematology and 
chemistry, study drug compliance, medication use, and disease status, (2) 
conduct UVB phototesting, and (3) collect skin biopsies and blood samples 
for mechanistic studies. Tofacitinib will be distributed to eligible 
participants at Visit 2 (Day 1) and the first dose will be taken on Day 2. The 
last dose is the morning of Visit 5 (Day 26). Participants are allowed to 
continue on their stable background therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622946] 7.1.2, Other Permitted Concomitant Medications . 
Please refer to Section 8.1.1, Exceptions to Visit Windows , and Section 6.6,  
Resumption of Investigational Product,  for more information regarding

SLEDAI -2K Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity I ndex  [ADDRESS_829588] :  Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light can serve as a trigger for cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease flares[1] making it one of the few definitive known triggers for these 
diseases. Complicating our ability to treat UV light-induced cutaneous and systemic lupus disease flares is an incomplete 
understanding of the mechanisms which drive this phenomenon. Targeted systemic treatment to reduce the effect of 
UV light would be a novel and important mechanism for reduction in disease flare rate and potentially even treatment 
of these patients.     
Scientific Rationale of Proposed Study: UV light is a known trigger of CLE lesions[2] and induces apoptosis through 
several pathways[3]. It has been reported that CLE lesions are characterized by [CONTACT_622987][4]. One hypothesis 
on the etiology of CLE lesions is that increased apoptosis following ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure of “normal skin” leads to 
autoantigen exposure in an environment where antigen clearance is impaired (as in lupus)[5]. This coupled with a robust 
keratinocyte-mediated inflammatory response promotes inflammatory cell recruitment to the skin where autoantigens 
are taken up, processed, and presented to autoreactive T cells.   Interferon kappa (IFNκ) is overexpressed in non-lesional 
lupus skin and is a key regulator of apoptotic responses to UVB. Indeed, enhanced UVB-driven apoptosis can be induced 
by [CONTACT_622988]κ in N/TERT keratinocytes.  Further, deletion of IFNκ is sufficient to significantly impair UVB-
mediated apoptosis[6]. This suggests that the level of IFNκ present can serve as a rheostat for UVB-mediated apoptosis. 
Indeed, in non-lesional keratinocytes, enhanced apoptosis in SLE versus control can be abrogated by [CONTACT_622989] I IFN 
signaling via a Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor[6]. Patients with isolated CLE lesions and those with CLE as a manifestation 
of SLE exhibit high levels of IFNκ in their skin lesions, and both groups of patients have indistinguishable cutaneous IFN 
signatures [6, 7]. Thus, in CLE-prone skin, photosensitive reactions driven by [CONTACT_622990]κ and are potentially inhibited through blockade of IFN signaling via JAK 
inhibition.   
There is a gap in our knowledge regarding how non-lesional skin of individuals with CLE responds to UV light and 
whether blockade of IFN signaling will alleviate photosensitivity.   Small trials and case reports have suggested that 
tofacitinib is beneficial in SLE and CLE patients, but none of these studies have evaluated photosensitivity as part of their 
studies[8] [9, 10]. This study will provide information on how JAK blockade impacts photosensitive responses and 
whether this strategy could be considered as a prophylactic measure to prevent cutaneous and systemic lupus flares. As 
CLE is a known manifestation of photosensitive reactions, we will study CLE patients for this trial. 
 
1.2. Rationale for Selection of Investigational Product 
What is the nature of the product to be tested? Tofacitinib is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
JAK3/JAK1 inhibitor that is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and 
polyarticular course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pcJIA). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_622953]3 and JAK1 signaling, it is able 
to inhibit type I IFN signaling and IL-6 pathways with equal efficacy to baricitinib, where JAK1 is its primary target [11]. 
Based on published data, which shows blockade of JAK1 signaling in vitro  normalizes SLE keratinocyte cell death after 
UVB [6], we hypothesize that treating individuals with CLE with tofacitinib will reduce UVB-mediated apoptosis and 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page [ADDRESS_829589] on disease mechanisms.  
Xeljanz®(tofacitinib) 5 mg BID and Xeljanz® XR (tofacitinib) [ADDRESS_829590] shown equivalent efficacy[12]. For this protocol, Xeljanz® XR 11 mg once daily was selected as the dosing regimen 
in order to reduce the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_622954] a daily basis and thus increase compliance 
with dosing . Twenty-five days of dosing was chosen to provide for normalization of steady state levels with once daily 
dosing while limiting the overall exposure to the medication. Steady state of Xeljanz® XR 11 mg occurs within 5 days of 
dosing[13] to levels sufficient to inhibit peripheral immune signaling[14]. However, tissue penetration and signaling 
effects in the skin may require longer exposure, thus the 25-day dosing regimen prior to phototesting will be employed 
in this study.  
Advantages of Using Tofacitinib 
1. Once daily dosing 
2. Has been tested in small Phase I/II study of SLE patients without safety signals[8]. 
3. FDA approved for other autoimmune conditions, i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, 
and pcJIA, with extensive safety profile in these conditions. 
1.3. Preclinical Experience 
Murine studies support potential efficacy in lupus. In lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, treatment with tofacitinib results in 
improvement of cutaneous lesions as well as a decreased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_622955][15]. Additional follow-up murine 
studies in the MRL/lpr model have shown that tofacitinib impairs the survival and effector functions of pathogenic CD8+ T 
resident memory cells[16]. In an interferon-driven model of murine lupus, NZB/NZW F 1, tofacitinib also reduced 
interferon signatures and improvement in nephritis[17]. 
1.4. Clinical Studies 
Tofacitinib is FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and pcJIA, and 
dosed at 5 mg twice daily (BID) or 11 mg daily (extended release, XR). Tofacitinib is not currently approved for use in CLE 
or SLE patients. A Phase I/II study which enrolled 30 SLE patients with mild to moderate disease activity to assess safety 
in SLE patients (no skin measurements taken) with 56 days of active drug treatment of 5 mg BID, did not identify any 
serious adverse events (SAE) and there was no increase in adverse events over placebo[8]. A case series also reported 
partial to complete efficacy for skin and arthritis in 10 patients with SLE treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID[18]. Currently, 
there are several additional small studies of tofacitinib: one with plans to enroll 12 adult discoid lupus erythematosus 
(DLE) patients  in an open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_622956][19]; one enrolling 20 young (18-30 years) patients 
with CLE for pharmacodynamics studies. Data from dose-ranging studies in SLE are not available. No long-term studies to 
evaluate toxicology or efficacy in lupus patients have yet been performed.

ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 2. Study Hypotheses/Objectives 
2.1. Hypotheses 
In individuals with CLE, a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib will: 
 reduce UVB-mediated cutaneous apoptosis,  
 reduce UVB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription, and  
 increase minimal erythema dose (MED) after UVB exposure. 
2.2. Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to determine whether a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib impacts photosensitivity following 
UVB exposure in individuals with CLE. 
 
Photosensitivity parameters will be measured before and after tofacitinib treatment and will include: UVB-mediated 
cutaneous apoptosis, UVB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription, and MED in response to UVB exposure. 
2.3. Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are as follows: 
 To evaluate changes in cutaneous disease activity in individuals with CLE after a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib. 
 To evaluate changes in SLE activity in individuals with CLE after a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib. 
 To evaluate safety and toxicity of a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib for individuals with CLE. 
3. Study Design  
3.1. Description of Study Design 
This is a single-arm, multi-site, proof-of-concept study of 10 participants with CLE.  Consenting individuals meeting all 
entry criteria will undergo 25 days of treatment with tofacitinib (11 mg orally (PO) daily) with evaluation of UVB-
mediated cutaneous apoptosis and ancillary mechanistic studies before and after treatment.  Post-screening study visits 
will be conducted on Days 0 (Visit 1), 1 (Visit 2), 14 (Visit 3), 25 (Visit 4), 26 (Visit 5), and 40 (Visit 6) to (1) evaluate 
adverse events, vital signs, hematology and chemistry, study drug compliance, medication use, and disease status, (2) 
conduct UVB phototesting, and (3) collect skin biopsies and blood samples for mechanistic studies (See Figure 1).  
Tofacitinib will be distributed to eligible participants at Visit 2 (Day 1) and the first dose will be taken on Day 2. The last 
dose is the morning of Visit 5 (Day 26). Participants are allowed to continue on their stable background therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622957] 7.1.2, Other Permitted Concomitant Medications .  
Please refer to Section 8.1.1, Exceptions to Visit Windows , and Section 6.6,  Resumption of Investigational Product,  for 
more information regarding delays to visits 4 and 5.

Figure 1. Study Schematic  
3.1.1.  Considerations Regarding COVID-19 
May 11, 2023, marked the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) declaration in the US. The CDC states 
that many people in the [LOCATION_002] now have some protection or immunity against COVID-19 due to vaccination, 
previous infection, or both. This immunity, combined with the availability of tests and treatments, has greatly reduced 
the risk of severe illness, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death from COVID-19 for many people 
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html ).  
At the same time, some people—such as those who are older, are immunocompromised, have certain disabilities, or 
have certain underlying health conditions—continue to be at higher risk for serious illness. Mitigating risks of 
infections, including from endemic COVID-19, in immunocompromised populations remains important.  
Participants are strongly recommended to be up to date with COVID-[ADDRESS_829591] 14 days prior to Visit 1 (Day 0). 
3.2. Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the change in percentage of UVB-induced apoptotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_622958] 2 (Day 1) (pre-
treatment) to Visit 5 (Day 26) (post-treatment). Percentage of UVB-induced apoptotic cells at a visit is defined as the 
difference between the percentage of apoptotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_622959]-exposed biopsy and percentage of apoptotic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_622960]. More information can be found in Section 8.5.5, Research 
Assessments .

study, may interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the 
quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study. 
5. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Participants 
5.1. Risks of Tofacitinib as cited in US Package Insert 
The following are considered important risks or potential risks identified in the [LOCATION_002] Prescribing 
Information (USPI) for XELJANZ®(tofacitinib) and XELJANZ® XR (tofacitinib)[20]: 
1. Serious infections: Tofacitinib increases the risk of serious infections leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059], 
including TB and bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections. The most common serious 
infections reported include pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, and 
appendicitis. Among opportunistic infections, TB and other mycobacterial infections, cryptococcosis, 
histoplasmosis, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystsis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus 
infections, BK virus infection, and listeriosis have been reported. In addition, disseminated infections have been 
reported, and were often associated with concurrent use of immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate 
or corticosteroids.  Other serious infections that have not been reported in clinical studies may also occur.  
 
2. Mortality: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), individuals with at least one cardiovascular risk factor had a higher risk 
of all-cause mortality including sudden cardiovascular death. 
3. Malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders:  In rheumatoid arthritis, higher rates of malignancies (excluding 
non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed, particularly among current and past smokers. Risks and benefits of 
treatment should be weighed prior to initiating therapy in individuals with a known malignancy other than a 
successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer.  
4. Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE):  RA patients [ADDRESS_829602] one 
cardiovascular risk factor had a higher rate of MACE defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial 
infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke. Risks and benefits of treatment should be weighed prior to initiating or 
continuing therapy, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other 
cardiovascular risk factors. 
5. Thrombosis: Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis have 
occurred. RA patients [ADDRESS_829603] one cardiovascular risk factor had an observed 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 23 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 increase in incidence of these events, many of which were serious and some resulting in death. Tofacitinib 
should be avoided in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. 
6. Gastrointestinal perforations:  Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported. Caution is warranted in 
individuals who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., those with a history of 
diverticulitis or taking Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs).  
7. Hypersensitivity : Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and urticaria that may reflect drug 
hypersensitivity have been observed including some serious events. 
8. Laboratory Abnormalities : 
Lymphocyte abnormalities: Tofacitinib has been associated with a gradual decrease in mean absolute 
lymphocyte counts of approximately 10% over 12 months of therapy. Lymphocyte counts less than 500 
cells/mm were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections. 
Neutropenia: Tofacitinib has been associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 
cells/mm). 
Anemia: Avoid initiation of tofacitinib in individuals with low hemoglobin level (i.e., < 9 g/dL). 
Liver enzyme elevations: Tofacitinib has been associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation. 
Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs 
(DMARDs) (primarily methotrexate) therapy. 
Lipid elevations: Tofacitinib has been associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters including 
total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. 
Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. There were no clinically relevant changes in 
LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality has not been determined. 
9. Gastrointestinal obstruction : As with any other non-deformable material, caution should be used when 
administering tofacitinib to individuals with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or 
iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in 
association with the ingestion of other drugs utilizing a non-deformable extended-release formulation. 
The following additional considerations are noted in the USPI: 
1. Drug interactions:   
 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase exposure to tofacitinib. Participants taking ketoconazole are excluded 
from this study.  
2. Co-administration with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or 
cyclosporine is not recommended.  
3. Pregnancy, Lactation, and Reproductive potential:  
 Available data in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug associated risk of major birth defects, 
miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Feticidal and teratogenic effects were noted in animal 
reproduction studies. 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 24 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023  There are no data on the presence of tofacitinib in human milk, the effects on a breastfed infant, or the 
effects on milk production. Tofacitinib is present in the milk of lactating rats; it is likely that the drug will be 
present in human milk. 
 Pregnancy planning and prevention is recommended for females of reproductive potential and is planned 
for this study. 
4. Vaccinations:  Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with tofacitinib. The interval between live vaccinations 
and initiation of tofacitinib therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding 
immunosuppressive agents.  
5. Hepatic impairment:  Tofacitinib has not been studied in individuals with severe hepatic impairment and its use 
is not recommended. In studies of individuals with moderate hepatic impairment, tofacitinib blood 
concentration than is higher than individuals with normal hepatic function. Higher blood concentrations may 
increase the risk of some adverse reactions. In addition, the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib have not been 
studied in patients with positive hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus serology. 
6. Renal impairment:  In individuals with moderate or severe renal impairment, tofacitinib blood concentrations 
are higher than in individuals with normal renal function.  
5.2. Risks of Tofacitinib cited in Medical Literature and FDA Drug Safety Communications  
As noted in Section 1.4, Clinical Studies , the clinical experience of using tofacitinib in lupus patients is limited.  A recent 
report of 10 SLE patients with active skin disease who were treated with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily for varying time 
points of 4 weeks to one year identified two adverse events.  One patient had an outbreak of Herpes Zoster, the other 
experienced alopecia.  It was not reported as to whether these events were considered related to tofacitinib as all 
patients in the study were on combination therapy with seven out of ten on concomitant corticosteroids and seven out 
of ten on concomitant immunosuppressive medications such as mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, or 
methotrexate[21]. Case reports of successful treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus overlap made no 
mention of adverse events[22]. Preliminary reports of a 56-day active treatment phase 1b/2a safety study of tofacitinib 
5 mg twice daily in patients with systemic lupus identified no severe adverse events or opportunistic infections.  Total 
infections were reported in 55% of patients on tofacitinib and 40% of those on placebo[8], and most of these were 
reported as mild upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. 
5.3. Risks of Other Protocol Specified Medications 
Not applicable. 
5.4. Risks of Study Procedures  
1. Storage of skin and blood samples: Specimens will be identified with a participant-specific code number.  
Safeguards are used to protect the risk to participant’s privacy as outlined in Section 17.3, Privacy and 
Confidentiality.  
2. Blood draw: Drawing blood from a vein may cause some discomfort, bleeding, or bruising, and rarely, infection 
or fainting at puncture site.  A total of 210mL (about 7 oz.) of blood will be collected over the course of the 
entire study.  Blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_622993].  
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 25 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 3. Skin biopsy: The risks include discomfort, e.g., pain, pruritus, and/or bruising at the site of biopsy during 
numbing of the skin or after the anesthetic has worn off, and allergic reactions to lidocaine.  A small amount of 
bleeding may occur during the biopsy, and bleeding may be increased in participants taking blood thinners such 
as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_622961].  Rarely, biopsy sites may develop a skin infection.  Biopsy sites may also result in small 
scars, and those with a history of scarring after skin trauma may be at increased risk of scarring.  
4. Ultraviolet Light Exposure: Part of this study includes a brief exposure to different doses of UV light (up to 80 
mJ/cm2). The areas exposed are small (about 1 cm2), but there is a risk of some burning sensation in the areas 
exposed.  In addition, it is possible that skin inflammation following the UV light exposure could linger and 
cause a rash.  
5.5. Summary of Potential Benefits 
There is no direct benefit to participants. This is a proof-of-concept study with a short course of study drug.  
Findings from the proposed studies will provide new information regarding the mechanisms of photosensitivity in lupus 
and the potential ways to treat it. The new information generated from this trial may lead to new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622962].   
6. Investigational Agent /Device/Intervention  
6.1. Investigational Agents

food. Tofacitinib tablets should be swallowed whole and intact, do not crush, split or chew[20] .  
6.2. Drug Accountability 
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator will maintain adequate records of the 
disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was 
dispensed (participant-by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately 
destroyed. 
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  A drug-dispensing log will be kept 
current for each participant.  This log will contain the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of drug 
dispensed. 
All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection. 
6.3. Assessment of Participant Compliance with Investigational Agent 
Participants will be asked to return to the clinic with their study drug pi[INVESTIGATOR_622964] 3 
(Day 14), Visit 4 (Day 25), and Visit 5 (Day 26).  Compliance will be evaluated at Visit 4 (Day 25) before initiating 
phototesting (See Section 3.1, Description of Study Design ).  Participants will take their last dose of study medication on 
the morning of Visit 5 (Day 26).  At Visit 5 (Day 26), bottles will be collected by [CONTACT_6624], and pi[INVESTIGATOR_622965].  
Participants who fail to return their pi[INVESTIGATOR_338886] 5 will be asked to return the bottles at Visit 6 (Day 40).  
6.4. Toxicity Prevention and Management 
Prevention 
 Entry criteria and laboratory testing are designed to exclude individuals with identifiable risk factors.  
 Participants will be informed of the need to be up-to-date with respect to vaccinations per current immunization 
guidelines. They will be asked to confirm their vaccination status with their provider before enrolling in this 
study.  Vaccination of participants with live components is prohibited within the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Day 0), 
during treatment, or during the [ADDRESS_829604] 2 weeks prior to initiation of study drug and should not be administered during 
treatment or during the one month after completion of study drug.  
 Concurrent use of drugs that are contradicted with tofacitinib 11 mg per day is prohibited while on study 
treatment (See Section 7.3, Prohibited Medications ).  
 Safety monitoring will serve to monitor for adverse events that require further evaluation and/or treatment. 
Management  Participants will be seen in clinic on Day 14, approximately 2 weeks after starting study drug, to evaluate signs 
and symptoms and screen for possible adverse events. 
 Participants will be instructed to call the study coordinator if signs or symptoms of an infection occur during the 
course of the study.  
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 27 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023  Prior to biopsies, participants will be asked about allergies to local anesthetics and solutions used to prepare the 
biopsy site.  A stitch will be used to close the skin biopsy site to minimize the risk of infection and scar formation. 
Biopsies will be performed using sterile techniques by [CONTACT_32341], and participants will be provided with 
wound care instructions to minimize the risk of infection.  
6.5. Discontinuation/Suspension of Investigational Agent 
6.5.1.  Permanent Discontinuation of Investigational Agent 
Participants MUST permanently discontinue tofacitinib for any of the following reasons:  
1. The participant elects to withdraw consent for study treatment.  
2. The participant loses the ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary commitment for 
treatment of a psychiatric condition. 
3. The participant becomes pregnant.  
4. The participant experiences anaphylaxis or a Grade [ADDRESS_829605] > 3X ULN and total bilirubin > 2X ULN (Hy’s Law).  
If a participant prematurely discontinues study therapy, all subsequent study visits will be cancelled with the 
exception of Visit 6 (Day 40). The participant will be asked to return for an in-person safety follow-up Visit 6 (Day 
40) if the safety event that led to the permanent discontinuation of study treatment was related to study 
participation. The participant will be asked to participate in a virtual or telephone safety follow-up Visit 6 (Day 40) if 
the discontinuation of study treatment was not due to an adverse event related to study participation. See Table 
8.2, Schedule of Events , for more detail. 
6.5.2.  Temporary Suspension of Investigational Agent 
Participants MUST temporarily suspend tofacitinib for any of the following reasons:  
1. The participant experiences a clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued treatment with study drug is not in the best interest of the 
participant.  
2. The participant develops a SAE as defined in Section 12.2.4, Serious Adverse Events . 
3. The participant develops any grade 2 or higher infection.  
4. The participant is diagnosed with an active SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, confirmed by [CONTACT_622995], independent of symptoms or grade of infection. 
5. The participant develops a fever >101oF. 
6. The participant requires an increase in dose of a permitted background lupus medication as defined in Section 
7.1.2, Other Permitted Concomitant Medications . 
7. If a participant is found to have any of the following lab values (from either unscheduled clinic visits or 
evaluations outside this study): 
 Lymphocyte count <0.50 x 109/L  
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 28 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1.0 x 109/L  
 Hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL or a decrease > 2 g/dL from Visit 1 (Day 0).  
6.6. Resumption of Investigational Product 
Tofacitinib should be taken as prescribed, unless a participant has an event that requires premature discontinuation or 
temporary suspension, as outlined in Section 6.5, Discontinuation/Suspension of Investigational Agent . If a participant 
inadvertently misses one to seven consecutive doses, the participant should resume tofacitinib as soon as possible. If a 
participant is required to temporarily suspend tofacitinib as outlined in 6.5.2, Temporary Suspension of Investigational 
Agent,  the participant may resume tofacitinib once the event leading to dose suspension resolves and/or stabilizes, 
provided visits 4 and 5 will occur within 12 weeks after the participant’s Visit 1 (Day 0) and the investigator feels 
resumption of tofacitinib is appropriate.  
In order to achieve the study drug compliance criteria, as described in Section 8.5.5, Research Assessments , one 
additional bottle of tofacitinib may be dispensed. If it is necessary to start a new 25-day course of tofacitinib (e.g. 
substantial study therapy non-adherence or suspension of study therapy for 8 or more consecutive days), the participant 
must undergo a Restart Visit and meet all entry criteria listed in Sections 4.2 Inclusion Criteria and 4.3  Exclusion Criteria,  
prior to starting the new course of tofacitinib. Visits 4 (Day 25) and 5 (Day 26) must occur within 12 weeks after the 
participant’s Visit 1 (Day 0).  A participant may only start a new 25-day course of tofacitinib once. For more information, 
see Table 8.2, Schedule of Events. 
If resumption of tofacitinib is not appropriate, the procedures outlined in 6.5.1, Permanent Discontinuation of 
Investigational Agent , should be followed. 
7. Other Medications 
7.1. Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medication taken during the study must be recorded with generic name [CONTACT_11889], indication, 
daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration.  A participant who is receiving an allowed concomitant 
medication for any reason must be on a dose that is considered standard-of-care for the treated indication.  Medications 
taken after informed consent is obtained but before the first dose of study medication will be documented as prior 
medications.  Medications taken after the first dose of study drug has been administered will be documented as 
concomitant medications. 
7.1.1.  Protocol-mandated 
There are no protocol-mandated concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622966]. 
7.1.2.  Other Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Participants are allowed to continue on the following background lupus therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622967] (as indicated) 
that have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Day 0). Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_622968]. Increasing doses of these background lupus therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (other than PRN 
NSAIDs) is not permitted. See Section 6.5.2, Temporary Suspension of Investigational Agent , for more details.

8.1.1.  Exception to Visit Window Rules 
For participants who complete phototesting and the biopsy at Visit 1 (Day 0) and Visit 2 (Day 1), Visit 4 (Day 25) may 
be delayed up to 12 weeks after Visit 1 (Day 0), if necessary.  This may occur if study therapy compliance criteria, as 
described in Section 8.5.5, Research Assessments , have not been met.  
If it is necessary to start a new 25-day course of tofacitinib as described in Section 6.6, Resumption of Investigational 
Product , the participant will have a virtual visit 14 days after reinitiating tofacitinib to assess adverse events. 
8.2. Screening and Enrollment 
The study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. The potential participant will sign an 
informed consent form before undergoing any study procedures.  Once informed consent is obtained, all screening 
procedures, assessments, and laboratory measures to determine participant eligibility will be conducted within a 30-day 
screening window. Eligible participants who meet all entry criteria will proceed with treatment, visits, and assessments 
according to Table 8.2, Schedule of Events .  See Section 8.5, Study Procedures and Assessments  for more information on 
individual clinical and research assessments. Participants who do not meet eligibility criteria will be permitted to 
rescreen once. In addition, participants who cannot complete visits 4 (Day 25) and 5 (Day 26) within 12 weeks after the 
participant’s Visit 1 (Day 0) may rescreen and start the study over, if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. The 
participant must be off tofacitinib for at least one month prior to the new baseline phototesting and biopsy. 
8.3. Unscheduled Visits  
The investigator may schedule visits in addition to those listed in Table 8.2, Schedule of Events  in order to conduct 
evaluations or assessments required to protect the well-being of the participant. If disease activity increases or other 
concerns arise between regularly scheduled visits, participants should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_622996] “unscheduled” visit.   
8.4. Early Termination Visits 
An Early Termination Visit should be requested for participants who withdraw from the study prior to Visit 4 (Day 25).  
See Table 8.2, Schedule of Events,  for more information about the assessments that should be conducted at an Early 
Termination Visit.  
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 31 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 8.5. Study Procedures and Assessments 
8.5.1.  Study Drug 
 Study drug will be dispensed to eligible participants at Visit 2 (Day 1).  Dosing will begin on day 2 and end on day 
26 prior to the erythema assessment and biopsy at Visit 5 (Day 26). 
 Study drug compliance will be evaluated at Visit 3 (Day 14).  
 Study drug compliance will be evaluated at Visit 4 (Day 25) prior to phototesting. 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_622969], and remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_622970] 5 (Day 26). 
8.5.2.  General Assessments 
 Informed Consent 
 Demographics: Participants should provide demographic information. In particular, race and ethnicity should be 
self-identified.  
 Medical History:  Medical history will be performed as part of screening activities and standard medical care. 
The medical history assessment will include current illnesses/conditions and past medical history. 
 Concomitant Medications: A current list of prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements, and 
treatments for CLE and SLE will be obtained. Assessment of eligibility should include a review of permitted and 
prohibited medications. The medication, dose, frequency, route, start date, stop date, and indication will be 
captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Medications taken 30 days prior to screening through study 
completion or termination should be reported. 
 Eligibility Review:  All entry criteria should be reviewed, and eligibility confirmed prior to scheduling Visit 1 (Day 
0) and again at Visit 1 (Day 0) before drawing blood or phototesting (UVB exposure). 
8.5.3.  Clinical Assessments 
 EULAR/ACR Lupus 2019 [23]: Screening only. 
 CLASI [24]:  This is a validated instrument for evaluating skin inflammation and damage.  
 SLEDAI-2K:  This is a validated instrument for evaluating SLE disease activity. Each component has a weighted 
point value which can sum up to 105. Conditions that are ongoing, recurrent, or new should be assessed 
consistently in relation to a participant’s lupus disease activity. A score ≥ 6 is indicative of active disease.  
 Physical Examination:   A comprehensive physical examination will be performed at each clinic visit where the 
CLASI and/or SLEDAI 2K are indicated. See Table 8.2, Schedule of Events , for more detail.  
 Height, Weight, and Vital signs:   Height and weight will only be collected at Screening. Vital signs will include 
pulse, blood pressure, and temperature (Co). Vital signs should be obtained with the participant in a seated 
position prior to taking samples for laboratory testing at applicable study visits. 
 Fitzpatrick Scale Assessment[25] 
 Adverse Event Monitoring 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 32 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 8.5.4.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine for the clinical laboratory assessments listed below will be collected per Table 8.2, Schedule of 
Events . The results will be evaluated for safety by [CONTACT_6962]. Abnormal tests that meet grading and 
reporting criteria will be reported as adverse events (See Section 12.3.1, Grading Criteria ). 
 Hematology : complete blood count (CBC) including hemoglobin, hematocrit, white cell count, absolute 
neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, and platelet count; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 
 Blood Chemistry: including lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (triglycerides and cholesterol), ALT, AST, bilirubin, creatinine, eGFR, C3, C4. 
 Urinalysis : including protein: creatinine ratio, RBCs, and WBCs.  
 Serum immunoglobulins : including anti-ds DNA. 
 Infectious Disease Testing  (Screening only): including HIV antigen/antibody or NAT, IGRA or [COMPANY_003], hepatitis B 
surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody with HCV RNA (PCR) if antibody 
positive  
 Pregnancy Testing : serum pregnancy test (Screening), urine pregnancy test (Visit 4 (Day 25) or Early Termination 
Visit).  
8.5.5.  Research Assessments  
 Blood for Serum Biomarkers  will be drawn at Visit 1 (Day 0) and Visit 4 (Day 25). 
 Blood for Cellular and Proteomic studies  will be drawn at Visit 1 (Day 0) and Visit 4 (Day 25). 
 UVB Exposure :  
 A UV Lamp (Ultralite Enterprises Model 36P10A 10-UNV or equivalent device) will be identified by [CONTACT_622997], and manufacturer at each site.  The same device will be used for all phototesting at each 
site. The UVB dose, based upon the distance from the UV lamp to the participant, will be determined using 
dedicated photometer and probe prior to each use. 
Phototesting will occur at the study site. A photo-barrier template will be placed on non-lesional skin of the 
participant’s exposed lower back/buttock. The template will be placed on the right lower back/buttock for the 
phototest on Visit 1 (Day 0) and on the left lower back/buttock for the Visit 4 (Day 25) test. UV irradiation will be 
applied to the template area via a UV Lamp (Ultralite Enterprises Model 36P10A 10-UNV or equivalent device), 
and every [ADDRESS_829607] 
been covered (i.e., total exposure ranges from 10-80 mJ/cm2).  
 Before initiating phototesting at Visit 4 (Day 25), the participant should meet all the following criteria: 
 The participant must have completed at least 21 days of IP dosing. 
o For individuals whose Visit 4 (Day 25) has been delayed (See Section 8.1.1, Exception to Visit 
Windows ), the 21 days starts from the day IP dosing is resumed. 
 The participant must confirm that no IP doses have been missed in the prior 7 days. Dosing will be tracked 
on a paper patient diary and in the EDC (Electronic Data Capture) system. 
 The participant must have taken at least 84% of expected daily doses from the day of the first IP dose. 
Compliance is based on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_622971] 4 (Day 25).   
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 33 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 o For individuals whose Visit 4 (Day 25) has been delayed (See Section 8.1.1, Exception to Visit 
Window Rules), compliance should be computed from the day IP dosing is resumed. 
If a participant fails to bring the IP pi[INVESTIGATOR_73586](s) back at Visit 4 (Day 25), UVB exposure may proceed during this 
visit. However, site personnel must confirm at least 84% compliance via a visual pi[INVESTIGATOR_622972] 5 (Day 26). If 84% compliance is not achieved, participant may resume IP dosing. 
Once the participant has completed appropriate IP dosing, the UVB exposure will be conducted on a site on the 
lower back, above the original. If the participant does not take the final dose of IP the morning of Visit 5 (Day 26), 
the erythema assessment and biopsy will still take place, as long as the participant is compliant with their IP dose 
the 7 days prior to Day 26. 
 Erythema Assessment :   
At Visit 2 (Day 1) and Visit 5 (Day 26), erythema levels for unexposed skin and each template square of the UVB-
exposed skin will be quantified using a Chroma Meter (Minolta Model CR-400 or equivalent device). To 
determine the MED, first compute the average of all the unexposed skin’s a* (redness) readings and add 2.5.  
The lowest exposure with the site’s average a* (redness) readings at or above this value is the MED.  All skin 
types (except for Fitzpatrick VI) can be expected to show a response within the planned exposure range[26]. 
 Skin Biopsy :  At the indicated time points, 6mm-diameter punch biopsies of nonlesional skin are planned at 3 
sites as follows: 
1. On Visit 2 (Day 1), 3 biopsy sites on the right buttock include (1) unexposed skin, (2) skin exposed to the 
1x MED, and (3) skin exposed to the UVB dose that is 1 step higher than the 1x MED.  
2. On Visit 5 (Day 26), 3 biopsy sites on the left buttock will be comparable to those taken on Visit 2 (Day 
1), including (1) unexposed skin, (2) skin exposed to the same UVB Dose as the 1x MED from the Visit 2 
(Day 1) assessment, and (3) skin exposed to the UVB dose that is 1 step higher than the 1x MED from the 
Visit 2 (Day 1) assessment.  If the 1x MED from the Visit 2 (Day 1) assessment is at the highest UVB dose 
(80mJ/cm2) or if no erythema is detectable on exposed skin at any dose, then two 4mm biopsies of skin 
exposed the highest UVB dose will be taken at both Visit 2 (Day 1) and Visit 5 (Day 26).  
3. Stitch removal is planned for Visit 3 (Day 14) and Visit 6 (Day 40).  
 
 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 36 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 9. Mechanistic Assays 
Studies on skin biopsies  
1. RNA sequencing to identify changes in inflammatory gene expression before and after UV exposure before and 
after tofacitinib.  
2. TUNEL, 8-hydroxyguanosine, and caspase-3 staining to evaluate for cell death before and after UV exposure 
before and after tofacitinib. 
3. Spatial sequencing to evaluate the inflammatory cell populations before and after UV exposure before and after 
tofacitinib. 
4. Vgll3 localization in biopsies before and after UV exposure before and after tofacitinib to understand how this 
regulator of female bias in autoimmunity is modulated in lupus. 
Studies on blood  
1. Activation of neutrophil NETosis before and after tofacitinib. 
10. Biospecimen Storage 
1. Formalin Fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin biopsies collected as part of this study will be retained for up to 
15 years. 
2. Plasma from treated participants will be stored for contribution to approved other collaborative projects. 
3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from studies left over from neutrophil isolation will be frozen and 
stored in LN [ADDRESS_829608] complete Visits 1 (Day 0), 2 (Day 1), 4 (Day 25), and 5 (Day 26) for inclusion in the final analysis of 
photosensitivity endpoints.  
11.2. Participant Withdrawal Criteria 
Participants may be prematurely withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
1. The participant elects to withdraw consent from all future study activities, including follow-up. 
2. The participant is “lost to follow-up” under the following conditions: 
 An eligible participant who could not be contact[CONTACT_322252] 1 (Day 0) within the screening 
period. Alternatively, this participant may be re-screened. 
 A participant who attended Visit 2 (Day 1) but, at some point during follow-up, attempts to reestablish 
contact [CONTACT_622998]. Attempts to reconnect should continue until Day 25 at which point “lost 
to follow-up” may be declared.  
 A participant who attended Visit 1 (Day 0), but misses Visit 2 (Day 1) is allowed to re-screen if contact 
[CONTACT_622999]. Otherwise, “lost to follow-up” may be declared. 
3. The participant dies.  
4. The investigator no longer believes participation is in the best interest of the participant.  
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 37 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 If a participant withdraws from the study, the participant will be asked to return for a final visit where the 
assessments outlined in the early termination visit in Table 8.2, Schedule of Events , will be performed. No additional 
follow-up will be requested from participants after early study withdrawal. 
11.3. Participant Replacement 
Participants who fail to complete the Visit 4 (Day 25) and Visit 5 (Day 26) photosensitivity and biopsy assessments may 
be replaced according to the following rules, which depend on the reason for withdrawal from the study:  
 No more than three individuals withdrawn for reasons due to concerns over safety or tolerability of tofacitinib 
may be replaced.  
 No more than 18 individuals withdrawn for reasons other than safety or tolerability concerns, including 
“external” reasons unrelated to the individual (e.g., study site closed due to COVID-19), may be replaced. 
11.4. Follow-up after Early Study Withdrawal 
Participants who withdraw from the study for any reason will be asked to consent to a final Early Termination Visit to 
complete clinical and safety assessments. See Protocol Section 8.4 Early Termination Visits  for more information. 
11.5. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_622973]-specified study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. 
If any of the events described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], Ad hoc DSMB Reviews  occur, an ad hoc DSMB review will occur. After 
review of the data, the Data Safety Motoring Board (DSMB) will make recommendations regarding the study conduct 
and/or continuation.  
12. Safety Monitoring and Reporting 
12.1. Overview 
This section defines the types of safety data that will be collected under this protocol and outlines the procedures for 
appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting those data. Adverse events that are classified as serious 
according to the definition of health authorities must be reported promptly (per Section 12.5, Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events and Adverse Events ) to the sponsor, DAIT/NIAID.  Appropriate notifications will also be made to site 
principal investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).  
Information in this section complies with International Council for Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety 
Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, ICH Guideline E-6: Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice, the principles of 21CFR Parts 312 and 320, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 : Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events PDF.  
12.2. Definitions 
12.2.1. Adverse Event (AE) 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether 
or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of adverse events 
in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E-6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice) (from OHRP 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 38 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 "Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse 
Events (1/15/07)" http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2 )  
12.2.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational drug [or investigational study 
therapy regimen] caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
(SAR) implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event 
caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)). 
For this study, a SAR will include any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with:   
 Study therapy: tofacitinib 
 Skin biopsy 
 UVB exposure 
12.2.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the package insert or is 
not listed at the specificity, severity or rate of occurrence that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the Investigational New Drug (IND). 
12.2.4. Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event or SAR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID, it results in any 
of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
1. Death. 
2. A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
DAIT/NIAID, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622974].  
12.3. Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events 
12.3.1. Grading Criteria 
The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_623000]’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 . This 
document (referred to herein as the NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 39 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events. The NCI-CTCAE has been 
reviewed by [CONTACT_623001]. 
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual: 
Grade 1 = mild adverse event. 
Grade 2 = moderate adverse event. 
Grade 3 = severe or medically significant. 
Grade 4 = life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5 = death. 
Events of Grade 2 or higher and all Grade 1 or higher COVID-19 events will be recorded on the appropriate AE eCRF for 
this study according to 12.4, Collection and Recording of Adverse Events . 
For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited to, a 
radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), a treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an increase 
in grade from the last assessment prior to a participant starting treatment, or from the last post-baseline value that 
doesn’t meet grading criteria. Changes in grade from screening to Day 0, Day 1, and treatment initiation (Day 2) will 
also be recorded as adverse events, but are not treatment-emergent. If a specific event or result from a given clinical 
or laboratory evaluation is not included in the NCI-CTCAE manual, then an abnormal result would be considered an 
adverse event if changes in therapy or monitoring are implemented as a result of the event/result.  
Liver function abnormalities will be graded using criteria from NCI-CTCAE version 4.0, defined relative to the ULN as 
follows: 
 Aspartate aminotransferase [AST] increased 
o Grade 1: > ULN – 3.0x ULN 
o Grade 2: > 3.0x ULN - 5.0x ULN 
o Grade 3: > 5.0x ULN - 20.0x ULN  
o Grade 4: > 20.0x ULN 
 Alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increased 
o Grade 1: > ULN – 3.0x ULN 
o Grade 2: > 3.0x ULN - 5.0x ULN 
o Grade 3: > 5.0x ULN - 20.0x ULN  
o Grade 4: > 20.0x ULN 
 Alkaline phosphatase [ALP] increased 
o Grade 1: > ULN – 2.5x ULN 
o Grade 2: > 2.5x ULN - 5.0x ULN 
o Grade 3: > 5.0x ULN - 20.0x ULN  
o Grade 4: > 20.0x ULN 
 Blood bilirubin increased  
o Grade 1: > ULN – 1.5x ULN 
o Grade 2: > 1.5x ULN - 3.0x ULN 
o Grade 3: > 3.0x ULN - 10.0x ULN  
o Grade 4: > 10.0x ULN

ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 12.3.2. Attribution Definitions 
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or study procedure(s) will initially be 
determined by [CONTACT_623002]/SAE eCRF .  Final determination of attribution

12.4. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events 
12.4.1. Collection Period 
Adverse events will be collected and recorded in EDC from Visit 1 (Day 0), until a participant completes study 
participation or until 30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws or is withdrawn from the study (without 
withdrawing consent). Serious Adverse Events, as defined in Section 12.2.4 Serious Adverse Events , Suspected Adverse 
Reactions, as defined in Section 12.2.2, Suspected Adverse Reactions,  and adverse events related to study procedures 
will be collected and recorded in EDC from the time of consent until a participant completes study participation or 
until 30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws or is withdrawn from the study (without withdrawing consent). 
12.4.2. Collecting Adverse Events 
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods: 
 Observing the participant. 
 Interviewing the participant [e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc.]. 
 Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant. 
In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an adverse event, as 
defined in Section 12.3, Grading and Attribution of  Adverse Events. 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page [ADDRESS_829609] all adverse events and SAEs as described previously (Section 12.2, 
Definitions) on the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF regardless of the relationship to study therapy regimen or study 
procedure. 
Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the end of study 
participation, or until [ADDRESS_829610] (without withdrawing consent). 
12.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events 
12.5.1. Reporting of Adverse Events  
This section describes the responsibilities of the site investigator to report AEs to the study sponsor via the DAIT-
SACCC (Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center).  
Timely reporting of AEs of NCI-CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_829611] be recorded on the AE/SAE eCRF within five (5) days of 
discovery of the event. Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be provided, rather than compi[INVESTIGATOR_622975]/symptoms, with grade of the event dictated by [CONTACT_93253]/symptom component. 
12.5.2. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to DAIT/NIAID (Sponsor) 
This section describes the responsibilities of the site investigator to report SAEs to the Study Sponsor (NIAID/DAIT) via 
the AE/SAE eCRF.  Timely reporting of adverse events is required by [ADDRESS_829612] notify DAIT/NIAID via the DAIT-SACCC within 24 hours 
regardless of the relationship or expectedness. Site investigators are to report these events on the SAE eCRF in 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC). Should EDC become unavailable/ inaccessible, the site investigator should notify 
DAIT/NIAID via the DAIT-SACCC email at [EMAIL_11854].  This email can serve as the initial 
notification; however, within the next business day the SAE eCRF must be completed. 
All requested information on the SAE eCRF should be provided. Unavailable details of the event at time of initial report 
should not delay submission of known information. The initial report should include at a minimum: AE term, 
relationship to tofacitinib, and reason why event is serious (per definitions). Supplementary Case Report Form (CRF) 
pages including medical history, concomitant medications, demographics, study drug administration, and death must 
be provided. As additional details become available, the SAE eCRF should be updated and submitted. With each 
iteration of the form, the investigator (or designated sub-investigator) must sign the form electronically.

ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 13. Statistical Considerations and Analytical Plan 
13.1. Overview 
This is a single-arm multi-site proof-of-concept study in which participants with CLE will undergo 25 days of treatment 
with tofacitinib (11 mg daily PO).  The primary objective is to determine the impact of tofacitinib on photosensitivity 
parameters, including UVB-mediated cutaneous apoptosis, UVB-mediated inflammatory gene transcription, and MED in 
response to UVB exposure. The study will also evaluate changes in clinical endpoints and safety.  
13.2. Endpoints 
Primary and secondary endpoints are listed in Sections 3.2, Primary Endpoint  and 3.3, Secondary Endpoints .    
13.3. Measures to Minimize Bias 
This study includes well-defined entry criteria to ensure the target population is correctly identified. Although the study 
has a single open-label arm, the photosensitivity parameters, which are key to evaluating the primary objective, are all 
objectively measured and not subject to participant or investigator bias.  To minimize the potential threat to study 
integrity by [CONTACT_623006]/biopsies, assessments are kept to minimum, 
and attention will be paid to participant well-being during and after procedures. 
13.4. Analysis Plan 
13.4.1. Analysis Populations 
The Safety Sample (SS)  population includes all participants who receive any amount of tofacitinib.  
The Per Protocol 1 (PP1)  population includes all participants who receive any amount of tofacitinib and who 
complete phototests and skin biopsies at both baseline (Visits 1 and 2) and post-treatment (Visits 4 and 5) time 
points. Only individuals who complete at least [ADDRESS_829616]-treatment time points. 
The Per Protocol 2 (PP2)  population includes all PP1 participants with no protocol deviations that would impact 
photo sensitivity assessments. The reported major deviations will be reviewed during a masked data review to 
determine which participants should be excluded from the PP2 population. 
13.4.2. Primary Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is change in percentage of UVB-induced apoptotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_622958] 2 (Day 1) (pre-
treatment) to Visit 5 (Day 26) (post-treatment). Percentage of UVB-induced apoptotic cells (AUVB) is defined as the 
number of TUNEL positive cells in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_622976]. The 
percentage of UVB-induced apoptotic cells at a visit is defined as the difference between the percentage of apoptotic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_622977] (ADay1MED) and percentage of apoptotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_622978] (Aunexposed), for both biopsies taken at the same visit.  The change in percentage of UVB-induced 
apoptotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_622979]: 
Aୈୟ୷ ଵ୙୚୆= Aୈୟ୷ ଵୈୟ୷ଵ୑୉ୈ− Aୈୟ୷ ଵୈୟ୷ ଵ ୳୬ୣ୶୮୭ୱୣୢ

Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 45 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 The null and alternative hypotheses for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint are: 
H0:  Mean change in A୙୚୆= 0  
HA: Mean change in A୙୚୆≠ [ADDRESS_829617]-treatment time 
points. All secondary inferential analyses are considered supportive; p-values will be presented without adjustment 
for multiple comparisons.  
Analysis of secondary safety endpoints will be conducted using the safety population.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Photosensitivity parameters 
The following analyses of these secondary endpoints will support the primary objective to evaluate the 
impact of tofacitinib on photosensitivity parameters. 
 Change in MED due to UVB from Visit 2 (Day 1) to Visit 5 (Day 26) : MED is an ordinal endpoint. Shifts 
in MED levels from pre- to post-treatment will be evaluated using the McNemar-Bowker test for 
symmetry.  
 Change in UVB-induced expression of inflammatory genes in skin from Visit 2 (Day 1) to Visit 5 (Day 
26), based on enumeration of RNA transcripts :  The mean change will be evaluated using a two-sided 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Disease activity 
 Changes in CLASI activity score, CLASI damage scores, and SLEDAI-2K total scores from Visit 1 (Day 0) 
to Visit 4 (Day 25) : For each endpoint, the mean change will be evaluated using a two-sided Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety  
 Clinical laboratory values will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  In addition, individuals with a 
laboratory value that increases during the study by 1 or more severity grades per NCI-CTCAE will be 
identified and tabulated. 
 Treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_926], by [CONTACT_8792], and 
by [CONTACT_623007].   
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 47 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 power is ≥93% for a mean change in AUVB of at least 20 percentage points under all four distributions ( =0.05, two-sided, 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Power is ≥80% under all [ADDRESS_829618] 21.4 percentage 
points as long as the SD≤ 20%.  If the underlying SD is 30%, the upper 80% confidence limit from Table 13.1, the design 
has at least 80% power to detect a change of at least 30 percentage points under the uniform, logistic, and double 
exponential distributions, and 32.1 percentage points under the normal distribution. Power was computed using PASS 
version 15. 
 
Figure 2. Power for 10 paired samples (pre and post treatment) under different distribution assumptions  
All participants completing Visit 5 (Day 26) skin biopsy will be included in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
For the primary analysis, there will be no missing data; participants who cannot complete the second biopsy will be 
replaced. As such, missing data does not impact the power/sample size considerations, but attrition will be considered 
when evaluating generalizability of the results. 
14. Identification and Access to Source Data 
14.1. Source Data 
Source documents and source data are considered to be the original documentation where participant information, 
visits consultations, examinations and other information are recorded.   Documentation of source data is necessary for 
the reconstruction, evaluation, and validation of clinical findings, observations, and other activities during a clinical trial.  

Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 48 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 14.2. Access to Source Data 
The site investigators and site staff will make all source data available to the DAIT/NIAID, NIAID representatives, agents, 
employees, contractors, and other persons assisting in conducting, monitoring, or analyzing the study,  as well as to 
relevant health authorities. Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality 
of medical and research information that may be linked to identified individuals. 
15. Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622980]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622981]. The period of record retention should be consistent with the record retention policies of the sponsoring 
agency or applicable regulatory agencies. However, in certain instances, documents should be retained for a longer 
period if required by [CONTACT_623008].  
Data will be obtained from a variety of sources including, but not limited to laboratory notebooks, automated 
instrument output files, and clinical participant charts. Data from these source materials will be transmitted to the DAIT 
data center via one of two mechanisms. Data collected electronically at central laboratories will be transferred 
electronically directly from the laboratory to the DAIT data center using standard secure data transfer procedures. Data 
collected at the clinical site will be transmitted to the DAIT data center using an internet-based remote data entry 
system. Clinical site personnel use an internet browser to key data into eCRFs; each CRF page is submitted to the clinical 
database electronically as the page is completed. Univariate data validation tests are performed as the data are keyed. 
The clinical database is backed up nightly; backup tapes are saved in a secure, off-site location. At any time, authorized 
site personnel may log in to the remote data entry system, review and correct previously entered data, or key additional 
data. The data will be further validated per the study data validation plan via a series of computerized and manual edit 
checks, and all relevant data queries will be raised and resolved on an ongoing basis. Complete, clean data will be frozen 
to prevent further inadvertent modifications. All discrepancies will be reviewed, and any resulting queries will be 
resolved with the investigators and amended in the database. All elements of data entry (i.e., time, date, verbatim text, 
and the person performing the data entry) will be recorded in an electronic audit trail to allow all data changes in the 
database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations.   
Monitors are responsible for regular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and 
for confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data.  
Monitors will periodically visit the participating clinical site and audit the source documents in order to validate the data 
in the central database. Data will be provided using the participant’s screening or enrollment number, the DAIT data 
center will not collect personally identifying information such as the participant’s name [CONTACT_78207]. 
Participants will provide demographic information such as race, ethnicity, and birth date. 
Data collected by [CONTACT_623009].

ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 16. Protocol Deviations 
16.1. Protocol Deviation Definitions 
Protocol Deviation  – The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance with the protocol; no 
deviations from the protocol are permitted.  Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures 
constitutes a protocol deviation.  As a result of any deviation, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_90478]. 
Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation) – A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that 
may affect the participant's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of the study 
data.  In addition, protocol violations include willful or knowing breaches of human subject protection regulations, or 
policies, any action that is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research Protection Program’s research, medical, and 
ethical principles, and a serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or institutional human subject 
protection regulations, policies, or procedures.  
Non-Major Protocol Deviation  – A non-major protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study 
design or procedures of a research protocol that does not have a major impact on the participant's rights, safety or well-
being, or the completeness, accuracy, and reliability of the study data. 
16.2. Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations 
The study site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393241], document and report protocol deviations as 
directed by [CONTACT_80964]/NIAID.  However, protocol deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during 
other forms of study conduct review.  
When a deviation occurs, corrective actions may be necessary depending on the nature of the deviation. The Principal 
Investigator (PI) and NIAID/DAIT conduct a risk assessment. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_622982], outside monitors or auditors, or other parties involved in the 
conduct of a study. The depth of Corrective Action/Preventive Action (CAPA) required should match the risk and impact 
on safety of participants and/or the quality of the data. 
Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the PI/designated study staff will report the deviation 
according to the processes outlined for the study. A major deviation is to be reported within 3 business days and 
reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_622983]. NIAID/DAIT will determine if the deviation is reportable to 
the DSMB, as applicable.  
17. Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
17.1. Statement of Compliance 
This clinical study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in Guidance for Industry: E6 Good 
Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance , and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol.  Before study 
initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201] .  Any 
amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will also be approved by [CONTACT_623010]. 
Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence Confidential Page 50 of 52  
ALE11 Version 7.0 October 25, 2023 17.2. Informed Consent Process 
The consent process will provide information about the study to a prospective participant and will allow adequate time 
for review and discussion prior to his/her decision.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622984].  The prospective participant will be told that being 
in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  All participants (or 
their legally acceptable representative) will read, sign, and date a consent form before undergoing any study 
procedures.  Consent materials will be presented in participants’ primary language. A copy of the signed consent form 
will be given to the participant. 
The consent process will be ongoing.   The consent form will be revised when important new safety information is 
available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes available that may affect participation in the 
study.  
17.3. Privacy and Confidentiality 
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each participant will be assigned a 
unique identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store, and report participant 
information.  The code linking the participant’s identity to the unique identification number will be securely stored a 
password protected, HIPPA compliant shared drive managed by [CONTACT_623011].  
The only the protocol chair and approved study team members who have completed appropriate human subjects 
research training have access to the drive. Site personnel will not transmit documents containing personal health 
identifiers (PHI) to the NIAID/DAIT or their representatives. 
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence.  No 
information concerning the study, or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written 
approval of NIAID/DAIT. 
The study Monitor or other authorized representatives of the NIAID/DAIT may inspect all documents and records 
required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
and pharmacy records for the participants in this study.  The clinical study site will permit access to such records. 
18. Publication Policy 
The Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence’s policy on the publication of study results will apply to this trial. Authorized 
participants may find details regarding the policy statement on the ADCT internet website at http://www.rhoworld.com .

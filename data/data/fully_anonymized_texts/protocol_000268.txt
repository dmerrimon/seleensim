5 1. Background and rationa le for the study  
Glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a critical housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_117811] [1, 2].  The most common human enzyme defect is G6PD deficiency, which affects more than 400 million 
people worldwide  [3]. This deficiency can be severe, characterized by [CONTACT_117826] G6PD activity or 
intermediate, characterized by [CONTACT_117827] G 6PD activity. Red blood cells are especially vulnerable to 
the effects of these mutations because they cannot replenish their supplies of the enzyme once they mature and 
enter the bloodstream. As a result, these cells are susceptible to hemolysis when subjected to oxida tive stress, which 
can occur after therapy with the anti -malarial 8 -aminoquinolines such as primaquine, a few antibiotics, and some anti -
inflammatories. Hemolysis can also be activated by [CONTACT_117828], including foods (e.g., fava beans), 
henna, a nd some infections (e.g., hepatitis A or B, pneumonia, and typhoid fever). In newborns, G6PD deficiency is 
often first manifested as jaundice resulting from hyperbilirubinemia, which, if unchecked, can lead to kernicterus, a 
form of brain damage.  
In 1989,  the World Health Organization (WHO) working group on G6PD deficiency recommended that when possible, 
newborns should be screened for G6PD deficiency where G6PD deficiency is common [4]. However, this screening is 
not routinely done in the [LOCATION_002]  [5]. Screening for G6PD  deficiency is included in the newborn screening 
programs of only two states  and some facilities outside of those states may choose  to adopt universal or targeted 
screening for G6PD independent of routine newborn screening programs  [6,7]. While knowing the G6PD status of a 
patient is useful clinical information, access to testing for G6PD deficiency is very limited due to the price and 
complexity of the diagnostic products available for this condition, especially in and low -resource set tings.  
G6PD status is particularly relevant for the treatment and prevention of malaria. M alaria is prevented and treated 
using a variety of treatments, some of which pose a high risk to those with G6PD deficiency. The 8-aminoquinoline –
based drugs for malaria treatment and prophylaxis , such as primaquine and  tafenoquine , are the only ones with the 
capacity to prevent relapse and eliminate the liver stage parasites in Plasmodium  vivax  infections. Because of the 
risks associated to G6PD deficiency for primaq uine exposure , WHO recommends that “the G6PD status of patients 
should be used to guide administration of primaquine for preventing relapse”  [8]. 
Currently, the G6PD status of a patient is most often defined by [CONTACT_102] ’s G6PD phenotype, characterized b y 
analysis of t otal activity in blood lysate [3 ]. This method, considered the reference  standard, is a costly and complex 
quantitative laboratory -based spectrophotometric test. The quantitative laboratory test can clearly identify subjects 
with all ranges of G6PD activities (including those with intermediate levels who may also be at risk of severe 
hemolysis ), but these methods require an equipped la boratory and skilled personnel [ 9,10]. In field settings, the most 
commonly performed tests are qualitative devices such as the fluorescent spot test (FST) or the AccessBio, Inc. 
CareStart ™ test [ 11,12 ] which can only discriminate gross deficiencies from all the other phenotypes. These are 
adeq uate for males who are either deficient or normal in G6PD status. Females, however, who carry two alleles of 
the G6PD gene, can present as deficient, intermediate, or normal for G6PD activity. Qualitative tests cannot 
discriminate an intermediate from a no rmal G6PD status. Quantitative tests are required to provide better case 
management for  women, especially in anticipation of the availability of tafenoquine , which is indicated only for women 
and men with normal G6PD activity.  
Given variety of clinical se ttings where G6PD status can be used to inform clinical care , point -of-care (POC) G6PD 
tests are required to support broader availability of primaquine and , in the future, tafenoquine. For treatment of 
women whose enzymatic activity is estimated to be norm al by [CONTACT_117829]-dose primaquine or tafenoquine, a quantitative portable device will be needed to obtain more accurate levels of 
G6PD activity to ensure appropriate and safe treatment  [13].   
PATH and the product developers have assessed the candidate POC test performance through laboratory 
evaluations using frozen specimens. Next steps in the validation of the POC test include an assessment of diagnostic 
accuracy using clinical samples in representative use cases.   
6 2. Study objectives  
The goal of this study is to contribute to a body of evidence that will support the submission of G6PD tests to the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), WHO  prequalification  (PQ) process , and  for product registrat ion in target 
countries.  
The primary objective is to assess the accuracy of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Analyze r in measuring  
G6PD activity when used by [CONTACT_117830].  This study aims to e stablish performance characteristics for 
SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Analyze r when performed from venous and capi[INVESTIGATOR_117812].  Results from 
the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Analyze r will be compared to results from an FDA -cleared quantitative G6PD 
assay and FDA -cleared hemoglobin assay :  Pointe  Scientific test kit.   
3. Study design  
This is a prospective cross -sectional diagnostic accuracy study . Study endpoints include:  
• Sensitivity and specificity of SD Biosensor POC G6PD test compared to the Pointe Scientific test kit for 
identifying G6PD deficien t individuals and women with intermediate G6PD activity  
• Accuracy between the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test measure of G6PD activity and the Pointe Scientific test kit   
• Accuracy between the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test measure of hemoglobin (Hb) and Hemo Cue 201+ , a point 
of care reference haemoglobin assay   
• Comparison of the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test result s for capi[INVESTIGATOR_117810] . 
3.1 Sample size  
The sample size for this study is based on the expected prevalence of G6PD deficiency and on data requirements set 
by [CONTACT_117831] [1 5]. This requires obtaining samples from 
participants with a range  of G6PD activity levels. The WHO PQ process defines these levels as shown in Table 1. 
Table 1. G6PD activity thresholds . 
Sex Level  Threshold  Estimated quantitative thresholds   
Female  Deficient  G6PD activity <30% of the adjusted male 
median  <4 IU/ g Hb  
Female  Intermediate  G6PD activity 30% to 80% of the adjusted male 
median  4-6 IU/ g Hb  
Female  Normal  G6PD activity >80% of the adjusted male 
median  >6 IU/ g Hb  
Male  Deficient  G6PD activity <30% of the adjusted male 
median  <4 IU/ g Hb  
Male  Normal  G6PD activity >30% of the adjusted male 
median  >6 IU/ g Hb  
Abbreviation: G6PD, glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase . 
According to the target product profile, the novel POC G6PD will need to be at least 95% sensitive for detecting 
G6PD activity levels at 30% to 80% of normal enzyme activity  [13]. Sample size calculations for this study are 
determined by a standard method, sometimes referred to as Buderer’s equation, where study sample size 
requirements are calculated based on a clinicall y acceptable degree of precision, the hypothesized values of 
sensitivity and specificity, and the estimated prevalence of disease in the target population [14]. Assuming a 
sensitivity of 95%, with a confidence interval of 95%, and a 1% to 2% maximum margin al error, a minimum of 162 
participants with deficient and intermediate G6PD activity will be needed for the analysis . To account for any possible 
device/diagnostic failures or compromised blood samples due to insufficient blood, signs of blood degradation , or 
contamination, the sample size is increased by 20 % to approximately 200 participants with deficient activity and 200 
participants with intermediate G6PD activity.  
7 In this US, t he estimated prevalence of G6PD activity at less than 30% of normal enzyme  activity can be up to 12 % in 
certain subpopulations [16,17]. By [CONTACT_6310] a minimum of 2 50 individuals , this study aims to include 20  deficient and 20 
intermediate individuals.  
In order to achieve the target number of deficient and intermediate samples (20 0), these data will be combined with 
data generated  in other clinical evaluation in the US, Ethiopia and Brazil  for regulatory submissions to the US FDA 
and/or WHO . The additional evaluations will include approximately 3,000 total participants with  over 200 expected 
deficient and intermediate individuals.   
3.2 Study sites  
The Seattle Malaria Clinical Trials Center (MCTC) is an inter -institutional collaboration based primarily at the Fred 
Hutch Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington.  For this study, clinic visits will be conducted at the

9 5.1 Diagnostic performance assessment  
5.1.1 Blood collection and testing procedures at the point of care  
Following completion of the informed consent process, the study staff, who are trained in phlebotomy,  will draw the 
following blood volumes:  
- two 2-mL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -anticoagulated blood  
- one 4 -mL tube of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -anticoagulated blood  
- a finge r stick sample of no more than [ADDRESS_131420] result is obtained from a second finger stick , the results will be 
recorded as invalid. If the participant is found to be anemic  based only on the Hemo Cue assay , the participant will be 
referred to a health care provider  for follow -up and case management.  
Once POC tests are completed  on venous blood , the remaining blood in the 4 -mL EDTA tube will be stored and 
transported  as follows:  
• Prevention center  will transfer samples to PATH laboratories approximatly twice per week.  Leftover samples will 
be aliquoted and stored at PATH laboratory for possible confirmatory or additional testing. Depending on 
availability of additional novel malaria tests, addition al assays may be run on remaining samples. Samples will be 
aliquot ed 6 x 0.5 ml of whole blood in cryogenic tubes  and s tored at –80°C in the freezer. Maximum storage time 
is [ADDRESS_131421] (FST) . Appropriate permission for additional testing relating to malaria will be obtained through the 
consent process.  
• The two [ADDRESS_131422] profile  [13] (greater than 2 IU/ gram) , testing with the reference test will be repeated using stored venous 
samples when possible. If there is discordance between the index test and the reference test, testing will be repeated 
using stored venous samples where possible to assess whether the discordance is reproducible. Performance 
characteristics and the results of additional testing of samples with discrepant results w ill be re ported as per WHO 
guidelines [ 15].  
5.[ADDRESS_131423] obtain 90% or better to be deemed proficient.  
5.5 Quality Control (QC) Testing  
QC results must be within specifications for any test method result to be reported.  QC testing on the Pointe Scientific 
G6PD assay, the HemoCue Hb assay, and the SD Biosensor will be performed each day of testing.   
6. Consent process  
The i nformed consent  process  encompasses all written or verbal study information the Seattle MCTC study staff 
provides to the subject, before and during the trial. All informed consent discussions will be documented by [CONTACT_117833]’s source documentation. Conse nt discussions include, but are not limited to, background on G6PD 
and rationale for this study, an overview of the study design, study procedures, requirements for participation in the 
trial, and risks and benefits to the subject.  
Written informed consent  will be obtained only by [CONTACT_117834], using the protocol -specific Informed Consent Form approved by [CONTACT_117835], local IRB/IEC requirements, federal 
guidelines [ADDRESS_131424] G6PD Analyzer (investigational product)  
The STANDARD G6PD Analyzer (Figure 2 on the following page) is designed to measure the quantitative 
determination of total  Hb concentration and G6PD enzymatic activity in fresh human whole blood specimens based 
on reflectometry assays. The test is intended to aid in the identification of peo ple with G6PD deficiency. The test is 
[ADDRESS_131425].  System components sha ll be 
labeled in accordance with regulatory requirements, including the following statement, “For Investigatio nal Use Only. 
The performance characteristics of this product have not been established.”

7.[ADDRESS_131426] kit  (Reference Assay)  
The Pointe Scientific test kit will serve as the reference assay to assess G6PD activity. Its intended use is for the 
quantitative, kinetic d etermination of G6PD in blood at 340 nm. It is designed for in vitro diagnostic use on ly. 
• A spectrophotom eter capable of me asuring at 340 nm with a temp erature-controlled cuvette compartment is 
required to perfo rm the  assay. 
• To determine G6PD activity, which is reported in terms of grams of Hb or the number of r ed blood cells, the Hb or 
red blood cell  count must be determined separately from p erforming the G6PD assay. Calculations are then 
performed to obtain the G6PD activity, normalized for the Hb level . For purposes of this st udy, the G6PD activity 
from the Pointe S cientific kit will be  calculated in te rms of grams of Hb  as determined by [CONTACT_117836] .

7.3 HemoCue system  
The HemoCue Hb 201+ system is designed for quantitative POC whole blood Hb determination in primary  care using 
a specially designed analyzer, the HemoCue Hb 201+Analyzer, and specially designed microcuvettes, the HemoCue 
Hb 201+Microcuvettes. The HemoCue Hb 201+system is for in vitro diagnostic use only. It consists of a small 
portable analyzer (photometer) and plastic microcuvettes. The microcuvette serves both a s a pi[INVESTIGATOR_117814] a 
measuring cuvette. A blood sample is drawn into the cavity by [CONTACT_117837][INVESTIGATOR_117815]. The filled microcuvette is inserted 
into the HemoCue Hb 201+Analyzer. The measurement takes place in the analyzer, which measures the absorbance 
of who le blood at an Hb/HbO [ADDRESS_131427] (FST) or TrinityBiotech G -6-PDH Screening test is widely used for in vitro diagnosis of 
G6PD deficiency using whole blood or dried blood spots. The G -6-PDH Screening test is a qualitative test performed 
by [CONTACT_117838] a small amount of blood with glucose -6-phosphate and nicotinamide a denine dinucleotide phosphate 
(NADP). Drops of the mixture are removed at [ADDRESS_131428] will be

8. Data and data management  
8.1 Statistical analyses  
Data will be entered into a database with built -in validation rules to minimize data entry errors. Descriptive statistical 
analysis, including calculating point estimates, distribution, and frequencies, will be used to summarize and 
characterize the study population.  
8.1.1 Diagnostic performance  
For purposes of diagnostics for G6PD deficiency:  
• A true positive: individuals who displays ≤ 30% (threshold) G6PD activity in circulating venous blood as 
determined by a quantitative assay and in this study specifically the Pointe Scientific Cat No. G7583 . (see table 2).  
• A true negative: individuals who display > 30% (threshold) G6PD activity in circulating venous blood as 
determined by a quantitative assay and in this study specifically the Pointe Scientific Cat No. G7583 . (see table 2).  
In order to investigat e the performance of the assay to distinguish females with intermediate activity from female with 
normal activity, the sensitivity and specificity will be determined at G6PD activity thresholds of 70% and 80%. 70% 
refers to the threshold used in the clinic al trials for tafenoquine as a cure to P. vivax , and 80% refers to the most 
recent WHO G6PD phenotype classification.  
For the purposes of this study, an individual will be considered G6PD deficient (case) if they test positive by [CONTACT_117839] . The primary success criterion will be focused on the ability to identify G6PD -deficient patients 
correctly , such th at the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test on fingerstick blood and the Pointe Scientific assay on venous 
blood should both accurately identify all severe ly G6PD -deficient specimens (with <30% normal) as deficient.  
The performance of the POC G6PD test against the Pointe Scientific assay will be determined by [CONTACT_117840]. Sensitivity and specificity of the POC  G6PD assay will be  calculated as per Domingo et al. 
[19]. In summary, an adjusted male median will be calculated for both the P OC G6PD and Pointe Scientific assay ; 
from this median,  the 30%, 70% , and 80% cutoff levels for the two tests will be used to categorically define G6PD -
deficient cases.  
Sensitivity will be determined using  the following method:  
• TTP = test and true positiv e (positive by [CONTACT_117841] 
G6PD test) . 
• FNTP  = false negative true positive (positive by [CONTACT_117842] G6PD test) . 
• Sensitivity =  TTP/(TTP+FNTP) .  
Specificity will be determined by [CONTACT_117843]:  
13 • TPTN = test positive true negative (negative by [CONTACT_117844] G6PD test) . 
• TTN = test and true negative (negative by [CONTACT_117845] 
G6PD test) . 
• Specificity  = TTN/(TTN+TPTN) .  
Sensitivity and specificity results will be reported using 95% confidence intervals.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_131430] and  the Pointe 
Scientific assay will be plotted, and an R squared value will be determined. The following  R squared value s will be 
considered acceptable : 
1. STANDARD G6PD test G6PD activity on capi[INVESTIGATOR_117816] > 0.[ADDRESS_131431] G6PD activity on venous vs r eference assay on venous blood > 0.[ADDRESS_131432] hemoglobin concentration on capi[INVESTIGATOR_117817] > 0.[ADDRESS_131433] hemoglobin concentration on venous vs reference assay on capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] > 0.[ADDRESS_131434] the  Pointe 
Scientific assay , will be used together with the 95% limits of agreement. Acceptable limits of agreement for Hb should 
be within +/ -1.0 g/dL (based on a 6% estimate for al lowable method bias) and for G6PD activity should be within +/ -
2.0 U G6PD/g Hb (based on a 15% estimate for allowable method bias).  
All statistical analyses will be performed using Stata 13.0.

8.1.3 Interim analysis  
An initial portion of this data will be used to support an FDA 510k submission.  Per CLSI EP09 -A3 (Measurement 
Procedure Comparisons and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved Guideline – Third Edition) , it is 
recommended that measurement validat ion by a manufacturer include at least [ADDRESS_131436] 100 specimens in the G6PD normal range.  The data for this interim 
analysis will come from studies in Brazil and the US. Data collection for these studies are outlined in separate s tudy 
protocols. When the numbers for FDA submission are reached during the trials, a data stop will occur,  and the interim 
data will be cleaned and locked for submission purposes. Sites and investigators will be blinded to the results of the 
interim data a nalysis. The sites will keep enrolling until the numbers required for the WHO PQ are achieved. Should 
any results or observations occur during the continuation of the clinical study (following data cut -off for FDA 
14 submission) which would impact our ability  to demonstrate the safety, effectiveness, or equivalence to the predicate 
devices the FDA will be informed,  and their consultation sought.  
8.2 Data management   
8.2.1 Data entry  
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_117819]/source docu ments at the site. Participant data are 
entered on paper forms at the time the sample is taken and included with the samples sent back to the clinic site lab. 
All paper forms will be tracked by [CONTACT_32221]. Paper forms will be stored after the study en ds in locked cabinets 
at the Seattle MCTC, after which time they will be destroyed following standard site procedures. Data from the paper 
forms will be entered into an electronic database system that is [ADDRESS_131437] -protected.  
8.2.2  Data Access  
The participants will be identified by a study identification number and the patient (clinical) identification number in the 
study database.  The name [CONTACT_117857]. The 
database lin king the participant’s  clinical identification number to the study identification number will be kept by [CONTACT_117847]. All records will be kept locked and all databases will be 
password protected such that clin ic staff and study staff will have access to their respective databases.  
Direct access will be granted to authorized representatives from the sponsor, host institutions and the regulatory 
authorities to permit trial -related monitoring, audits and inspectio ns. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_131438] destruction from the sponsor. No study 
records will be destroyed while study specimens are still being stored. Applicable records include source documents, 
site registratio n documents and reports, informed consent forms, and notations of all contacts with participants.  
8.2.4 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current approved protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonis ation (ICH) good clinical practices (GCP), relevant regulations and standard operating procedures.  
Regular monitoring will be performed according to ICH GCP. Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol 
and accuracy in relation to source docume nts. Study data will be aggregated into a database and an electronic 
monitoring report will be generated every month summarizing key indicators for study compliance. These indicators 
include but are not limited to the number of participants consented, the number of samples acquired, any deviations 
from study procedures, and corrective actions taken. Following written standard operating procedures, the monitors 
will verify that the clinical trial is conducted,  and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the 
protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, a PATH representative will conduct site 
monitoring visits as needed to ensure compliance with the protocol and relevant SOPs.  
9. Benefit and risk considerations  
9.[ADDRESS_131439] their G6PD status tested by a reference assay. This information may inform the  health  care they 
receive in the future.  
G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition that provides valuable clinical information for multiple clinical conditions 
beyond malaria treatment. If clinically relevant results are determined by [CONTACT_117848] —that is, if G6PD activity 
is determined to be deficient or intermediate —participants will receive counseling regarding this information.  
This researc h will also be advantageous for academic study and in the future for other people who will benefit from 
better G6PD tests and malaria treatment.  
9.[ADDRESS_131440] 
practices for blood collection. The volume of blood drawn as part of the study procedures is within the safety limits 
recommended by [CONTACT_117849] 18 [ 20]. In the u nlikely event of a 
research -related injury, cost of treatment will be covered by [CONTACT_117850]. All  decisions regarding clinical care will be made 
through referral to the local health care facilities.   
There is a risk that the confidentiality of participant data will be compromised. The specimens will be inventoried and 
stored by [CONTACT_117851] a s tudy key. Individually identifiable protected health information or data will not be shared , 
except when required during audits by [CONTACT_117852] . All testing 
results will be filed and transferred to the stu dy database as de -identified  data. Results from the investigational test 
may not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by [CONTACT_20904], medically established 
diagnostic product or procedure .  
The study staff are at risk for exp osure to blood -borne pathogens in the course of their work. All study team members 
will adhere to standard procedures for infection control. Study staff exposed to blood -borne pathogens during  their 
study roles will follow their institutional guidelines fo r post -exposure prophylaxis.  
10. Study safety and monitoring  
We anticipate that this evaluation poses minimal risk to participants, as it does not involve any medical intervention 
and blood draw volumes are within acceptable ranges. No data safety monitoring board will be used. The study team  
will conduct necessary staff training on study procedures prior to initiating the evaluation. Only trained users who 
have been certified as proficient in the use of the test will be involved in blood collection. The infor mation participants 
will provide in the context of this evaluation is not considered sensitive and  sharing it will not pose any significant risk 
to them personally or professionally.  
 
10.1 Adverse Event s  
 
10.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE):  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease in a subject that is temporally associated with the use of an investigational product or procedures, eve n if the 
event is not considered to be related to the study product or procedures.  
16 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  An SAE is any AE occurring during study participation that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
- Death  
- Life Threatening (refers to any ev ent in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
- Persistent or significant disabili ty or incapacitation (refers to any event which results in a substantial and/or 
permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions)  
- Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage  
- Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
- Important medical event that may require intervention to prevent one of the preceding conditions.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated  with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious prob lem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. Refer to Protocol Section 8.2 (for a list of anticipated adverse events, 
signs or symptoms. (21CFR -812.3(s))  
 
10.1.2 Adverse Event (AE) Management  
Some reported or obs erved signs and symptoms are inherent to blood specimen collection and are likely to occur 
transiently for nearly all subjects in this study.  Such signs or symptoms will not be considered AEs if they are mild 
(transient, easily tolerated, no interference with daily activities). The following will not be considered AEs:  
- Mild, self -limited pain, swelling, bruising, or brief and minimal bleeding at the collection site  
 
However, these signs and symptoms must be considered AEs and documented on the Adverse Event CRF should 
any of them occur in such a way that the extent or nature of the experience exceeds that normally associated with the 
procedure, as judged by [CONTACT_978], or the event meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  
 
10.1.3 Assess ment of Adverse Events (AEs)  
All AEs must be assessed for Seriousness, Severity, and Relationship. All AEs, regardless of classification, must be 
comprehensively documented in the CRF and on the SAE form, if applicable, and reported.  This includes AEs 
related to marketed study products. The following information about the event is to be reported on the AE CRF:  
- Seriousness, classified as: Non -Serious or Serious  
- Severity, classified as:  
o Mild: Transient symptoms, easily tolerated, no interference with dail y activities  
o Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with daily activities, tolerable  
o Severe: Considerable interference with daily activities, intolerable  
- Relationship to the study product or study procedures , classified as :  
o Not Related: Evidence  suggests absolutely no possible causal relationship between the event and 
the investigational study device (or procedures).  
o Unlikely Related: Evidence suggests that other possible causes or contributing etiological factors 
may have caused the event other than the investigational study device (or procedures).  
o Possibly Related: Evidence suggests a causal relationship between the event and the 
investigational study device (or procedures) cannot be ruled out  
o Related: Evidence suggests a reasonable causal relat ionship between the event and the device (or 
procedures) is likely  
 
In addition, the following should be recorded for each AE:  
- Action(s) taken to remedy the AE, including change in study treatment or participation, or medical/surgical 
treatments  
- Duration o f the AE from onset through resolution, as applicable  
17 - Cause (including suspected product/procedure and/or other cause)  
- Outcome of the event, including resolution and sequelae, as applicable  
 
10.1.4 Additional Procedures for Assessing & Reporting Serious Ad verse Events (SAE)  
SAE criteria are specified in Section 9.1.  All SAEs must also be assessed by [CONTACT_117853]. An adverse event will be considered unexpected or unanticipated if the nature, 
severity or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described in the protocol, 
Informed  Consent, or device instructions for use . 
Any adverse event meeting the criteria for ‘Serious’, regardless of the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_117820], must be reported to PATH  within [ADDRESS_131441] report 
the event by [CONTACT_117854] .  
 
10.1.5 Reporting Obligations to IRB/EC and Health Authorities  
The Investigator must report any adverse events which are serious, unanticipated/unexpected and probably or 
possibly related to the study product or procedures to the reviewing IRB/EC.  This report must be submitted as soon 
as possible, but in no event lat er than [ADDRESS_131442] learns of the event.   
PATH  will provide results of any evaluation of an unanticipated/unexpected adverse device effect to appropriate 
IRB/ECs within [ADDRESS_131443] 
of clinical studies. Assessments will be made regarding the subjects’ protection and safety, when relevant, as well as 
the quality, completeness, and integrity of the data.  
11. Ethical considerations  
11.[ADDRESS_131444]. Additionally, the investigator assures that all activities of this 
protocol will be guided by [CONTACT_117855] 45 US Code of Federal Reg ulations  46 and all of its subparts (A, B, C , and D). Investigators and study staff 
are trained in the protection of human subjects. Training in the principles of informed consent and in the study 
procedures for obtaining informed consent will be conducted  before study initiation.  
11.[ADDRESS_131445]  for review and approval .  
11.4 Amendments  
Amendments to the protocol will not be implemented without agreement from the Sponsor and prior submission to 
and written approval from the governing IRB/EC, except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the 
subject. Notice of an emergency modi fication shall be given to the reviewing IRB/EC as soon as possible, but in no 
event later than [ADDRESS_131446] Informed Consent 
Forms for current and future subjects. Minor changes to the protoco l, such as correction of typographical errors or 
changes in personnel names (other than the PI) or contact [CONTACT_117856]. 
Administrative changes will be submitted to the governing IRB/EC but implementation of the a dministrative change 
may proceed without prior IRB/EC approval, unless so required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC or site SOPs.  
11.[ADDRESS_131447] or the integrity of the study will be reported to 
the appropriate IRBs within 72 hours of when the deviation is identified. All other deviations will be reported in the 
annual contin uing review report.  Significant deviations may also need to be reported to the IRB/EC and local health 
authority. If the Investigator or their staff inadvertently deviates from the study plan, the Investigator should implement 
appropriate corrective and pr eventive procedures .  
11.[ADDRESS_131448] that the research places partic ipants or others at risk, 
including breach of confidentiality , will be promptly reported to the appropriate IRBs within 10 days . A complete 
written report will follow the initial notification. Other incidents will be reported in the annual continuing revie w report.   
11.8 Compensation  
Subjects will be compensated for time and travel to participate in this trial. Subjects will receive $50 for the 
screening/enrollment visit. Information about compensation, including the amount and schedule of payment and 
applicable reporting to the IRS, will also be described in the informed consent form.

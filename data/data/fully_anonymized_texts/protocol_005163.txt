1.0 Purpose of the study:  
 
Charles River Analytics and our collaborators at The New England Consortium 
propose to develop and evaluate an Immersive Modular Preparedness 
Intelligent Tutor (IMPRINT).  IMPRINT aims to enhance trainee performance and set operational expectations outside of the hot zone in hyper -realistic 
exercises that challenge physical, psychological, and cognitive capabilities through adaptive behavioral science enhanced virtual reality (VR) modules and seamlessly integrate with HAZWOPER training. The overall objective of IMPRINT P hase II is to conduct a 1- year randomized -controlled trial among 
regular HAZWOPER Trainees comparing protocol adherence during required hands -on field exercises for trainees who used the IMPRINT behavioral science 
VR training with trainees who received sta ndard PowerPoint and video training. 
 We anticipate trainees and classes assigned to the intervention will perform better than those who use standard paper and PowerPoint based activities. We believe their comprehension of topi[INVESTIGATOR_485090], and it is likely that they will have a greater ability to recall HAZWOPER guidelines in the field. We 
also anticipate after class survey results will indicate a better HAZWOPER training experience and increased levels of satisfaction with the course.  
 Additionally, w e anticipate that trainers using the IMPRINT VR modules will 
find the tool more effective and engaging compared to standard PowerPoint and video- based training methods. We expect that trainers will report greater ease in 
delivering complex HAZWOPER concept s and that the VR modules will 
enhance their ability to facilitate trainee comprehension and recall of HAZWOPER guidelines. We also anticipate that trainer feedback will reflect a more positive teaching experience and higher levels of satisf action with the 
training process.  
 Long- term benefits of participation include improvement in retention of 
HAZWOPER guidelines when responding to Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) disasters.  We anticipate trainees and classes assigned to the intervention will 
perform better than those who use standard paper and PowerPoint based activities. We believe their comprehension of topi[INVESTIGATOR_485090], and it is likely that they will have a greater ability to recall HAZWOPER guidelines in the field. We also anticipate after class survey results will ind icate a better 
HAZWOPER training experience and increased levels of satisfaction with the 
course.  
 
2.0 Background  / Literature Review / Rationale for the study:  
 
 
To successfully transfer skills and develop trainees’ procedural cognitive maps 
VR training systems must enable full immersion into training exercises by 
 [CONTACT_3490] [ADDRESS_623285] haptic interaction and natural walking to 
support spatial skill development, and provide trainer support (Mossel et al., 
2017). Research has shown significant performance benefits from VR delivered targeted mission rehea rsal (Xie et al, 2021). To realize these benefits before 
facing real emergencies, trainees must have the opportunity to hone their skills in a controlled setting that mimics real- life scenarios as closely as possible 
through fully immersive exercises (Moss el et al., 2017). This immersive 
context driven approach is critical for skill transfer and well understood in parallel domains (Mossel, 2020). Immersion is best achieved through a combination of sensations, including haptic (tactile touch, force feedback, temperature, etc.), audio, and visual (simulated detector reads of simulated radiation). Several recent empi[INVESTIGATOR_485091] a domain appropriate way (e.g., heat exposure fire training, or stress inducing stimuli for disaster response).  
 
It is not known whether this skill transfer occurs within the HAZMAT domain, 
or how to best operationalize these findings within training.  
 
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:  
 
We will seek out participants who self -select to participate in the New England 
Consortium (TNEC) training offerings through open enrollment, including populations of any racial or ethnic background.  
 We will also seek out participants who are experienced trainers involved in delivering the New England Consortium (TNEC) training offerings, including trainers from any racial or ethnic background.  
 Participants must meet the eligibility requirements for the class. Given the class requires students to complete standardized HAZMAT training in fully suited PPE with a self -contained breathing apparatus, students must be able to speak 
and understand Engli sh, and not be pregnant. 
 The HAZWOPER certification course falls under TNEC’s o pen enrollment 
courses . TNEC offers on an ongoing basis at their  training center in Lowell, 
[LOCATION_005]. The open enrollment courses generally consist of 15- 25 students 
from various employers or organizations with a variety of backgrounds. Prior to each open enrollment course, TNEC trainers review the student enrollm ent's 
business types, chemical handling information and hazard exposures. Upon this review the trainers will personalize the course to bes t meet the needs of the 
attendees.

4.0 Sample Size : 
 
According to The New England Consortium, during the pandemic they have 
trained approximately 15- [ADDRESS_623287] size. (30- 50 participants)  
 Our study will also include the main evaluation, consisting of 6 randomly selected courses that receive the IMPRINT VR intervention and 6 randomly selected control courses. (180- 300 participants)  
 
This creates a sample of approximately 300 participants.  
5.0 Recruitment and Screening Methods:  
 
Recruitment  process : Given participants opt into training we will use a 
convenience sampling frame. Recruitment will consist of including the term, “Virtual Reality Immersive Activities”, to the existing course title and course link. The current open enrollment advertisement i s available through this link:

6.0 Research Locations:  
 
The evaluation will take place on site at The New England Consortium  (TNEC)  
training center at Wannalancit Mills, as part of the University [LOCATION_005] 
Lowell Campus. The facility is well equipped with the space necessary and standard equipment provided for training. The site is located at the heart of Lowell, offers shuttle bus service, state -of-the-art fiber optic cable and HVAC, 
and [ADDRESS_623288] this 
research at TNEC.

8.0 Procedures Involved:  
 
The standard TNEC [ADDRESS_623289] at the same sequence between cases and controls.  
 
Outcomes measured include student accuracy on the TNEC HAZWOPER performance instruments including;  1) the 40 Hr HazWoper Course Workbook, 
2) the Toxic Properties Activity, 3) The New England Consortium Health and 
Safety Training Survey , 4) System Usability Scale (SUS), 5) Occupational Self -
 Page 7 of 22  v08062019  Efficacy Scale - Short Form (OSS -6), 6) iGroup Presence Questionnaire  (IPQ) , 
7) Flow State Scale (FSS) , 8) UX for VR Questionnaire, and 9 ) NASA- TLX  
 
We will first run a two -month pi[INVESTIGATOR_485092], the intracluster correlation 
coefficient. We will use ICC to determine effect size for the following 12-month study (see Figure 10). Using this calculation, we will determine expected effect size from the more extensive 12- month portion of the evaluation effort. 
 Prior to analysis of the 12- month effort, we will use matching techniques based 
on trainee and trainer characteristics. We will use pretest matching criteria based on trainee cohort population characteristics and prior knowledge ascertained through pre -HAZWOPER training registration infor mation.  
 We will match cases and controls using Euclidian distance between intervention and control samples rather than propensity score matching to find the best match to mitigate risk of confounding due to low sample size following the guidance of [CONTACT_485101] ( King, G. and Nielsen, R., 2019. Why 
propensity scores should not be used for matching. Political Analysis, 27(4), pp.435- 454.). We will compare how these modules enhance student 
performance across TNEC HAZWOPER performance instruments including; 1) the 40 H our HAZWOPER  Course Workbook, 2) the Toxic Properties 
Activity, 3) The New England Consortium Health and Safety Training Survey, 4) System Usability Scale (SUS), 5) Occupational Self -Efficacy Scale -  Short 
Form (OSS -6), 6) iGroup Presence Questionnaire  (IPQ) , 7) Flow State Scale 
(FSS) , 8) UX for VR Questionnaire, and 9) NASA -TLX  
 We will compare how these modules enhance performance through a t -test. 
 Intervention VR modules will be based on the existing activities within the 40 Hour HAZWOPER  Course Workbook and  the field exercise including:

17.0 Potential Benefits  of this Research :  
 
No benefits are promise d. Some benefits might include an improved training 
experience and improved retention of training concepts.  
 
We anticipate trainees and classes assigned to the intervention will perform better than those who use standard paper and PowerPoint based activities. We believe their comprehension of topi[INVESTIGATOR_485090], and it is likely that they 
will have a greater ability to recall HAZWOPER guidelines in the field. We

We also anticipate after class survey results will ind icate a better 
HAZWOPER training experience and increased levels of satisfaction with the course.  
 
  
18.0 Risks to Participants:  
There is a slight chance of injury through falling when walking or moving through the 
room during the tasks performed. There are additional risks when using virtual reality 
equipment or engaging in a virtual environment. These risks are infrequent, but may 
include motion sickness, disorientation, and dizziness. The experi menter will explain 
how you can take breaks during the experiment to prevent or relieve these potential risks, and you will be allowed to stop a task, and if necessary, exit the virtual 
environment by [CONTACT_485096].  
 
This research is no more than minimal risk. The level of risk is expected to about the 
same as risks of daily life or a working with protective equipment used throughout 
training.  
 
19.[ADDRESS_623293] Participant  Privacy and Data 
Confidentiality : 
 
Data collection during training sessions will include written notes of observed 
activities, with a follow -up interview to gain greater context. A demographic 
survey will be administered at the end of each data collection session for all 
participants to col lect information, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and race.  
 
We will make every attempt to not collect identifiable data, but we will also review and de- identify all data. Participants will be assigned a unique, 
anonymous identifier linking them to their data. To protect participant confidentiality, all paperwork that could be directly linked to the participant personally (such as a signed consent form or payment documentation forms) will be stored in the investigators’ locked filing cabinets. All other data will be de-identified (i.e., identified by [CONTACT_485097]) and 
stored in a locked cabinet (different from the cabinet where data that could be 
 Page 20 of 22  v08062019  linked personally to the participant is stored) or on a computer where a 
password is required for entry and/or decryption. The study data will be stored 
on a password protected and encrypted network storage drive that only the Principle Investigator and re search team can access. This system is currently in 
use and has been used in previous studies for storage of human subjects study files. Only properly trained study staff who require data access for the purposes of completing the study will receive a passw ord or key.  
 Data will be stored for 5 years and transferred through VPN secured server.  
 
20.0 Data Monitoring Plan to Ensure the Safety of Participants:  
Data will be monitored monthly by [CONTACT_978](s) given the frequency of the course. 
At that time the safety of equipment will be evaluated and VR Headsets will be 
cleaned.   
 
 
21.0 Long -term Data and Specimen Storage and Sharing :  
We will make every attempt to not collect identifiable data, but we will also 
review and de- identify all data. Participants will be assigned a unique, 
anonymous identifier linking them to their data. To protect participant confidentiality, all paperwork that could be directly linked to the participant personally (such as a signed consent form or payment documentation forms) will be stored in the investigators’ locked filing cabinets. All other data will be de-identified (i.e., identified by [CONTACT_485097]) and 
stored in a locked cabinet (different from the cabinet where data that could be linked personally to the participant is stored) or on a computer where a password is required for entry and/or decryption. The study data will be stored on a password protected and encrypted network storage drive that only the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_485093]. This system is currently in 
use and has been used in previous studies for storage of human subjects study files. Only pr operly trained study staff who require data access for the purposes 
of completing the study will receive a password or key.

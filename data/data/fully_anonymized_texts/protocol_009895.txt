 1 BACK GROUND  
1.1 Background 
 
Novel adjuvants Novel adjuvants are powerful immune stimulants employed in vaccine platforms to 
improve immunogenicity and efficacy ( 1). In recent years, the FDA licensed several 
vaccines with novel adjuvants . More vaccines with novel adjuvants are in pre- clinical 
development and in clinical trials (2). Clinicians may opt to administer these vaccines 
simultaneously.  Vaccines with novel adjuvants are more reactogenic than vaccines 
without adjuvants and there is a theoretical possibility that novel adjuvants could activate immune- mediated disease in some individuals ( 3). In addition, one investigational 
COVID -19 vaccine uses recombinant spi[INVESTIGATOR_188921] a saponin- based Matrix -M 
adjuvant.  Therefore, data are needed on the safety of the simultaneous administration of vaccines with novel adjuvants.

Zoster vaccine 
For older adults, the need for data on simultaneous administration of vaccines with novel 
adjuvants has specific clinical relevance for the prevention of influenza and herpes zoster. 
Herpes zoster is a painful neurocutaneous disease caused by [CONTACT_188935] (VZV) from dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia (9). The incidence of herpes zoster and chronic pain following zoster, known as postherpetic neuralgia, 
increases markedly with aging (4). A live attenuated zoster vaccine (Zoster Vaccine Live, 
ZVL; Zostavax, [COMPANY_006] and Co., Inc) was licensed in 2006 and recommended by [CONTACT_159328] ( ACIP ) for the prevention of herpes zoster 
in immunocompetent adults aged ≥50 years old (5). An adjuvanted recombinant zoster

 vaccine (RZV; Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline) was licensed in 2017 and recommended by [CONTACT_188936] ≥50 years (6). Due to the 
superior efficacy of RZV compared to ZVL,  ZVL is no longer sold in the U.S  RZV contains 
the novel adjuvant AS01B and recombinant glycoprotein E ( 7). AS01B is composed of 
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) from Salmonella minnesota and QS - 21, a saponin purified 
from plant extract Quillaja saponaria Molina, combined in a liposomal formulation (7). RZV 
is administered as a 2 -dose series intramuscularly 2- 6 months apart (7). 
In the ZOE -50 and ZOE -70 phase III clinical trials of RZV versus placebo , 17% of vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ≥50 years old and 12% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ≥70 years old reported any grade 3 
adverse event (reactions related to vaccination that prevented normal activities) ( 8, 9). 
Grade 3 injection- site reactions (pain, redness, and swelling) were reported by 9.4% of 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_188922] 3 solicited systemic events (myalgia, fatigue, headache, 
shivering, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms) were reported by 10.8 % of vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (8, 9). The proportion of grade 3 reactions decreased with increasing age. The 
rates of serious adverse events and potential immune- mediated disease over the study 
periods were similar in the RZV and placebo groups ( 8, 9). 
Influenza vaccine 
Influenza is a serious acute viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_188923] A or B viruses. Older adults are at high risk for influenza- related morbidity and mortality due to 
immunosenescence and age -related diseases (10-12). For persons aged ≥65 years, the 
ACIP recommends any age -appropriate IIV formulation (standard dose or high dose, 
trivalent or quadriv alent, unadjuvanted or adjuvanted) or  RIV4 as acceptable options (13). 
Influenza vaccines licensed by [CONTACT_188937] ≥[ADDRESS_223078] dose vaccines ( 13). Unadjuvanted trivalent high- dose 
inactivated influenza vaccine (HD -IIV3; Fluzone
® High-Dose; [COMPANY_011] Pasteur), licensed in 
2010, and unadjuvanted quadrivalent high- dose inactivated influenza vaccine, licensed in 
2019 (HD -IIV4; Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent; [COMPANY_011] Pasteur) contain four times the 
amount of hemagglutinin antigen compared with standard dose unadjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines ( 14, 15). 
Trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine [aIIV3; FLUAD; Seqirus Inc.], and 
Quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine [aIIV4; FLUAD
® Quadrivalent, 
Seqirus Inc. ], contain MF59, a - squalene-- based adjuvant ( 14, 16). 
In studies that evaluated the safety of aIIV3 and HD -IIV3 versus trivalent , standard  dose, 
unadjuvanted, inactivated influenza vaccine (SD- IIV3), aIIV3 and HD -IIV3 had  higher rates 
of moderate- to-severe reactions compared with SD -IIV3 (16, 17) but grade 3 adverse 
events were reported by <2% of participants for each solicited local and systemic reaction 
(16, 17). Rates of serious adverse events were similar in the aIIV3 versus SD -IIV3 groups 
and in the HD -IIV3 versus the SD -IIV3 groups. A CDC Clinical Immunization Safety 
Assessment (CISA) Project prospective, randomized clinical trial found that moderate-severe injection- site pain was not higher after aIIV3 compared with HD -IIV3 in adults aged 
≥65 years (18), (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]). The rates of serious adverse 
events over the study periods were similar in the aIIV3 and HD- IIV3 groups (18).

 1.2 Summary and Rationale 
 
Study Rationale  
In clinical practice, the use of RZV has replaced the use of ZVL in older adults ( 19). 
The use of high -dose and adjuvanted influenza vaccines is increasingly more common 
than use of standard -dose unadjuvanted influenza vaccine in adults ≥65 years (20). 
The simultaneous administration of RZV and either high- dose and adjuvanted 
influenza vaccines at the same healthcare visit is more convenient for patients and 
providers and increases the probability that individuals will be fully vaccinated. 
Unpublished data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services suggest that 
simultaneous  administration of RZV and aIIV3 is already occurring in some adults 
aged ≥[ADDRESS_223079] Practices Guidelines for Immunization does not address simultaneous administration of vaccines with novel adjuvants (21). A randomized clinical 
trial to evalu ate the safety of simultaneous administration of RZV and a quadrivalent 
standard -dose unadjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (SD -IIV4) observed no safety 
concerns with either vaccine ( 22). However, there are no data on the safety of the 
simultaneous administration of RZV and  aIIV3 or aIIV4. Simultaneous administration of 
RZV and aIIV4 is not labeled as a contraindication ( 7, 16). Because of lack of data on the 
safety of simultaneous administration of aIIV3 or aIIV4 with other vaccines containing novel adjuvants and availability of non- adjuvanted influenza vaccines, ACIP Influenza 
vaccine recommendations for the 2019 -2020 season state: “selection of a nonadjuvanted 
influenza vaccine may be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing a novel adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly”  (13). 
Because RZV and aIIV4 contain different novel adjuvants and will be simultaneously administered by [CONTACT_188938] , it is important to evaluate if simultaneous 
administration of both vaccines increases the risk for severe reactogenic events compared 
with simultaneous administration with RZV with a non- adjuvanted vaccine. HD -IIV4 was 
selected as  the unadjuvanted comparator influenza vaccine as the use of HD -IIV has 
increasingly become the  standard of care. In addition, prospectively collecting detailed 
clinical information about other adverse events such as immune -mediated diseases after 
simultan eous vaccination with RZV and aIIV4 could also help advance understanding of 
safety of simultaneous use of vaccines with novel adjuvants in adults. We propose 
conducting a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety of simultaneous administration 
of RZV (dose 1) and aIIV4 among older adults.  A randomized controlled trial is the 
strongest design to fill these knowledge gaps and address the limitations of observational data collected from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and Vaccine 
Safety Datalink (VSD). The information gained from this trial will be novel in that it will likely 
be the first in human study. It will lead to a better understanding of the safety of the 
simultaneous administration of these specific vaccines specifically  and novel adjuvants in 
general. These findings are important to the health of older adults and to potentially more efficient vaccine delivery.

simultaneous  admi nistration of vaccines with novel adjuvants. Findings from this study may 
advance the health of older  adults. By [CONTACT_188939], we may  reduce the number of health care visits and 
avoid vaccination delays, which is especially important if SARSCoV -2 (COVID -19) continues 
to circulate. This information may also be useful if a SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_223081] is introduced in the future.

4.3 Recruitment  
Participants ≥65 years of age will be recruited  from several sourc es at Duke University Medical 
Center  (DUMC)  and Johns Hopkins  University using varying techniques.   Study investigators 
will enroll at least 220 persons  at Duke over two seasons ( ~110 participants per season)  and 
~180 persons at Johns Hopkins  over two seasons ( ~90 per season) .     
 The general techniques for how subjects will be recruited include the following:  Study staff, 
including PIs and study nurses, will approach their patients in clinic directly about the study 
during clinic visits; notify other health care professionals in their health system about the study 
via letters and flyers for potential referrals; notify potential subjects about the study via study 
registries and recruitment service programs;  letters and talks to senior groups in various 
venues including Senior Centers and Continuin g Care Retirement Communities; advertising in 
newspapers; flyers posted at senior locations; letters and talks to potential referral sources; and 
letter campaigns to older adults in t he surrounding catchment area. More specific mechanisms 
to DUMC and JHU  are described below.   
 
At DUMC potential subjects will be approached via the following mechanisms :  1) Elderly  
participants of previous vaccine studies who have agreed to enroll in future studies; 2) Duke 
Center for Aging Human Subjects Registry, a unique long- standing registry of over 3000 
individuals who volunteer for human studies; 3)  Advertising in senior citizen newspapers and 
general newspapers in the Durham, Chapel Hill and Raleigh areas;  4) Letter campaign to 
households of older adults; 5) Duke Geriatric Evaluation and Treatment Clinic (GET Clinic) and 
Duke University Hea lth System primary care clinics ; 6) Triangle continuing care retirement 
communities ; 7) Duke’s “Aging” network of senior centers; senior activities; and referrals from 
professionals who work with seniors cultivated via the work of the Center for Aging.  These 
sources  are likely to be sufficient, but if not , we will utilize oth er past suc cessful strategies . An 
additional strategy will be the ability to send targeted notifications to potential participants 
through MaestroCare for Research tools . This has worked well on recent clinical trials.    
 
Simultaneous RZV and aIIV4   Version 8.0

 At JHU subjects will be approached through 1 ) Johns Hopkins Frailty Registry, which as of 
January 2020 had over 1000 older adults enrolled; 2) Physiologic and Molecular Basis of the 
Syndrome of Frailty study , which contains 405 unique participants all over the age of 65; 3) 
COVID -19 vaccine trials,  which enrolled several hundred healthy elderly individuals in 2020; 4) 
Database of prior volunteers at the Center for Immunization Research (CIR). If these are not 
sufficient, the CIR currently employs a variety of methods to recruit study participants fo r both 
outpatient and inpatient trials . Current recruitment materials include the CIR and recruitment 
campaign logos, volunteerism -based photos and the Center’s recruitment slogan, “ Bringing 
Immunity to Every Community ” to build brand recognition and bring  awareness to upcoming 
studies at the Center. Flyers and IRB -approved recruitment scripts are posted to social media 
(CIR Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and websites that cater to people who are interested in 
study participation. For community outreach, we partner with local broadcast, cable television, 
and OTT (over -the-top) providers to run 15-  and 30- second commercials that are IRB -approved 
under our general screening protocol.  
 
At all sites, potential participants  may be approached by [CONTACT_25600] , email o r text .  The study will 
be reviewed with the participant , and if they are  interested , then initial eligibility screening will take 
place on the phone following an IRB -approved script.   A waiver of documentation of consent will 
be approved from the reviewing IRB in order to carry out these screening activities.  
4.4 Reasons for and Handling of Withdrawals  
The following may be reason for study withdrawal:  
• As deemed necessary by [CONTACT_458] (PI) .  
• Subject withdrawal of consent.  
• Loss to follow -up. 
• Subject unable to return for study appointments . 
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_456].  
 Subjects may withdraw their consent for study participation at any time and for any reason, 
without penalty. Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to randomizat ion will be replaced. 
Subjects who withdraw from the study after randomization will not be replaced. Data collected 
before withdrawal will still be used for analysis.  
4.5 Termination of Study  
This study may be terminated for safety concerns of the principal investigator s from the Lead or 
Contributing sites, CDC, or participating Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ).

End of Study  
At the conclusion of the study, the statistician will unblind the vaccine type for each participant. 
The study staff will  contact  [CONTACT_188945] . Study 
staff will  provide two copi[INVESTIGATOR_188925]: one copy for the subject ’s personal 
records and the second copy will be given to their respective primary care provider. Subjects will 
be responsible for informing their primary care provider about which vaccine they received.  
Study staff will send the subjects a separate  letter  with a plain language summary of the main 
results of  the study when available and thanking them for their participation.   The main results 
will not be provided to participants earlier than public release of the findings.  
 
5.2 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
This study is a prospective, randomized,  blinded clinical trial involving subjects  aged ≥65 years 
of age who are to receive RZV and allV4 or RZV and HD -IIV4 simultaneously.   
  
5.2.1  Randomization  
Participants aged 65 to 69 will be randomized (1:1) to receive either simultaneous RZV / aIIV4 or 
RZV /  HD-IIV4 using a permuted block randomization scheme stratified by [CONTACT_188946]. A separate permuted block will be allocated for subjects who are age [ADDRESS_223106] statistician will prepare 20 envelopes per  participant  age group per site 
(total of 40 per site) that will use the same randomization strategy as the primary scheme 
embedded in REDCap. When an unblinded team member is informed of the participant’s  age 
group, he/she will pull the next envelope in order. In orde r to capture the allocation per subject, 
a separate form in REDCap will be used by [CONTACT_188947]. A 
log will need to be kept at the site capturing these instances . 
5.3 Data Collection  
5.3.1  Vaccine Supply, Storage, Administration , and  Blinding  
In order to ensure adherence to study randomization assignment, licensed RZV, aIIV4 and 
HD-IIV4 vaccines will be administered as study procedures. Licensed RZV, aIIV4 and HD -
IIV4 vaccines (prefilled syringes) will be purchased for study administration and maintained 
at the Duke and JHU study centers, stored at 2° to 8°C in a research -specific medication 
refrigerator. While research staff maintain daily temperature logs for the medication 
refrigeration, it is also monitored 24/[ADDRESS_223107] to report to the 
research center for further investigation. Any potentially compromised vaccine will be 
quarantined for further disposition based on site - specific SOPs, investigator  assessment  
and communication with the respective vaccine manufacturers . Shingrix ([COMPANY_004]), FLUADTM 
(Seqirus) and Fluzone High -Dose ([COMPANY_011]) will be the designated study products.  
Administration of aIIV4 comprising of intramuscular del ivery of 0.[ADDRESS_223108] 15  
minutes after vaccine administration while at the study site. They will be assessed for the 
following potential systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis related symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, 
chest tightness, wheezing, cough, stridor, urticarial, flushing, nasal congestion, dizziness, 
syncope, diaphoresis, emesis) or other medical symptoms (e.g., feverishness 
(chills/shivering/sweating), fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and 
gastrointestinal symptoms ( nausea , vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain). They will be 
assessed for any potential injection site reactions including pain, erythema  or induration. 
Pain severity will be assessed on a 0 –  [ADDRESS_223109] memory aid. Unsolicited adverse 
events (AEs) will be assessed daily through post -vaccination Day 42 following each 
vaccination visit. Serious AEs (SAEs) and adverse events of clinical interest including new 
onset of immune -mediated diseases and concomitant medication use will be assessed daily 
through the entire period of a subject’s participation.  
At the time of study enrollment, participants will be given a thermometer and instructed on 
using the symptom diary to document oral temperatures and post -injection symptoms. 
Beginning on the evening of Study Visit 1 (Day 1) following vaccination, participants will 
record their oral temperature using the study -supp lied thermometer, the occurrence of 
AEs, and concomitant medication use for the next 8 days (Day 1 –  8). Temperature will be 
recorded at roughly the same time each day. If a temperature ≥  100.0° F (37.8° C) is 
recorded, a second measurement will be taken. If  more than one temperature is taken on 
the same day, the highest temperature should be recorded. Fever will be defined as a 
measured temperature ≥ 100.0°F (37.8 °C). Participants will be queried during Visits 3 
and 7 on any solicited adverse events following vaccination and during Visits 3 and 7 on 
solicited injection site adverse events, which will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe 
as described by [CONTACT_188948] 2. Injection site reactogenicity will be assessed separately for IIV4 
and RZV.

Participants will be encouraged to report any significant adverse and serious adverse 
events in an open -ended question format, e.g. “How are you doing? Are you having any 
medical or clinical problems? If so, please tell me about them.” Participants who report 
severe solicited adverse events or express any concern about symptoms/unsolicited 
events will be encouraged to follow up with their primary care provider. Study staff will 
assist with coordination of referral appointments as necessary. Medical records will be 
obtained and reviewed for any serious adverse events or new onset immune- mediated 
diseases throughout the study period. 
RZV, aIIV4 and HD -IIV4 are recommended for routine immunization for older adults 
such that we do not anticipate having a significant issue with serious adverse events 
(SAEs). An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions:  
• Results in  death during the period of protocol- defined surveillance 
• Is life -threatening (defined  as immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188926] -defined  surveillance  
• Results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth  defect  
• Results in a persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Any other  important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above 
 
SAEs will be reported to the CDC , DUHS , and JHU  IRBs within 48 hours of study staff 
awareness of the event. If indicated, SAEs will be reported through the CDC’s VAERS system. 
We will also collect information regarding the occurrence of any new onset immune-mediated diseases  (Appendix F). We will monitor study participants for the development of 
new onset immune- mediated diseases throughout the study period.

We will monitor study participants for the development of new onset acute or chronic medical 
conditions during the protocol -defined surveillance period of [ADDRESS_223111] -vaccination.   These 
AEs will be reviewed periodically by a safety -monitoring  panel (Section 5.4.4 ). We will monitor 
study participants for SAEs during the protocol -defined surveillance period of [ADDRESS_223112] 24 hours after immunization, and new onset immune- mediated 
disease as defined in Appendix  F. 
 
5.4.2  Causality (relatedness) Assessment  
Study site investigators will assess relatedness to vaccine or study procedures (related, possibly related, unlikely related, or not related) for SAEs, AEs, and AEs of clinical interest. Relatedness 
determinations of these events will inform IRB reporting and safety monitoring ( Section 5.4.3 ).    
Solicited symptoms in Error! Reference source not found.  will all be considered to be related to 
vaccine and causality assessment will not be done for these events. The study investigators will use their clinical judgement to make causality assessments and may consult the Expert Safety 
Panel or CISA Project for assistance with causality determinations. The final causality 
assessment decision is the responsibility  of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_188927].  
 5.4.3  Reporting of Adverse Events 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  
If indicated, AEs occurring during the study  will be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System (VAERS). The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires healthcare 
providers to report the following AEs to VAERS:  
• Any adverse event listed by [CONTACT_29386] a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine; or  
• Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following 
Vaccination  [ PDF - 75KB]  that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination.  
In addition, CDC encourages reporting of any clinically significant adverse event that occurs in a 
patient following a vaccination, even if there is uncertainty regarding if a vaccine caused the 
event.

 Vaccine- related  SAEs will be medically attended per routine care.  
 
SAEs will be reported promptly to the overseeing IRBs in accordance with institutional 
procedures.  Any unanticipated problems resulting from study conduct related to participation will 
be reported promptly to the reviewing IRBs and CDC, in accordance with institutional 
procedures.  
 
The period for monitoring and reporting SAEs will occur for the duration of study participation 
(42-days post vaccination)  
 The study will report only SAEs occurring during each subject’s participation in the study.

and ensure adequate communication of potential risks, and to provide situational awareness of 
potential safety signals from this study to CDC Immunization Safety Office (ISO) leadership.  
This plan is designed to monitor safety while minimizing introduction of bias  into the study and 
minimizing burden to study investigators .  The safety monitoring plan is described in Appendix  
G.   
 
5.4.5  EQ-5D and EQ VAS Scale  
The EQ-5D is a standardized, generic measure of health status that provides information on 
health- related quality of life and activities of daily living relevant  to older adults:  mobility, self-
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression ( http://www.euroqol.org/ ) (23
). In 
addition, the instrument contains the EQ Visual Analogue Scale (EQ -VAS) which measures  the 
respondent’s self -rated health.  
 
The EQ -5D-5L is the new version of the EQ -5D that increases the levels of severity from three 
to five to significantly increase reliability and sensitivity while maintaining feasibility and reducing 
ceiling effects ( Appendix  H) (24, 25).The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression.  For each of these dimensions, 
there are 5 response levels:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by 
[CONTACT_188949]4   Version 8.[ADDRESS_223115] appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensi ons. This 
decision results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits 
for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5- digit number describing the respondent’s health state 
from [ADDRESS_223116] health.  These numbers are converted to a Utility 
Index that ranges from -0.109 (worst health) to 1.000 (best health) for US specific values.  The 
minimum clinically important difference ranges from 0.05 to 0.1 depending on health conditions 
being studied. The EQ VAS  records the respondent’s self -rated health on a 20 cm vertical, 
visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled ‘the best health you can imagine’ (100) and ‘the 
worst health you can imagine’ (0).  The respondent marks an ‘X’ on the scale number to indicate 
how their health is ‘today.’ The minimum clinically important difference on the VAS is 8.  
 
The EQ -5D-5L, EQ -VAS have several advantages for use in this study.  The measure is 
applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments and provide a simple descriptive 
profile and a single index value for health status.  It has been validated in US and international 
populations and in older adults  (23, 26, 27). The measure is useful for monitoring the health 
status of patient groups at different moments in time and assessing the seriousness of 
conditions at different moments in time.  The measure is designed for self -completion by 
[CONTACT_170496].  It is simple, straightforward, tak e only a few minutes to complete and can easily 
be completed by [CONTACT_21140].  The instrument was designed to reduce respondent burden while 
achieving standards of precision for purposes of group comparisons involving multiple health 
dimensions.  It has been widely used throughout the world in many different studies, including 
randomized controlled clinical trials, vaccine studies, and health -related quality of life studies in 
older adults . 
           
5.5 Health Care Utilization  
Participants will be asked to report health care utilization including: telephone calls to the 
medical provider for medical advice, e-mail portal, elect ronic health record, clinic visits, urgent 
care visits, emergency department visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188928] 43 according to the schedule in Error! Reference source not found.  above.  The reason for health 
care use will also be obtained. Electronic or paper health records will be obtained and reviewed 
to confirm reports of clinic visits, urgent care visits, emergency department visi ts and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124021]. Health care utilization and the reason for health care utilization will be recorded on 
the symptom  diary . 
5.6 Biospecimens Collection & Handling  
5.6.1  Serum  
Blood specimens will be collected during study visits as described in Error! Reference source 
not found. . 
All blood samples ( ≈15 mL) will be collected into serum separator tubes and processed as 
follows:  
• Allow blood to c lot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes  while standing upright in a 
rack. 
• Centrifuge tube within 8  hours of collection at 1100 to 1300 RCF(g) for 10 minutes.  
• Gently remove the vacutainer stopper avoiding serum contamination with red blood 
cells. Using a single -use pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], transfer 1.0 mL aliquots of serum (top layer) into 
Simultaneous RZV and aIIV4   Version 8.0 
June 20, 2024  
 
  
 
 
29 
 
 
 1.0mL or 1.8 mL cryovials, u p to 5 cryovials are expected.  If less than 1 mL of 
processed serum is  collected, it is a protocol deviation 
• All cryovial aliquots will be b arcode labelled and contain a unique identifier via REDCap .  
Numbers should be placed lengthwise on the tube.  
• Freeze the cryovials at - 80°C in the temperature- monitored research center freezer for 
future shipment.   
• Serum aliq uots will be stored in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute Accessioning  Lab, and 
the Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188929]  
6 LABORATORY ANALYSES  
6.1 Influenza Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Assay 
Influenza Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Assays will be performed on sera collected , 
contingent on additional funding.  Briefly, r eference wild- type, reassortant, or vaccine virus 
strains representative of the specific viral antigens included in the [ADDRESS_223117] using the influenza hemagglut ination inhibition assay  (HAI).  This 
assay is considered the “gold- standard” measure by [CONTACT_188950]/seroprotection in response to seasonal influenza vaccination. This assay will be performed in accordance with the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory Virology Unit’s 
fully optimized and approved SOP (RVUSOP004  Influenza HI of Serum Samples).  Briefly, te st 
samples will be assayed by H AI as duplicate 2- fold dilution series starting at 1:10.  Serum 
dilutions are then incubated with a c oncentration of virus verified to possess a known potential 
for red blood cell (RBC) agglutination.  The presence of virus -specific antibodies is visualized 
via incubation of the virus -serum mixture with a RBC solution; the endpoint titer for a given 
dilution series is then expressed as the reciprocal of the final dilution in which complete H AI is 
observed.  By [CONTACT_559], seronegative samples are defined as having an endpoint H AI titer <  
40 and seropositive samples as having an endpoint titer of ≥ 1:40; and  seroconversion as a 4 -
fold change in endpoint titer relative to pre -immunization baseline or a change from <10 to 
≥1:40 (28). 
 
7 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
In collaboration with the Johns Hopkins  site, t he research team at Duke will oversee the 
statistical analysis. D ata will reside on a secure Duke server  maintained by [CONTACT_174886] (DHTS) .  For the study, a database will be developed and a data  set for 
the study without personal identifiers will be made available to the CDC upon request.   Duke 
statisticians will develop a comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan.  The summary points of the 
analysis plan are presented below.  
7.1 Analysis Plan  
 
Simultaneous RZV and aIIV4   Version 8.0 
June 20, 2024  
 
  
 
 
30 
 
 
 Should an interim safety analysis be required, the alpha level will be adjusted to assure the 
overall type I error is maintained at the one-sided alpha 0.02 5 level for the primary outcome of 
non-inferiority.   
7.1.1  Sample Size  
 
Safety : Based on information in fr om the pre -licensure trials for RZV, we assume that 14% of 
adults ≥[ADDRESS_223118] selected a clinically meaningful noninferiority margin of 10%. Statistical 
calculations, without consideration of drop- out, show that with a one -side alpha level of 0.025, 
we would need 380 total subjects (190 subjects in each group across all study  sites) to have at 
least 80% power to be able to demonstrate that the proportion of adults ≥[ADDRESS_223119] 
one severe solicited local or systemic reactogenicity event after RZV dose 1 is noninferior after RZV and allV4 versus RZV and HD -IIV4. Assum ing a 5% drop out rate, we plan to recruit and 
randomize 400 total  subjects. 
 
7.1.2  Analysis Populations  
 
Intention- to-Treat (ITT) Population : 
For Secondary Objective 3 and Exploratory Objectives 4 and 9, the primary analysis population 
will be the ITT Population; defined as all subjects who are randomized and vaccinated.  
 
Modified Intention- to-Treat (mITT) Population : 
For Primary Objective 1, Secondary Objectives 1 and 2, and Exploratory Objectives 1, 2,  3, 5 
and 6 the primary analysis population will be the mITT  Population; defined as all subjects who 
are randomized, vaccinated, and provide at least one day of complete data on the symptom 
diary.  
 Immunogenicity Population:  
For Exploratory Objectives 7 and 8 ( immunogenicity analyses ) the primary analysis population 
will be the Immunogenicity  Population 2 ; defined as subjects who received vaccine, provide 
baseline and Visit 4 blood draws of acceptable volume and quality within the protocol -defined 
time fr ame with no protocol violations  affecting immunogenicity . Protocol violations affecting the 
immunogenicity analyses will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 
 
7.1.3  Primary Objective 1  
• To compare the proportion of older adults with at least one severe (Grade 3) solicited 
local or systemic reactogenicity event after RZV dose 1 in the RZV and aIIV4 group vs. 
RZV and HD -IIV4 group.  
 
o Hypothesis: The proportion of participants with at least one severe (Grade 3) 
solicited reactogenicity event after RZV  dose 1  will be noninferior (not higher) in 
the RZV and aIIV4 group compared with the RZV and HD- IIV4 group  
Simultaneous RZV and aIIV4   Version 8.[ADDRESS_223120] with the alpha level set 
at 0.025 and noninferiority margin of 10%. The null hypothesis is RZV and allV4 is inferior 
(i.e., RZV and allV4 will have a higher proportion) to RZV and HD -IIV4 in regards to the 
proportion of adults with at least one severe (Grade 3) solicited local or systemic 
reactogenicity event after RZV does 1.  
 
Ho: RZV and allV4 -  RZV and HD -IIV4 ≥ 0.10 (10%)  
 
The alternative hypothesis is RZV and allV4 is noninferior to RZV and HD -IIV4 in regards 
to the proportion of adults with at least one severe (Grade 3) solicited local or systemic 
reactogenicity event after RZV  dose  1. 
 
Ha: RZV and allV4 -  RZV and HD -IIV4 < 0.10 (10%)  
 
The upper bound of a site- stratified Newcombe binomial confidence interval with Cochran-  
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting of the difference will be used to make this assessment  
(29). 
7.1.[ADDRESS_223121] 95% confidence 
intervals. The confidence intervals will be used to make comparisons and interpretations. 
For Exploratory Objective 7, seroconversion or seroprotection at day 29 will be compared 
using a Mantel -Haenszel  statistic in a stratified analysis by [CONTACT_3725].  HAI titer (GMTs) and t he 
geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in HAI titer  will be compared using a regression model 
that will control for site  or nonparametric testing if normalit y assumptions are not met . 
For Exploratory Objective 8, the EQ -5D-5L responses are converted to a U tility Index that 
ranges from - 0.109 (worst health) to 1.0 (best health)  using the US specific value sets 
(http://www.euroqol.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/Excel/Crosswalk_5L/EQ -5D-
5L_Crosswalk_Value_Sets.xls ).  The EQ V AS has a range of 0 (worst health) to 100 (best 
health). The changes from baseline will be assessed within vaccine group using a paired t-test 
for the index values and VAS.  If normality assumptions are not met, the testing will be performed with a Wilcoxon signed -rank test. The Mann- Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank -sum test) 
will be used to compare the difference scores from baseline between the two vaccine groups for 
the index values and VAS.   
 
Proportions for all objectives will be presented in tables and the noninferiority comparisons 
will be presented in graphical displays as well. There will be no adjustment to the alpha 
level for these comparisons, with all noninferiority comparisons at the one -side alpha 
0.025 level with a 10% noninferiority margin. The alpha level will be set at the two- side 
0.05 level for Exploratory Objectives 7, 8, and 9.

 7.2 Data Management  
The novel Vanderbilt -designed resource developed specifically for online collection of research 
information, the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform  
(https://projectredcap.org/ ), will be used to design study forms, including the reaction forms, and 
short customized questionnaires to collect information from study subjects. REDCap provides: 
1) a streamlined process for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_188930] a database; 2) an intuitive interface for collecting 
data, with data validation and audit trail; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data 
downloads to common statistical packages; 4) branching logic, file uploading, and calculated fields; and 5) a quick and easy protocol set -up. This system will be used by [CONTACT_188951].  All electronic linkages will fulfill regulations for protection of human subjects and 
requirements to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality.  
 
All study -related documents containing protected health information, e.g. enrollment logs, case 
report forms, diaries (Appendix  E) completed by [CONTACT_19288], will be maintained in secure 
research offices at Duke and Johns Hopkins University , which are accessible to research staff 
only.  
 The study team will utilize a secure, encrypted, file transfer method for sharing study documents 
and data with the CDC.   No personal identifiers will be included in any shared documents or 
datasets.    
 
7.2.1  Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
REDCap ( http://project- redcap.org/ ) assists with the collection  and management of  data for 
diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed around the concept 
of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_174848], 
web-based applications for collection, management and sharing of research data. REDCap 
accomplishes these key functions through use of a single study metadata table referenced by [INVESTIGATOR_44605]- level operational modules. Based on this abstracted programming model, 
databases are developed in an efficient manner with little resource investment beyond the 
creation of a single data dictionary. The concept of metadata- driven application development is 
well established, and the critical factor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple workflow methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related 
metadata in an efficient manner. Both products include secure institutional data hosting and 
include full audit -trails in com pliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) security requirements. The REDCap Consortium is comprised of [ADDRESS_223122] .  The Duke University  PI (Ken S chmader ) will oversee 
the study  in partnership with the  Johns Hopkins University , PI (Kawsar Talaat ).  CDC staff will 
collaborate with both sites to develop the protocol, conduct the study, ensure the study is 
aligned with US Department of Health and Human Services (CDC)  public health priorities, and 
analyze the data and disseminate the results. CDC may receive access to coded data not 
containing any directly identifying information.   
 
8    HUMAN SUBJECTS  
8.1 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
 
Duke  and Johns  Hopkins  University  investigators will be responsible for submitting the protocol, 
informed consent  (Appendix  A), diaries (Appendix  E), recruitment letters  (Appendix  I), flyers 
(Appendix  J), and any written or verbally conveyed materials  (Appendix  K) specific to this 
project to their institutional review boards.  CDC staff will be responsible for submitting materials 
to the CDC for  Human Subjects  review and approval .   
  
To facilitate subject recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent  and HIPAA 
authorization for ascertainment (identification, selection) and/or recruitment of potential subjects while recording identifiable private health information (PHI)  prior to obtaining the subject’s 
consent.  This information will be obtained from review of the electronic scheduling and medical 
record systems in the clinics  in order to determine eligibility for study enroll ment. We will review 
only the minimum amount of information necessary to determine eligibility, i.e. dat e of birth, 
medical and surgical history, and recent laboratory test results. The PHI collected prior to 
consent will be used to recruit and screen only . Use of PHI in this manner involves no more than 
minimal risk to subjects and no information will leave the study sites . 
 
Requests for continuing review, when required, will be submitted at each engaged institution in 
accordance with institutional procedures.   Protocol deviations or concerns about study integrity 
will be reported promptly to the overseeing IRB  or CDC in accordance with institutional 
requirements . 
Simultaneous RZV and aIIV4   Version 8.[ADDRESS_223123] solicited adverse reactogenicity events and any medical intervention 
sought on study days 1-8 on the symptom  diary  (Appendix  E).  Diary  information will be reported 
to the study team during a telephone call. The research staff will assess one or more of the following:  weight, height, temperature, blood pressure, and pulse.   
8.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
RZV, aIIV4, and IIV-HD4 are FDA -licensed vaccines approved for use in adults ≥[ADDRESS_223124] clinical practice and recommended by [CONTACT_6750].  Participants will 
be provided with the CDC  Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for IIV and RZV 
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/flu.pdf
 and 
https:/ /www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/shingles -recombinant.pdf ).  
 
 
Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines . Sitting or 
lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall , as 
recommended in the ACIP General Recommendations on Immunization( 30). Subjects should 
inform their doctor should they feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.  
 IIV risks include  minor problems  such as soreness, redness, swelling, or pain where the shot 
was given, hoarseness, sore, red or itchy eyes, cough, fever, aches, headache, itching, fatigue, 
all of which usually occur within 1- [ADDRESS_223125] difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given. Thi s 
happens very rarely. More serious problems including a small increased risk of Guillain -Barré 
Syndrome estimated at 1 or 2 additional cases per million people vaccinated. This is much 
lower than the risk of severe complications from influenza infection, which can be prevented by 
[CONTACT_174880](31).  In addition, any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, which 
is estimated at ~ 1 in one million doses of IIV  administered ( 32). 
 RZV risks include pain, redness, itching and swelling in the arm  where the shot was given. 
These side effects were usually mild; however,  occasional severe local reactions, mainly pain 
was reported. These local reactions usually went away within 3 to 4 days. Systemic side effects 
include tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, headache, chills, fever, and digestive symptoms 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or stomach ache) and feeling generall y unwell (malaise). These 
symptoms were also usually mild and resolved within few days.  About 1 out of 6 people who receive RZV experienced side effects that prevented them from doing regular activities like 
yardwork or swimming.  More serious problems including a small increased risk of Guillain -
Barré Syndrome estimated at 3 to 6 additional cases per million people vaccinated. This is 
much lower than the risk of severe complications from herpes zoster infection, which can be 
prevented by [CONTACT_188952]  (33). 
 
Risks of blood drawing include pain, swelling, bleeding, or bruising at the site where the blood 
sample is collected. Subjects may also experience dizziness or fainting. There is a small risk of infection around the vein where the blood was collected.   Each study subject will be asked to 
have up to 3 blood samplings with the total volume not to exceed 30mL  over approximately 6 
Simultaneous RZV and aIIV4   Version 8.0 
June 20, 2024  
 
  
 
 
35 
 
 
 month period of time  at Duke University, and up to 5 blood samplings with a total volume not to 
exceed 60mL over approximately 6 month period of time at Johns Hopkins University .   
 
As with any licensed vaccine, protection may not occur in 100% of vaccinated persons .  
 
An additional risk of study participation is the potential for loss of confidentiality.  
  
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_223126] Risk 
To decrease the possibility of infection at the site of blood drawing, the area on the arm above 
the vein where blood will be taken will be prepped with 70% isopropyl alcohol antiseptic prior to 
venipuncture.  
Subjects will be counseled on possible side effects following vaccination and followed closely 
during the [ADDRESS_223127] -vaccination for assessment of moderate to severe local or systemic 
reactogenicity. Subjects will be e valuated and cared for as described in the Unscheduled Visit  
section above. All subjects will be monitored in a sitting or lying position for 15  minutes following 
vaccinations to help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Subjects with a prior history 
of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine,  or to a vaccine 
component, including egg protein,  will be excluded from study enrollment.  Data Safety 
monitoring, as described above ( Section 5.4.4  and Appendix G ), shall also be done.  
The study team will provide documentation to the  participant and primary care provider 
regarding  receipt of influenza vaccine without specification of whether it was high dose or 
adjuvanted vaccine to preserve blinding.     
If a participant’s care requires the identity of the vaccine received, blinding will be broken for that patient.  At the end of the study, the participants and providers will receive documentation about 
which vaccine the participant received.  
Every eff ort possible will be made to keep information about participants confidential. 
Computerized participant information will be kept in password- protected files on secured 
servers.  Paper case report forms will be kept in locked files belonging to the study personnel.   
Any publications resulting from this work will not contain any identifiable participant information.

 8.5.1  Vulnerable Subjects Research 
This study proposes to include subjects with mild cognitive impairment .  All potential subjects 
will undergo cognitive assessment to ensure they are capable of providing consent.  Mild 
cognitive impairment is a common age- related condition that is defined by [CONTACT_188954] -term memory impairment that does not interfere the individual’s ability to perform activities 
of daily living or affect other areas of cognition, including judgment and independent decision-
making .  Therefore, persons with mild cognitive impairment have the capacity to make decisions 
about their health care choices, including influenza vaccination, and participation in research 
studies.  Influenza vaccination is recommended for these individuals .  The benefits and burdens 
of the proposed study apply equally  to these individuals as to persons without mild cognitive 
impairment.   
 
Potential participants may have low scores on the cognitive screening tests and be ineligible for 
the study.  In this case,  the study doctor or designee will review the results with the individual 
and recommend follow -up with the individual’s health care provider.

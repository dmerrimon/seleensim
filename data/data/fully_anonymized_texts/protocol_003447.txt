Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the propotiion of patients in each treatment 
group who are considered a Clinical Success at Day 29 ± 2, as defined by [CONTACT_706886] 0 (clear) or I (almost clear) with at least a 2 grades reduction 
from baseline at Day 29 ± 2. That is, at Day 29 ± 2, patients with an JGA 
score of [ADDRESS_960255] shampoo over the Vehicle shampoo at Day 29 ± 2 will 
be tested using a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified 
by [CONTACT_68566], at the 5% significance level. The primary analysis will be 
performed using an imputation method of analysis for missing data in the 
Intent-to- Treat (ITT) population. Patients discontinued because of lack of 
treatment effect will be included in the primary analysis as treatment failures. 
The following two sensitivity analyses will also be performed on the primary 
efficacy endpoint: 
1. Primary analysis will be performed also including patients without an 
assessment at Day 29 ± 2. Patients with missing data at Day 29 ± 2 will 
be considered clinical failures. 
2. Primary analysis will be performed also including patients without an

outcome will be prepared by [CONTACT_1570]. If sufficient data exist, adverse 
event frequencies will be compared between treatments using Fisher's exact

Concomitant medication use during the study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_4676]. 
Signs and symptoms of scalp psoriasis will not be considered adverse events, 
unless in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they have increased in frequency and/or 
severity to such an extent that the Investigator/patient considers that it is in 
the patient's best interest to be dropped from continued participation in the 
study and given alternative therapy for their condition. 
Ocular discomfort, vital signs and skin assessments will be analyzed for both 
treatments. Ocular safety evaluations will be assessed at the discretion of the 
Investigator based on the findings of the HEENT examination performed at 
each visit along with the ocular discomfort symptoms repmted by [CONTACT_102]. 
Ocular discomfort will be assessed by [CONTACT_706887] (Appendix D). 
The primary statistical analysis of interest is a comparison of clinical success, 
as defined by [CONTACT_706888] 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least 2 
grades reduction from baseline at Day 29 ± 2, of the Test treatment, 
desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo, to the clinical success of the respective 
Vehicle shampoo in the ITT population. Based on results fl-om Taro's Phase 
II study [ADDRESS_960258] formulation is expected to 
be approximately 27% for an application duration of 15 minutes. The clinical 
success of the Vehicle formulation is expected to be approximately 10% for 
the same application duration. Based on a two-sided, Yates' continuity­

enrolled ( 185 in the active group and 185 in the placebo group).

7.0 INTRODUCTION 
Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. (Taro) plans to submit an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND) for a new formulation of desoximetasone; desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo. 
This product contains a potent corticosteroid to be indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis 
in patients 12 years of age or older. 
7.1 Disease Being Treated 
Psoriasis is an immune (T-cell)-mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects 
approximately 2% of the western population. The most common type of psoriasis in both 
adults and children is plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by [CONTACT_706889], 
thickened red lesions that are covered by [CONTACT_706890], most commonly seen on 
the knees and/or elbows. Although there are repmis implicating a genetic association 
with the disease, there are also studies that have established a set of psoriasis triggers 
including stress, medications (such as lithium, antimalarials, indomethacin, quinidine, 
beta blockers), injury or infection. The condition is considered chronic although the 
frequency and severity of outbreak in an individual can fluctuate without apparent 
cause.1-[ADDRESS_960262] 50% of all psoriasis cases have scalp psoriasis. Although head represents only 
10% of the whole body surface, the visibility and symptoms of scalp psoriasis can be 
seriously debilitating for many patients, inducing social and emotional distress and 
negatively impacting quality of life.[ADDRESS_960263] extensively studied index 
being the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASl), which is a measure of the average 
redness, thickness, and scaliness of the lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighted by 
[CONTACT_941] % body surface area of involvement. Scalp psoriasis is often assessed using the 
Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) or the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). 
However, the validity and sensitivity of such tools are not well characterized and still 
under investigation. Indicators for the effect of psoriasis on quality oflife and response to 
treatment often influence the overall severity of the disease. lienee, a clinically 
meaningful global assessment by [CONTACT_706891] a 5-point scale is 
considered most appropriate and recommended by [CONTACT_706892].7

historically include topi[INVESTIGATOR_142739], sprays, lotions, foams, and the more recently 
introduced shampoos. Examples of marketed products include corticosteroids (Topi[INVESTIGATOR_706871]@, 
Clobex"'), Vitamin A and D derivatives (Tzorac@, Dovonex@), NSAlDs (salicylic acid), 
etc. For more severe cases, systemic therapy (methotrexate, oral retinoids, UV light, 
biologics, etc) may be warranted; however, the side effect profile ofthese products limits 
their use.1'2'5'8'9 
Desoximetasone is a high potency synthetic COiiicosteroid marketed in a number of 
formulations: gel (0.05%), cream (0.05% and 0.25%), and ointment (0.05% and 0.25%). 
All these formulations are encompassed under the Topi[INVESTIGATOR_706871]@ brand, acquired by [CONTACT_641736] U.S.A., Inc. (Taro) in 2004. Most recently, Taro received approval on

(desoximetasone) Spray, 0.25%, a super high potency formulation that is indicated for the 
treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients 18 years of age or older.10 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_706872], with less than 2% of patients reporting adverse reactions (7% in the pediatric 
population). The most commonly reported adverse events are burning, stinging, pruritus,

Shampoos are considered a preferred treatment option for scalp psoriasis because of ease 
of application and cosmetic acceptability. There are many OTC coal tar shampoos in the 
market for treating mild scalp psoriasis. For the moderate-severe cases, a prescription 
shampoo containing potent corticosteroids is available in the market (Ciobex"' shampoo, 
clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847], 0.05% ). 
A new formulation of desoximetasone -Desoximetasone Shampoo, 0.25% has been 
developed by [CONTACT_706893] U.S.A., Inc. (Taro), and is the Test product used in 
this study. 
7.3 Scientific and Statistical Considerations 
This phase III study (DSXS 1536) has been designed based on review of multiple clinical 
studies in psoriasis, including Taro's phase II dose-ranging study on Desoximetasone 
Shampoo, 0.25% (DSXS 1411)12 and those studies submitted as part of the NDA for 
currently marketed Taclonex@ (betamethasone and calcipotriene) scalp suspension (NDA 
Number: 22-185) 13 and Clobex'" ( clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) shampoo, 0.05% (Gal derma 
Laboratories, NDA Number: 21-644).

(betamethasone and calcipotriene) scalp suspension, [ADDRESS_960264] the patient 
population (patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild to severe plaque psoriasis of the 
scalp) and the definition of Clinical Success (Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of 
disease severity score ofO (clear) or I (almost clear) with at least a 2-grade improvement 
from baseline IGA at the end of the treatment) for this phase III study (DSXS 1536). The 
phase III studies for Clobex'" (clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) shampoo, 0.05% indicated a success

rate of 44% in the active group and approximately 2% in the vehicle group after 4 weeks 
of treatment. 14 
Based on these NDA studies, previous communications with Sponsor, and pre-IND 
discussions regarding this study with the FDA (PI[INVESTIGATOR_47967]# 118881 briefing package and 
FDA letter dated 9118/2013), a 28-day treatment period was considered appropriate to 
determine therapeutic efficacy of the Test shampoo formulation. 
Taro's phase II dose-ranging study on Desoximetasone Shampoo, 0.25% (DSXS 1411) 
was designed to evaluate therapeutic efficacy using multiple application durations of the 
product. The results of this phase II study were used to determine the appropriate 
duration of application (15 minutes) and the expected clinical success rate for subsequent 
phase III efficacy studies. Based on data from this study, a population of [ADDRESS_960265] treatment and up to 185 patients receiving Vehicle 
treatment, for an application time of 15 minutes was considered sufficient to demonstrate 
efficacy, safety and superiority to Placebo for the phase 1II study (DSXS 1536). 
The application time of 15 minutes was also supported based on results from Taro's in­
vitro study that used tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_706873] a shampoo formulation. 15 At 10 minutes following application, 2: 
99% of the applied dose was recovered on the skin surface and no quantifiable amounts 
of desoximetasone were detected in the receptor compartment or inside the skin. 
Therefore, application durations of< 15 minutes will not be used in the Phase 3 studies. 
Application durations of> 15 minutes are expected to reduce the patient's dosing 
compliance and are thus considered impractical for patient's daily routine. 
Desoximetasone is currently marketed by [CONTACT_706894] a gel (0.05%), cream (0.05% and 
0.25%) and ointment (0.05% and 0.25%) indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and 
pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, and as a spray (0.25%) 
indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients [ADDRESS_960266] 
marketed concentration (0.25%) to facilitate convenience by [CONTACT_706895]. 
7.[ADDRESS_960267] is therapeutically superior to a Vehicle formulation that 
contains no active ingredient to treat scalp psoriasis. A sample size of 185 patients is the 
minimum number of patients that can be enrolled into the Vehicle group to ensure high 
statistical power (97% or more) to show a difference at p < 0.05 (two-sided) between the 
active treatment and Vehicle (according to a 1:1, Test: Vehicle randomization scheme).

namely: the disease being treated, the availability, efficacy and safety of already 
approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the scientific and statistical requirements of the desired outcome 
of the research study. The Office of Human Rights Protection (OHRP), a Division of the

occurring during the study are low, the risk is higher in the active treatment group than in 
the Vehicle group. 
All patients enrolled in this study will receive the benefit of fi·ee specialized medical care 
beyond standard medical treatment that would be expected through most health insurance 
plans. In addition, the patient will receive a stipend for participation to cover costs and 
expenses associated with trips to the medical facility. 
8.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of desoximetasone 
0.25% shampoo (Taro Pharmaceuticals, U.S.A., Inc.) compared to a Vehicle shampoo (Taro

Psoriasis 
Patients in each randomized treatment group will apply product once daily, according to 
provided instructions, for a total of28 days starting on Day I. 
During the study patients will visit the clinical center for a total of 3 scheduled visits: 
• Visit 1 (Day -1 to 1): Randomization 
• Visit 2 (Day 14 ± 2): Interim Visit 
• Visit 3 (Day 29 ± 2): End of Study or Early Termination 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group who 
are considered a Clinical Success, as defined by [CONTACT_706888] 0 (clear) or 1 (almost 
clear) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline IGA at Day 29 ± 2. That is, at 
Day 29 ± 2, patients with an IGA score of [ADDRESS_960273] achieve a score of 0 to be considered a 
Clinical Success. The 5-point IGA score represents an overall severity of scalp psoriasis 
based on plaque elevation, scaling and erythema. Severity represented by a score of 0-4 is 
categorized as 'clear', 'minimal', 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'. Refer to Appendix A for 
IGA scoring. 
The safety profile of each treatment group will be evaluated by [CONTACT_706896], dermal and ocular discomfmt and vital signs obtained through the study duration. 
Ethical consideration related to this protocol and the use of human patients will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_2717]. 
9.2 Selection of Study Design 
This phase III study has been designed based on review of multiple clinical studies in 
psoriasis, including Taro's phase II dose-ranging study on Desoximetasone Shampoo, 
0.25% (DSXS 1411)12 and those studies submitted as a part of the NDA for currently 
marketed Taclonex® (betamethasone and calcipotriene) scalp suspension (NDA Number: 
22-185) and Clobex® clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_706874], 0.05% (NDA Number: 21-644), 13• 14 
and results of Taro's in-vitro study that used tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_706875] a shampoo formulation.15 Based on 
these studies, previous communications with Sponsor, and pre-IND discussions with the 
FDA (PI[INVESTIGATOR_47967]# 118881 ), a daily application of shampoo for 15 minutes for a 28-day 
treatment duration and a population of 370 patients (185 patients receiving active 
treatment and 185 patients receiving vehicle treatment) was considered appropriate to 
demonstrate therapeutic efficacy and safety of desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo (Taro) 
compared to a Vehicle shampoo.

9.7 Adverse Events 
The patients will be monitored throughout the study for any Adverse Events. AEs will be 
collected through both solicited and unsolicited means and subsequently coded in tabular 
form using the MedORA (Version 18.1 or higher) Adverse Event Dictionary. The patients 
will be encouraged to report signs, symptoms, and any changes in health to the clinic staff. 
Severity of each AE will be determined by [CONTACT_706908]. The Investigator will judge the relationship of the event to the study 
treatments. Adverse events should be followed up until they have resolved or stabilized. In 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], if the patient suffers an AE that warrants discontinuation of 
the study drug due to interference with age-appropriate instrumental ADL (Activities of 
Daily Living), for example preparing for meal, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706880], using the 
telephone, etc. the patient will be followed until the AE resolves or is considered stable. 
Any subject that discontinues the study because of an adverse event will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
9.7.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse Event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to 
this product. This includes events not seen at baseline, or worsened even if 
present at baseline. 
Unexpected Adverse Event: An adverse event where the nature or severity of is 
not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's 
Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package inse1i/summary 
of product characteristics for an approved product). 
Adverse Drug Reaction: All noxious and unintended responses to a medical 
product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The 
response to a 'medical product' means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., 
the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
9.7.2 Severity of Adverse Event 
The severity of the adverse event will be graded by [CONTACT_706909]: 
• MILD: Awareness of symptom but does not interfere with routine 
activities. 
• MODERATE: Discomfort sufficient to interfere with routine activities. 
• SEVERE: Impossible to perform routine activities.

9.7.[ADDRESS_960291] 
• NOT RELATED: Any AE that is clearly not related to use of the study 
drug. 
• POSSIBLE: The association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; 
however, a relationship between the drug and event cannot be ruled out. 
• PROBABLE: There is reasonable temporal relationship between the use 
of the study drug and the AE. Based upon the Investigator's clinical 
experience, the association of the event with the study drug seems likely. 
• DEFINITE: The AE occurs following the application of the study drug 
and it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_706910]'s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of treatment administered to the patient. It disappears or decreases 
upon discontinuation of the study product and reappears on a re­
challenge of the study drug. 
9.7.4 Patient's Participation Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706881], if the patient suffers an AE that warrants 
discontinuation of the study drug because of interference with age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL (Activities of Daily Living), for example preparing for meal, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706880], using the telephone, etc. the patient will be 
followed until the AE resolves or is considered stable. Any subject that 
discontinues the study because of an adverse event will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
9.8 Serious Adverse Events 
9.8.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose suggests a medically significant hazard, including any event that: 
• Results in death -includes all deaths, even those that appear to be 
completely unrelated to study treatment (e.g., car accident where patient 
is a passenger). 
• Is life-threatening -in the view of the Investigator, the patient is at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (substantial 
disruption of one· s ability to conduct normal life). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929].

• Causes congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life­
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an 
emergency room, convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). 
Emergency Room visits that require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above are considered a 
Serious Adverse Event.

Investigators will be informed of any SAEs reported at other study sites within 
15 days from the initial report. 
10.0 STATISTICAL METHODS 
10.1 Statistical Plan 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), detailing the intended statistical analysis of the study 
data, will be prepared as a separate document and finalized before database lock. Any 
deviation from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the final 
report, as appropriate. The procedure for accounting for missing, unused and spurious 
data will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
All statistical analysis will be conducted using SAS®, Version 9.[ADDRESS_960293] is a comparison of clinical success, as defined 
by [CONTACT_706888] 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with at least 2 grades reduction from 
baseline at Day 29 ± 2, of the Test treatment, desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo, to the 
clinical success of the respective Vehicle shampoo in the ITT population. Based on 
results from Taro's Phase II study 71515008, the clinical success ofthe Test formulation 
is expected to be approximately 27% for an application duration of 15 minutes. The 
clinical success of the Vehicle formulation is expected to be approximately 10% for the 
same application duration. Based on a two-sided, Yates' continuity-corrected Z-test and a 
pooled response rate for the standard error of the difference in propmiions, [ADDRESS_960294] 97% power to demonstrate superiority at the 5% significance level (p < 
0.05) for the active treatment over placebo. To allow for about 10% of patients who may 
drop out from the study or are otherwise non-evaluable, up to 370 patients may be 
enrolled (I 85 in the active group and 185 in the placebo group). 
10.3 Study Populations 
1 0.3.1 Intent-to- Treat (ITT) Population 
The ITT population will include: 
• All randomized subjects. 
10.3.2 Safety Population 
• All patients who were randomized and applied at least one dose of the study 
product.

Psoriasis 
10.4 Baseline Comparability 
Baseline comparability of each treatment group will be evaluated separately in the ITT 
and Safety populations. Comparative analyses will use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., 
one-way analysis of variance, Cochran-Mantei-Haenszel test). 
The following baseline demographics (determined from their initial study visit) will be 
evaluated: 
• Age (years) 
• Gender (male/female) 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic/non Hispanic) 
• Race (White, Black/African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Other) 
• %Scalp affected 
• Number of months and/or years patient has suffered from symptoms caused by 
[CONTACT_706911]. 
10.5 Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the propotiion of patients in each treatment group who 
are considered a Clinical Success at Day 29 ± 2, as defined by [CONTACT_706888] 0 (clear) 
or 1 (almost clear) with at least a 2 grades reduction from baseline at Day 29 ± 2. That is, 
at Day 29 ± 2, patients with an IGA score of [ADDRESS_960295] shampoo over the Vehicle shampoo at Day 29 ± 2 will be 
tested using a two-sided Cochran-Mantei-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by 
[CONTACT_68566], at the 5% significance level. The primary analysis will be performed 
using an imputation method of analysis for missing data in the Intent-to-Treat 
(ITT) population. Details of the imputation method will be delineated in the SAP. 
Patients discontinued because of lack of treatment effect will be included in the 
primary analysis as treatment failures. 
10.6.2 Sensitivity Analyses 
The following two sensitivity analyses will also be performed on the primary 
efficacy endpoint:

data exist, adverse event frequencies will be compared between treatments using Fisher's 
exact test or a similar test. 
Concomitant medication use during the study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_4676]. 
Signs and symptoms of scalp psoriasis wiii not be considered adverse events, unless in 
the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they have increased in fi·equency and/or severity to such an 
extent that the Investigator/patient considers that it is in the patient's best interest to be 
dropped from continued participation in the study and given alternative therapy for their 
condition. 
Ocular discomfort, vital signs and skin assessments wiii be analyzed for both treatments. 
Ocular safety evaluations will be assessed at the discretion of the Investigator based on 
the findings of the HEENT examination performed at each visit along with the ocular 
discomfot1 symptoms reported by [CONTACT_102]. Ocular discomfort will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_706912] (Appendix D).

13.2 APPENDIX B 
Skin Assessment (Forehead, Neck and Ears) 
At each clinic visit, the Investigator will evaluate the scalp and the adjacent skin (head, 
neck and ears) for irritation using the following scale: 
Dermal Response and Other Effects Scoring 
Dermal Response 
0 = no evidence of irritation 
1 =minimal erythema, barely perceptible 
2 =definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response 
3 = erythema and papules 
4 = definite edema 
5 = erythema, edema, and papules 
6 =vesicular eruption 
7 =strong reaction spreading beyond the application site 
Other Effects 
N =No other observations (numerical score= 0) 
A= Slightly glazed appearance (numerical score= 0) 
B =Marked glazed appearance (numerical score= I) 
C =Glazing with peeling and cracking (numerical score= 2) 
F =Glazing with fissures (numerical score= 3) 
G = Film of dried serous exudates covering all or pmi of the application site (numerical 
score= 3) 
H =Small petechial erosions and/or scabs (numerical score= 3)

randomized forehead, cheek, and jawline). 
 

CONFIDENTIAL  DCS-94-[ADDRESS_1243026] number/initials, and the initials and date of the person 
dispensing and receiving the returned study products will be documented on this 
form.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1243027] medical occurrence (sign, 
symptom or laboratory finding), regardless of severity and whether or not 
attributed to the study product. 
 
The investigator/coordinator will report all adverse experiences (AEs) that occur 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be recorded in the appropriate AE log.  The 
report will include: date of onset, a description of the AE, severity, seriousness, 
action taken, relationship to the study drug, outcome of the event, and date of 
resolution. 
 
11.2.1 ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY 
The intensity or severity of an AE is characterized as: 
Mild: AE which is easily tolerated. Moderate: AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity. 
Severe: AE which prevents normal daily activities. 

CONFIDENTIAL  DCS-94-[ADDRESS_1243028] 
The relationship is characterized as: 
Not Related - applies to any adverse experience that is clearly not related to use of the study product. 
Possible - means the association of the adverse experience with the study 
product is unknown; however, a relationship between study product and 
experience cannot be ruled out.   
Probable - there is a reasonable temporal relationship between the use of the study product and the adverse experience.  Based upon the investigator’s 
clinical experience, the association of the event with the study product seems 
likely. 
Definite - The AE occurs following the application of the study product and it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_888254]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the subject.  It disappears or decreases upon 
discontinuation of the study product and reappears on a re-challenge of the 
study product.  This is necessary to evaluate allergic or irritant contact 
[CONTACT_8748]. 
11.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Definition:  An SAE is defined as any adverse experience occurring that results 
in any of the following outcomes:   
 
1. death  
2. immediately life-threatening illness
3. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( > 24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
4. a persistent or significant disability 
5. a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
6. “other” important medical event  
 
These are not anticipated, however, should an SAE occur, the primary 
investigator (Zoe Diana Draelos, MD) will accept responsibility to notify the 
sponsor. 
 
12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
Along with descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations and percentages), 
investigator and subject ordinal nonparametric results will be analyzed using 
Wilcoxon signed rank test and sign test for paired comparison at different time 
points.  The noninvasive parametric results will be analyzed using paired t-test. 
Changes will be considered significant at the alpha level of 0.05.

all subject results will be identified only by a subject identification number.  
However, in compliance with federal guidelines regarding the monitoring of 
clinical studies and in fulfillment of his/her obligations to the Sponsor, it is 
required that the Investigator permit the study monitor and/or FDA representative 
to review that portion of the subject’s medical record that is directly related to the 
study.  This shall include all study relevant documentation including subject 
medical histories to verify eligibility, laboratory test result reports to verify 
transcription accuracy, admission/discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888246], and autopsy reports for 
deaths occurring during the study. 
 
As part of the required content of informed consent, the subject must be informed 
that his/her medical chart may be reviewed by [CONTACT_456], the Sponsor’s 
authorized representative, or a representative of the FDA.  Should access to the 
medical record require a separate waiver or authorization, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to obtain such permission from the subject in writing before the 
subject is entered into the study.

each phase during the course of the study.  Subjects are not to be identified on 
CRFs by [CONTACT_2300]; appropriately coded identification and the subject’s initials 
must be used.  The investigator must keep a separate log of the subject’s 
names and addresses. 
 
The research site will maintain the following documents:

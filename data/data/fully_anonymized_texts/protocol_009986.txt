2PRECIS 
Background: 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) is a pyrimidine-based multi-kinase inhibitor that has been shown to 
have inhibitory effects on CDKs, Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) and Fm-like tyrosine kinase 3 
(Flt3). It is orally administered and penetrates blood brain barrier (BBB). There is clinical 
experience in using Zotiraciclib (TG02) as both a single agent and in combination with 
other chemotherapy agents for cancer treatment. 
Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that has proven efficacy in anaplastic 
glioma and glioblastoma. It was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to treat anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma in adults. Both a dose-dense (dd) 
schedule, 7 days on and 7 days off and a metronomic (mn) daily dosing schedule have 
been used to treat recurrent high-grade gliomas.
Our preclinical data have demonstrated that Zotiraciclib (TG02) down-regulates CDK9 
activity and its target proteins, such as anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, XIAP and survivin. 
A treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) and TMZ has synergistic anti-glioma effects in a 
variety of glioma models with different genetic background. This serves as the basis for 
this proposed clinical trial. 
Objectives:
Phase I:
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ 
using both the dd and mn TMZ schedules in adult patients with recurrent anaplastic 
astrocytoma or glioblastoma/gliosarcoma.
Phase II:
To determine the efficacy of Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ versus TMZ alone in patients 
with recurrent WHO grade III or IV astrocytoma as determined by [CONTACT_300847].
Eligibility:
Documented pathology diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma [WHO grade III], or 
glioblastoma/gliosarcoma [WHO grade IV] with recurrent disease. If the pathology 
diagnosis is anaplastic glioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, evidence of either intact 
1p/19q chromosomes or molecular features suggesting astrocytic tumor must be present. 
(including, but not limited to ATRX and/or TP53 mutation)
No prior use of bevacizumab as a treatment for brain tumor. 
No more than two prior relapses for Phase I and no more than one prior relapse for Phase 
II.
Patients must have recurrent disease, either histologically proven or with imaging 
suggestive of recurrent disease 
Tumor tissues available for review to confirm the histologic diagnosis.
Tumor tissue blocks available for molecular profiling analysis.

3Design:
Phase I: 
This portion of the study is conducted in two stages: The MTD finding and cohort 
extension.  Two treatment arms and several dose levels are planned. 
In the MTD finding part, TMZ with two alternate schedules (dd and mn) in combination 
with Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be administered. 
A cohort extension of both arms will be performed at each MTD and the treatment arm 
with a better progression free survival at 4 months (PFS4) will be selected for the 
combination treatment arm for Phase II.
Pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic studies and neutrophil analysis will be performed 
during the cohort extension of both arms. 
A maximum of 72 patients will be enrolled to this component for the trial.
Phase II:
Patients will be randomized between two competing treatment arms: (“winner” of dd vs 
mn) TMZ + Zotiraciclib (TG02) versus dd/mn TMZ alone using a Bayesian clinical trial 
design. The dosage for the combination arm will be derived from the MTD determined in 
the Phase I component of the study. 
The treatment schedule will be identical to that described above in the phase I 
component, with each cycle comprising 28 days. 
Patients will continue treatment until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
At progression, patients randomized to the control arm (Temozolomide [TMZ] alone) 
will be offered the opportunity to continue TMZ and additional treatment with 
Zotiraciclib (TG02).

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.2.1 Disease background
High grade astrocytomas include glioblastoma (GBM) [WHO grade IV] and anaplastic 
astrocytoma (AA), [WHO grade III]. Both are highly malignant and belong to gliomas. Gliomas 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
8represent 80% of malignant CNS tumors. GBM accounts for 54% of gliomas and AA accounts 
for 7%.[ 1] 
Histologically, GBM displays a high mitotic index, cellular pleomorphism, and extensive 
vascular proliferation or necrosis. They are characterized by [CONTACT_345032], high 
morbidity and mortality. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_345002], 
radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the prognosis of patients with GBM remains 
poor with a median survival rate of less than 18 months.[ 2] Recurrent GBM has an even more 
dismal prognosis with a median overall survival of approximately 25 weeks. [ 3]  
Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) is classified by [CONTACT_155853] a grade III glioma, demonstrating a less 
aggressive behavior when comparing to GBM. AA frequently transforms to GBM. The treatment 
of recurrent AA is unsatisfying.  Chemotherapy and re-operation for recurrent AA is of modest 
benefit and only bring short responses. Wong et al reported that a progression free survival rate 
at 6 months is 31% and the median progression free survival is only 13 weeks based on eight 
phase II clinical trials that included 150 patients with recurrent AA.[ 3] In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_345003] 1999 for TMZ as the treatment of recurrent AA, the 
PFS6 and median overall survival were reported as 46% and 13.6 months respectively.[ 4]
Most normal cells can activate the apoptotic pathways in response to DNA damage or abnormal 
proliferation. In contrast, tumor cells in AA developed mechanisms to increase cell proliferation 
and decreasing apoptosis. TP53 is one of the notably known genes that are implicated in 
apoptotic pathways of high grade astrocytoma.  The TP53 gene that maps to chromosome 17p is 
frequently inactivated in astrocytoma  and is found in one third of AAs.[ 5] P53 protein plays 
multiple important roles in a number of cellular processes including cell cycle arrest, response to 
DNA damage and apoptosis. As expected, the signaling pathways in gliomas including TP53 
inactivation are most commonly noted in secondary GBM, which evolves from AA, in contrast 
to the primary glioblastoma, which are featured by [INVESTIGATOR_235956], including EGFR 
amplification and chromosome 10 loss with PTEN mutation.[ 6, 7] 
1.2.2 Zotiraciclib (TG02) in human cancers
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanisms of action of Zotiraciclib (TG02)
Zotiraciclib (TG02) is a pyrimidine-based multi-kinase inhibitor that has been shown to have 
inhibitory effects on cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Fm-like 
tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3).[ 8] It most potently inhibits CDK1, 2, 3, [ADDRESS_428532] Flt3 and its 
drug resistant mutant with an IC 50 of 19-21 nM.

9Figure 1:  Target kinase inhibition by [CONTACT_345033] (TG02) following oral dosing at 60mg/kg in 
nude mice bearing MCV-[ADDRESS_428533] appealing features of 
Zotiraciclib (TG02). CDK9 is a serine/threonine kinase that forms the catalytic core of the 
positive transcription elongation factor [ 9-11] and it is critical for stimulating transcription 
elongation through RNA polymerase II.[ 12]  To assess target engagement by [CONTACT_345033] (TG02) 
in tumor tissues, tumor lysate were analyzed after dosing MV4-11 AML xenograft-bearing mice 
with a single dose of 60mg/kg Zotiraciclib (TG02). Level of RNA-polymerase II 
phosphorylation at serine 2 was used as a readout for CDK9 inhibition. The inhibition was 
observed starting from 0.5 hours and reached to a maximum at 6 hours as demonstrated in Figure 
1 (Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6).  As a consequence of inhibiting CDK9 function, the 
short-lived proteins will be depleted due to their heightened requirement to be regularly 
refreshed.[ 13] Two such short-lived proteins that play an important role in cancer cell survival 
mechanisms are Myeloid Leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), a B-cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family member and 
x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), an anti-apoptotic protein.[ 14] Both Mcl-1 and XIAP were 
found to be depleted following a treatment with TG02 in hematologic malignancy cell lines, 
including myeloma cell line, as demonstrated in Figure 2 (Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6). 
Figure 2:  Zotiraciclib (TG02) depletes anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 and AP families in 
myeloma cell line.

Version Date: 06/01/2020
10Since it was discovered in 1992, Mcl-1 has been shown to play an integral role in anti-apoptotic 
signaling pathways. Mcl-1 is highly expressed in a variety of human cancer cells, including CNS 
cancers. [ 15] Its overexpression is one of the survival mechanisms that allow cancer cells to 
survive and to further develop resistance to various apoptotic-inducing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. To underscore 
this point, in high grade gliomas, Mcl-1 was found to be the dominant anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-
related protein.[ 16]
XIAP expression has been noted in human glioma cell lines and apoptosis was blocked after 
XIAP gene transfer,[ 17] suggesting that XIAP is involved in apoptosis signaling in human 
gliomas.
CDK9 activity is regulated though activators, such as c-Myc [ 18] and NFkB [ 19], both are 
heavily involved in pathogenesis of malignant glioma.[ 20, 21]  In addition to their roles in 
transcription, CDKs can regulate other cellular process that were considered as the core function 
of cell cycle control mechanisms.[ 22] While not involved in cell cycle progression, CDK9 and 
its cyclin partner T1 have a role in cell differentiation.[ 23] CDK9 was also found to be crucial in 
MYC-driven tumors. Pharmacological or shRNA-mediated CDK9 inhibition led to anti-tumor 
effects that correlated with MYC expression level, suggesting CDK9 inhibition likely is a 
therapeutic approach for treating MYC-overexpression tumors.[ 24]
In vitro studies have demonstrated that Zotiraciclib (TG02) depletes survival proteins, including 
Mcl-1 and XIAP, leading to apoptosis in human tumor cells.[ 25] An oral dosing at 30-60mg/kg 
of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in mice AML xenografts demonstrated an inhibition of several target 
kinases, suggesting that the agent inhibited CDK9, CDK2, JAK2 and FLT3.[ 8]
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical and clinical experience of Zotiraciclib (TG02)
Preclinical experiences
Extensive preclinical experiments have been performed to demonstrate the characteristics of 
Zotiraciclib (TG02). A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) safety pharmacology study was 
conducted in 12 beagle dogs (6 females and 6 male) to evaluate the cardiovascular and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_345004] (TG02) after a single oral administration at 30mg/kg and 60 
mg/kg. A dose-related duration of emesis was observed. One female dog received Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) at 30mg/kg died due to circulatory failure secondary to diarrhea and dehydration caused 
by [CONTACT_345034]. Postmortem pathology exam demonstrated marked atrophy and 
hemorrhage of thymus in this individual dog. The surface of both small and large intestines was 
found to be covered by [CONTACT_345035]. The histologic exam showed epi[INVESTIGATOR_345005]. All the 
other 11 dogs survived, and no changes were noted in skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], circulatory system, autonomic system and CNS. There were no Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) effects on cardiac function in dogs. The individual values for blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], body temperature and glucose levels were within physiological limits during the study in all 
groups.   Neither dose- nor sex-dependent variations were observed. Serum chemistry 
examination performed during the study showed dose dependent escalation in LDH, AST, ALT 
and CK in interval 2 hours and 6 hours after the administration of Zotiraciclib (TG02) with a 
trend to recovery of LDH and AST at 24 and 48 hours after Zotiraciclib (TG02) treatment.

11Table 1: Pharmacokinetic parameters of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in mice, rats and dogs
Pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses were conducted in female nude mice, male Wistar rats and male 
beagle dogs. Comparison of single intravenous (I.V.) and oral doses showed variable 
bioavailability following oral dosing. All three species showed a rapid absorption following oral 
dosing with T max ranging from 10 minutes to 60 minutes. The PK parameters of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) in these 3 species are summarized in Table 1 (Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6). The 
plasma concentration versus time profile of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in female nude mice following a 
single dose of 5mg/kg intravenously and a single oral dose of 75mg/kg is demonstrated in Figure 
3 (Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6).

12Figure 3: Plasma concentrations vs. time profile of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in female nude mice 
following a single IV dose of 5mg/kg and a single oral dose of 75 mg/kg (n=3)
The PK assessment following a single oral administration under fed and in unfed conditions in 
mice suggested no significant food-drug interaction. The percentage of plasma protein biding of 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) was measured by [CONTACT_345036] (TG02) (1000ng/ml) 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_345006], dog, and mouse plasma against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37oC for 
4 hours. Results suggested that the percentage of plasma-bound Zotiraciclib (TG02) was 99.97% 
±  in human and similar in all species studied. Limited tissue distribution of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) was assessed in female nude mice following a single oral dosing at 75mg/kg. The mean 
concentration of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in plasma and tissues were demonstrated in Figure 4 
(Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6).

time points following a single oral administration of 75mg/kg to nude mice (n=3)

mg/kg and 60mg/kg in Nude Mice Bearing MV4-11 AML Xenografts
Zotiraciclib (TG02) preferentially distributed to liver, lungs and kidney followed by [CONTACT_345037].  The PK of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in plasma and tumor tissues in mice was also determined 
following a signal dosing of nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of FLT-mutant AML 
MV4-11 at 30mg/kg and 60mg/kg. The PK parameters that are summarized in Table 2 
(Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6) suggested that the greater peak and aggregate drug exposure 
in the tumor than in the blood in this animal model. The tissue distribution after single dose of 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) in mice demonstrate that the AUC ratio of brain/plasma is 2.4, suggesting 
good blood brain barrier penetration, which is highly relevant to the potential use of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) in brain tumor treatment ( Table 3, data from Adastra Pharmaceutical). Figure 5 
(Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6) shows the mean plasma and tissue concentration profiles 
over time. The levels of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in plasma and tissue exceeded the biochemical IC 50 
on the kinases CDK1, 2, and 9 (<10 nM) and FLT3 and JAK2 (20 nM to 40 nM); and exceeded 
the cellular IC 50 on primary AML blasts (40nM to 50nM) for at least 24 hours at both doses. In

concentrations peaked at 200-fold above these levels (~8 μM) and remained 10-fold over (~0.4 
μM) after [ADDRESS_428534], Zotiraciclib (TG02) was cleared relatively rapi[INVESTIGATOR_290495], 
with blood levels droppi[INVESTIGATOR_345007] 3 to 4 hours after a 
30mg/kg dose and 13 to 14 hours after a 60 mg/kg dose.

The in vitro metabolic T 1/2 of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in human liver microsomes (LM; T 1/2 = 48 
minutes), indicates involvement of Phase 1 metabolism. Species differences for in vitro 
metabolic T 1/2 were noted as demonstrated in Figure 6 (Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6). The 
compound appears to be more stable in human and dog than in mouse and rat LMs. The major 
metabolites observed in all species were M1, N-de-methylation, and M2, resulting from 
oxidation of Zotiraciclib (TG02).

15Figure 6: In-vitro Microsomal Stability of Zotiraciclib (TG02) In Liver Microsomes
To investigate the role of CYP450 isozymes in the metabolism of Zotiraciclib (TG02), CYP3A4, 
2D6, 1A2, 2C9, and 2C19 Bactosomes (recombinant isoform expression systems) were 
incubated with 5 μM Zotiraciclib (TG02) at 37°C for 45 minutes in the presence of nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase. In this assay system, the t1/2 of Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
was approximately 30 minutes for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Bactosomes but >45 minutes for the 
other isoforms. These results indicate that Zotiraciclib (TG02) is primarily metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP3A4. The potential for Zotiraciclib (TG02) to inhibit CYP450 isozymes was 
assessed using pooled human LM. The capacity of Zotiraciclib (TG02) (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 2.5, 5, 
and 25 μM) to inhibit various CYP450 isozymes was investigated by [CONTACT_345038] (IC50 and inhibition constant [Ki]) on prototype reactions using specific substrates. 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) inhibited the catalytic activity of CYP2D6 (IC50 = 0.95 μM ± 0.16 μM), but 
not the other isozymes tested. The potential of Zotiraciclib (TG02) to induce human CYP3A4 
and CYP1A2 isozymes was investigated in cultured human hepatocytes from a single male 
human donor. Results suggested that Zotiraciclib (TG02) is a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in 
human hepatocytes when compared with positive control omeprazole. For CYP3A4, Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) caused no significant induction at the concentration range tested.  Trans-epi[INVESTIGATOR_345008] (TG02) through Caco-2 monolayers in comparison with 2 control 
compounds indicates that Zotiraciclib (TG02) has high intestinal absorption. The efflux ratio 
value (~1) for Zotiraciclib (TG02) suggests no involvement of an active P-glycoprotein mediated 
transport mechanism. 
The toxicological profile of Zotiraciclib (TG02) was evaluated in mice and dogs following single 
and multiple oral doses for up to 28 days followed by a 28-day non-treatment recovery period. 
Genotoxicity (Ames test, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus 
test) was also conducted to provide an overall assessment of Zotiraciclib (TG02). The mean 
toxicokinetic parameters for Zotiraciclib (TG02) following a single oral administration to mice is 
summarized in Table 4 (Investigator’s Brochure, Version 6) and those following 28 days of daily 
oral administration is summarized in Table 5 (Investigator’s Brochure, version 6).

Administration to Mice

Administration to Mice.
In the GLP acute oral toxicity study in mice, groups of 10 mice/sex were administered 0 
(vehicle), 25 mg/kg, 50 m/kg, or 100 mg/kg Zotiraciclib (TG02). Cohorts of mice were 
humanely terminated on Days 3 and 15 and given a full postmortem evaluation. In addition, a 
subgroup of mice was designated for neurobehavioral assessment through the use of a functional 
observational battery (FOB), and another subgroup of mice was designated for a full TK profile 
on Day 1. All animals survived until scheduled termination. Rough coat was observed on Day 3 
in two males received 100 mg/kg and one male received 50 mg/kg. Body weight decreases were 
observed in the males and females in 100 mg/kg group on Days [ADDRESS_428535] article administration. The FOB suggests that a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg 
or 100 mg/kg Zotiraciclib (TG02) may induce acute increases in aggression and/or emotionality, 
consistent with minor increases in specific measures of spontaneous locomotor activity (e.g., 
rearing). Test article-related hematology changes included decreased reticulocytes on Day 3 in 
the 25 mg/kg males, and in both sexes of the 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg groups, which correlated 
with bone marrow atrophy/necrosis. Total WBC and differential WBC counts decreased in the 
50 mg/kg males only and in both sexes of the 100 mg/kg groups. These were the result of test

17article administration and were consistent with thymic atrophy observed in the 100 mg/kg 
animals. Test article-related increases in platelet counts were noted in the 100 mg/kg females. 
There were no obvious changes in the serum chemistry parameters for any of the groups 
attributed to Zotiraciclib (TG02) citrate. Histopathologic changes due to Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
citrate were observed in the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow of mice examined on Day 3, and 
in the spleen of mice examined on Day 15. Zotiraciclib (TG02)-related atrophy was present in 
the thymus of all 100mg/kg mice examined at Day 3. Due to the thymic atrophy on Day 3, 
thymic weight parameters were reduced in both sexes of the 100 mg/kg group and in the 50 
mg/kg males. Thymic atrophy was not evident in recovery mice examined on Day 15. Bone 
marrow atrophy and/or necrosis were present on Day [ADDRESS_428536] 100 mg/kg mice and in some 25 
mg/kg and 50 mg/kg females and one (1) 50 mg/kg male. Bone marrow atrophy was not evident 
in recovery mice examined on Day 15. Hematopoiesis was reduced in the spleen of 100 mg/kg 
and 50 mg/kg mice and occasional 25 mg/kg females examined on Day 3 and was responsible 
for reduced splenic weight parameters in the 100 mg/kg males. Splenic hematopoiesis was not 
apparent in recovery group mice examined on Day 15. Based on the results of the single-dose 
study of Zotiraciclib (TG02) citrate in mice, a no observed adverse effect level was not 
determined. Test article-related findings on Day 3 included rough coat (50 mg/kg and 100 
mg/kg); body weight decreases (100 mg/kg); decreased reticulocytes (25 mg/kg [males only], 50 
mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg); decreased WBC counts (50 mg/kg [males only] and 100 mg/kg); 
increased platelet counts (100 mg/kg [females only]); and thymic, spleen, and bone marrow 
changes in organ weights and histopathology (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg). By [CONTACT_2006] 15, recovery was 
evident or complete for each of the parameters affected. 
Multiple dose toxicity was evaluated by a GLP oral 28-day toxicity study was conducted in CD-
1 mice to determine potential toxicity and TK of Zotiraciclib (TG02) citrate when administered 
by a daily oral gavage for up to 28 consecutive days and to monitor the persistence or 
reversibility of any adverse effects after a 28-day recovery period. Ten mice/sex/group were 
assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups at target dosage levels of 0 (control article), 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 
and 40 mg/kg Zotiraciclib (TG02). Endpoints used to evaluate the potential toxicity of 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) citrate were survival, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, 
clinical pathology, necropsy, organ weights, and selected histopathology. Mice administered 10 
mg/kg/day Zotiraciclib (TG02) did not display any adverse clinical signs or statistically 
significant differences in mean body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology or organ 
weight values when compared to respective control values. Preliminary data revealed significant 
decreases in mean body weight and food consumption values in the 40 mg/kg males and females 
with a noted decrease in survival in this group. Based on the inability to field recovery animals at 
40 mg/kg (exceeded the MTD), animals within the core and recovery groups were reassigned so 
that recovery could also be assessed at the mid-dose level, 20 mg/kg. Mice administered 40 
mg/kg displayed adverse clinical observations suggestive of a general debilitation in their health 
status; whereas only rough hair coat was noted in some mice administered 20 mg/kg. 
Administration of 40 mg/kg Zotiraciclib (TG02) was related to decreases in reticulocyte counts, 
red blood cell (RBC) counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in males and females, and decreases in 
total WBC, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts in the males on Day 29. Mice 
administered 20 mg/kg Zotiraciclib (TG02) displayed decreases in total WBC, lymphocyte, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
18neutrophil, and monocyte counts on Day 29. On Day 57, the hematology results of the 20 mg/kg 
mice of both sexes and the 40 mg/kg females were similar to controls. 
Test article-related clinical chemistry changes on Day 29 in the 40 mg/kg group included 
increases in ALT, AST, CK, and LDH (males and females); increases in alkaline phosphate, 
BUN, sodium and chloride (males), and decreases in total bilirubin, total protein and ALB 
(males and females); decreases in serum cholesterol and blood glucose (males); and decreases in 
serum globulin and increases in the mean ALB/globulin ratio in the 40 mg/kg females. 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) related clinical chemistry changes on Day 29 in the 20 mg/kg males included 
increases in AST, LDH, BUN, and triglycerides and decreases in bilirubin; and in the females 
there were decreases in globulin and increases in the ALB/globulin ratio and BUN value. 
Zotiraciclib (TG02)-related changes were present in the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, stomach, 
liver, testes, uterus, and/or small intestines of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg scheduled 
termination mice, and consisted of atrophy and or necrosis of lymphoid tissues, reduced or 
increased hematopoiesis in the spleen, atrophy of bone marrow elements, testicular degeneration, 
small uterus, and atrophy and necrosis and/or regeneration (increased mitoses) of enterocytes in 
the small intestines. Zotiraciclib (TG02)-related lesions were reversed at recovery (Day 57) 
except in the GI tract, where minimal residual lesions were present in the small intestine and 
lesions were mildly increased in the forestomach. Additionally, testicular degeneration was still 
present in the 20 mg/kg mice at recovery. 
In the confirmatory mutagenicity assay, no positive mutagenic response was observed. 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) citrate was evaluated for its genotoxic potential (clastogenicity/aneugenicity) 
as measured by [CONTACT_345039] 
(MPCEs) in bone marrow of male and female mice. A significant increase in the incidence of 
MPCEs in bone marrow of male and female ICR mice received 100mg/kg Zotiraciclib (TG02), 
indicating the positivity in mouse micronucleus assay.
Clinical experiences
Two Phase 1 clinical studies with single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) in hematological malignancy 
have been conducted ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The primary objective of these 
studies was to determine the MTD and DLT. Phase 1 study in combination with carfilzomib in 
multiple myeloma is ongoing. Additional study with Zotiraciclib (TG02) in combination with a 
hypomethylating agent is under development.

The interim analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data from clinical studies has been evaluated for 
55 acute leukemia patients, 18 multiple myeloma patients and 8 CLL patients. Mean exposures 
for Zotiraciclib (TG02) over twenty-four hours from Cycle 1 Day 1 ( Figure 7) reveal dose-
dependent increases in exposure (AUC0-t), C max at approximately 2 hours and an estimated t 1/[ADDRESS_428537] frequently around C max on 
dosing days.

20Table 6: Summary of Zotiraciclib (TG02) Clinical Studies
Multiple consecutive daily doses resulted in Zotiraciclib (TG02) drug accumulation that was not 
predicted based on the nonclinical toxicokinetic studies. Drug accumulation was associated with 
higher incidence and frequency of exposure-related TEAEs, such as fatigue. Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
was administered three times per week (TIW) to multiple myeloma patients; TIW dosing 
reduced but did not alleviate drug accumulation. BIW dosing, twice per week, alleviated drug 
accumulation in all populations and reduced the incidence and severity of drug-related fatigue. 
Schedules of Zotiraciclib (TG02) clinical studies are summarized in Table 6 (Investigator’s 
Brochure, Version 6). The preclinical pharmacodynamics data demonstrate that daily 
administration is not required to achieve anticipated therapeutic drug levels. Base on PK profiles, 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be administered no more than twice weekly (BIW). 
In a Phase 1 study of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in multiple myeloma patients, a single agent Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) was administered to 18 multiple myeloma patients on three different schedules of a 28-day 
cycle: 6 patients administered Zotiraciclib (TG02) daily (3 patients at 50 mg and 70 mg each); 9 
patients received Zotiraciclib (TG02) TIW on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19 followed by a 9-day 

Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/[ADDRESS_428538] (3 patients at 100 mg and 6 at 150 mg); 3 patients administered Zotiraciclib (TG02) BIW on 
days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, [ADDRESS_428539] (all 3 patients at 200 mg). For the BIW schedule, 
all 3 patients successfully completed Cycle 1.  No patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT).  At this time, it was decided to amend the protocol and pursue Zotiraciclib (TG02) in 
combination with carfilzomib.  No further dose escalation was evaluated for Zotiraciclib (TG02) as 
a single agent and no MTD was identified.
An open label phase Ib study was developed with the primary objectives to determine the MTD of 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) in combination with carfilzomib (American Society for Hematology [ADDRESS_428540]). Zotiraciclib (TG02) was administered once daily on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 of a 
28-day schedule. The starting dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) was 150 mg with dose escalation in 50 
mg increments up to 300 mg. Carfilzomib was administered per the Full Prescribing Information or 
in accordance with institutional guidelines at the time of the study (i.e., dosing days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 
and 16 at 20 mg/m2 for Cycle 1 and 27 mg/m2 for Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles). Fourteen patients 
were enrolled for dose escalation and 10 patients were enrolled for the MTD cohort expansion. The 
MTD for Zotiraciclib (TG02) in combination with carfilzomib was established at 250 mg 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) administered twice a week for 3 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18) on a 28-
days cycle. Two DLTs were observed, grade (Gr) [ADDRESS_428541] common drug-related adverse events were diarrhea (Gr 1-2: 4% and Gr3: 17%), nausea 
(Gr1-2: 79%), vomiting (Gr1-2: 50%), fatigue (Gr1-2: 38%, Gr3: 4%), anorexia (Gr: 21%), anemia 
(Gr1-2: 4%; Gr3:17%) and thrombocytopenia (Gr3: 8%, Gr4:13%). 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) inhibited the hERG channel, suggesting a risk factor for torsade de pointes 
(QTc prolongation) in human.  In the clinic, electrocardiographic QTc interval results for 73 patients 
enrolled in Parts 1 and 2 demonstrated that there were no clinically meaningful changes from 
baseline in resting 12-lead QTc intervals observed following administration of Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 at 10 to 200 mg doses.  Additionally, no clinically meaningful changes from 
baseline in resting 12-lead QTc intervals were observed following multiple doses of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) at 10 to 200 mg doses through Cycle 1, regardless of schedule.
Patients with prolonged QTc intervals (males: >450 ms; females: >470 ms as calculated by 
[CONTACT_6550]’s correction formula) at screening/ baseline (based on the average QTc of triplicate 
ECGs), should be assessed for the following: normal electrolyte balance and concomitant 
medications known to prolong QTc. A patient can be reassessed for QTc interval after electrolytes 
are balanced and/or concomitant medications are stopped or replaced with an alternate medication.  
Patients, who continue to have prolonged QTc despi[INVESTIGATOR_345009], will be excluded from the study.  Use of 
concomitant medications that prolong QTc interval should be avoided if possible, during this study.
Zotiraciclib (TG02) may carry a risk of damage to chromosomes and should not be given to 
pregnant women or WOCBP not using an effective form of birth control.  Men receiving 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) with female sexual partners of childbearing potential should use an effective 
form of birth control.
Zotiraciclib (TG02) may suppress bone marrow and the lymphoid system.  Based on the 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/[ADDRESS_428542] 16 patients on the phase I portion of this study, moderate to 
severe neutropenia has been observed.
1.2.3 Rationale for using Zotiraciclib (TG02) in glioma treatment
High grade glioma is a common primary CNS tumor with a poor prognosis. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_345010], the disease eventually progresses, and the treatment options are often limited at the 
time of recurrence. There is a great unmet need to develop novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_345011]-grade glioma.  
TMZ is an oral alkylating agent that has proven efficacy in AA and GBM. It has been proposed 
that the cytotoxic effect of TMZ is associated with induction of cell death or cell cycle arrest.[ 26] 
Mcl-1 was found to be essential for TMZ induced cell death.[ 27] Importantly, apoptosis was not 
found to be enhanced by [CONTACT_345040]-737, an inhibitor of Bcl-2, but not Mcl-1. However, reducing 
expression of Mcl-1 increased TMZ-induced apoptosis, suggesting that targeting Mcl-1 enhances 
TMZ-induced cell death and therefore may improve response to TMZ treatment, even in patients 
with TMZ–refractory disease. 
p53 is a transcription factor and has an important role in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis in 
response to a variety of cellular stress events. TP53 mutation is a common genetic alteration in 
glioma. The incidence of TP53 mutations is high in malignant gliomas and is reported to be 
higher in AA than GBM.[ 28] The mutant TP53 has complex effects.  There is not only the lack 
of normal p53 protein function, but there is also other mutation related gain-of-functions,[ 29] 
such as the ability to disrupt mechanisms that maintain cellular genome integrity and anti-
apoptosis.  This confers a selective survival advantage on cells within a competitive 
microenvironment. The ability to modulate Mcl-[ADDRESS_428543] Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
in an effort to enhance the apoptosis in glioma cells. 
Furthermore, MYC gene amplification and MYC over-expression have been found in human 
glioblastoma.[ 30]  MYC expression has an important role in cell growth and apoptosis. 
However, attempts to inhibit MYC haven’t been successful. Therefore, there may be indirect 
mechanisms, through inhibition of CDK9 dependent transcription, to intervene in MYC 
oncogenic signaling pathway.  
PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in brain tumors and inactivating PTEN 
mutations were found in 36% of glioblastoma based on a TCGA study.[ 31]  Importantly, this 
was only found in primary but not secondary glioblastoma.[ 32] PTEN mutation is known to 
convey resistance to apoptosis-inducing treatments such as radiation and TMZ treatment, by 
[CONTACT_345041]-apoptotic proteins, including Mcl-1.[ 33]  It was also shown that lack of PTEN 
can fuel the cell cycle by [CONTACT_345042] D and thus promotes the 
transition from G1-phase to S phase of the cell cycle.[ 34]

at 24-hour after the cell seeding and cell viability is detected following [ADDRESS_428544] 
demonstrated that a subset of patient-derived glioblastoma cells is highly sensitive to Zotiraciclib 
(TG02). The IC 50 of Zotiraciclib (TG02) are in the scale of nanomolar in the glioma cell lines 
that were studied ( Figure 8).

effects of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in treating high grade glioma, which is known for inter-tumoral 
heterogeneity. This provides the opportunity to allow enrichment of molecular markers through 
carefully designed clinical trials. GSC923, a patient derived stem-like cell line developed in 
NOB laboratory was selected as a cell model to investigate the apoptotic effect of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) in glioma. GSC923 has MGMT expression, which makes it insensitive to TMZ. It is also 
featured by [CONTACT_10216]53 mutation and PTEN mutation. High c-Myc expression was also detected in this 
cell line. The genetic makeup makes GSC923 an appropriate in vitro model to study the biology 
of high grade astrocytoma. Caspase 3 activation was detected by [CONTACT_345043]923 following Zotiraciclib (TG02) treatment. Along with the presence of 
cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and phosphorylated histone H2AX, the data 
suggested that Zotiraciclib (TG02) can induce apoptosis in glioma cells ( Figure 10). As early as 
8 hours after treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) at 50 nM, CDK9 expression was shown to be 
decreased and further decreased expression was detected at 48 hours following Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) treatment ( Figure 11).  The expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including survivin, 
XIAP, Mcl-1decreased along with the CDK9 inhibition following Zotiraciclib (TG02) treatment. 
The cell cycle analysis in GSC923 demonstrated the G2 arrest.
In summary, the potential to inhibit CDK9 activity leading to a subsequent apoptotic effect and 
modulation of cell cycle and other tyrosine kinases in cancer signaling pathways makes 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) a logical therapeutic agent to be tested in treatment of high grade 
astrocytoma. As described above, high-grade gliomas are known to harbor multiple genetic 
alterations, such as TP53 mutation, MYC amplification and PTEN that can lead to resistance to 
apoptosis and treatment failure. Zotiraciclib (TG02) is orally administered and penetrates BBB 
with good concentration in the brain. The pharmacological inhibition of CDKs with optimized 
pharmacokinetic features of Zotiraciclib (TG02) may provide a new therapeutic option for high 
grade gliomas.

1.2.4 Rationale for Zotiraciclib (TG02) starting dose
The starting dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) was decided based on the results of an open label phase 
Ib study that was developed with the primary objectives to determine the MTD of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) in combination with carfilzomib (American Society for Hematology [ADDRESS_428546]). In that study, Zotiraciclib (TG02) was administered once daily on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 
of a 28-day schedule. The starting dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) was 150mg with dose escalation 
in 50 m increments up to 300mg. Carfilzomib was administered according to the Full 
Prescribing Information or in accordance with institutional guidelines at the time of the study 
(i.e., dosing days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 at 20mg/m2 for Cycle 1 and 27mg/m2 for Cycle 2 and 
subsequent cycles). Fourteen patients were enrolled for dose escalation and 10 patients were 
enrolled for the MTD cohort expansion. The MTD for Zotiraciclib (TG02) in combination with 
carfilzomib was established at 250mg Zotiraciclib (TG02) administered twice a week for 3 
weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18) on a 28-days cycle. Carfilzomib is a selective proteasome 
inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In an 
open-label, single-arm phase 2 study (PX-171-003- A1 #[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), patients received 
single-agent carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 intravenously twice weekly for 3 of 4 weeks in cycle 1, then 
27 mg/m2 for ≤ 12 cycles.  Adverse events (AEs) were found to be manageable without 
cumulative toxicities.[ 35] Common AEs were fatigue (49%), anemia (46%), nausea (45%), and 
thrombocytopenia (39%). Thirty-three patients (12.4%) experienced peripheral neuropathy, 
primarily grades 1 or 2. Based on the Full Prescribing Information of temozolomide, more 
severe and frequent hematologic toxicities were described. In anticipation of more toxicities in 
patients receiving combination treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) and TMZ comparing to those 
receive Zotiraciclib (TG02) and carfilzomib, we decided to set the starting dose of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) relatively lower and dosing less frequently followed by [CONTACT_345044], if the 
treatment is proved to be well tolerated. The starting dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) is at 200 
mg/day orally on days 1, 12, 15, and [ADDRESS_428547] dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be given 3 days prior to Day1 in cycle 1. TMZ is 

Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
26administered at 125mg/m2 daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 orally in dd TMZ schedule and 50mg/m2 
daily in mn TMZ schedule. The dosing schedule was also designed with the intention to avoid 
potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_345012]. The proposed dosing schedule will allow patients 
have less chance to have to take both medications on the same day. Based on our preclinical data 
that Zotiraciclib (TG02) reduces expression of anti-apoptotic protein and better anti-glioma 
effects with pretreatment of Zotiraciclib (TG02) and followed by [CONTACT_234603], one 
dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be administered [ADDRESS_428548] 
cycle. In the subsequent cycles, the doses that patients receive on day 26 would be the exactly 3 
days prior to TMZ administration on day 1 of the following cycles.
1.2.5 Rationale for combination treatment with TMZ
TMZ is an alkylating agent that has been used in malignant gliomas of all grades. It produces 
O6-methylguanine in DNA, which mispairs with thymine during the next cycle of DNA 
replication. Subsequent futile cycles of DNA mismatch repair lead to a p53-associated apoptotic 
cell death. 
A seminal study from 2005 provided level 1 evidence that the addition of TMZ to radiotherapy 
for newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 
survival benefit.[ 2] Since then, TMZ has become part of standard treatment for glioblastoma. 
Not only used in newly diagnosed glioblastoma, TMZ has been also frequently used in grade II 
and III gliomas, in both upfront and recurrent settings.  Clinical studies in recurrent high grade 
gliomas also demonstrated objective response to TMZ.[ 4, 36] However, the treatment effects are 
always limited by [CONTACT_345045], including not only MGMT expression, but also 
p53 and p21 status when the mismatch repair mechanism is intact.[ 37]  In gliomas with intact 
p53 function, TMZ can cause prolonged cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, in gliomas 
with TP53 mutation, TMZ induced cell cycle arrest is not sustained.[ 38] Zotiraciclib (TG02) not 
only promotes apoptosis by [CONTACT_345046], such as Mcl-1, but also 
by [CONTACT_345047]. This broad spectrum of mechanisms of action 
makes Zotiraciclib (TG02) a strong candidate to overcome resistance to TMZ treatment and 
subsequently lead to a prolonged response to treatment.

27Figure 12: Cell viability analysis of A. GDC923; and B. U251 by [CONTACT_345048] (TG02) and TMZ alone or in combination with different sequence: 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) treatment for 6 hours followed by [CONTACT_338511]; TMZ treatment for 6 hours 
followed by [CONTACT_345033] (TG02).
The preclinical study of cell proliferation assay from Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) laboratory 
using human-derived glioblastoma cell lines have demonstrated a significant additive effect of 
inhibiting tumor cell growth with combination treatment of Zotiraciclib (TG02) and TMZ. This 
additive effect was observed in both GSC and non-GSC cell lines ( Figure 12). In in vitro study, 
GSC923 was served as a model of high grade glioma with MGMT promotor unmethylation and 
U251 was served as a model of glioma with methylated MGMT promotor. Cell lines with 
different MGMT promotor methylation status respond to combination treatment differently, 
suggesting the role of MGMT methylation as a stratification factor in the randomization of the 
clinical trials that is designed to test clinical efficacy of combination treatment of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) and TMZ in high grade gliomas. Our cell-based assay also suggests that the pretreatment 
with Zotiraciclib (TG02) followed by a combination treatment with TMZ cause better anti-
glioma effects comparing to the opposite treatment sequence. This is consistent with the 
hypothesis that Zotiraciclib (TG02) enhances the apoptotic effects of TMZ by [CONTACT_345049]-apoptotic proteins, which is supported by [CONTACT_345050] 13. 
In Figure 13, more decreased expression of survivin, XIAP and Mcl-1 is demonstrated after 
combination treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) and TMZ, comparing to the single treatment 
with either Zotiraciclib (TG02) or TMZ. These anti-apoptotic proteins seem to slightly induce by 
[CONTACT_345051], which potentially contributes to the treatment resistance.

treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02), TMZ alone and in combination at 8, 16, 24, and [ADDRESS_428549] Zotiraciclib (TG02) in combination with TMZ with two different dosing 
schedules
Once patients with glioblastoma have recurrent disease after standard treatment defined as 
concurrent radiation plus daily TMZ followed by 6-12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 
days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle), the disease is typi[INVESTIGATOR_345013]. This resistance has 
been attributed to an increase in the tumor intracellular concentration of the enzyme O6-
methlyguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT).  It has been demonstrated that if the MGMT 
can be depleted, sensitivity to alkylating agents such as TMZ can be restored.  A study by 
[CONTACT_345052] a more pronounced depletion of MGMT 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after dose-intense dosing schedule of TMZ.[ 39] 
Building on this data, many studies explored the use of alternative schedules.  The most notable 
evaluated the 7-day on – 7-day off and a metronomic schedule that used daily continuous dosing 
of 50 mg/m2 of TMZ. 
Dose-dense schedule: In a prospective study, ninety adult patients with recurrent glioma were 
treated with TMZ at 150mg/m2/day on days 1-7 and 15-21.[ 40] PFS6 was reported to be 43.8% 
and one-year survival rate was 23%. In contrast, another study in a similar patient population 
reported a PFS6 of 10% and median overall survival was 21.6 weeks.[ 41] Both studies 
demonstrated good tolerance of the treatment.  
Metronomic dosing: A study of recurrent glioma patients who received metronomic TMZ at 
50mg/m2 yielded a PFS6 of 23.9% and a 1-year survival rate of 27.3% in recurrent glioblastoma 
and a PFS6 of 35.7% and a 1-year survival of 60.7% in recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma 
patients.[ 42] TMZ with both the dose-dense (dd) and metronomic (mn) schedules showed 
promising responses in recurrent high grade glioma patients. However, the superiority of either 
dosing schedule hasn’t been established and comparison within the same clinical trial setting is 
therefore warranted. 

Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/[ADDRESS_428550] been mainly attributed to TMZ which is known for the 
bone marrow toxicities, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia. 
The complete blood count (CBC) of more than one patient happened to be tested based on 
clinical needs at several occasions. In those tests, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in some 
patients was found to be decreased significantly. Interestingly, the low ANC can be found to be 
recovered within 24-[ADDRESS_428551] grade 4 
neutropenia within 24 hours after one dose Zotiraciclib (TG02) but recovered to grade [ADDRESS_428552] of Zotiraciclib (TG02) on neutrophil biology. 
To analyze the neutrophil function after Zotiraciclib (TG02) administration, information from 
pharmacokinetic study is crucial. To further understand why this neutropenia only happened in a 
subgroup of patients but not all patients receiving Zotiraciclib (TG02), we will add 
pharmacogenetic study by [CONTACT_345053] (DMET).  
1.2.8 Rationale for the patient-reported outcome
Precedence for measuring “non-therapeutic” endpoints exists in oncology research.  For 
example, Gemcitabine was approved by [CONTACT_264330] a consequence of the decrease in 
pain reported in pancreatic patients who were treated, not on the basis of survival improvement, 
which was modest, at best. There have been efforts in neuro-oncology to evaluate secondary 
endpoints using validated instruments as an additional indicator of benefit.  
The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) allow the self-
reporting of symptom severity and interference with daily activities.  The MDASI-BT have 
demonstrated reliability and validity in the adult primary brain tumor patient population[ 43, 44]
 This tool represents a modification of the widely used and validated M.D. Anderson Symptom 
Inventory, with particular attention to symptoms common in patients with brain tumors.   The 
availability of validated instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the impact 
of treatment, both positive and negative, on patients.  The evaluation of symptom burden in this 
study will assist in finding the best possible treatment with the least toxicity.

301.2.9 Rationale for utilizing PRO-CTCAE
PRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome measurement system developed by [CONTACT_345054]. It was designed as a 
companion to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE), which is often 
used per medical professionals’ evaluation. This instrument will allow us to select, but not be 
limited to the symptoms that are anticipated based on the previous experiences. It can be a 
flexible tool for descriptive reporting system, which patients can complete it at their own 
convenience. Since the timing for assessments are within 7 days, it certainly avoids the recall 
biases. It also can be used in conjunction with the CTCAE to provide a better understanding of 
the toxicities of the clinical trial treatments.

373 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN:
3.1.1 Phase I:  
The phase I component is designed to find the MTD of Zotiraciclib (TG02) in combination with 
2 schedules of TMZ – dose dense and metronomic. Patients will be enrolled and equally assigned 
into the two dosing schedule arms for MTD finding. In each arm, the MTD will be determined 
independently using the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design, fully described in Section 8 
and recently published [ 45]. Once the MTDs of the two regimens (dd TMZ + Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) and mn TMZ + Zotiraciclib [TG02]) have been established, cohort expansion will be 
carried out at the each of the MTDs. Patients will be equally randomized into to the two cohort 
expansions. A post interim analysis cohort will be carried out in cohort 1 arm 1 to confirm MTD. 
The MTD that has higher progression-free survival rate at 4 months (PFS4) will be selected and 
used in phase II. 
3.1.2 Phase II:  
The two-arm randomized phase II will determine if the addition of Zotiraciclib (TG02) to the dd 
or mn TMZ schedule (determined by [CONTACT_345059] I) improves outcome in patients with 
recurrent malignant glioma using PFS as the primary outcomes measure.  Patients will be equally 
randomized into the combination Arm (Zotiraciclib [TG02] plus TMZ selected from phase I) and 
control arm (TMZ). The randomization will stratify by [CONTACT_345060], KPS and MGMT promoter methylation status.  Additional outcomes such as PFS6, 
overall survival from study entry and symptom burden (using the MDASI-BT instrument in 
Appendix Error! Reference source not found.) will also be collected.
The study schema is illustrated in Study Flow Chart in Appendix 15.4.
3.1.3 Definition of dose limiting toxicities (DLT)
All patients in the MTD finding phase of the phase I part will be evaluable for assessment of 
toxicity to define DLTs. The DLT-defining period is the first 4 weeks’ treatment in the Phase I 
study.
Toxicities will be graded per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0.  If multiple toxicities are seen, the presence of DLT should be based on the most 
severe toxicity experienced. DLT is defined as any of the following events occurring in the first 
cycle of treatment (4 weeks) and attributable to the study drugs:
Any of the following hematological toxicities: 
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 5 days or more.
 Febrile neutropenia defined as grade 3-4 neutropenia with fever ≥38.5ºC and/or 
infection requiring antibiotic or antifungal treatment.
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting more than 2 days.
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding of any duration
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
38Grade 3 or 4 anemia lasting more than 2 days.
Any non-hematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicity, except the following  
nausea or vomiting that responds to symptomatic therapy and lasts ≤7 days.
Diarrhea that responds to symptomatic therapy within 2 days. 
fatigue that responds to symptomatic therapy and lasts ≤7 days.
weight gain (in patients on steroids)
venous thromboembolic disease (rationale for not including this event as a DLT 
described below)
If there is a dose reduction of either or both study medications or if a dose is held or 
discontinued in cycle 1, this constitutes a DLT, per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106].
Grade [ADDRESS_428560] severe 
lymphopenia because of the previous treatments. In case of isolated laboratory 
abnormalities that may not reach clinical significance, a determination will be made by [CONTACT_976] 
[INVESTIGATOR_345015] a case-by-case basis to determine if DLT needs to be 
declared. 
Failure to recover from treatment related toxicities to be eligible for re-treatment within [ADDRESS_428561] dose of the drugs.  
3.1.4 Dose escalation 
We will employ the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design [ 46] to guide dose escalation and 
find the MTD. The details of the design are provided in Section 8. There are two treatment arms 
in the Phase I study: the combination treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) and dd TMZ; and the 
combination treatment of Zotiraciclib (TG02) with mn TMZ. Dose escalation will be conducted 
independently in these two arms. Several dose levels of Zotiraciclib (TG02) are planned as 
outlined in the Dose Escalation Table below.

* The first dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be given 3 days prior to Day1 of cycle 1. The 
subsequent doses for cycle 1 will be given on days 1, 12, 15, and 26. Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be 
given on days 1, 12, 15, and 26 every 28-days cycle in all the cycles starting cycle 2. 
**BSA (body surface area) for Temozolomide dosing calculation will be capped at 2.2m2 to avoid 
excessive risk of myelosuppression.
*** One patient in MN arm developed severe toxicities which lead to ICU admission after one 
dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) at 300mg. The etiology was not completely clear. However, due to the 
patient’s safety concern, does level II of Zotiraciclib (TG02) was determined to be eliminated in 
both study arms by [CONTACT_345061].
3.2 DRUG ADMINISTRATION
3.2.1 Phase I treatment
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug dosage
There are two treatment arms in this component: the combination treatment of Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) and dd TMZ; and the combination treatment of Zotiraciclib (TG02) with mn TMZ. In 
both treatment arms, several dose levels are planned as outlined in section 3.1.4. The starting 
dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) is 200 mg/day orally on days 1, 12, 15, and [ADDRESS_428562] dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be given 3 days 
prior to Day1 in cycle 1. The dosing schedule for both treatment arms are illustrated in the 
Appendix 15.6. TMZ is administered at 125mg/m2 daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 orally in dd 
TMZ schedule and 50mg/m2 daily in mn TMZ schedule. The dosing schedule was designed 
with the intention to avoid potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_345012]. The proposed dosing 
schedule will allow patients have less chance to have to take both medications on the same day. 
Based on our preclinical data that Zotiraciclib (TG02) reduces expression of anti-apoptotic 
protein and better anti-glioma effects with pretreatment of Zotiraciclib (TG02) and followed by 
[CONTACT_234603], one dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be administered [ADDRESS_428563] cycle. In the subsequent cycles, the doses that patients receive on 
day 26 would be the exactly 3 days prior to TMZ administration on day 1 of the following 
cycles. We will employ the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design [ 46] to guide dose 
escalation and find the MTD. The details of the design are provided in Section 8.
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
[IP_ADDRESS] Cohort expansion:
After identifying the MTD for each of the TMZ dosing schedules in combination with 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) (i.e., 125mg/m2 TMZ on days 1-7 and 15-21 per cycle, and 50 mg/m2 
TMZ daily), cohort expansion will be conducted independently at each of the MTDs until the 
total number of patients treated at each of the MTDs reaches 18 patients (including the patients 
who have been treated in the dose-finding part). The dosing schedule with a higher PFS4 will be 
selected and used in phase II.
[IP_ADDRESS] Post interim analysis cohort: 
Patients will be enrolled to Arm 1 only to receive Zotiraciclib (at Dose level 0 and in 
combination of dd TMZ).  TG02 dose is 200 mg/day orally on days 1, 12, 15, and [ADDRESS_428564] dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be given 3 days prior to 
Day1 in cycle 1. TMZ is administered at 125mg/m2 daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 orally on a 28-
days cycle.
3.2.2 Phase II treatment:
The combination treatment selected from phase I (with better PFS4) will be tested against the 
TMZ alone with the same dosing schedule as it is in the combination arm. Patients will be 
randomized on a 1:1 basis between two competing treatment arms: TMZ + Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
versus TMZ alone using a Bayesian phase II trial design. The details of the design are provided 
in Section 8.
The dosage for the combination arm is derived from the MTD of the combination determined in 
the phase I component of the study. The treatment schedule will be identical to that described 
above in the phase I component, with each cycle comprising 28 days. 
Patients will continue treatment until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs or 
completion of 12 cycles of treatment.  At progression, patients randomized to the control arm 
(TMZ alone) will be offered the opportunity to continue TMZ and the additional treatment with 
Zotiraciclib (TG02). After administration of 12 cycles of treatment, patients may stay on the 
study treatment, if there is evidence of clinical benefit based on treating physician’s discretion.
If patient vomits Zotiraciclib (TG02), do not re-administer.
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATION/DELAYS:
If an adverse event occurs wherein both TMZ and Zotiraciclib (TG02) would require dose de-
escalation, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_345016] 2 
study drugs with the consideration of previously known drug toxicities/side effects in an effort to 
further define attribution.

3.3.1 Temozolomide (TMZ) Dose Modifications
Dose modification(s) are based on adverse event occurrence and may be implemented during any 
treatment cycle ( Table 11) or prior to initiation of each new cycle per Table 8.  If multiple AEs 
are seen, the dose administered should be based on the dose reduction required for the most 
severe grade of any single AE. If TMZ is delayed or discontinued in combination therapy, the 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) component of treatment may continue, unless there is clear reason to 
discontinue Zotiraciclib (TG02) simultaneously.

For treatment on day 1 of each cycle (within the prior 72 hours), ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelet 
count ≥ 100 x 109/L and all grade 2 -3 non-hematologic AEs (except nausea and vomiting) must 
have resolved (to grade ≤ 1). For grade 4, discontinue treatment. For the purposes of this study, 
any clinically insignificant Grade [ADDRESS_428565] still not resolved to grade 1 or less: then any further treatment with 
temozolomide should be stopped, as summarized in Table 8 and Table 11.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose reductions (Summarized in Table 11)
If any non-hematologic AE observed was grade 3 (except nausea and vomiting) and/or if 
platelets < 50 x 109/L and/or ANC < 1 x 109/L, then the dose should be reduced by [CONTACT_37387]. For patients who would require dose reductions to a dose level < -2 as defined in table 10, 
temozolomide will be stopped. Also, if any of the same non-hematologic grade 3 AE recurs 
(except, nausea and vomiting,) after reduction for that AE, then temozolomide will be stopped. 
If any treatment-related non-hematologic AE observed was grade 4 (except nausea and vomiting) 
then adjuvant temozolomide treatment should be stopped. 
Any dose reductions of temozolomide will be determined according to (1) non-hematologic AE, 
as well as (2) the lowest/worst ANC and platelet counts observed. No dose escalation should be 
attempted. If the dose reduction occurs in the middle of the cycle, the reduced dose should be 
applied as soon as the treatment resumes (i.e. next dose).
3.3.2 Zotiraciclib (TG02) Dose Modifications
If multiple AEs are seen, the dose administered should be based on the dose reduction required 
for the most severe grade of any single AE.  Prior studies of Zotiraciclib (TG02) indicate that 
non-hematologic toxicities have been the dose-limiting toxicities.  Therefore, in the combination 
regimens, attribution of treatment-related toxicities will be made based on best available 
information.  As Zotiraciclib (TG02) has not been reported with high rates of prolonged 
myelotoxicity, these toxicities will likely be attributed to temozolomide and dose modifications 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
43made as outlined in Section 3.3.1 above.  Conversely, non-hematologic adverse events such as 
nausea and vomiting, intractable diarrhea, fatigue and prolongation of the QTc interval on ECG 
will be attributed to Zotiraciclib (TG02).  Liver toxicities are a known toxicity of TMZ, which 
has been tested extensively in patients with high grade glioma. Zotiraciclib (TG02) has also been 
reported to cause elevated liver enzymes. To better understand the attribution of this toxicity, in 
the event of elevated ALT/ AST of grade 2 or above when a patient has received the combined 
treatment, dose modification will be made on one drug at a time. Should the need for dose 
modification arise again due to the same toxicity, dose of the second drug will be reduced.  If a 
dose reduction occurs in the middle of the cycle, the reduced dose should be applied as soon as 
the treatment resumes.
Details for dose modification, delay at beginning of each cycle and during the cycle are 
summarized in Table 8 and Table 11 respectively.   
The dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be initiated at the phase I dose for patients enrolled on the 
dose-finding component or at the MTD for both the cohort expansion of the phase I and the 
phase II component of the trial. The same dose will be continued unless > or = grade 3 drug 
related toxicity occurs; treatment will be held until toxicity resolves to grade 1 or less. At that 
time, the dose will be reduced to one level below the dose that caused the grade 3 toxicity. Only 
two dose reductions will be allowed for Zotiraciclib (TG02).   Patients enrolled prior to 
determination of the MTD will have stepwise reductions as necessary based on the Table 10 
below.  Please note, if the MTD is 150 mg/day, then no dose reduction will be allowed.  
Additionally, if the patient is treated at dose Level 0, only one dose reduction (to 150 mg/day) 
will be allowed.

3.3.3 Pre-medications
[IP_ADDRESS]  Zotiraciclib (TG02)
Patients must receive vigorous prophylactic treatment for nausea and vomiting.  Prophylactic use of 
moderately anti-emetogenic treatments (e.g., 5-HT3 antagonist) has been more effective at 
controlling nausea and vomiting than lightly anti-emetogenic treatments or treatment after onset. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Prophylaxis for Nausea/Vomiting
Zotiraciclib (TG02) is potentially highly emetogenic. Vigorous anti-emetic prophylaxis is 
required prior to administration of Zotiraciclib (TG02) and should continue at least 24 hours after 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) administration or until nausea/vomiting returns to Grade 0 or 1. Anti-emetic 
prophylaxis is also highly recommended to be started on the day prior to Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
administration. 
Some recommended prophylaxis regimens include but is not limited to the following:
5-HT3 antagonist (e.g., ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron, etc.) 
2.5 mg olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] 
other moderate anti-emetic regimens tailored to the individual patient at the Investigator’s 
discretion
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Prophylaxis for Diarrhea
Due to frequent reports of diarrhea with Zotiraciclib (TG02) administration, vigorous anti-
diarrheal prophylaxis (e.g., loperamide or equivalent) is required prior to administration of 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) and should continue at least 24 hours after Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
administration or until diarrhea returns to Grade 0 or 1.  
The recommended prophylaxis includes but is not limited to the following:  
a. Loperamide the day prior to and the day of Zotiraciclib (TG02). Suggest that if patient 
had diarrhea on day of Zotiraciclib (TG02) that Loperamide 2-4mg is administered 
following first loose stool on day after Zotiraciclib (TG02) and after each stool if an hour 
as elapsed since last dose, as needed thereafter.
b. Once diarrhea has occurred, Loperamide 4mg after first loose stool, and Loperamide 4mg 
after the second and third stool respectively, with patient to call the study team 
practitioner after third loose stool.  
c. Consider Lomotil and Tincture of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], if diarrhea continues. A nutrition consult may 
also be beneficial for potential diet modifications.

463.4 QUESTIONNAIRES
3.4.1 MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT):
The MDASI-BT will be administered at baseline and at the time of imaging analysis as outlined 
in the protocol. Of note, every attempt should be made to administer the MDASI-BT prior to 
informing the patients about the results of the imaging study. The MDASI-BT will be completed 
only by [CONTACT_102], unless changes in vision or weakness make this difficult. If this occurs, then 
the caregiver or research assistant may read the questions to the patient or assist with marking the 
severity number or score as described by [CONTACT_102]. A caregiver may complete the 
questionnaires as a patient proxy if the patient’s deficits preclude self-report; however, this must 
be done at every assessment from baseline to end of treatment.  In addition, information 
regarding demographics and treatment history will be collected as part of the larger study and 
used in this analysis.   
The MDASI-BT consist of symptoms rated on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) to indicate the 
presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being “not present” and 10 being “as bad as you 
can imagine.” Each symptom is rated at its worst in the last 24 hours. Symptoms included on the 
instrument include those commonly associated with cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and those associated with 
the underlying disease.  The questionnaire also includes ratings of how much symptoms 
interfered with different aspects of a patient’s life in the last 24 hours. These interference items 
include: general activity, mood, work (includes both work outside the home and housework), 
relations with other people, walking, and enjoyment of life. The interference items are also 
measured on 0 - 10 scales. The average time to complete this instrument is 5 minutes. The 
MDASI-BT has been translated into multiple languages, but the English language version will be 
used for this study[ 44].
3.4.2 PRO-CTCAE*:
Patients will complete a baseline PRO-CTCAE any time after enrollment but before starting 
treatment, and again on days 2, 8, 14, 21, and 28 in each treatment cycle, if the patient is able. 
There are 13 questions in total. The questions are focused on 12 symptoms that are commonly 
reported by [CONTACT_345062] (TG02). It takes 5-[ADDRESS_428566] with marking the answers as described by [CONTACT_102]. A patient caregiver may complete 
the questionnaires as a patient-preference proxy if the patient’s deficits preclude self-report. The 
questionnaires are allowed to be completed within +/-[ADDRESS_428567] 2 questionnaires per cycle.  
*The PRO-CTCAE will not be performed in the Post Interim Analysis cohort.

4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
4.1 MEDICATIONS TO AVOID OR USE WITH PRECAUTION (ZOTIRACICLIB [TG02])
4.1.1 Medications that Prolong QTc
Use of certain medications that prolong QTc interval should be avoided throughout the trial. These 
medications include but are not limited to: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, 
roxithromycin, metronidazole (with alcohol), moxifloxacin, fluconazole (in cirrhosis), ketoconazole, 
nelfinavir, chloroquine, mefloquine, halothane, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine, 
amiodarone, sotalol, amitriptyline, clomipramine, impi[INVESTIGATOR_345020], dothiepin, doxepin, risperidone, 
fluphenazine, haloperidol, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], thioridiazine, ziprasidone, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], droperidol, terfenadine, 
astemizole, probucol, dolasetron mesylate, and cisapride. 
However, it is understood that patients with malignancy treated with potentially myelotoxic 
cytotoxic chemotherapy may require certain classes of medications such as azole antifungal agents 
and certain antibiotics that have been reported to prolong QTc. If patients require these medications 
every effort should be made to maintain a normal electrolyte balance with special attention to K+ 
and Mg++ levels. An ECG in triplicate should be obtained after beginning such a medication to 
determine any change to the QTc duration based on the average QTc of triplicate ECGs. 
In the event of QT/QTc prolongation, electrolytes will be corrected to keep the potassium and 
magnesium within normal limits and the ECG in triplicate will be repeated. Patients may be 
monitored on telemetry at the Investigator's discretion.
During the trial, patients who show a QTc interval prolongation as per CTCAE (based on the 
average QTc of triplicate ECGs) as calculated by [CONTACT_6550]’s correction formula, should be tested 
for the electrolytes noted above. If the electrolytes are at normal levels but QTc interval remains 
prolonged, study drug should be held until QTc interval is no longer prolonged.
4.1.2 CYP450 Drug Interactions (Related to Drug Metabolism)
Strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and drugs that are known substrates for 
CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index should be used with caution in this study. 
Known inhibitors of CYP1A2 include acyclovir and fluvoxamine, and known inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 include atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
53nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin. 
Known inducers of CYP1A2 include omeprazole, insulin, and cigarette smoking, and known 
inducers of CYP3A4 include rifampin and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
Sensitive CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices include theophylline and tizanidine, 
and sensitive CYP2D6 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices include thioridazine and 
tamoxifen. 
Exceptions are allowed per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], if clinically indicated.
4.2 MEDICATIONS TO AVOID OR USE WITH PRECAUTION (TMZ)
Administration of valproic acid decreases oral clearance of temozolomide by [CONTACT_2902] 5%.
4.3 G-CSF AND ERYTHROPOIETIN ADMINISTRATION: 
Routine prophylactic use is not permitted. However, therapeutic use in patients with 
complications (severe neutropenia with fever or anemia), may be considered at the investigator’s 
discretion.
4.4 PLATELET SUPPORT:
Prophylactic use of platelet is only used when Platelet count < 20 x 109/L. Platelet transfusion is 
provided for active bleeding patients with thrombocytopenia to keep platelet count above 50 x 
109/L.

discontinued if possible.
4.6 FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA 
It may be managed according to the local institution's Infectious Disease guidelines.  Measures 
may include appropriate laboratory testing, including blood and urine cultures and the institution 
of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  If a source for the fever is not identified or the fever resolves 
when the neutrophil count recovers, antibiotics may be discontinued, and the patient observed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for storage of tissue specimens in the Laboratory of Pathology
Tissues designated for clinical diagnostics are transported to the Laboratory of Pathology (LP) 
where they are examined grossly, and relevant portions are fixed, embedded in paraffin and 
sectioned and stained for diagnostic interpretation.  Unutilized excess tissues are stored for up to 
three months, in accordance with College of American Pathologists/Joint Commission on 
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (CAP/JCAHO) guidelines, and then 
discarded.  Following completion of the diagnostic workup, the slides and tissue blocks are 
stored indefinitely in the LP’s clinical archives.  All specimens are catalogued and retrieved 
utilizing the clinical laboratory information systems, in accordance with CAP/JCAHO 
regulations.  The use of any stored specimens for research purposes is only allowed when the 
appropriate IRB approval has been obtained.  In some cases, this approval has been obtained via

6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA
6.3.1 General
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is progression free survival (PFS) from patient 
registration.  However, objective response status should be measured and recorded. 
6.3.2 Definitions
Evaluable for maximum tolerated dose: All subjects enrolled in the Phase I dose escalation 
cohorts from the time of their first treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) +TMZ to the end of cycle 
1. Patients who develop a DLT during cycle 1 and thus do not complete treatment for the cycle 
should be considered evaluable for MTD.
Evaluable for toxicity:  All eligible patients who complete at least one cycle of protocol therapy 
or who have a DLT after the protocol therapy is started are evaluable for toxicity from the time 
of their first treatment. 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
63*If the patients miss doses of Zotiraciclib (TG02) or TMZ in the first cycle of treatment due to 
reasons that are unrelated to toxicity, it will be the PI’s decision about whether they are evaluable 
for toxicity in the dose finding stage.  
Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy at MTD and have had their disease re-
evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response 
classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
Phase I patients removed from study treatment within 28 days for reasons other than toxicity 
may be replaced.
6.3.3 Disease Parameters
Measurable Disease: Bi-dimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins by [CONTACT_86467]-
DPTA enhanced MRI scan.
Evaluable Disease: Uni-dimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not clearly 
defined. Patients with only this kind of imaging will not be allowed to enter this study unless 
they have recently undergone surgery and have histologically proven recurrent disease.
Non-Evaluable Disease: Not Applicable for response evaluation.
Objective-Status, To Be Recorded at Each Evaluation: If there are too many measurable lesions 
to measure at each evaluation, choose the largest two to be followed before a patient is entered 
on study.  The remaining lesions will be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status 
determination.  Unless progression is observed, objective status can only be determined when 
ALL measurable and evaluable sites and lesions are assessed.
6.3.4 Response Criteria
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new proposed criteria 
Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO) (see Appendix 15.5 ).[ 49] 
Complete response: Requires all of the following:
Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks.
No new lesions and stable or improved non-enhancing lesions (T2/FLAIR)
Patient off steroids or on physiologic replacement only.
Stable or improved clinically.
Partial response: Requires all of following:

6.3.7 Duration of Response
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.

1= Minor neurologic symptoms, fully active at home/work without assistance
2= Moderate neurologic symptoms, fully active at home/work but requires assistance
3= Moderate neurologic symptoms, less than fully active at home/work and requires assistance
4= Severe neurologic symptoms, totally inactive requiring complete assistance at home or 
institution, unable to work

8.5 REPORTING PREGNANCY 
8.5.1 Maternal  exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of 
when the Investigator becomes aware of it. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later 
than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy become known,
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria (section 8.1.2) should be reported as 
SAEs. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented.
8.5.[ADDRESS_428595] dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02)
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_428596] and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_428597] annually in a summary format.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING PLAN
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/[ADDRESS_428598] the interpretation of primary and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through 
independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on:
Informed consent process
Eligibility confirmation
Drug administration and accountability
Adverse events monitoring
Response assessment.
The monitoring program also extends to multi-site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 PHASE I COMPONENT: 
We will employ the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design [ 46] to find the MTD. The BOIN 
design is a novel Bayesian dose-finding method that optimizes patient ethics by [CONTACT_345079]-therapeutic and overly toxic doses. The BOIN design yields 
an average performance comparable to that of the continual reassessment method (CRM) in 
terms of selecting the MTD, but has a lower risk of assigning patients to sub-therapeutic or 
overly toxic doses (i.e., better patient ethics). 
There are two dosing schedule treatment arms in the Phase I study: the combination treatment 
with Zotiraciclib (TG02) and dd TMZ; and the combination treatment of Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
with mn TMZ. Dose finding will be conducted independently in these two arms. For each arm, 
the target toxicity rate is 0.35 and the maximum sample size for dose finding is 24 patients. We 
will enroll and treat patients in cohorts of size 3. We consider four dose levels and the starting 
dose is level 0 (i.e., TMZ 125mg/m2 + 200mg/day Zotiraciclib (TG02)).

* The first dose of Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be given 3 days prior to Day1 of cycle 1. The 
subsequent doses for cycle 1 will be given on days 1, 12, 15, and 26. Zotiraciclib (TG02) will be 
given on days 1, 12, 15, and 26 every 28-day cycle in all the cycles starting cycle 2. 
** One patient in MN arm developed severe toxicities which lead to ICU admission after one dose 
of Zotiraciclib (TG02) at 300mg. The etiology was not completely clear. However, due to the 
patient’s safety concern, does level II of Zotiraciclib (TG02) was determined to be eliminated in 
both study arms by [CONTACT_345080].
The BOIN trial design is described as follows:
1. Patients in the first cohort are treated at dose level 0. 
2. To assign a dose to the next cohort of patients, we conduct dose escalation/de-escalation 
according to the rule displayed in Table 13.
Table 13: Dose escalation/de-escalation rule for the BOIN design.
The number of patients treated at the current dose
Action 3 6 9 12 15 18

De-escalate if # of patients 
who experienced DLT >=2 3 4 6 7 8
Eliminate if # of patients 
who experienced DLTs >=3 5 6 7 9 10
When using Table 13, please note the following:
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
72(a) “Eliminate” means that we eliminate the current and higher doses from the trial to 
prevent treating any future patients at these doses because they are overly toxic. 
(b) When we eliminate a dose, we automatically de-escalate the dose to the next lower level. 
When the lowest dose is eliminated, we stop the trial for safety. In this case, no dose should 
be selected as the MTD. 
(c) If none of the actions (i.e., escalation, de-escalation or elimination) is triggered, we treat 
the new patients at the current dose.
(d) If the current dose is the lowest dose and the rule indicates dose de-escalation, we will 
treat the new patients at the lowest dose unless the number of DLTs reaches the elimination 
boundary, at which point we will terminate the trial for safety.  
(e) If the current dose is the highest dose and the rule indicates dose escalation, we will treat 
the new patients at the highest dose.
(f) If the number of patients treated at the current (or any) dose reaches 12, we will stop the 
trial early and select the MTD as described below.
3. Repeat step [ADDRESS_428599] the MTD based on isotonic regression as specified 
previously. [ 46] Specifically, we select as the MTD the dose for which the isotonic estimate of 
the toxicity rate is closest to the target toxicity rate. If there are ties, we select the higher dose 
level when the isotonic estimate is lower than the target toxicity rate; and we select the lower 
dose level when the isotonic estimate is greater than the target toxicity rate.
After identifying the MTD for each of the TMZ dosing schedules in combination with 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) (i.e., 125mg/m2 TMZ on days 1-7 and 15-21 per cycle, and 50 mg/m2 TMZ 
daily), cohort expansion will be conducted independently at each of the MTDs until the total 
number of patients treated at each of the MTDs reaches 18 patients (including the patients who 
have been treated in the dose-finding part). The dosing schedule with a higher PFS at 4 months 
(PFS4) will be selected and used in phase II. If the difference between the PFS4 values from the 
two full cohorts treated at each of the MTDs is less than 10% of the average of the two PFS4 
values, then the dosing schedule with fewer AEs will be selected as the “winner.” During the 
cohort expansion phase, the elimination rule displayed in the last row of Table 13 will be used to 
monitor toxicity. Given the cohort expansion of 18 patients at the MTD, there is 72.6% chance to 
correctly pi[INVESTIGATOR_345024]4 for two schedules are 50% and 60% (i.e., 10% 
difference in PFS4), respectively; and there is 81.9% chance to correctly pi[INVESTIGATOR_345025]4 for two schedules are 50% and 65% (i.e., 15% difference in PFS4) 
Table 14 shows the operating characteristics of the BOIN design for this trial with 4 scenarios 
defined by [CONTACT_345081] 4 doses.  These operating characteristics are based on 1,000 
simulations of the trial using R package “BOIN”, which is available from CRAN.  The operating 
characteristics show that the design selects the true MTD with high probabilities and allocates 
more patients to the dose levels with the DLT rate closest to the target of 0.35.

selected, cohort expansion will be conducted at the MTD until the total number of patients 
treated at the MTD reaches 18 patients (including the patients who have been treated in the dose-
finding part). Thus, no more than 12 additional patients will be enrolled during the cohort 
expansion phase. Therefore, the maximum number of patients for phase I, including dose finding 
and cohort expansion, is 24+12=36 patients per treatment arm, and 72 in total for two treatment 
arms.
During the interim analysis of the Phase I study, we identified TG02 of 250 mg as the MTD in 
both Arm 1 and Arm 2. Cohort expansion was conducted independently at each of the MTD into 
treatment arms, and the PSF4 was found to be 38% in Arm 1 and 25% in Arm 2. Therefore, 
based on the preplanned analysis, the DD TMZ dosing schedule is considered a “winner” to be 
used in Phase II study. However, a better PFS was found in patients who received TG02 at dose 
level 0, compared to those received TG02 at dose level 1, which is MTD, in Arm 1, the winner 
arm, suggesting the lower dose with the scheduled TMZ may be sufficient if not more beneficial 
for patients with recurrent high grade astrocytoma. However, we cannot make the conclusion 
based on the small sample number in Arm 1 at dose level 0. Therefore, we would like to continue 
enrolling to the maximum, allow the additional 12 patients enrolled to be treated with TG02 at 
dose level 0 combined with dd TMZ. 
We do not plan to change the study design. The primary endpoint is still toxicity. The objective 
is to add a small cohort expansion to better characterize the dose-toxicity relationship and obtain 
some preliminary efficacy readout to determine RP2D. If PFS4 month difference between MTD 
and (MTD-1) is less than 5%, select the lower dose, I.e., MTD-1, as the RP2D; otherwise select 
the MTD as RP2D.
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
74There should not be safety concerns because additional patients will be treated with TG02 at a 
dose that is lower than the MTD that was identified previously. 
The purpose for enrolling more patients is to further define a dosage not only safe but optimal for 
the patients before we move to Phase II study. Only AE and PFS4 will be recorded in these 
subjects. 
10.2 PHASE II COMPONENT:
A randomized phase II trial will be used to compare the combination of Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus 
TMZ (selected from phase I) with TMZ alone in patients with recurrent grade III or IV malignant 
glioma. The TMZ alone arm will use the same dosing schedule as it is in the combination arm.  
The primary endpoint is progression free survival. We will enroll at least [ADDRESS_428601] 
40 patients for each arm at a rate of 4 patients per month. Patients will be equally randomized 
into two arms. Patients’ KPS, MGMT promoter methylation status of the tumors and the 
presence of measurable disease at study entry will be used as stratification factors. We will 
follow all patients for at least 12 months, and monitor futility and toxicity as described below. 
We will use the methods described by [CONTACT_223906]., to monitor progression-free survival (PFS), 
and we will stop enrolling patients early if, based on the available data, we have reason to 
believe that the median PFS of  the Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ arm is less than that of the  
TMZ arm.[ 50] Formally, we will stop enrolling patients early if
Pr (median PFS TG02+TMZ ≥ median PFS TMZ | data from the trial) < 0.78,
The futility monitoring will be conducted after enrolling 20, 40 and 60 patients (for two arms 
combined). Below are the operating characteristics of the above futility monitoring rule, 
assuming that the median PFS of the TMZ alone arm is 3 months.
Table 15 Operating Characteristics of the Futility Monitoring rule

Early stop probability 0.999 0.812 0.374 0.170 0.097
Average sample size 23.7 42.1 62.6 70.9 74.7
Similar Bayesian methods will also be used to monitor the rate of DLT. We will monitor the two 
arms independently. Specifically, we will stop enrolling patients if the Pr(DLT > 35% | data) > 
0.9. That is, we will stop enrolling patients if the data indicate that there is more than 90% chance 
that the true DLT rate is higher than 35%. This decision rule gives the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], 
assuming a Beta (0.1, 0.4) prior distribution for DLT rate, 
Stop enrolling pts if [# of pts with DLT] / [# of pts evaluated] ≥ 4/5, 6/10, 10/20, and 15/30.
Below are the operating characteristics of the toxicity monitoring rule.

Average sample size 39.6 37.3 31.0 21.3 13.5
At progression, patients on the control arm will be offered treatment with Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
in combination with continued treatment with TMZ.  If an effective salvage regimen, this may 
impact the secondary OS endpoint, but will not affect the primary endpoint of the study. The 
maximum number is 80 patients.
Statistical Analysis Plan
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of 
patients.  We will tabulate adverse events by [CONTACT_345082]. For the cohort 
expansion and phase II component, we will estimate the proportion of patients with response 
with 95% exact binomial confidence intervals, and use descriptive statistics to summarize 
response duration.  We will estimate PFS/OS with the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator. 
Log-rank test will be used to compare the PFS/OS between Zotiraciclib (TG02)+TMZ and 
TMZ.
Changes of symptom burden (i.e., MDASI-BT) through study time points will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_54959] t-tests and linear mixed model. In the mixed model, subject-specific random intercept 
will be used to account for within-subject correlation, and measurement time will be included 
as a covariate. A sample size of 40 patients has 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_428602] and 
linear mixed model will be used to evaluate differences in symptom burden using the 
MDASI-BT between Zotiraciclib (TG02) plus TMZ and TMZ. Cox proportional hazard 
model will be used to evaluate the relationship between MDASI-BT and disease progression. 
Logistic regression will be used to evaluate the relationship between MDASI-BT and 
tolerance to treatment.
Treatment effects will be evaluated by [CONTACT_345083]. Perfusion and diffusion –
based MRI parameters, including but not restricted to blood volume, blood flow mean and 
median Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) value will be analysed. Results will be 
summarized. The mean and median value at different time points will be tabulated. Changes in 
such parameters will be analysed for statistical significance and correlate with the disease status.  
10.2.1 Patient Reported Outcomes
Received MDASI-BT form will be checked versus the timing schedule and considered as valid if 
they fall within ten days of the scheduled assessment window.  Compliance rates will be 
calculated as the number of received valid forms over the number of expected forms. Differences 
between groups in compliance will be tested by [CONTACT_264348]’s exact test at every time point.
We will use descriptive statistics to describe how patients rate symptom severity and interference 
with function at each time point.  Error bar graphs for each of the symptoms will be constructed 
at each time point.  The proportion of patients rating their symptoms to be 5 or greater (on a 0-10 
scale) will also be reported.  We will construct individual patient profiles for each of the selected 
symptoms to describe the individual patients’ patterns of change over time. We will calculate the

Estimates of differences in the mean symptom severity and mean symptom interference between

the symptom severity and symptom interference measures. For example, an increase of 2 points 
or more would mean a moderate improvement, whereas a decrease of 2 points or more would be 
interpreted as moderate worsening. For individual symptoms, a rise in a symptom score means 
deterioration, whereas a reduced score means improvement of the specific symptom.

For more information, please refer to the Package Insert.
13.1.[ADDRESS_428612] be dispensed in a separate vial or in its original package (one 
strength per one container). Follow the instructions below: Based on the dose prescribed, 
determine the number of each strength of TEMODAR capsules that are needed. Label each 
container with the appropriate number of capsules to be taken each day. Dispense to the patient, 
making sure each container lists the strength (mg) per capsule and that he or she understands to 
take the appropriate number of capsules of TEMODAR from each package or vial to equal the 
total daily dose prescribed by [CONTACT_099]. TEMODAR is store at 25°C, excursions permitted 
to 15-30°C.
13.1.[ADDRESS_428613] milk. Because many drugs 
are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing 
infants and tumorigenicity shown for temozolomide in animal studies, a decision should be made 
whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of 
TEMODAR to the mother.
13.1.4 Administration procedures
Patients should take each day’s dose with a full glass of water at the same time each day. Taking 
the medication on an empty stomach or at bedtime may help ease nausea. If patients are also 
taking anti-nausea or other medications to relieve the side effects associated with TEMODAR, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/[ADDRESS_428614] common adverse reactions (≥10% incidence) are: alopecia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
headache, constipation, anorexia, convulsions, rash, hemiparesis, diarrhea, asthenia, fever, 
dizziness, coordination abnormal, viral infection, amnesia, and insomnia. The most common 
Grade 3 to 4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities (≥10% incidence) that have developed 
during treatment with temozolomide are: lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
leukopenia. 
The adverse reaction from clinical trials that are conducted in different patient population are 
summarized as following:
Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: During the concomitant phase (TEMODAR+radiotherapy), 
adverse reactions including thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and constipation 
were more frequent in the TEMODAR+RT arm. The incidence of other adverse reactions was 
comparable in the two arms. The most common adverse reactions across the cumulative
TEMODAR experience were alopecia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, headache, and constipation. 
Forty-nine percent (49%) of patients treated with TEMODAR reported one or more severe or 
life-threatening reactions, most commonly fatigue (13%), convulsions (6%), headache (5%), and 
thrombocytopenia (5%). Overall, the pattern of reactions during the maintenance phase was
consistent with the known safety profile of TEMODAR. Myelosuppression (neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia), which is a known dose-limiting toxicity for most cytotoxic agents, including 
TEMODAR, was observed. When laboratory abnormalities and adverse reactions were 
combined, Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities including neutropenic reactions were 
observed in 8% of the patients, and Grade 3 or Grade 4 platelet abnormalities, including 
thrombocytopenic reactions, were observed in 14% of the patients treated with TEMODAR.
Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma: The incidence of adverse reactions in the 158 patients in 
the anaplastic astrocytoma study for whom data are available. In the absence of a control group, 
it is not clear in many cases whether these reactions should be attributed to temozolomide or the 
patients’ underlying conditions, but nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hematologic effects appear to 
be clearly drug-related. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting,
headache, and fatigue. The adverse reactions were usually NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) 
Grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate in severity) and were self-limiting, with nausea and vomiting 
readily controlled with anti-emetics. The incidence of severe nausea and vomiting (CTC Grade 3 
or 4) was 10% and 6%, respectively. Myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) was 
the dose-limiting adverse reaction. It usually occurred within the first few cycles of therapy and 
was not cumulative. Myelosuppression occurred late in the treatment cycle and returned to 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
81normal, on average, within 14 days of nadir counts. The median nadirs occurred at 26 days for 
platelets (range: 21-40 days) and 28 days for neutrophils (range: 1-44 days). Only 14%
(22/158) of patients had a neutrophil nadir and 20% (32/158) of patients had a platelet nadir, 
which may have delayed the start of the next cycle. Less than 10% of patients required 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], blood transfusion, or discontinuation of therapy due to myelosuppression.
In clinical trial experience with 110 to 111 women and 169 to 174 men (depending on 
measurements), there were higher rates of Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC less than 500 cells/μL) and 
thrombocytopenia (less than 20,000 cells/μL) in women than men in the first cycle of therapy 
(12% vs. 5% and 9% vs. 3%, respectively). In the entire safety database for which hematologic 
data exist (N=932), 7% (4/61) and 9.5% (6/63) of patients over age [ADDRESS_428615] cycle, respectively. For patients less than or equal to 
age 70, 7% (62/871) and 5.5% (48/879) experienced Grade [ADDRESS_428616] also been reported.

1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) in Acute Leukemia Patients
Fifty-five acute leukemia patients were evaluated for the safety and efficacy of single agent 
Zotiraciclib (TG02). 96% (53/55) patients experienced Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
(TEAE). Most frequently reported TEAEs (43/55 patients 78%) occurred in the System Organ 
Class of Gastrointestinal Disorders. They were also frequently reported in the following System 
Oran Classes: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (23/55 patients, 42%), 
Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (22/55 patients, 40%), Nervous system Disorders 
(17/55patients, 31%), Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (14/55 patients, 25%), 
and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (12/55 patients, 22%).
The most frequently reported TEAEs were as follows: nausea (32/55 patients, 58%), vomiting 
(21/55 patients 38%), fatigue (15/55 patients, 27%) and diarrhea, decreased appetite and 
abdominal pain (13/55 patients each, 24%).
Thirty-nine patients (39/55 patients, 71%) had ≥1 treatment-related TEAEs. Five patients (9%) 
experienced grade 5/fatal TEAE and all five were assed as unrelated to the study drug by [CONTACT_1275]. Three patients (5%) had grade 4/life threatening TEAE, including hyperglycemia, 
cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_345026]. All events were assed as unrelated to the study 
drug. The most commonly reported grade 3TEAEs were fatigue (11%) and nausea (7%).
When TEAEs were analyzed by [CONTACT_225974], regardless of causality, five acute 
leukemia patients (5/55 [9%]) who were administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
experienced a Grade 5/fatal TEAE (Schedule A, 3/27 patients [11%]; Schedule B, 2/22 [9%]; 
Schedule D, 0/6 [0%]). The Preferred Terms for the Grade 5 TEAEs were pneumonia (2 
patients), sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, and cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374]. All five events were 
assessed as unrelated to study drug by [CONTACT_093]. 
Three acute leukemia patients (3/55 [5%]) administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) 
experienced a Grade 4/life-threatening TEAE (Schedule A, 1/27 patients [4%]; Schedule B, 2/22 
patients [9%]; Schedule D, 0/6 patients [0%]). The Preferred Terms for the Grade [ADDRESS_428617] frequently reported Grade 3 TEAEs were 
fatigue (6/55 patients [11%]) and nausea (4/55 patients [7%]) occurring on Schedules A and B. 
No Grade 3 or higher fatigue, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea occurred on Schedule D.
Serious Adverse Events: Fifteen acute leukemia patients (15/55 [27%]) administered single agent 
Zotiraciclib (TG02) experienced ≥1 SAE (Schedule A, 5/27 patients [19%]; Schedule B, 8/22 
patients [36%]; Schedule D 2/6 patients [33%]). No individual body system had an incidence of 
Abbreviated Title: Ph I/II TMZ+ TG02 astrocytoma
Version Date: 06/01/2020
83SAEs of ≥10%. No significant differences were noted between schedules. Four patients (4/55 
patients [7%]) experienced ≥ 1 serious suspected adverse reaction considered related to study 
drug by [CONTACT_093] (Schedule A, 1/27 patients [4%]; Schedule B, 3/22 patients [14%]; 
Schedule D, (0/6 patients [0%]). 
Patient 03-002 (Schedule A, 10 mg) experienced two occurrences of related nausea 
resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345027] (2 of the occurrences occurred concomitantly with the related nausea). 
Study drug was interrupted. The patient recovered without sequelae from all events. 
Patient 03-018 (Schedule B, 50 mg) experienced related vomiting that resulted in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Study drug was interrupted due to this event.
Patient 01-053 (Schedule B, 150 mg) experienced two occurrences of related fatigue 
which required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The first occurrence of fatigue occurred during Cycle 1 
and was considered a DLT. Study drug was withheld and resumed at the start of Cycle 2 
at 100 mg. The second occurrence of fatigue was in Cycle 2. Study drug was held and 
resumed at the start of Cycle 3 at 100 mg on Days 1-3 and 8-10, a reduced schedule. The 
patient came off study at the end of Cycle 4 for progressive disease. This patient also 
experienced the non-related SAE of respi[INVESTIGATOR_227235]. The patient 
recovered without sequelae from all events.
Patient 03-057 (Schedule B, 150 mg) experienced the related SAE of severe failure to 
thrive, which required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Study drug was interrupted and subsequently 
discontinued the study due to this event. The patient recovered without sequelae from the 
SAE.
Study Drug Discontinuations Due to TEAEs: Seven acute leukemia patients (7/55 [13%]) 
administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) discontinued study drug due to a TEAE (Schedule 
A, 3/27 [11%]; Schedule B, 3/22 patients [14%]; Schedule D 1/6 patients [17%]). No individual 
body system had an incidence of SAEs of ≥10%. No significant differences were noted between 
schedules. The Preferred Terms for these TEAEs were vomiting, pneumonia, maculopapular 
rash, dyspepsia, nausea, fatigue and balance disorder (in one patient) and stomatitis.
Deaths: Five patients (5/55 [9%]) experienced a Grade 5/ fatal TEAE (Schedule A, 3/27 patients 
[11.1%]; Schedule B, 2/22 patients [4.5%]; Schedule D, (0/6 patients [0%]).
Patient 01-026 (Schedule A, 50 mg Zotiraciclib (TG02)) died of pneumonia. The patient

[IP_ADDRESS] Single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) in Multiple Myeloma (MM) Patients
Eighteen multiple myeloma patients administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) were 
evaluated for safety. All patients had discontinued from the study as of the data cut-off date. The 
reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (7/18 patients [39%]), progressive 
disease (7/18 patients [39%]), other (2/18 patients [11%]), adverse event (1/18 patients [6%]) 
and investigator decision (1/18 patients [6%]).  Most frequently reported TEAEs (17/18 patients 
94%) occurred in the System Organ Class of Gastrointestinal Disorders. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs were as follows: diarrhea (10/18 patients, 56%), nausea and fatigue (9/18 
patients, 50%), vomiting and constipation (7/18 patients each, 39%), hypophosphatemia (6/18 
patients, 33%), decreased appetite and hypokalemia (5/18 patients each, 28%). The incidence of 
the TEAEs constipation, hypophosphatemia, decreased appetite and hypokalemia did not differ 
significantly between the dosing schedules. Diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting occurred 
more frequently on Schedule G than Schedule C. Higher doses were administered in Schedule G 
(100 and 150 mg) than in Schedule C (50 and 70 mg). Fatigue and vomiting occurred more 
frequently on Schedule G than Schedule H. A less dose-intense schedule was administered in 
Schedule H (BIW for 3 weeks) than in Schedule G (TIW for 3 weeks) although the number of 
patients in Schedule H is small. 
• Diarrhea: Schedule C, 2 pts [33%]; Schedule G, 6 pts [78%]; Schedule H, 2 pts [67%] 
• Fatigue: Schedule C, 1 pts [17%]; Schedule G, 7 pts [77%]; Schedule H, 1 pt [33%] 
• Nausea: Schedule C, 1 pts [17%]; Schedule G, 6 pts [67%]; Schedule H, 2 pts [67%] 
• Vomiting: Schedule C, 0 pts [0%]; Schedule G, 6 pts [67%]; Schedule H, 1 pt [33%]
Fifteen patients (15/18 patients, 83%) had ≥1 treatment-related TEAEs. One patients (17%) 
experienced grade 5/fatal TEAE and the event was assed as unrelated to the study drug by [CONTACT_1275]. Five patients (28%) had grade 4/life threatening TEAE, including GI hemorrhage, 
thrombocytopenia, neutrophil count decreased, platelet count reduced and hyperuricemia. All 
events were assed as unrelated to the study drug. The most commonly reported grade 3TEAEs 
were hypophosphatemia (28%).
Serious Adverse Events: Five multiple myeloma patients (5/18 patients [28%]) administered 
single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) experienced ≥1 SAE (Schedule C, 4/6 patients [67%]; 
Schedule G, 0/9 patients [0%]; Schedule H, 1/3 patients [33%]). Each of the SAEs (GI 
hemorrhage and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] [in the same patient], fatigue, pneumonia, bone pain and 
pneumonia streptococcal) were experienced by 1 patient each. One patient (1/18 [6%]) 
experienced a serious suspected adverse reaction considered related to study drug by [CONTACT_1275]. Patient 02-058 (Schedule C, 70 mg) experienced Grade 3 related fatigue resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This event was considered a DLT. Study drug was interrupted and then 
discontinued due to this event. The patient recovered without sequelae from the event.
Study Drug Discontinuations Due to TEAEs: Two multiple myeloma patients (2/18 [11%]) 
administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) discontinued study drug due to a TEAE (Schedule 
C, 2/6 patients [33%], Schedules G and H (0/12 patients [0%]). One patient discontinued study 
drug due to fatigue that was assessed by [CONTACT_345086] a DLT. The

due to musculoskeletal bone pain that was assessed by [CONTACT_345087]. The patient recovered with sequela from the event.
Deaths: One multiple myeloma patient (1/18 [16.7%]) administered single agent Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) experienced Grade 5 fatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Patient 05-045 (Schedule C, 50 mg) died of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. The event was assessed as not related to study drug by [CONTACT_345088]’s underlying disease state (i.e., progressive disease).
[IP_ADDRESS] Single Agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients
Only eight CLL patients administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) were evaluated for the 
drug safety. Seven of them (88%) experienced ≥[ADDRESS_428618] frequently reported TEAEs (17/18 patients 94%) occurred in the System Organ Class of 
Gastrointestinal Disorders. The most frequently reported TEAEs were as follows: nausea (6/8 
patients, 75%), diarrhea (4/8 patients, 50%), vomiting, constipation, cough and dyspnea (3/8 
patients each, 38%). Four patients developed treatment –related TEAEs with nausea being the 
most frequently reported treatment –related TEAEs. No dose-related trends were noted due to the 
small number of patients. 
No CLL patients experienced a Grade 5/ fatal TEAE. Three CLL patients (3/8 patients [38%]) 
administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) experienced Grade 4/ Life-Threatening TEAEs. 
Preferred Terms for the Grade 4 TEAEs were sepsis and thrombocytopenia (1 patient), sepsis, 
pneumonia staphylococcal and staphylococcal bacteremia (1 patient), thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia and hypotension. The events of sepsis and thrombocytopenia occurring in the same 
patient were assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_093]. The other Grade 4 TEAEs 
were assessed as unrelated to study drug by [CONTACT_093]. No Grade 3 TEAE was experienced 
by [CONTACT_345089] (1/8 [13%]). 
Serious Adverse Events: Three CLL patients (3/8 [38%]) administered single agent Zotiraciclib 
(TG02) experienced ≥ 1 SAE. The body systems in which the SAEs occurred were Infections 
and Infestations (2/8 patients [25%]), Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (1/8 patients 
[13%]) and Psychiatric Disorders (1/8 patients [13%]). Only the SAE of sepsis was experienced 
by [CONTACT_345089] (2/8 patients [25%]). Two CLL patients (2/8 [25%]) experienced a 
serious suspected adverse reaction considered by [CONTACT_7185]. 
Patient 200-005 (Schedule A, 70 mg) experienced related confusion state resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This event was Grade 2 and did not meet the criteria for a DLT. Study 
drug was interrupted. The patient recovered without sequelae from the event. 
Patient 400-010 (Schedule A, 100 mg) experienced related sepsis, thrombocytopenia and 
febrile neutropenia. Sepsis was considered a DLT. Study drug was interrupted and 
restarted at 70 mg, a reduced dose. 
Study Drug Discontinuations Due to TEAEs: One CLL patient (1/8 [13%]) administered single 
agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. Patient 100-003 discontinued 
study drug due to pneumonia staphylococcal, staphylococcal abscess and staphylococcal 
bacteremia. The patient recovered without sequelae from the events.
Deaths: No CLL subjects administered single agent Zotiraciclib (TG02) died on study.

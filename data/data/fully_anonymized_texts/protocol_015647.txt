*Oropharyngeal cancer patients must be negative for p16, prior to Step 2 registration (randomization); these 
patients must consent to use of the submitted tissue for required HPV analysis . Analysis results are expected in 
approximately 7-10 business days. At that time, patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma can be randomized. S ee 
Section 5.3 for details. Note : If a specimen was previously submitted to the Biospecimen Bank at UCSF for 
determination of HPV status for another RTOG trial  and found to be p16 negative, investigators can forward a 
Specimen Transmittal (ST) Form to the Biospecimen Bank at UCSF requesting that the specimen be sent to [CONTACT_744059]-Naggar for central lab confirmation of p16 negativity. 
 
Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is mandatory for this study . Image-Guided radiation therapy 
(IGRT) is mandatory when using a PTV margin of < 5 mm .  
 
Patient Population :  (See Section 3.0 for Eligibility)

 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 1.1 Treatment of Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)  
 Over 40,000 new cases of HNSCC are diagnosed each year in the [LOCATION_002] (American 
Cancer Society 2010) The majority of these patients present with locally advanced, non-
metastatic disease in which multi-modality therapy may be appropriate. An accepted standard of 
care treatment for locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (LA-HNSCC) is 
concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy with radiation (chemoRT). The updated MACH- NC 
meta-analysis, demonstrated that concomitant chemotherapy plus radiation was associated with 
significant reduction in risk of death compared to radiation alone (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119603] 2009). Several phase III 
studies comparing radiation alone versus concurrent chemoRT for LA-HNSCC also demonstrated 
this effect (Adelstein 2003; Al-Sarraf 1998; Forastiere 2003; Denis 2004). 
 
Altered fractionated radiation has been studied as a way to enhance the efficacy of the 
concurrent chemoRT.  RTOG 90-[ADDRESS_1017520] 
fractionated radiation (Fu 2000). RTOG [ADDRESS_1017521] 
fractionated radiation. The analysis of the phase III randomized RTOG 0129 trial showed that 
patients randomized to receive either accelerated fractionation radiotherapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions 
over 6 weeks) with [ADDRESS_1017522] fractionation radiotherapy (70 Gy in 
35 fractions over 7 weeks) with [ADDRESS_1017523] fractionation schedule, 31% of the patients were unable 
to receive the last and 3rd dose of cisplatin during the 7th week of conventional radiotherapy 
because of toxicity. On the other hand, 88% of patients treated with the accelerated fractionation 
schedule received the [ADDRESS_1017524] 
treatment. 
 
Based upon evidence that EGFR inhibition enhances the cellular response of radiation and 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, RTOG 0522 tested whether the anti-EGFR antibody, cetuximab, 
improves disease-free survival over radiation plus concurrent cisplatin. Initial  report of the results 
of this study showed that the addition of cetuximab to radiation-cisplatin did not improve 
progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) (Ang 2011). Failure of cetuximab to 
improved outcome may be due to insufficient synergistic effect of cetuximab or possibly due to 
inadequate duration of anti-EGFR therapy. No differential effect was observed based upon p16 
status ; however, testing was not possible for nearly half of oropharynx patients.

hile the importance of EGFR in HNSCC has been well established, a direct role of HER2 in 
tumorigenesis and treatment resistance of HNSCC is not clear and poorly understood. HER2 is 
expressed in the range of 0-47% in HNSCC depending on the antibodies used, staining 
conditions, and scoring systems of immunohistochemistry (IHC) [Kearsley 1991; Beckhardt 1995; 
Field 1992; Craven 1992; Ibrahim 1997; Khan 200;Cavalot 2007]. Hou, et al. has shown that 
HER2 expression progressively increased as oral disease progresses from normal mucosa, pre-
malignant lesions to invasive oral SCC (Hou 1992); however, its association with tumor stage, 
locoregional control, and survival as a prognostic marker varies depending on the sample size 
and evaluation methods (Craven 1992; Ibrahim 1997; Khan 2002; Cavalot 2007). In a recent 
study by [CONTACT_744001], et al. (2007), a high membranous HER2 protein expression was an 
independent prognostic factor for disease free survival. To date, HER2 expression has never 
been evaluated as a predictive biomarker of HER2-specific inhibitor therapy in HNSCC. 
 
In addition, there is a strong rationale of dual-targeting of EGFR and HER2. There is evidence 
that heterodimers containing HER2 as a partner is the most potent combination for the receptor 
activity compared to other dimers formed by 4 family members of HER receptors (Arteaga 2003). 
Inhibitory effects of one receptor have shown to be negated by [CONTACT_744002] (Diermeier 2005; Motoyama 2002). The extent of 
EGFR-HER2 and HER2-HER3 heterodimerization in HNSCC is not known; however, potentially 
     11   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017525] of 
lapatinib upon the EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways enhances the cytotoxicity of a concurrent 
cisplatin-radiation regimen as determined by [CONTACT_744003].  Selection of the experimental 
arm of the present study builds upon the RTOG experience, summarized above, and will utilize a 
backbone of accelerated fractionated radiation with 2 concurrent cycles of cisplatin. 
 
1.2 Importance of a Non-HPV-Specific LA-HNSCC Trial 
A recently published retrospective analysis of oropharyngeal cancer patients from RTOG 0129 
identified factors associated with prognosis (survival outcome) [Ang 2010]. Tumor HPV status, as 
determined by [CONTACT_189095] p16, was a strong independent predictor of survival. p16 positive 
patients had the most favorable survival outcome (3-year OS rates of 82.4%), while p16 negative 
patients had the worse outcome (3-year survival rates of 57.1%). An intermediate prognostic 
group also was identified that was p16 positive but had a significant smoking history. Implicit from 
this analysis is that p16 negative (non-HPV) oropharyngeal cancer patients behave much like the 
p16 negative, non-oropharyngeal, head and neck cancer population. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_743956] a growing subset of HNSCC (Sturgis 2007). Nonetheless, 
the non-HPV population still represents the majority of HNSCC cases.  It can be estimated that 
roughly 75% of non-HPV HNSCC cases will have aberrant p16, and therefore, carry a poor 
prognosis (Reed 1996; Gruttgen 2001; Bova 1999). 
 
A clinical trial specifically designed for this poor prognostic population has not been conducted in 
the cooperative oncology group setting but is appropriate for several reasons.  First, the 
molecular pathogenesis of disease of this group is quite distinct from the HPV population.  In 
HPV-related oropharyngeal HNSCC, expression of viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins that inactivate 
p53 and pRb is the known mechanism of carcinogenesis (Rampi[INVESTIGATOR_17174] 2009). In contrast, non-HPV 
HNSCC is thought to occur as a result of a cumulative multistep process of genetic and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_743957]. Second, cooperative 
group oncology clinical trials specifically designed for HPV oropharyngeal cancer are active. 
Finally, the prognosis is unacceptably poor for this non-HPV HNSCC population; significant effort 
is necessary in order to improve their outcome. For all these reasons, a specific study for HPV 
negative patients is necessary in order to make overall progress in the treatment of HNSCC. 
 
As discussed in the following section, lapatinib appears to enhance the effects of chemoradiation. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743958] p16 negative HNSCC patients.  
This study will, therefore, test a proof of biologic principle that a potent inhibitor of the EGFR and 
HER2 signaling pathways can enhance the efficacy of a chemoradiation regimen. In addition, 
there has never been a study evaluating the HER2 status as a predictive marker of HER2 
inhibitors in HNSCC; the proposed study will allow us to evaluate this question, which can only be 
answered in a clinical trial setting with a control arm. The results of this study also are pertinent to 
the design of a future phase III clinical trial and development of novel therapeutic regimens and 
biomarkers. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1017526] demonstrated the prognostic value of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) expression in predicting survival and patterns of relapse 
for LA-HNSCC patients treated with radiation therapy (2002). Recently, Chung, et al. have 
published a validation of EGFR as a predictive biomarker using an IHC quantitative image 
analysis assay (2010). These observations confirm a body of preclinical tumor biology studies 
that have examined the role of EGFR in modulating radiation response.  
 
Other tyrosine kinase receptors in the ErbB family, besides EGFR, may play a role in HNSCC 
tumor progression as well as prognosis --specifically human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]-2 
(HER2/neu) (Khan 2002; Xia 1999; Rait 2003) . In a similar manner, ErbB2 has been reported to 
     12   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 be over-expressed in 15-30% of invasive ductal breast cancer and has been associated with 
increased proliferation, poor clinical outcome, and altered responsiveness to various adjuvant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Nahta 2003). Activation of either EGFR or ErbB2 initiates a series of signaling 
cascades that includes mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K), Akt, and p70S6K. Dual inhibition of EGFR and H ER2/neu may be attractive strategy to 
examine for treatment of LA-HNSCC. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1017527] with the ATP 
binding site of EGFR/ErbB2, resulting in inhibition of autophosphorylation and subsequent 
proliferative signaling (Rusnak 2001). The ErbB family consists of 4 closely related growth factor 
receptor tyrosine kinases: ErbB1 (EGFR/HER), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 
(HER4).  All members of the ErbB family share a common extracellular ligand-binding domain, a 
single membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain (Yarden 2001; 
Atalay 2003). A ligand for ErbB2 has not been identified, while ErbB3 lacks tyrosine kinase 
activity. Ligand binding to EGFR, ErbB3 or ErbB4 induces these inactive monomers to undergo 
an array of homo- or heterodimerization with other members of the ErbB family.  ErbB2 is the 
preferred heterodimeric partner for all ErbB receptors, resulting in a complex that is endocytosed 
at one half to one third the rate of other EGFR dimers (Alroy 2000; Hendriks 2003).  ErbB 
dimerization leads to receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of the tyrosine 
kinase domain. The signaling characteristics of the ErbB family are thought to be strongly 
interdependent. 
1.4.[ADDRESS_1017528]-operative 
lapatinib or placebo and chemoRT for high risk HNSCC is active and currently accruing patients 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Harrington, et al. recently reported the results of a multi-center randomized 
phase II study that examined concurrent chemoRT with or without concurrent and maintenance 
lapatinib for LA-HNSCC (2010). Complete clinical response at 6 months appeared to favor the 
lapatinib arm compared to the placebo arm (53% vs. 36%, odds ratio =2.2 (0.7, 7,0); p value= 
0.1858).  Although also not statistically significant, PFS and OS aligned similarly to demonstrate 
a trend towards favoring the lapatinib arm. Thus, a positive signal that lapatinib enhances the 
effects of chemoRT was observed in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. A retrospective analysis of patients on this 
study for whom p16 status could be determined (n=46), demonstrated that among p16 negative 
patients (n=33), those who received lapatinib plus chemoRT appeared to have improved PFS 
compared to those who received chemoRT alone (HR=0.626 (0.261, 1.506); log rank p value 
0.2963). Unfortunately, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from this analysis due to the 
small size of the subgroup in addition to the retrospective nature of the analysis. However, 
these findings are sufficiently compelling to warrant further examination of this question using a 
larger sampling of this high-risk patient population. Based upon these observations, we 
hypothesize that, due to the disruptive effect of lapatinib upon EGFR and HER2 signaling 
pathways, the addition of concurrent and maintenance lapatinib to a concurrent radiation-
cisplatin regimen will enhance the cytotoxic effect, resulting in an improvement of PFS in high-
risk (non-HPV) LA-HNSCC patients. 
1.4.2  Mechanism of Action 
Lapatinib has been shown to be a potent and selective dual inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2 
tyrosine kinase activity with IC50 values of 10.2 and 9.8 nM, respectively (Rusnak 2001). 
Lapatinib has demonstrated selective growth inhibition of human cell lines (head and neck, 
breast, and gastric) in vitro (IC90 values <2.26 µM or 1313 ng/mL) with no outgrowth observ ed 
up to [ADDRESS_1017529] of tumor cell 
growth and/or apoptosis, even in the presence of saturating concentrations of epi[INVESTIGATOR_47339] (EGF).  Treatment of tumor xenografts resulted in inhibition of activation of EGFR, erbB2, 
Erk1/2, and Akt (Xia 2002). 
 
     13   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
  
1.4.3  Antitumor Activity 
 The ability of lapatinib to inhibit the growth of EGFR-over-expressing cell lines (IC50 <0.16 µM) 
was observed to be equal to that of other EGFR inhibitors being tested in clinical trials (e.g. 
gefitinib/IressaTM or erlotinib/TarcevaTM). With the exception of ErbB4, lapatinib was >300-fold 
more selective towards ErbB2 and EGFR kinase inhibition than to other kinases tested.  
Lapatinib demonstrated potent growth inhibition of human breast ductal (BT474) and head and 
neck (HN5) tumor xenografts in mice.  A dose response inhibition was observed in both models 
receiving lapatinib (30 or 100 mg/kg twice daily orally for 21 days).  Complete inhibition of tumor 
growth was seen in mice receiving 100 mg/kg (Rusnak 2001). 
1.4.4  Signal Transduction  
 Lapatinib has been shown to inhibit Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation (pErk and pAkt) in both 
EGFR and erbB2-expressing cell lines (BT474 and HN5). The ability of lapatinib to inhibit pAkt 
was associated with a 23-fold increase in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis 
compared to control cells.  Similarly, lapatinib treatment of BT474 and HN5 xenografts in mice 
also resulted in inhibition of Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. These results suggested that 
lapatinib treatment of EGFR/erbB2 expressing tumors could lead to inhibition of downstream 
signaling events (Xia 2002). 
 
 A study of human breast cancer cell lines that over-express EGFR or erbB2 (SUM102, 
SUM149, SUM185, and SUM225) reported that treatment with lapatinib resulted in inhibition of 
cell proliferation that was associated with inhibition of Erk phosphorylation. Inhibition of Erk 
phosphorylation also correlated with radiosensitization of cell lines pretreated with lapatinib 
(Zhou 2003). 
1.4.[ADDRESS_1017530] been investigated. A range of genetic toxicity studies 
has been performed in vitro and in vivo.  The significant findings from the toxicology studies are 
summarized below. 
 Following single oral administration, lapatinib was well-tolerated by [CONTACT_295537]-1 mice and 
Wistar Han rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. Treatment-related findings consisted of 
reversible changes in body weight and body weight gain as well as reversible GI effects. 
 A 13-week oral dose ranging pi[INVESTIGATOR_743959] 200 mg/kg/day was generally well tolerated. Microscopic 
changes attributable to treatment with lapatinib were noted in the liver and preputial gland 
of males and large intestines (cecum and colon) of males and females. 
 Administration of lapatinib to rats and dogs for up to 6 months or 9 months resulted 
primarily in exaggerated pharmacologic effects and organ toxicities generally associated 
with degenerative and/or inflammatory epi[INVESTIGATOR_241194] (GI tract and accessory 
digestive organs, skin, mammary gland, liver and prostate). Other treatment-related 
effects included clinical signs, decreased body weight and food consumption, organ 
weight changes and alterations in clinical pathology parameters.  Following the recovery 
period, treatment-related changes were either significantly improved or completely 
reversed. 
 There were no effects on male or female rat gonadal function, mating, fertility or 
pregnancy nor were there any increases in the number or incidence of any malformations 
when rats or rabbits were given lapatinib during the period of major organogenesis. At 
maternally toxic doses (≥ 60 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits), lapatinib treatment was 
associated with growth retardation and developmental variations. 
 In genetic toxicity studies, lapatinib was demonstrated to be non-mutagenic and non-
clastogenic. 
 
1.5 Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes  
This study affords another unique opportunity: to prospectively explore quality of life (QOL) and 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in this disease. Most curative intent, multimodality treatment 
regimens in locally advanced head and neck cancer are associated with significant acute and late 
toxicities. Standard validated QOL measurements used in patients treated for squamous cell 
     14   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017531] demonstrated that a considerable proportion of patients 
report debilitating functional compromise and psychosocial morbidity (Bjordal 2000; Weymuller 
2000; Ringash 2005; Martino 2008; Logemann 2008). There also is a growing body of literature 
supporting a relationship between better QOL with superior treatment outcomes (Siddiqui 2008; 
Karvonen-Gutierrez 2008). To our knowledge, data of this nature is nonexistent among patients 
treated with lapatinib with chemoradiation for non-HPV locally advanced head and neck cancer, 
and this trial would be an ideal mechanism to collect and analyze this subjective, patient-reported 
longitudinal data. Therefore, we will explore the impact of treatment assignment on QOL/PROs 
after initial therapy and during maintenance therapy using validated instruments:  the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) H&N subscale (12 items); the 15-item University of 
Michigan Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale (XeQOLS) and the Performance Status Scale 
for Head and Neck Cancer (PSS-HN) [Ringash 2007; Ringash 2008; Murphy 2007; Henson 2001; 
Rodgers 2009; List 1996; 1999]. These outcomes will be assessed at baseline (pretreatment) and 
at 3, 12, and [ADDRESS_1017532]-H&N subscale, PSS-HN, 
and XeQOLS instruments, will be less favorable for patients undergoing chemoradiation with 
lapatinib relative to chemoradiation and placebo, at 3 months after completion of radiation 
treatment. The current investigation is exploratory, but allows us to explore the relative 
importance of these QOL/PROs in this setting.  The goal of including an exploratory QOL/PROs 
correlative component is to generate estimates of effect sizes (means, standard deviations) that 
will guide the statistical power and effect size estimates for a subsequent phase III trial. 
1.5.1  QOL and PRO Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] The FACT- HN is a multidimensional, patient self-report QOL instrument specifically 
designed and validated for use with head and neck cancer patients. The FACT-HN module 
consists of a 12-item head and neck subscale targeting head and neck related symptoms 
and side effects (Cella 2000; Ringash 2004; Ringash 2005; Ringash 2007; Ringash 2008), 
and can be administered independently from the general FACT-G instrument. High scores 
indicate better QOL and functioning. This tool takes approximately 5-10 minutes to 
complete. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The PSS-HN is a clinician/interviewer administered assessment that focuses on three 
functional areas: Normalcy of Diet, Eating in Public, and Understandability of Speech. The 
score on each of the three subscales ranges from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better 
performance (List 1996; List 1999; List 2000). 
[IP_ADDRESS] The XeQOLS instrument is patient self-report measure that consists of 15 items on a 5-point 
Likert-type scale covering mouth/throat dryness and its impact on four major domains of oral 
health-related quality of life: physical functioning, personal/psychological functioning, social 
functioning, and pain/discomfort issues [Murphy 2007; Henson 2001; Rodgers 2009]. The 
XeQOLS takes the patient approximately [ADDRESS_1017533] role of HER2 in 
tumorigenesis and treatment resistance of HNSCC is not clear and is poorly understood. HER2 is 
expressed in the range of 0- 47% in HNSCC depending on the antibodies used, staining 
conditions and scoring systems of immunohistochemistry (IHC). Hou, et al. have shown that 
HER2 expression progressively increased as oral disease progresses from normal mucosa, pre-
malignant lesions to invasive oral SCC; however, its association with tumor stage, locoregional 
control, and survival as a prognostic marker varies depending on the sample size and evaluation 
methods. In a recent study by [CONTACT_744001], et al., a high membranous HER2 protein expression was 
an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival. To date, HER2 expression has never 
been evaluated as a predictive biomarker of HER2-specific inhibitor therapy in HNSCC. Biologic 
correlative studies of the TryHard study will address these important scientific questions as 
permitted by [CONTACT_744004] a randomized control arm.   
 
Dual-targeting of EGFR and HER2 also provides a strong rationale for the use of lapatinib with 
chemoRT for LA-HNSCC. There is evidence that heterodimers containing HER2 as a partner is 
the most potent combination for the receptor activity compared to other dimers formed by 4 family 
     15   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017534] of uninhibited HER receptor family members. The extent of 
EGFR-HER2 and HER2- HER3 heterodimerization in HNSCC is not known; however, potentially 
heterodimerization may occur and contribute to resistance given EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. Therefore, a dual inhibition using lapatinib warrants further investigation and will be 
examined in the correlative studies. 
1.6.1  HER2 Expression as a Predictive Biomarker of Lapatinib Response 
Since lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of both EGFR and HER2, it is logical to evaluate HER2 protein 
expression and gene amplification in addition to the EGFR analysis and HPV assay (for 
oropharynx only). For this aim, we propose the following: 
 HER2 protein expression determined by [INVESTIGATOR_176216]-guided quantification of IHC stainin g 
(Cavalot 2007); 
 HER2 gene amplification determined by [CONTACT_4656] (Khan 2002). 
1.6.2  EGFR-HER2 Heterodimer Expression as a Predictive Biomarker of Lapatinib Response 
Activation of EGFR involves either homodimerization or heterodimerization between EGFR and 
HER2.The in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) was developed to enable detection of individual 
proteins and protein–protein interactions in cell lines and tissues, specifically paraffin 
embedded tissues (Söderberg 2006; Weibrecht 2010). The approach uses oligonucleotides 
attached to the antibodies against the 2 target proteins, in this case, pEGFR and pHer2. The 
oligonucleotides on the proximity probes when brought into close proximity by [CONTACT_744005], serve as templates for the circularization, which can then be amplified and 
visualized as bright fluorescent RCPs or colometric RCP dots (depending on the type of 
detection). Since each detected protein demierization gives rise to one RCP, the detected 
complexes can be easily enumerated and counted. Tissue PLA has been used to assay for 
HER-family dimerization in tissue samples using the Duolink Kit from Olink Bioscience 
(Uppsala, Sweden). We have also evaluated pEGFR dimerization in head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma and found that this approach can be readily applied to tissue microarray of 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. We propose to use this assay to evaluate 
EGFR homodimerization and EGFR-HER2 heterodimerization on pretreatment tumor samples 
as a potential predictor for lapatinib efficac y. 
1.6.[ADDRESS_1017535] been 
shown to correlate with prognosis in HNSCC (Grandis 1998) and predict for efficacy of EGFR 
targeting, specifically cetuximab in colorectal cancer (Khambata-Ford 2007; Hatakeyama 
2010). Based on th is information, we propose to evaluate the following EGFR ligand expression 
levels as a biomarker predictor of lapatinib response: TGFA, AREG, EREG and HB-EGF 
mRNA levels determined by [CONTACT_937]-PCR (Grandis 1998; Khambata-Ford 2007; Hatakeyama 
2010). In addition, we will measure HB-EGF (one of the EGFR ligands) protein levels in plasma 
samples collected at pre-, end- of-radiation, and post-treatment (Hatakeyama 2010). 
1.6.4  Variant EGFR 497 Arg Allele and EGFR Intron 1<20 CA Repeats as a Prognostic Biomarker of 
Poor Relapse-Free Survival and a Predictive Biomarker of Lapatinib Sensitivity  
Variant EGFR 497 Arg allele and EGFR introl 1<[ADDRESS_1017536] been shown to be a 
prognostic biomarker of poor relapse-free survival (RFS) in HNSCC. However, its role in 
predicting lapatinib sensitivity in unknown in these patients. Since these polymorphisms can be 
readily measured from circulating WBC, we propose to evaluate these allelic variants in 
patients enrolled on this study, both to validate their prognostic significance as well as to 
determine their predictive effect of lapatinib response. The following assays will be performed: 
 Assess EGFR gene polymorphism 497 arginine- to-lysine determined by [CONTACT_954]-RFLP using 
germline DNA collected from pre-treatment PBMC (Zhang 2005); 
 Assess EGFR intron 1 CA repeat polymorphisms determined by [CONTACT_954]-RFLP using germline 
DNA collected from pre-treatment PBMC (Amador 2004). 
1.6.5  Validation of Lysyl Oxidase (LOX) and Gli Family Zinc Finger (Gli1) as Biomarkers of Distant 
Metastasis 
We have previously identified LOX and Gli1 as biomarkers for distant metastasis in HNSCC 
treated with radiation alone on RTOG 90-03 (Le 2009, Chung 2010). The role of these markers 
in HPV negative patients treated with chemoradiation has not been evaluated. We propose to 
validate the role of these biomarkers as predictors for distant metastasis by [CONTACT_744006] 
     16   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 of these proteins in pre-treatment tumor samples (as previously described in Le 2009 and 
Chung 2010). 
1.6.6  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) as a Prognostic Biomarker of Poor RFS and a 
Predictive Biomarker of Lapatinib Resistance 
EMT is a well known process governing invasion and metastasis in epi[INVESTIGATOR_743960]. 
Although several biomarkers have been suggested to reflect the EMT process, one common 
hallmark of EMT is increased vimentin expression in the tumor (Frederick 2007). Recently, 
certain microRNAs, including miR-212, miR-[ADDRESS_1017537] been correlated with poor outcomes (Hatakeyama 
2010; Martello 2010). In this exploratory study, we proposed to measure EMT by [CONTACT_716] 2 
approaches and determine whether the levels of these EMT biomarkers correlate with poor 
RFS and/or lapatinib resistance in the treated patient population. 
 Vimentin expression in pre-treatment tumors determined by [CONTACT_744007] (AQUA) (Frederick 2007); 
 miR-212, miR-103 and miR-200 expression in serum/plasma samples collected at pre- , 
end-of-radiation, and post-treatment (Hatakeyama 2010; Martello 2010).

3.2 Conditions for Patient Ineligibility (9/27/16 )  
3.2.1  Patients with T1 any N or with T2 N1 are ineligible except for specific oropharynx or 
hypopharynx patients as described in Section 3.1.3; 
3.2.2  Patients with simultaneous primaries or bilateral tumors; 
3.2.3  Gross total excision (e.g., by [CONTACT_744000]) of the primary tumor; however, partial removal of 
the tumor to alleviate an impending airway obstruction does not make the patient ineligible. 
3.2.4  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a 
minimum of 3 years; noninvasive cancers (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral 
cavity, or cervix are all permissible) are permitted even if diagnosed and treated < 3 years ago; 
3.2.5  Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different 
cancer is allowable; 
3.2.6 Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation 
therapy fields; 
3.2.7 Primary site of tumor of oral cavity, nasopharynx, sinuses, or salivary glands; 
3.2.8 Initial surgical treatment, excluding diagnostic biopsy of the primary site or nodal sampling of 
neck disease; radical or modified neck dissection is not permitted.

that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation parameters are not required for entry 
into this protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note, 
however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude 
patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this 
protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.  Protocol-specific requirements may also 
exclude immuno-compromised patients.  
 
 
4.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATIONS/MANAGEMENT  
NOTE : This section lists baseline evaluations needed before the initiation of protocol treatment that do 
not affect eligibility.  
4.1 Required Evaluations/Management 
4.1.1  If the patient consents to participate in the quality of life (QOL) component of the study, sites 
are required to administer the baseline QOL and PRO assessments prior to the start of protocol 
treatment: the P SS-HN, FACT-HN, and XeQOLS. 
 
4.2 Highly Recommended Evaluations/Management 
The following pre-treatment evaluations/interventions are not required but are highly recommended. 
4.2.1 Dental evaluation and if applicable, prophylaxis, within 84 calendar days prior to the start of 
treatment (see Appendix VII, Dental Management); 
4.2.2 Whole body PET/CT scan within 42 calendar days prior to the start of treatment;  
4.2.3 Baseline audiogram within 84 calendar days prior to the start of treatment; 
4.2.4 Assessment of swallowing (dysphagia) within 28 calendar days prior to the start of treatment; 
4.2.5 Nutritional evaluation for a prophylactic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement any time prior to the

did not have prophylactic PEG placement prior to treatment required placement of PEG during 
treatment 
 
 
5.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES (8/13/15) 
Note: This is a limited institution study; see participating institutions on the RTOG web site. 
 
IGRT is mandatory when using reduced PTV margins (<5 mm). If the institution is not head and 
neck IGRT credentialed, contact [CONTACT_744010]/RTQA Credentialing at [PHONE_15512]. 
 
5.1 Regulatory Pre-Registration Requirements (10/3/13)  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1017545] 
maintain an “active” investigator registration status through the annual submission of a 
complete investigator registration packet (FDA Form 1572 with original signature, current CV, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form with signature, and Financial Disclosure Form with 
original signature) to the Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP, DCTD, NCI. 
 
Each investigator or group of investigators at a participating site must obtain IRB approval for 
this protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the RTOG 
Headquarters (FAX [PHONE_15513]) or e-mail them to [EMAIL_14194] .  The 
following study-related regulatory documentation is required:  
 Institutional Qualifying Questionnaire with RTOG approval for participation; 
 RT Credentialing for IMRT and IGRT; 
 IRB/REB initial approval letter; 
     19   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
  IRB/REB approved consent (English and native language versions*) ; *Note: Institutions 
with a large number of patients whose primary language is not English must provide 
certification/verification of IRB/REB consent translation to RTOG Headquarters 
(described below in Section [IP_ADDRESS]); 
 IRB/REB assurance number including renewal information, as appropriate; 
 Study Agent Shipment Form (SASF) [available on the RTOG web site, www.rtog.org , 
under protocol-specific materials/regulatory resources ]; 
 All subsequent amendment and annual approvals; 
 All Regulatory submissions must also include a completed IRB certification Form as a 
cover sheet. 
 Note : In the event of an amendment of this protocol, sites should submit their amended 
consent form to RTOG Regulatory for approval prior to IRB/REB submission. Sites can submit 
the consent form with tracked changes to [EMAIL_14194]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Translation of documents is critical. The institution is responsible for all translation costs. All 
regulatory documents, including the IRB/REB approved consent, must be provided in 
English and in the native language. Certification of the translation is optimal but due to the 
prohibitive costs involved RTOG will accept, at a minimum, a verified translation. A verified 
translation consists of the actual REB approved consent document in English and in the 
native language, along with a cover letter on organizational/letterhead stationer y that 
includes the professional title, credentials, and signature [CONTACT_744058] a neutral third party. The 
professional title and credentials of the neutral third party translator must be specified as 
well. 
5.1.2 Pre-Registration Requirements for the Initial Shipment of Lapatinib:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Participating Institutions : 
All pre-registration requirements must be met before registering the first case. Institutions 
must electronically complete (versus hand write) a Study Agent Shipment Form (SASF) , 
which is available on the RTOG web site, www.rtog.org , under protocol-specific 
materials/regulatory resources . Institutions must submit the SASF to RTOG Headquarters by 
[CONTACT_62872]
X 215- 940-8919 or e-mail: [EMAIL_14194]  as soon as the individual 
responsible for the study agent has been identified.  
 
5.2 Pre-Registration Requirement: Central Pathology Review 
 Central pathology review for eligibility is required prior to registration. Pathology materials and a 
pathology report must be submitted to the Central Pathology Reviewer. (See Section 10.2 .)  
 
5.3 Registration (9/27/16) 
5.3.1 Summary of Procedures 
This study incorporates a two-step registration process for oropharyngeal patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS] All patients can be registered after completing the Eligibility Checklist, Step [ADDRESS_1017546], Step 2 via online registration. 
 
See Section 5.3.2 online for registration instructions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Oropharyngeal carcinoma patients must consent to submit tissue for HPV analysis; see 
Section 10.[ADDRESS_1017547]. Adel El-
Naggar for HPV analysis. The results of the HPV analysis are expected in approximately 7-
10 business days, and RTOG Headquarters will inform sites by e-mail of the completion of 
the HPV analysis. At this point, oropharyngeal carcinoma patients may be randomized; sites 
must complete the Eligibility Checklist, Step 2 via online registration.  
  
 Note : If a specimen was previously submitted to the Biospecimen Bank at UCSF for 
determination of HPV status for another RTOG trial and found to be p16 negative, 
investigators can forward a Specimen Transmittal (ST) Form to the Biospecimen Bank at 
UCSF requesting that the specimen be sent to [CONTACT_492205]-Naggar for central lab confirmation of 
p16 negativity. 
     20   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017548]: 
 The investigator and research staff must have completed Human Subjects Training and 
been issued a certificate (Training is available via 
http://phrp.nihtraining.com/users/login.php ). 
 A representative from the institution must complete the Password Authorization Form  
(http://www.rtog.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=-BXerpBu5AQ%3d&tabid=219 ) and fax it to 
[PHONE_4520].  RTOG Headquarters requires 3-4 days to process requests and issue user 
names/passwords to institutions. 
 
 An institution can register the patient by [CONTACT_744011] ( http://www.rtog.org ), 
going to “Data Center Logon" and selecting the link for new patient registrations.  The system 
triggers a program to verify that all regulatory requirements (OHRP assurance, IRB approval) 
have been met by [CONTACT_8236]. The registration screens begin by [CONTACT_744012], the identification of the person who completed the 
checklist, whether the patient was found to be eligible on the basis of the checklist, and the 
date the study-specific informed consent form was signed. 
 
 Once the system has verified that the patient is eligible and that the institution has met 
regulatory requirements, it assigns a patient-specific case number. The system then moves to a 
screen that confirms that the patient has been successfully enrolled.  This screen can be 
printed so that the registering site will have a copy of the registration for the patient’s record.  
Two e-mails are generated and sent to the registering site:  the Confirmation of Eligibility and 
the patient-specific calendar. The system creates a case file in the study’s database at the 
DMC (Data Management Center) and generates a data submission calendar listing all data 
forms, images, and reports and the dates on which they are due.  
 
 If the patient is ineligible or the institution has not met regulatory requirements, the system 
switches to a screen that includes a brief explanation for the failure to register the patient.  This 
screen can be printed. 
 
 Institutions can contact [CONTACT_744013]: 
[EMAIL_9988] . 
 
 In the event that the RTOG web registration site is not accessible, participating sites can 
contact [CONTACT_744013]: [EMAIL_9988]  or call 
RTOG Headquarters, at ([PHONE_15514], Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET.  
  
 
6.0 RADIATION THERAPY 
Note: All participating institutions will be credentialed for IMRT prior to registering patients to the 
study. Rapid review of cases is not required prior to patient enrollment. 
 
Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is mandatory for this study. Image-Guided 
Radiation Therapy (IGRT) is mandatory when using a PTV margin of < [ADDRESS_1017549] begin within 14 calendar days after randomization.  
 
6.1 Dose Specifications (8/5/14) 
IMRT will be given in [ADDRESS_1017550] a 6-hour interfraction interval, on one of the 
weekdays.  
 
     21   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017551] be delivered using one single plan; concomitant boost techniques using a 
separate IMRT plans are not allowed. Sites must have completed pre-registration requirements 
for IMRT (and IGRT, if using reduced margins) credentialing prior to enrolling patients on trial. 
 
Missed treatments due to holidays or logistic reasons can be compensated by [CONTACT_453770], with a minimum inter-fraction interval of 6 hours, or by [CONTACT_744014]. 
6.1.1  The primary tumor and involved nodes will be encompassed by [CONTACT_320736]-High Dose 
(PTV_7000) and will receive a dose of 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions (see Section 6.1.3 for details of 
the prescription for the PTV_7000).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Regional lymph nodes that are considered to be at high risk of microscopic disease, PTV 
Intermediary (PTV_5950-6300), may be treated to a dose in the range of 59.5 Gy to 63 Gy in 
1.7 Gy to  1.8 Gy per fraction, respectively. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lower-risk targets, such as neck nodal levels that are not first echelon nodes and are not 
adjacent to levels containing grossly involved nodes, will be encompassed by [CONTACT_64992]-Elective 
Dose (PTV_5600) and will receive a dose of [ADDRESS_1017552] be normalized such that 95% of the volume of the PTV_7000 is covered with 
prescription dose of 70 Gy.  
Additionally: 
 At 1 cc PTV _7000 volume on the DVH curve, the dose should not be >110% of the 
prescribed dose of 70 Gy. 
 No volume > 0.03 cc within the PTV_7000 volume on the DVH curve should receive a 
dose < 95% of the prescribed dose. 
 No more than 1 cc of the tissue outside the PTVs should receive >105% of the prescribed 
dose to PTV_7000. 
 
Dose should be reported with inhomogeneity corrections.  
 
6.2 Technical Factors   
6.2.1  Treatment Planning/Delivery 
Megavoltage energy photon beam irradiation with a photon beam of > 4 MV is required. Any 
treatment planning and delivery system that has been credentialed for head and neck IMRT for 
previous RTOG trials is acceptable. 
6.2.2  Image Guidance for IGRT When Using Reduced Margins 
Daily image guidance of IMRT may be achieved using any one or more of the following 
techniques: 
 Orthogonal kilovoltage (KV) images, e.g. ExacTrac; 
 Linear-accelerator mounted kV and MV  conebeam CT images; 
 Linear-accelerator mounted MV CT images (e.g., Tomotherapy). 
[IP_ADDRESS] The institution’s procedure for registering daily treatment imaging datasets with a reference 
dataset should comply with the following recommendations: 
 Region- of-Interest (ROI) or “clip box” for fusion should be set to encompass the high 
dose PTV and adjacent spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]; if the supraclavicular region is a part of the target 
volume the ROI should extend to the C6 level; 
 If the fusion software allows the user to create an irregular ROI (e.g. ExacTrac), 
treatment room objects seen on in-room x-rays should be excluded from the 
registration; 
     22   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
  Both manual (e.g. based on bony anatomy) and automatic (e.g. based on mutual 
information) types of registration can be used; the result of the fusion must be visually 
checked for the alignment of the bony anatomy, such as vertebral bodies and 
applicable soft tissue structures (e.g. optic nerves and/or optic chiasm). 
 Following the registration, the translational and (if the appropriate technology is 
available) rotational corrections should be applied to the treatment couch. If all the 
variances are <2.5 mm (this typi[INVESTIGATOR_445152]), the treatment can proceed without correction (however, the physician/team 
may elect to perform adjustments even for a variance <2.5 mm). If one or more 
corrections are 2.5 to 5 mm, adjustment is necessary prior to treatment; however, re-
imaging is not mandatory. If one or more of the corrections are >[ADDRESS_1017553] be repeated in addition to performing table/positioning adjustments. However, 
the use of numerous repeat IGRT studies should be avoided (see next section). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Radiation Dose to the Patient from IGRT 
Estimates of patient doses per imaging study for various imaging systems vary considerably. 
The doses are in the range of 1 mGy for Cyberknife’s and BrainLab’s ExacTrac planar kV-
systems. The doses from helical MV CT scan on a Tomotherapy unit were estimated to be in 
range from [ADDRESS_1017554] are in the range of 10 cGy for a pelvis study to 6 cGy for a head and neck study. Thus, 
the doses for 3D imaging systems are in the range from 1 to 6 cGy for head and neck 
imaging and can contribute from 0.5 to 3% to the daily dose of 2.[ADDRESS_1017555] any clinical relevance to the patient. However, the 
imaging dose to the patient may become significant if repeated studies are done for patients 
with severe set up problems (e.g., requiring frequent corrections of more than 5 mm). It is 
recommended that patients demonstrating severe set up problems during the first [ADDRESS_1017556] scan is mandatory for defining target volumes and normal organ at 
risk. The “planning” CT scan will be done with and without contrast, the one with no contrast is 
intended for use in heterogeneity corrected IMRT planning. The “structuring” scan with contrast 
is fused to the planning scan for the purposes of structure definition and so that the major 
vessels of the neck are easily visualized.  An institution may elect to use the “structuring” scan 
as the “planning” scan. CT scan thickness should be 0.[ADDRESS_1017557] scans and/or MRI may be 
fused with the planning CT scan. 
 
6.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes (8/13/15) 
The primary tumor and involved nodes will be encompassed by [CONTACT_320736]_7000 and will receive 2 
Gy per fractions, while subclinical disease sites will be encompassed by [CONTACT_64992]_5600 which will 
receive 1.6 Gy per fraction. The total doses will thus be 70 Gy and 56 Gy in 35 fractions, 
respectively. Regional lymph node areas considered to be at high risk for microscopic disease, 
PTV_5950-6300, may be treated to dose in the range of 59.5 - 63 Gy at 1.7-1.8 Gy per fractions. 
 
The treatment plan used for each patient will be based on an analysis of the volumetric dose,   
including dose-volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTV (CTV with a 5 mm margin) and 
critical normal structures. 
 
An “inverse” planning with computerized optimization should be used. 
 
     23   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 Structures marked “required” in the table below must  be contoured and submitted for review.  
Resubmission of data may be required if labeling of structures does not conform to the 
standard DICOM name [CONTACT_629568].

6.4.1  Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) represents the region judged to contain gross primary tumor or 
involved node(s) based on clinical and endoscopic examinations, CT scan, and, when 
applicable, other imaging techniques. Grossly positive lymph nodes are defined as any lymph 
nodes > 1 cm or nodes with a necrotic center. 
6.4.2  Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is defined as the GTV plus areas considered at risk for containing 
microscopic disease delineated by [CONTACT_1963]. CTV_7000 represents GTV plus a 
margin of generally 1 cm, and CTV_5600 represents CTV _7000 with a margin of 1 cm and 
nodal regions to receive elective irradiation.  
 
When the tumor is infiltrative (endophytic) or when the border is ill defined, it might be desirable 
to deliver an intermediate dose (e.g. 59.5-63 Gy) to a volume (CTV _5950 -6300) that is slightly 
larger than CTV_7000. The CTV margins can be narrower when GTV is in the proximity of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_453696]. CTV should be limited by [CONTACT_744015], and external body contours.  
 
The guidelines for CT based delineation of lymph node levels for node negative patients can be 
found at the RTOG web site: http://www.rtog.org/CoreLab/ContouringAtlases/HNAtlases.aspx . 
For patients wi th positive neck nodes, the proposal by [CONTACT_744016] (2006) for the delineation of the 
nodal CTV in the node-positive neck, may be used. 
6.4.3  Planning Target Volume (PTV_7000, PTV_5950- 6300 , and PTV_5600) represents an 
additional margin around CTV _7000 , CTV _5950-6300, and CTV_5600 to compensate for the 
variability of treatment set-up and internal organ motion.  A minimum margin of 0.[ADDRESS_1017558] or other critical normal tissues. In such situations, the 
margin can be reduced judiciously.  
 
For those institutions using daily IGRT and that are credentialed to use IGRT for margin 
reduction, a minimum of 3 mm may be used for the CTV to PTV expansion. If IGRT is used 
without margin reduction, a minimum of 5 mm margin is required for the expansion of CTV to 
PTV. 
 
When expansion of a CTV results in a PTV that extends beyond the patient’s body surface, the 
PTV should be constrained to [ADDRESS_1017559] under the skin surface. The 
PTV does not need to be constrained underneath the bolus. 
6.4.4  The density corrected dose distributions shall be calculated, and the dose prescription is to be 
based on a dose distribution corrected for heterogeneities. 
 
6.5 Critical Structures (8/5/14) 
6.5.1  Management of the Low Neck/Supraclavicular Region (Match versus No Match) 
It is recognized that comprehensive head and neck irradiation incorporating IMRT can be done 
in several ways, any of which is permitted for this study. Patient-specific QA measurements are 
required for all IMRT treatments.  When a field “match” technique is used for treating the lower 
     25   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 neck, patient-specific measurements should include a verification of the dose coverage in the 
gap region for each patient. 
1. Match: The upper cervical lymphatics and primary tumor bed are treated with IMRT. The 
lower cervical lymphatics and supraclavicular region are treated with a single AP (or 
occasionally APPA for larger patients with posterior neck at high risk) non-IMRT technique. 
The latter non-IMRT field(s) is matched to the upper neck IMRT fields. This technique 
requires comprehensive mid-line spi[INVESTIGATOR_743963]. This 
technique also allows for a simultaneous blocking of portions of the larynx, hypopharynx, 
and cervical esophagus in the lower neck fields. Matching 2 IMRT plans is allowed. 
2. No Match: The entire clinical target volume (CTV) [upper and lower neck and primary tumor 
bed] is irradiated with IMRT. There is no match line between upper and lower portions of 
the regions at risk. In this technique, limiting radiotherapy dose to organs at risk (OARs), 
e.g., the cervical esophagus, is entirely achieved by [CONTACT_744017]. 
6.5.2  Definitions of Normal Tissues/Organs at Risk (OARs) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406] : The cord begins at the cranial-cervical junction (i.e. the top of the C1 vertebral 
body). Superior to this is brainstem and inferior to this is cord. The inferior border of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_357319] T3-4 (i.e., just below the lowest slice level that has PTV on it). 
The spi[INVESTIGATOR_306396]. In addition, 
however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) spi[INVESTIGATOR_181589]. The PRV cord = spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232] + 5 mm in each dimension. This is irrespective of the use of IGRT for margin 
reduction. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Brainstem:  The inferior most portion of the brainstem is at the cranial-cervical junction where 
it meets the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. For the purposes of this study, the superior most portion of the 
brainstem is approximately at the level of the top of the posterior clinoid process. The 
brainstem shall be defined based on the treatment planning CT scan.  In addition, however, 
a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) brainstem shall be defined. The PRV brainstem = brainstem 
+ 5 mm in each dimension. This is irrespective of the use IGRT for margin reduction. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lips and Oral Cavity:  These should be contoured as 2 separate structures as the goal is to 
keep the lip dose much lower than the oral cavity dose. The definition of lips is self 
explanatory. The oral cavity will be defined as a composite structure consisting of the 
anterior one half to two thirds of the oral tongue/floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and palate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Parotid Glands:  Parotid glands are defined based on the treatment planning CT scan. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharynx:  This is defined as the “uninvolved” posterior pharyngeal wall plus adjacent 
constrictor muscles. This extends from the superior constrictor region (the inferior pterygoid 
plates level) to the cricopharyngeal inlet (posterior cricoid cartilage level). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cervical Esophagus:  This is defined as a tubular structure that starts at the bottom of 
pharynx and extends to the thoracic inlet. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Glottic/Supraglottic Larynx (GSL ): The GSL begins just inferior to the hyoid bone and 
extends to the cricoid cartilage inferiorly and extends from the anterior commissure to 
include the arytenoids. This includes the infrahyoid but not suprahyoid epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mandible:  The mandible includes the entire bony structure from TMJ through the symphysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets:  This tissue is located between the skull base and 
thoracic inlet that is not included in either the target volumes or the normal tissues described 
above.    
6.5.3  In cases of weight loss >10%, or significant shrinkage of lymphadenopathy during therapy, it is 
recommended that the immobilization mask be adjusted or remade and a new plan be 
performed to assess the dose distributions with the current anatomy. Whether a new IMRT plan 
will be generated is at the discretion of the treating physician. If a new plan is made, the targets 
should be the same as those used for the initial plan. The new CT contour should be used for 
IGRT image registration with the new plan. 
6.5.4  Doses to Normal Structures 
[IP_ADDRESS] Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]:  The cord should not exceed 48 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc 
(approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The PRV spi[INVESTIGATOR_62402] [ADDRESS_1017560] priority. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Brainstem:  The PRV brainstem should not exceed 52 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc 
(approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). In treatment planning, the PRV brainstem should be 
     26   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017561] but more priority than the other critical structures listed 
below.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose should be <20 Gy.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Oral Cavity:  Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose should be <30 Gy for 
the non-involved oral cavity. Efforts should also be made to avoid hot spots (>60 Gy) within 
the non-involved oral cavity. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Parotid Glands:  In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than the other. The 
treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid gland to receive a mean dose of 
<26 Gy.   
 
Contralateral submandibular gland:  If contralateral level I is not a target, aim to reduce mean 
contralateral submandibular gland to <39 Gy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharynx:  Reduce the dose as much as possible. Some recommended (but not mandatory) 
treatment goals include: 1) No more than 33% of the pharynx exceeds 50 Gy; 2) Mean dose 
<45 Gy; 3) No more than 15% of the pharynx exceeds 60 Gy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cervical Esophagus:  Reduce the dose as much as possible.  Some recommended (but 
treatment goals include: Mean dose <30 Gy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Glottic and Supraglottic larynx (GSL):  Reduce the dose as much as possible. The glottic 
larynx mean dose is recommended to be <20 Gy. If whole-neck IMRT is used, under-dosage 
of PTV_5950-6300 and PTV_5600 adjacent to the glottic larynx will be limited to <10% 
receiving <95% prescribed dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mandible:  Reduce the dose as much as possible. Hot spots within the mandible should be 
avoided. It is recommended that maximum dose within the mandible be <66 Gy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets:  No more than 1cc of unspecified tissue outside the 
targets can receive [ADDRESS_1017562]

6.6 Documentation Requirements for IMRT ( 9/27/12 ) 
 Pre-treatment Radiation therapy planning CT scan (see Section 6.3.2); 
 If IGRT is not used, then orthogonal images that localize the isocenter placement of 
IMRT are required. This information should be archived by [CONTACT_691612], so it 
can be made available for possible future review. 
 
6.7 Compliance Criteria (8/13/15) 
Treatment breaks must be clearly indicated in the treatment record along with the reason(s) for 
the treatment break(s). Treatment breaks, if necessary, ideally should not exceed 5 treatment 
days at a time and 10 treatment days total. Treatment breaks should be allowed only for 
resolution of severe acute toxicity and/or for intercurrent illness and not for social or logistical 
reasons. Any treatment break(s) exceeding 2 treatment days for reasons other than 
toxicity/illness will be considered a protocol deviation. 
 
All treatment plans are to be normalized to provide exactly 95% volume coverage of the 
PTV_7000 with 70 Gy.

6.8 R.T. Quality Assurance Reviews ( 8/13/15 ) 
 The Radiation Oncology Co-Chair, George Shenouda, MD, will perform RT Quality Assurance 
Review s. These reviews will be ongoing and performed remotely. RT Quality Assurance reviews 
will be facilitated by [CONTACT_744010]/RTQA. 
 
6.9 Radiation Therapy Adverse Events 
Grade 3-4 (CTCAE, v. 4) therapy-induced mucositis and/or dysphagia, which are enhanced by 
[CONTACT_181615], are expected to develop in about two thirds of patients. Other common radiation 
adverse events include: fatigue, weight loss, regional alopecia, xerostomia, hoarseness, transient 
ear discomfort, dysgeusia, and skin erythema and desquamation within the treatment fields. 
 
Less common long-term treatment adverse events include: hypothyroidism, loss of hearing, and 
chronic swallowing dysfunction requiring permanent feeding tube, and cervical fibrosis. Much less 
common radiation adverse events include: mandibular osteoradionecrosis (< 5% incidence with 
attention to the dental recommendations provided in Appendix VII), and cervical myelopathy 
(<1% with restriction of spi[INVESTIGATOR_181586] ≤ 45 Gy). 
  
6.[ADDRESS_1017564] be met for RTOG to consider breaking the treatment code.  
 
 During business hours (8:30 AM to 5 PM ET), call RTOG Headquarters at [PHONE_4521] and ask 
to speak to the Supporting Study Statistician. For after hours, weekends, and holidays, call 215-
459-3576. 
 
7.2 Treatment (2/2/16) 
7.2.1  Cisplatin :  
Weeks 2-7 with concurrent radiation therapy and lapatinib/placebo : Patients will receive 
cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, administered intravenously on days 8 and 29 of the treatment course 
(Note: cisplatin given within 24 hours of days 8 and 29, e.g. due to holidays, is acceptable). 
Weekends count as days. Cisplatin can be given before or after the fraction of radiation that is 
given on the same day.  If radiation is held for more than 2 days (for any reason), cisplatin may 
be held as well until radiation therapy resumes. 
 
See Section 7.6 .1 for dose modification for weight loss.  Use the actual body weight for all 
patients. Dose modification for obesity is not recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS] High dose cisplatin is a highly emetogenic regimen with significant incidence of delayed 
nausea and vomiting. Institutional guidelines for highly emetogenic regimens should be 
followed. In the absence of such guidelines: 
 For acute nausea and vomiting, premedication should include a 5-HT3 antagonist, 
such as granisetron 1 mg iv.; ondansetron, up to 16 mg iv; or palonosetron, 0.25 mg 
     29   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 iv.; plus a corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, up to 20 mg iv.. Palonosetron has 
a longer half life (40h) than the first generation 5HT3 antagonists. 
 Breakthrough nausea and vomiting should be managed at the discretion of the 
medical or radiation oncologist. Delayed nausea and vomiting (greater than 24 hours 
after chemotherapy administration) may be managed by [CONTACT_306414][INVESTIGATOR_306393]. Potential delayed nausea 
regimens include: 
1. The NK-[ADDRESS_1017565], aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (125 mg p.o.), may be added for prevention of 
delayed emesis on the day of cisplatin administration and for 2 consecutive days 
thereafter (80 mg, 80 mg p.o.), with a corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone on 
days 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1017566] (e.g. granisetron, ondansetron) may be given for 3 days, only if 
palonosetron was not given prior to chemotherapy.  Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (115 mg iv. x 
1) may be used instead of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_508868] 1, 30 minutes before cisplatin; if 
used, fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_743964] 2 and 3, and 
dexamethasone will be given as described above. 
2. Delayed emesis also may be managed by [CONTACT_744018] 8 mg 
bid x 2 days, followed by [CONTACT_149618] 4 mg bid x 2 days, beginning day after 
chemotherapy; oral metoclopramide 0.5 mg/kg (usually 20-40 mg) in addition qid 
x 2-4 days; 5HT3 antagonist (e.g. granisetron, ondansetron) may be given for [ADDRESS_1017567] if aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_743965] 4 days. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must receive vigorous hydration and diuresis. A suggested regimen is pre- 
hydration with a 1 liter of D5N S over 2-4 hours and mannitol, 12.5 g iv. bolus immediately 
prior to cisplatin. Then cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, in [ADDRESS_1017568] be corrected prior to cisplatin administration. Should extravasation occur, the treating 
physician should follow institutional guidelines for management. 
 
Overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_743966], if it is allowed 
by [CONTACT_102]'s insurance company. Additional iv. hydration and BUN/creatinine check 
should be strongly considered later in the week after cisplatin administration, in order to 
prevent dehydration and severe fluid/electrolyte imbalance. 
7.2.2  Lapatinib/Placebo : (1/16/14)  
Note: See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for lapatinib/placebo feeding tube administration. See Section 7.6.2 
for lapatinib/placebo dose modifications. 
 
Week 1 : Starting 7 calendar days prior to radiation, patients will take 6 lapatinib/placebo tablets 
(1500 mg) once daily, 7 days a week, by [CONTACT_744019] (either 
1 hour before or 1 hour after meals). Lapatinib/placebo tablets are not to be crushed. 
 
Weeks 2-7 : Concurrent with radiation and cisplatin, patients will take 6 lapatinib/placebo tablets  
(1500 mg) once daily, 7 days a week, by [CONTACT_744019] (either 
1 hour before or 1 hour after meals). Lapatinib/placebo tablets are not to be crushed. 
 
After Concurrent Treatment (Maintenance) : After completion of radiation, patients will continue 
lapatinib/placebo 6 tablets (1500 mg) once daily, 7 days a week, by [CONTACT_744020] (either 1 hour before or 1 hour after meals) for 3 months. 
 
Patient Diary : Patients will be asked to document daily lapatinib/placebo on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_743967], which will be collected by [CONTACT_633736]. Institutions will submit the DP form to RTOG at the end of concurrent treatment 
and every month during maintenance treatment (see Sections 11.2.3 and 12.1). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recommended Dosing Procedure for Slurry Preparation of Lapatinib/Placebo Water 
Suspension 
 Lapatinib tablets are NOT to be crushed. 
 Place 120 mL (4 oz) of water in a glass container, then add 6 lapatinib/placebo tablets 
to the container.  Cover the container, let it stand for 5 minutes, and then stir the 
     30   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 mixture intermittently for 10 minutes or until it is fully dispersed.  Stir the mixture for 5 
seconds then administer. Rinse the container with a 2 oz aliquot of water and repeat 
the administration process. This completes the administration process (total of 6 oz of 
liquid is dispensed). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recommended Dosing Procedure for Slurry Preparation of Lapatinib/Placebo Kool-Aid 
Suspension 
 Prepare Lemonade or Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_117754]-Aid as directed on the package. Place 2 or 4 oz 
of Kool-Aid in a glass container, then add 6 lapatinib/placebo tablets to the container. Cover 
the container, let it stand for 5 minutes, and then stir the mixture intermittently for 10 minutes 
or until it is fully dispersed.  Stir the mixture for 5 seconds then administer.  Rinse the 
container with a 2 oz aliquot of water and repeat the administration process. This completes 
the administration process (total of 4-6 oz of liquid is dispensed). 
 
7.3 Cisplatin (Cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum, DDP) 
Refer to the package insert for additional information 
7.3.1  Formulation: Each vial contains [ADDRESS_1017569] pH. 
7.3.2 Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of DDP has not been clearly elucidated; 
however, preliminary studies have indicated that the most likely mechanism of antitumor action 
of this drug resides in its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis and to a lesser degree, RNA and 
protein synthesis. It has also been shown that DDP binds to DNA and produces inter-strand 
cross-links. Also DDP is not phase-sensitive and its cytotoxicity is similar in all phases of the 
cell cycle. 
7.3.3 Administration: Intravenous 
7.3.4  Storage and Stability: Reconstituted solution of cisplatin is stable for 20 hours when stored at 
27°C and should be protected from light if not used within [ADDRESS_1017570] with aluminum needles, 
producing a black precipi[INVESTIGATOR_160591] 30 minutes. 
7.3.5  Adverse Events: The following adverse events are anticipated:  
 Hematologic: Myelosuppression, often with delayed erythrosuppression; rarely, acute 
leukemia; 
 Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, loss of taste;  
 
  
 Renal: Elevation of BUN, creatinine and impairment of endogenous creatinine clearance, 
as well as renal tubular damage which appears to be transient); hyperuricemia, much 
more severe and prolonged adverse events have been observed in patients with 
abnormal or obstructed urinary excretory tracts; 
 Hepatic: Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia; 
 Neurologic: Restlessness, involuntary movements, loss of coordination, seizures , 
peripheral neuropathy;  
 Allergic: Flushing, bronchoconstriction, tachycardia, hypotension; 
 Other: Ototoxicity (with hearing loss which initially is in the high-frequency range, as well 
as tinnitus); muscle cramps; weakness. 
7.3.6  Supply: Cisplatin is commercially available.  
  
7.4 Lapatinib/Placebo (Tykerb®; GW5 [ZIP_CODE])  IND 115409 (8/5/14) 
This study will be conducted under an IND to be held by [CONTACT_744021]. Lapatinib and placebo will be supplied to patients on study free of charge. 
Participating institutions can access t he Lapatinib Investigator Brochure on the RTOG web site 
(password protected).  
7.4.1 Chemical Name: N- {3-Chloro-4-[(3-fluorobenzyl)oxy]phenyl}-6- [5-({[2-
(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)-2 furyl]-4-quinazolinamine 
7.4.2 Mode of Action: Dual inhibitor of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR or ErbB1) and ErbB2 
tyrosine kinases. 
7.4.3 How Supplied: Lapatinib and placebo are supplied as 250 mg oval, biconvex, orange film-
coated tablets with one side plain and the opposite side debossed with FG HLS.  The lapatinib 
     31   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 tablets contain 410 mg of lapatinib Ditosylate Monohydrate, equivalent to 250 mg lapatinib free 
base per tablet.  The tablets are packaged into HDPE bottles with child-resistant closures. 
Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_660399]: Microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium starch 
glycolate, and magnesium stearate. The film-coat contains: Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 
titanium dioxide, triacetin/glycerol triacetate, and yellow iron oxide. Each bottle of lapatinib or 
placebo contains 90 tablets. 
7.4.4 Administration: Oral on an empty stomach (either 1 hour before or 1 hour after meals). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Medications 
 See Appendix VI. 
7.4.5 Storage and Stability: The intact bottles should be stored at controlled room temperature 
(15°C-30°C). Shelf life surveillance studies of the intact bottle are on-going.  Current data 
indicates lapatinib is stable for at least 2 years at controlled room temperature (15°C - 30°C). 
7.4.6 Lapatinib Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac:  Cardiovascular events have been seen in patient s taking other compounds that 
inhibit ErbB2 when used in combination with or following anthracyclines, and interstitial 
pneumonitis has been reported in patients taking compounds that inhibit ErbB1. See 
Sections 7.7.1 and 7.7.2 for management guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity:  Hepatobiliary events have been seen in patients taking lapatinib and other 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors. See Section 7. 7.3 for management guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dermatologic 
Significant skin adverse events (Grade 3 or more) resulting from lapatinib are rare (1-3%).  
For CTCAE, v. 4 Grade 4 rash manifested as toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (i.e. Stevens-
Johnson’s Syndrome etc) lapatinib must be permanently discontinued. See Section 7. 7.4 for 
management guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal  
Experience thus far suggests that when lapatinib is used as monotherapy most diarrhea 
presents as uncomplicated CTCAE v. 4 grade 1 or 2 (G1 54%, G2 20%, G3 15%, G4<1%). 
In rare cases, diarrhea can be debilitating, and potentially life threatening if accompanied by 
[CONTACT_114475], renal insufficiency, and/or electrolyte imbalances. Standardized and universal 
guidelines have been developed by [CONTACT_408916] (ASCO) panel 
for treating chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (Benson, 2004). Early identification and 
intervention is critical for the optimal management of diarrhea.  A patient’s baseline bowel 
patterns should be established so that changes in patterns can be identified while the patient 
is on treatment.  See Section 7. 7.5 for management of nausea and/or vomiting and 
Appendix V for diarrhea management guidelines.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Interstitial Lung Disease 
 See Section 7. 7.6 for management guidelines. 
7.4.7 Supply: Lapatinib and matching placebo will be provided free of charge by [CONTACT_744022] a vendor, Biologics, Inc., under contract to RTOG.

Inc. for destruction (see contact [CONTACT_85830]) . It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
ensure that a current record of agent disposition is maintained at each study site where agents 
are inventoried and disposed, including dates and quantities. Sites should complete the drug 
destruction form located on the RTOG web site, www.rtog.org  , under protocol-specific 
materials/regulatory resources and send the form to Biologics (see above for contact 
[CONTACT_3031]). 
 
7.6 Dose Modifications (3/22/16) 
7.6.1  Cisplatin Modifications, Day 29 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia:  If on the day of scheduled treatment with cisplatin the absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) is < 1200, hold treatment until ANC ≥ 1200, then treat at 100% dose. 
Neutropenic fever will require permanent 25% dose reduction. Per CTCAE, v. 4, febrile 
neutropenia is described as ANC < 1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 degrees C 
(101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more 
than 1 hour. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thrombocytopenia:  If on the day of scheduled treatment with cisplatin the platelet count is < 
75,000, hold treatment until platelets are > 75,000, then treat at 100% dose. 
Thrombocytopenia that results in bleeding will require a 25% dose reduction. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurotoxicity:  If any signs of grade 3 or greater neurotoxicity occur, discontinue cisplatin. 
Continue radiation therapy ( RT) and lapatinib/placebo. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Adverse Events:  Cisplatin should be administered on the scheduled day of treatment 
using the following guidelines. Note : If creatinine is > 1.3 mg/dl, clearance must be 
calculated (Cockcroft-Gault) in order to make dose adjustment. If the calculated nomogram 
is 50 mL/min or above, a 24-hour urine collection is not needed, but if the calculation is less 
than 50 mL/min, a 24-hour urine collection is mandated and the cisplatin will be determined 
as follows: 
 
Serum Creatinine  Creatinine Clearance  Cisplatin Dose  
≤ 1.5 mg/dl        OR > 50 ml/min.  100 mg/m2 
> 1.5  mg/dl        AND  40-50 ml/min.  50 mg/m2 
> 1.5 mg/dl       OR  < 40 ml/min.  Hold drug*  
  
*Cisplatin should be held (but RT continued), and the creatinine measured weekly. If the 
serum creatinine is < 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance is > 50 ml/min, then the second dose 
of cisplatin can be given at the reduced dose of 50 mg/m2. Also see Section [IP_ADDRESS] below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Adverse Events 
 Mucositis : Significant mucositis from radiation and cisplatin is expected and will not be 
an indication for cisplatin dose modification. No cisplatin dose reductions will be made. 
     34   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
  Ototoxicity: For new clinical hearing loss not requiring a hearing aid or for tinnitus that 
interferes with activities of daily living, treat at 50% dose reduction. For hearing loss 
requiring a hearing aid, discontinue cisplatin. Continue RT and lapatinib/placebo.  
 If the physician is unsure about the severity of the hearing loss, an audiogram is 
encouraged. 
[IP_ADDRESS] If the second dose of cisplatin is delayed more than 21 days because of hematologic or 
renal adverse events, that dose will be omitted. 
7.6.2 Lapatinib/Placebo Modifications 
 Patients will be treated per protocol as described in Section 7.2.2 or until disease progression 
or withdrawal from treatment due to unacceptable adverse event or treatment consent 
withdrawal. 
 
If lapatinib dose reduction is required the following general rules should be applied: 
 Lapatinib/placebo dose should be reduced by [CONTACT_122271] [ADDRESS_1017574] been exhausted without an improvement of 
patient status. 
 Lapatinib/placebo should not be used at doses below 1000 mg if given as monotherapy 
or below 750 mg concomitantly with cisplatin. 
 
See the table below for a summary of dose holding/interruptions and dose de-escalation 
recommendations in case of lapatinib-related adverse events (graded according to CTCAE, v. 
4). See Section 7.7 below for management guidelines of lapatinib adverse events. 
 
Adverse Event  (CTCAE, v. 4)  Action 
Non-hematological, grade 1 or 2

injury caused by [CONTACT_430930].  
 
Such signs and symptoms may inc lude abdominal pain, 
fever, jaundice, rash, eosinophilia or a PS drop of ≥  1 
point from baseline. Refer to Section 7.7.4.  
In case of multiple short interruptions of dose due to either adverse events or drug supply or other reasons the 
sum of days without lapatinib  treatment should not exceed 21 days in any 90 day treatment period.  
 
 
7.7 Management of Lapatinib/Placebo Adverse Events ( 8/5/14 ) 
 NOTE: SEE APPENDIX V FOR MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHEA. 
7.7.1 Management of Non-Hematologic Adverse Events 
If any of the following conditions occur, administration of lapatinib/placebo may be interrupted 
for a maximum of 14 days to allow the adverse event ( AE) to resolve or decrease in severity: 
 CTCAE, v. [ADDRESS_1017578] of grade 
2 rash; 
 No consideration and/or corroborative evidence that the AE is due to progressive 
disease;  
 The AE is consistent with previously described lapatinib/placebo AEs. At a minimum, 
reassessment of AEs should be done weekly and more frequently if clinically indicated. 
When the AE decreases in severity to CTCAE, v. [ADDRESS_1017579] a ≥ 20% 
decrease in LVEF relative to baseline, or the ejection fraction is below the institution's lower 
limit of normal, then lapatinib/placebo should be permanently discontinued, and the patient 
should have a repeat evaluation of ejection fraction [ADDRESS_1017580] 
results indicating abnormal LVEF (see Section 7.7.2 ). 
7.7.[ADDRESS_1017581] continue to be followed per the Liver Chemistry 
Follow-up Criteria below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Permanent Discontinuation Criteria 
If a patient experiences ALT > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2.0 × ULN (> 35% direct; bilirubin 
fractionation required), then the following actions must be taken: 
 Immediately and permanently discontinue investigational product;  
 In addition to the liver event follow up assessments, the following are suggested:  
specialist or hepatology consultation; anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle 
antibody, and Type 1 anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies; and liver imaging 
and/or liver biopsy to evaluate liver disease; 
 Promptly report the event to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning its occurrence; 
     36   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
  Monitor every 7 calendar days until liver chemistries resolve, stabilize or return to 
within baseline values; 
 Do not re-challenge with investigational product. 
NOTE :  If bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable and a patient meets the criterion of 
total bilirubin >2.0 × ULN, then the management of hepatotoxicity actions above must still be 
performed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interruption Criteria 
If a patient experiences: 
 ALT >8 × ULN or 
 ALT >5 × ULN persisting for > 14 calendar days: retest within [ADDRESS_1017582] 
occurrence and then every 7 calendar days to determine if ALT elevation persists 
or 
 ALT >3 × ULN with signs or symptoms of hepatitis or hypersensitivity (the 
appearance or worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia) 
then hold investigational product for [ADDRESS_1017583]. Wong, to discuss the 
possibility of re-starting lapatinib. Liver chemistries and aforementioned signs and symptoms 
should be monitored at a minimum of every 14 calendar days until resolution, stabilization, 
or a return to baseline values, at which point monitoring should be continued per protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Continuation Criteria 
If a patient experiences ALT >3 × ULN but <5 × ULN and total bilirubin ≤2 × ULN, without 
signs or symptoms of hepatitis or hypersensitivity, and who can be monitored every 7 
calendar days , then the following actions should be taken: 
 C
ontinue investigational product; 
 Monitor every 7 calendar days until liver chemistries resolve, stabilize, or return to 
within baseline, then monitor liver chemistries as per protocol assessment 
schedule; 
 If ALT >3 and < 5 × ULN persists for > 28 calendar days, discontinue  treatment 
[IP_ADDRESS] Liver Chemistry Follow-up Criteria 
For all patients who meet any of the liver chemistry criteria described above, make every 
attempt to carry out the liver event follow up assessments described below: 
 
Viral hepatitis serology including: 
 Hepatitis A IgM antibody; 
 Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM); 
 Hepatitis C RNA; 
 Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody; 
 Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain heterophile 
antibody or monospot testing); 
 Hepatitis E IgM antibody (if patient resides or has traveled outside [LOCATION_003] or Canada 
in past 3 months). 
  
Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 
 Complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia; 
 Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or 
hypersensitivity, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
jaundice, fever, or rash as relevant on an AE report form; 
 Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other 
over-the-counter medications, other putative hepatotoxins, and/or alcohol use. 
7.7.5 Management of Dermatologic Adverse Events 
Patients with poorly tolerated skin adverse events may be successfully managed by [CONTACT_1541] a 
brief (up to 14 days) therapy interruption; the daily dose of lapatinib should then be reinstated. 
However, the rash may improve without the need for interrupting therapy with lapatinib. Of note 
in current studies, many patients were able to resume lapatinib therapy at the same dose after 
resolution of rash, and they then had less extensive and/or severe rashes. A variety of agents 
can be used to manage skin rashes. These include mild- to-moderate strength steroid creams, 
     37   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017584], known, or established treatment proven effective for drug-related skin 
rashes or changes due to lapatinib. If the rash is severe (1-3%) then most commonly, a 
papular/pustular rash has been observed, which frequently improves even though the same 
dose of lapatinib therapy is continued uninterrupted. The need for oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_471063] a 
clinical decision of the investigator and should be preceded by a culture of affected areas and, 
if indicated, a dermatology consultation. Oral retinoids should not be given because of 
theoretical concerns about negatively affecting the lapatinib mechanism of action. Oral steroids 
are also strongly discouraged. Other options for treatment of significant rashes may be 
determined upon consultation with dermatologist. 
7.7.6 Management of Nausea and/or Vomiting 
 In patients who have emesis and are unable to retain lapatinib, every attempt should be made 
to obtain control of nausea and vomiting. A dose may be repeated if tablets can be visually 
found after the vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
7.7.7 Management of Interstitial Lung Disease 
If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of interstitial pneumonitis, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS), or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, lapatinib therapy should be 
interrupted and a thorough evaluation performed. If CTCAE v. 4 grade 3 or 4 
pneumonitis/fibrosis or pulmonary infiltrate is confirmed (and the relationship to lapatinib  
cannot be excluded), lapatinib must be permanently discontinued. All incidences of interstitial 
lung disease/ interstitial pneumonitis regardless of grade must be reported as serious adverse 
events (SAEs). 
7.7.8 Management of Other Adverse Events 
For any other CTCAE v. 4 grade 3 or 4 adverse events or any clinically significant, lower-grade 
adverse event, treatment with lapatinib should be interrupted for a maximum of 14 days until 
the patient recovers completely or the adverse event reverts to CTCAE v. 4 grade 1 or to 
baseline grade. If recurrence of an adverse event after drug holiday/interruptions is observed , 
then a dose reduction by [ADDRESS_1017585] been exhausted without an improvement of patient 
status. 
 
7.8 Modality Review 
The Principal Investigator, Stuart Wong, MD, will perform a Chemotherapy Assurance Review of 
all patients who receive or are to receive chemotherapy in this trial.  The goal of the review is to 
evaluate protocol compliance. The review process is contingent on timely submission of 
chemotherapy treatment data as specified in Section 12.1. The scoring mechanism is: Per 
Protocol , Acceptable Variation, Unacceptable Deviation, and Not Evaluable .  A report is sent 
to each institution once per year to notify the institution about compliance for each case reviewed 
in that year. 
   
 T
he Principal Investigator, Stuart Wong, MD, will perform a Quality Assurance Review after 
complete data for the first [ADDRESS_1017586]. 
  
7.9 Adverse Events ( 3/22/17) 
 All AE reporting on the study case report forms (CRFs) should follow grading criteria 
instructions on the specific CRF.  
7.9.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 Definition of an AE : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorabl e 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, 
possible, probable, or definite). (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH], E2A, E6).  
     38   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
  
AEs, as defined above, experienced by [CONTACT_744033] (see Section 12.1).  
 
NOTE: If the event is a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [see next section], further reporting 
will be required. Reporting AEs only fulfills Data Management reporting requirements.  
7.9.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)   
 Definition of an SAE : An undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: 
 is fatal or life-threatening ; 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; 
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ; 
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_743968]:  
      routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition; 
      elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug; 
      treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]; 
      social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s 
general condition. 
 is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
 Any pregnancy, including a male patient’s impregnation of his partner, occurring on study must 
be reported as a medically significant event. 
 
SAE reporting is safety related and separate and in addition to the Data Management reporting 
requirements as outlined in the previous AE reporting section.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Additions to SAE Definition 
 Cardiac dysfunction will be reported as an SAE and will be defined as any signs or 
symptoms of deterioration in left ventricular cardiac function that are grade 3 
(CTCAE, v. 4) or a ≥ 20% decrease in left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction (LVEF)  
relative to baseline which is below the institution's lower limit of normal. 
 Hepatobiliary events have been seen in subjects taking lapatinib and other tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors.  As a precaution, the following will be reported as an SAE:• ALT > 
3×ULN and total bilirubin > 2.0×ULN (>35% direct; bilirubin fractionation required). 
Note :  If bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable and a subject meets the criterion 
of total bilirubin > 2.0 × ULN, then the event should still be reported as an SAE. Other 
hepatic events should be documented as an AE or an SAE as appropriate. 
 
 
7.10 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Requirements (9/27/16) 
The treating investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to RTOG and per 
the local IRB per institutional policy. This study will utilize the RTOG SAE Report Form for 
reporting of SAEs. The SAE Report Form, SAE Reporting Guidelines, and SAE Report Form 
Instructions are available on the RTOG web site, www.RTOG.org. 
 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after protocol -
specified procedures begin and [ADDRESS_1017587] be 
reported to RTOG within the timeframe detailed in the reporting table below.   Information about all 
SAEs is collected and recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections 
of the form  must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator 
must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is 
more than one study treatment ), complete the SAE Report Form , and e-mail the completed   
form to RTOG at [EMAIL_14196] . RTOG will report applicable SAEs to [COMPANY_001] within 
24 hours of awareness.   
     39   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017588] be 
reported within 5 working days. 
 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 days period should only be reported to RTOG if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to protocol treatment; see the reporting table below 
for timeframes. Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be 
reported as follow up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] .  
 
The SAE report should comprise a full written summary, detailing relevant aspects of the SAE 
in question. The SAE summary also must include the investigator’s assessment of 
expectedness and relatedness to specific protocol treatment (e.g., radiation , cisplatin, or 
lapatinib) . When applicable, information from relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_265152]. Initial and follow-up information, when it becomes available, should 
be e-mailed to [EMAIL_14196] . In the rare event when Internet connectivity is 
disrupted, a 24-h our notification must be made to the RTOG Operations Office by [CONTACT_648], (1-
4189215- 574-3191).  An electronic report must be submitted immediately upon re-establish of 
the Internet connection. RTOG will report the SAE to the FDA and to [COMPANY_001]. 
 
SAEs brought to the attention of the investigator at any time after cessation of protocol 
treatment and considered by [CONTACT_744034], using the SAE Form instructions.  
 
All SAEs must be e-mailed to [EMAIL_14196]  within the designated timeframe 
outlined in the table below as well as the SAE Form Instructions.  RTOG will complete a 
preliminary review of the SAE details and may contact [CONTACT_744035].  RTOG then 
will report the SAE to the FDA and [COMPANY_001] . Note: The individual completing the SAE 
Report Form should remain vigilant for RTOG’s review and be prepared to respond to 
queries expeditiously in order to ensure timely reporting to the F DA and [COMPANY_001]. 
 
Late Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies: Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse 
Events that Occur on Studies under an IND within [ADDRESS_1017589] Administration of 
the Investigational Agent/Intervention1 
 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immed iately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may req uire medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported within the timeframes 
detailed in the table below.

Expedited 10 cale ndar day reports for:  
 Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
 Grade 3 adverse events  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  (2/2/16) 
Patients who become pregnant during the study should discontinue the study immediately.  
Investigators should report any pregnancy, including a male patient’s impregnation of his 
partner, as a grade 3 SAE and submit an SAE report to RTOG at [EMAIL_14196] . 
Investigators should submit the pregnancy report form within 14 days of notification. RTOG 
will report the pregnancy to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of awareness. Patients should be 
instructed to notify the investigator if it is determined after completion of the study that they 
become pregnant either during the treatment phase of the study or within five calendar days 
after the treatment period. Whenever possible a pregnancy should be followed to term, any 
premature termination reported, and the status of the mother and child should be reported 
after delivery to RTOG Headquarters. RTOG will report the status to [COMPANY_001]. 
7.10.2 Assessment of Causality and Expectedness 
Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_744036], if any, to study drug treatment.  Causality should be assessed 
using the following categories: no (not related), or yes (reasonable possibility). 
 
The determination of expectedness and the degree of certainty with which a SAE is attributed 
to drug treatment (or alternative causes, e.g. natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, etc.) will be determined by [CONTACT_744037]: 
 Known pharmacology of the drug 
 Reaction of similar nature being previously observed with this drug or class of drug 
 The event having often been reported in literature for similar drugs as drug related (e.g. 
skin rashes, blood dyscrasia) 
 The event being related by [CONTACT_744038] 
(dechallenge) or reproduced on rechallenge. 
 
The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_743970]/or causality in light of follow-
up information, by [CONTACT_744039]. The expectedness and causality 
assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements to 
the FDA. 
 
8.0 SURGERY 
8.1 Neck Dissection  (8/13/15) 
All patients will be assessed [ADDRESS_1017591] scan or MRI or PET/CT.  
 
A neck dissection is required for patients with persistent nodal disease, any stage, if a palpable 
abnormality or worrisome radiographic abnormality persists in the neck 8-9 weeks after 
     41   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 completion of therapy. A neck dissection is optional for patients with multiple positive lymph 
nodes or with lymph nodes exceeding 3 cm in diameter at pre-treatment (N2a, N2b, N3) who 
achieve a complete clinical and radiographic response in the neck. Surgery will be performed 
within 2 weeks once the decision for neck dissection is made. The status of the primary tumor 
should be assessed thoroughly at the beginning of the surgical procedure before undertaking 
nodal dissection. Presence of persistent disease at the primary site, confirmed by [CONTACT_585766], 
will be considered a failure of protocol treatment. Further treatment of such a patient will depend 
on the clinical situation and are at the discretion of the treating physicians. 
8.1.1  For Patients Undergoing a Neck Dissection 
Cervical lymphadenectomy will encompass the original levels of lymph node involvement, 
which should be removed en bloc. Preservation of the accessory nerve, jugular vein, and 
sternomastoid muscle is encouraged if consistent with complete removal of all residual nodal 
disease; however, the extent of the neck dissection will be at the discretion of the surgeon. A 
selective neck dissection should be performed when feasible. At no time will synchronous 
bilateral radical neck dissections be performed. If bilateral radical neck dissections are 
necessary the neck procedure must be staged at an interval of [ADDRESS_1017592] be divided and oriented into discrete anatomic levels in 
the operating room by [CONTACT_744040], and submitted for pathologic review in separate 
containers. Discrete groups of nodes that are matted or spaced too closely to be resolved as 
separate nodes under the microscope or by [CONTACT_6789]-PET/CT (< 0.5 cm intervening distance) will 
be categorized as “nodal clusters.” These clusters will be considered equivalent to solitary 
nodes to allow for simpler and more accurate categorization of all sampled tissue. An attending 
pathologist should oversee evaluation of all neck dissection specimens according to Appendix 
IV. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1017593] submit a Surgery Form (S1), a Surgical Operative Report (S2), and a Surgical 
Pathology Report (S5) for patients who have surgery to the primary site and/or to regional 
nodes post-treatment (see Section 12.1). 
 
8.2 Surgical Removal (Salvage) of the Primary Tumor 
Directed biopsies at the site of the index lesions will not be performed in the absence of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_743971]. Criteria for biopsy after chemoradiation include a persistent mucosal abnormality or 
imaging studies that are suspi[INVESTIGATOR_743972] 8-9 weeks after 
completion of therapy. Options for salvage therapy will depend upon the clinical situation and are 
at the discretion of the treating physicians. Surgical removal (salvage resection) of the primary 
tumor will be performed, if possible, when biopsy-proven cancer remains more than three months 
after completion of therapy. The nature of the surgical resection will be dictated by [CONTACT_744041]. The operation will be conducted using accepted criteria for primary 
surgical treatment of the cancer. 
 
Tissues for pathologic evaluation of margins must be taken from the patient (rather than the 
surgical specimen itself). However, the specimen itself should be marked at sites corresponding 
to the evaluated margins in order to assess sampling error in obtaining clear margins. If gross 
tumor remains or when no effort to remove tumor has been made, the patient will be considered 
to have "gross residual disease." In the absence of residual disease, if the cancer extends to 
within [ADDRESS_1017594] "close" margins. 
 
 
9.0 OTHER THERAPY 
9.1 Permitted Supportive Therapy 
 All supportive therapy for optimal medical care will be given during the study period at the 
discretion of the attending physician(s) within the parameters of the protocol and documented on 
each site’s source documents as concomitant medication.  
 
9.2 Non-permitted Supportive Therapy 
9.2.1   Hematopoietic Growth Factors 
The routine use of erythropoietic growth factors (e.g. darbepoetin, erythropoietin) is strongly 
discouraged. Granulocytic growth factors (e.g. filgrastim) should not be used concurrently 
     42   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 during radiation therapy, unless radiation therapy has been stopped to allow for recovery of 
neutropenia and fever. Radiation therapy, lapatinib/placebo, and/or cisplatin should not be 
resumed within [ADDRESS_1017595] dose of filgrastim. 
 
10.0 TISSUE/SPECIMEN SUBMISSION (8/13/15) 
NOTE : Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in the correlative 
components of the study, such as tissue/specimen submission.  If the patient consents to 
participate in the tissue/specimen component of the study, the site is required to submit the 
patient’s specimens as specified in Section 10.0 of the protocol. Sites are not permitted to delete 
the tissue/specimen component from the protocol or from the sample consent. 
10.1 Tissue/Specimen Submission  
 The  Biospecimen Bank at the University of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco acquires and maintains high 
quality specimens from RTOG trials. Tissue from each block is preserved through careful block 
storage and processing. The RTOG encourages participants in protocol studies to consent to the 
banking of their tissue. The Biospecimen Bank at UCSF provides tissue specimens to 
investigators for translational research studies. Translational research studies integrate the 
newest research findings into current protocols to investigate important biologic questions. The  
Biospecimen Bank at UCSF also collects tissue for central pathology review. Central review of 
tissue can be for eligibility and/or analysis.  
 
 In this study, pre-treatment tissue will be submitted to the Biospecimen Bank at UCSF for the 
purpose of central review of pathology (mandatory for eligibility for oropharyngeal patients) , for 
banking, and for translational research (highly recommended but optional). In addition, blood will 
be submitted pre-treatment, at the end of radiation treatment, and at 6 months from the end of 
treatment for translational research (highly recommended but optional ).  
 
 If the patient consents to submission of tissue and blood for translational research, pre-treatment 
tissue will be used to test for predictive biomarkers of lapatinib response, lapatinib resistance, 
poor RFS, and metastasis. Blood will be used to test for prognostic biomarkers of poor RFS and 
predictive biomarkers of lapatinib sensitivity and resistance (see Section 1.6 for further details).  
  
10.2 Specimen Collection For Central Review For Eligibility: Mandatory for Oropharyngeal 
Patients (9/27/16) 
Patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma must consent to participate in use of submitted 
tissue for HPV analysis by p16 immunohistochemistry. 
 
 For patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma, the Biospecimen Bank at UCSF will process [ADDRESS_1017596]. Adel El-Naggar who will 
determine HPV status by p16 immunohistochemistry within 7-10 business days. Note : If a 
specimen was previously submitted to the Biospecimen Bank at UCSF for determination of HPV 
status for another RTOG trial and found to be p16 negative, investigators can forward a 
Specimen Transmittal (ST) Form to the Biospecimen Bank requesting that the specimen be sent 
to [CONTACT_492205]-Naggar for central lab confirmation of p16 negativity. 
 
The following material must be provided to the Biospecimen Bank at UCSF for Central Review: 
10.2.1  One H & E stained slide per positive biopsy site (slide can be duplicate cut stained H&E; it does 
not have to be the diagnostic slide);  
10.2.2  A corresponding paraffin-embedded tissue block of the tumor or three paraffin-embedded 2mm 
punches from the same block (with an H&E of the embedded punches); Institutions that are 
unable to submit a tissue block for the required HPV analysis of oropharyngeal cases may 
instead take 4 unstained sections from the block then obtain three 2 mm core punches of the 
block and re-embed the core punches into a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_743973] (or sites can 
send the punches to the Biospecimen Bank to be embedded). Institutions can request an FFPE 
specimen plug kit (see Appendix IV) from the  Biospecimen Bank at UCSF free of charge for 
this purpose: [PHONE_5825] (7864)/FAX 415- 476-5271; [EMAIL_14197] . 
 
If an institution is uncomfortable with obtaining the unstained sections and punches and wants 
to retain the tissue block, the site can send the entire block to the  Biospecimen Bank at UCSF , 
and the Bank will obtain the unstained sections and the core punches from the block and return 
     43   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/[ADDRESS_1017597] (to obtain the sections, perform the 
core punch procedure, and return the block) on the submission form.  Note : For oropharyngeal 
carcinoma patients, there is a 10-day turnaround needed for HPV assays, so institutions should 
send the block (or punches/slides) by [CONTACT_744042]. 
 
If an institution is not allowed to submit a tissue block or take punch biopsy cores from the 
paraffin block , the site may submit 15 unstained slides, but this is considered as an exception. 
10.2.3 A Pathology Report documenting that the submitted block, core, or slides contain tumor; the 
report must include the RTOG protocol number and patient’s case number. The patient’s name 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or other identifying information should be removed from the report. The surgical pathology 
numbers and information must NOT be removed from the report. 
 
The submitted material must be from malignant tumor, not necrotic or fibrotic tissue. If the 
submitted material is reviewed and is not tumor, the site may be assessed a protocol violation. 
The block, unstained, or punches must all be from the same block as the H&E being submitted. 
10.2. 4 A Specimen Transmittal (ST) Form stating that the tissue is being submitted for Central Review.  
The Form must include the RTOG protocol number and the patient’s case number. 
10.2. 5 Central Review will be performed for every oropharyngeal case by [CONTACT_744043]-Naggar, MD, PhD. 
 
10.3 Specimen Collection for Tissue Banking and Translational Research: Highly 
Recommended but Optional   (8/13/15) 
 For patients who have consented to participate in the tissue/blood component of the study 
 
The following must be provided in order for the case to be evaluable for the Biospecimen Bank 
(Note : For patients with oropharyngeal cancer, the H&E slides and block must be submitted for 
required central review as described above in Section 10.2 and would not be submitted again as 
described below.) :  
10.3.1  One H&E stained slide (slide can be a duplicate cut stained H&E; it does not have to be the 
diagnostic slide.) 
10.3.2  A corresponding paraffin-embedded tissue block (the block must match the H&E being 
submitted) of the tumor or three 2 mm diameter core of tumor tissue, punched from the tissue 
block containing the tumor with a punch tool and embedded in paraffin along with a 
corresponding H&E slide . The new block made from the punches must be labeled with the 
surgical pathology number. Note: A kit with the punch, tube, and instructions can be obtained 
free of charge from the Biospecimen Bank. Block or core must be clearly labeled with the 
pathology identification number and block ID that corresponds to the Pathology Report. If sites 
are unable to submit tissue blocks, then an exception can be made to accept [ADDRESS_1017598] all be from the same block as the H&E being 
submitted (in Section 10.3.1). 
10.3. [ADDRESS_1017599] include the RTOG protocol number and patient’s case number. The patient’s name [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
other identifying information should be removed from the report. The surgical pathology 
numbers and information must NOT be removed from the report. 
 
The submitted material must be from malignant tumor, not necrotic or fibrotic tissue. If the 
submitted material is reviewed and is not tumor, the site may be assessed a protocol violation. 
10.3. 4 Plasma and whole blood will be collected and stored for future translational studies. See 
Appendix IV for specimen processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_22026]. Blood collection kits can be 
requested from the Biospecimen Bank free of charge at [EMAIL_14198] or 415-476- 7864.

10.5 Confidentiality/Storage  
 (See the RTOG Patient Tissue Consent Frequently Asked Questions, 
http://www.rtog.org/Researchers/BiospecimenResource/BiospecimenResourceFAQs.aspx  for 
further details.) 
10.5.1  Upon receipt, the specimen is labeled with the RTOG protocol number and the patient’s case 
number only. The Biospecimen Bank at USCF database only includes the following information: 
the number of specimens received, the date the specimens were received, documentation of 
material sent to a qualified investigator, type of material sent, and the date the specimens were 
sent to the investigator. No clinical information is kept in the database.  
10.5.2  Specimens for tissue banking will be stored for an indefinite period of time. Specimens for 
central review will be retained until the study is terminated. Specimens for the translational 
research component of this protocol will be retained until the study is terminated, unless the 
patient has consented to storage for future studies. If at any time the patient withdraws consent 
to store and use specimens, the material will be returned to the institution that submitted it. 
 
11.0 PATIENT ASSESSMENTS 
11.1 Study Parameters : See Appendix I for a summary of assessments. See Section 11.2 below for 
details of assessments and exceptions. 
 
11.2 Details of Assessments (8/13/15) 
11.2.1 It is necessary to repeat the ECHO or MUGA at week 12 ([ADDRESS_1017603]-completion of radiation 
therapy); see Section 7.7.2. 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1017604] scan, or a PET/CT scan must be done within [ADDRESS_1017605] scan or MRI or PET/CT 
scan of the tumor site and neck nodes must be done within 42 calendar days prior to 
registration. Note: The CT scan of the neck and/or PET/CT performed for radiation planning 
may serve as both staging and planning tools. 
11.2.3 If the patient consents to submission of tissue and blood for translational research, primary 
tumor tissue will be submitted pre-treatment, and peripheral blood will be submitted pre-
treatment, at the end of radiation therapy, and at 6 months from end of treatment. 
11.2. 4 Patients will be asked to document daily lapatinib/placebo on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_743974], which will be collected by [CONTACT_633736]. Institutions will submit the DP form to RTOG at the end of concurrent treatment 
and every month during maintenance treatment (see Section 12.1). 
11.2. 5 Evaluation During Radiotherapy 
 A brief history and physical by a Radiation Oncologist and/or Medical Oncologist must be 
done weekly. 
 Bilirubin and AST/ALT must be done 4 weeks after start of lapatinib/placebo. 
11.2. 6 Evaluation in Follow Up 
 Patients will be seen in long-term follow up every 3 months for years 1 and 2, every 6 
months for years 3-5 and then annually until publication of study results. 
 A brief history and physical by a Radiation Oncologist and/or Medical Oncologist and/or 
ENT or Head & Neck Surgeon must be done at 4 weeks and 3 months from the end of 
radiation treatment, then every 3 months through year 2, every 6 months for years 3-5, then 
annually. A laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror and/or fiberoptic and/or direct procedure) is 
recommended at these time points but is not required. 
 Post-radiation imaging evaluation of the primary tumor and neck at [ADDRESS_1017606], MRI, 
or PET/CT of the head and neck or “whole body” PET/CT (minimum neck and chest), 
     46   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 based on the preference of the treating clinician. However, if a pre-treatment PET/CT was 
performed, it is highly recommended that a post-radiation PET/CT be used as the post-
radiation imaging modality. 
 
 Post-radiation imaging evaluation (CT scan or MRI) of the primary tumor and neck also 
must be done a t 6 and 12 months from end of treatment, then annually until year 5.  
  A c
hest CT scan must be done at 6 and 12 months from end of treatment, then annually 
until year 5. 
 
11.3 Measurement of Response/Progression  
11.3.1 Response versus “Tumor Clearance” versus Cancer Progression  
Response and confirmation of local (primary site) or regional (neck) “tumor clearance” are not 
endpoints in this study. Clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive local-regional disease 
beyond [ADDRESS_1017607] or MRI (of head and neck region, with  
Chest CT), or PET/CT (including chest anatomy) may be used as radiographic evaluation of 
overall cancer status. The primary, neck and chest portions of the scans should be evaluated 
and reported separately. The CT portion of a PET/CT may serve as sufficient radiographic 
evaluation of the chest. If CT or MRI is used for evaluation of the head and neck region, CT of 
chest will be needed to rule out distant disease or second primaries at the designated 
evaluation intervals as outlined above in Section 11.2.6 and Appendix I. 
11.3.2 Local or Regional Progression 
Local (primary site) or regional (neck) progression is defined as palpable residual disease or 
CT/MRI evidence of persistent disease at the primary site or neck. The location of progressive 
disease should be separately distinguished (local vs. neck) to document the precise pattern of 
failure if possible. Progression of local or regional disease should be confirmed by [CONTACT_744044]. 
11.3.3 Distant Metastasis 
Clear evidence of distant metastases (lung, bone, brain, etc.); biopsy is recommended where 
possible. A solitary, spi[INVESTIGATOR_743975]/nodule is considered a second primary neoplasm 
unless proven otherwise.  
11.3.4 Second Primary Neoplasm 
Tumor reappearing with the initial and immediate adjoining anatomical region of the primary will 
be considered local recurrence. Multiple lung nodules/masses are considered distant 
metastases from the index cancer unless proven otherwise.  
 
11.4 Criteria for Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment 
 Progression of disease; 
 Unacceptable adverse events per the judgment of the treating physician(s); 
 Patient refusal. 
 
 If protocol treatment is discontinued, follow up and data collection will continue as specified in the 
protocol. 
 
11.5 Quality of Life/Patient-Reported Outcomes Instruments 
Note : Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in the correlative components of the 
study, such as quality of life assessment. If the patient consents to participate in the quality of life 
(QOL) component of the study, sites are required to administer the baseline QOL and PRO 
assessments prior to the start of protocol treatment: the PSS-HN, FACT-HN, and XeQOLS. 
Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (pretreatment) and at 3, 12, and 24 months from 
completion of radiation treatment. 
11.5.1 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head & Neck (FACT-H&N)  is a 
multidimensional, patient-self report quality of life ( QOL ) instrument specifically designed and 
validated for use with head and neck patients. The patient can complete the 12-item head and 
neck subscale in 5-10 minutes. The site research nurse or CRA is encouraged to be sensitive 
to each patient's demeanor. If patients appear particularly uncomfortable answering a question, 
they will be informed that they can skip that question.  Similarly, interviewers will give patients a 
short break if the patient appears fatigued or otherwise in need of a few minutes break. 
     47   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 11.5.2 The University of Michigan Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale (XeQOLS)  consists of 15 
items covering 4 major domains of oral health-related quality of life: physical functioning, 
personal/psychological functioning, social functioning, and pain/discomfort issues. The patient 
can respond to the 15 items in the scale in approximately 5 minutes. The Scale is only available 
in English.  
11.5.3 The Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer (PSS- HN) consists of assessment of 
3 functional areas (subscales): Normalcy of Diet, Eating in Public, and Understandability of 
Speech. The site research nurse or clinical research associate (CRA) will administer the PSS-
HN. Interviewers are encouraged to be sensitive to each patient's demeanor. If patients appear 
particularly uncomfortable answering a question, they will be informed that they can skip that 
question.  Similarly, interviewers will give patients a short break if the patient appears fatigued 
or otherwise in need of a few minutes break. The interviewer rates the patient on each scale 
based on the patient’s responses to targeted questions. The PSS-HN takes approximately [ADDRESS_1017608] ete.

12.2.1  Digital Data Submission to RTOG Headquarters  
Digital data will be submitted to RTOG via the site’s TRIAD account.  
12.2.2 Method of Plan Submission 
RTOG will provide sites with the American College of Radiology Imaging Network’s image 
acquisition and management software, TRIAD, via electronic installation.   TRIAD offers a web-
based, software solution allowing institutions to submit DICOM data secure ly through electronic 
transmission. Internal to the site, TRIAD allows the site to “DICOM push” from the site’s 
Treatment Planning System (TPS), thus eliminating the need to burn physical media. Once the 
institution has transferred the RT data onto a TRIAD workstation, the software will anonymize, 
encrypt, and submit the DICOM RT data via secure internet to the RTOG image archive. For 
more information please visit the TRIAD web site at https://triad.acr.org .  
 
Institutions initiate installation of TRIAD by e-mailing the name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] e-mail address of the 
person(s) responsible at the site for submitting RT data for the trial (recommend the Physicist 
and/or Dosimetrist) to [EMAIL_6133]. The site will then receive a TRIAD greeting 
letter, which describes how to prepare for the installation.   
 
TRIAD technical assistance may be requested by e-mailing [EMAIL_6133] .  
Please always include the institution name [CONTACT_671089].

13.3 Randomization and Stratification (10/3/13) 
Patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Additionally, patients will be stratified 
according to age ( ≤ 65 vs. > 65); T stage ( T1-3 vs. T4); and N stage (N0-2a vs. N2b-3).  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1017610] event will be counted for progression-free survival, local-
regional failure, and distant metastasis. Anything not explicitly in the table (e.g., second primary 
tumor) is not considered an event, and the patient will continue to be followed for failure. For 
overall survival, death from any cause will be considered a failure. All failure times will be 
measured from randomization to the date of failure, competing risk, or last follow- up.

13.5  Sample Size and Patient Accrual (9/27/16) 
This study will be a randomized phase II screening trial as proposed by [CONTACT_629556], et al (2005). 
Based on the accrual to RTOG [ADDRESS_1017611]-activation (allowing for IRB approvals). In RTOG 0129, 
this group of patients treated on the accelerated fractionation arm had a 2-year progression-free 
survival (PFS) rate of 53.5%. Hazard rates for first and second years are 37% and 15%. Based 
on discussions with the study chair, a 35% reduction in the hazard rate is clinically meaningful. 
With statistical power 0.80 and significance level 0.20 (1-sided) and one interim efficacy and 
futility analysis, the Lan-Demets (OF) spending function boundary for efficacy and rho family 
spending function with parameter of 1.5 for futility were utilized to derive a nonbinding rule. A total 
of 69 PFS events are required. To observe the required number of events, a sample size of 158 
accrued over 1.22 years with an additional 2.6 years of follow-up (total study duration 4.3 years 
including 6 months for IRB approvals) is required. Allowing for up to 10% of patients to be 
ineligible or not evaluable, the total original required sample size is [ADDRESS_1017612] 
patient is accrued will be used as the baseline for monitoring accrual. If the total accrual during 
months 18 through 24 is less than 20% of the projected total for 6 months of accrual (15 patients), 
then the study statistician will recommend to the RTOG DMC and the sponsor that the protocol 
will be discontinued. If the total accrual is between 21-49%, then the protocol will continue to 
accrue subjects pending approval to remain open by [CONTACT_744046]. 
 
Revised Sample Size and Patient Accrual 
     50   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 As of September 2016, the observed accrual rate in this study is about 30 patients/year 
(2.5/month). To finish accrual within a reasonable timeframe and to maintain the same design 
parameters detailed above, we plan to accrue a total of 142 patients (128 analyzable), with a total 
accrual duration of 4.7 years instead of 5.9 years. According to this plan, we will finish accrual 
around March 2017. 
 
13.6 Analysis Plan (9/27/16) 
Progression-free and overall survival rates will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method 
(1958) and rates of distant metastasis (DM) and local-regional control (LRC) by [CONTACT_744047] (Kalbfleisch 1980) to account for competing risks (see Section 13.4). The 
distributions of the progression-free and overall survival times will be compared between 
treatment arms with a one sided log rank test (Mantel, 1966). Distant metastasis and local-
regional control will be compared using cause-specific log rank test. If the resulting p-value for 
PFS is < 0.1803, the result will be interpreted as a significant indication of lapatinib  improving 
progression-free survival of these patients to warrant a definitive phase III trial .  
 
Only adverse events (AEs) assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related (if the 
relationship is missing, it will be assumed to be definitely, probably, or possibly) to protocol 
treatment will be considered. The rates of adverse events and  treatment compliance will be 
estimated using a binomial distribution along with their associated 95% confidence intervals and 
will be compared using Fisher’s exact test. 
 
Comparison of change from baseline quality of life scores between the [ADDRESS_1017613] 87% power to detect an effect size 
of 0.5 with a two-sided type I error rate of 5% and the statistical power will be 79% and 66% to 
detect effect sizes of 0.5 with 126 and 94 patients. Analysis of the covariance model (ANCOVA) 
will be used to adjust for effects from other factors. 
 
For analysis of local-regional control, distant metastasis, PFS, and OS, we will examine whether 
patients with normal baseline levels of biomarkers have a different prognosis than patients with 
abnormal baseline levels by [CONTACT_744048]-limit estimates of the survival function and 
comparing those estimates using the log-rank statistic. The relationship between local-regional 
control, distant metastasis, PFS, OS, and abnormal baseline marker levels also will be explored 
by [CONTACT_744049], both adjusted for baseline disease and 
patient characteristics and unadjusted. Assuming usable baseline tissue/blood samples can be 
obtained from 118 eligible patients (~75%), this will provide at least modest power (>69%) to 
detect large differences (hazard ratios > 2.0) between patients with normal and abnormal marker 
levels, assuming 50% abnormal prevalence, with a two-sided 5% alpha, for the PFS endpoint. 
13.6.[ADDRESS_1017614] to the protocol prescription, and the frequency and severity of AEs. The RTOG Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review this study twice a year in conjunction with the RTOG 
semiannual meetings with respect to patient accrual and morbidity. The DMC also will review 
this study on an “as needed” basis between meetings. 
13.6.2 Significance Testing for Early Termination and Reporting 
One interim treatment comparison will be performed when 50% (34 PFS failures) of the 69 
required number of PFS failures are observed. Only the primary endpoint will be tested in the 
interim analysis. The efficacy will be tested using boundary of 0.0699 on the p value scale for 
the interim tests and 0.1803 for the final analysis to preserve an overall alpha level of 0.20 for 
the study. A single interim futility analysis will be conducted when one-half (34) of the requisite 
events for definitive analysis have been observed. If the p value is equal to or greater than 
0.5827 favoring the control (i.e. in the wrong direction with respect to demonstrating that the 
lapatinib arm is more favorable), then early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_453734]. The results will be 
reported to the RTOG DMC with the treatment blinded. The responsible statistician may 
recommend early reporting of the results and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_123405] (if applicable) of the trial if the 
treatment effect with respect to PFS is highly significant or if it is not likely to be. 
     51   RTOG 3501 version date: 9/27/16 
 13.6.3 Analysis for Reporting the Initial Treatment Results 
The analysis to report the initial results of treatment will be undertaken when each patient has 
finished concurrent therapy, around July 2017. All randomized patients (ITT) will be included in 
the analysis. Eligible patients with both on-study and follow-up information will be considered 
for sensitivity analysis. The emphasis of this analysis will be on treatment compliance and 
adverse events. The usual components of this analysis are: 
 Tabulation of all cases entered, and any excluded from analysis with reasons for 
exclusion; 
 Patient accrual rate; 
 Institutional accrual; 
 Distribution of important baseline prognostic variables; 
 Frequency and severity of adverse events; 
 Compliance rate for treatment delivery with respect to the protocol prescription; 
 Observed results with respect to the endpoints described above. 
 
Only adverse events (AEs) assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related (if the 
relationship is missing, it will be assumed to be definitely, probably, or possibly) to protocol 
treatment will be considered. The rates of adverse events, treatment compliance, will be 
estimated using a binomial distribution along with their associated 95% confidence intervals 
and will be compared using Fisher’s exact test. 
13.6.4 Analysis for Reporting the Final Treatment Results 
The analysis to report the definitive results of treatment will be undertaken when 69 events 
(total from both arms) have been reported for the primary endpoint, PFS, unless the criteria for 
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_743976]. The time from when accrual is finish ed to this analysis is projected to be 
approximately 2.7 years based on  the observed accrual rate. All randomized patients (ITT) will 
be included in this analysis. Eligible patients with both on- study and follow-up information will 
be considered for sensitivity analysis. The usual components of this analysis are: 
 Tabulation of all cases entered, and any excluded from analysis with reasons for 
exclusion; 
 Patient accrual rate; 
 Institutional accrual; 
 Distribution of important baseline prognostic variables; 
 Frequency and severity of adverse events; 
 Observed results with respect to the endpoints described above. 
 
The difference in PFS between the control arm and the experimental arm will be tested using 
the one sided log-rank statistic at the significance level of 0.1803 given that the one interim 
analysis is carried out and shows no statistical significance. If the resulting p-value for efficacy 
is <0.1803, this result will be interpreted as an indication of lapatinib in improving progression-
free survival in these patients. 
 
A final analysis report will be prepared and provided for review by [CONTACT_22888]-investigators. Results 
for dissemination will be developed, and a manuscript drafted for review, approval, and 
submission. After manuscript acceptance, patient follow up will be discontinued and the trial 
terminated. It is anticipated that termination will occur approximately 3.9 years from when the 
accrual is finished. This time-frame may be extended depending on factors such as the 
observed accrual and event rates, in which case a new trial termination date will be 
established.

 APPENDI X V  
 
DIARRHEA MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES 
 
Presented in the sections below are the recommended guidelines for the management of diarrhea in patient s 
receiving lapatinib-based therapy; these guidelines were derived from the recommendations published by [CONTACT_744056] (Benson, 2004). 
 
Early identification and intervention is critical for the optimal management of diarrhea.  A patient’s baseline bowel 
patterns should be established so that changes in patterns can be identified while patient is on treatment.   
 
It is strongly recommended to give patients receiving lapatinib-based therapy a prescription of 
loperamide with instructions to start loperamide at the onset of diarrhea as per the recommendations 
outlined below.   
 
Patients should be instructed to first notify their physician/healthcare provider at onset of diarrhea of any 
severity . 
 
An assessment of frequency, consistency and duration as well as knowledge of other symptoms such as fever, 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and thirst should be taken at baseline. Consequently patients at high 
risk of diarrhea can be identified.  Patients should be educated on signs and symptoms of diarrhea with 
instructions to report any changes in bowel patterns to the physician.  
 
It is recommended that patient s keep a diary and record the number of diarrhea epi[INVESTIGATOR_301123] . 
They should also include information on any dietary changes or other observations that may be useful in the 
evaluation of their diarrhea history.  
 
If patients present with diarrhea of any Grade, check they are taking lapatinib correctly, i.e. single daily dose, 
rather than splitting it through the day. Obtain information on food (solid and liquid) and over the counter (OTC) 
medication, including herbal supplements, taken during the lapatinib treatment period. 
 
Definitions 
Define diarrhea compared to baseline (Table 1). 
 
Table 1 
Adverse Event 
Grade , CTCAE 
v. 4 Diarrhea

2 Increase of 4 -6 stools/day over baseline; moderate increase in ostomy output 
compared to baseline;  
3 Increase of ≥7 stools/day over baseline; incontinence; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374]; 
severe increase in ostomy output compared to baseline; limiting self care activities of 
daily living (ADL)

 APPENDIX V (Continued) 
Uncomplicated diarrhea  is considered mild- to-moderate and defined as CTCAE v. 4 grade 1 or 2 with no 
complicating signs or symptoms. 
Complicated diarrhea  is severe and defined as any CTCAE v. 4 grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or grade 1 or 2 with 
one or more of the following signs or symptoms: 
 Moderate to severe abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 Nausea/vomiting ≥Grade2 
 Decreased performance status 
 Fever 
 Sepsis 
 Neutropenia 
 Frank bleeding (red blood in stool) 
 Dehydration 
 
 
Management Guidelines for Patients Receiving Lapatinib Alone or as Combination Therapy 
A) Uncomplicated Diarrhea  
I. CTCAE Grade 1   
NOTE
:  Patient should be instructed to start supportive care immediately at the first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337] (i.e., unformed stool) and call their physician.  
 
1. Administer loperamide  
a. Initial dose 4mg followed by 2mg after every unformed stool. Re-evaluate after 24 hours, if: 
i. Diarrhea is resolving: 
 Continue loperamide treatment at 2mg dose after every unformed stool until diarrhea 
free (i.e., <Grade 1/bowel patterns returned to baseline) for 12 hours. 
 If diarrhea recurs, re-initiate loperamide treatment as needed to maintain normal

ii. Diarrhea is not resolving: 
 Administer loperamide at 2mg every 4 hours for the next 24 hour.  Re-evaluate after 
24 hours.  If diarrhea is resolving, administer loperamide at 2mg after every unformed 
stool until diarrhea free (i.e., <Grade 1/bowel patterns returned to baseline) for 12 
hours.  If diarrhea is not resolving continue loperamide treatment at 2mg every 4 
hours and re-evaluate every 24 hours.

MANAGEMENT OF DENTAL PROBLEMS IN IRRADIATED PATIENTS 
 
Dental Care for Irradiated Patients 
Goals for a dental care program include: 
1. To reduce incidence of bone necrosis. 
2. To reduce incidence of irradiation caries. 
3. To allow proper fitting of dentures following treatment. 
 
Pre-irradiation Care and Procedures 
The patients may be grouped into four groups in accordance with the problems they present prior to irradiation. 
 
Group [ADDRESS_1017652] 1/[ADDRESS_1017653] the teeth at risk.

 APPENDIX VII (Continued) 
Preventive Program 
The rationale behind the use of fluoride treatments is to make the tooth surfaces less susceptible to the decay 
process.  This is accomplished by a combination of increasing fluoride concentration on the tooth surface and by 
[CONTACT_629562].  Adequate results are obtained by:  
1) cleansing the teeth thoroughly, followed by a good home care dental prophylaxis program, 2) construction of  
fluoride carriers, custom-made mouth guards, which provide local application of fluoride solution to the gingiva 
and tooth surfaces.  Fluoride carriers are made individually with the use of casts.  Material used for making a 
mouth guard is "Sta-Guard" plastic used in conjunction with vacutrole unit produced by [CONTACT_629563], 
Corp., both of which are available through local dental supply.  This material is molded to the cast impression and 
allowed to harden.  A fluoride solution prepared at the M.D. Anderson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_743997], Inc., Dallas, [LOCATION_007] [ZIP_CODE].  It has been used to coat the plastic carrier for use in the mouth.  The 
patients are instructed to cleanse their teeth prior to placement of the carrier.  It is then worn in place for 5 
minutes each day.  The patients are instructed to rinse their mouths thoroughly following the use of the carrier.  
This will be continued for an indefinite period of time.  Close follow-up is necessary. 
 
Results 
In the 5-1/2 year program at the M.D. Anderson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629491] 1966, a study of 304 patients shows that 
the incidence of necrosis of the jaw was reduced to approximately 21% compared to 37% prior to initiation of the 
study.  Groups 3 and 4 patients randomized with and without fluoride treatment showed reduction in radiation 
carries from 67% to 34% among Group 3 patients, and from 65% to 22% among Group [ADDRESS_1017654] be remembered that extraction could lead to complications such as 
bone necrosis. 
 
Pulp exposure resulting from the decay process can usually be handled by [CONTACT_629564]/or root-canal 
therapy. 
 
Hypersensitivity of Teeth 
Occasionally, a patient will exhibit extreme sensitivity of the teeth secondary to diminished amounts of saliva.  
This has been shown to be reduced in incidence with the fluoride treatments.  Should this problem become 
manifest, increasing the fluoride treatment to [ADDRESS_1017655] increased susceptibility 
to bone necrosis for several reasons including:  impairment of normal metabolism, increased susceptibility to 
infection and severely limited repair process.  Bone necrosis occurs most often after dental or oral surgery in 
patients who have been previously radiated.  Conservative management should be tried first, though in more 
aggressive lesions a more radical approach may ultimately be necessary.

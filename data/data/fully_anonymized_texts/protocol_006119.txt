Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 5 1. Introduction  
This document describes the pla nned analysis that will be used for Study 150998-005 clinical 
study report. This randomized, parallel-group study is designed to assess the safety and 
efficacy of abicipar pegol (hereafter referred to  as abicipar) compared with ranibizumab in 
treatment-naïve patients with neovascular  age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). 
There will be two database locks. The first database lock (referred to as primary DBL) will 
occur when all patients have completed the Week  52 visit, or exited earlier. The study will be 
unmasked to a restricted group for primary analyses. 
The second database lock (referred to as fi nal DBL) will occur when all patients have 
completed the study entirely (Week 104 visit) or exited early from the study. 
The analysis plan will support both primary and final DBL, but some analyses will be 
reduced for the final DBL. For example, demogr aphic, baseline disease characteristics, and 
medical history will not be re-produced at the final DBL.  
1.1 Primary Study Objectives and Design  
The study objectives are to assess the safety  and efficacy of abicipar compared with 
ranibizumab in treatment-naïve patients with nAMD. 
The clinical hypotheses are: 
• Multiple intravitreal injections of [ADDRESS_528738] an acceptable safety profile in 
treatment-naïve patients with nAMD  
• The efficacy of at least 1 of the 2 abicipar regimens is noninferior to that of monthly 
ranibizumab intravitreal injec tions as assessed by [CONTACT_419304] 52 
This is a multicenter, double-masked, ra ndomized, 104-week, parallel-group, active-
controlled study to evaluate the safety and effi cacy of abicipar in treatment-naïve patients 
with nAMD. Approximately 900 patients will  be randomized by [CONTACT_244601] a 1:1:1 
allocation ratio to receive one of the following three treatments: • Treatment group 2Q8: 2 mg abicipar administer ed at baseline (Day 1) and Weeks [ADDRESS_528739]• T

Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 7 With an anticipated dropout rate of approximately 20% during a 52-week  period, a total of 
900 patients will be enrolled so that approximately 720 patients (240 per group) will 
complete 52 weeks as required for the primary endpoint evaluation. 
1.3 Database Lock and Procedur es of Maintaining Masking 
The study will be unmasked to a restricted group for the primary analysis following the 
Week 52 database lock. Access to randomization codes and unmasked information will be 
strictly limited to team members who will be working on data analysis, study report 
completion, and submission-related documents.  To maintain the integrity of the ongoing 
study, Allergan personnel who become unmasked after the Week 52 database lock will not 
participate in any masked activities during the re maining part of the study until after the final 
database lock at study completion. In part icular, the unmasked study statistician(s) and 
programmer(s) will no longer be involved in  any ongoing study conduct or data review 
activities. Other statisticians and programmers,  who are still masked to study treatment, will 
assume these responsibilities until study completion.  
2. Analysis Populations and Data Conventions  
2.1 Analysis Populations 
The following 3 populations will be used for stat istical analysis: intent-to-treat (ITT), per-
protocol (PP), and safety. 
The ITT population includes all randomized patie nts. The ITT population will be used for all 
efficacy analyses. The PP population includes all randomized and treated patients who do not have protocol 
deviations that impact the primary efficacy variable. The PP population will be used for 
analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy  variables. Primary considerations for PP 
definition include treatment compliance th at would represent the intended regimen 
adequately.  
Specifically, the PP population will include patients who 
1. Received at least 9 study treatments (inclu ding sham) and attended at least [ADDRESS_528742] year  (before the Week 52 visit), and; 
2. Had not missed 3 or more consecutive study treatments (including sham) before the  9
th 
study treatment, and; 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) [ADDRESS_528743] any major protocol deviations that impacted efficacy outcomes prior to the 
Week 52 visit   
The PP population will also include patients who discontinued from the study as a result of 
treatment failure without a major deviation prio r to Week 52 that impacted efficacy outcomes 
(even if they met criteria #1 or #2 above).  Patients who escaped to standard of care by 
[CONTACT_307660] [ADDRESS_528744] ratification that resulted in random ization under the wrong stratum, all 
PP analyses will be based on the actual stratum to which the patient belongs. ITT analysis 
that uses the randomization stratification factor (s) will be based on the stratum as randomized 
for the primary efficacy analysis and the actual stratum to which the patient belongs for other 
analyses such as model-based approaches. 
2.[ADDRESS_528745] ing to study days, which are defined in Table 1. 
Visit windows defined in Table 1 will be applied to all by-visit analyses of efficacy and safety 
variables. Out-of-window visits (including the exit visit) and unscheduled visits will be 
reassigned to the visit that th e actual study days fall within. 
In cases where multiple visits occurred within a single visit window, which resulted in multiple data points for the same window, the la st visit with non-missing data will be used 
for analysis.

2.4 Data Conventions  
Unless stated otherwise in specific subsequent  sections, data conventions and definitions 
listed below will be applied to all analyses. 
• Day [ADDRESS_528746] study treatment. 
Study day = visit date – date of the 1st study treatment + 1 
• For patients who were randomized but di d not receive any st udy treatments after 
randomization, the date of randomization will be used as Day 1. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 10 • Study duration will be calculated for each patient as: 
Study duration for the primary DBL = date of the Week 52 vis it (or early exit if 
discontinued before the primary DBL ) – date of the 1st study treatment + 1 
Study duration for the final DBL = date of the Week 104 visit (or early exit) – date of the 
1st study treatment + 1  
• Unless otherwise specified, baseline data refe r to assessments performed at the Baseline 
(Day 1) visit prior to the 1st study treatment. Screening or unscheduled visits prior to 
Day 1 visit will be used for baseline in the absence of pertinent data at the baseline visit. 
• If ungradable images result in missing baseli ne CRT, the manual read data for retinal 
thickness at the center point, if available, will be used for analysis. If the manual read 
data at baseline is not available, CRT on confirmation reading at screening will serve as 
baseline CRT. 
• Descriptive statistics include the sample size (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum (Min), and maximum (Max) for continuous/ordinal data and the frequency 
distribution includes sample size (N), freque ncy count, and percentage for categorical 
data. 
• The difference between groups will be calcu lated as abicipar minus ranibizumab. 
• Medical Dictionary of Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA) nomenclature will be used to 
code adverse events, medical procedures, biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy findings. 
• The Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical cl assification text from World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be us ed to code all medications for drug class 
and for drug name. 
• Whenever applicable, the metric system will be used (eg, kilograms [kg] and centimeters 
[cm]) and all clinical laboratory data will be  presented with the Standard International 
(SI) units. 
3. Disposition and Exit Status  
3.1 Disposition and Exit Status 
Patient disposition will be summarized as a frequency distribution by [CONTACT_419307]. For the Week 52 anal ysis, patients who are still in the study will 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 11 be classified into the ongoing category. Reasons for early exit will be summarized into the 
following categories as captur ed on the study exit eCRF. 
3.2 Significant Protocol Deviations  
Significant protocol deviations will be classified based on th e type of deviation for each 
treatment group. Summary of significant prot ocol deviations will be done for the ITT 
population.  
4. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
4.1 Demographics 
Demographic data are collected at the screening visit. Patient’s age (years), sex, and race will 
be summarized for each treatment group using the ITT and PP populations. Patient age will 
be classified into categories of less than or equal to 65 years and great er than 65 years.   
4.2 Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics include height (cm) , weight (kg), iris color, lesion type 
(predominantly classic, minimally classic, or oc cult), lesion size, subretinal or intraretinal 
fluid, intraretinal cysts, pi[INVESTIGATOR_70341], polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, 
and smoking status. Ocular char acteristics of the study eye at baseline include lens status, 
study eye as the better-seeing eye (defined as baseline BCVA study-eye  > BCVA non-study eye), 
BCVA, CRT, and intraocular pressure. Summaries of baseline characteristics will be done for 
the ITT and PP populations.   
4.3 Prior Medications/Procedures  
Prior medications are defined as those received prior to the first study treatment. For analysis 
purposes, a medication will be considered as a prior medication if it satisfies at least one of 
the following: 
• The start date is prior to Day 1, regardless of the stop date; 
• The start date is unknown but marked as > 1 year; or 
• The stop date is prior to or on Da y 1, regardless of the start date 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 12 For medications with a partial start or stop date  where > 1 year is not marked for the start 
date or ongoing is not marked for the stop da te and the day and/or the month is unknown, 
comparison to the 1st study treatment date (Day 1) will start with the year followed by [CONTACT_307662], if applicable, for determination of  prior medications. In cases where a full 
determination cannot be made based on the partial information, the start date will be assigned 
to the 1st day of the month if the day of the month is  missing or to January if the month of the 
year is missing; conversely, the stop date will be  assigned to the last day of the month if the 
day of the month is missing or to December if the month is missing. This missing data 
imputation will only be used to determine whether a certain medication is considered a prior 
medication. Prior medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_419308]. A separate analysis for prior ophthalmic medications used in the study eye 
will be performed based on WHODDE base preferred names. 
Summary of prior medications will be based on the ITT population. 
4.4 Concomitant Medications/Procedures  
Concomitant medications are defined as those non-study medications rece ived after the first 
study treatment. For analysis purposes, a medicati on will be considered as concomitant if it 
satisfies at least one of the following: 
• The start date is on or after the Day 1 treatment date regardless of the stop date;   
• The stop date is after the Day 1 treatment date, regardless of the start date; or 
• The stop date is unknown but marked as ongoing  
For medications with a partial start or stop date, the same conventions and algorithms as 
described for prior medications will be used for determination of concomitant medications. 
Concomitant medications will be summarized in the same way as prior medications.   
Concurrent procedures including those ocular  and nonocular procedures performed after 
study treatment will be coded using MedDRA. The number and percentage of patients with 
any concurrent procedures will be tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_220457] a frequency 
distribution for each primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. A separate 
summary for ocular concurrent procedur es in the study eye will be performed. 
The number and percentage of patients who escaped to standa rd-of-care will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_307664].

4.[ADDRESS_528747] ribution for each unique primary SOC and 
preferred terms using the ITT population ba sed on the following two categories: 
• Previous medical conditions, and 
• Medical conditions at study initiation 
Further, ocular history for the study eye will be summarized similarly. 
5. Efficacy Analyses  
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are listed below. Primary efficacy endpoint:  
• The proportion of patients with st able vision (ie, patients who lose fewer than 15 letters in 
BCVA) from baseline at Week 52 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
• Mean change from baseline in BCVA at Week 52 (key secondary endpoint) 
• Mean change from baseline in CRT as assessed with SD-OCT and quantified by [CONTACT_307666] 52 
• Proportion of patients with a gain of 15 or more ETDRS letters in BCVA from baseline at Week 52 
• Mean change from baseline in The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) composite score at Week 52 
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary endpoint for testing non-
inferiority will be performed using the PP popula tion. Analyses of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints for testing superiority wi ll be performed using the ITT population.  
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 14 5.1 Collection of Primary Efficacy Measurement and Derivation of 
Primary Efficacy Variable  
BCVA will be recorded on the CRF as the number of letters correctly read. For a given eye, 
the 4-meter distance (standard) of BCVA is tested first. If the patient correctly reads at least 
20 letters at 4 meters, BCVA score will be set as  the sum of 30 and the number of letters read 
correctly. If the patient correctly reads less than  20 letters at 4 meters, the BCVA is measured 
again at 1 meter. The BCVA score will be set to the number of letters read correctly at 1 meter plus the number of letters read corre ctly at 4 meters. For each patient, BCVA data 
will be collected for both eyes at the screening, baseline visit (Day 1 but prior to the study treatment), and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, 76, and 104/early exit visits; and for the study eye 
only at all other scheduled visits. 
For patients who received a ny non-study anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
treatments in the study eye, data after the [ADDRESS_528748] of Care eCRF, which states: “Loss of 
≥ 30 letters in BCVA from baseline (in any pos t-baseline visit), a nd persistent fluid 
(subretinal and intraretinal) by [CONTACT_63396], judged to be the cause of the BCVA loss (not explained 
by [CONTACT_307667]).” 
5.2.[ADDRESS_528749] to 
stable vision at Week 52 can be stated as follows: 
Null hypothesis: 
Abicipar (2Q12 or 2Q8) is inferior to ranibizumab by [CONTACT_307668]-inferiority margin of 
10% or more in the proportion of pat ients with stable vision at Week 52. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 15 Alternative hypothesis: 
Abicipar (2Q12 or 2Q8) is inferior to rani bizumab by [CONTACT_307669]-inferiority 
margin of 10% or is superior  to ranibizumab in the proportion of patients with stable vision 
at Week 52. 
The null and alternative hypotheses can be  mathematically stated as follows: 
Ho1:  P 2Q8 -  P rQ4 ≤  - 10%  
Ha1:  P 2Q8 -  P rQ4 >  - 10%  
And 
Ho2:  P 2Q12 -  P rQ4 ≤  - 10% 
Ha2: P2Q12 -  P rQ4 >  - 10% 
where P2Q8, P2Q12 , and PrQ4 are the probabilities of stable vision at Week 52 for the abicipar 
2Q8, abicipar 2Q12, and ranibizumab treatment groups, respectively.  
5.2.2 Primary Analyses of Primary Efficacy Variable  
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the PP 
population based on a stratified method with  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) weights. 
Within the framework of this method, the diff erence in the proportions between each abicipar 
arm and ranibizumab (abicipar group minus ranibizumab group) and the corresponding 
2-sided 95.1% confidence interval for non-inferi ority testing will be calculated. Specifically, 
the confidence intervals for treatment group di fferences will be calculated using the CMH 
weighted method with the baseline BCVA ( ≤ 55 versus > 55 ETDRS letters) as a 
stratification factor as de scribed in Yan and Su ( 2010). Missing data for BCVA will be 
imputed using the last observation carried fo rward (LOCF). The formal non-inferiority test 
will be performed at Week 52 with a non-inferiority  margin of 10% at an alpha level of 0.049. 
This alpha reflects an adjustment of 0.001 for the unmasked data review by [CONTACT_419309] (DSMC) for safety assessments. The total alpha spent of 0.001 for the 
DSMC is based on the assumption of no more  than 10 unmasked reviews during the study, 
with 0.0001 allocated to each review. Thus, the overall alpha for the study is preserved at 0.05 level.

model for repeated measures (MMRM), which in cludes BCVA data from baseline (Day 1) to 
Week 52. The model will include treatment gr oup, region, baseline BCVA in the study eye, 
baseline CRT ( ≤ 400 µm or > 400 µm) in the study eye, lesion type of choroidal 
neovascularization (predominantly classic versus minimally classic or occult) from the 
confirmation at screening, visit, visit-by-baseline BCVA interaction, and treatment-by-visit 
interaction as fixed covariates using an unstructured covariance matrix. The difference in 

Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 19 BCVA mean change from baseline between each  abicipar arm and ranibizumab (abicipar 
group minus ranibizumab group) and the corresponding 2-sided 95.1% confidence interval 
(CI) will be calculated based on the MMRM mode l. The formal non-inferiority test will be 
performed at Week 52 using a margin of 5 letters. Non-inferiority of abicipar will be established if the lower limit of the CI is > - 5.0 letters. Testing for non-inferiority in mean 
change will also be performed using the ITT population and the same MMRM model as a sensitivity analysis. 
Testing for superiority of abicipar over ranibizumab in BCVA mean change will be 
performed using the ITT population with the same MMRM model.   
As a sensitivity analysis, BCVA mean change  will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model, which includes the treatment group, region, baseline CRT 
(≤ 400 or > 400 microns), and lesion type of choroidal neovasculari zation (predominantly 
classic versus minimally classic or occult) from  the confirmation at screening as fixed effects 
and baseline BCVA as a covariate. In this model, missing data will be replaced by [CONTACT_419311]. Treatment differences between each 
abicipar group and ranibizumab and the corr esponding 2-sided 95.1% confidence intervals 
for the difference will be calculated based on the least–square means and appropriate 
contrasts from the same ANCOVA model. 
Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_307655] [IP_ADDRESS] will be performed for BCVA change 
using the PP population. The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_419302] δ
2Q8, δ2Q12, or δrQ4 that resulted in a lower bound of the 95.1% CI for the difference 
of abicipar (2Q8 or 2Q12) minus ranibizumab less than -[ADDRESS_528751] images will be evaluated and graded by [CONTACT_419312] (FPRC). The graded results will  be captured on the evaluation form and used 
for statistical analysis. In th e event of excess fluid at baseline and ungradable images that 
result in missing baseline CRT, the manual read data for retinal thickness at the center point, 
if available, will be used for analysis. 
CRT is measured as the thickness of the subfields, which is the central 1000 µm from the 
center of the fovea. 
Analysis of CRT mean change from baseline  in the study eye will be performed using the 
same MMRM model for superiority testing based on the ITT population  as described in 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 20 Section 5.3.1 for the key efficacy variable of BCVA change. The only difference is that 
baseline CRT will be included in the model as a continuous variable instead of a dichotomy 
(eg, ≤ 400 µm or > 400 µm) as used for randomization.   
5.3.3 BCVA Improvement of ≥ 15 Letters from Baseline  
The proportion of patients with a BCVA improvement of ≥ 15 letters from baseline in the 
study eye at each postbaseline visit will be calculated for each trea tment group. Between-
group comparisons and the 95.1% confidence in tervals for the between-group difference will 
be performed using the same method as described for the primary efficacy variable in 
Section 5.2.2 for superiority testing using the ITT population.  
5.3.4 NEI-VFQ-25 Mean Change from Ba seline in Composite Score  
The NEI-VFQ-25 will be administered at the Base line/Day 1, and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, 76, 
and 104/early exit visits. Detailed analyses and analysis visit windows are described in 
Section 7 for health outcome data analysis. 
As a secondary efficacy variable, change from baseline at Week 52 in the overall composite 
score will be analyzed for superiority testing using the ITT population and MMRM as 
described in Section 5.3.1 for the key secondary efficacy variable of BCVA change. The 
model will include the treatment group, region, baseline BCVA in the study eye, baseline VFQ score, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed covariates using an unstructured 
covariance matrix. Treatment differences and the corresponding 95.1% confidence intervals 
will be constructed using the MMRM model.

Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 24 6.2 Adverse Events  
A TEAE is an adverse event th at occurs after the initiation of the study treatment (ie, the 
onset date is the same as or after the study tr eatment date), or an adverse event with onset 
prior to the study treatment that worsened in seve rity or became serious after the initiation of 
the study treatment. The incidence of TEAEs  will be calculated by [CONTACT_419314].   
The following summaries of TEAE data will be performed: 1) ove rall summary, 2) all 
TEAEs regardless of causality, 3) treatment -related TEAEs, 4) ocular TEAEs (study eye 
versus non-study eye), 5) nonocular TEAEs, 6)  treatment-related ocular TEAEs, and 7) 
TEAEs of special interest. An additional summary will be provided for 8) treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (TE SAEs) and 9) AEs leading to study discontinuation. 
The 1) overall summary will present the number and percentage of patients with TEAEs, 
ocular/nonocular TEAEs in the study eye, treatment-related ocular/nonocular TEAEs, AEs 
leading to study discontinuation, TE SAEs, a nd death in each treatment group. Treatment-
related ocular TEAEs will also be summarized for injection-related and drug-related TEAEs. 
Injection-related TEAEs are those TEAEs marked as rela ted to the study treatment 
administration. 
Further, tabulations of TEAEs or TE SAEs based on MedDRA coded terms, primary system 
organ class (SOC) and/or preferred terms (PTs) will be sorted by [CONTACT_307674]. 
• Summary for 3) treatment-related TEAEs, 5)  nonocular TEAEs, 8) TE SAEs, and 9) AEs 
leading to study discontinuation will be sorted  by [CONTACT_307675]. 
Within each SOC name, TEAEs (TE SAEs or AE s) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_307676]. A patient with multiple occurrences of the same PT within the reporting period will 
be counted only once for that PT.   
• Summary for 2) TEAEs by [CONTACT_419315] (maximum severity ) experienced for a given patient. Within 
each SOC, TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_419316]. The 
severity of a TEAE is defined as the greater of the onset severity and maximum severity 
recorded on the CRF for each unique PT reported by [CONTACT_102]. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 25 • Summary for 4) ocular TEAEs, 6) treatment-related ocular TEAEs, and 7) TEAEs of 
special interest of intraocular inflammation will be sorted by [CONTACT_419317]. A patient with multiple occurrences of the same preferred term within the reporting 
period will be counted only once for that PT. 
All tabulations will be sorted in descending order of frequency following this sequence from left to right: starting from abicipar groups 2Q 8, 2Q12, and ranibizumab every 4 weeks (rQ4).  
For the Week 52 analysis, AEs reported from ba seline to Week 52 will be determined by [CONTACT_307680]: 
• For patients who completed the Week 52 vi sit, include AEs with an onset date ≤ Week 52 
visit date 
• For patients who did not complete the Week 52 visit due to early dropout or missed visit, 
include AEs with an onset date ≤ [ADDRESS_528753] include intraocular inflammation and those potentially related to 
systemic VEGF inhibition. TEAEs related to systemic VEGF inhibition will be categorized 
as arterial-thromboembolic events (ATEs, defi ned as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or vascular death [including d eaths of unknown cause]), hypertension, nonocular 
hemorrhage, proteinuria, and others. Data for these two types of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_17148]. 
TEAEs included in the intraocular inflammati on table will follow a two-step selection 
process: first to identify the MedDRA prefe rred terms that may represent an intraocular 
inflammation followed by a thorough medical review  of any relevant details reported for the 
adverse event including ocular examination findi ngs. The incidence of TEAEs for intraocular 
inflammation of special interest  will be summarized by [CONTACT_419318]. TEAEs identified based on MedDRA preferred terms but 
not considered as intraocular inflammation of special interest will be displayed in a separate 
data listing. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-005 Analysis Plan 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-005 CSR (Amendment 2) 26 TEAEs included in the events potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition table will be 
identified following the same process. A summ ary for arterial thromboembolic events or 
other adverse events that are pot entially related to systemic VEGF inhibition will be done by 
[CONTACT_419319], hypertension, nonocular hemorrhage, proteinuria, and others 
by [CONTACT_73972]. 
In addition, TEAEs potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition will be summarized 
separately for patients who received the fo llowing anti-VEGF injections in the non-study 
eye: ranibizumab, bevacizumab,  pegaptanib, and aflibercept. 
The selection and review of all TEAEs of special interest will be performed in a masked 
fashion and finalized prior to database lock and study unmasking.

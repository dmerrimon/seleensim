This amendment to the exclusion criteria is based on the rationale 
that body surface area should not preclude potential patients from 
partici pating in this study, as the appropriate dosing of the 
hydrocortisone through the pump is not based on the child's body surface area. Use of the pump is based on the need of the volume 
of hydrocortisone that can be delivered through the infusion pump. To ensure the pump volume is being met, the investigator(s) will review the standard total daily dose and calculate the needed 
dosing for each patient's pump volume. If the appropriate volume 
for dosage cannot be reached with the pump, the child will be excluded from participation until that minimum volume can be met.

8 1 Introduction  
 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency is a rare form of adrenal 
insufficiency with a prevalence of 1:16,000,1 characterized by [CONTACT_503129]. The currently recommended oral hydrocortisone (HC) 
therapy for children with CAH2 is unsatisfactory because it results in alternating hypo-  and 
hypercortisolemia3,4, thereby [CONTACT_503130]. 
Hypocortisolemia triggers  increased production of 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) and the 
adrenal androgen androstenedione (D4A), which can lead to premature fusion of the growth plates, 
genital virilization, precocious puberty, adrenal rests, polycystic ovarian syndrome and infert ility.5-[ADDRESS_647907] long- term effects such as osteoporosis, short stature, and 
increased risk for cardiovascular disease in adulthood.10-16 Current oral therapy is suboptimal due to 
resulting non- physiologic levels of cortis ol and the inability to replicate circadian and ultradian cortisol 
secretion rhythms associated with normal adrenal function.17-26 Therefore, an improved and 
personalized drug delivery system is needed27 which more closely replicates physiological pulsatile 
cortisol secretion and limits periods of hyper - and hypocortisolemia in children with a resul ting tighter 
control of adrenal androgens.   
 Various strategies to “optimize” glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy include modified or 
dual-release preparations,28,29 continuous  subcutaneous (SQ) infusions30-33 and personalized 
treatment based on oral cortisol pharmacokinetic (PK) and 17OHP and D4A pharmacodynamic (PD) 
response studies.  However, none of these strategies addresses that endogenous GCs are released 
in a pulsatile  manner and that this ultradian rhythm is important in maintaining homeostatic control 
through GC receptor -dependent transcriptional regulation, which rapi[INVESTIGATOR_503105].17-20,25,[ADDRESS_647908] clinical trial in children with CAH of a SQ 
hydrocortisone (SQHC) pump that will mimic pulsatility through interval bolus delivery system.  An 
open- label, non- randomized crossover design will be used for this proof -of-concept study  to inform 
the design of a larger clinical trial. Our long term goal is to improve clinical outcomes in children 
with CAH through optimizing the dosing and scheduling of replacement therapy and avoid the 
hyperandrogenemia that is specific to CAH. This study's objective is to demonstrate that a SQHC 
pump with interval bolus delivery more closely replicates circadian and ultradian rhythms of cortisol 
and improves control of adrenal androgens. Our  study's rationale is that cortisol profiles more 
consistent  with physiologic rhythms of cortisol secretion will produce better health outcomes.

9 2 Background and Significance  
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and the inadequacy of current therapy.  
 
Classic CAH due to 21 -hydroxylase 
deficiency (21OHD) is a rare form of adrenal 
insufficiency (prevalence 1:16,000)1 
characterized by [CONTACT_503131] . Normally, in the 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis  a 
negative feedback loop exists wherein 
cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH) are in a state of dynamic equilibrium. 
Hypocortisolemia in CAH leads to ACTH -
driven adrenal gland stimulation where cortisol precursors, such as 17-
hydroxyprogesterone ( 17OHP), are shunted 
to the androgen pathway as androgen 
synthesis does not require the 21 -
hydroxylase enzyme. In turn, this leads to 
excess production of adrenal androgens 
such as androstenedione (D4A) and testost erone (T) ( Fig. 1) .
38 Elevated D 4A and T in utero and 
postnatally can cause masculinization of the external genitalia in both sexes. Untreated or poorly 
controlled females will continue to masculinize which in turn can lead to extensive and multiple 
corrective genital surgeries ( Fig. 2 ). 
Patients with CAH require life -long glucocorticoid replacement. 
The main treatment challenge for CAH is to find the right balance 
of delivering sufficient glucocorticoid replacement to suppress overproduction of adrenal androgens (hyperandrogenemia), 
while avoiding the effects of glucocorticoid excess 
(hypercortisolemia). The current CAH consensus guidelines recommend treating children with oral hydrocortisone (HC; 
cortisol) at a dose of 10 -15 mg/m
2/day given 3 times per day.2 
Response to HC therapy and disease control is evaluated by 
[CONTACT_503132] 17OHP and/or D4A at clinic visit s only 
every 3 to 6 months along with clinical impressions including 
growth velocity, weight gain, blood pressure, pubertal development and bone age maturation .2 This 
practice provides limited information  for several reasons: 1) C linical findings reflect current drug 
therapy and adverse findings are a consequence of chronic over - and under - exposure to cortisol 
and androgen.  While these findings may indicate the current HC regimen is inadequate, it does not 
indicate which specific aspects of the regimen (dose, timing, frequency) need to be changed. 2) 
Obtaining 17OHP and D4A concentrations three to four times a year does not provide a complete 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_503106]. T hese biomarkers are in a state of dynamic equilibrium in response to the 
HC dosing regimen and its  negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. Blood samples obtained at 
various times after a dose can lead to highly variable concentrations, thereby [CONTACT_503133] 17OHP and D4A. 3) Single biomarker determinations only provide assessment of 
control at a single point in time and do not imply control over 24 hours.  

Interval Bolus Delivery of Cortisol in Children with CAH  
 
 
Version date: September 20, 2021   Confidential  
10 Another challenge  with HC therapy is its short median elimination half -life in CAH children of 58 min 
(range: 41 -105 min) allowing most of the HC dose to be eliminated from the body within 4- 5 hrs.3,39 
This is of particular concern as the cortisol concentration from the evening HC dose washes out over 
night resulting in unopposed ACTH -stimulated adrenal androgen production and significant 
hyperandrogenemia each morning when ACTH is at its peak  
(~0600). Because of HC’s short half life, the recommended 3 
times a day dosing schedule is inadequate and children are 
inevitably exposed to alternating periods of hypo-  and 
hypercortisolemia throughout each day ( Fig. 3). 
Hypocortisolemia leading to hyperandrogenemia, besides 
causing genital virilization, can also lead to premature fusion 
of the growth plates, precocious puberty, adrenal rests, 
polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility and endothelial 
dysfunction.5-9,[ADDRESS_647909] long -
term effects, such as osteoporosis, s hort stature, insulin 
resistance and increased risk for cardiovascular disease.10-12,14-16,44,45 Increasing the challenge of 
treatment is the interindividual variability of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) response to HC due to variations in glucocorticoid receptor and tissue sensitivity.
3,46,47 For example, 
about 7% of the general population harbor polymorphisms in the human glucocorticoid receptor that 
enhance responsiveness to GCs.48  
 
Furthermore, cortisol PK in children with CAH differ from those  individuals with other forms of adrenal 
insufficiency as their intermittently increased adrenal sex steroid production throughout the day could 
alter the enzyme activity of 11β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β -HSD) isoenzymes and other 
enzymes that have a role in cortisol metabolism.49-51 The interindividual cortisol PKPD variability and 
the shortcomings of the current recommended therapy and associated adverse clinical 
outcomes10,11,52 underscore the importance of examining new ways of cortisol delivery that account 
for the inherently dynamic patterns of cortisol secretion and individual cortisol  PK and 17OHP and 
D4A PD responses.

11 The importance of GC pulsatility for normal function of the hypothalamic- pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal 
(HPA) axis. The HPA axis is characterized by [CONTACT_503134]. 
Cortisol secretion has a classically circadian pattern: 
cortisol levels reach nadir at midnight, begin to rise 
around 0200 hrs, peak early in the morning (cortisol 
awakening response) and gradually decrease throughout the day.
53,54 The circadian cortisol secretion pattern is 
actually derived from a dynamic ultradian rhythm of discrete cortisol pulses that follow ACTH pulses
55-57, with 
larger and more frequent pulses occurring early in the morning.
53,57 In humans, secretory pulses of cortisol 
occur every 80– 110 min.17,19,55,57,58 The mean number of 
pulses in 18 healthy subjects was 12±0.7, and the circadian and ultradian pattern of cortisol concentrations 
(lower panel) and derived cortisol secretory rate (upper 
panel) is shown for a representative volunteer in Fig. 4 .
57 
Ultradian cortisol rhythms can be generated through a 
mechanism independent of input from the hypothalamic circadian pacemaker (suprachiasmatic nucleus)
26 and 
are evolutionarily conserved across mammals, 
supporting the importance of pulsatility in normal GC signaling.59-61  
Pulsatile access of glucocorticoids to their receptors has been previously shown in vitro  and in vivo 
in animal models to  be of critical importance for gene regulation, non -genomic glucocorticoid 
signaling, HPA axis regulation, and endocrine and behavioral responses.23,25,62-64,22 Pulsatile 
changes in plasma GC levels result in gene pulsing mediated by [CONTACT_503135], which rapi[INVESTIGATOR_503107]. Conversely, constant, non- oscillatory hormone 
levels result in continuous transcription, aberrant mRNA accumulation, abnormal protein levels, and 
GC resistance.
25,59 Rodent experiments show a differential c -fos r esponse in the amygdala, 
hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex depending on a constant versus pulsatile pattern of GC presentation, underscoring the significance of gene pulsing.
23 The different and often completely 
opposite effects of pulsatile vs continuous hormone presentation is well described in other hormone systems. For example, pulsatile delivery of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) induces ovulation
[ADDRESS_647910] to use subcutaneous (SQ) hydrocortisone (HC) pump 
with interval bolus delivery to provide both circadian rhythm and ultradian pulsatility in children with 
CAH.  
 
Alternative GC delivery modalities tested so far do not address cortisol pulsatility. Recent 
efforts to improve treatment of patients with adrenal insufficiency have focused on continuous  SQHC 
infusions and modified release oral GC preparations, with mixed results. Studies, nearly all in adults,

Version date: September 20, [ADDRESS_647911] shown that SQHC via a pump is safe and can closely mimic the circadian rhythm.30-33,67 Oksnes 
et al., found no differences in height, weight, blood pressure, and sleep patterns between oral and 
SQHC therapy, although Health Related Quality of  Life was improved with SQHC.31 Gagliardi et al., 
found no improvement  in subjective health status.32 A recent study in 8 adults by [CONTACT_503136], et al, found 
that that continuous SQHC was a well -tolerated and safe modality of HC replacement over 6 months 
resulting in improved adrenal steroid control and positive effects on quality of life and fatigue.67 The 
study concluded earlier (childhood) intervention strategies are needed. Although all three studies 
tried to replicate circadian rhythm, they did not address pulsat ile, ultradian rhythm of cortisol 
secretion. Johannson et al . showed modest improvement in blood pressure and weight reduction 
with a dual -release HC tablet therapy compared to immediate- release HC at the same daily dose 
(despi[INVESTIGATOR_503108]) but  patients were hypocortisolemic in the evening and early morning

3 Objective s 
3.1 Primary Objectives  
 
1. To implement an interval bolus SQHC dosing regimen that more closely mimics cortisol, 17OHP and D4A circadian and ultradian rhythms than conventional oral HC dosing. Up to twelve  children (eight analyzable)  with CAH, ages [ADDRESS_647913] 24- hr 
PKPD profiles of cortisol, 17OHP and D4A serum concentrations measured while on oral HC 
therapy (admission 1), during an initial trial of the SQHC pump (admission 2), and after 6 
weeks of SQHC pump treatment (admission 3). An integrated PKPD  model will be used to 
determine cortisol, 17OHP and D4A parameters to compare the duration of time subjects 
have these concentrations outside their acceptable ranges.  
Hypothesis 1:  Duration of hypocortisolemia and hypercortisolemia will be significantly shorter on 
SQHC pump therapy (admissions 2 and 3) than with conventional oral HC dosing (admission 1).  
Hypothesis 2: Duration of time 17OHP and D4A serum concentrations are outside an acceptable 
range of suppression will be significantly shorter while on the SQHC pump (admissions 2 and 3) than with oral dosing (admission 1).

13 3.2 Secondary/Exploratory Objectives  
1. Physical activity levels: Daily activity and sleep patterns will be assessed by [CONTACT_503137] (Pensacola, FL) for 7 full days  (5 weekdays and 2 weekend 
days) during each study period.    
 
2. Quality of Life and cognitive measures: Quality of life (QoL) measures including NIH 
toolbox will be measured four times during the study (baseline, and once during each study 
period).  QoL will be measured through the validated PedsQL™ Generic Core Scale and 
the PedsQL™ Fatigue Scale. NIH Toolbox Cognitive Tasks: We will use NIH Toolbox 
Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (DCCS) from the computer -administered NIH Toolbox 
to measure children’s attention and executive functioning and cognitive flexibility, along with 
the Flanker Inhibitory Control & Attention Test  A validated sleep and mood survey will also 
be administered.  
 
3. This proposal will include a utility assessment of a real -time (20 minut es) noninvasive point -
of-care salivary testing device [VerOFy® cortisol (VCORT)] in a home setting. While we are 
not using VCORT to make dosing decisions or diagnoses and formal monitoring will be 
accomplished using serum cortisol sampling within the protocol, we believe it is important 
to determine the utility of such a device.  
 
4. An analysis to determine whether PKPD  system parameters change with the switch in the 
route of HC administration from oral to SQHC pump, and after six weeks of SQHC treatment. A p referred pharmacometric analysis for this outcome is to use nonlinear mixed-
effects (NLME) regression modeling to estimate PKPD  parameters from all data at weeks 
1, 7 and 14 simultaneously.   
 
 
 
4 Study Design  
This is an open -label, non- randomized crossover feasibility trial which will compare oral HC 
administration with SQHC pump administration in pediatric patients with CAH.  Up to twelve children 
(eight analyzable)  with CAH, ages 3-[ADDRESS_647914] serial cortisol, 17OHP , ACTH  and D4A 
serum concentrations determined over 24 hours while taking conventional oral therapy (Admission 
1).  
 
Admission 2 will serve three purposes: a 33- hr SQHC pump evaluation period, patient and parent 
training with the pump, and a 24- hr PKPD study. During admission 2, we will use each patient’s total 
daily dose (TDD) of HC to determine the doses to be delivered during the 33- hr period. The 24 -hr 
schedule and percentage of the TDD of HC will be as follows: approximately 60% of the TDD of HC 
will be delivered in 3 equal pulses at 0300, 0600 and 0900. Another 35% will be delivered in 3 equal 
pulses at 1200, 1500 and 1800 and the remaining 5% at 2100 and 2400. Following delivery of the 
9:00 pm, 12:00 am, and 3:00 am pulses, a 24- hr PKPD study will be initiated at the 6:[ADDRESS_647915] 
will be sent home on their usual oral HC dosing regimen.  
 After th e SQHC pump therapy PKPD  study during admission 2 at week 7, an analysis of the pattern 
of concentrations will be performed as a safety check. If the cortisol or adrenal steroid concentrations

Version date: September 20, 2021   Confidential  
14 are generally within acceptable ranges (defined in Aim 1), the same pump settings will be used when 
initiating the ambulatory pump phase at week 9. If concentrations are outside acceptable ranges, 
the initial SQHC pump settings will be adjusted from the Admission 2 dosing as needed to attain 
acceptable concentration ranges. Individual pulse doses may be increased or decreased but the 
frequency of pulses will be fixed to every 3 hours.  After determining appropriate SQHC pump 
settings, the subjects will return to clinic at week 9 to initiate the 6 -week SQHC ambulatory pump 
therapy phase.  
  
6-WEEK PUMP TREATMENT  
All subcutaneous pump settings of hydrocortisone (timing and dose) can only be set by [CONTACT_41314]. The SQ infusion site will be changed every [ADDRESS_647916] will be evaluated 
for appropriate site for SQ infusion (i.e. gluteal area, abdominal area)  to ensure proper placement. . 
A clinician will establish contact [CONTACT_503138]. All patients will be seen 
at home twice each week during the first and second week at the time of injection site changes and 
once a week thereafter while on the pump to evaluate proficiency in changing the injection site; to collect blood for cortisol, 17OHP, ACTH, and D4A concentrations; and to inspect the injection site 
integrity.  
 Dose Adjustments During Pump Therapy. During the 6- week pump treatment, multiple cortisol, D4A , 
ACTH and 17OHP concentrations will become available and they may  suggest, along with clinical 
impressions, that the pump dosing setting needs to be revised. It is critical to note that subjects will not be required to stay on the initial dosing schedule for [ADDRESS_647917] of care for pediatric CAH patients. Should incongruous information be 
observed, clinical impressions take precedence along with D4A concentrations, and then 17OHP 
concentration. Cortisol concentrations are not  generally part of routine patient care and will play a 
lesser role in dosing changes. The changes in dose settings may involve increasing or decreasing 
the HC TDD, or perhaps changing the percentage of TDD administered at a given time, but the 3 -hr 
dosing  intervals will remain fixed.    
  
A 24 -hr PKPD study will be performed during admission 3 (week 14) using the same sampling 
schedule as admission 2.  
 
5 Subjects  
5.1 Study Setting  
There will be three admissions and three outpatient visits held at Nucleus Network (formerly Prism Clinical Research ), a 52-bed early phase research site that specializes in complex, phase I and II 
clinical trials in healthy and numerous patient volunteer populations including pediatrics. It is located within 1 mile from the University of Minnesota campus.    Aside from close proximity to the 
University of Minnesota, Nucleus Network ( Prism Research) is located in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503109]/St. Paul Metropolitan area with easy access for all residents to the facility as well as 
ample free parking for clinical research subjects.

and collaborative trials with University of Minnesota Faculty. Nucleus Network ( Prism Clinical 
Research) staff are trained in pediatric phlebotomy.  Volunteers and their guardians will be 
provided a private bedroom with satellite television and wireless internet access that is convenient 
for both children and their guardians. Nucleus Network (formerl y Prism Research ) also provides 
games and movies suitable for all ages.    
5.2 Eligibility Criteria  
A total of 12 children (6 boys and 6 girls), aged 3- 18 years, may be enrolled on this study , to 
ensure available analysis of 8 completed participants . This study  entry is open to children 
regardless of gender or ethnic background.  
5.2.1  Inclusion Criteria 
• Children 3 - 18 years of age.  
• Classic CAH as confirmed by [CONTACT_503139]. 
• Patients who have been on the same HC dosing regimen for 1 month  
5.2.2   Exclusion Criteria 
• Patients with non- classic CAH.  
• Patients on:  
o Dexamethasone 
o Prednisone, or  
o inhaled steroids.  
• Patients with total daily dose of HC dosing regimen (min 10 mg) that cannot meet 
the required smallest volume to be delivered by [CONTACT_1709] ( 0.2 mg )  
• Non-English speaking patients  
Inclusion of Children  
The proposed study will enroll children 3- 18 years of age. Justification for the inclusion of children 
in this study includes: 1) relevance of the disease to the pediatric population; 2) subcutaneous infusion pumps are currently used in the pediatric population to treat diabetes; 3) hydrocortisone 
succinate, the injectable form of oral hydrocortisone that will be used for hydrocortisone delivery in the subcutaneous infusion pumps, is currently used intramuscularly at home for children with CAH for emergency treatment or when children are sick and unable to take their medicine orally; 4) 
subcutaneous continuous delivery of hydrocortisone succinate has been used in adults with 
adrenal insufficiency and in an adolescent with CAH and was well tolerated and safe (Lovas and 
Husebye, Eur J Endocrinol, 2007; Gagliardi, et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2014; Oksnes, et al, J 
Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2014; Bryan, et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2009); 5) pulsatile delivery of 
hydrocortisone succinate was performed in normal adults without adverse effects in a study 
conducted by [CONTACT_503140] (Russell, et al., Clin Endocrinol, 2014); 6) The Crono P ambulatory subcutaneous infusion pump (CANÈ S.p.A. Medical Technology, Italy) 
used in [CONTACT_503155]’s study is the only pump specifically designed for preprogrammed 
(bolus) delivery of glucocorticoids. Inclusion of children in this trial is in accordance with 45 CFR 
part 46.406— research involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct benefit to 
individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subject's disorder or 
condition.

17 Access to Participants : Participants have been fully informed of the ways in which their data 
will/may be used during the informed consent process. The research team has been trained in 
conducting these conversations and the participants are also assessed for their understanding of 
consent prior to signing the consent form or initiating any study procedures  
 
Consent Process  
 
Consent forms describing in detail the study procedures, and risks are given to the participant and 
written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering 
study product.  Consent will take place at CAH clinic at the University of Minnesota Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35905] a private and confidential room. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review 
the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants will be given the 
opportunity to take the consent home to discuss with family and caregivers and return on a 
subsequent day to sign the consent and enroll in the study.  Informed consent is a process  that is 
initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation 
will be provided to the participants and t heir families. Consent forms will be IRB -approved and the 
participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain the 
research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will 
receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, 
and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The 
participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with others or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at any 
time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by 
[CONTACT_34693].    
 Consent Process for Participants Who Are Not Yet Adults (infants, children, teenagers under 18 
years of age ): Prior to screening for the study each participant and parent(s)/legal guardian will be 
informed in detail about the study with its risks and discomforts to be expected. A written parental 
permission will be obtained from each patient to be involved in the clinical trial by [CONTACT_320406] -
approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to the conduct of any study -related activity. Each 
participant will be given a copy of the written ICF. The participants will also be instructed that they 
are free to withdraw their consent and discontinue their participation in the study at any time.  The 
assent from the child or adolescent will be obtained when this is appropriate and when the 
potential participant is capable of providing assent. The determination of appropr iateness and 
capacity of children in the study to provide assent is made by [CONTACT_978].  For clinical investigations 
involving greater than minimal risk, permission is generally required from both parents unless only 
one parent has legal custody, or one parent  is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably 
available.  
 
Compensation for Research- Related Injury  
 
In the event that this research activity results in an injury, treatment will be available, including first 
aid, emergency treatment and follow -up care as needed.  Care for such injuries will be billed in the 
ordinary manner, to the participant or his/her insurance company.

6.1 Screening/Baseline  
Once consent has been obtained, the following tests and procedures will be done to determi ne if 
the subject is eligible:  
• Physical Exam  
• Medical History  
 
A subject diary will be provided after consent. This diary will be used by [CONTACT_503141] & symptoms, adverse events, medications and dosing.  
6.2 Treatment period (weeks 1 -20) 
6.2.1  Weeks 1 -8 (Oral HC) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Week [ADDRESS_647921]’s usual doses will be administered at 3 
standardized dosing times for the PKPD study: 0600, 1200 and 1800. Cha nges from usual dosing 
times are expected to be small and inconsequential for the patient. I mmediately prior to the 
morning dose at 6am, a 3-mL blood sample will be obtained for quantification of cortisol, 17 OHP, 
ACTH and D4A.  Samples will then be obtained at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 (noon) hrs after the first 
dose. The same sampling intervals will be used following the 1200 and 1800 doses, with additional samples collected during the night at 0200, 0400 and 0600. The total blood volume over 36 hrs will 
be 75 ml, which is well within the acceptable blood volume for this patient population and age 
range. If a patient is <35 kg, the blood draw will be adjusted based on weight. Also during 
admission, a 24- hour urine collection will be performed and an aliquo t of 20mLwill be extracted 
from two timed 12 hour timed urine collections over the course of 24 hours. Urine samples will be 
stored under PI [INVESTIGATOR_503112]. The IRB will be notified of these 
analyses when determined. In addition, a total of six saliva samples will be collected at: 0600 (prior 
to first dose), 0700, 1200 (prior to second dose), 1300, 1800 (prior to third dose) and 1900. 
Salivary samples will be sent to Quest Diagnostics for adrenal steroid measurements throug h LC -
MS/MS assay. After processing, any remaining saliva samples (during week 1 and the remainder 
of the study) will be retained by [CONTACT_503142], per subject/family consent. The nurse

19 [IP_ADDRESS]  Week  7 (SQHC Pump 33 hours)  
 
At week 7, subjects will be re -admitt ed for Crono P subcutaneous HC (SQHC) infusion pump 
training in which the device will be used for 33 hrs and include a 24- hr PKPD  study while on the 
SQHC pump. Training will emphasize proper aseptic catheter placement, care of the insertion site, 
reconstit uting the solution and filling the infusion syringe. HC sodium succinate ( SOLU -CORTEF) 
sterile powder will be used for the SQHC pump as it is FDA approved for intramuscular and intravenous routes for CAH and Addison's disease. HC sodium succinate comes in a two -
compartment vial (Act -O-Vial) containing a 100 mg dose in the lower compartment and 2 ml sterile 
water in the upper compartment (100 mg/2 ml). Parents will be instructed to further dilute the 
solution with another 8 ml of 0.9% normal salineinto the i nfusion syringe, for a final concentration 
of 100 mg/10 ml (10 mg/ml). Parents will be trained to visually inspect the HC sodium succinate 
solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The parents of the children seen at the CAH 
Center are already fam iliar with the [ADDRESS_647924] a physical exam. Pump therapy during this admission wi ll begin at 9 pm and 
continue for 33 hours. We will use each patient’s total daily dose (TDD) of HC to determine the 
doses to be delivered during the 33- hr period. The 24- hr schedule and percentage of the TDD of 
HC will be as follows: approximately 60% of the TDD of HC will be delivered in 3 equal pulses at 0300, 0600 and 0900. Another 35% will be delivered in 3 equal pulses at 1200, 1500 and 1800 and 
the remaining 5% at 2100 and 2400. Following delivery of the 9:00 pm, 12:00 am, and 3:00 am 
pulses, a 24- hr PKPD  study will be initiated at the 6:[ADDRESS_647925] admission beginning at 0600. Saliva samples will be collected at the sam e time points 
as in admission 1 (0600, 0700, 1200, 1300, 1800, and 1900) irrespective of dosing. Salivary 
samples will be sent to Quest Diagnostics for adrenal steroid measurements through LC -MS/MS 
assay.     
 
Subjects and families will be given and instructed on how to use an automatic, upper arm blood 
pressure monitor with a cuff appropriate for the child’s size. Subjects will begin monitoring of daily blood pressure upon discharge (see section 9.3 for instructions), to week 13. The staff will review 
adverse events, medications and the subject’s dairy. The Actigraph will be returned at this visit.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Week s 7-8 
 After completing the 24 -hr PKPD  study, subjects will be discharged from the research facility and 
continue on their usual HC oral dosing schedule for  1 week prior to initiation of the SQHC pump. 
During this time,  cortisol, 17OHP, and D4A concentrations will be analyzed to determine that the 
pump has delivered HC as expected and cortisol, 17OHP, and D4A concentrations are in an 
acceptable range. SQHC wi ll be recalculated as needed before initiating the pump if cortisol, 
17OHP, or D4A concentrations are not generally in a desired range.

and the nurse coordinator will review the patient’s recorded daily blood pressure, subject diary, 
adverse events and any medications taken.  It is our standard policy to make sure that families 
have parent eral hydrocort isone to use during emergencies. We will instruct the patients to call [CONTACT_503159] before administering any parent eral dose during this phase. After the first four 
supervised home visits by [CONTACT_202755], the family , as instructed  will replace t he HC 
infusion syringe and solution, and the site of SQ infusion every [ADDRESS_647928] will be eval uated for appropriate site for SQ infusion 
(i.e. gluteal area, abdominal area). .  Parents will be instructed to visually inspect the parenteral HC 
solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration into the pump.  
 
After the outpatient visit, during week 9, the subject/family will be called on the days that the RN 
coordinator is not completing home visits. This call is the review pump use, adverse events and 
other questions or concerns.  
 
Weeks 9- 13: The nurse coordinator will visit subjects at home seven times for safety monitoring, 
which includes a nursing assessment , and measurement of cortisol, 17OHP , ACTH  and D4A 
concentrations  during the SQHC pump period. During the home visits, along with the bl ood draws, 
saliva will be collected and measured through VerOFy® cortisol (VCORT)  with the remaining 
salivary sample sent to Quest Diagnostics for free cortisol measurements through LC -MS/MS 
assay.  VCORT is IDE exempt per the requirements outlined in 21CFR812.2(c) and in 
21CFR809.10(c).  The nurse coordinator will complete their assessment and review the patient’s 
recorded daily blood pressure, subject diary, adverse events and any medications taken. At Visit 
13, an Actigraph Link accelerometer will be provided for monitor ing daily activity and sleep patterns  
for one week.  
To note, the use of the VerOFy ® may be restricted based upon the company’s availability to 
provide the device to our site site. As noted under the secondary/exploratory objectives, the 
VerOFy® will not be used to “ make dosing decisions or diagnoses and formal monitoring will be 
accomplished using serum cortisol sampling.” We therefore will collect and record results only at 
time of availability for use of the device. The informed consent wi ll notify participants/families that 
this sampling and measurement will be based upon when the device is available at the time of 
study visit. . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Week 1 4 + 5 days

instructed to change the infusion set and notify the investigators. If occlusion persists, patients will be instructed to resume their usual oral hydrocortisone dose until occlusion is 
resolved.  
• A pump malfunction that results in delivery of the entire reservoir  (worst case scenario  100 
mg of hydrocortisone) is not a life threatening event as children receive similar or greater 
amounts of hydrocortisone during illness. If the entire reservoir is delivered, pa tients will be 
instructed to notify the investigators and return to their usual oral hydrocortisone dosing 
until a replacement pump is given to the family.  
At all times the PI [INVESTIGATOR_503115].  If pump therapy is stopped at any point the

26 9 Risks and Benefits  
9.1 Potential Risks  
Risks of Hydrocortisone 
While there are risks associated with chronic corticosteroid use, this CAH patient population does 
not produce adequate levels of cortisol and therefore require this treatment for survival. Patients 
with CAH, whether in the study or not, take corticosteroids every day of their life. The potential 
risks specific to this study are mainly dermatologic: Allergic dermatitis, cutaneous and 
subcutaneous atrophy, erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], rash, sterile abscess, 
striae, urticaria.  
Potential risks of hydrocortisone in children and adults not specific to our study population and 
study design include:  
• Gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_503116].  
• Allergic reactions: allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, 
anaphylaxis, angioedema.  
• Cardiovascular: Bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, 
circulatory collapse, congestive heart failure, f at embolism, hypertension, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent myocardial 
infarction (see WARNINGS), pulmonary edema, syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, 
thrombophlebitis, vasculitis.  
• Dermatologic: Acne , allergic dermatitis, burning or tingling (especially in the perineal area, 
after intravenous injection), cutaneous and subcutaneous atrophy, dry scaly skin, ecchymoses and petechiae, edema, erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
impaired wound healing, increased sweating, rash, sterile abscess, striae, suppressed 
reactions to skin tests, thin fragile skin, thinning scalp hair, urticaria.  
• Endocrine: Decreased carbohydrate and glucose tolerance, development of cushingoid 
state, glycosuria, hirsutis m, hypertrichosis, increased requirements for insulin or oral 
hypoglycemic agents in diabetes, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, menstrual 
irregularities, secondary adrenocortical and pi[INVESTIGATOR_80567] (particularly in times of stress, a s in trauma, surgery, or illness).  
• Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, fluid retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, potassium loss, sodium retention.  
• Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distention, bowel/bladder dysfunc tion (after intrathecal 
administration), elevation in serum liver enzyme levels (usually reversible upon 
discontinuation), hepatomegaly, increased appetite, nausea, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer with 
possible perforation and hemorrhage, perforation of the small and large intestine 
(particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative esophagitis.  
• Metabolic: Negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism.  
• Musculoskeletal: Aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, Charcot -like arthropathy, 
loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, pathologic fracture of long bones, postinjection flare (following intra- articular use), steroid myopathy, tendon rupture, vertebral

week thereafter while on the pump. As an additional safety measure for monitoring pump failure 
that does not trigger an alarm, families will be given and instructed on how to use an automatic, 
upper arm blood pressure monitor with a cuff appropriate for the child’s size. One week prior to the 
SQHC pump treatment, patients while on oral HC will measure and log child’s blood pressure daily 
in the morning, after [ADDRESS_647948]. When the child is on the pump, families will be instructed to

28 10 Safety and Adverse Events  
10.1  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse 
events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_503145] c linical significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that 
is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of 
major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an 
emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period 
from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, 
the study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_647951] ing condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition will be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.

29 At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event will also be recorded and doc umented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled v isit, 
the investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71979] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets 
the criteria for an adverse event.   
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] 
a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event 
if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_503118].  
10.[ADDRESS_647952] seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all advers e events will be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module 
of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results will be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one 
diagnosis.  
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each 
event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study  
treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end 
of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event 
that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or 
study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
10.3  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
10.3.1  IRB Notification by [CONTACT_16473] (including follow -up information) must be submitted to the IRB 
within 5 working days if it falls under the UPI[INVESTIGATOR_17235].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_173195]’s binder.

10.4  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503119]:  
• An infection at the site of SQ cannulation. On the first and second occasion of an infected site, the cannula will be changed and moved to a new SQ location, and the family will receive additional training in proper hygienic technique. If infection occurs on more than two 
occasions, poor hygienic technique might be a cause and the patient will be removed from 
the study.  
• A systemic allergic reaction at the site of the SQ infusion cannula; if this happens we will discontinue using the pump and return a child to their oral HC therapy.  
• If a patient experiences more than two epi[INVESTIGATOR_503120] (defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms caused by [CONTACT_503147]:   lethargy, hypoglycemia, low 
blood pressure, vomiting/nausea, abdominal pain, weakness, dizziness and cardiovascular 
collapse)  in the SQ treatment period, the patient will be removed from the study. Periods of 
increased stress or illness can result in adrenal crisis and can occur in any CAH patients at any time. The adrenal crisis would be attributed to the pump if there are no other triggers 
such as trauma, febrile illness, gastroenteritis. Patients will be instructed to take stress dose oral steroids during physical stress as per emergency protocol that all children with CAH 
receive as part of standard care, in addition to the cortisol provided by [CONTACT_503148]: September 20, [ADDRESS_647953]. The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_503121]. . The medical 
monitor will summarize its findings and/or recommendations in a letter to the Principal Investigator. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_879] a copy of the monitor’s  report to the Institutional Review 
Board per their policy.  
 
11 Statistical Considerations  
11.1 Primary Outcomes Measure  
Primary objective 1: Time periods of hyper - and hypocortisolemia and over - and under -
suppression of 17OHP and D4A will be compared between the oral and SQHC PKPD  admissions 
using a paired t -test (with times log -transformed if needed to satisfy the normality assumption). A 
sample of 8 children gives 80% power to detect a population- average difference in outcome 
(undesired time period) between oral HC and SQHC pump of 1.[ADDRESS_647954] deviation 
describing variation between children i n the outcome for oral HC minus the outcome for SQHC 
pump (Cohen's d=1.2). This study design and analysis have not been performed to our knowledge 
in humans or animals, and data to estimate this standard deviation do not exist.  
11.2 Secondary Outcomes Measure s 
Statistical analysis for secondary measures of actigraph, quality of life , sleep survey  and NIH toolbox: 
Descriptive statistics for each outcome variable will be provided and used to discern changes in the 
outcome variables. Repeated measures ANOVAs will be used to examine differences in each 
outcome variable from Oral HC to SQHC Pump, and then back to Oral HC.  
Statistical analysis for VCORT: Correspondence between VCORT and salivary cortisol by [CONTACT_29864] -
MS/MS (56 samples total) will be described using a scatter plot identifying the child who provided 
each measurement; the intra- class correlation (ICC) describing association of VCORT with LC -
MS/MS; a test for bias of VCORT relative to LC -MS/MS using a paired t -test; and percentiles of 
absolute differences between the VCORT and LC -MS/MS measurements (e.g., "90% of differences 
were less than X").  
The Likelihood Ratio Test will be used to determine the statistical significance of the changes in 
PKPD  parameters. The difference between objective function values (OFV; a goodness of fit 
measure similar to a sum of squares) is approximately chi -square distributed and if the OFV 
decreases by [CONTACT_726] 3.8 (chi -square, p=0.05, df=1) the model with the added parameter is 
significantly better. No formal power calculations are c urrently available for the NLME modeling 
approach. If a persistent difference within subjects exists among the TVCL estimates across the 3 
PKPD  treatment arms, it will be detected as a significant difference among THETA1, THETA2 and 
THETA3.

Version date: September 20, [ADDRESS_647955] of the Trial  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , the Declaration of Helsinki,  and the appropriate regulatory 
requirement(s).   
The University Of Minnesota IRB will review all appropriate study documentation in order to 
safeguard the rights, safety and well -being of the patients.  The study will only be conducted at 
sites where IRB/EC or Campus Administrator approval has been obtained.  The protocol , informed 
consent, written information given to the patients, annual progress reports, and any revisions to 
these documents will be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_093].   
Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the val idity of the study and the 
integrity of the data collected.  Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, 
maintained for the duration of the study and retained according to the appropriate regulations.   
12.2 Data Management  
Source data is  all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities 
in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are 
contained in source documents. Data generated by [CONTACT_503149] (eCRFs).  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All m issing data must be explained.  If a space on the 
CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  Electronic data capture  will be 
utilized for case report forms. Data will be entered into a secure, password- protected REDCap 
database set up for this study and administered at the University of Minnesota.  
Confidentiality – Data Security  
All data obtained from this study will be linked to a study  specific code and not to personal 
identifying information (e.g., name, social security number, medical record number). Data will be entered into REDCap database which will be password secured, and encrypted and only 
accessible to the investigator and research staff of this project. The REDCap database uses a 
MySQL database via a secure web interface with data checks used during data entry to ensure 
data quality. REDCap includes a complete suite of features to support HIPAA compliance, 
including a full audi t trail, user -based privileges, and integration with the institutional LDAP server. 
The MySQL database and the web server will both be housed on secure servers operated by [CONTACT_146092]’s Information Systems group (AHC -IS). The 
servers are in a physically secure location on campus and are backed up nightly, with the backups stored in accordance with the AHC -IS retention schedule of daily, weekly, and monthly tapes 
retained for 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectivel y. Weekly backup tapes are stored 
offsite. The AHC -IS servers provide a stable, secure, well -maintained, and high -capacity data 
storage environment, and both REDCap and MySQL are widely -used, powerful, reliable, well -
supported systems. Access to the study' s data in REDCap will be restricted to the members of the 
study team by [CONTACT_125698].Only members of the study team will be granted access to 
the REDCap database and will receive protocol and data entry training prior to access being 
granted. Study data will not be shared outside the study team. The consent and study data will not be placed in medical, employment, or educational records.

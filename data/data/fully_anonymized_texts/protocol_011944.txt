1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Protocol title:   
A Phase 2 non -randomized, open -label, multi -cohort, multi -center study assessing the clinical 
benefit of SAR444245 (THOR -707) combined with other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12957]:  A study of SAR444245 combined with other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12958] (Master protocol)  
Rationale:  
SAR444245, with its site -specific pegylation, was designed to s ubstantially reduce association 
with the interleukin (IL) -2 α receptor, while retaining stimulatory activity for cells expressing the 
moderate affinity IL -2 βγ receptor.  
The proposed study aims to establish proof -of-concept that combining the no n-alpha -IL2 
SAR444245 with other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12959] a significant increase in the percentage 
of patients experiencing an objective response in the setting of various advanced gastrointestinal 
cancers.  
This study is developed as a master protocol in order to accelerate the investigation of 
SAR444245 with various anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12960]. This design is  
with the flexibility to open new treatment cohorts as new treatment combinations become 
available and close existing treatment cohorts that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or 
unacceptable toxicity .  
The information that is introductory and common to all cohorts is included in the present 
document (“Master Protocol”), and cohort -specific elements are includ ed in separate substudies.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 15 Special considerations pertaining to methodology  
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) will be used to control recruitment, assignment per site 
and to facilitate the handling, management,  and accountability  of drug supply .  
Number of participants:  
Please refer to the individual substud y for the numbers of participants to be enrolled and treated at 
the recommended safe dose.  
Note : Enrolled participants are all participants from screened participants who have been 
allocated to an intervention regardless of whether the intervention was received or not.   
Intervention  groups and duration : 
The duration of the study for a participant will include:  
Screening Period : up to 28 days  
Treatment P eriod: enrolled participants will receive continuous treatment until PD, unacceptable 
adverse event (AE) or other full permanent discontinuation criteria as described in Section  7; or 
completion of Cycle 35 (if applicable).  
End of Treatment and Follow -up:  End of Treatment Visit will occur 30 days ±[ADDRESS_12361]. 
Participants will then enter the Observation Period  and will be followed differently depending 
on the reason leading to  End of Treatment (EOT) .  
1. Participants who discontinue study treatment without PD or who complete 35 cycles  of 
treatment without PD will be followed every  3 months ±[ADDRESS_12362] IMP 
administration, for safety (as per Schedule of Activities [SoA]) and tumor imaging 
assessments until PD, start of another anticancer therapy, final cohort cut -off, whichever 
comes first, before moving to the Survival Phone Call Follow -Up Period.  
2. Participants  who discontinue study treatment with PD will be followed for safety  in the 
Follow -Up Visit 1 occurring 3 months ±[ADDRESS_12363] IMP administration, before 
moving to the Sur vival Phone Call Follow -Up Period.  
Participants who move into the  Survival Phone Call Follow -Up Period  will be contact[CONTACT_13104] 3 months ±[ADDRESS_12364] .

After the cohort cut -off date for the primary ORR analysis, participants can continue to receive 
IMP, if clinical benefit is observed, until full permanent discontinuation criteria described in 
Section  7 are met and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the study schedule of 
activities.  
For each cohort, the cut -off date for the final analysis (ie, analysis of secondary objectives and  
update of primary objective) will be 18 months from the corresponding cohort LPI. After this cut -
off date  for the final analysis , the participants of the given cohort still receiving study treatment in 
that specific cohort will be followed up as the cohor ts after early termination described in  
Section  10.1.9 . 
Study intervention(s)  
Investigational medicinal products  
SAR444245  
• Formulation : SAR444245 is provided as a 2 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion 
in a single -dose vial with an extractable volume of 1  mL. 
• Route of administration : IV infusion  
• Dose regimen : 24 μg/kg administered as an IV infusion over 30 mi nutes every 3 weeks on 
Day 1 of each cycle (21  days per cycle) for the treatment duration defined in the in dividual 
substudy.  
Study sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible. However, given the variab ility of infusion pumps from site to site, a window 
between -5 minutes and +[ADDRESS_12366] of 
infusion -related  reactions (I RR) or flu -like symptoms, 30 to 60 minutes prior to SAR444245 
infusion (no longer than 60 minutes) for the first 4 cycles:  
• Aceta minophen (paracetamol) 650 to 1000 mg IV or oral route (PO) (or equivalent), and 
then optionally thereafter as needed.  
Diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV  or PO  (or equivalent, eg, cetirizine, promethazine, 
dexchlorpheniramine, according to local approval and a vailability), and then optionally 
thereafter as needed.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 17 SAR444245 premedication may be optional after 4 cycles  
• For a participant who has no I RR during the first 4 cycles: Premedication for the 
subsequent infusions is optional at the Investigator’s discreti on. However, if during the 
subsequent infusions without premedication the participant experiences an I RR (any 
grade), premedication must be restarted for all subsequent infusions.  
• If a participant develops an I RR Grade <[ADDRESS_12367] cycle only and  then 
experiences no further I RRs during their next 3 cycles: The Investigator may consider 
omitting premedication for Cycle 5. If no I RR is observed during Cycle 5 without 
premedication, premedication is optional for the subsequent cycles at the Investiga tor’s 
discretion. However, if during Cycle 5  without premedication the participant experiences 
an IRR (any grade), premedication must be restarted for all subsequent cycles.  
Statistical considerations:  
• Analysis of primary endpoint:  
- Objective response ra te (ORR) and best overall response (BOR) will be summarized 
for the efficacy population with descriptive statistics. In addition, two -sided 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for ORR will be computed using the Clopper -Pearson 
method . 
• Analysis of secondary effi cacy endpoints:  
- The time to response ( TTR ) will be summarized on the subgroup of participants who 
have achieved confirmed objective response in the efficacy population.  
- The duration of response  (DoR ) will only be summarized on the subgroup of 
participants who have achieved confirmed objective response in the efficacy 
population.  
- The clinical benefit rate  (CBR ) will be estimated by [CONTACT_13105].  
- The progression free survival  (PFS) will be summarized on the efficacy population 
using Kaplan -Meier methods. The median PFS times and associated 90% CI will be 
provided.  
• Analysis of secondary safety endpoints:  
- Number and percentage of participants experiencing treatment -emergent adverse 
events ( TEAEs ) by [CONTACT_13106] ( SOC ) and Preferred Term  (PT) will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_13107]  (NCI-CTC AE) V 5.0 or American Society for Transplantation and 
Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT ) grade (all grades and Grade ≥3) for the exposed 
population. Similar summaries will be prepared fo r treatment -related  TEAE s, TEAEs 
leading to permanent partial intervention discontinuation (any of the IMP 
components) , TEAEs leading to permanent full intervention discontinuation, TEAEs 
leading to dose modification, serious TEAEs, TEAEs with fatal outcome, adverse 
events of special interest (AESI s), and AEs/SAEs occurring during the post -treatment 
period. In addition, the number (%) of participants with any Grade 5 AE (TEAE and 
post-treatment) , participants who died by [CONTACT_6960] (treatment -emergent period ,

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 23 a Evaluation: Screening assessments to be performed prior to first IMP administration unless otherwise indicated.  There is no need to perform Cycle [ADDRESS_12379] be  performed, and results should be revi ewed by [CONTACT_13109]. After Cycle 1, samples for laboratory assessments (excluding PK & biomarker) can be collected up to [ADDRESS_12380] IMP administration in which study procedures used to support 
eligibility are done.  
b Cycle: a treat ment cycle is 21 days. See details in Section  6.1 for IMP administration. If treatment cycles are adjusted, all procedures except tumor assessment imaging will be completed ac cording to the cycle 
number. Tumor assessment imaging will be perfo rmed at fixed time points from C1D1 regardless of any treatment delays.  
c Observation Period: Participants who enter the Observation period will be followed differently depending on the reason leadin g to permanent IMP discontinuation. See Section  4.1. For participant's convenience, all 
Follow -up assessments may occur during the same visit as that when tumor assessment is performed.  
d Surviv al Phone Call Follow -Up Period: Once the participant stops the tumor assessments due to PD or starts a new antineoplastic therapy, the participant  moves into the Survival Follow -up Period and should be 
contact[CONTACT_13110] 3 months ±1 4 days to assess for survival status. Updated survival status may be requested by [CONTACT_13111].  
e For Cycle 4 visits, please refer to PK flowchart in Section  1.5. 
f C1D8 and/or C1D15 visits must be performed on site for the following participants only: 1) Participants scheduled to have blo od draws for biomarker assessment and/or ADA on Day 8; 2) Participants who will 
receive IMP on Day 8 and Day 15. For all other part icipants, these 2 on -site visits may be done remotely as appropriate based on investigator’s discretion per institutional standard and local regul ations. If this is 
the case, this must be documented in the source document. Sponsor  may decide to cancel safe ty assessment on C1D8 and C1D15 if  safety data justifies it.  
g Weight/Height: Height is required at baseline only. Weight is required at Screening and prior to starting each infusion.  The total dose will be calculated based on the weight on the day of the infusion or the most 
recent weight assuming it was assessed in a reasonable time frame according to Investigator assessment. Study sites should ma ke every effort to measure body weigh t as close to the infusion day as possible

n Brain imaging: For participants with no previous history of brain metastases, screening brain imaging will need to be obtaine d. MRI is the preferred imaging modality however CT is acceptable if an MRI is cl inically 
contraindicated. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases (ie, no neurological symptoms, no requirements for corticosteroi ds, and no lesion >1.5 cm) may participate but will require regular imaging of the brain 
as a site of disease  as per proto col tumor assessment (TA) schedule . In all other cases, the lesions must be treated. Two additional scans, obtained at least 4 weeks apart, should be obtained to document disease 
stability after local treatment administration to the brain metastases has be en completed. If participants receive therapy during these 4 weeks stabilization at the treating physician's discretion, it w ill be considered 
as part of prior anti -cancer therapy. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provi ded they are stable, which is defined as lack of progression on two sets of imaging obtained at least 
[ADDRESS_12381]  14 days prior to study treatment. The screening brain scan may be collected up to 42 days prior to enrollment.

SAR444245 is a recombinant human IL -2 with a site -specific substitution of a non -native azido 
lysine amino acid residue which is bio -conjugated to a single linear 30 kDa PEG. SAR444245 is 
being developed as an immuno -oncology treatment to be administered e very 2 weeks (Q2W) or 
less frequently (every 3 weeks [Q3W] in the present study) in patients with cancer.
. The site -specific pegylat ion of IL -2 in SAR444245 provides 
a “non-alpha” pharmacologic profile for SAR444245 that is designed to prevent engagement of 
the high affinity IL -2Rα, while maintaining CD8+ T cell anti -tumor activity and resulting in 
an improved safety profile relative t o aldesleukin. Aldesleukin is approved in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) for the following indications: the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC ) and 
metastatic melanoma, with the same or limited a pproval status in other countries. Its use has 
resulted in durable complete response ( CR) in some patients with anti -tumor effects via elevations 
in CD8+  T cells (naïve, effector, and memory T cells). However, widespread use of aldesleukin is 
limited by [CONTACT_13114] s low response rate, short half -life (t 1/2), and severe toxicities including primarily 
vascular leak syndrome (VLS ), and cytokine release syndrome  (CRS).  
In contrast to native IL -[ADDRESS_12383] high potency at the 
IL-2Rα/β/γ receptor expressed on Treg cells because the site -specific pegylation blocks IL -2Rα 
engagement. Due to this re -programmed receptor bias, SAR444245 induces proliferation of 
peripheral CD8+ T and NK cell s in vivo as observed in mice and NHP with negligible effect on 
the expansion of immunosuppressive Treg cells. Furthermore, SAR444245 does not bind IL -2Rα, 
and does not activate cells that express low levels of the high affinity IL -2Rα, such as Type 2 
innate lymphoid cells (ILC -2s), eosinophils, and endothelial cells.  Thus, it is expected to have 
a greatly reduced risk of VLS, and therefore a wider therapeutic window as compared to 
aldesleukin. In preclinical NHP studies, no signs of VLS were observed at a  dose of SAR444245 
that was higher than the dose eliciting maximal expansion of peripheral CD8+ T cells. 
Therefore, in the clinic, SAR444245 is expected to have a wider therapeutic window as compared 
to aldesleukin due to a greatly reduced risk of VLS.  
Furthermore, the site -specific pegylation extends the plasma t 1/2 of IL -2 in SAR444245 in mice 
and NHP to 9 -13 h versus 85 min for aldesleukin in patients.  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and NHP models.  
The proposed study aims to establish proof -of-concept that combining the no n-alpha -IL2 
SAR444245 with other anticance r therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12959] a significant increase in the percentage 
of participants  experiencing an objective response in the setting of various advanced 
gastrointestinal cancers.

[ADDRESS_12384] of the indications’ proposed cohorts. In 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer 
(GC/GEJ),  pembrolizumab  monotherapy has received approvals as the 2L or 3L+ treatment. 
However, the benefit is limited to patients  whose tumor expresses programmed death -ligand 1 
(PD-L1) (CPS ≥1 or ≥10 ) and the objective response was 16% (CPS ≥1) and 22% (CPS ≥10) 
(3, 4). Combining SAR444245 (THOR -707) with  pembrolizumab  is anticipated t o expand to 
population responding to the anti -PD1 and to  increase the quality of the response.  Such effects 
have been demonstrated in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_12964] -02 study for  bempegaldesleukin  combined with nivolumab 
in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In this s tudy, 53% ORR including 34% CR  was 
obtained for melanoma (5), 54% ORR for RCC  (6), 50% ORR for non -small cell lung cancer (6), 
48% ORR for urothelial carc inoma (7) and 13% ORR for triple -negative breast cancer (8), 
respectively.  The ORR was high regardless of PD -L1 status,  eg, 50% (PD -L1+) and 45%  
(PD-L1-) for metastatic urothelial carcinoma (7), 64% (PD -L1+) and 39% (PD -L1-) 
for melanoma (5), and 57% (PD -L1+) and 54 % (PD -L1-) for renal cell carcinoma (6). Based on 
such evidence, we consider also, that combining THOR -707 with pembrolizumab  is anticipated t o 
bring benefit  to patients with ESCC and GC/GEJ even in the context of low PD -L1 and could 
rescue patients who have  progressed or relapsed following an anti -PD1/PD -L1 treatment.  
In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, the ICI -based combination regimen (ate zolizumab + 
bevacizumab) has become the new SoC in 1L based on improved durable response and survival. 
Combining SAR444245 (THOR -707) with ICI will be evaluated to rescue patients who have 
failed the ICI -based 1L regimen.  
Non-MSI-H metastatic colorectal c ancer (CRC) is known to not respond to ICI, being qualified as 
immune excluded or restricted tumors.  Combining ICI with SAR444245 (THOR -707) may 
initiate inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment and sensitize CRC to  anti-PD1.  
More details will be provided on the rationale of each cohort and tumor type in appropriate 
substudies.  
2.3 BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSM ENT  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits an d risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events  (AEs)  of SAR444245 may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
2.3.1  Risk assessment   
Safety data from clinical studies conducted with SA R444245 in humans is currently limited to 
available from the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_12385] -in-human study  (Study TCD16843 [HAMMER] , hereafter 
referred to as HAMMER ). Consequently, the assessment of the risks associated with SAR444245 
is based on existing preclinical data and takes into consideration the known safety profile of the 
structurally similar product aldesleukin (Proleukin®) and current knowledge of the new 
generation, investigational IL -2 analog NKTR -214 (bempegalde sleukin).

the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_12386] -in-human ( HAMMER ) study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Aldesleukin experience   
There is currently one marketed IL -[ADDRESS_12387], Proleukin (aldesleukin). It is an IL -[ADDRESS_12388] atic RCC.  
Aldesleukin is a human recombinant interleukin -2 which has been shown to possess the biological 
activities of human native IL -2 mediated through its binding with the high -affinity IL -2Rαβγ and 
intermediate -affinity IL -2Rβγ receptors. The widespre ad use of aldesleukin has been limited by [CONTACT_13115], a short t 1/2 that requires dosing three times per day, and toxi cities ( 9), whic h 
include life -threatening and sometimes fatal VLS. Vascular leak syndrome is characterized by 
a loss of vascular tone and extravasation of plasma proteins and fluid into the extravascular space. 
It results in hypotension and reduced organ perfusion wh ich, if severe, can result in death. It may 
be associated with cardiac arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular), angina, myocardial 
infarction, respi[INVESTIGATOR_12965], gastrointestinal bleeding or infarction, 
renal insufficien cy, edema, and mental status changes.  
Aldesleukin has been associated with exacerbation of pre -existing or initial presentation of 
auto-immune disease and inflammatory disorders. Exacerbation of Crohn’s disease, scleroderma, 
thyroiditis, inflammatory arthr itis, diabetes mellitus, oculo -bulbar myasthenia gravis, crescentic 
IgA glomerulonephritis, cholecystitis, cerebral vasculitis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome and bullous 
pemphigoid, have been reported following treatment with IL -2. 
It was recognized early in cl inical studies that eosinophilia appeared to mark the onset of VLS, 
with several reports of fast, dose -dependent elevation in eosinophils. Additional publications 
suggested a causal connection between the increase in peripheral IL -5 levels and identified I LC-2 
as the source of this powerful chemoattractant and activator of eosinophils  (10). Aldesleukin 
mediates activation of ILC -2s via interacti on with the high affinity IL -2R⍺ chain that exists at low 
levels on ILC -2s. 
Treatment with aldesleukin is associated with impaired neutrophil function (reduced chemotaxis) 
and the resulting increase in the risk of disseminated infection, including sepsis a nd bacterial 
endocarditis. Consequently, preexisting bacterial infections should be adequately treated prior to 
initiation of Proleukin therapy.  
Proleukin toxicity threat mandates that it should be administered in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12966] o f a qualified physician experienced in the use of anticancer agents. An intensive care 
facility and cardiopulmonary or intensive care specialists must be available.  
Proleukin has been shown to have embryo lethal effects in rats but there are no adequate 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women; this information can be extrapolated to SAR444245. 
Also, since it is not known whether SAR444245 is excreted in human breast milk, nursing 
mothers cannot participate in this study.

clinical effects of narrow therapeutic index drugs that are hepatically metabolized.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Preclinical data   
Among the potential risks, preclinical data for SAR444245 are lacking for infusion -related  
reactions (I RRs), immunogen icity (anti -drug antibodies), hypersensitivity, and immune -mediated 
adverse events. Those are, however, typi[INVESTIGATOR_12967]444245.  
Further, preclinical data for SAR444245 do  not indicate the potential for nephrotoxicity, 
neurotoxicity, or pulmonary toxicity, which are known adverse effects for aldesleukin. However, 
mitigation strategies for nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity  are also proposed in the protocol.  
Preclinical data f or SAR444245 do not indicate higher risk for infections. However, infections are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_12968].  
There are no preclinical data for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS ) associated with the use of 
SAR444245, but it is known to occur when aldesleukin is combined with cisplatinum, vinblastine 
and dacarbazine (refer to Proleukin US label ) (12). The participants at greatest risk of TLS are 
those with high tumor burden prior to treatment, elevated  uric acid level, poor hydration or tumor 
infiltration of the kidney, or receiving intensive cytoreductive therapy.  
Cytokine release syndrome  (CRS)  is a potentially life -threatening toxicity that has been described 
in the setting of immunotherapy with T ce ll engagement. It is characterized by a variety of 
symptoms including high fevers, hypotension, rigors and malaise, and may progress to cytokine 
storm (uncontrolled immune hyperactivation involving myriad cytokines) with more severe and 
potentially life -threatening manifestations. As SAR444245 mediates immune activation, it may 
induce adverse events related to cytokine release (eg, fatigue, fever, chills, muscle pain, rash, 
nausea, symptoms of autoimmune disease). Furthermore, SAR444245 -related increases of  plasma 
monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP -1), IL -2, and IL -1RA were observed in NHP , 
indicating that SAR444245 administration may be associated with CRS.  
No manifestations of VLS have been reported in pre -clinical toxicity studies with SAR444245. 
Although there is a theoretical risk of VLS occurring in an immunotherapy setting, it has not been 
observed for IL -2 variants with ‘no n-alpha’ profiles. Being a ‘no n alpha’ IL -2, SAR444245 is not 
anticipated to cause VLS.  
No data pertaining to pregnancy and l actation exposure and outcomes are available for 
SAR444245. Due to the missing information for this important risk, detailed mitigation measures 
will be introduced. Conditions for eligibility of women of reproductive potential and male 
subjects with female  partners of childbearing potential are detailed in Section  5.1. Also, since it is 
not known whether SAR444245 is excr eted in human breast milk, nursing mothers cannot 
participate in this study.

A Phase 1/[ADDRESS_12389] -in-human study (HAMMER) is currently ongoing in adult patients with 
advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This is an open -label, multicenter, dose escalation and 
expansion study of SAR444245 IV as a single agent and in combination with the checkpoint 
inhibitor pembrolizumab.  
Available safety information from this study  has informed the selection of the dose (see details in 
Section  4.3).

[IP_ADDRESS]  NKTR -214 (bempegaldesleukin) clinical data   
Useful insight can also be obtained from NKTR -214 (bempegaldesleukin), another new 
generation IL-2 derivative, with activity biased towards the IL -2R receptor.  
In the first -in-human Phase 1 study, NKTR -214 was administered as an outpatient regimen and 
was well tolerated. Twenty -eight patients with advanced or locally advanced solid tumor 
maligna ncies were enrolled in the study. Grade 3 treatment -related adverse events ( TRAE s) were 
reported by 21.4% of patients; there were no Grade [ADDRESS_12390] c ommon TRAEs included fatigue (71%), flu -like symptoms (68%), pruritus (64%), 
hypotension (57%), rash (50%), decreased appetite (46%), arthralgia and cough (each 32%). The 
majority of these events coincided with the peak plasma concentrations of the active cytokine and 
resolved spontaneously or were mitigated by [CONTACT_13116][INVESTIGATOR_12969]. There was 
one reported immune -related adverse event (irAE ) of hypothyroidism associated wi th NKTR -214, 
which was treated with replacement therapy. All Grade 3 hypotension events (18%) were rapi[INVESTIGATOR_12970]. 
NKTR -214-related hypotension was predictable, manageable, and re versible and the incidence of 
Grade 3 hypotension was reduced once hypotension risk mitigation strategies were implemented. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD ) was determined to be 0.009 mg/kg Q3W. Thi s new 
generation, IL -2R-biased IL2 could be safely administered as outpatient basis, and there was 
no report of capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737] (CLS) or VLS  (13).  
In PI[INVESTIGATOR_12964] -02, a single -arm, Phase 1/2 study, NKTR -214 plus nivolumab was administered to 
38 patients with selected immunotherapy -naïve advanced solid tumors (melanoma, RCC, and 
non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]). Several treatment regimens were explored. The dose of 
0.009 mg/kg had excessive toxicity (2 of 3 patients with DLT: Gr ade 3 hypotension [n=1] & 
Grade 4 hyperglycemia + metabolic acidosis [n=1]) when combined with 360 mg of nivolumab. 
All 38  patients had TEAEs that were considered re lated to the study combination. The MTD of 
the combination was defined as NKTR -214 0.006 mg/kg + nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and this dose 
was selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The most common TRAEs (≥30%) at the 
RP2D were flu -like symptoms (80%), rash (80%), fatigue (76%), pruritis (48%), arthralgia (44%), 
headache and diarrhea (40%), nausea (40%), decreased appetite (36%) and peripheral edema 
(36%), myalgia (32%), and nasal congestion (32%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 16% of patients 
at the RP2D ( hyperglycemia, lipase increase, rash, cerebrovascular accident, hyponatremia, 
infectious pleural effusion, syncope). Immune -mediated AEs were observed in 31.6% overall:

observed primarily in Cycles 1 & 2 and became significantly reduced thereafter. There were 
no treatment -related deaths and generally, Grade ≥[ADDRESS_12391] 
guidelines. Tumor responses were observed regardless of baseline PD -L1 status and baseline 
levels of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting therapeutic potential for patients with poor 
prognostic risk factors for response to PD -1/PD -L1 blockade. These data demonstrated that 
NKTR -214 can be safely combined with a checkpoin t inhibitor as dual immunotherapy for the 
treatment of a range of advanced solid tumors  (14).  
2.3.[ADDRESS_12392] -generation IL -2 
(aldesleukin) was the first immunotherapy effective for human cancer. Aldesleukin is approved in 
metastatic RCC and metastatic melanoma and its use has resulted in durable, complete responses 
in some patients with anti -tumor effects via elev ations in CD8+ T cells (naïve, effector, and 
memory T cells). However, clinical benefit of aldesleukin requires high dose as the enhancement 
of the CD8+ T -cell population is mediated through the intermediate -affinity by [CONTACT_8668] -2Rβγ, the 
suppressor CD4+ Treg ce lls are preferentially enhanced at lower dose through the high -affinity 
IL-2Rαβγ which is probably responsible for the limited proportion of responding patients (ORR

SAR444245, as a “no n-alpha” new generation IL -2, is expected to result in greater anti -tumor 
activity than aldesleukin that has already demonstrated clinical benefit.  
2.3.3  Overall benefit: risk conclusion   
SAR444245, with its site -specific pegylation, was designed to substantially reduce association 
with the IL -2 α receptor, while retaining stimulatory activity for cells expressin g the moderate 
affinity IL -2 βγ receptor. These design features are anticipated to minimize safety liability 
associated with Proleukin® by [CONTACT_13117] (regulatory T cells) and off -target complications suc h as VLS , while still promoting 
the expansion of immune populations that can support anti -tumor immune responses.  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants in this study, the potential 
risks identified in association with this  new generation IL -2 SAR444245 combined with other 
anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_12971] .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks in the context of COVID -19  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Risks related to the patient population   
Cancer patients with weakened immune systems are vulnerable to COVID -19 due to the cancer 
itself and treatments. A large case -control study reported patients with cancer had a higher risk for 
COVID -19 inf ection with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.5 compared to those without cancer and those 
with recent (in the past year) diagnosis of cancer were at a significant increased risk with an OR 
of 7.1 (15). Among patients with recent diagnosis of cancer, the adjusted OR for COVID -19 
infection was 6.5 for liver cancer and 6.4 for colorectal cancer, respectively. COVID -19 increases 
the severity and complications in patients with cancer. Patients with cancer a nd COVID -19 had 
significantly worse outcomes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 47.46%; death, 14.93%) than patients with 
COVID -19 without cancer (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 24.26%; death, 5.26%) and patients with cancer 
without COVID -19 (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 12.39%; death, 4.03%) (15). This was agreed by [CONTACT_13118] -19 patients with cancer was reported from 2.54 to 
3.16 compared to those wit hout cancer (16, 17, 18).  
The impact of COVID -[ADDRESS_12393] common cancer 
types reported with an estimated rate of 15.2% and its all -cause in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12972] 
(approximately 20%) ranked the third following hematological malignancies and lung cancer (16). 
In one of these studies, esophageal cancer had a high risk of death (17%), high ICU administration 
rate (33%) and high risks of severe /critical  symptoms (50%), whereas approximately 8 %, 23% 
and 31% were reported respectively for gastrointestinal cancer (19). COVID -19 has caused  delays 
in cancer diagnosis and treatment especially for gastrointestinal cancers, which potentially result 
in poor clinical outcomes (20, 21, 22). Furthermore, patien ts with advanced and metastatic 
gastrointestinal cancer often suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and chronic bleeding, thus 
experiencing malnutrition, poor immune status and anemia (22). In addition, patients may suffer 
from poor mental status such as anxiety or depression during the pandemic. All of these can lead 
to further deterioration of patients’ condition and expose them to high risk of getting COVID -19 
and developi[INVESTIGATOR_12973]. To that end, trial participation will proceed during 
the COVID -19 pandemic, however, measures will be taken to mitigate the potential risks of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection to trial participants.  
Testing for SARS -CoV -2 infection during the screening phase should be at Investigator’s 
discretion and should also follow local/international guidelines (eg, patients who are 
asymptomatic but with high risk of infection, patients with symptoms that could be a ssociated 
with SARS -CoV -2 infection). Patients known to have had SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_12394] be fully clinically recovered in order to be eligible for participation in the study.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 35 During the study, if a participant is diagnosed with SARS -CoV -2 infection , dose modification of 
study intervention should be based on the recommendations provided in Section  6.5. In addition, 
all Investigators are instructed to consult official COVID -19 clinical research guidance from their 
local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution along with other relevant resources, such as : 
• Ameri can Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (23) 
• European Society for Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) (24) 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Risks related to study treatment   
SAR444245 has the potential to induce CRS which could exacerbate the manifestations of 
COVID -19 infection. It is, however, worth noting that pegylated IL -2 bempegaldesleukin is 
currently being evaluated for the treatment of patients with mild COVID -19 in a Phase 1b study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Risks related to study -related activit y  
It is important to minimize the risk of exposure of patients to COVID -19. In addition to the 
contingency measures described in Section  10.9, the following prevention and mitigation plans 
could be implemented at clinical sites:  
• All participating sites should have implemented measures according to regional/local 
Health Authorities, European Medicines Agency (EMA), ESMO, ASCO guidelines 
including but not limited to restrictions of access to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12974], physical 
distancing and personal protective equipment.  
• Study participants should be treated in a dedicated area that is separated from patients with 
COVID -19 infection.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Conclusion on the benefit -risk pertaining to COVID -19  
Overall, benefit -risk is deem ed acceptable in patients with advanced and metastatic 
gastrointestinal cancer during the COVID -19 pandemic. The Sponsor will continue to evaluate 
benefit -risk during the study period.

[ADDRESS_12406] of anti -drug antibody (ADA) on SAR444245 
PK could be identified. Also, in the combinatio n cohort, there was no apparent impact of 
pembrolizumab on the PK of SAR444245.  
Differently from native IL -[ADDRESS_12407] high potency at the 
IL-2Rα/β/γ receptor subunit expressed on T regulatory (Treg) cells because the site -specific 
pegylation blocks IL -2Rα engagement and demonstrates high potency at the IL2Rβ/γ receptor 
subunit expressed on CD8+ T and natural killer cells (NK). Due to this re -programmed receptor 
bias, SAR444245 induces proliferation of peripheral CD8+ T and NK  cells and less impact on 
immunosuppressive Treg cells. Therefore, we closely monitored the PD y change of CD8+ T, NK 
and Treg cells in HAMMER study as supportive information for R2PD selection.  
In the SAR444245 monotherapy dose levels (8 µg/kg, 16 µg/kg , 24 µg/kg , and 32 µg/kg  Q3W), 
the PD y data suggest that a trend for dose -dependent expansion of CD8+ T cells and NK cells has 
been achieved. In the 8 µg/kg dose levels, the average increase in peripheral blood CD8+ T cells 
over baseline at [ADDRESS_12408] dose  was 1.75 -fold. For dose levels 16 µg/kg and 24 µg/kg, the 
peripheral blood CD8+ T cell expansion was 2.[ADDRESS_12409] 3 participants in the 8 µg/kg 
cohort wer e dosed.  
In addition, the average increase in peripheral blood NK cells was 4.22 -fold at 72 hours for 
8 µg/kg. The 16 µg/kg and 24 µg/kg dose levels resulted in 5.[ADDRESS_12410] 
collected available PD y data for the 8 µg/kg (n=4) and 16 µg/kg cohort (n=6), in which the 
average increase in CD8+ T cells, compared to baseli ne, is 2.06 -fold and 3.71 -fold, respectively; 
and the average increase in NK cells, compared to baseline, is 6.73 -fold and 13.43 -fold, 
respectively at the peak expansion day 8. In addition, the comparison of T and NK cell expansion 
between  µg/kg and  µg/kg cohorts indicated that the anticipated maximum CD8+ T and NK 
cells expansion PD y effect may have been achieved at  µg/kg cohort. Based on these data, 
additional quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) and pop ulation PK/PD y models were 
developed and indicated that the increase of CD8+ T and NK cells was less than proportional with 
increasing dose, suggesting a flattening of the dose -response curve.  
In addition, preclinical studies using human whole blood to assess the induct ion of cytokines 
showed no change in cytokine profiles when administering SAR444245 with and without 
pembrolizumab. This study used SAR444245 concentration ranges that went significantly higher 
than current clinical dosages (0.2 -4.5 µg/mL) and showed that SAR444245 -induced cytokine 
release in human whole blood was not affected in the presence of pembrolizumab at Q3W 
schedule.

5.3.1  Meals and dietary restrictions   
No food or drink restrictions are required. Guidelines on fluid inta ke are presented in 
Section  6.1.3 . 
5.3.2  Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco   
No restrictions are required.  
5.3.3  Activity   
Participants are advised to abstain from strenuous exercise and avoid long hot showers and saunas 
on Days 1 to 4 of every treatment cycle.  
5.3.4  Hydration   
Since SAR444245 may induce epi[INVESTIGATOR_12981], participants should be informed of the 
importance of being well hydrated and be provided with hydration instructions. Guidelines 
pertaining to fluid intake on the day of SAR444245 dosing and for the 3 days after administration 
are detailed in Section  6.1.3 . 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES   
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently enrolled.  A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory 
autho rities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure reasons, eligibility criteria, 
and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) and for 
whom resolution of the scr een failure reason may not be expected within a reasonable time frame, 
will be recorded as screen failures. In case the participant is a temporary screen failure 
(ie, prolonged screening), there is no need to have participant re -consent (ie, new ICF signed) if 
the participant finally participates in the trial. However, if the reason for temporary screen failure 
is a reason that might have altered the initial given agreement of the participan t to participate, the 
Investigator should ensure the willingness of the participant to continue or redo some screening 
procedures and his/her participation to the trial. This oral agreement should be documented in the 
participant’s chart. All the tests out  of protocol window should be repeated and entered to the 
additional pages.

All participants will receive the following premedication to prevent or reduce the acute effect of 
IRR or flu -like symptoms, 30 to 60 minutes prior to SAR444245 infusion (no longer than 
60 minutes) for the first 4 cycles:  
• Acetaminophe n (paracetamol) 650 to 1000 mg (IV or PO)  (or equivalent), and then 
optionally thereafter as needed.  
• Diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV  or PO  (or equivalent , eg, cetirizine, promethazine, 
dexchlorpheniramine, according to local approval and availability), and then optionally 
thereafter as needed.  
SAR444245 premedication may be optional after 4 cycles:  
• For a participant who has no I RR for the first 4 cycles, premedication for the subsequent 
infusions is optional at the Investigator’s discretion. However, if duri ng the subsequent 
infusions without premedication the participant experiences an I RR (any grade), 
premedication must be restarted for all subsequent infusions.  
• If a participant develops an I RR Grade <[ADDRESS_12427] cycle only and then 
experiences no  further I RRs during their next 3 cycles the Investigator may consider 
omitting premedication for Cycle 5 . If no I RR is observed during Cycle 5  without 
premedication, premedication is optional for the subsequent cycles at the Investigator’s 
discretion. How ever, if during Cycle 5  without premedication the participant experiences 
an IRR (any grade), premedication must be restarted for all subsequent cycles.

7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION    
7.1.1  Permanent  discontinuation   
Study intervention should be permanently discontinued in an y of the following cases:  
•At the participant’s  request, at any time and irrespective of the reason (consent’s
withdrawal), or at the request of their legally authorized represent ative  (if allowed by [CONTACT_13133]) . “Legally authorized representative” is considered to be a n individual or
judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of
a prospective participant  to the patient’s  participation in the procedure(s) involved in the
research.
•If, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], c ontinuation of the study treatment would be detrimental
to the participant’s  wellbeing, such as:
-Unacceptable AE.
-Documented disease progression.
-Poor compliance to the study protocol.
-Completion of 35 cycles when applicable .
-Other, such as concurrent ill ness, that prevents further administration of study
intervention, or that in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], in the best interest of the participant.
•In case of pregnancy occurrence.
If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will remai n in the study to be 
evaluated for serial tumor assessment if permanent discontinuation is not due to PD, for safety 
assessment as per SoA ( Section  1.3) and until resolution or stabilization of AE, and any other 
assessment as per SoA.  Data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention 
and follow -up and for a ny further evaluations that need to be com pleted are reported in the SoA.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unacceptable adverse events  leading to permanent intervention discontinuation  
Discontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver function should be considered by [CONTACT_13134] a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the dose modification and 
toxicity management guidelines (see individual substud y protocol s), or if the Investig ator believes 
that it is in best interest of the participant.  
If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline 
in QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula [QTcF ]) after en rollment, the Investigator or 
qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in 
participant management is needed. This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must 
be documented. Any new clinica lly relevant finding should be reported as an AE.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 59 Any potentially clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be 
immediately rechecked for confirmation and repeated after 24 hours to document evolution before 
making a decision of  permanent intervention discontinuation for the concerned participant.  
Decision criteria for discontinuation following immune -mediated AEs are described in  Section 6.5  
of individual substudies (Guidelines for the management of I RR, CRS, ICANS, VLS ). 
If participants  are clinically stable, and possibly deriving clinical benefit from therapy with 
minimal toxicity, they will be maintained on treatment.   
See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and follow -up and 
for any  further evaluations that need to be completed.  
Handling of participants after permanent intervention discontinuation  
Participants will be followed -up according to the study procedures specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completio n, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed -up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last.  
If possible, and after the permanent intervention discontinuation, the participants will be assessed 
using the procedure normally planned  for the last dosing day with the IMP including 
a pharmacokinetics sample, if appropriate.  Tumor assessment should be repeated if not done at the 
last cycle.  
All cases of permanent intervention discontinuation must be recorded by [CONTACT_13135] e -CRF when considered as confirmed.

screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count)  and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the time frame defined in the SoA.  
• During the screening period, demography, medical/surgical, and disease history will be 
evaluated. Demography includes age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Medical/surgical history 
includes relevant history of previous pathologies and smoking status. Disease history 
includes stage at diagnosis and at study entry, and previous anti -tumor thera py (type, 
duration, reason for discontinuation and response to the therapy). In addition, results of 
driver gene mutation are also to be collected.  
• A comprehensive medical history will be assessed for any cardiovascular signs or 
symptoms prior to treatment , along with a baseline ECG, echocardiography  and troponin 
level.  
• Regular blood samples will be collected from each participant throughout the duration of

Central Review in the future.  
Assessment of tumor response will be conducted using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tum ors (RECIST) 1.1 (see Section  10.8) according to the nature of the measurable lesions, as 
described below.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_12436] appropriate modality according 
to the nature of the measurable lesion(s)   
For participants  with disease that is measured radiologically accor ding to RECIST 1.1 criteria 
(see Section  10.8), a CT or MRI for tumor assessment will be performed as detailed in 
Section  1.3. The choice of whether the imaging is by [CONTACT_4654] (preferred) or MRI is an Investigator 
decision. Once the choice of CT scan or MRI has been made, the same imaging technique should 
be used in a participant throughout the trial.  
Baseline imaging should include all known target lesions. Baseline scans must evaluate extent of 
disease, including imaging of chest, abdomen,  and pelvis and any other locations with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_12987]. This may be accomplished with CT chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis with contrast, or CT chest with contrast and MRI abdomen/pelvis with gadolinium.  
The initial CT/MRI tumor im aging will be performed within 28 days prior to C1D1. Scans 
performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the screening scan if 
they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to the date of enrollment. On 
study imaging will be performed every 9 weeks (63 ±7 days) after the date of first IMP and if 
clinically indicated. Imaging studies should follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for 
delays in cycle starts or extension. After Week 45 tumor imaging sho uld be performed every 
12 weeks (84 ±7 days). Per the primary tumor assessment criteria, after the first documentation of 
response or the first documentation of progression (if the participant is clinically stable), 
confirmatory imaging may be performed no  fewer than 28 days later. Alternately, the scan 
performed at the next scheduled time point (eg, every 63 ±7 days) may be used as confirmation. 
Tumor assessment is not needed for participants who start another anticancer therapy.  
For participants with no p revious history of brain metastases, screening brain imaging will need to 
be obtained. MRI is the preferred imaging modality however CT is acceptable if an MRI is 
clinically contraindicated. If lesions are identified, the lesions must be treated, regardles s of 
symptoms. Two additional scans, obtained at least 4 weeks apart, should be obtained to document 
disease stability AFTER local treatment administration to the brain metastases has been 
completed. If participants receive therapy during these 4 weeks sta bilization at the treating 
physician's discretion, it will be considered as prior anticancer therapy. Participants with 
previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable, which is defined as 
lack of progression on two sets of ima ging obtained at least [ADDRESS_12437] 14 days prior to study treatment. The screening brain scan may be collected up to 42 days 
prior to enrollment.

be measured and recorded.  
• A directed physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, 
lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen).  
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous s erious 
illnesses. Investigators should also pay attention to clinical signs suggestive of VLS, such 
as peripheral edema, pericardial effusion , and pleural effusion, as well as clinical signs 
suggestive of immune -related adverse events, such as pneumonitis,  colitis, 
endocrinopathies, to name a few. Complementary assessments should be performed to 
establish the diagnosis when clinically indicated. Early signs of cytokine release syndrome 
should also prompt a thorough clinical assessment to identify the involv ement of a specific 
organ system, including neurological system.  
8.2.2  Vital signs

[ADDRESS_12450] a hypothesis, 90% CIs will be provided for primary 
and secondary efficacy  endpoints for descriptive purposes only.  
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the efficacy population and analyzed by [CONTACT_13152] (if ap plicable ). Objective response rate, as well as all other efficacy variables will 
be derived using the local radiologist’s/Investigator’s assessment for all cohorts.  Unless otherwise 
specified, the assessments are based on RECIST 1.1.  
All safety analyses wi ll be performed on the exposed population by [CONTACT_13153] (if 
applicable). A baseline value will be defined as the latest value or measurement taken up to the 
first administration of the IMP.  
The analysis period will be divided into 3 segments:  
• The pre-treatment period is defined as the time from when the participants give informed 
consent to the first administration of the IMP.  
• The on-treatment period (ie, treatment -emergent period)  is defined as the time from the 
first administration of IMP up to [ADDRESS_12451] administration of IMP . 
• The post -treatment period is defined as the time from the [ADDRESS_12452] 
administration of IMP.  
9.4.2  Primary endpoint(s)   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Objective response rate   
For all cohorts,  the ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or 
PR as per Investigator’s asse ssment.  
The BOR  is the best overall response observed from the date of first IMP until disease 
progression, death, cut -off date or initiation of post -treatment anti -cancer therapy, whichever 
occurs first.  
ORR and BOR will be summarized with descriptive statistics. In addition, two -sided 90% CIs will 
be computed using the Clopper -Pearson method.  All objective responses need to be confirmed by 
a subsequent assessment performed at least 4 weeks apart from the initial response obs ervation.  
9.4.3  Secondary endpoint(s)   
The secondary endpoints include safety, efficacy (TTR, DoR, CBR, PFS per RECIST 1.1), 
immunogenicity, and PK.

Time to response will be assessed on the subgroup of participants who have achieved confirmed 
objective response  in the efficacy population . 
Time to response will be defined as the time from the date of first IMP administration to the 
first tumor assessment at which the overall response was recorded as PR or CR that is 
subsequently confirmed . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration of response   
The DoR  will only be summarized on the subgroup of participants who have achieved confirmed 
objective response  in the efficacy population .  
The duration of response will be defined as the time from the date of first tumor assessment at 
which the overall response was recorded as  CR or PR that is subsequently confirmed to the date 
of first documentation of objective progressive disease before the initiation of any post -treatment 
anti-cancer therapy or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  In the absence of  disease 
progression or death before cut -off date, DOR will be censored at the date of the last valid tumor 
assessment performed before the cut -off date or date of initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, 
whichever is earlier.  
Duration of response will be su mmarized with descriptive statistics usin g Kaplan -Meier methods. 
The median DoR and associated 90% CI will be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical benefit rate   
The CBR will be defined as the proportion of participants with clinical benefit (confirmed CR or 
PR as BOR, or SD lasting at least 6 months ). Specifically, participants will be considered as 
clinical benefit responders if they achieve a  CR or PR as BOR, or have an overall response 
recor ded as SD at 6 months (ie, 26 weeks ) or later from first  IMP intake, allowing for the ±7 days 
visit window for tumor assessment scheduled at 27  weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progression -free survival (RECIST 1.1)   
Progression -free survival is defined as the time from the date of first IMP to the date of the 
first documentation of objective progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first. 
The analysis of PFS will be based on the foll owing censoring rules:  
• If progression or death is not observed before the cut -off date  and prior to the initiation of 
a further anticancer therapy, then PFS will be censored at the date of the last valid tumor 
assessment performed before the cut -off date o r date of initiation of a further anticancer 
therapy, whichever is earlier.  
• A participant without event (death or disease progression) and without any valid 
post‑baseline tumor assessment will be censored at the day of first IMP (Day 1).

The Investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasona ble cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for study or cohort termination by [CONTACT_1034], as well as reasons for the early closure of 
a study site by [CONTACT_13178]: 
• For study termination:  
- Information on the product leads to doubt as to the benefit/risk ratio  
- Discontinuation of further study intervention development  
• For cohort termination  
- Early evidence of lack of benefit  
• For site termination:  
- Failure of the Inves tigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines

10.3.1  Definition of AE   
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related 
to the study intervention.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 91 Events meeting  the AE definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigato r (ie, not related to progression of underlying 
disease), eg:  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either 
an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical s equelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action ” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, “lack of 
efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action ” also constitutes an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT meeting the AE definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_13184]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, app endectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or conditi on(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 92 10.3.2  Definition of SAE   
An SAE is defined as any adverse event that, at any dose:  
A) Results in death  
B) Is life -threa tening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe . 
C) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12994] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If 
a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
D) Results in p ersistent or significant disability/incapacity  
- The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
- This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
E) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
F) Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by [CONTACT_13185]. These 
events should usually be considered serious.  
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as 
a guideline for determining which cond ition has to be considered as a medically 
important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive:  
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:  
- Allergic bronchospasm    
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow 
aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc)

10.3.3  Recording and follow -up of AE and/or SAE   
AE and SAE recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all  
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information  in the e-CRF . 
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to the Sponsor’s representative in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE e -CRF page . 
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_12996]’s representative. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of 
the participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_12997]’s representative.  
• The Investi gator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of intensity  
The Investi gator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories, as per NCI CTCAE V5.0 definitions  (except 
for ICANS and CRS that will be graded using ASTCT criteria integrated with ce ntral laboratory 
cytokine results) : 
• Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living (ADL )*. 
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 94 • Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, a nd not bedridden.  
Assessment of causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than that a relationship cannot be ruled 
out. 
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk  
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor’s representative. However, it is 
very important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to  the Sponsor’s 
repres entative . 
• The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory re porting 
requirements.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 95 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_1034]’s 
representative to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as 
possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, if available the Investigator will provide the Sponsor’s representative  with a copy 
of any post -mortem findings including histopathology.  
• New or updated inform ation will be recorded in the ori ginally submitted documents.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
10.3.4  Reporting of SAEs   
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via an electronic data collection tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor’s representative will be the 
electronic data collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site  will use the paper SAE data collection 
tool (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic d ata collection tool will be taken 
off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data colle ction tool has been taken 
off-line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or 
to the Sponsor’s representative by [CONTACT_756].  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator study file.  
SAE reporting to t he Sponsor via paper data collection tool  
• Facsimile transmission  of the SAE paper data collection tool is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to the Sponsor’s representative.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, no tification by [CONTACT_13186] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_13187].  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE data collection tool  within the designated reporting time frames . 
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator study file.

10.4.1  Definitions   
A woman is considered WOCBP (fertile) from the time of menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal (see below) unless permanently sterile (see below). A postmenopausal sta te is 
defined as the period of time after a woman has experienced no menses for 12 consecutive months 
without an alternative medical cause.  
• A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used 
to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or 
hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation 
of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
Permanent sterilization methods include:  
• Documented hysterectomy.  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656].  
• Document ed bilateral oophorectomy.  
• For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), investigator 
discretion should be applied to determining stu dy entry eligibility.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview . 
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual  cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first administration  of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.

Male participants with partners who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes  pregnant while the male participant is in this study. This 
applies only to male participants who receive study intervention.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record preg nancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and c hild will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or in dication for the procedure.  • Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or due to a medical cause)

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 101 Selection of Lesions  
 Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (lon gest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) 
by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by [CONTACT_461]. All 
tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, 
a lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT 
scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At baseline and 
in follow -up, only the short axis wil l be measured and followed.  
 Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm 
[≥1 to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non -measurable. Note: Cystic lesions that  meet the criteria for 
radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be c onsidered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to  a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 
5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the lo ngest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement  in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baselin e sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are no t required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 102 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being  followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as 
assessed using calipe rs (eg, skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Chest X -ray. Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly def ined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
 Conventional CT and MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less. If CT scans 
have slice thickne ss greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situation.  
 PET -CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not alwa ys of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of 
a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may 
bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 Ultrasound . Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later da te and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_462] i s advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy . The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be u seful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess  response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 103  Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and comple te responses (CR) in rare cases (eg, residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).The 
cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment wh en the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease 
is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side 
effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG -PET . While FDG -PET response assessment s need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified accor ding to the following algorithm:  
a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b) No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new  site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on 
CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is 
not PD.  
c) FDG -PET may be used to upgra de a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described 
in the protocol and supported b y disease -specific medical literature for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note: A “positive” FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (<1 cm).  
 Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD) : At l east a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate a n absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). (Note: the appearance of one 
or more new lesions is also considered progressions).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 104  Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as refer ence the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm [<1 cm] 
short  axis). Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker l evel above the normal limits.  
 Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status. It must be representative o f overall disease status change, not 
a single lesion increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be 
confir med at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of Overall Response Criteria  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference f or progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Revised Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumor s (RECIST) Version 1.1 are summarized in the table:

EMERGENCY THAT IS DE CLARED BY A GOVERNME NTAL AGENCY   
A regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency (eg, public health 
emergency, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorist attack) may prevent access to the clinical trial 
site. 
Contingency procedur es are suggested below for an emergency that prevents access to the study 
site, to ensure the safety of the participants, to consider continuity of the clinical study conduct, 
protect trial integrity, and assist in maintaining compliance with Good Clinical  Practice in 
Conduct of Clinical Trials Guidance. Sponsor agreement MUST be obtained prior to the 
implementation of these procedures for the duration of the emergency.  
During the emergency, if the site will be unable to adequately follow protocol -mandated 
procedures, screening and enrollment of participants and administration of study intervention may 
be temporarily delayed (see also Section  7.1.2 ). 
10.9.1  Informed consent   
The participant or their legally authorized representat ive (if allowed by [CONTACT_427])  should 
be verbally informed prior to initiating any changes that are to be implemented for the duration of 
the emergency (eg , study visit delays/treatment extension, use of local labs).  
10.9.2  Study procedures   
Attempts should be made to perform all assessments in accordance with the approved protocol to 
the extent possible.  If onsite visits are possible and there is a need to reduce the time spent on site 
to a minimum, the focus should be  on IMP infusion/administration, collection of safety 
information (vital signs, adverse events) and safety blood collection (mainly biochemistry, 
hematology and ADA, if planned for the visit). However, all efforts should be made to perform 
the measurements  of key parameters for efficacy endpoints, namely CT/MRI scan and tumor 
tissue collection for this study.  
If onsite visits are not possible due to a temporary disruption caused by [CONTACT_13193], focus 
should be given to assessments necessary to ensure the s afety of participants and those important 
to preserving the main scientific value of the study.   
• Remote visits (eg, with home nurses, home health vendor, etc.) may be planned for the 
collection of possible safety and/or efficacy data.  
• Visit windows may be extended for assessment of safety and/or efficacy data that cannot 
be obtained remotely.   
• Use of local clinic or laboratory locations may be allowed.  
10.9.[ADDRESS_12467] will be summarized (eg, study discontinuation or discontinuation/delay/omission of the 
intervention due to the emergency). Any additional ana lyses and methods required to evaluate the 
impact on efficacy (eg, missing data due to the emergency) and safety will be detailed in the SAP.

been reported in the HAMMER study 
within a monotherapy cohort.  
Investigator’s assessment is that it is 
related to the CRS occurring in the 
same patient. Sponsor's assessment 
was that the kidney injury was related 
to increased fluid losses from 
persistent fever.  Participants must have appropriate eG FR 
to be included.  
Monitor renal function parameters 
(BUN/urea & creatinine) regularly from 
screening and throughout the study.  
Dose modification and treatment guidelines 
for nephrotoxicity are provided under 
immune -related reactions in  individual 
substudi es.  
Neurological AEs, including  ICANS  SAR444245  
Not observed in non -clinical toxicology 
studies.  
A minority of patients in the HAMMER 
study have reported such AE as 
detailed in the IB.  
One SAE of CRS (Grade 4 with 
24 ug/kg monotherapy) associated 
with ne urological manifestations 
[hypertension, chills/rigors, flushing, 
fever (maximum temperature: 
102.8°F), as well as neurological 
symptomatology (loss of ability to 
follow commands, confusion, aphasia, 
and involuntary fist clinching)] was 
reported in the HAMMER study . The 
event resolved completely within 30 to 
60 mins after treatment with Exclusion of participants with  active brain 
metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. 
See E 03 for details . 
Guidelines for the management of ICANS 
are provided in  individual substudies .

Cardiovascular effects, including QT 
interval prolongation  SAR444245  
In 28-day repeat -dose study of IV 
SAR444245 in non -human primates, 
there were no SAR444245 -related 
changes to the PR or QRS intervals or 
the heart rate (HR) corrected QTca 
interval. There was a SAR444245 -
related, dose dependent, non adverse 
higher HR at doses  of 
 mg/kg/dose beginning on Day 1 
compared to the control dose group 
and persisting through each 
respective dose following applicable 
telemetry recording sessions, with 
recovery. There was also an expected 
physiologic inverse relationship in the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (RR) intervals as well 
as the raw QT intervals, which 
correlated to the changes in HR, and 
were also considered to be non -
adverse. There were increases in 
individual females of troponin I 
minimal post first dose. There were 
marked decreases in  females and 
males.  
These changes correlated with 
findings of mononuclear cell infiltrates 
and/or myocardial degeneration. All 
changes however, recovered by [CONTACT_13195] a 28 day or 42/[ADDRESS_12472] reported such AE as 
detailed in SAR444245 IB .  Routine mitigation:  
Selection of qualified investigative centers 
with availability of intensive critical 
care/equipment.  
Exclusion of patients with severe or 
unstable cardiac condition within 6 months 
prior to starting study treatment, see E 09 
for details.  
ECG, LVEF, and vital sign monitoring and 
coagulation tests performed at screening 
and thereaf ter as clinically indicated.  
Blood pressure and vital signs monitored 
closely during the 24 -hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13001] C1 and C2. For subsequent cycles, 
monitoring will depend on site assessment 
of participant’s symptoms.  
Immune -mediated Adverse Events  SAR444245  
A minority of patients in the HAMMER 
study have reported such AE as 
detailed in the IB.  Exclusion of participants with:  
Active, known, or suspected autoimmune 
disease that has required systemic 
treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of 
disea se modifying agents, corticosteroids 
or immunosuppressive drugs), except 
controlled by [CONTACT_13128] 
(eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic 
corticosteroid replacement therapy for 
adrenal or pi[INVESTIGATOR_13002], etc).  
Close monitoring for endocri ne 
abnormalities and other potentially 
autoimmune phenomena will be performed.  
Dose modification and treatment guidelines 
for immune -related reactions are provided 
in individual substudies .

No studies have been conducted with 
SAR444245 on fertility or general 
reproductive performance.  Exclusion of participants who are pregnant 
or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive 
or father children within the projected 
duration of the trial as per inclusion criterion  
I 03. 
Guidance on highly effective contraceptive 
methods is provided in the protocol.

regularly as described in Section  8.2.[ADDRESS_12473] not yet been 
established  Exclusion of participants under 18 years of 
age. 
Participants over 75 years of age  SAR444245  
At this stage of development, no 
safety data are available for this 
population.  No specific mitigation strategy for this 
population.  
Clinically significant medication errors  With the increased complexity of the 
design of oncology clinical trials, 
medication errors need to be 
considered. Although their occurrence 
is estimated to be low 
(eg. chemotherapy errors occur at 
a rate of about one to four per 
1000  orders), their impact may be 
high. According to the report on 
medication safety in cancer clinical 
trials, the processes in which the 
errors originated were prescribing 
(47%), administering (10%), 
dispensing (6%), and monitoring (5%). 
Prescribing errors typi[INVESTIGATOR_13003] (39%, most likely due 
to the protocol procedures differing 
from existing standards of care), 
followed by [CONTACT_13196] (30%), 
and poor communication involving 
both the healthcare team and the 
patient (26%)( 26, 27, 28). Strict adherence to the protocol .  
Adequate and verified training of staff at 
investigational sites  
Overdose and its treatment  There is no specific antidote for 
overdose with SAR444245 . Strict adherence to the protocol; Adequate 
and verified training of staff at 
investigational sites.  
See Section  6.8.  
Study procedures  
Biopsies of tumor tissue are expected 
during the trial.   Strict adherence to the guidance in the

Please refer to the Master Protocol for description of common protocol elements. Cohort -specific 
protocol elements are described below.  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol title:   
A Phase 2 non -randomized, open -label,  multi -cohort, multi -center study assessing the clinical 
benefit of SAR444245 (THOR -707) combined with pembrolizumab  for the treatment of 
participants with advanced and metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  
Brief  title:  A study of SAR444245 combine d with pembrolizumab  for the treatment of 
participants with  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  
Rationale:  
Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and non-human primate  (NHP ) models while anti programmed cell 
death -1 (anti-PD1) antibody prevents T cell suppression through the programmed cell 
death -1/programmed cell death -ligand 1 (PD1 /PD-L1) pathway. The combination of anti -PD1 
treatment with SAR444245 was tested in the syngeneic murine CT -26 colon cancer model and 
induced enhanced anti -tumor activ ity as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13205] (CR ) and tumor -free surviving animals compared to each agent in monotherapy. These 
data support evaluation of SAR444245 in combination with  an anti -PD1 antibody.  
The proposed study aims to establish proof -of-concept that combining the no n-alpha -IL2 
SAR444245 with the anti -PD1 antibody pembrolizumab will result in a significant increase in the 
percentage of patients experiencing an objective r esponse in the setting of advanced unresectable 
or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) .  
Objectives and endpoints   
Please refer to the master protocol . 
Overall design:

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 11 Brief summary :  
Cohort A  will asse ss SAR444245 adding on to pembrolizumab in participants with advanced 
unresectable or metastatic ESCC , regardless of PD -L1 expression (any combined positive score 
[CPS]), who have receive d at least one but no more than two prior lines of treatment and have 
progressed after primary or secondary resistance to an anti -PD-1/PD -L1 based regimen (detailed 
in Section  5.1). Patients wit h known high microsatellite instability (MSI -H) will not be eligible, 
but the determination of the MSI status will not be required for enrollment.  
A graphical presentation of the substudy schema  is shown in Figure  1.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 12 Study sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window 
between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30  minutes -5 min/+10  min).  
SAR444245  
SAR444245 formulation, route of administration, and dose regimen  as described in the master 
protocol. Treatment duration for Cohort A is up to 35 cycles.  
Noninvestigational medicinal products  
Please refer to the master protocol . 
After 4 cycles, i n case of permanent SAR444245 discontinuation and continuation of 
pembrolizumab treatment as part of AE management, premedication no longer needs to be 
administered.

a Evaluation: Screening assessments to be performed prior to first IMP administration unless otherwise indicated. There is no n eed to perform Cycle [ADDRESS_12506] be  performed, and results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_13109]. After Cycle 1, samples for laboratory assessments (excluding PK & biomarker) can be collected up to [ADDRESS_12507] IMP administration in  which study procedures used to support 
eligibility are done.  
b Cycle: a treatment cycle is 21 days. See details in Section  6.1 for IMP administration. If treatment cycles are adjusted, all procedures except tumor assessment imaging will be completed ac cording to the cycle 
number. Tumor assessment imaging will be performed at  fixed time points from C1D1 regardless of any treatment delays.  
c Observation Period: Participants who enter the Observation period will be followed differently depending on the reason leadin g to permanent IMP discontinuation. See Section  4.1. For participant's convenience, all 
Follow -up assessments may occur during the same visit as that when tumor assessment is performed.  
d Survival Phone Call Follow -Up Period: Once the participant stops the tumor  assessments due to PD or starts a new antineoplastic therapy, the participant moves into the Survival Follow -up Period and should be 
contact[CONTACT_13110] 3 months ±14 days to assess for survival status. Updated survival status may be  requested by [CONTACT_13111].  
e For Cycle 4 visits, please refer to PK flowchart in  Section  1.5. 
f C1D8 and/or C1D15 visits must be performed on site for the following part icipants only: 1) Participants scheduled to have blood draws for biomarker assessment and/or ADA on Day 8; 2) Participants wh o will 
receive IMP on Day 8 and Day 15. For all other participants, these 2 on -site visits may be done remotely as appropriate base d on investigator’s discretion per institutional standard and local regulations. If this is 
the case, this must be documented in the source document. Sponsor  may decide to cancel safety assessment on C1D8 and C1D15 if safety data justifies it.  
g Weight/Heig ht: Height is required at baseline only. Weight is required at Screening and prior to starting each infusion. The total dose will be calculated based on the weight on the day of the infusion or the most 
recent weight assuming it was ass essed in a reasonabl e time frame according to Investigator assessment. Study sites should make every effort to measure body weight as close to th e infusion day as possible 
considering the variability of local process from site to site.  If the infusion is prepared with the mos t recent weight assessed in a reasonable time frame, this will not prevent to assess the weight on D1 of each 
cycle.

i Urinalysis using dipstick for glucose, blood, pH, protei n, ketones, leukocytes and microscopic examination (if blood or protein is abnormal), will be pe rformed every 4 cycles during Treatment Period and as 
clinically indicated.  
j Endocrine function tests will be performed every 2 cycles throughout the entire trea tment period and at EOT. During the Observation Period, they will be performed at Follow -Up Visit 1. They can also be performed 
as clinically indicated .  
k Only for pa rticipants who will participate in the intensive PK sample collection.  
l AE/SAE assessment: S everity will be graded according to NCI -CTCAE v 5.0. ICANS and CRS will be graded using ASTCT criteria integrated with central laboratory cytokine results ( 1).   
m If a tumor biopsy was obtained from a target le sion during eligibility assessment, it is preferred to obtain a new baseline scan.  
n Will not be done for participants enrolled in China . 
o Brain imaging: For participants with no previous history of brain metastases, screening brain imaging will need to be o btained. MRI is the preferred imaging modality however CT is acceptable if an MRI is clinically 
contraindicated. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases (ie, no neurological symptoms, no requirements for corticosteroi ds, and no lesion >1.5 cm) may part icipate but will require regular imaging of the brain 
as a site of disease as per protocol tumor assessment (TA) schedule. In all other cases, the lesions must be treated. Two add itional scans, obtained at least 4 weeks apart, should be obtained to documen t disease 
stability after local treatment administration to the brain metastases has been completed. If participants receive therapy du ring these 4 weeks stabilization at the treating physician's discretion, it will be considered 
as part of prior anti -canc er therapy. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable, which is defined as lack of progression on two sets of imaging obtained at least 
[ADDRESS_12509]/MRI: The initial tumor imaging will be performed within 28 days prior to C1D1. Scans performed as part of routine clinical  management are acceptable for use as the screening scan if they are of diagnostic 
quality and performed within 28 days prior to the date of enrollment. On study imaging will be performed every 9 weeks (63 ± 7 days) afte r the date of first IMP and if clinically indicated. Imaging studies should 
follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for del ays in cycle starts or extension. The same imaging technique should be used in a participant throughout the trial. After week  45, tumor imaging should be 
performed every 12 weeks (84 ± 7 days). CT scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and any other locations with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_13013], during 
treatment period until PD. Per the primary tumor assessment criteria, after the first documentation of response or the first documentation of progression (if the participant is clinically stable), confirmatory imaging 
may be performed no fewer than 28 days later. Alternately, the scan performed at the next scheduled time point (eg, every 63 ±7 days) may be used as confirmation. Tumor assessment is not needed fo r 
participants who start another anti -cancer therapy.

This study  is developed as a master protocol in order to accelerate  the investigation of 
SAR444245 with various  anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13014] . The 
information that is common to all cohorts is included in the master protocol, and this substudy 
provides details specific to cohort with ESCC  for the combination therapy with pembrolizumab.  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Preclinical studies de monstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and NHP models while anti -PD1 antibody prevents T cell suppression 
through the PD1/PD -L1 pathway. The combination of anti -PD1 treatment with SAR444245 was 
tested in a syngeneic mouse CT -26 colon cancer model and induced enhanced anti -tumor activity 
as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13206] -free surviving animals compared to 
each agent in monotherapy. These data support evaluation of SAR444245 in com bination with 
pembrolizumab.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
2.2.1  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the PD1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and 
programmed ce ll death ligand 2  (PD-L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has 
high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable 
preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an IV immunotherapy f or advanced 
malignancies. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across 
a number of indications.  
Refer to the country approved labeling for detailed background information on pembrolizumab.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmaceutical and therapeutic backgr ound   
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades  (2). Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infilt rating lymphocytes (TIL s) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T cells/FoxP3+ regulatory  T-cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular 
carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and RCC. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded 
ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as 
melanoma  (3, 4).

Version number:   
[ADDRESS_12510] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207]. The normal function of PD1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13208]1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily 
member related to cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
protein 4 (CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement of its ligan ds (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) (5, 6). 
The structure of murine PD1 has been resolved (7). PD1 and its family members are T ype I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable -type (IgV type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling mot ifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following 
T-cell stimulation, PD1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP -2, to the 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its c ytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta 
(PKCθ), and zeta -chain -associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell 
signaling cascade (6, 8, 9, 10). The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]1 down -modulates T cell responses is 
similar to, bu t distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13015] (11, 12).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-clinical trials   
Therapeutic studies in m ouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking 
PD1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads 
to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities 
(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19). Anti -mouse PD1 or anti -mouse PD -L1 antibodies have demonstrated 
antitumor responses in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma,  
acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal carcinoma (7, 16, 18, 19, 20). In such studies, tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and increased IFN -γ, granzyme B and perforin expression were 
observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD1 checkpoint 
inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo (18). 
Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy of anti -mouse PD1 antibody as a monotherapy, 
as well as in combinat ion with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models 
(see pembrolizumab IB).  
A summary of clinical trial data and the justification of the choice of pembrolizumab dose is 
provided in Section  4.3.2 . 
2.2.2  Rationale for ESCC and selected population (Cohort A)   
Esophageal cancer is ranked as the sixth leading cause of cancer -related deaths. Although the 
incidence of adenocarcinoma is increasing in Western countries, esophageal squamous c ell 
carcinoma (ESCC) is the major histology in Asian countries including Japan. Although driver 
gene mutations have not been detected in ESCC, the somatic mutation rate in ESCC is relatively 
high compared with other solid tumors  (21). Up to the event of ICI, there was no agents that had 
shown clear efficacy in ESCC (22).

Property of the San ofi group - strictly confidential  Page 25 In the multi -cohort Phase 1 b KEYNOTE -028 study, pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated 
promisi ng antitumor activity in patients having heavily pre -treated esophageal carcinoma with 
PD-L1 ≥ 1%. Thirty -seven (45%) of patients had PD -L1 positive tumor, and ORR was 30% (28% 
in ESCC) with a median duration of response of 15 months (23). The subsequent phase II, 
single -arm KEYNOTE -[ADDRESS_12511] failed two or more lines of 
therapy (24). PD-L1 expression, defined as a CPS of 10 or higher asse ssed by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC), was reported in 47.9%, and 52.1% of the 121 enrolled patients had 
ESCC. The ORR of the entire cohort was 9.9%, and numerically higher response rate was 
observed in those tumors with PD -L1 expression (ORR 13.8%) and ESCC (ORR 14.3%). The 
results were echoed in the phase II, single -arm Attraction -01/ONO -[ADDRESS_12512] treatments (25). PD-L1 expression was not required for study entry; the ORR was 17 .2% 
and the responses were durable  (26).  
In the KEYNOTE -181 randomized Phase 3 study, pembrolizumab monotherapy was compared to 
the investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients with advanced esophageal cancers, all 
histologies, who had received only one prior line of treatment. The primary objectives were 
overall survival (OS) in patients with PD -L1 CPS ≥10, ESCC and in the tot al population. 
Compared with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, pembrolizumab monotherapy significantly 
improved OS in PD -L1 CPS ≥10 (9.3 versus 6.7 months, HR 0.69) and ESCC (8.[ADDRESS_12513] ratio [HR] 0.78) but not in the total populati on (7.1 versus 7.1 months, HR 
0.89). In addition, the ORRs were significantly higher with pembrolizumab than chemotherapy. It 
reached 21.5% in PD -L1 CPS ≥10 (versus 6.1% with chemotherapy; p = 0.0006), 16.7% in ESCC 
(versus 7.4% with chemotherapy; p = 0.00 22), and 13.1% in total population (versus 6.7% with 
chemotherapy; p = 0.0037). In patients with ESCC and PD -L1 CPS ≥10, the ORR (22% versus 
6%) and OS (10.3 months versus 6.7 months, HR=0.64) were significantly higher with 
pembrolizumab than chemotherapy.   For the specific setting of patients with ESCC and PD -L1 
CPS ≥10, the ORR of 22% (versus 6%) and OS of 10.3 months (versus 6.7 months, HR =0.64 ) 
were significantly higher with pembrolizumab than chemotherapy. Based on these data of 
Keynote -181 study, pemb rolizumab  received FDA approval for use in patients with recurrent or 
metastatic ESCC with a  CPS ≥10 in the 2L setting (27). Nivolumab single  agent is approved 
regardless of PDL1 expression in Japan and other Asian countries, and was also recently approved 
in the US and EU based on Attraction -3 data (28). Results from the randomized, international, 
double -blind KEYNOTE -590 study of 1L pembrolizumab + chemotherapy v s chemo alone in 
patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma or ESCC or 
Siewert type 1 gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEJ) were reported at ESMO 2020 (29). At data 
cutoff, 749 patients (73% ESCC) were randomized. Median follow -up was 10.8 months. Pembro 
+ chemo versus chemo was superior for OS in patients with ESCC CPS ≥10 (13.9 versus 
8.8 months; HR 0.57), ESCC (12.6 versus 9.8 months; HR 0.72), CPS ≥10 (13.5 versus 
9.4 months; HR 0.62), and all patients (median 12.4 versus 9.8 months; HR, 0.73). Confirmed 
ORR was 45.0% versus 29.3% (P  <0.0001) in all patients, with median DoR of 8.3 versus 6.0 
months. Safety profile was manageable but discontinuation rates from drug -related AEs was 
slightly higher in the combination arm (19% versus 12%). Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy may 
be the new SoC for this population in 1L, regardless of histology and PD -L1 expression. 
Nevertheless, >50% of patients do not respond, and some will re lapse. In the proposed study, the 
antitumor activity of pembrolizumab when combined with SAR444245 will be evaluated in the 
population patients in [ADDRESS_12514] failed or relapsed on an anti -PD-1/PD -L1.

generation, investigational IL -2 analog NKTR -214 (bempegaldesleukin).   
Risk assessment of SAR444245 when combined with pembrolizumab  results from anticipated 
risks for SAR444245 and from the label information for Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), taking into 
account potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13016]. The available safety data for pembroliz umab, along with 
proposed mitigation strategies are summarized below and also provided in Table  11. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab potentiates T -cell responses, including antitumor responses, through blockade of 
PD1 b inding to PD -L1 and PD -L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be 
expressed by [CONTACT_13210] (TME) . 
The use of pembrolizumab may cause  IRRs  (drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, 
anaphylacto id reaction, and hypersensitivity) . Pembrolizumab use may be associated with  
infections (pneumonia), bone marrow suppression (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), 
increase in the level of hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransfer ase, 
alkaline phosphatase), kidney damage (nephritis, acute kidney injury), as well as adverse effects 
on the functioning of nervous system (dizziness, headache, peripheral neuropathy, dysgeusia (very 
common) and lethargy). In combination therapy with othe r chemotherapeutic drugs, 
pembrolizumab administration is commonly associated with hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia 
(including atrial fibrillation).  
Immune -mediated adverse events are designated as important identified risk s for pembrolizumab 
(30). 
Immune -related adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. Most immune -related adverse reactions occurring during treatment 
with pembrolizumab were rever sible and managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune -related adverse reactions have 
also occurred after the last dose of pembrolizumab. Immune -related adverse reactions affecting 
more than one body system can occur simultaneously.  
Among the  immune -related AEs  (irAEs ) associated with pembrolizumab are: immune -related 
pneumonitis, immune -related colitis, immune -related hepatitis, immune -related nephritis, 
immune -related endocrinopathies, immun e-related skin adverse reactions and other additional 
clinically significant, immune -related adverse reactions (reported in clinical studies or in 
post-marketing experience): uveitis, arthritis, myositis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, Guillain -Barré 
syndrome,  myasthenic syndrome, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, encephalitis, and myelitis.  
Efficacy and safety data for pembrolizumab from patients ≥75 years are limited. In this 
population, pembrolizumab combination therapy should be used with caution after careful  
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.

[IP_ADDRESS]  SAR444245 combined with pembrolizumab  
Combining SAR444245 with pembrolizumab may lead to an increased frequency and/or severity 
of adverse events ( AEs) related to immune activation or may lead to additional AEs related to 
immune system activation for eac h substance individually or may cause occurrences of 
qualitatively different AEs. Serious adverse drug reactions reported with agents known to increase 
immune activation include pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, colitis, and hormonal dysfunction  
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
As both substances are biologic agents, they may have the propensity to induce infusion -related 
reactions that may have higher rate of occurrence and severity when  SAR444245 with 
pembrolizumab are used in combination.  
The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of SAR444245 combined with the approved dosing of the 
anti PD -[ADDRESS_12517] -26, relatively resistant to immune checkpoint treatment, 
SAR444245 potentiated the activity of an anti -PD1 antibody. Combination treatment in animals, 
when compared to respec tive monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], increased the number of complete responses and 
prolonged survival which was durable as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13211]-engraftment on the tumor free animals, indicating the establishment of durable memory T -cell 
population in response to the initial treatment (see SAR444245 IB).  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved in most of the indications proposed to be tested in this 
study (please refer to Section  2.1 - Study Rationale): ESCC, gastric and gastroesophageal, HCC. 
In gastric cancer and ESCC, the main benefit of pembrolizumab is brought to patients with 
diseases that have a relatively high expression of PD -L1 (CP S ≥10). Combining SAR444245 to 
pembrolizumab is anticipated to expand to population responding to the anti -PD1 and to increase 
the quality of the response. Such effects have been demonstrated in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_12964] -02 study for 
bempegaldesleukin combined with nivolu mab in metastatic melanoma, achieving deep and 
durable responses with rates of CR of 34% and PFS (30.9 months) exceeding that reported in 
clinical trials for approved treatments (31). Objective responses were also documented in PDL1 
negative cases (n=13), with an ORR of 39% and 3 patients achieving 100% reduction of target 
lesions, and 2 patients achieving CR. Echoing these results are those of the same combination in 
1L metastatic urothelial carcinoma, an indi cation where response to immune checkpoint is linked 
to the level of expression of PD -L1. In this study, bempegaldesleulin when combined with 
nivolumab induced significant ORR with 17% CR, with ORR similar and PD -L1 negative (50%)

4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
Cohort A  will assess SAR444245 adding on to pemb rolizumab in participants with advanced 
unresectable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ), regardless of 
programmed cell death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) expression (any combined positive score [CPS ]), who 
have received no more than two prior lines of treatment and have progressed after primary or 
secondary resistance to an anti -PD-1/PD -L1 based regimen (detailed in  Section  5.1). Patients with 
known high MSI -H will not be eligible, but the determination of the MSI status will not be 
required for enrollment.  
Please refer to the master protocol for a full description of the study design, and for details 
applicable to a ll therapy cohorts.

Property of the San ofi group - strictly confidential  Page 31 4.3.2  Pembrolizumab dose   
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the 
totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is an appropriate 
dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications. As outlined below, this dose is justified 
by: 
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies in melanoma and NSCLC indications 
demonstrating flat dose - and exposure -efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W)  representing an approximate 5 to 7.5 fold exposure range 
(refer to the pembrolizumab IB) . 
• Population PK analysis showing that both fixed dosing and weight -based dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability with considerable  overlap in the distributions of 
exposures, supporting suitability of 200 mg Q3W . 
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications. And  
• Pharmacology data showing full target s aturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK [PBPK] analysis) at 
200 mg Q3W.  
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with 
melanoma and NS CLC, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, 
PD-L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001  Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 
10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of 
these studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -response relationships across the doses st udied 
representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 - fold difference in exposure. The  2 mg/kg (or 200 mg 
fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat 
dose-exposure -response relationships were also observed in other tu mor types including head and 
neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 
[ADDRESS_12520], PK data in 
KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusivel y demonstrated 
saturation of PD1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than [ADDRESS_12521] tumor PD1 saturation over a wide range of tumor 
penetration and PD1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pe mbrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W 
achieves full PD1 saturation in both blood and tumor.

Property of the San ofi group - strictly confidential  Page 32 Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body 
weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing  provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by 
[CONTACT_13212] -dose has advantag es of reduced dosing complexity 
and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was selected for evaluation

Type of participant and disease characteristics  
I 01. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of  esophageal cancer of the squamous 
cell carcinoma  subtype.  
I 02. Confirmed diagnosis at study entry of advanced u nresectable or metastatic disease .   
Note: For participants in Cohort A : Disease with any CPS scoring. No need for CPS 
determination at local laboratory.  
I 03. MSI status : Participants must have either unknown MSI status or if MSI status is known, 
participants m ust have non -MSI-H disease to be eligible . 
I 04. Prior anticancer therapy : Participants should have received at least one but no more than 
2 prior lines of treatment, including an anti -PD-1/PDL -[ADDRESS_12523] 
progressed after a primary or secondar y resistance to an anti -PD-1/PDL -1. 
Note: For Cohorts A:  
Primary resistance  is defined as a patient who has experienced progressive disease (PD) or SD 
lasting <6 months of initiation of PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor -based treatment and who received at least 
6 week s of the PD1/PD -L1. Radiographic confirmation of the PD must be documented after 
a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial identification of progression, unless: i) investigator 
confirms clinical progression/ deterioration attributed to PD, or ii) the first r adiographic 
assessment indicated critical tumor growth by [CONTACT_9661] (size or location).   
Or 
Secondary resistance : patients must have experienced PD, either during or within 3 months of 
discontinuing treatment with anti -PD1-based therapy, occurring after pre vious clear benefit (any 
complete [CR] or partial response [PR]), or after previous stable disease (SD) >6 months. 
No requirement for radiographic confirmation of progression.  
An anti -PD1/PD -L1 containing regimen is defined as either an anti -PD1/PD -L1 mono therapy, or 
an anti -PD1/PD -L1 agent administered in the same cycle as another systemic anticancer therapy. 
If PD1/PD -L1 was used beyond initial radiological progression while continuing to use the same 
PD1/PD -L1 agent used before PD, it’s still considered as the same regimen. The site’s study team 
must have reviewed previous tumor assessments (including screening tumor imaging) to 
determine that radiographic progression has occurred per RECIST 1.1 following initiation of the 
anti-PD1/PD -L1 containing regime n.

according to following rules:  
• For Q3W IMP administration: If toxicity occurs and the participant  does not recover on the 
day of planned administration, the cycle will be delayed; restart of study IMPs could occur 
only on the initiation of the subsequent cycle.  
• In case of cycle delay for the recovery of toxicity, the following rules should be followed  
for restart or discontinuation of the treatment:  
- In case of a cycle delay up to 14 days, it is per Investigator’s decision to restart the 
study treatment.  
- After a cycle delay of >14 days and ≤84 days, it is per Investigator’s decision to restart 
the study treatment, if a clear benefit from treatment is observed and after consultation 
with the Sponsor.  
- The study treatment must be permanently discontinued if t he cycle delay is longer than 
84 days.

logistical reasons not related to study therapy. Participants should be placed back on study 
therapy within 21 days of the schedu led delay , unless otherwise discussed with the 
Sponsor (for example for national or regional emergencies). The reason for the delay  
should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
6.5.3  General guidelines for the management of treatment -related adverse e vents   
Participants  who experience Grade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the study (including clinically 
significant Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities as defined in Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol ) 
not listed in Section  6.5.4  (Tables 3 -8) will be required to temporarily delay the IMP. After cycle 
delay, such participants may be considered  for treatment resumption  once the TRAE resolves or 
improves to Grade 1 or baselin e  
The dose of SAR444245 should  be reduced to  μg/kg (with the exception of lymphocytopenia 
which is directly associated with SAR444245 mode -of-action and does not require dose 
reduction) in cases of:  
• First occurrence of Grade 3 TRAE that does not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within  
72 hours, and second occurrence of Grade 3 TRAE of any duration.  
• Grade 4 TRAE . 
• First occurrence of Grade 3 laboratory abnormality that are clinically significant per  
Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol . and that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline wit hin 
72 hours, and second occurrence of Grade 3 clinically significant laboratory abnormality 
of any duration.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_12531] scheduled dose.  
The cycle delay of treatment for Grade 2 events  is left at the discretion of the Investigator unless 
otherwise specified  in this protocol.   
No cycle delay of treatment or dose modification is required for Grade 1  events.  
The final decision on dose modification and/or corrective therapy will be based on the 
Investigator’s judgment, in the best interest of the participant.  
Recommended guidelines for the management of specific adverse events including irAE, CRS, 
Vascular Leak Syndrome (VLS ) and Infusion -related reactions ( IRR) are presented in 
Section  6.5.4 .

Terminology Cr iteria for Adverse Event (NCI -CTCAE ) V5.0 (see Section 8.3.8  of the master 
protocol ). In case a specific adverse event meets the AESI definition  it must be documented in the 
e-CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -relat ed reactions (I RR)  
Participants should routinely receive premedication as detailed in Section 6.1.2 .1 of the master 
protocol prior to SAR444245 administration, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severi ty of 
IRRs.  
An infusion -related reaction in this study is defined as any signs or symptoms which develop 
during the infusion or up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion. The term IRR indicates 
only a specific temporal relationship with the infus ion and does not specify a particular 
mechanism underlying the signs or symptoms.   
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening infusion -reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug 
infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. Dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines on pembrolizumab -associated infusion reaction 
are provided in Table  3.  
After an infusion -related reaction due to pembrolizumab infusion (Grade 3 or Grade 4), the 
SAR444245 infusion will be delayed and can be administered after resolution of symptoms. The 
Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor if the SAR444245 infusion needs 
to be delayed more than [ADDRESS_12533] the next SAR444245 infusion  given at half the infusion 
rate. For instructions on premedication at subsequent dosing, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Fever, flu -like symptoms and cytokine -release syndrome (CRS)  
Fever can frequently happen with infusion of IL -2 and may possibly evolve into flu -like 
symptoms or could be  an early manifestation of CRS. Fever or flu -like symptoms should be 
graded according to CTCAE V5.0 and managed according to institutional standards.  
Cytokine -release syndrome should be graded as per American Society for Transplantation and 
Cellular Thera py (ASTCT ) criteria integrated with central laboratory cytokine results, and 
managed per guidelines in Table 5. If any gra de of CRS is suspected, sites should make every 
effort to draw an additional blood sample for cytokines levels (by [CONTACT_12115]) prior to the 
administration of tocilizumab, as well as C -reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin (by [CONTACT_13213]).  
Sites  should have at least 2 full doses of tocilizumab available and access to an intensive care unit 
(ICU ), in case participants develop CRS.  
Guidelines for management of CRS according to severity grading ar e provided in Table 5.

subsequent treatment should be resumed only when symptoms have resolved 
or improved to Grade 1  at µg/kg or permanently discontinued, as clinically 
indicated.  
If CRS Grade 4, SAR444245 should be permanently discontinued as clinically 
indicated.  
If CRS Grade 3 or Grade 4, IV corticosteroids should be initiated (outside of the 
context of CAR -T cells, corticosteroids alone maybe initiated in first intention) 
and tocilizumab considered, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027]/or other vasopressors 
should be administered as needed. Participants with severe CRS may require 
management in intensive car e setting, with monitoring of clinical status and 
laboratory tests performed at least daily.  
As the participant improves, the intensity of the monitoring and setting can be 
decreased, but the participant should not be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13028]. Corticosteroids can then be administered IV  or orally every 
8 hours for up to 3 days, then tapered over 4 days. In general, tapering of 
steroids can start when vasopressors and high -flow oxygen are no longer 
needed.  
CRS is considered resol ved when there is sustained resolution of fever and 
there is no longer a need for oxygen supplementation to relieve hypoxia nor 
vasopressors to maintain blood pressure; however, normalization of 
temperature alone does not define resolution of CRS.  
 If no clinical improvement in oxygenation, hypotension, fever, and other CRS 
manifestations is observed within 24 to 72 hours, management for persistent or 
worsening CRS should be initiated. Re -evaluation for other contributing 
conditions should be done, such as  infection, cardiac, thromboembolic and 
other complications. Intravenous Tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg (for participants  
weighing ≥30 kg) should be administered, and steroids should be administered 
concurrently. If still no improvement in oxygenation, hypotension , fever and 
other manifestations is observed after the first dose of tocilizumab, it may be 
repeated after an inte rval of at least 8 hours and should not exceed 4 doses in 
total.  
For participants with severe CRS who fail to improve after repetitive treatment 
with both tocilizumab and steroids, alternative options should be discussed with 
clinical site specialists  
a Information for preparation and storage of SAR444245 is provided in the pharmacy manual.  
b Fever is defined as temperature ≥38°C not attributable to any other cause. In patients who have CRS then receive antipyretic or anticytokine 
therapy such as tocilizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS severity. In this case , CRS grading is driven by 
[CONTACT_13199]/or hypoxia.  
c CRS grade is determined by [CONTACT_13200]: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, a patient with 
temperature of 39.5°C, hypotension requiring 1 vasopressor, and  hypoxia requiring low -flow nasal cannula is classified as Grade  3 CRS.  
d Low-flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at ≤6 L/minute. Low flow also includes blow -by [CONTACT_13201], sometimes used in 
pediatrics. High -flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at >6 L/minute.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune -related adverse events   
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the 
last dose of pembrolizumab trea tment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. 
IrAEs are thought to be caused by [CONTACT_13214]. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce 
comp lications. Based on existing pembrolizumab clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible 
and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids 
and/or other supportive care.  
Investigators must be extremely vigilant a nd be ready to intervene early in the management of 
irAEs because the onset of symptoms of irAEs (eg, pneumonitis) may be subtle. For suspected 
irAEs, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm etiology or exclude neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic,  toxin, or other etiologic causes. Additional procedures or tests such as 
bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the 
severity of irAEs, withhold  or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab  and/or SAR444245  and 
administer corticosteroids.  
SAR444245 may increase the incidence and severity of these events.  
Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs are provided in Table  6. Of 
note, when study interventi ons are administered in combination, if the AE is considered immune -
related, both drugs in the combination should be held according to recommended dose 
modifications.  If a participant experiences several irAEs, the most conservative recommendation 
should be followed.  
The CTCAE V5.[ADDRESS_12535] be used to grade the severity of AEs.  
When pembrolizumab can be restarted, it should be administered at the initial planned dose and 
schedule as no modification is allowed:  
• If the toxicity does not resolve or the criteria for resuming treatment are not met, the 
participant must be discontinued from all study drugs.  
• If the toxicities do resolve and conditions are aligned with what is defined in Table  6, the 
combination of SAR444245 o r pembrolizumab may be restarted at the discretion of the 
investigator.  In these cases where the toxicity is attributed to the combination or to 
SAR444245 alone, re -initiation of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy may be considered 
after communication with the  Sponsor.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)  
Immune cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome is a neuropsychiatric syndro me which is frequently 
associated with CRS; however, it is specifically excluded from the definition of CRS and can occur 
during the course of CRS, after its resolution, or independently from CRS. Clinical findings can be 
progressive and may include aphasi a, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, 
motor weakness, seizure, and cerebral edema. Severity is evaluated using the ASTCT Consensus 
grading scale, with ICE score for encephalopathy assessment ( Section 10.1 1 of the master protoco l). 
Recommendations for ICANS ) management mainly include the use of steroids, whereas tocilizumab 
should only be used in the context of CRS, as outlined in Table 7. The proposed management should 
be considered only as recommendations and in light of recommendations from site specialist.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Vascular leak syndrome (VLS)  
Vascular leak syndrome is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_13218]. This syndrome 
is observed in patients who demonstrate a state of generalized leaky capi[INVESTIGATOR_13032], low -flow states, ischemia -reperfusion injuries, toxemi as, medications, or poisoning. 
In various human diseases, an increase in capi[INVESTIGATOR_13033] -rich fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space manifested by [CONTACT_13219]: diffuse pi[INVESTIGATOR_13034], exudative serous cavity effusions, 
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, and, in some cases, hypovolemic shock with 
multiple -organ failure.  Fluid management is the cornerstone of VLS management; it is a balance 
between maintai ning the intravascular volume to ensure organ perfusion to prevent organ failure, 
while avoiding volume overload. The management of VLS according to severity grading is 
described in Table 8. These guidelines are not  comprehensive and the Investigator should exercise 
clinical judgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual participant and refer to 
current guidelines to the topic ( 40).

The initial strategy is to administer boluses of crystalloids with a goal of

Severe symptoms; intervention indicated

In participants  with severe shock, blood press ure may be only partially 
responsive or refractory to IV crystalloid fluids.  
Severe or persistent hypotension is to be managed by [CONTACT_13220]. A trial of 25% albumin IV is an additional option, although its 
efficacy is limited to th ose with a severe capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946]. In those who remain 
with refractory shock in the setting of low filling pressures, high molecular 
weight starches such as hetastarch (MW 450 kDa) and pentastarch (MW 
264 kDa) may be effective in expanding the intravascular  volume. 
Supportive care with invasive and noninvasive ventilation as well as renal 
replacement may be necessary in severe cases. When available, disease -
specific therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to facilitate 
recovery.  
During the recovery phase from severe capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], the endothelial injury 
resolves and the capi[INVESTIGATOR_13035], resulting in 
stabilization of blood pressure, at which time fluid overload symptoms and 
signs may predominate (eg, pulmonary edema, pleural eff usions, acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], systemic edema, ascites). Volume removal 
with loop diuretics is the first -line therapy in these patients. In those with 
marginal blood pressure and fluid overload, the combination of loop 
diuretics and 25% album in IV may facilitate volume removal. Patients with 
AKI refractory to diuretics will require renal replacement.

Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR  
(whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively 
docume nted, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded on study (including 
baseline).  
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on st udy (including baseline).  
10.9.[ADDRESS_12555] their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small ( eg, 2 mm). If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13036] t the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned. For lesions which fragment/split add together  the longest diameters of the fragmented 
portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure the maximal longest diameter for the “merged 
lesion.”  
Clinical Lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥10 mm as assessed using calipers ( eg, skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion i s 
recommended. If feasible, imaging is preferred.

[ADDRESS_12556] is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions.  
However, lesions  ≥[ADDRESS_12557] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
MRI is also accepta ble in certain situations ( eg, for body scans). Other specialized imaging or 
other techniques may also be appropriate for individual case. For example, while PET scans are 
not considered adequate to measure lesions, PET -CT scans may be used providing that the 
measures are obtained from the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast).  
Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as 
a method of measuremen t. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], 
confirmation by [CONTACT_13222].  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm com plete pathological response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor Markers.  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response . If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in CR.  
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for exam ple, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be 
a potential adverse effect of treatment ( eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytolo gical confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is advised to differentiate between response or SD and PD.

Property of the San ofi group - strictly confidential  Page 65 10.14.1  Amended protocol 01  ([ADDRESS_12558]  2021 ) 
This amended protocol (Amendment 01) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.  
OVERALL RAT IONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The overall rationale for the amendment is to  include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13037] -related adverse events ( TRAEs ) for Cohort  A in 
substudy 01.  
Protocol amendment summar y of changes table  
Section # and 
Name  [CONTACT_9353] 5.1 Inclusion 
Criteria  I04 has been  revised from “Participants should 
have received at least but no more than 2 prior 
lines of treatment… ” to “Participants should have 
received at least one but no more than 2 prior 
lines of treatment…”.  For correction.  
In I06, “- less than required number of slides or 
archival tumor tissue sample collected more than 
6 months prior to screening” has been revised to 
“-less than required num ber of slides or archival 
tumor tissue sample collected more than 6 months 
prior to enrollment ”. Harmonization per program level approach . 
Section 6.5.1 General 
rules  The following sentence has been deleted “ Once 
a dose has been decreased, intra -patient 
re-escalation back to the previous dose level is 
not permitted. ”, and the following sentences have 
been added “ In participants who have SAR444245 
dose reduction due to SAR444245 related Grade 
≥3 TRAEs, SAR444245 dose may be 
re-escalated to  μg/kg if: •no SAR444245 
related Grade ≥[ADDRESS_12559] 
2 subsequent cycles, AND •both Investigator and 
Sponsor agree that the participant has clinical 
benefit. ”. For clarification of how dose will be reduced  
and re -escalated for participants who 
experience any Grade ≥3 TRAEs . 
Section 6.5.3 General 
guidelines for the 
management of 
treatment -related 
adverse events  The following sentence “ Participants who 
experience Grade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the 
study (including c linically significant Grade 3 
laboratory abnormalities as defined in Section 
10.3.1 of the master protocol) will be required to 
temporarily delay the IMP, unless specified For consistency and clarity.

Property of the San ofi group - strictly confidential  Page 66 Section # and 
Name  [CONTACT_13259], and with the exception 
of the TRAEs resolving within 5 da ys. After cycle 
delay, such participants may be considered for 
treatment resumption once the TRAE resolves or 
improves to Grade 1 or baseline or is stable and 
manageable through supportive/medical therapy. ” 
has been changed to “ Participants who 
experience Grade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the 
study (including clinically significant Grade 3 
laboratory abnormalities as defined in 
Section  10.3.1 of the master protocol) not listed in 
Section 6.5.4 (Tables 3 -8) will be required to 
temporarily delay the IMP. After cy cle delay, such 
participants may be considered for treatment 
resumption once the TRAE resolves or improves 
to Grade 1 or baseline ”. 
Dose reduction rules have added, and the 
following sentence has been deleted “ Dose 
reduction for SAR444245 from µg/kg to  
µg/kg (or another lower recommended dose) may 
be decided when specified in the protocol or 
following discussions with the Sponsor. ” . 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Infusion -related 
reactions (IRR)  In Table 4 under Grade 3 and Grade 4, 
“prematurely” has been removed from 
“prematurely permanently discontinued”.  For clarity.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Fever, 
flu-like symptoms and 
cytokine -release 
syndrome (CRS)  In Table 5 under Grade 3, the following sentence 
was deleted “I f subsequent administration is 
tolerated, increasing the SAR444245 dose to 
µg/kg at subsequent administration can be 
considered based on the clinical judgement of the 
Investigator with the Sponsor ”. For consistency.  
Section 9.[ADDRESS_12560] been a dded “ If the 
predictive probability of concluding a minimum 
clinical meaningful effect of the study treatment 
(ORR of 5%) at the end of study is <15%, the 
corresponding cohort will be stopped for futility. To 
facilitate the calculation of predictive probab ility, 
a minimum informative prior of Beta  (0.5, 0.5) is 
used at the time of the design of the study. 
However, emerging data generated from outside 
of the study may warrant a different prior to be 
considered before this interim analysis. ”. To include stopp ing rules for futility .

Please refer to the Master Protocol for description of common protocol elements. Cohort -specific 
protocol elements are described below.  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol title:   
A Phase 2 non -randomized, open -label, multi -cohort, multi -center study assessing the clinical 
benefit of SAR444245 (THOR -707) combined with pembrolizumab  for the treatment of 
participants with advanced and metastatic gastric cancer  or gastro -esophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma  
Brief  title:  A study of SAR444245 co mbined with pembrolizumab  for the treatment of 
participants with gastric cancer or gastro -esophageal junction adenocarcinoma  
Rationale:  
Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine a nd non-human primate  (NHP ) models while anti -PD1 antibody prevents 
T cell suppression through the programmed cell death -1/programmed cell death -ligand 1 
(PD1 /PD-L1) pathway. The combination of anti -PD1 treatment with SAR444245 was tested in 
the syngeneic murine CT -26 colon cancer model and induced enhanced anti -tumor activi ty as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_13226] (CR ) and tumor -free surviving 
animals compared to each agent in monotherapy. These data support evaluation of SAR444245 in 
combination with an anti -PD1 antibody.  
High -level microsatellite instability ( MSI-H) has been associated with better clinical outcomes  in 
metastatic gastroesophageal cancer participants treated by [CONTACT_4002]1/PD -L1-based regimens  but the 
prevalence of MSI -H in metastatic gastric c ancer is low (~10%). Hence , the proposed study would 
focus on non MSI -H tumors with a large unmet need to establish proof -of-concept that combining 
the no n-alpha -IL2 SAR444245 with the anti -PD1 antibody pembrolizumab will result in 
a significant increase i n the percentage of patients experiencing an objective response in the 
setting of advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer or gastro -esophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma  (GC/GEJ ), especially with low PD -L1 expression or after progression on prior 
PD1/PD -L1-based regimens.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 11 Brief summary :  
Cohorts B1, B2  and B3 will assess SAR444245 adding on to pembrolizumab in participants with 
advan ced unresectable or metastatic GC  or Siewert Type  2 & [ADDRESS_12578] of care (SOC) is not of best interest ( for example, participants  who are not eligible, 
cannot tolerate, decline to receive, or have no access to such treatment)  or where no SOC is 
established. MSI -H cases will not be eligible. HER2 + cases will not be eligible unless they have 
progressed on a tra stuzumab -based treatment.   
• Cohorts B1  & B2 participants must not have received more than two prior lines of 
treatment that did not include an anti -PD1/PD -L1-based regimen. Participants will be 
assigned to one of these 2 cohorts according to the level of P D-L1 expression at baseline 
using the CPS as follow:  
- Cohort B1: participants with CPS ≥1 GC/GEJ  
- Cohort B2 : participants with CPS <1 GC/GEJ  
• Cohort B3 participants are eligible regardless of the disease CPS status and must have 
received at least one and no m ore than three prior lines of treatment and have progressed 
after primary or secondary resistance to an anti -PD1/PD -L1-based regimen (detailed in 
Section  5.1). 
A graphical presen tation of the substudy schema is shown Figure  1.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 12 Number of participants:  
Overall, approximately 40 participants will be enrolled a nd treated in each of Cohort s B1, B2, and 
B3. 
Intervention  groups and duration:  
Please refer to the master protocol for common description of the study duration for a participant 
in Cohort s B1, B2, and B3 . For treatment period, the completion of Cycle 35 i s applicable for all 
3 cohorts .  
Study intervention(s)  
Dosing sequence:
Investigational medicinal products  
Pembrolizumab  
• Formulation : Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) as 100 mg/4 mL (25 mg/mL) solution in 
single -dose vials  
• Route of administration : intravenous (IV) infusion.  
• Dose regimen : Pembrolizuma b will be administered as a dose of 200 mg using 
a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3 -week treatment cycle for up to 35 cycles . 
Study sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible. However, given th e variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window 
between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 
30 minutes -5 min/+10  min).  
SAR444245  
SAR444245 formulation, route of administration, and dose regimen as described in the mas ter 
protocol. Treatment duration for Cohort s B1, B2, and B3  is up to 35 cycles.  
Noninvestigational medicinal products  
Please refer to the master protocol.  
After 4 cycles, i n case of permanent SAR444245 discontinuation and continuation of 
pembrolizumab trea tment as part of AE management, premedication no longer needs to be 
administered.  
Statistical considerations:  
Please refer to master protocol.

There is no need to perform Cycle  [ADDRESS_12591] be performed, and results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_13227]. After Cycle 1, samples for laboratory assessments (excluding PK & biomarker) can be collected up  to [ADDRESS_12592] IMP a dministration in which study procedures used to support 
eligibility are done.  
b Cycle: a treatment cycle is 21 days. See details in Section  6.1 for IMP administration. If treatment cycles are adju sted, all procedures except tumor assessment imaging will be completed according to the cycle 
number. Tumor assessment imaging will be performed at fixed time points from C1D1 regardless of any treatment delays.  
c Observation Period: Participants who enter t he Observation period will be followed differently depending on the reason leading to permanent IMP discontinuation. See Section  4.1. For participant's convenience, all 
Follow -up assessments may  occur during the same visit as that when tumor assessment is performed.  
d Survival Phone Call Follow -Up Period: Once the participant stops the tumor assessments due to PD or starts a new antineoplastic therapy, the participant  moves into the Survival Follow -up Period and should be 
contact[CONTACT_13110] 3 months ±14 days to assess for survival status. Updated survival status may be re quested by [CONTACT_13111].  
e For Cycle 4 visits, please refer to PK flowchart in Section  1.5. 
f C1D8 and/or C1D15 visits must be performed on site for the following participants only: 1) Participants scheduled to have blo od draws for biomarker assessment and/or ADA on Day 8; 2)  Participants who will 
receive IMP on Day 8 and Day 15. For all other participants, these 2 on -site visits may be done remotely as appropriate based on investigator’s discretion per institutional standard and local regul ations. If this is 
the case, this mu st be documented in the source document. Sponsor  may decide to cancel safety assessment on C1D8 and C1D15 if safety data justifies it.  
g Weight/Height: Height is required at baseline only. Weight is required at Screening and prior to starting each infusion.  The total dose will be calculated based on the weight on the day of the infusion or the most 
recent weight assuming it was assessed in a re asonable time frame according to Investigator assessment. Study sites should make every effort to measure body weigh t as close to the infusion day as possible 
considering the variability of local process from site to site.  If the infusion is prepared with the most recent weight assessed in a reasonable time frame, this will not prevent to assess the weight on D1 of each  
cycle.

Section  10.2 and Section  10.7 of the master protocol).  
i Urinalysis using dipstick for glucose, blood, pH, protein, ketones, leukocytes and microscopic examination (if blood or prote in is abnormal), will be performed every 4 cycles during Treatment Period and as 
clinically indicated.  
j Endocrine function tests will be performed every 2 cycles throughout the entire treatment period and at EOT. During the Observat ion Period, they will be performed at Follow -Up Visit 1. They can also be performed 
as clinically indicated   
k Only for pa rticipants who will participate in the intensive PK sample collection.  
l AE/SAE assessment: Severity will be graded according to NCI -CTCAE v 5.0. ICANS and CRS will be graded using ASTCT criteria integrated with central laboratory cytokine results ( 1).   
m If a tumor biopsy was obtained from a target lesion during eligibility assessment, it is preferred to obtain a new baseline s can.  
n Will not be done for participants enrolled in China . 
o Brain imaging: For participants with no  previous history of brain metastases, screening brain imaging will need to be obtained. MRI is the preferred imaging modality  however CT is acceptable if an MRI is clinically 
contraindicated. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases (ie, no neurologica l symptoms, no requirements for corticosteroids, and no lesion >1.5 cm) may participate but will require regular imaging of t he brain 
as a site of disease as per protocol tumor assessment (TA) schedule. In all other cases, the lesions must be treated. Two additional scans, obtained at least 4 weeks apart, should be obtained to document disease 
stability after local treatment administration to the brain metastases has been completed. If participants receive therapy du ring these 4 weeks stabilization at the t reating physician's discretion, it will be considered 
as part of prior anti -cancer therapy. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable, which is defi ned as lack of progression on two sets of imaging obtai ned at least 
[ADDRESS_12593] 14 days prior to study treatment. The screening brain scan may be collected up to 42 days prior to enrollment.

This study  is developed as a master protocol in order to accelerate the investigation of 
SAR444245 with various anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13014] . The 
information that is common to all cohorts  is included in the master protocol, and this substudy 
provides details specific to cohort s with advanced unresectable or metastatic GC or Siewert Type 
2 & 3 GEJ  for the combination therapy with pembrolizumab.  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Preclinical studies demonstrat ed that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and NHP models while  anti programmed cell death -1 (anti-PD1) antibody 
prevents T cell suppression through the PD1/PD -L1 pathway. The combination of anti -PD1 
treatment with SAR444245 was tested in a syngeneic mouse CT -26 colon cancer model and 
induced enhanced anti -tumor activity as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13206] -
free surviving animals compared to each agent in monotherapy. These data support evaluat ion of 
SAR444245 in combination with pembrolizumab.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
2.2.1  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the PD1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD-L1 and 
programmed cell death ligand 2  (PD-L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has 
high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable 
preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development a s an IV immunotherapy for advanced 
malignancies. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across 
a number of indications.  
Refer to the country approved labeling for detailed background information on pembrolizumab.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmaceutical  and therapeutic background   
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades (2). Accumulating evidence shows a correlati on 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL s) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular 
carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and RCC. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded 
ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as 
melanoma  (3, 4).

[ADDRESS_12595] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207]. The normal function of PD1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. P D1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily 
member related to cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
protein 4 (CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) (5, 6). 
The structure of murine PD1 has been resolved (7). PD1 and i ts family members are Type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable -type (IgV type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD1 contains 2 tyros ine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following 
T-cell stimulation, PD1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP -2, to the 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based sw itch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta 
(PKCθ), and zeta -chain -associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell 
signaling cascade (6, 8, 9, 10). The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]1 down -modulates T cell resp onses is 
similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13015] (11, 12).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-clinical trials   
Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking 
PD1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads 
to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with othe r treatment modalities 
(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19). Anti -mouse PD1 or anti -mouse PD -L1 antibodies have demonstrated 
antitumor responses in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreat ic carcinoma, melanoma, 
acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal carcinoma (7, 16, 18, 19, 20). In such studies, tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and increased IFN -γ, granzyme B and perforin expression were 
observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activi ty of PD1 checkpoint 
inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo (18). 
Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy of anti -mouse PD1 antibody as a monotherapy,  
as well as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models 
(see pembrolizumab IB).  
A summary of clinical trial data and the justification of the choice of pembrolizumab dose is 
provided in Section  4.3.2 . 
2.2.2   Rationale for GC/GEJ and selected populations (Cohorts B1, B2 and B3)   
Gastric cancer (GC) is an important health problem, being the 5th most common cancer and the 
3rd leading cause of cancer death worldwide. I n 2018, over 1 million new cases of GC (5.7% 
among all cancer cases diagnosed) were diagnosed with an estimated 782  685 deaths related to 
GC. It accounts for 8.2% of all deaths from cancers in 2018 (21). In th e [LOCATION_002], 27  600 new 
cases of GC and 11,010 related death are estimated in 2020 (22). Eastern Asia is a high -risk area

[ADDRESS_12596] (after lung and liver cancers) (21). The GEJ is anatomically separated from 
GC, but their pathological types, molecular types, genetic variations, and therapeutic approaches 
are similar  (23). First -line chemotherapy most commonly comprises platinum and 
fluoropyrimidine, which extends overall survival ( OS) by [CONTACT_3450] 6.7 months  (23). Disease 
progression after 1L chemotherapy is common and 2L treatment options include docetaxel, 
paclitaxel, irinotecan as a single agent or in combination therapy.  In addition, trastuzumab for 
patients with HER -2 positive disease and anti -VEGFR2 monoclon al antibody ramucirumab are 
also approved as 2L therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Pembrolizumab, was approved by [CONTACT_13229] 2017 for its use in 
advanced, recurrent GC expressing PD -L1 (CPS ≥1), after two prior lines of treatment, which was 
based on ORR from the phase II KEYNOTE -059 clinical trial (24). The phase II trial ONO4538 
and phase III trial ATTRACTION -2 revealed that nivolumab administration to heavily pre -treated 
GC patients is associated with improved OS, compared to patients t reated with placebo (25). 
These results led to the approval of nivolumab in Japan for the treatment of advanced  stage GC 
patients progressing after standard systemic cytotoxic therapy, regardless of the PD -L1 status. In 
this study, PDL1 expression in tumor cells was documented only retrospectively using TPS. The 
so called combined positive score (CPS), which takes into account the PD -L1 positivity on cancer 
and infiltrating immune cells, has been shown to be a better scoring method than the percentage of 
PD-L1+ tumor. In the 2L KEYNOTE -061 trial, treatment with pembrolizumab failed to show 
a significant survival benefit when compared to paclitaxel, however, patients with higher PD -L1 
levels by [CONTACT_13230] a trend  towards better survival (26). Indeed, the overall survival of GC 
patients treated with pembrolizumab was longer than that of patients under chemotherapy in 
CPS ≥10, which could not be recapi[INVESTIGATOR_13042] a CPS  ≥1. There were similar findings in the 
KEYNOTE -062 randomized trial in the 1L setting, where only patients with CPS ≥1 disease were 
randomized to receive either pembrolizumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, or 
chemotherapy alone. (pembrolizumab  ± chemo versus chemotherapy). In this trial, neither the 
pembrolizumab alone nor pembrolizumab combined with chemo improved OS in the CPS ≥[ADDRESS_12597] outcome in terms of ORR (15%) and 
progression -free survival (PFS) (2 months) when compared to chemo alone (ORR 37% and PFS 
6.4 months). Ho wever, in patients with tumors having a C PS ≥10, pembrolizumab alone (and not 
pembrolizumab with chemotherapy) was associated with an impressive OS (median OS, 
17.4 months [HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49 -0.97]) which unfortunately had no α attributed and thus 
could not be considered a statistically signi ficant result (27). As both KEYNOTE -061 and 
KEYNOTE -062 were negative studies, pembrolizumab is therefore not approved in the 1 & 2L 
settings but remained approved after two prior lines of treatment in CPS ≥1 . 
Very recently, the positive results of two randomized trial for nivolumab combined with 
oxaliplatin -based chemotherapy regimens in the 1L setting were disclosed.  The CheckMate -649 
trial enrolled GC/GEJC/EAC patients regardless of CPS with a primary endp oint for OS in the 
CPS≥5 (28). The study demonstrated superior OS (14.4 versus 11.1 months , HR 0.71; p<0.0001)  
with 29% reduction in risk of death,  and a 3.3 months  improvement in median OS  with nivolumab

Nivolumab plus chemo represents a  new potential 1st line standard treatment for patients with 
advanced GC/GEJ cancers .   
Indeed, in non -MSI-H GC/GEJ cancer, the KEYNOTE and CheckMate studies highlights the 
importance of PD -L1 expression on the response and potential benefit in OS, even in the absence 
of chemotherapy.  Combining SAR444245 with an immune checkpoint inhibit or may allow to 
expand the population of patients who may benefit from an ICI, especially in the context of low or 
no PD -L1 expression.  Cohort B1 and B2 aims to bring evidences that the combination of 
SAR444245 with pembrolizumab can have a meaningful inc rease in the ORR induced by

patients respond to treatment, and some move on to  progression after an initial response. As ICI - 
based treatment moves to earlier line, it will be important to explore alternative treatment to 
rescue this population for whom the prognosis is poor on chemotherapy standard of care in later 
treatment lines.  In Cohort B3, the potential to rescue patients who will have progressed on prior

Risk assessment of SAR444245 when combined with pembrolizumab results from anticipated 
risks for SAR444245 and from the label information for Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), taking into 
account potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13016]. The available safety data for pembrolizumab, along with 
proposed mitigation strategies are summarized below and also provided  in Table  11. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab potentiates T -cell responses, including antitumor responses, through blockade of 
PD1 binding to PD -L1 and PD -L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be 
expressed by [CONTACT_13210] (TME) . 
The use of pembrolizumab may cause  IRRs (drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, 
anaphylactoid reaction, and hypersensitivity . Pembrolizumab use may be associated with  
infections  (pneumonia), bone marrow suppression (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), 
increase in the level of hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, 
alkaline phosphatase), kidney damage (nephritis, acute kidney injury), as well as adverse effects 
on the functioning of nervous system (dizziness, headache, peripheral neuropathy, dysgeusia (very 
common) and lethargy). In combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic drugs, 
pembrolizumab administration is commonly associated with hype rtension and cardiac arrhythmia 
(including atrial fibrillation).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 27 Immune -mediated adverse events are designated as important identified risk s for pembrolizumab 
(30). 
Immune -related adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. Most immune -related adverse reactions occurring during treatment 
with pembrolizumab were reversible and managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroid s and/or supportive care. Immune -related adverse reactions have 
also occurred after the last dose of pembrolizumab. Immune -related adverse reactions affecting 
more than one body system can occur simultaneously.  
Among the  immune -related AEs  (irAEs ) associat ed with pembrolizumab are: immune -related 
pneumonitis, immune -related colitis, immune -related hepatitis, immune -related nephritis, 
immune -related endocrinopathies, immune -related skin adverse reactions and other additional 
clinically significant, immune -related adverse reactions (reported in clinical studies or in 
post-marketing experience): uveitis, arthritis, myositis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, Guillain -Barré 
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, encephalitis, and myelitis.  
Effica cy and safety data for pembrolizumab from patients  ≥75 years are limited. In this 
population, pembrolizumab combination therapy should be used with caution after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.  
Please refer to the country -approved product labeling (eg, United S tates Package Insert [ USPI ], 
Summary of Product Characteristics  [SmPC ]) for pembrolizumab for more detailed information.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAR444245 combined with pembrolizumab  
Combining SAR444245 with pembrolizumab may lead to an increased frequency and/or severity 
of adve rse events ( AEs) related to immune activation or may lead to additional AEs related to 
immune system activation for each substance individually or may cause occurrences of 
qualitatively different AEs. Serious adverse drug reactions reported with agents kno wn to increase 
immune activation include pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, colitis, and hormonal dysfunction  
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
As both substances are biologic agents, the y may have the propensity to induce infusion -related 
reactions that may have higher rate of occurrence and severity when SAR444245 with 
pembrolizumab are used in combination.

SAR444245 potentiated the activity of an anti -PD1 antibody. Combination treatment in animals, 
when compared to respective monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], increased the number of complete responses and 
prolonged survival which was durable as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13232] o f the tumor to grow upon 
re-engraftment on the tumor free animals, indicating the establishment of durable memory T -cell 
population in response to the initial treatment (see SAR444245 IB).  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved in most of the indication s proposed to be tested in this 
study (please refer to Section  2.1 - Study Rationale): ESCC, gastric and gastroesophageal, HCC. 
In gastric cancer and ESCC, the main benefit of pe mbrolizumab is brought to patients with 
diseases that have a relatively high expression of PD -L1 (CPS ≥10). Combining SAR444245 to 
pembrolizumab is anticipated to expand to population responding to the an anti -PD1 and to 
increase the quality of the response. Such effects have been demonstrated in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_12964] -02 study 
for bempegaldesleukin combined wit h nivolumab in metastatic melanoma, achieving deep and 
durable responses with rates of CR of 34% and PFS (30.9 months) exceeding that reported in 
clinical trials for approved treatments (31). Objective respons es were also documented in PDL1 
negative cases (n=13), with an ORR of 39% and 3 patients achieving 100% reduction of target 
lesions, and 2 patients achieving CR. Echoing these results are those of the same combination in 
1L metastatic urothelial carcinoma,  an indication where response to immune checkpoint is linked 
to the level of expression of PD -L1.  In this study, bempegaldesleulin when combined with 
nivolumab induced significant ORR with 17% CR, with ORR similar and PD -L1 negative (50%) 
and PD -L1 positi ve (56%)  (15), which contrast with data from Keynote -052 for pembrolizumab 
(32, 33). Combining SAR444245 with pembr olizumab is anticipated to bring benefit to patients 
with ESCC and GC/GEJ even in the context of  low PD -L1 and could rescue patients who have 
progressed or relapsed following an anti -PD1/PD -L1.

4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
Cohorts B1, B2  and B3 will assess SAR444245 adding on to pembrolizumab in participants wi th 
advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer (GC) or Siewert Type  2 & 3 gastro -esophageal 
junction adenocarcinoma (GEJ) and for whom receiving standard of care (SOC) is not in his or 
her best interest (for example, participants who are not eligibl e, cannot tolerate, decline to receive, 
or have no access to such treatment) or where no SOC is established. MSI -H cases will not be 
eligible. HER2 + cases will not be eligible unless they have progressed on a trastuzumab -based 
treatment.   
•Cohorts B1  & B2 participants must not have received more than two prior lines of
treatment that did not include an anti -PD1/PD -L1-based regimen. Participants will be
assigned to one of these 2 cohorts according to the level of PD -L1 expression at baseline
using the CPS a s follow:
-Cohort B1: participants with CPS ≥1 GC/GEJ
-Cohort B2 : participants with CPS <1 GC/GEJ
•Cohort B3 participants are eligible regardless of the disease CPS status and must have
received at least one and no more than three prior lines of treatment and  have progressed
after primary or secondary resistance to an anti -PD1/PD -L1-based regimen (detailed in
Section  5.1).

4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE  
4.3.1  SAR444245 dose   
Please refer to the master protocol.    
4.3.2  Pembrolizumab dose   
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the 
totality of data generated i n the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is an appropriate 
dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications. As outlined below, this dose is justified 
by: 
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies in melanoma and NSCLC indications 
demonstrating flat dose - and exposure -efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W)  representing an approximate 5 to 7.5 fold exposure range 
(refer to the pembrolizumab IB) . 
• Population PK analysis showing that both fixed dosing and weight -based  dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability with considerable overlap in the distributions of 
exposures, supporting suitability of 200 mg Q3W  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W acros s multiple indications. And  
• Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK [PBPK] analysis) at 
200 mg Q3W.  
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studi es, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with 
melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, 
PD-L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in 
combination with chemothe rapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 
10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of 
these studies demonstrated  flat dose - and exposure -response relationships across the doses studied 
representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 - fold difference in exposure. The  2 mg/kg (or 200 mg 
fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat 
dose-exposure -response relationships were also observed in other tumor types including head and 
neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 
[ADDRESS_12604] binding to cancer cells.

[ADDRESS_12605], PK data in 
KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated 
saturation of PD1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than [ADDRESS_12606] tumor PD1 saturation over a wide range of tumo r 
penetration and PD1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W 
achieves full PD1 saturation in both blood and tumor.  
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body 
weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported  by 
[CONTACT_13212] -dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity 
and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was selected for evaluation 
across all pembrolizumab protocols.

Primary resistance  is defined as a patient who has experienced progressive disease (PD) or SD 
lasting <6 months of initiation of PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitor -based treatment and who received at least 
6 weeks of the PD1/PD -L1. Radiographic confirmation of the PD must be documented after 
a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial identification of progression, unless: i) investigator 
confirms clinical progression/ deterioration attributed to PD, or ii) the fi rst radiographic 
assessment indicated critical tumor growth by [CONTACT_9661] (size or location).   
Or 
Secondary resistance : patients must have experienced PD, either during or within 3 months of 
discontinuing treatment with anti -PD1-based therapy, occurring afte r previous clear benefit (any 
complete [CR] or partial response [PR]), or after previous stable disease (SD) >6 months. 
No requirement for radiographic confirmation of progression.  
I 09. An anti -PD1/PD -L1 containing regimen is defined as either an anti -PD1/PD -L1 
monotherapy, or an anti -PD1/PD -L1 agent administered in the same cycle as another 
systemic anticancer therapy. If PD1/PD -L1 was used beyond initial radiological 
progression while continuing to use the same PD1/PD -L1 agent used before PD, it  is still

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 39 • Cycle may be delayed  for situations other than TEAEs such as medical/surgical events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy. Participants should be placed back on study 
therapy within 21 days of the scheduled delay , unless otherwise discusse d with the 
Sponsor (for example for national or regional emergencies). The reason for the delay 
should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
6.5.3  General guidelines for the management of treatment -related adverse events   
Participants  who experience G rade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the study (including clinically 
significant Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities as defined in Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol ) 
not listed in  Section  6.5.4  (Tables  3-8) will be required to temporarily delay the IMP. After cycle 
delay, such participants may be considered  for treatment resumption once the TRAE resolves or 
improves to Grade 1 or baseline .  
The dose of SAR444245 should be reduced to μg/kg (with the exception of lymphocytopenia 
which is directly associated with SAR444245 mode -of-action and does not require dose 
reduction) in cases of:  
• First occurrence of Grade 3 TRAE that does not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within 
72 hours, and second occurrence o f Grade 3 TRAE of any duration.  
• Grade 4 TRAE . 
• First occurrence of Grade 3 laboratory abnormality that are clinically significant per 
Section 10.3.1 of  the master protocol . and that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within 
72 hours, and second occurrenc e of Grade 3 clinically significant laboratory abnormality 
of any duration.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_12618] scheduled dose.  
The cycle delay of treatment for Grade 2  events  is left at the discretion of the Investigator unless 
otherwise specified  in this protocol.   
No cycle delay of treatment or dose modification is required for Grade 1  events.  
The final decision on dose modification and/or corrective therapy will be based on the 
Investigator’s judgmen t, in the best interest of the participant.  
Recommended guidelines for the management of specific adverse events including irAE, CRS, 
Vascular Leak Syndrome (VLS ) and Infusion -related reactions ( IRR) are presented in 
Section  6.5.4 .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -relate d reactions (I RR)  
Participants should routinely receive premedication as detailed in Section 6.1.2 .1 of the master 
protocol prior to SAR444245 administration, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of 
IRRs.  
An infu sion-related reaction in this study is defined as any signs or symptoms which develop 
during the infusion or up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion. The term IRR indicates 
only a specific temporal relationship with the infusion and does not sp ecify a particular 
mechanism underlying the signs or symptoms.   
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening infusion -reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug 
infusion  and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. Dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines on pembrolizumab -associated infusion reaction 
are provided in Table  3. 
After an infus ion-related reaction due to pembrolizumab infusion (Grade 3 or Grade 4), the 
SAR444245 infusion will be delayed and can be administered after resolution of symptoms. The 
Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor if the SAR444245 infusi on needs 
to be delayed more than [ADDRESS_12620] the next SAR444245 infusion given at half the i nfusion 
rate. For instructions on premedication at subsequent dosing, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Fever, flu -like symptoms and cytokine -release syndrome (CRS)  
Fever can frequently happen with infusion of IL -2 and may possibly evolve into flu -like 
symptoms or could be  an early manifestation of CRS. Fever or flu -like symptoms should be 
graded according to CTCAE V5.0 and managed according to institutional standards.  
Cytokine -release syndrome should be graded as per American Society for Transplantation and 
Cellular Thera py (ASTCT ) criteria integrated with central laboratory cytokine results, and 
managed per guidelines in Table 5. If any gra de of CRS is suspected, sites should make every 
effort to draw an additional blood sample for cytokines levels (by [CONTACT_12115]) prior to the 
administration of tocilizumab, as well as C -reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin (by [CONTACT_13213]).  
Sites  should have at least 2 full doses of tocilizumab available and access to an intensive care unit 
(ICU ), in case participants develop CRS.  
Guidelines for management of CRS according to severity grading ar e provided in Table 5.

subsequent treatment should be resumed only when symptoms have 
resolved or impro ved to Grade 1.  
SAR444245 can be either restarted at µg/kg or permanently 
discontinued, as clinically indicated.  
If CRS Grade 4, SAR444245 should be permanently discontinued, as 
clinically indicated.  
If CRS Grade 3 or Grade 4, IV corticosteroids shoul d be initiated (outside 
of the context of CAR -T cells, corticosteroids alone maybe initiated in first 
intention)  and tocilizumab considered,  and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027]/or other 
vasopressors should be administered as needed. Participants with severe 
CRS may req uire management in intensive care setting, with monitoring of 
clinical status and laboratory tests performed at least daily.  
As the participant improves, the intensity of the monitoring and setting can 
be decreased, but the participant should not be discha rged from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13048]. Corticosteroids can then be administered 
IV or orally every 8 hours for up to 3 days, then tapered over 4 days. In 
general, tapering of steroids can start when vasopressors and high -flow 
oxygen are no longer needed.  
CRS is considered resolved when there is sustained resolution of fever 
and there is no longer a need for oxygen supplementation to relieve 
hypoxia nor vasopressors to maintain blood pressure; however, 
normalization of temperature alone does not de fine resolution of CRS.  
 If no clinical improvement in oxygenation, hypotension, fever, and other 
CRS manifestations is observed within 24 to 72 hours, management for 
persistent or worsening CRS should be initiated. Re -evaluation for other 
contributing co nditions should be done, such as infection, cardiac, 
thromboembolic and other complications. Intravenous Tocilizumab at 
8 mg/kg (for participants  weighing ≥30 kg) should be administered, and 
steroids should be administered concurrently. If still no improvement in 
oxygenation, hypotension , fever and other manifestations is observed 
after the first dose of tocilizumab, it may be repeated after an inte rval of at 
least 8 hours and should not exceed 4 doses in total.  
For participants with severe CRS who fail to improve after repetitive 
treatment with both tocilizumab and steroids, alternative options should be 
discussed with clinical site specialists  
a Information for preparation and storage of SAR444245 is provided in the pharmacy manual.  
b Fever is defined as temperature ≥38°C not attributable to any other cause. In patients who have CRS then receive antipyretic or anticytokine 
therapy such as tocilizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS severity. In this case , CRS grading is driven by 
[CONTACT_13199]/or hypoxia.  
c CRS grade is determined by [CONTACT_13200]: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, a patient with 
temperature of 39.5°C, hypotension requiring 1 vasopressor, and  hypoxia requiring low -flow nasal cannula is classified as Grade  3 CRS.  
d Low-flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at ≤6 L/minute. Low flow also includes blow -by [CONTACT_13201], sometimes used in 
pediatrics. High -flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at >6 L/minute.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 45 [IP_ADDRESS]  Immune -related adverse events   
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect  more than one body system simultaneously. 
IrAEs are thought to be caused by [CONTACT_13214]. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce 
complications. Based on existing pembrolizumab clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible 
and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids 
and/or other supportive care.  
Investigators must be extremely vigilant and be ready to inter vene early in the management of 
irAEs because the onset of symptoms of irAEs (eg, pneumonitis) may be subtle. For suspected 
irAEs, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm etiology or exclude neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other eti ologic causes. Additional procedures or tests such as 
bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the 
severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab  and/or SAR444245  and 
administer corticos teroids.  
SAR444245 may increase the incidence and severity of these events.  
Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs are provided in Table  6. Of 
note, when study interventions are administered  in combination, if the AE is considered immune -
related, both drugs in the combination should be held according to recommended dose 
modifications.  If a participant experiences several irAEs, the most conservative recommendation 
should be followed.  
The CTC AE V5.[ADDRESS_12622] be used to grade the severity of AEs.  
When pembrolizumab can be restarted, it should be administered at the initial planned dose and 
schedule as no modification is allowed:  
• If the toxicity does not resolve or the criteria for resuming treatme nt are not met, the 
participant must be discontinued from all study drugs.  
If the toxicities do resolve and conditions are aligned with what is defined in Table  6, the 
combination of SAR444245 and  pembrolizumab may  be restarted at the discretion of the 
investigator. In these cases where the toxicity is attributed to the combination or to 
SAR444245 alone, re -initiation of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy may be considered 
after communication with the Sponsor.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)  
Immune cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome is a neuropsychiatric synd rome which is frequently 
associated with CRS; however, it is specifically excluded from the definition of CRS and can occur 
during the course of CRS, after its resolution, or independently from CRS. Clinical findings can be 
progressive and may include apha sia, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, 
motor weakness, seizure, and cerebral edema. Severity is evaluated using the ASTCT Consensus 
grading scale, with ICE score for encephalopathy assessment ( Section 10.1 1 of the master proto col). 
Recommendations for  ICANS  management mainly include the use of steroids, whereas tocilizumab 
should only be used in the context of CRS, as outlined in Table 7. The proposed management should 
be considered only as recommendations and in light of recommendations from site specialist.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Vascular leak syndrome (VLS)   
Vascular leak syndrome is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_13234]. This syndrome 
is observed in patients who demonstrate a state of generalized leaky capi[INVESTIGATOR_13032], low -flow states, ischemia -reperfusi on injuries, toxemias, medications, or poisoning. 
In various human diseases, an increase in capi[INVESTIGATOR_13033] -rich fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space manifested by [CONTACT_13219]: diffuse pi[INVESTIGATOR_13034], exudative serous cavity effusions, 
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, and, in some cases, hypovolemic shock with 
multiple -organ failure.  Fluid management is the cornerstone of VLS management; it is a bala nce 
between maintaining the intravascular volume to ensure organ perfusion to prevent organ failure, 
while avoiding volume overload. The management of VLS according to severity grading is 
described in Table 8. These  guidelines are not comprehensive and the Investigator should exercise 
clinical judgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual participant and refer to 
current guidelines to the topic ( 1).

Symptomatic; medical intervention indicated  SAR444245  should be delayed. Upon resolution of VLS or improvement to 
Grade  1, SAR444245a can be resumed at the reduced dose  of  µg/kg.  
The initial strategy is to administer boluses of crystalloids with a goal of 
providing the minimum effective volume that optimizes blood pressure

volume expan sion.

Grade 3:  
Severe symptoms; intervention indicated  
Grade 4:  
Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated  If Grade 3 or Grade 4 VLS, SAR444245 should be permanently 
discontinued.   
In participants  with severe shock, blood pressure may be only partially 
responsive or refractory to IV crystalloid fluids.  
Severe or persistent hypotension is to be managed by [CONTACT_13220]. A trial of 25% albumin IV is an additional option, although its 
efficac y is limited to those with a severe capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946]. In those who remain 
with refractory shock in the setting of low filling pressures, high molecular 
weight starches such as hetastarch (MW 450 kDa) and pentastarch (MW 
264 kDa) may be effective in expanding  the intravascular volume. 
Supportive care with invasive and noninvasive ventilation as well as renal 
replacement may be necessary in severe cases. When available, disease -
specific therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to facilitate 
recovery.  
During the recovery phase from severe capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], the endothelial injury 
resolves and the capi[INVESTIGATOR_13035], resulting in 
stabilization of blood pressure, at which time fluid overload symptoms and 
signs may predominate (eg, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], systemic edema, ascites). Volume removal 
with loop diuretics is the first -line therapy in these patients. In those with 
marginal blood pressure and fluid overload, the combination of loop 
diure tics and 25% albumin IV may facilitate volume removal. Patients with 
AKI refractory to diuretics will require renal replacement.

[ADDRESS_12643] their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small ( eg, 2 mm). If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13051], t he measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned. For lesions which fragment/split add together the longest diameters of the fragment ed 
portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure the maximal longest diameter for the “merged 
lesion.”  
Clinical Lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥10 mm as assessed using calipers ( eg, skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion i s 
recommended. If feasible, imaging is preferred.  
Chest X -Ray. Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions  ≥[ADDRESS_12644] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also accept able in certain situations ( eg, for body scans). Other specialized imaging or 
other techniques may also be appropriate for individual case. For example, while PET scans are 
not considered adequate to measure lesions, PET -CT scans may be used providing that  the 
measures are obtained from the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast).  
Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as 
a method of measureme nt. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], 
confirmation by [CONTACT_13222].  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm co mplete pathological response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor Markers.  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor respons e. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in CR.

cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for exa mple, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be 
a potential adverse effect of treatment ( eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytol ogical confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable

The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly before the Table of Contents (TOC).  
10.14.1  Amended protocol 01 ([ADDRESS_12645]  2021 ) 
This amend ed protocol (Amendment 01) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The overall rationale for the amendment is to include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13052] , update the rules 
for dose modification in case of treatment -related adverse events (TRAEs) , and clarify the 
population for Cohort s B1, B2 and B3 in substudy 02 .

and Section 4.1 Study 
design  The following sentence has been added “ for 
example, participants who are not eligible, cannot 
tolerate, decline to receive, or have no acc ess to 
such treatment ” to clarify the population for Cohort 
B1, B2, and B3.  For clarity.  
Section 1.[ADDRESS_12646] been 
added as footnote

based therapy) ”. 
Section 5.1 Inclusion 
Criteria  In I06,  “ - less than required number of slides or 
archival tumor tissue sample collec ted more than 
6 months prior to screening” has been revised to 
“-less than required number of slides or archival 
tumor tissue sample collected more than 6 months 
prior to enrollment ”. Harmonization per program level approach . 
Section 6.5.1 General 
rules  The following sentence has been deleted “ Once 
a dose has been decreased, intra -patient 
re-escalation back to the previous dose level is 
not permitted. ”, and the following sentences have 
been added “ In participants who have SAR444245 
dose reduction due to SA R444245 related Grade 
≥3 TRAEs, SAR444245 dose may be 
re-escalated to  μg/kg if: •no SAR444245 
related Grade ≥[ADDRESS_12647] 
2 subsequent cycles, AND •both Investigator and 
Sponsor agree that the p articipant has clinical 
benefit. ”. For clarification of how dose will be reduced  
and re -escalated for participants who 
experience any Grade ≥3 TRAEs . 
Section 6.5.3 General 
guidelines for the 
management of 
treatment -related 
adverse events  The following sen tence “Participants who 
experience Grade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the 
study (including clinically significant Grade 3 
laboratory abnormalities as defined in Section 
10.3.1 of the master protocol) will be required to 
temporarily delay the IMP, unless specifi ed 
otherwise in the protocol, and with the exception 
of the TRAEs resolving within 5 days. After cycle 
delay, such participants may be considered for 
treatment resumption once the TRAE resolves or 
improves to Grade 1 or baseline or is stable and 
manageable  through supportive/medical therapy.” 
has been changed to “Participants who 
experience Grade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the 
study (including clinically significant Grade 3 
laboratory abnormalities as defined in Section 
10.3.1 of the master protocol) not listed in Section 
6.5.4 (Tables 3 -8) will be required to temporarily 
delay the IMP . After cycle de lay, such participants 
may be considered for treatment resumption once 
the TRAE resolves or improves to Grade 1 or 
baseline”.  
Dose reduction rules have added, and the 
following sentence has been deleted “ Dose 
reduction for SAR444245 from  µg/kg to 
 µg/kg (or another lower recommended dose) 
may be decided when specified in the protocol or 
following discussions with the Sponsor. ” . For consistency and clarity.

“prematu rely” has been removed from 
“prematurely permanently discontinued”.  For clarity.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Fever, 
flu-like symptoms and 
cytokine -release 
syndrome (CRS)  In Table 5 under Grade 3, the following sentence 
was deleted “If subsequent administration is 
tolerated, increasing the SAR444245 dose to 
 µg/kg at subsequent administration can be 
considered based on the clinical judgement of the 
Investigator with the Sponsor”.  For consistency.  
Section 9.[ADDRESS_12648] been added “ For 
each cohort, if the predictive probability of 
concluding a minimum clinical meaningful effect of 
the study treatment (ORR of 15% for cohort B1, 
5% for cohort B2, 10% for cohort B3) at the end of 
study is <15%, the corresponding cohort will be 
stopped f or futility. To facilitate the calculation of 
predictive probability, a minimum informative prior 
of Beta (0.5, 0.5) is used at the time of the design 
of the study. However, emerging data generated 
from outside of the study may warrant a different 
prior to  be considered before this interim 
analysis. ”. To include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13052] .

Please refer to the Master Protocol for description of common protocol elements. Cohort -specific 
protocol elements are described below.  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol title:   
A Phase  2 non -randomized, open -label, multi -cohort, multi -center study assessing the clinical 
benefit of SAR444245 (THOR -707) combined with pembrolizumab for the treatment of 
participants with advanced and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma  
Brief  title:  A study of SAR444245 combined with pembrolizumab  for the treatment of 
participants with hepatocell ular carcinoma  
Rationale:  
Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and non-human primate  (NHP ) models while anti -PD1 antibody prevents 
T cell suppression through the programmed cell death -1/programmed cell death -ligand 1 
(PD1 /PD-L1) pathway. The combination of anti -PD1 treatment with SAR444245 was tested in the 
syngeneic murine CT -26 colon cancer model and induced enhanced anti -tumor activity as 
demonstrated b y an increased number of complete responses (CR ) and tumor -free surviving 
animals compared to each agent in monotherapy. These data support evaluation of SAR444245 in 
combination with an anti -PD1 antibody . 
PD1/PD -L1-based regimens have been approved as 1L or 2L therapy for advanced unresectable or 
metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Rescue of patients who will have failed 
ICI-containing regimens is crucial for later line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  This proposed study aims to establish 
proof -of-concept that combining the no n-alpha -IL2 SAR444245 with the anti -PD1 antibody 
pembrolizumab will result in a significant increase in the percentage of patients experiencing an 
objective response in participant s with advanced u nresectable or metastatic HCC  who relapsed on 
prior PD1/PD -L1-based regimens .

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 11 Brief summary :  
Cohort C  will assess SAR444245 adding on to pembrolizumab in participants with advanced 
unresectable or metastatic HCC  who relapsed on prior PD1/PD -L1-based regimens, with at least 
SD as best response and with no more than 2 prior lines of treatment.

Number of participants:  
Overall, approximately 40 participants will be enrolled and treated in Cohort  C. 
Intervention  groups and duration:  
Please refer to the master protocol for common descr iption of the study duration for a participant 
in Cohort  C. For treatment period, the completion of Cycle 35 is applicable for Cohort C .  
Study intervention(s)  
Dosing sequence:
Investigational medicinal products  
Pembrolizumab  
• Formulation : Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) as 100 mg/4 mL (25 mg/mL) sol ution in 
single -dose vials  
• Route of administration : intravenous (IV) infusion.  
• Dose regimen : Pembrolizumab will be administered as a dose of 200 mg using 
a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3 -week treatment cycle for up to 35 cycles . 
Study sites shoul d make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window 
between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 
30 minutes -5 min/+10  min).

There is no n eed to perform Cycle [ADDRESS_12679] be performed, and results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator prior to IMP administration 
at that visit. After Cycle 1, samples for laboratory assessments (excluding PK & biomarker)  can be collected up to [ADDRESS_12680] IMP administration in which study procedures used to support 
eligibility are done.  
b Cycle: a treatment cycle is [ADDRESS_12681] ration. If treatment cycles are adjusted, all procedures except tumor assessment imaging will be completed according to the c ycle 
number. Tumor assessment imaging will be performed at fixed time points from C1D1 regardless of any treatment delays.  
c Observat ion Period: Participants who enter the Observation period will be followed differently depending on the reason leading to per manent IMP discontinuation. See Section  4.1 For parti cipant's convenience, all 
Follow -up assessments may occur during the same visit as that when tumor assessment is performed.  
d Survival Phone Call Follow -Up Period: Once the participant stops the tumor assessments due to PD or starts a new antineoplastic ther apy, the participant moves into the Survival Follow -up Period and should be 
contact[CONTACT_13110] 3 months ±14 days to assess for survival status. Updated survival status may be re quested by [CONTACT_13111].  
e For Cycle 4 visits, please refer to PK flowchart in  Section  1.5. 
f C1D8 and/or C1D15 visits must be performed on site for the following participants only: 1) Participants scheduled t o have blood draws for biomarker assessment and/or ADA on Day 8; 2) Participants who will 
receive IMP on Day 8 and Day 15. For all other participants, these 2 on -site visits may be done remotely as appropriate based on investigator’s discretion per institu tional standard and local regulations. If this is 
the case, this must be documented in the source document. Sponsor may decide to cancel safety assessment on C1D8 and C1D15 if  safety data justifies it.  
g Weight/Height: Height is required at baseline only. W eight is required at Scre ening and prior to starting each infusion. The total dose will be calculated based on the weight on the day of the infusion o r the most 
recent weight assuming it was assessed in a reasonable time frame according to Investigator ass essment. Study sites should make every effort to measure body weight as close to the infusion day as possible 
considering the variability of local process from site to site.  If the infusion is prepared with the most recent weight assessed in a reasonable t ime frame, this will not prevent to assess the weight on D1 of each 
cycle.  
h For participants with known HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection under antiviral treatment to confirm controlled infect ion, and for all participants in [LOCATION_013] and Italy (see details and specific instructions in 
Section 10.2 and Section 10.7 of the  master protocol).  
i Urinalysis using dipstick for glucose, blood, pH, protein, ketones, leukocytes and microscopic examination (if blood or prote in is abnormal), will be performed ever y 4 cycles during Treatment Period and as 
clinically indicated.  
j Endocrine function tests will be performed every 2 cycles throughout the entire treatment period and at EOT. During the Obser vation Period, they will be performed at Follow -Up Visit 1. They ca n also be performed 
as clinically indicated  
k Only for participants who will participate in the intensive PK sample collection.  
l AE/SAE assessment: Severity will be graded according to NCI -CTCAE v 5.0. ICANS and CRS will be graded using ASTCT criteria integr ated with central laboratory cytokine results ( 1).  
m If a tumor biopsy was obtained from a target lesion during eligibility assessment, it is preferred to obtain a new baseline s can.  
n Will not be done for parti cipants enrolled in China . 
o Brain imaging: For participants with no previous history of brain metastases, screening brain imaging will need to be obtaine d. MRI is the preferred imaging modality however CT is acceptable if an MRI is clinically 
contraindicate d. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases (ie, no neurological symptoms, no requirements for corticosteroids, and no les ion >1.5 cm) may participate but will require regular imaging of the brain 
as a site of disease as per protocol tumor assessment (T A) schedule. In all other cases, the lesions must be treated. Two additional scans, obtained at least 4 weeks apart, should b e obtained to document disease 
stability after local treatment administration to the brain metastases has been completed. If partic ipants receive therapy during these 4 weeks stabilization at the treating physician's discretion, it will be considered 
as part of prior anti -cancer therapy. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable, wh ich is defined as lack of progression on two sets of imaging obtained at least 
[ADDRESS_12682]  14 days prior to study treatment. The screening brain scan may be collected up to 42 days prior to enrollment.

This study  is developed as a master protocol in order to accelerate the investigation of 
SAR444245 with various anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13054] . The 
information that is common to all cohorts is included in the master protocol, and this substudy 
provides details specific to cohort with advanced unresectable or metastatic HCC for the 
combination therapy with pembrolizuma b. 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and NHP models while anti -PD1 antibody prevents T cell suppression 
through the PD1/PD -L1 pathway. The combination of a nti-PD1 treatment with SAR444245 was 
tested in a syngeneic mouse CT -26 colon cancer model and induced enhanced anti -tumor activity 
as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13206] -free surviving animals compared to 
each agent in monotherapy. These da ta support evaluation of SAR444245 in combination with 
pembrolizumab.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
2.2.1  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the PD1 receptor, thus inhibiting its  interaction with PD -L1 and 
programmed cell death ligand 2  (PD-L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has 
high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable 
preclinical safety profile and is in clin ical development as an IV immunotherapy for advanced 
malignancies. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across 
a number of indications.  
Refer to the country approved labeling for detailed background information on pembrolizum ab. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmaceutical and therapeutic background   
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades (2). Accumulating evidence  shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL s) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio o f CD8+ effector 
T cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular 
carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and RCC. Tumor -infiltr ating lymphocytes can be expanded 
ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as 
melanoma  (3, 4).

Version number:   
[ADDRESS_12685] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207]. The normal function of PD1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoi mmune reactions. PD1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily 
member related to cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
protein 4 (CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen recept or signaling upon 
engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) (5, 6). 
The structure of murine PD1 has been resolved (7). PD1 and its family members are Type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable -type (IgV type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD 1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following 
T-cell stimulation, PD1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP -2, to the 
immunoreceptor  tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta 
(PKCθ), and zeta -chain -associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell 
signaling cascade (6, 8, 9, 10). The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]1 down -modulates T cell responses is 
similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13015] (11, 12). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-clinical trials   
Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking 
PD1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads 
to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in comb ination with other treatment modalities 
(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19). Anti -mouse PD1 or anti -mouse PD -L1 antibodies have demonstrated 
antitumor responses in models of squamous cell ca rcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, 
acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal carcinoma (7, 16, 18, 19, 20). In such studies, tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and increased IFN -γ, granzyme B and perforin expression were 
observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the  antitumor activity of PD1 checkpoint 
inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo (18). 
Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy of anti -mouse PD1 antibody as a monotherapy, 
as well as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models 
(see pembrolizumab IB).  
A summary of clinical trial data and the justification of the choice of pembrolizumab dose is 
provided in Section  4.3.2 .  
2.2.2  Rationale for HCC and selected population (Cohort C)   
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for the majority of primary liver cancers. Worldwide, 
liver cancers are the 4th most common cause o f cancer -related death and rank 6th in terms of 
incident cases (21). In Asia the global burden of HCC is declining, it is still increasing in the US 
and Europe (22). Liver cancer is the second most lethal tumor. More than half of patients present 
with advanced -stage tumor and ultimately receive palliative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 25 Up to recently, sorafenib has been the mainstay of 1L HCC treatment. Several tyrosine kinase 
inhibi tors ( TKIs ) have become available in the last few years. Lenvatinib was approved as 1L 
treatment for HCC in [ADDRESS_12686] drug approved by [CONTACT_13236] -line tre atment because it 
decreased the death risk by 37% as compared to the placebo ( 23). Cabozantinib and ramucirumab 
also received FDA approval as second -line treatment because of promising efficacy and 
manageable safety profile based on two RCTs (CELESTIAL and REACH -2) (24, 25). In this 
setting, the TKI are the current treatment options but inducing limited response rates (~4 -7%).  
Otherwise, HCC is characterized by [CONTACT_13237], with a complex array of immune cells 
populating the tumor microenvironment that are inactivated by [CONTACT_13238] -suppressive 
signals  (26), it is wh y Immunotherapy has become a promising therapeutic approach for HCC. 
The FDA has granted accelerated approval for nivolumab and pembrolizumab monotherapy for 
patients with HCC who have been previously been treated with sorafenib based on two studies 
(Check Mate -040 and KEYNOTE -224) ( 27, 1). Although ICI monotherapy had achieved clinically 
meaningful ORRs, these ORRs are still modest (15 -18%) and did not translate in to survival 
benefit. In the Phase 3 trial of KEYNOTE -240, despi[INVESTIGATOR_13055] 18.3% as achieved for 
pembrolizumab vs. 4.4% for placebo, pembrolizumab versus placebo failed to demonstrate 
significant improvements in overall survival ( OS) or overall survival ( PFS) as these primary 
endpoints did not reach statistical significance per prespecified criteria ( 28). Furthermore, 
nivolumab monotherapy failed to achieve a significant primary endpoint (OS) as the 1L treatme nt 
of HCC (CheckMate 459).  
Efforts have intensified to develop strategies to enhance the immune response and overall efficacy 
of ICIs, including combination regimens with agents that target pathways involved in tumor 
progression and process immunomodulato ry properties ( 29) and these led to further investigations 
of combinations of immunotherapy with other modalities to increase durable responses and 
survival. Nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Phase 1/2 Check Mate -040) received accelerated 
approval because of promising ORR (32%) and durable responses (at least 24 months over 30% 
of responders) in the early Phase 1/2 CheckMate -040 ( 30).  
More recently, FDA approved atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab as the new SoC in 
1L based on the data from Phase -[ADDRESS_12687] (IMbrave150) where a significant improvement in both 
OS and PFS was observed in the atezolizumab -bevacizumab arm compared to the sorafenib arm 
(OS: NE versus 13.2 months; PFS: 6.8 versus  4.3 months) (29).  
In summary, TKIs are main treatment options in this population, inducing very limited ORR 
(~5%). ICI -based regimen (atezolizumab + bevacizumab) has become the  new SoC in 1L, 
therefore, most patients will have received an ICI before later line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Rescue of patients 
who will have failed ICI -containing regimen in 1L will be evaluated to establish PoC of 
SAR444245 when combined with pembrolizumab in 2L+ HCC .

common)  and lethargy). In combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic drugs, 
pembrolizumab administration is commonly associated with hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia 
(including atrial fibrillation).  
Immune -mediated adverse events are designated as importa nt identified risk s for pembrolizumab 
(31). 
Immune -related adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. Most immune -related adverse reactions occurrin g during treatment 
with pembrolizumab were reversible and managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune -related adverse reactions have 
also occurred after the last dose of pembrolizumab. Immun e-related adverse reactions affecting 
more than one body system can occur simultaneously.  
Among the immune -related AEs ( irAEs ) associated with pembrolizumab are: immune -related 
pneumonitis, immune -related colitis, immune -related hepatitis, immune -related n ephritis, 
immune -related endocrinopathies, immune -related skin adverse reactions and other additional 
clinically significant, immune -related adverse reactions (reported in clinical studies or in 
post-marketing experience): uveitis, arthritis, myositis, myo carditis, pancreatitis, Guillain -Barré 
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, encephalitis, and myelitis.

[IP_ADDRESS]  SAR444245 combined with pembrolizumab  
Combining SAR444245 with pembrolizumab may lead to an increased frequency and/or severity 
of adverse events ( AEs) related to immune activation or may lead to additional  AEs related to 
immune system activation for each substance individually or may cause occurrences of 
qualitatively different AEs. Serious adverse drug reactions reported with agents known to increase 
immune activation include pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephri tis, colitis, and hormonal dysfunction  
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
As both substances are biologic agents, they may have the propensity to induce infusion -related 
reactions that may have higher rate of occurrence and severity when SAR444245 with 
pembrolizumab are used in combination.  
The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of SAR444245 combined with the approved dosing of the 
anti PD -[ADDRESS_12689] -26, relatively resistant to immune checkpoint treatment, 
SAR444245 potentiated the activity of an anti -PD1 antibody. Combinati on treatment in animals, 
when compared to respective monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], increased the number of complete responses and 
prolonged survival which was durable as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13211]-engraftment on the tumor free animals, indic ating the establishment of durable memory T -cell 
population in response to the initial treatment (see SAR444245 IB).  
2.3.3  Overall benefit: risk conclusion  
More detailed information about the expected benefits of SAR444245 may be found in the master 
protocol.  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants in this study, the potential 
risks identified in association with this new generation IL -2 SAR444245 combined with the 
anti-PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab are justified by [CONTACT_13239] b enefits that may be afforded to

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 31 4.3.2  Pembrolizumab dose   
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the 
totality of data generated in the Keytruda devel opment program, 200 mg Q3W is an appropriate 
dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications. As outlined below, this dose is justified 
by: 
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies in melanoma and NSCLC indications 
demonstrating flat dose - and expos ure-efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W)  representing an approximate 5 to  7.5 fold exposure range 
(refer to the pembrolizumab IB) . 
• Population PK analysis showing that both fixed dosing and weight -based dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability with considerable overlap in the distributions of 
exposures, supporting suitability of 200 mg Q3W  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indicatio ns. And  
• Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK [PBPK] analysis) at 
200 mg Q3W.  
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with 
melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, 
PD-L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 
10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of 
these studies demonstrated flat dose - and expo sure-response relationships across the doses studied 
representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 - fold difference in exposure. The  2 mg/kg (or 200 mg 
fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat 
dose-exposure -respon se relationships were also observed in other tumor types including head and 
neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 
[ADDRESS_12693], PK data in 
KN001 evaluating targ et-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated 
saturation of PD1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than [ADDRESS_12694] tumor PD1 saturation over a wide range of tumor 
penetration and PD 1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W 
achieves full PD1 saturation in both blood and tumor.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 32 Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body 
weight and other participant covariat es on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by 
[CONTACT_13240] -dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity 
and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was selected for evaluation

should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
6.5.3  General guidelines for the management of treatment -related adverse e vents   
Participants  who experience Grade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the study (including clinically 
significant Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities as defined in Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol ) 
not listed in Section  6.5.4  (Tables 3 -8) will be required to temporarily delay the IMP. After cycle 
delay, such participants may be considered  for treatment resumption once the TRAE resolves or 
improves to Grade 1 or baseline .  
The dose of  SAR444245 shoul d be reduced to  μg/kg (with the exception of lymphocytopenia 
which is directly associated with SAR444245 mode -of-action and does not require dose 
reduction) in cases of:  
• First occurrence of Grade 3 TRAE that does not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline withi n 
72 hours, and second occurrence of Grade 3 TRAE of any duration.  
• Grade 4 TRAE . 
• First occurrence of Grade 3 laboratory abnormality that are clinically significant per 
Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol.  and that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline wi thin 
72 hours, and second occurrence of Grade 3 clinically significant laboratory abnormality 
of any duration.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_12704] scheduled dose.  
The cycle delay of treatment for Grade 2 events  is left at the discretion of the Investigator unless 
otherwise specified  in this protocol.   
No cycle delay of treatment or dose modification is required for Grade 1  events.  
The final decision on dose modification and/or corrective therapy will be based on the 
Investigator’s judgment, in the best interest of the participant.  
Recommended guidelines for the management of specific adverse events including irAE, CRS, 
Vascular Leak Syndrome (VLS ) and Infusion -related reactions ( IRR) are presented in 
Section  6.5.4 .

Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI -CTCAE ) V5.0 (see Section 8.3. 8 of the master 
protocol ). In case a specific adverse event meets the  AESI definition it must be documented in the 
e-CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -relat ed reactions (I RR)  
Participants should routinely receive premedication as detailed in Section 6.1.2 .1 of the master 
protocol prior to SAR444245 administration, to prevent or reduce the inc idence or severity of 
IRRs.  
An infusion -related reaction in this study is defined as any signs or symptoms which develop 
during the infusion or up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion. The term IRR indicates 
only a specific temporal relationshi p with the infusion and does not specify a particular 
mechanism underlying the signs or symptoms.   
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening infusion -reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms usually develop du ring or shortly after drug 
infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. Dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines on pembrolizumab -associated infusion reaction 
are provided in Table  3.  
After an infusion -related reaction due to pembrolizumab infusion (Grade 3 or Grade 4), the 
SAR444245 infusion will be delayed and can be administered after resolution of symptoms. The 
Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor’s Med ical Monitor if the SAR444245 infusion needs 
to be delayed more than [ADDRESS_12706] the next SA R444245 infusion given at half the infusion 
rate. For instructions on premedication at subsequent dosing, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Fever, flu -like symptoms and cytokine -release syndrome (CRS)  
Fever can frequently happen with infusion of IL -2 and may possibly evolve into flu -like 
symptoms or could be an early manifestation of CRS. Fever or flu -like symptoms should be 
graded according to CTCAE V5.0 and managed according to institutional standards.  
Cytokine -release syndrome should be graded as per American Society for Transplant ation and 
Cellular Therapy (ASTCT ) criteria integrated with central laboratory cytokine results, and 
managed per guidelines in Table 5. If any grade of CRS is suspected, sites should make every 
effort to draw an additional blood sample for cytokines levels (by [CONTACT_12115]) prior to the 
administration of tocilizumab, as well as C -reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin (by [CONTACT_13213]).  
Sites should have at least 2 full doses of tocilizumab available and access to an intensive care unit 
(ICU ), in case participants develop CRS.  
Guidelines for management of CRS accordin g to severity grading are provided in Table 5. 
ASTCT CRS consensus grading scale is provided in Section 10.1 1 of the master protocol.

subsequent treatment should be resumed only when symptoms have resolved 
or improved to Grade 1  at  µg/kg or permanently discontinued, as clinically 
indicated.  
If CRS Grade 4, SAR444245 should be permanently discontinued, as clinically 
indicated.  
If CRS Grade 3 or Grade 4, IV corticosteroids should be initiated (outside of 
the context of CAR -T cells, corticosteroids alone maybe initiated in first 
intention) and tocilizumab considered, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027]/or other 
vasopressors should be administered as needed. Participants with severe 
CRS may require management in intensive c are setting, with monitoring of 
clinical status and laboratory tests performed at least daily.  
As the participant improves, the intensity of the monitoring and setting can be 
decreased, but the participant should not be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13028]. Corticosteroids can then be administered IV  or orally every 
8 hours for up to 3 days, then tapered over 4 days. In general, tapering of 
steroids can start when vasopressors and high -flow oxygen are no longer 
needed.  
CRS is considered res olved when there is sustained resolution of fever and 
there is no longer a need for oxygen supplementation to relieve hypoxia nor 
vasopressors to maintain blood pressure; however, normalization of 
temperature alone does not define resolution of CRS.  
 If no clinical improvement in oxygenation, hypotension, fever, and other CRS 
manifestations is observed within 24 to 72 hours, management for persistent 
or worsening CRS should be initiated. Re -evaluation for other contributing 
conditions should be done, such as infection, cardiac, thromboembolic and 
other complications. Intravenous Tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg (for participants  
weighing ≥30 kg) should be administered, and steroids should be 
administered concurrently. If still no improvement in oxygenation, hypotension , 
fever and other manifestations is observed after the first dose of tocilizumab, it 
may be repeated after an inte rval of at least 8 hours and should not exceed 
4 doses in total.  
For participants with severe CRS who fail to improve after repetitive treatment 
with both tocilizumab and steroids, alternative options should be discussed 
with clinical site specialists  
a Information for preparation and storage of SAR444245 is provided in the pharmacy manual.  
b Fever is defined as temperature ≥38°C not attributable to any other cause. In patients who have CRS then receive antipyretic or anticytokine 
therapy such as tocilizumab or steroids, fever is no longer required to grade subsequent CRS severity. In this case , CRS grading is driven by 
[CONTACT_13199]/or hypoxia.  
c CRS grade is determined by [CONTACT_13200]: hypotension or hypoxia not attributable to any other cause. For example, a patient with 
temperature of 39.5°C, hypotension requiring 1 vasopressor, and  hypoxia requiring low -flow nasal cannula is classified as Grade  3 CRS.  
d Low-flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at ≤6 L/minute. Low flow also includes blow -by [CONTACT_13201], sometimes used in 
pediatrics. High -flow nasal cannula is defined as oxygen delivered at >6 L/minute.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 44 [IP_ADDRESS]  Immune -related adverse events   
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect  more than one body system simultaneously. 
IrAEs are thought to be caused by [CONTACT_13214]. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce 
complications. Based on existing pembrolizumab clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible 
and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab  and/or SAR444245 , administration of 
corticosteroids and/or other supportive care.  
Investigators must be extremely vigilant and be ready to intervene early in the management of 
irAEs because the onset of symptoms of irAEs (eg, pneumonitis) may be subtle. For suspected 
irAEs, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm etiology or exclude neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, to xin, or other etiologic causes. Additional procedures or tests such as 
bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the 
severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer 
corticos teroids.  
SAR444245 may increase the incidence and severity of these events.  
Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs are provided in Table  6. Of 
note,  when study interventions are administered  in combination,  if the AE is considered immune -
related, both drugs in the combination should be held according to recommended dose 
modifications.  If a participant experiences several irAEs, the most conservative recommendation 
should be followed.  
The CTC AE V5.[ADDRESS_12708] be used to grade the severity of AEs.  
When pembrolizumab can be restarted, it should be administered at the initial planned dose and 
schedule as no modification is allowed:  
• If the toxicity does not resolve or the criteria for resuming treatme nt are not met, the 
participant must be discontinued from all study drugs.  
• If the toxicities do resolve and conditions are aligned with what is defined in Table  6, the 
combination of SAR444245 or  pembrolizumab may be restarted at the discretion of the 
investigator.  In these cases where the toxicity is attributed to the combination or to 
SAR444245 alone, re -initiation of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy may be considered 
after communication with the Sponsor.

Immune cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome  (ICANS)  is a n europsychiatric syndrome which 
is frequently associated with CRS; however, it is specifically excluded from the definition of CRS 
and can occur during the course of CRS, after its resolution, or independently from CRS. Clinical 
findings can be progressive and may include aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment 
of cognitive skills, motor weakness, seizure, and cerebral edema. Severity is evaluated using the 
ASTCT Consensus grading scale, with ICE score for encephalopathy assessment (Section 10.1 1 
of the master protocol). Recommendations for ICANS  management mainly include the use of 
steroids, whereas tocilizumab should only be used in the context of CRS, as outlined i n Table 7. 
The proposed management should be considered only as recommendations and in light of 
recommendations from site specialist.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Vascular leak syndr ome (VLS)  
Vascular leak syndrome is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_13242]. This syndrome 
is observed in patients who demonstrate a state of generalized leaky capi[INVESTIGATOR_13032], low -flow states, ischemia -reperf usion injuries, toxemias, medications, or poisoning. 
In various human diseases, an increase in capi[INVESTIGATOR_13033] -rich fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space manifested by [CONTACT_13219]: diffuse pi[INVESTIGATOR_13034], exudative serous cavity effusions, 
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, and, in some cases, hypovolemic shock with 
multiple -organ failure.  Fluid management is the cornerstone of VLS management; it is a b alance 
between maintaining the intravascular volume to ensure organ perfusion to prevent organ failure, 
while avoiding volume overload. The management of VLS according to severity grading is 
described in Table 8. These guidelines are not comprehensive and the Investigator should exercise 
clinical judgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual participant and refer to 
current guidelines to the topic ( 1).

HCC patients are at risk for a range of complicat ions that can cause hepatic laboratory 
abnormalities with or without clinical decompensation. Those with a history of chronic HCV or 
HBV infection also have the potential to experience virologic flares. Immune -related hepatitis has 
been observed in approxi mately 1 -2% of participants who received pembrolizumab. The 
following section provides further guidance on the diagnosis and management of potential hepatic 
complications among HCC participants in this study. The recommendation is to hold study  
interventio ns (cycle delay when SAR444245 is withhold + pembrolizumab  is withhold) . If 
toxicity does not improve within 1 to 2 days or worsens, follow “Management of HE for 
Pembrolizumab/ SAR4444245 ” below.

protocol, and with the exception of the TRAEs resolving within 5 days. After 
cycle delay, such participants may be considered for treatment resumption 
once the TRAE resolves or improves to G rade 1 or baseline or is stable and 
manageable through supportive/medical therapy.” has been changed to 
“Participants who experience Grade ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the study 
(including clinically significant Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities as defined in 
Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol) not listed in Section 6.5.4 (Tables 3 -8)

Please refer to the Master Protocol fo r description of common protocol elements. Cohort -specific 
protocol elements are described below.  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol title:   
A Phase 2 non -randomized, open -label, multi -cohort, multi -center study assessing the clinical 
benefit of SAR444245 (THOR -707) combin ed with  pembrolizumab or cetuximab for the 
treatment of participants with advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer  
Brief  title:  A study of SAR444245 combined with pembrolizumab or cetuximab  for the 
treatment of participants with colorectal cancer  
Rational e: 
Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and non-human primate  (NHP ) models while anti -PD1 antibody prevents 
T cell suppr ession through the programmed cell death -1/programmed cell death -ligand 
1 (PD1 /PD-L1) pathway. The combination of anti -PD1 treatment with SAR444245 was tested in 
the syngeneic murine CT -26 colon cancer model and induced enhanced anti -tumor activity as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_13226] (CR ) and tumor -free surviving 
animals compared to each agent in monotherapy. These data support evaluation of SAR444245 in 
combination with an anti -PD1 antibody.  
Clinical data from the on -going monotherapy dose escalation of SAR444245 ( HAMMER study) 
has indicated a periphe ral increase in the number of NK cells.  NK cells are important effector 
cells which mediate antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for IgG1 antibodies such as 
cetuximab. In vitro data where NK cells pretreated with SAR444245 and then co -cultured with 
the EGFR -expressing A431 cancer cells improved the ADCC function of cetuximab in 
a dose-dependent fashion. These data support the evaluation of SAR444245 in combination with 
cetuximab.  
The proposed study aims to establish proof -of-concept that combini ng the no n-alpha -IL2 
SAR444245 with either the anti -PD1 antibody pembrolizumab or with the anti -EGFR IgG1 
antibody cetuximab will result in a significant increase in the percentage of patients experiencing 
an objective response in the setting of advanced u nresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) .

Please refer to the master protocol for common description of the study duration for a participant 
in Cohort s D1 and D2 . For treatment period, the completion of Cycle 35 is only applicable for 
Cohort D1. 
Study intervention(s)  
Cohort D1 (SAR444245 + p embrolizumab)  
Dosing sequence:
Invest igational medicinal products  
Pembrolizumab  
• Formulation : Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) as 100 mg/4 mL (25 mg/mL) solution in 
single -dose vials  
• Route of administration : intravenous (IV) infusion.  
• Dose regimen : Pembrolizumab will be administered as a dose of 200 mg using 
a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 3 -week treatment cycle for up to 35 cycles . 
Study sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from sit e to site, a window 
between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 
30 minutes -5 min/+10  min).  
SAR444245  
SAR444245 formulation, route of administration, and dose regimen  as described in the master 
protocol. Treatment duration for Coh ort D1 is up to 35 cycles.  
Noninvestigational medicinal products  
Please refer to the master protocol.  
After 4 cycles, i n case of permanent SAR444245 discontinuation and continuation of 
pembrolizumab treatment as part of AE management, premedication no long er needs to be 
administered.

Cetuximab  
Cetuximab will be administered  .  
• Formulation:  
- a clear, colorless solution for injection provided as 100 mg/50 mL (2  mg/mL) or 
200 mg/100 mL in a single -dose vial  
or  
- 100 mg/20 mL or 500 mg/100 mL  
or 
- any other cetuximab formulation approved locally.  
• Route of administration: IV infusion  
Dose regimen : Cetuximab will be given on Cycle 1 Day 1 as an initial loading dose of 400 mg/m2 
infused over 120 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 mg /min, or as per local practice and labels)  
followed by 250 mg/m² infused over 60 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 mg/min) for all 
subsequent doses starting with the Cycle 1 Day 8 administration, until PD . 
Noninvestigational medicinal products  
Premedicatio n for SAR444245 as described in the master protocol.  
Premedication for cetuximab  
All participants who will receive cetuximab should be premedicated with diphenhydramine 25 to 
50 mg IV (or equivalent) prior to the first dose of cetuximab or any other recomm ended 
premedication as per local requirements . Premedication for subsequent doses of cetuximab should 
be given per medical judgment and history of prior infusion reactions (IRs).  
Each dose of cetuximab will be followed by a 1 -2 hours observation period. If  there are no 
reported infusion -related reactions  (IRRs)  during this observation period, then the SAR444245 
dose may be administered at applicable dosing visits.  
When SAR444245 and cetuximab are given on the same day, participants who have received 
diphenh ydramine as cetuximab premedication may skip the diphenhydramine as SAR444245 
premedication.

Prope rty of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 21 a Evaluation: Screening assessments to be performed prior to first IMP administration unless otherwise indicated. There is no n eed to perform Cycle [ADDRESS_12764] be  performed, and results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_13245]. After Cycle 1, samples for laboratory assessments (excluding PK & biomarker) can be collected up to [ADDRESS_12765] IMP administrat ion in which study procedures used to support 
eligibility are done.  
b Cycle: a treatment cycle is 21 days. See details in Section  6.1 for IMP administration. If treatment cycles are adjusted, all procedures except tumor assessment imaging will be completed ac cording to the cycle 
number. Tumor assessment imagin g will be performed at fixed time points from C1D1 regardless of any treatment delays.  
c Observation Period: Participants who enter the Observation period will be followed differently depending on the reason leadin g to permanent IMP discontinuation. See Section  4.1. For participant's convenience, all 
Follow -up assessments may occur during the same visit as that when tumor assessment is performed.  
d Survival Phone Call Follow -Up Period: Once the parti cipant stops the tumor assessments due to PD or starts a new antineoplastic therapy, the participant moves into the Survival Follow -up Period and should be 
contact[CONTACT_13110] 3 months ±14 days to assess for survival status. Updated survival status may be requested by [CONTACT_13111].  
e For Cycle 4 visits, please refer to PK flowchart in  Section  1.5. 
f C1D8 and/or C1D15 visits must be pe rformed on site for the following participants only: 1) Participants scheduled to have blood draws for biomarker assessment a nd/or ADA on Day 8; 2) Participants who will 
receive IMP on Day 8 and Day 15. For all other participants, these 2 on -site visits ma y be done remotely as appropriate based on investigator’s discretion per institutional standard and local regulations. If thi s is 
the case, this must be documented in the source document. Sponsor  may decide to cancel safety assessment on C1D8 and C1D15 if safety data justifies it.  
g Weight/Height: Height is required at baselin e only. Weight is required at Screening and prior to starting each infusion. The total dose will be calculated based on the w eight on the day of the infusion or the most 
recent weight a ssuming it was assessed in a reasonable time frame according to Investigator assessment. Study sites should make every effort  to measure body weight as close to the infusion day as possible 
considering the variability of local process from site to site.  If the infusion is prepared with the most recent weight assessed in a reasonable time frame, this will not prevent to assess the  weight on D1 of each 
cycle.  
h For participants with known HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection under antiviral treatment to c onfirm controlled infection, and for all participants in [LOCATION_013] and Italy (see details and specific instructions in 
Section  10.2 and Section  10.7 of the master protocol).  
i Urinalysis using dipstick for glucose, blood, pH, protein, ketones, leukocytes and m icroscopic examination (if blood or protein is abnormal), will  be performed every 4 cycles during Treatment Period and as 
clinically indicated.  
j Endocrine function tests will be performed every 2 cycles throughout the entire treatment period and at EOT. Dur ing the Observation Period, they will be performed at Follow -Up Visit 1. They can also be performed 
as clinically indicated   
k Only for pa rticipants who will participate in the intensive PK sample collection.  
l AE/SAE assessment: Severity will be graded accord ing to NCI -CTCAE v 5.0. ICANS and CRS will be graded using ASTCT criteria integrated with central laboratory cytokine results ( 1).   
m If a tumor biopsy was obtained from a target lesion during eligibility asses sment, it is preferred to obtain a new baseline scan.  
n Will not be done for participants enrolled in China . 
o Brain imaging: For participants with no previous history of brain metastases, screening brain imaging will need to be obtaine d. MRI is the preferred  imaging modality however CT is acceptable if an MRI is clinically 
contraindicated. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases (ie, no neurological symptoms, no requirements for corticosteroi ds, and no lesion >1.5 cm) may participate but will require regu lar imaging of the brain 
as a site of disease as per protocol tumor assessment (TA) schedule. In all other cases, the lesions must be treated. Two add itional scans, obtained at least 4 weeks apart, should be obtained to document disease 
stability after loc al treatment administration to the brain metastases has been completed. If participants receive therapy during these 4 weeks stabilization at the treating physician's discretion, it will be considered 
as part of prior anti -cancer therapy. Participants with  previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable, which is defined as lack of progression on two sets of imaging obtained at least 
[ADDRESS_12766]  14 days prior to study treatment. The screening brain scan may be collected up to 42 days prior to enrol lment.

quality and performed within 28 days prio r to the date of enrollment. On study imaging will be performed every 9 weeks (63 ±7 days) after the date of first IMP and if  clinically indicated. Imaging studies should 
follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts or extensi on. The same imaging technique should be used in a participant throughout the trial. After week 45, tumor imaging should be 
performed every 12 weeks (84 ± 7 days). CT scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and any other locations with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_13067], during 
treatment period until PD. Per the primary tumor assessment criteria, after the first documentation of response or the first documentation of progression (if the participant is clinically stable), confirmatory imaging 
may be performed no fewer than 28 days later. Alternately, the scan performed at the next scheduled time point (eg, every 63 ±7 days) may be used as confirmation. Tumor assessment is not needed for

This study  is developed as a master protocol in order to accelerate the investigation of 
SAR444245 with various anticancer therap ies by [CONTACT_13246] . The 
information that is common to all cohorts is includ ed in the master protocol, and this substudy 
provides details specific to cohorts with advanced unresectable or metastatic colorectal cance r for 
the combinati on therapy with pembrolizumab  or cetuximab . 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Preclinical studies demonstrated that treatment with SAR444245 leads to polyclonal expansion of 
CD8+ T cells in murine and NHP models while anti -PD1 antibody prevents T cell suppression 
through th e PD1/PD -L1 pathway. The combination of anti -PD1 treatment with SAR444245 was 
tested in a syngeneic mouse CT -26 colon cancer model and induced enhanced anti -tumor activity 
as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13206] -free surviving animals compar ed to 
each agent in monotherapy. These data support evaluation of SAR444245 in combination with 
pembrolizumab.  
Clinical data from the on -going monotherapy dose escalation of SAR444245 (HAMMER study) 
has indicated a peripheral increase in the number of NK c ells. NK cells are important effector 
cells which mediate antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for IgG1 antibodies such as 
cetuximab. In vitro data where NK cells pretreated with SAR444245 and then co -cultured with 
the EGFR -expressing A431 cance r cells improved the ADCC function of cetuximab in 
a dose-dependent fashion. These data support the evaluation of SAR444245 in combination with 
cetuximab.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
2.2.1  Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal ant ibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the PD1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and 
programmed cell death ligand 2  (PD-L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has 
high affinity and potent receptor blocking activi ty for PD1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable 
preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an IV immunotherapy for advanced 
malignancies. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across 
a number of indications.  
Refer to the country  approved labeling for detailed background information on pembrolizumab.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 27 [IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmaceutical and therapeutic background   
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known  for decades (2). Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL s) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosi s in various 
malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, p ancreatic cancer; hepatocellular 
carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and RCC. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded 
ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as 
melanoma  (3, 4). 
The PD1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by [CONTACT_13207]. The normal function of PD1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under 
healthy c onditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily 
member related to cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
protein 4 (CTLA -4) that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) ( 5, 6). 
The structure of murine PD1 has been resolved ( 7). PD1 and its family members are Type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable -type (IgV type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasm ic tail responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following 
T-cell stimu lation, PD1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP -2, to the 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta 
(PKCθ), a nd zeta -chain -associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell 
signaling cascade ( 6, 8, 9, 10). The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]1 down -modulates T cell responses is 
similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_13015] ( 11, 12). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-clinical trials   
Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking 
PD1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD 8+ T cells and ultimately leads 
to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities  
(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19). Anti -mouse PD1 or anti -mouse PD -L1 antibodies have demonstrated 
antitumor responses in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, 
acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal carcinoma ( 7, 16, 18, 19, 20). In such studies, tumor 
infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and increased IFN -γ, granzym e B and perforin expression were 
observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD1 checkpoint 
inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo ( 18). 
Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy of anti -mouse PD1 antibody as a monotherapy, 
as well as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models 
(see pembrolizumab IB).  
A summary of clinical trial data and the justifica tion of the choice of pembrolizumab dose is 
provided in Section  4.3.2 .

[ADDRESS_12768] the ligand binding domain of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13068] (EGFR), which is abnormally activated in many epi[INVESTIGATOR_13069] (21). The mechanism of action of cetuximab appears to include 
antibody dependent cell mediated cytotox icity (22) in addition to EGFR blockade, which may 
contribute to its efficacy and may be further exploited. Erbitux (cetuximab) is indicated for the 
treatment of KRAS  wild-type, EGFR -expressing, metastatic  colorectal cancer  (mCRC) as 
determined by [CONTACT_13247] -approved test, as a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin - 
and irinotecan -based chemotherapy or who are intolerant to irinotecan, or in combination with 
FOLFIRI (irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovo rin) as the first line treatment, or in combination with 
irinotecan for patients who are refractory to irinotecan -based chemotherapy. More recently, the 
BRAF inhibitor encorafenib was approved when combined with cetuximab, for the treatment of 
mCRC with a BRAF  V600E mutation, after prior therapy.  
2.2.3  Rationale for mCRC and selected populations and experimental SAR444245 -based 
regimens (Cohorts D1 and D2)   
Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 8. 7% of 
cancer -relate d deaths annually in 2020 , and although overall mortality from CRC continues to 
decline, survival remains poor for advanced disease ( 23, 24, 25). Chemotherapy and targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13070].  
An increasing number of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are able to receive 
3 or more lines of therapy. Treatments in this setting  can include regorafenib (an oral multikinase 
inhibitor), trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_13071] (TAS -102), antibodies that target epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] (EGFR) for patients with RAS wild -type tumors (if no prior exposure), and, where 
approved, ICI  for patients with microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) mCRC ( 26).  
While ICI induce 33%-55% ORR (up to ~65% with nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_13072] -H), this 
population represents <10% of metastatic disease (27), non -MSI-H mCRC remain the majority of 
the cases and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_13073], being either so -called “cold” [CRC molecular 
sub-group CMS2&3 - “immune -excluded”] or “immune -restricted” [molecular s ub-group CMS4]  
(28). So beyond the 2L, in non -MSI-H setting, regorafenib and TAS -[ADDRESS_12769] marginal improvement of overall survival 
(OS_ (6.4 to 8.8 months versus 5.0 to 6.3 months) over BSC or placebo, with minimal impact on 
PFS (1.9 to 3. 2 months versus 1.7 months) and minimal ORR (1 -4%) and despi[INVESTIGATOR_13074], they are overall poorly tolerated ( 29, 30, 31). 
Not only is there a strong medical need in that 3L+ mCRC, non -MSI-H population, but it is  
an opportunity to bring IO in this indication which is known to be refractory to 
immunomodulatory treatments.  Our two hypotheses (exploitation of T cells and NK cells) can be 
tested in 1) 3L+ patients treated with SAR444245 + pembrolizumab and 2) in 3L+ patients, 
RASwt (po st-cetuximab), treated with SAR444245 + the anti -EGFR IgG1 mAb cetuximab.

anaphylactoid reaction,  and hypersensitivity) . Pembrolizumab use may be associated with  
infections (pneumonia), bone marrow suppression (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), 
increase in the level of hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, 
alkaline phosphatase), kidney damage (nephritis, acute kidney injury), a s well as adverse effects 
on the functioning of nervous system (dizziness, headache, peripheral neuropathy, dysgeusia (very 
common) and lethargy). In combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic drugs, 
pembrolizumab administration is commonly associated  with hypertension and cardiac arrhythmia 
(including atrial fibrillation).  
Immune -mediated adverse events are designated as important identified risk s for pembrolizumab 
(32). 
Immune -related adverse reactions, including severe and fatal cases, have occurred in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. Most immune -related adverse reactions occurring during treatment 
with pembrolizumab were reversible and managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, 
administration of cort icosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune -related adverse reactions have 
also occurred after the last dose of pembrolizumab. Immune -related adverse reactions affecting 
more than one body system can occur simultaneously.  
Among the immune -related AEs ( irAEs ) associated with pembrolizumab are: immune -related 
pneumonitis, immune -related colitis, immune -related hepatitis, immune -related nephritis, 
immune -related endocrinopathies, immune -related skin adverse reactions and other additional 
clinically significant,  immune -related adverse reactions (reported in clinical studies or in 
post-marketing experience): uveitis, arthritis, myositis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, Guillain -Barré 
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, encephalitis, and myelit is.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Cetuximab   
The important identified risks for cetuximab include, but are not limited to: infusion reactions 
(including anaphylaxis on the first dose); interstitial lung disease, severe adverse skin reactions 
(with increased risk of secondary bacterial infection), electrolyte disturbances (hypomagnesemia, 
hypokalemia, hypocalcemia) cardiac adverse events (including cardiopulmonary arrest/ sudden 
death), and eye disorders (including ulcerative keratitis).  
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥25%) are: cutaneous adverse reactions 
(including rash, pruritus, and nail changes), headache, diarrhea, and infection.  
The following precauti ons and warnings are to be acknowledged:  
Cetuximab can cause serious and fatal infusion reactions. Infusion reactions of any grade occurred 
in 8.4% of patients who received cetuximab across clinical trials. Grades 3 and 4 infusion 
reactions occurred in 2.2 % of patients. Signs and symptoms included rapid onset of airway 
obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), hypotension, shock, loss of consciousness, 
myocardial infarction, and/or cardiac arrest. The risk of anaphylactic reactions may be increased 
in patients with a history of tick bites, red meat allergy, or in the presence of IgE antibodies 
directed against galactose -α-1,3-galactose. Approximately 90% of severe infusion reactions 
occurred with the first infusion despi[INVESTIGATOR_13075]. Infusion reactions may 
occur during or several hours following completion of the infusion. Premedication with 
a histamine -1 (H1) receptor antagonist is recommended together with monitor patients for at least 
[ADDRESS_12771] occurred in 2 -3% patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck receiving cetuximab with radiation therapy or a cetuximab 
product with platinum -based therapy and fluorouracil. A history of coronary artery dis ease, 
congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias and abnormal serum electrolytes may be predisposing 
factors.  
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) that may be fatal has occurred in <0.5% of patients receiving 
cetuximab in clinical trials.  
Cetuximab can cause de rmatologic toxicities, including acneiform rash, skin drying and fissuring, 
paronychial inflammation, infectious sequelae (for example, S. aureus  sepsis, abscess formation, 
cellulitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis/ulcerative keratitis with decrea sed visual acuity, 
cheilitis), and hypertrichosis. Acneiform rash occurred in 82% of patients across clinical trials. 
Grades 3 or 4 acneiform rash occurred in 9.7% of patients. Acneiform rash usually developed 
within the first two weeks of therapy; the ras h lasted more than 28 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13076]-CLIN-0617851 3.0

and skin sloughing, has been observed. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous 
adverse re actions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune -related 
effects (eg, Stevens -Johnson syndrome or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]).  
Cetuximab can cause hypomagnesemia which occurred in 55% patients in various clinical trials, 
includi ng Grades 3 and 4 in 6% to 17%. Hypomagnesemia and accompanying electrolyte 
abnormalities can occur days to months after initiating treatment. It is recommended to monitor 
patients weekly during treatment for hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, and for 
at least [ADDRESS_12773] not been established. The 
pharmacokinetics of cetuximab, in combination with irinotecan, were evaluated in pediatric 
patients with refractory solid tumors in an open -label, single -arm, dose -finding study. Cetuximab 
was administered once weekly, at doses up to 250 mg/m2, to 27 patients ranging from 1 to 
12 years old; and in 19 patients ranging from 13 to 18 years old. No new safety signals were 
identified in pediatric patients. The pharmacokinetics of cetuximab between the two age groups 
were similar following a single dose of 75 mg/m2 and 150 mg/m2. The volume of the distribution 
appears to be independent of dose and approximates the vascular space of 2 L/m2 to 3 L/m2. 
Following a single dose of 250 mg/m2, the mean AUC0 -inf (CV%) was 17.7 mg*h/mL (34%) in 
the younger age group (1 -12 years, n=9) and 1 3.4 mg*h/mL (38%) in the adolescent group 
(13-18 years, n=6). The mean half -life of cetuximab was 110 hours (69 to 188 hours) in the 
younger group and 82 hours (55 to 117 hours) in the adolescent group.  
Of the 1662 patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received cetuximab with irinotecan, 
with FOLFIRI or as monotherapy in six studies, 35% of patients were 65 years of age or older. 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger 
patients.  
Please refer to th e country -approved cetuximab labeling (eg, USPI, SmPC) for more detailed 
prescribing information.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAR444245 combined with pembrolizumab  or cetuximab  
Combining SAR444245 with pembrolizumab or cetuximab may lead to an increased frequency 
and/or severity of adverse events ( AEs) related to immune activation or may lead to additional 
AEs related to immune system activation for each substance individually or may cause 
occurrences of qualitatively different AEs. Serious adverse drug reactions reported with agents 
known to increase immune activation include pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, colitis, and 
hormonal dysfunction (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). SAR444245 could also increase the incidenc e of 
cetuximab -induced cutaneous toxicities.

pembrolizumab or cetuximab are used in combination.  
The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of SAR444245 combined with the approved dosing of the 
anti PD -[ADDRESS_12775] -26, relatively resistant to immune checkpoint treatment, 
SAR444245 potentiated the activity of an anti -PD1 antibody. Combination treatment in animals, 
when compared to respective monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], increased the number of complete responses and 
prolonged survival which was durable as demonstrated by [CONTACT_13211]-engraftment on the tumor free animals, indicating the establishment of durable memo ry T-cell 
population in response to the initial treatment (see SAR444245 IB).  
Non-MSI-H mCRC are known to not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, being qualified as 
immune excluded or restricted tumors. Combining SAR444245 may unleash inflammatory 
response in the tumor microenvironment and sensitize CRC to anti -PD1. Preclinical and 
preliminary clinical data indicates that SAR444245 expands NK cells which are important 
effector cells mediating antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for IgG1 ant ibodies 
such as cetuximab. In vitro experiments show that SAR444245 improved the ADCC function of 
cetuximab in a dose -dependent fashion. The expansion of NK cells induced by [CONTACT_13108]444245 may 
also rescue the activity of cetuximab in KRAS wt mCRC. In 3L+ mCRC, t he benefit of SoC 
remains marginal, and the proposed SAR444245 -based combination may bring improved benefit 
compared to SoC.  
2.3.3  Overall benefit: risk conclusion  
More detailed information about the expected benefits of SAR444245 may be found in the master 
protocol.  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants in this study, the potential 
risks identified in association with this new generation IL -2 SAR444245 combined with the 
anti-PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab or cetuximab are justified  by [CONTACT_13248] .

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 36 4.3.2  Pembrolizumab dose   
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the 
totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W i s an appropriate 
dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications. As outlined below, this dose is justified 
by: 
• Clinical data from 8 randomized studies in melanoma and NSCLC indications 
demonstrating flat dose - and exposure -efficacy relationships f rom 2 mg/kg Q3W to 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W)  representing an approximate 5 to 7.5 fold exposure range 
(refer to the pembrolizumab IB) . 
• Population PK analysis showing that both fixed dosing and weight -based dosing provides 
similar control of PK variabili ty with considerable overlap in the distributions of 
exposures, supporting suitability of 200 mg Q3W  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications. And  
• Pharmacology data sh owing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK [PBPK] analysis) at 
200 mg Q3W.  
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled w ith 
melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, 
PD-L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 
10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of 
these studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -response relationships across the doses studied 
representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 - fold difference in exposure. The  2 mg/kg (or 200 mg 
fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat 
dose-exposure -response relationships were also o bserved in other tumor types including head and 
neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 
[ADDRESS_12778], PK data in 
KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition  (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated 
saturation of PD1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than [ADDRESS_12779] tumor PD1 saturation over a wide range of tumor 
penetration and PD1 expression. This evaluatio n concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W 
achieves full PD1 saturation in both blood and tumor.  
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body 
weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown th at the fixed -dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by

Cycle delay  (ie, Day 1 should be delayed for all IMPs) is permitted in case of  treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE ). Dose modification will be made accord ing to the worst grade of toxicity 
observed within a cycle. If a participant experiences several toxicities and there are conflicting 
recommendations, the most conservative recommended dose adjustment should be followed.  
In participants who have SAR444245  dose reduction due to SAR444245 related Grade ≥3 
treatment -related adverse events ( TRAEs ), SAR444245 dose may be re -escalated to  μg/kg if:  
• no SAR444245 related Grade ≥[ADDRESS_12784] 2 subsequent  cycles, AND  
• both Investigator and Sponsor agree that the participant has clinical benefit.  
Administration of the study treatment will be discontinued in the event of a TEAE that persists

according to following rules:  
• For Q3W IMP administration: If toxicity occurs and the participant does not recover on 
the day of planned administration, the cycle will be delayed; restart of study IMPs could 
occur only on the initiation of the subsequent cycle.  
• For cetuximab Day 8 and Day 15 administration in each cycle: if toxicity occurs and the 
patient does not recover on the day of planned infusion or within the following 3 days, 
infusion may be omitted.  
• In case of cycle delay or dose omissions for the recovery of toxicity, the following rules 
should be followed for restart or discontinuation of the treatment:  
- In case of a cycle delay up to 14 days or a dose omission, it is per Investigator’s 
decision to rest art the study treatment.  
- After a cycle delay of >14 days and ≤84 days, or 2 to 4 consecutive dose omissions, it 
is per Investigator’s decision to restart the study treatment or the IMP that is omitted, if 
a clear benefit from treatment is observed and after consultation with the Sponsor.  
- The study treatment must be permanently discontinued if the cycle delay is longer than 
84 days, or if the participant has more than 4 consecutive dose omissions.  
- For any delayed cetuximab treatment, do not repeat the initial dose of 400 mg/m². At 
the restart of cetuximab treatment, a ll subsequent infusions will be at the appropriate 
dose level according to Table  4. 
• Cycle delay or dose omission may be considered  for situations other than TEAEs such as 
medical/surgical events or logistical reason s not related to study therapy. Participants 
should be placed back on study therapy within 21 days of the scheduled delay or omission , 
unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor (for example for national or regional 
emergencies). The reason for the delay or omission should be documented in the 
participant’s study record.  
Modification of dose levels in case of dose reduction  
Dose reduction steps for cetuximab are shown in Table  4. One or several doses of cetuximab ca n 
be omitted.

6.5.3  General guidelines for the management of treatmen t-related adverse events   
Participants  who experience Grade  ≥3 TRAEs at any time of the study (including clinically 
significant Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities as defined in Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol ) 
not listed in Section  6.5.4  (Tables 5-11) will be required to temporarily cycle delay the IMP. After 
cycle delay, such participants may be considered  for treatment resumption once the TRAE 
resolves or improves to Grade 1 or baseline.  
The dose of SAR444245 should be reduced to μg/kg (with th e exception of lymphocytopenia 
which is directly associated with SAR444245 mode -of-action and does not require dose 
reduction) in cases of:  
• First occurrence of Grade 3 TRAE that does not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within 
72 hours, and second occurrence  of Grade 3 TRAE of any duration.  
• Grade 4 TRAE . 
• First occurrence of Grade 3 laboratory abnormality that are clinically significant per 
Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol . and that do not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline within 
72 hours, and second occurre nce of Grade 3 clinically significant laboratory abnormality 
of any duration.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_12788] scheduled dose.  
The cycle delay of treatment for Grade 2  events  is left at the discretio n of the Investigator unless 
otherwise specified  in this protocol.   
No cycle delay of treatment or dose modification is required for Grade 1  events.  
The final decision on dose modification and/or corrective therapy will be based on the 
Investigator’s judgm ent, in the best interest of the participant.  
Recommended guidelines for the management of specific adverse events including irAE, CRS, 
Vascular Leak Syndrome (VLS ) and Infusion -related reactions ( IRR) are presented in 
Section  6.5.4 .

[ADDRESS_12789] (AESIs ), depending on grading according to National Cancer Institute - Common 
Terminology Criteria for Advers e Event (NCI -CTCAE ) V5.0 (see Section 8.3.8  of the master 
protocol ). In case a specific adverse event meets the AESI definition it must be docum ented in the 
e-CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -related  reactions (I RR)  
Participants should routinely receive premedication as detailed in Section 6.1.2 .1 of the master 
protocol prior to SAR444245 administration, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of 
IRRs.  
An in fusion -related reaction in this study is defined as any signs or symptoms which develop 
during the infusion or up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion. The term IRR indicates 
only a specific temporal relationship with the infusion and does not specify a particular 
mechanism underlying the signs or symptoms.   
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening infusion -reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug 
infusi on and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. Dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines on pembrolizumab -associated infusion reaction 
are provided in Table  5. 
After an inf usion -related reaction due to pembrolizumab infusion (Grade 3 or Grade 4), the 
SAR444245 infusion will be delayed and can be administered after resolution of symptoms. The 
Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor if the SAR444245 infu sion needs 
to be delayed more than [ADDRESS_12790] the next SAR444245 infusion given at half the  infusion 
rate. For instructions on premedication at subsequent dosing, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the 
master protocol.

Severe infusion -related reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may commonly occur, in 
some cases with fatal outcome. Occurrence of a severe infusion -related reaction requires 
immediate and permanent discontinuation of cetuximab therapy and may necessitate emergency

CRS is considered resolved when there is sustained 
resolution of fever and there is no longer a need for oxygen 
supplementation to relieve hypoxia nor vasopre ssors to 
maintain blood pressure; however, normalization of 
temperature alone does not define resolution of CRS.  Stop the cetuximab infusion

[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune -related adverse events   
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab trea tment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. 
IrAEs are thought to be caused by [CONTACT_13214]. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce 
comp lications. Based on existing pembrolizumab clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible 
and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids 
and/or other supportive care.  
Investigators must be extremely vigilant a nd be ready to intervene early in the management of 
irAEs because the onset of symptoms of irAEs (eg, pneumonitis) may be subtle. For suspected 
irAEs, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm etiology or exclude neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic,  toxin, or other etiologic causes. Additional procedures or tests such as 
bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the 
severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and/or SAR444245 and 
administer corticosteroids.

Immune cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome  (ICANS)  is a neuropsychi atric syndrome which 
is frequently associated with CRS; however, it is specifically excluded from the definition of CRS 
and can occur during the course of CRS, after its resolution, or independently from CRS. Clinical 
findings can be progressive and may in clude aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment 
of cognitive skills, motor weakness, seizure, and cerebral edema. Severity is evaluated using the 
ASTCT Consensus grading scale, with ICE score for encephalopathy assessment (Section 10.1 1 
of the ma ster protocol). Recommendations for ICANS  management mainly include the use of 
steroids, whereas tocilizumab should only be used in the context of CRS, as outlined in Table 10. 
The proposed management should be considered only as recommendations and in light of 
recommendations from site specialist.

discontinued, as clinically indicated, and upon discussions between the 
Investigator and Sponsor.  
If Grade 4 ICANS, both SAR444245 and pembrolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued .  
Treatment w ith IV corticosteroids should be initiated. Concomitant CRS 
may require tocilizumab and should be handled as described in Table 8 in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Cor ticosteroids can then be administered IV or orally every 
8 hours for up to 3 days, then tapered over 4 days.  
For both Grade 3 and Grade 4 ICANS  
If there is no clinical improvement within 24 to 72 hours, then re -evaluation 
for other contributing conditions  should be done. Administration of 
IV Tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg (for participants  weighing ≥30 kg, total dose 
should not exceed 800 mg) should be considered, and steroids should be 
administered concurrently and repeated as previously mentioned for CRS.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 57 [IP_ADDRESS]  Vascular Leak Syndrome (VLS)  
Vascular leak syndrome is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_13251]. This syndrome 
is observed in patients who demonstrate a state of generalized leaky capi[INVESTIGATOR_13032], low -flow states, i schemia -reperfusion injuries, toxemias, medications, or poisoning. 
In various human diseases, an increase in capi[INVESTIGATOR_13033] -rich fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space manifested by [CONTACT_13252] e 
following clinical presentations: diffuse pi[INVESTIGATOR_13034], exudative serous cavity effusions, 
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, and, in some cases, hypovolemic shock with 
multiple -organ failure.  Fluid management is the cornerstone of VLS managem ent; it is a balance 
between maintaining the intravascular volume to ensure organ perfusion to prevent organ failure, 
while avoiding volume overload. The management of VLS according to severity grading is 
described in Table 11. These guidelines are not comprehensive and the Investigator should 
exercise clinical judgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual participant and 
refer to current guidelines to the topic ( 38).

The initial strategy is to administer boluses of crystalloids with a goal of

Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated  If Grade 3 or Grade 4 VLS, SAR444245 should be permanently discontinued.   
In parti cipants  with severe shock, blood pressure may be only partially 
responsive or refractory to IV crystalloid fluids.  
Severe or persistent hypotension is to be managed by [CONTACT_13220]. A trial of 25% albumin IV is an additional option, although its 
efficacy is limited to those with a severe capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946]. In those who remain with 
refractory shock in the setting of low filling pressures, high molecular weight 
starches such as hetastarch (MW 450 kDa) and pentastarch (MW 264 kDa) 
may be ef fective in expanding the intravascular volume. Supportive care with 
invasive and noninvasive ventilation as well as renal replacement may be 
necessary in severe cases. When available, disease -specific therapy should be 
initiated as soon as possible to faci litate recovery.  
During the recovery phase from severe capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], the endothelial injury 
resolves and the capi[INVESTIGATOR_13035], resulting in stabilization 
of blood pressure, at which time fluid overload symptoms and signs may 
predomi nate (eg, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086], systemic edema, ascites). Volume removal with loop diuretics is the 
first-line therapy in these patients. In those with marginal blood pressure and 
fluid overload, the combi nation of loop diuretics and 25% albumin IV may 
facilitate volume removal. Patients with AKI refractory to diuretics will require 
renal replacement.

be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned. For lesions which fragment/split add together the longest diameters of the fra gmented

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidential  Page 71 Clinical Lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥10 mm as assessed using calipers ( eg, skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion i s 
recommended. If feasible, imaging is preferred.  
Chest X -Ray. Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions  ≥[ADDRESS_12816] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also accept able in certain situations ( eg, for body scans). Other specialized imaging or 
other techniques may also be appropriate for individual case. For example, while PET scans are 
not considered adequate to measure lesions, PET -CT scans may be used providing that  the 
measures are obtained from the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast).  
Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as 
a method of measureme nt. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], 
confirmation by [CONTACT_13222].  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm co mplete pathological response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor Markers.  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor respons e. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in CR.  
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for exa mple, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be 
a potential adverse effect of treatment ( eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytol ogical confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is advised to differentiate between response or SD and PD.

Study i ntervention(s)  
Infusion reactions  Pembrolizumab  
Common, but infusion -related reactions in labeling 
include drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, 
anaphylactoid reaction, hypersensitivity and cytokine 
release syndrome.  
Cetuximab  
Severe infusion -related reactions, including 
anaphylactic reactions, may commonly occur, in 
some cases with fatal outcome. Symptoms may 
occur during the first infusion and for up to several 
hours afterwards or with subsequent infusions. 
Symptoms may include bronchospasm, urti caria, 
increase or decrease in blood pressure, loss of 
consciousness or shock. In rare cases, angina 
pectoris, myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest have 
been observed.  
Anaphylactic reactions may occur as early as within a 
few minutes of the first  infusi on and can occur 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_13089].  
The risk for anaphylactic reactions is much increased 
in patients with a  history of allergy to red meat or tick 
bites or positive results of tests for IgE antibodies 
against cetuximab  
(α-1-3-galactose). In these patients cetuximab should 
be administered only after a careful assessment of 
benefit/risk, including alternative treatments, and only 
under close supervision of well -trained personnel with 
resuscitation equipment ready.  
A cytoki ne release syndrome (CRS) typi[INVESTIGATOR_13090]. CRS is 
normally most severe in relation to the first infusion.  
Mild or moderate infusion -related reactions are very 
common comprising symptoms such as fever, chills, 
dizziness, or dyspnea  that occur in a  close temporal 
relationship mainly to the first cetuximab infusion  Pembrolizumab  
Dose modification and treatment guidelines for 
pembrolizumab infusion associated reactio ns 
are provided in Table  5. 
Cetuximab  
Occurrence of a severe infusion -related 
reaction requires immediate and permanent 
discontinuation of cetuximab therapy and may 
necessitate emergency treatment.  
It is recommende d to warn patients of the 
possibility of such a late onset and instruct 
them to contact [CONTACT_13253] -related reaction occur.  
The first dose should be administered slowly 
and the speed must not exceed 5 mg/min 
whilst a ll vital signs are closely monitored for 
at least two hours. If during the first infusion, 
an infusion -related reaction occurs within the 
first 15 minutes, the infusion should be 
stopped. A careful benefit/risk assessment 
should be undertaken including con sideration 
whether the patient may have performed  IgE 
antibodies before a  subsequent infusion is 
given.  
Premedicate with a histamine -1 (H1) receptor 
antagonist prior to cetuximab administration. 
Monitor patients for at least [ADDRESS_12817] labeling (eg, USPI, 
SmPC) for cetuximab.  
 
If an infusion -related reaction develops later 
during the infusion or at a subsequent infusion 
further management will depend on its 
severity:

c) Grade 3 and 4:  
stop infusion immediately, treat symptoms 
vigorously and contraindicate further use of 
cetuximab  
 
If the patie nt experiences a mild or moderate 
infusion -related reaction, the infusion rate may 
be decreased. It is recommended to maintain 
this lower infusion rate in all subsequent 
infusions.  
 
A close monitoring of patients, particularly 
during the first administrati on, is required. 
Special attention is recommended for patients 
with reduced performance status and pre -
existing cardio -pulmonary disease  
Immunogenicity (Anti -
drug antibodies)  Cetuximab  
The development of human anti -chimeric antibodies 
(HACA) is a class ef fect of monoclonal chimeric 
antibodies. Current data on the development of 
HACAs is limited. Overall, measurable HACA titers  
were noted in 3.4% of the patients studied, with 
incidences ranging from 0%  to 9.6% in the target 
indication studies. No conclusive  data on the 
neutralizing  effect of HACAs on cetuximab is 
available to date. The appearance of HACA did not 
correlate with the occurrence of hypersensitivity 
reactions or any other undesirable effect to 
cetuximab.   
Hypersensitivity, 
including anaphylaxis  Pembrolizumab  
Not specifically reported but included among infusion -
related reactions in label.  
Cetuximab  
Please see above within Infusion reactions  Exclusion of participants with known 
hypersensitivity to any components of 
pembrolizumab.  
Also, see specif ic instructions for cetuximab.  
Infections  Pembrolizumab  
Common: pneumonia.  
Cetuximab  
Patients who receive cetuximab in combination with 
platinum -based chemotherapy are at an increased 
risk for the occurrence of severe neutropenia, which 
may lead to subseq uent infectious complications 
such as febrile neutropenia, pneumonia or 
sepsis . Careful monitoring is recommended in such 
patients, in particular in those who experience skin See r outine mitig ation  in the master protocol.

fatal outcome, have been reported  
Hepatotoxicity  Pembrolizumab  
Hepatitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, including 
Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 0.1%, 0.5% and 0.1% 
patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The 
median time to onset of hepatitis was 3.6 month s 
(range 8 days to 21.4  months). The median duration 
was 1.1 months (range 1 day to 20.9+  months). 
Hepatitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 
0.3% patients. Hepatitis resolved in 36  patients.  
Cetuximab  
Increase in liver enzymes is very common  Exclusion of participants with impaired liver 
functions.  
Monitor clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic

Cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death have 
occurred in 2 -3% patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck receiving cetuximab 
with radiation therapy or a cetuximab product with 
platinum -based therapy and fluorouracil cetuximab. A 
history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart 
failure, or arrhythmias and abnormal serum 
electrolytes may be predisposing factors.   Specifically, for patients r eceiving cetuximab, 
exclude patients with electrolytes (magnesium, 
calcium and potassium) <LLN and monitor 
serum electrolytes weekly during and for at

Interstitial lung disease  Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatal 
cases, have been reported, with the majority of 
patients from the Japanese population.  
Confounding or contributing factors, su ch as 
concomitant chemotherapy known to be associated 
with ILD, and pre -existing pulmonary diseases were

should be closely monitored for ILD. In the 
event of symptoms (such as dyspnoea, cou gh, 
fever) or radiographic findings suggestive of 
ILD, prompt diagnostic investigation should 
occur.  
Dermatological 
toxicities  Pembrolizumab:  
Refer to immune -related adverse events  
Cetuximab:  
Cetuximab can cause dermatologic toxicities, 
including acneifor m rash, skin drying and fissuring, 
paronychial inflammation, infectious sequelae (for 
example, S. aureus  sepsis, abscess formation, 
cellulitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis/ulcerative 
keratitis with decreased visual acuity, cheilitis), and 
hypert richosis. Acneiform rash occurred in 82% of 
patients across clinical trials. Grades 3 or 4 acneiform 
rash occurred in 9.7% of patients. Acneiform rash 
usually developed within the first two weeks of 
therapy; the rash lasted more than [ADDRESS_12819] patients. Life -threatening 
and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with 
blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing, has been 
observed. It could not be determined whether these 
mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly 
related to EGFR inh ibition or to idiosyncratic immune -
related effects (eg, Stevens -Johnson syndrome or 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]).  For cetuximab:  
Monitor patients for dermatologic toxicities and 
infectious sequelae. Instruct patients to limit 
sun exposure during cetuximab t herapy. 
Withhold, reduce dose or permanently 
discontinue cetuximab based on severity of 
acneiform rash or mucocutaneous disease  
Risks related to special populations

outcomes  Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab should not be u sed during pregnancy 
unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with pembrolizumab.  
Cetuximab  
EGFR is involved in foetal development. Limited 
observations in animals are indicative of a placental

(including clinically significant Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities 
as defined in Section 10.3.1 of the master protocol) not listed in 
Section 6.5.4 (Tables 5 -11) will be required to temporarily delay 
the IMP. After cycle d elay, such participants may be considered 
for treatment resumption once the TRAE resolves or improves 
to Grade 1 or baseline”.  
Dose reduction rules have added, and the following sentence 
has been deleted “Dose reduction for SAR444245 from 
µg/kg to  µg /kg (or another lower recommended dose) 
may be decided when specified in the protocol or following

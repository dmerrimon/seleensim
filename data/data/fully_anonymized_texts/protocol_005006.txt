All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS®Version 9. 3(or higher).  
2 Statistical and analy tical plans
2.1 Stud y design
This is a phase II, open label study  to determine the efficacy  and safety  of treatment with 
ribociclib (LEE011) inpatients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies that have 
been pre-identified as having CDK4/6, cyclin D1/3, or p16 aberrations and whose disease has 
progressed on or after standard treatment. Pre-identification of the relevant gene mutation or 
amplification status will be performed locall y at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA )certified laboratory  prior to participation on the trial.  
To be eligible for enrollment to this study , patientsmust have archival tissue available for 
submission to allow for molecular testing related to pathway  activation. If tissue is not 
available or is insufficient the 
patient must be willing to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy  to 
allow for these analyses.Mutation types from both local and central laboratories will be 
analyzed.
Patient s must have received at least one prior treatment for their recurrent, metastatic and/or 
locally  advanced disease and have no remaining standard therapy  options anticipated to result 
in a durable response. Patient s received ribociclib on a flat scale of 600 mg once daily, 3 
weeks on and 1 week off. A complete treatment cycle is defined as 28 days. Patient s may 
continue on study  treatment until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable
toxicity , death, or any other reasons (e.g., physician’s decision). The patient may not receive 
any additional anti-cancer therapy  during treatment with ribociclib. After discontinuation of 
study  treatment, patient s, regardless of reason for study  treatment discontinuation ,will be 
followed for safet y for [ADDRESS_387197] patient has enrolled in the study  regardless of treatment 
discontinuation reason (except if consent is withdrawn). If the study ’sprimary  efficacy 
endpoint is not met, [COMPANY_001] may  decide not to conduct survival follow up for the study .

2.2 General overview of statistical methodology
Data from all centers that participate in this protocol will be used. Data used for the analy ses 
specified in this document will come from the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. In 
addition, the mutation data from the central laboratory  will be collected in an Excel 
spreadsheet format and subsequent ly be uploaded to a secure FTP site by [CONTACT_5343].
The analy ses stated in this document will be based on all patients’ data up to the time when all 
patients have had the opportunity  to complete at least 4 cycles (or 16 weeks) of study 
treatment or discontinu ed study . The data cut -off date will be the date when the last patient on 
treatment completes 4 cycles of study  treatment.  This will be the cut -off point for the clinical 
study  report (CSR). Additional data for patients continuing to receive study  treatme nt beyond
the data cut-off date for the primary  CSR will be reported once all patients have discontinued 
treatment or been lost to follow -up.
All statistical analy ses presented in this document are related to patient background 
information , efficacy ,and safety . All analyses are descriptive and no hypothesis testing is 
planned (except for the primary  efficacy  variable, which is described in Section 8below ). For 
continuous data, the mean, standard deviation (SD) , median, 25thand 75thpercentiles, 
minimum, and maximum will bepresented. For categorical data, frequencies and percentages
will bepresented . In general, data from all centers will be combined for any analysis. There 
will be no stratification factor considered for the analysis with the exception of tumor type in 
the primary  efficacy  variable analyses. Missing data will not be imputed. All data collected in 
the study  will be presented in the listings.
The primary  efficacy  objectives of the study ,clinical benefit (e.g., for solid tumor –CR, PR, 
stable disease [SD] ≥ 16 weeks) associated with ribociclib treatment based on local 
investigator assessment ,will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2329] a Bayesian hierarchical model for
evaluat ion oftrial success and futility , and the relationship between pathway  activation and 
response (if applicable) . Analy sis details aredocumented in Section 8.
In addition, with all solid tumor types combined and separatel y for each hematological tumor 
type, the clinical benefit rate (CBR) will be provided with its 95% exact confidence interval 
(CI) (using clopper -pearson1method) ; overall response rate (ORR, e.g., partial response [PR]
and complete response [CR] for solid tumor ) and its 95% CIwill be present ed.Summary  on 
numbers and percentages of patient s for each response category (e.g., for solid tumor -CR, 
PR, stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD], not evaluable [NE] )will also be provided . 
For tumor types that have ten (10) or more patients, separate summaries will be performed by 
[CONTACT_314711] .In the event that there are fewer than 4 patients 
for a hematological tumor ty pe, onl y listing will be provided.  
Duration of response (DOR) based on local investigator assessment will also beanaly zed. 
Progression- free survival (PFS) and overall surviva l (OS) will be summarized using Kaplan -
Meier (KM) method ology .
Patient demographics, disease characteristics (including mutation analy ses), ribociclib 
treatment, and s afety variables will be anal yzed descriptively .
Details of the above analy ses are presented in the following sections.

Other clinical benefit and tumor response summaries for tumor types that have 10 or 
more patients enrolled.
In the event of a low response rate, DOR will be listed only.
2.5 Definitions
2.5.1 Study drug
Study  drug = ribociclib [ADDRESS_387201] date when a nonzero dose 
of study  drug is administered and recorded on the dose administration electronic case report 
form (eCRF ). The date of first administration of study  drug will also be referred as start of 
study  drug.
2.5.[ADDRESS_387202]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
2.5.4 Study day
The study  day, describes the day  of th e event or assessment date, relative to the reference start 
date (date of first administration of study  drug).
The study  day will be calculated as the difference between the date of the assessment and the 
start of study  treatment plus 1. If the date of theassessment is before the start of study 
treatment the study  day will be negative and will be calculated as the difference between the 
date of the assessment and the start of study  treatment.
2.5.[ADDRESS_387203] available assessment before or at date of start of study  treatment will be 
used as the ‘baseline’ assessment . For electrocardiogram (ECG), the average of the triplicate 
assessments prior to the first administration of study  drug will be used as the ‘baseline’ 
assessment. In the event of missing pre-dose ECG time-point on the day of study  treatment 
start, the screening ECG assessment will be used as the baseline.
2.5.6 On treatment assessment
On-treatment assessment isdefined as any assessment obtained in the time interval : Date of 
first administ ration of study  treatment through the date of last administration of study  treatment + 
[ADDRESS_387204] complete date among the following:
All assessment dates (e.g. vital signs assessment , performance status assessment ). 
Note, only a true on study  assessment date or patient contact [CONTACT_314712]. If there 
is a visit date without evidence of any actual assessment performed that date will not 
be used. No dates post cut -off will be used .
Medication dates including study  medications, and concomitant medications
administered.
Adverse event dates
Last contact [CONTACT_111929] ‘Survival information’ eCRF (only if the patient 
status is not unknown).
The cut-off date will not be used for last contact [CONTACT_568], unless an actual assessment or 
patient contact [CONTACT_314713] .
Important note: imputed dates (e.g. the analysis cut-off date progra mmatically  imputed to 
replace the missing end date of a dose administration record) will not be used to derive the 
last contact [CONTACT_568] , except for the following: partial date’s imputation is allowed to be used for

3.5 Stud y Treatment and concomitant medications
The safety  setwill be used for all analyses associated with study  treatment and other 
medications/non- drug therap y.
3.5.1 Study treatment
Patients receiv e ribociclib (600 mg) once daily, 3  w eeks on and 1 week off. A complete 
treatment cycle is 28 days.  There is no break between dosing cycles. For patients who are 
unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose reductions or interruptions a re 
permitted to manage drug -related toxicities.
When dose reduction is necessary , the dose of ribociclib may  be reduced to 400 mg.
If an additional dose reduction is required, ribociclib may  be reduced to 200 mg.
Once the ribociclib dose is reduced it cann ot be re -escalated.
Protocol Section 6.3 provides the detailed information for dose modifications or dose delays.
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of exposure
Duration of exposure (days)for study  drug is defined as the days between the last ribociclib 
dose and first ribociclib dose, that is to say, duration of exposure (D1) =(date of last 
administration ofribociclib ) –(date of first administration of ribociclib ) + 1. Summary 
statistics will be display edfor the duration of exposure.
Duration of exposure to study  drug will also be categorized into time intervals (< 3 months, 3 
< 6 months, 6 < 9 months,…, etc.). The number and percentage of patient s in each
categor y will be presented .
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387209]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
[IP_ADDRESS] Adjusted duration of exposure
Adjusted duration of exposure (days) for ribociclib (D) is thenumber of ribociclib dosing 
days a patient would be expected to have received per protocol, given their duration of 
exposure to study  treatment. Since ribociclib follows a 3 weeks on, 1 week off schedule, the 
adjusted duration of exposure to ribociclib isthe duration of exposure to study  treatment 
minus the planned off days for ribociclib .The adjusted duration of exposure to ribociclib (in 
days) is therefore 21 x (# completed 28 day cycles) + minimum of(21, duration of last 
incomplete cy cle). Summary  statistics will be display ed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Cumulative dose and average daily  dose
Cumulative dose is defined as the total dose actuall y given during the study  treatment 
exposure. Average daily dose is defined as [cumulative dose (mg) / cumulative dosing days
(days)].
The dosing record ,as collected in the eCRF ,includes planned one week drug breaks , thus 
cumulative dose calculation will be adjusted according to the [ADDRESS_387210], the calculate dtotal dose of ribociclib willbethe
daily  ribociclib dose x 21 x (# completed 28 day  cycles) + daily  ribociclib dose x min imum of
(21, duration of last incomplete cycle). Since the eCRF does not collect cycle start dates, it 
will be assumed that a new cycle starts when ribociclib resumes after a temporary 
interruption.
Cumulative dosing days are calculated based on actual dosing days, excluding both one week 
drug break and temporary  dose interruption.
Cumulative dose and average daily dose will be summarized using descriptive statistics .
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose intensity  and relative dose intensity
Dose intensity  (DI) will be calculated as follows:
DI = Cumulative dose ( mg) / Adjusted duration of exposure ( days)
Planned dose intensity  (PDI) is the assigned dose by [CONTACT_314717]. The planned dose intensity  for ribociclib during the period of time the 
patient received drug is 600 mg/day .
RDI = DI ( mg/day) / 600mg/day .
DI and RDI will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose interruption and dose red uction
Dose interruption : An interruption is defined as a 0 mg dose given on one or more days 
during the treatment period where a patient is not on the “off” part of a treatment cycle. For 
patients who have dose interruption checked but never resume the non-zero dose, the dose 
interruption will not be counted.
Dose reduction: A reduction is defined as a decrease in dose from the protocol planned dose 
or a decrease from the previous non-zero dose, during the dosing period, even if this decrease 
has been directly preceded by [CONTACT_270420]. For example, in the sequence 600mg – 0mg –
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387211]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
400mg, the 400mg dose will be counted as a reduction ; in the sequence 400mg – 0mg –
400mg, the [ADDRESS_387212] dose reductions or interruptions, and the 
reasons for such reductions/interruptions, will be summarized separatel y.
3.5.2 Concomitant medications/non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314703], concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314704] (see Protocol Section 6.4.1), except as specifically  prohibited (see 
Protocol Section 6.4.2). All medications, procedures and significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(including physical therapy  and blood transfusions) administered within 30days prior to the 
administration of ribociclib and through [ADDRESS_387213] dose of study  drug will be 
recorded in the corresponding eCRF page. 
Concomitant therapy  is defined as all interventions (therapeutic treatments and procedures) 
besides the study  treatment that were administered to a patient, preceding or coinciding with 
the study  assessment period.
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the World Health 
Organization ( WHO )Drug Reference List to allow for categorization by [CONTACT_11702]. In 
addition to categorizing medication data by [CONTACT_11702], drugs will be classified according 
to their ATC classification in order to present and compare how they are being utilized. Non-
drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314705] M edDRA terminology  (v18.0).
Concomitant medications taken concurrentl y with the study  drugs will be listed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_84304], preferred term by [CONTACT_314718]. 
These summaries will include medications starting onor after the start of study  treatment but 
no later than [ADDRESS_387214] dose of study  treatment or medications starting prior to the start 
of study  treatment and continuing after the start of study  treatment. Similarly ,significant non -
drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314706] (SOC) and preferred term.
Any prior medications or significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314707] [ADDRESS_387215] date of study  treatment will be 
listed.
The safet y set will be used for all concomitant medication /non-drug therap ytables and 
listings. 
4 Efficacy  evaluation
All efficacy  analy ses will be performed in FAS.
4.1 Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)
Clinical benefit is determined by [CONTACT_65019] r assessment for each tumor assessment and is 
defined as responses of CR or PR or SD for ≥ 16 weeks . In addition to tumor -specific 
measurements (e.g., radiological assessment of tumor response for solid tumors) , progressive 
disease will also be considered when itwas indicated either as a reason for the study  treatment 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387216]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
discontinuation or as a cause of on-treatment death. CR and PR(for solid tumors) require a 
confirmation that is at least a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial observation of response.
Patie nts who had confirmed CR/PR or SD prior to [ADDRESS_387217] their clinical benefit defined as 
non-evaluable; patient s who had confirmed CR/PR or SD prior to 16 weeks, but progressed 
prior to 16 weeks ,will beconsidered as not achieving clinical benefit ; patient s who had
CR/PR/SD occurred prior to 16 weeks, but progressed at or after 16 weeks without evidence 
of CR/PR/SD at or after [ADDRESS_387218] 80% probability  that the response rate in a tumor type
exceeds the historical rate, then the tumor typewill be considered a success. Details for the 
Bayesian analyses of CBR are located in Section 8.
In addition to the Bayesian analyses, with all solid tumor types combined and separatel y for 
each hematological tumor ty pe, the CBR estimate will be provided with its 95% exact CI. For 
tumor types (within the solid tumors) that have ten (10) or more patients, separate summaries 
will be performed by [CONTACT_314719].In the event that there are fewer than 4 patients for a 
hematological tumor ty pe, only  listing will be provided for that tumor ty pe.   
4.2 Overall Response Rate (ORR)
Overall response is determined by [CONTACT_314720] . For patient swith solid tumors, the assessment criteria will be RECI ST 1.1 and will 
include respo nses of CR and/or PR. For hematological tumors, other appropriate criteria (see 
Protocol Appendix section for corresponding criteria) will be used to determine the responses. 
Ninety -five percent (95%) exact CI will also be provided for the response rates. The number 
and percentage of patient s for different categories of overall response (e.g.,for solid tumor -
CR, PR, SD, PD,andNE) willbe present ed.These analyses will be performed with all solid 
tumor ty pes combined and separatel y for each hematologica l tumor ty pe. For tumor ty pes that 
have ten (10) or more patients (within the solid tumors), separate summaries will be 
performed by [CONTACT_314719]. In the event that there are fewer than 4 patients for a 
hematological tumor ty pe, only  listing will be prov ided for that tumor ty pe.   
Components of tumor assessments (t arget lesion response, non-target lesion response, new 
lesion [y es/no]) will be listed. In addition, Cancer Antigen -125 (CA -125) in the assessment of 
ovarian cancer response , or Prostate -specif ic antigen (PSA) in the assessment of prostate 
cancer response will also be listed.
4.3 Duration of response
DOR applies only  to patients who responded, e.g., for solid tumor, responder is defined as the 
patient’s best overall response being CR or PR. The start date is the date of first documented 
response , and the end date is the date of event defined as the first documented 
progression/relapse or death due to any cause within [ADDRESS_387219]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
presented along with 95% confidence interval only if there are sufficient numbers of events , 
otherwise, only listing of DOR will be provided .Analy ses will be based all tumor types 
combined.
4.4 Progression Free Survival (PFS)
PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of ribociclib to the date of the first 
documented disease progression/relapse or death due to any cause within30 days of the last 
study  drug dose date, and is calculate d as PFS = (date of progression/relapse or death –date of 
first study  treatment + 1).Disease progression noted as the reason for discontinuation of 
treatment will also be considered as a progression event for PFS analyses.
Patients who discontinue or complete study  treatment without disease progression will be 
censored at last adequate tumor assessment on or before the discontinuation/c ompletion of the 
study .For patient swho are still on study  treatment at the time of data cut-off date forthe
primary  analyses, PFS will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment before the data 
cut-off date for the analysis of PFS forthe primary  CSR.Patients who do not have any post 
baseline tumor assessment will be considered as censored at Day  1.
PFS will be summarized and graphed using the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method2.The 
estimated median survival time, the corresponding 95% CIs3, and 25thand 75thpercentiles will 
be provided. In addition, survival -rate estimates with 95% CIs will also be provided at time 
points, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, [ADDRESS_387220] ten (10) or more patients, separate summaries will be 
performed b y the tumor type.
4.5 Overall Survival (OS)
Overall survival, defined as the time from the date of the first dose of ribociclib to the date of 
death due to any cause will be analy zed using methods similar to those stated above for PFS. 
That is, the 25thpercentile , median, and 75thpercentile ofsurvival time with corresponding 
95% CIswill be provided; survival curve and survival rates at time points, such as3, 6, 9, 12, 
18, and 24 months will also be presented. Patients who are alive at the time of 
discontinuation/completion of the study  will be censored at the lastcontact [CONTACT_568] (as defined in 
Section 2.5.7 ).Analy ses will be based on all tumor ty pes combined. For tumor ty pes that have 
ten (10) or more patients, separate summaries will be performed b y the tumor ty pe.
Handling missing month/day in date of death
For ra re cases when either day is missing or both month and day are missing for the date of 
death, the follow imputation rules will be implemented: 
If only day is missing, then impute maximum of[(1 mmm -yyyy), minimum of(any 
valid date from data base used for deriving last contact [CONTACT_568] + 1, cut -off date)]. 
If both day and month are missing, then impute maximum of[(1 Jan-yyyy, minimum 
of(any valid date from data base used for deriving last contact [CONTACT_568] + 1, cut -off date)].
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387221]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
4.6 Clinical Benefit Rate by [CONTACT_314721]-defined mutations. A frequency  summary  will be provided for 
summarizing clinical benefit rate per gene mutation using mutation data provided by[CONTACT_30812](on protocol pre-defined mutations only)as well as local lab. The data will also be 
presented in a listing.
5 Safety  evaluation
The assessment of safet y will be based mainly  on the frequency  of adverse events and on the 
number of laborator y/ECG values that fall outside of pre -determined ranges. Other safet y data 
(e.g. vital signs) will be considered as appropriate .
All safety  outputs will use the safety  set. The safety  summary  tables will only include “on-
treatment” assessments (see the definition of “on-treatment” in Section 2.5.6 ), i.e. those 
collected on or after the first date of study  treatment and collected no later than [ADDRESS_387222] dose but 
worsened during the treatment are also considered as ‘on -treatment’ events. All safet y 
assessments will be listed andthose collected later than [ADDRESS_387223] treatment/exposure 
date will be flagged.
5.1 Adverse events
5.1.1 Coding of AEs
Adverse events are coded using the MedDRA (v18.0).
5.1.2 Grading of A Es
AEs will be assessed according to the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.03.
The CTCAE represents a comprehensive grading system for reporting the acute and late 
effects of cancer treatments. CTCAE v4.03 grading is by [CONTACT_108] a 5-point scale generall y 
corresponding to mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, and death. This grading system 
inherently  places a value on the importance of an event, although there is not necessaril y 
proportio nality  among grades (a Grade 2 is not necessaril y twice as bad as a Grade 1).
If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, grades 1 – 4 corresponding to the 
severit y of mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening will be used. CTCAE grade 5 (deat h) 
will not be used in this project; rather, this information will be collected on the “End of 
Treatment”, “30 -days safety  follow -up” or “Survival I nformation” eCRF pages.
5.1.3 General rules for A E reporting
AE summaries will include all AEs starting on or afte r study  Day 1 (i.e. on or after the day of 
the first intake of study  treatment) and starting no later than [ADDRESS_387224] 
treatment/exposure date. All AEs will be listed. AEs starting prior to study  Day [ADDRESS_387225] treatment/exposure date will be flagged in the listings. 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387226]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_157853], having at least one AE in each body  system/primary  system organ class , and f or each 
preferr ed term using MedDRA coding. A subject with multiple occurrences of an AE will be 
counted only  once in the AE category . 
Separate AE summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_64205] (SOC) , preferred 
term (PT), and maximum CTC grade. A patient with multiple CTC grades for an AE will be 
summarized under the maximum CTC grade recorded for the event. In the summaries 
presented by [CONTACT_479], all AEs will be pooled regardless of whether they are CTC gradable or 
not.
Any information collected (e.g. CTC grades , relatedness to study  drug, action taken etc.) will 
be listed as appropriate.

AEs of interest will also be summarized. Please see Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_387228] (AESI ) consists of adverse events for which there is a specific clinical 
interest in connection with ribociclib treatment (i.e. where ribociclib may influence a common 
mechanism of action responsible for triggering them) or adverse events which are similar in 
nature (although not identical). 
Each of these AESI uses MedDRA categories (Standard MedDRA Query  [SMQ ], [COMPANY_001] 
MedDRA Query  [NMQ ], High Level Group Term [HLGT],etc.) to group preferred terms for 
which there is a specific clinical interest. One AESI can be defined by [CONTACT_314725]. These AESI s are defined in the current version of the ribociclib Safet y 
profiling plan/ ribociclib Case Retrieval Strategy  (CRS) document.

assigned a CTCAE grade of zero.
Abnormal on- treatment laboratory  values will be summarized using shift tables (from baseline 
to any abnormal laboratory value post baseline) by [CONTACT_314727] y grade . The number and percentage of patient s with abno rmal laboratory value swill

[ADDRESS_387236] 30 patient soverall (across all groups) have been dosed for at least 16 
weeks or discontinued, and  then every  13 weeks thereafter. Interim analyses may be 
performed more frequently  dependent on enrollment rate to avoid over-enrollment in any of 
the disease cohorts. At each interim analy sis, the groups will be evaluated for early futility 
and earl y success b y comparing posterior quantities for the response rate to pre -specified earl y 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].
There is no plan for a formal interim analy sis of safet y or other secondary  endpoints for this 
study . However, for publication or other purposes, interim data review of clean data will be 
performed as necessary . At these interim reviews, patient demographics/baseline 
characteristics, the primary  and secondary  endpoints as applicable, and all important safet y 
endpoints will be summarized. No formal report will be issued for these data reviews. In the 
event of rapid enrollment, interim analyses for publication or other purpose may not be 
implemented
[ADDRESS_387237] the realistic expectation that treatment 
effects may differ by [CONTACT_19313]. In this setting, analy tical power calculations are not possible, but 
the design was simulated to obtain the power of the study  as shown in the appendix. The 
sample sizes shown (minimum of 10 forfutility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], minimum of 15 for early success 
and maximum of 30 as a group cap) achieve adequate power for the alternative hypothesis. 
The simulations included the expected variable accrual by [CONTACT_80729] a Poisson process with 
expected accrual also s hown in the appendix.

8 Bayesian A daptive Design
8.1 Introduction
This document outlines the adaptive design framework to be used for all trials within 
[COMPANY_001]’s Modular Phase II study  to link targeted therapy  to patients  with pathway  activated 
tumors.
Although the selected tumor types may vary by [CONTACT_10665], this document outlines the design and 
analysis approach based on 8 example tumor cohorts:
Lung NSC
Bladder
Breast
Colorectal
GIST
HNSCC
Ovarian
Sarcoma
Other tumor types may be considered for trials if 1) 4 or more patients are enrolled in the 
cohort, and 2) a reasonable estimate of the clinical benefit rate is available.
The primary  endpoint is clinical benefit rate (CBR) in each cohort, with  clinical benefit being 
assessed at 16 weeks. All patients will receive the experimental treatment for that particular 
trial.
8.1.1 Primary  Analysis
We let Yibe the response indicator for the ithpatient , and let Rgbe the assumed probability  of 
response within a control population and πg= Pr(Yi= 1 | gi= g) be the underly ing probability 
of response for group g within the trial. We transform to the logit scale for modeling purposes. 
Let θgbe the mean log odds treatment effect, i.e.:
Thus, θ gis the group specific logistic regression coefficient for the treatment within group g. 
The primary  analysis is a set of group specific tests that θg>0, meaning that the treatment is 
better than the assumed control rate for that group. Thus, we wish to test the set of hy potheses
H0g: θg≤0
H1g: θg>0
We proceed in a Bayesian fashion, assigning a prior distribution (discussed below) and 
computing the posterior probability  of H 1gwithin each group g. If, at the final anal ysis,
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387240]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
Pr(θ g>0 | data) > 0.80
Then group g will be declared a success (thus, the final analy sis produces a separate decision 
for each group). The trial also allows for earl y stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314709], described below.
8.1.[ADDRESS_387241] 30 patients are enrolled overall (across all cohorts) , and 
continuing each 13 weeks thereafter till study enrollment closure. After that, one CBR 
analysis will be done at the end of the study . At each interim data review, response 
information for the various groups will be evaluated to determine the current Pr(θ g>0 | data) 
within each cohort, with sufficiently  high/low values used to stop the cohort for 
success/futility . A minimum of 10 patients will be required in a cohort before it ma y 
discontinue enrollment for futility , and a minimum of 15 patients are required before 
discontinuing a cohort for efficacy . If a cohort stops enrolling early, the remaining cohorts 
will continue until the end of 2 years or until the other groups reach their own early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31732]. The final analy sis will occur after the an alysis of the analysis of the study  data for the 
primary  CSR.
The trial will enroll patients in all listed cohorts. In addition, should other cohorts be 
identified throughout the trial, the following mechanism will be used. If another cohort is 
identified, it will not be placed into the statistical analysis unless 3 patient s enroll within the 
cohort (thus, the trial may enroll multiple possible cohorts within the “other” category , but a 
cohort will only be added to the list if at least 3 patients enroll from that cohort). Thus, it is 
possible (but not viewed as likely ) that multiple additional cohorts may  be added to the trial if 
the trial has sufficient enrollment in multiple additional cohorts. In addition to sufficient 
enrollment, the sponsor must have a reasonable estimate of the control clinical benefit rate.
Patient s within any cohort which does not reach the minimum [ADDRESS_387242] satisfied the criteria at the time of the data review.
8.2 Statistical Modeling
We let Yibe the response indicator for the ithpatient , and let Rgbe the probability  of response 
within a control population and πg= Pr(Yi= 1 | gi= g) be the underl ying probability  of 
response for group g within the trial. We transform to the logit scale for modeling purposes. 
Let θgbe the mean log odds treatment e ffect, i.e.:
The statistical design borrows information across groups with a hierarchical model. The 
hierarchical model allows dynamic borrowing of information between groups such that more 
borrowing occurs when the groups are consistent and less borrowi ng occurs when the groups 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387243]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
differ.  In this way, the model is a compromise between the two alternate extremes of either a 
completely  pooled analy sis or a separate anal ysis in each group. We additionally  incorporate a 
clustering mechanism that allows borrowi ng within clusters but treats clusters separatel y. This 
minimizes borrowing across groups that are quite different in terms of CBR.
The purpose of such an analy sis (discussed in more detail in Secti on8.5) is to produce higher 
power or lower type I error in situations where we see some commonality  (identical effects 
are not required) among the groups. The model will borrow more in situations where the 
groups appear similar than situations where the groups appear different.
8.2.[ADDRESS_387244] the amount of borrowing across groups. If the data indicate a large amount of borrowing 
is appropriate (due to similar results), the model will borrow more and thus increase the 
overall power of the trial within each group. In contrast, if the data indicate a small amount of 
borrowing is appropriate (due to dissimilar results) the model will adjust and each group will 
stand more on its own. This “dynamic” borrowing propert y is distinct from other approaches 
which use a fixed informative prior or apriori assume an amount of borrowing across groups. 
Here the approach includes two stages to identify  the appropriate amount of borrowing based 
on the data.
The first stage of model places the groups into distinct clusters. The purpose of this stage is to 
minimize borrowing of information across groups that appear to be quite different. Thus, for 
example, should [ADDRESS_387245] a large probability  on two clusters, one containing the two similar groups with the 
other containing the remaining groups. The model incorporates the uncertainty  of the data in 
this determination, producing a probability  distribution over the possible clusterings. Thus, in 
our example, the model may consider it highly likely  that the 2 similar groups are in one 
cluster with the remaining groups in another, but it would also retain lower probabilities on 
the possibility  allgroups are in one cluster (e.g. we are simpl y seeing differences in the two 
groups by [CONTACT_3364]) as well as other possibilities. The complete analysis averages over this 
uncertaint y. This clustering approach is implemented through a Dirichlet Process Mixture
(DPM) model, described in the appendix.
At the second stage, we place hierarchical models over the groups within each cluster (thus, 
conditional on the clustering, there is no borrowing of information across clusters, only  within 
clusters). The hierarchic al model assumes that the have an across groups distribution
θg~ N(μ, τ2)
The across group mean µ and variance τ2are unknown, and hence have a prior distribution 
which is combined with the data to produce estimates of µ and τ2.
The variance component τcontrols the degree of borrowing among groups.  Small values of τ
result in a greater degree of borrowing while large values of τcorrespond to less borrowing. 
The parameter τis estimated using the data, so the observed between group variation is a key 
component of the model behavior. 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_387246]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
Combined, the two stages allow groups with similar results to borrow information between 
them (they  will have a high probability  of being in the same cluster) while groups with 
different results with borrow far less information between them (they  will have a low 
probability  of being in the same cluster).
Details of the two stages may  be found in Section 8.5.
8.[ADDRESS_387247] 30 patients are on study  for 16 weeks, then every 
13 weeks thereafter till study  enrollment closure. At each interim data review, the groups will 
be evaluated for early futility  and early success by [CONTACT_314730] -specified early  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].
8.3.1 Early  Futility 
If there is less than 10% probability  that the response rate in a group exceeds the historical 
rate Rg, then the group will stop enrollment early  for futility .  Formall y, enrollment will stop 
early for futility  if:
Pr(πg> Rg) < 0.10.
A group is only eligible for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314710] a minimum of [ADDRESS_387248] 95% probability  that the response rate in a group exceeds the historical rate, 
then the group will stop enrollment earl y for success.  Formally , enrollment will stop earl y for 
success if:
Pr(πg> Rg) > 0.95.
A minimum of [ADDRESS_387249] 80% probability  that the 
response rate in a group exceeds the historical rate, then the group will be considere d a 
success. Formall y:
Pr(πg> Rg) > 0.80.
8.4 Simulation
We evaluated type I error and power for each of the 8 possible groups under a variet y of 
possible “truths” indicating various possible true underly ing probabilities within each group.

8.4.1 Assumptions
Accrual –Two scenarios for theassumed two-year expected accrual are investigated: 1) 10 
patient s per group and 2) [ADDRESS_387251] 30 available patients in that group will be enrolled in the study . 
Dropouts – We assume no dropouts for the purpose of this simulation.
Control Rates – Table 1.1 shows the assumed control clinical benefit rates for each group.

We consider four possible scenarios, or possible “truths” in the simulation. These consisted of 
a null scenario (where the treatment has no effect for any group), an alternative scena rio 
(where the treatment is effective in all groups), a scenario where the treatment was effective in 
two of the groups, and a scenario where the treatment was effective in half of the groups.
Treatment Rates -The treatment rates for each scenario are shown in the Table 1.2. Values 
identical to the control are shown in bold, while values greater than the assumed control rate 
are italicized.

A total of 8 scenarios were simulated (two accrual scenarios and four possible ‘truths’ for the

Lung NSC 0.[ADDRESS_387257] is 0 (e.g. the treatment is 
ineffective). Thus, entries in bold are type I errors. Italicized entries appear where the 
treatment is effective, and thus indicate the power of the design.
Generally , type I error is controlled at 0.20 under the null scenario (the borrow ing 
compensates for the multiple interim data reviews) and power is an increasing function of the 
expected sample size (power is higher in the higher  accrual situation across treatment rate 
scenarios).  In the alternative scenario there remains decently  high probability  of success even 
in the lower enrolling groups. When fewer groups are effective in truth, the scenarios “half” 
and “two” are harder to discern. Note in any particular trial there should be a mix of high and 
low enrolling cohorts, thus some cohorts may enroll closer to [ADDRESS_387258]-2015 (10:39) CLEE011XUS03
8.[ADDRESS_387259] stage the groups are clustered according to a Dirichlet Process Mixture 
Model.
The number of clusters is not assumed to be known in advance butwill instead be inferred 
from the data using Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPM). The DPM looks across all the possible 
clusterings of the groups and assigns a probability  to each based on the data. The prior 
distribution in a DPM is governed by a parameter α. When α is small, the prior favors large 
clusters. As α tends to zero, the prior tends to place all its mass on a single cluster containing 
all the groups. As α increases, the prior places more mass on clusterings with a large number 
of clusters. As α becomes very large, the prior places all of its mass on having a separate 
cluster for each group (that is, no borrowing across groups). Thus, by [CONTACT_314731]. Here we choose a moderate version of α=2 (common values 
might be an ywhere between 0.5 and 5) and allow the data more control over the clustering.
The details of the prior are as follows. Let zgrepresent the cluster to which group gbelongs.  
Then zg~ Categorical( p), where pis the vector such that pkis the probability  that a group 
belongs to cluster kand . We construct pusing a stick -breaking process:
and
βk~ Beta(1, α).
A large value of αthus removes a very small amount of probability  for p, resulting in many 
clusters, while a small value of α tends to produce probabilities near [ADDRESS_387260] cluster. 
Conditional on the clustering, we fit a hierarchical model which has an across groups 
distribution 
θg~ N(μ, τ2)

As discussed above, this across groups distribution states that within a cluster we expect to see 
some variation in the parameters, with that variation governed by τ. When τ is small, there is 
minimal variation across groups within a cluster, and thus within the cluster the model would 
approach pooling. In contrast, when τ is large we expect large amount of across group 
variation, and thus even though the groups are in the same cluster the θgvalues may be quite 
different. Apriori we have no way of knowing τ, so we estimate it using the data combined 
with the prior distributions
μ~ N(0, 1.82)
and
τ2~ IG(3,0.5),
where IG(α, β) is the inverse gamma distribution defined by :
[CONTACT_314732] (via Markov Chain Monte Carlo) we consi der the full 
joint distribution of the clustering combined with the hierarchical model parameters. We 
average over the entire range of the uncertaint y in the parameters to produce the posterior 
distribution for each group parameter θg, which is then used to drive the decisions in the 
model.

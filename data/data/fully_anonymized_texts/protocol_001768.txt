Sleep -Disordered Breathi ng, Obesity and Pregnancy, Protocol 1 (SOAP1)  
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page 5 of 27 2. Study Overview  
 
Sleep -Disordered Breathing, Obesity and Pregnancy , Protocol 1  (SOAP 1) is a prospective observational 
study of the interplay between sleep -disordered breathing (SDB), obesity and cardiovascular risk factors 
in pregnancy. Our central hypothesis is that SDB is an effect modifier that increases maternal 
cardiovascular r isk and placental hypoxic injury in obese pregnant women, and that CPAP treatment 
during pregnancy results in an improved cardiovascular risk and placental profile. To test this 
hypothesis, our cohort includes obese women with and without SDB. Refer to the  table below and 
sections 1.1 -1.4 for a discussion of the protocol. Modifications to this protocol are made only with 
approval from the IRB and IDSMB . 
 
After a screening process, e ligible p articipants  are scheduled for two clinic visits, one during the second  
trimester  (14-20 6/7 weeks)  and the other during  third trimester  (28-31 6/7 weeks) . Each visit begins 
with a questionnaire followed by [CONTACT_860518] (PSG). The following morning , clinical 
measurements are taken, maternal bloods are coll ected, and a uterine artery Doppler is  performed. 
Participants with severe apnea at the first clinic visit (i.e., AHI estimate ≥ 50) are withdrawn from the 
study. Those without SDB (i.e., AHI estimate < 5) are assigned to a control group for observation on ly. 
Participants  with SDB  (i.e., AHI estimate 5 -49) are randomly assigned to receive a n autotitrating CPAP 
machine or a sham unit. Autotitrating  units  coordinate air -flow delivery with effort, providing the lowest 
pressure necessary to maintain upper airwa y patency . Sham unit s, meanwhile, have been modified to 
deliver air without pressure . Assignment is “double blinded ,” i.e., neither participants nor members of 
the clinical research team  know  which  units are autotitrating  versus  sham.  All CPAP units includ e a 
modem that transmits data back to the study team. After delivery, SDB participants are unblinded, 
modems are removed , sham units are replaced with active ones , and  referr als to sleep specialist s are  
provided so that appropriate follow -up treatment  can be arranged . Data collection points a nd related 
forms a re discussed in Chapter 5.

5.1. Recruitment and Screening  
 
To identify potential participants  for the SOAP 1 study , the research assistant  (RA) reviews prenatal 
medical records on the EPIC system  and approaches w omen who meet basic  inclusion criteria (i.e., aged 
18 or older, 6 -20 weeks pregnant, and obese) during their  prenatal appointments to ascertain their 
Sleep -Disordered Breathi ng, Obesity and Pregnancy, Protocol 1 (SOAP1)  
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page [ADDRESS_1199601]. This requires cooperation from the healthcare provider and his/her staff, so the PI [INVESTIGATOR_860485].  
 
Meanwhile, some women find out about the study on their own t hrough Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me (pi[INVESTIGATOR_583379].org), a 
searchable database designed for  individuals who are interested in getting involved in research ; flyers or 
pamphlets posted throughout Magee -Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MWH); a  slide displayed on the plasma screens 
in the lobby [CONTACT_860526]; or word of mouth.  If they decide to contact [CONTACT_3476], they are 
prescreened in person or by [CONTACT_648].  
 
The RA ma intains a list of individuals who identify themselves or are approached and follows up with 
those who are interested during subsequent prenatal visits until a  formal  screening visit takes place . 
Repeated contact [CONTACT_860527] . 
 
During the formal screening visit, the RA confirms that the individual has not already been screened 
during this pregnancy or enrolled during a previous pregnancy long enough to  complete the first sleep 
study, both of which are exclusion criteria. Next, a study ID is generated  and a Screening (SC) form is 
completed, in person or by [CONTACT_648], to review  the other exclusion criteria1: 
 A history of sleep apnea, insomnia, diabetes, heart  disease, or lupus  
 Prior use of a CPAP device  
 Use of a breathing machine at night  
 Currently pregnant with twins or higher order multiples (criterion added 6/1/15)  
 Use of a sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_860486]: ID Generation  
 
1. Create a new record on the electronic data entry system (REDCap). A 4 -digit number will 
automatically be assigned.  If REDCap is not accessible, refer to the clinical data management tool

The SC is based on self -report; the RA does not refer to medical records or other sources to verify the 
accuracy of participant responses.  
 
If the individual is found to be eligible, additional information is collected about sleep characterization 
and then details about the study are provided, including the timeline, the randomization process, 
potential risks and benefits, and the importance o f compliance. Prior to seeking informed consent, 
which must be done in person, the RA reminds the individual that there is no obligation to participate or 
penalty for declining to participate, and that her care will not be compromised if she chooses not to  
participate or enrolls and subsequently leaves the study. Prospective participants must sign the consent 
form in order to proceed . The consent process is documented on the Consent Documentation form . 
 
If informed consent is obtained, Contact [CONTACT_7171] (CI) is collected on a paper form and stored in a 
secure place at the study office; it is not entered into the electronic data entry system (REDCap). Next, 
an Initial Interview (II) is completed with que stions about lifestyle, use of medications, prior 
pregnancies, and medical history, and self -reported estimated gestational age is confirmed by [CONTACT_42574]

instructions about how to record bedtimes, wake -up times, naps, and other information. Participants 
are expected to bring the completed SL when they come for Clinic Visit 1, which takes place 14 -20 6/[ADDRESS_1199603] one  week before then.  
 
5.2. Clinic Visit s: PSG, Maternal Bloods, Uterine Artery Doppler  
 
There are two overnight clinic visits, one scheduled during the second trimester (14 -20 6/7 weeks EGA) 
and the other during the third trimester (28 -31 6/7 EGA). Both take plac e at the Sleep  and Behavioral  
Neuroscience Center ( SBNC ). The instructions below are consistent with orders prescribed by [CONTACT_978] (see 
Appendix).  
 
Prior to the each visit, the coordinator review the participant’s medical record to identify any 
medications t hat have been prescribed as well as diagnoses or symptoms that could affect her 
participation. Participants receive a reminder by [CONTACT_648], text, or email (based on personal preferences 
noted on the Contact [CONTACT_465470]) of the coming visit and instructio ns to bring all medications with 
them. This is especially important for participants with hypertension. For the first visit, participants are 
also instructed to bring their completed Sleep Log (SL).  
 
Each clinic visit begins in the evening when the partici pant arrives at the SBNC , usually 7 -8PM. 
Components include:  
 Collection of the Sleep Log (SL) (Visit 1 only). The participant receives the SL from the coordinator 
during screening, completes it on paper, and returns it to SBNC . 
 Administration of a Sleep Qu estionnaire (SQ). The SQ covers general work and sleep patterns, sleep 
habits, snoring and sleep apnea. It is administered online. SBNC  personnel complete the first part 
and the participant completes the rest. SBNC  personnel are permitted to provide assist ance, if 
requested by [CONTACT_2299], but should not rephrase questions.  Prior to submitting, SBNC  are 
asked to review the form for completeness and encourage the participant to fill in any blanks.  
 Presentation of a short video followed by [CONTACT_860529]. T he PI [INVESTIGATOR_860487] a video about the study which 
describes sleep apnea and continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) machines. After the video, 
the participant is fitted for a CPAP mask. Mask type and size are recorded in the progress notes in 
case the partici pant turns out to be a candidate for randomization.  
 Completion of the Sleep Study PM (SSP) form. Weight is measured (this is not self -reported) and, 
after at least five minutes of rest, blood pressure is measured three times, with five minutes 
between meas urements. Any readings >140/[ADDRESS_1199604].  
 “Wire up.” Small electrodes are placed on the participant’s scalp, face, and legs so that technologists 
can monitor her air flow, body movements, heart rate, and oxygen s aturation while she sleeps.  
 Completion of the Sleep Study AM (SSA) form. During the night, SBNC  personnel review the 
participant’s polysomnography (PSG) data to calculate an a pnea -hypopnea index ( AHI) estimate, 
using AASM [ADDRESS_1199605] visit determines eligibility for randomization 
(see below). If a sleep study is not completed successfully – either because a participant refuses or 
there is a medical reason or technical problem – SBNC  personnel should report this on the SSA and 
also notify the Study Coordinator. (Note: sleep studies are formally scored later on but these scores 
are recorded on the SBNC ’s “Harmony System,” not REDCap.)  
 Randomization and assignment of CPAP machine ( Visit 1 only ). Participants with an AHI estimate 5 -
49 and who agree to be randomized are assigned a CPAP machine for the treatment phase of the 
Sleep -Disordered Breathi ng, Obesity and Pregnancy, Protocol 1 (SOAP1)  
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page 13 of 27 study (see “Randomization,” below). The assignment date, unit number, and mask style and size are 
recorded on the SSA. SBNC  personnel should review CPAP use and ca re instructions, included in the 
case, with the participant.  
 Clinical measurements, bloodwork and uterine artery ultrasound. After the PSG, participants are 
escorted by [CONTACT_860530]. Clinical measurements (vitals, height, weight and 
waist, hip and neck circumference) are taken using the SOAP 1 Tanita Protocol (see Appendix), along 
with three measures of blood pressure, and recorded on the SSA; fasting blood is drawn for 
cardiovascular risk profiles and documented on the Maternal Blood (MB) form; and a  uterine artery 
(UA) Doppler is performed . Blood is processed and then stored for future batched testing.  The Study 
Coordinator also takes this opportunity to review the Sleep Log,  to see  if there are any unusual 
responses, and the Sleep Qu estionnaire, to see if any responses are missing , asking  the participant 
for clarification or additional information, as appropriate . In addition, for during visit 2, the Study 
Coordinator asks  CPAP participants  whether all of the equipment is the same as what was originally 
issued and confirms that all components are still correctly labeled.  
 
Eating is permitted until midnight. After midnight, only water is permitted until after fasting blood has 
been collected in the morning. Ideally, participants are asl eep by 11PM but no specific good night time 
(GNT) has been established for the study.  
 
An AHI estimate is calculated at both visits. At Visit 1, the AHI estimate determines group assignment 
(see 5.3, below). At Visit 2, participants who are in the Control Group and who have an AHI estimate of [ADDRESS_1199606] (documented by [CONTACT_860531] a "note to 
file).  
 
Data are entered directly into REDCap, using the study laptop at the SBNC . If REDCap is not accessible, 
SBNC  personnel enter data on a paper form and then give the paper form to the Study Coordinator the 
following morning so that the data can be entered into REDCap  and/or visually verified, if it has already 
been entered by [CONTACT_221774]. Visual verification is requi red for all forms completed on paper and is done by a 
different staff person or at least a day later, if done by [CONTACT_860532].  
 
5.3. Randomization  
 
A participant’s AHI estimate from the first clinic visit determines whether she is randomized, assigned to 
the control group for observation only, or withdrawn from the study.  
 
Participants with an AHI estimate below [ADDRESS_1199607] a hidden  leak. This is a double -blind study, 
so neither participants nor clinical personnel are supposed to know which CPAP machines are active 
versus sham. The DCC stores randomization  assignments separately; they are not part of the electronic 
Data Management System.

1) Refer to the Randomization Log, stored in the supply room wi th the CPAP machines at the SBNC . 
 
2) Refer to the Randomization Log, stored in the supply room with the CPAP machines at the SBNC . 
3) Select the next consecutive CPAP unit number from the list. It is important not to skip any rows.  
4) Select the CPAP carrying case that matches the number from the log. Open the case to make 
sure the unit number on the machine, elbow bag and elbow all match. If they do not match, or if 
any component is missing, make a note on the Randomization log, select the next consecutive 
CPAP unit number, and notify the Study Coordinator immediately.  
5) Complete the Randomization log with your initials, the date, and the participant’s SOAP [ADDRESS_1199610] the same information, plus the CPAP unit number, mask type and size, on the SSA.

by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_860490] (see 
“Participant Compensation,” below). Data ar e accurate in real time only if modems are working 
properly. Otherwise, there may be a lag until data from the memory cards are transmitted.  
 
Instructions: Labeling CPAP Machines  
 
1)  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_860491], along with active and s ham elbows , and notifies 
the DCC when they arrive.  
2)  To keep the clinical staff blinded , the DCC assemble s kits – including the  CPAP machine , a modem, 
and elbow – and labels all of the parts with the circuit number . Kits are stored in canvas bags . 
3) The Clinical Team delivers  the labeled kits to WPIC.  
 
5.5. Home Visit  and Weekly Calls/Texts  
 
CPAP participants are scheduled for a follow -up Home Visit (HV) by [CONTACT_860533]. There is no defined window but, ideally, the visit occurs within two 
weeks of randomization. Additional visits may be scheduled, if needed. In addition to the home visit, the 
coordinator attempts to contact [CONTACT_860534], text and/or email, depending on 
preferences re corded on the Contact [CONTACT_7171] (CI) form, to remind them to continue to use their 
CPAP machine.  
 
5.6. Delivery/Post -Delivery  
 
To ensure that Magee is prepared for SOAP deliveries, the Study Coordinator uses UPMC's Augr website 
to report medical record number s (MRNs) of patients who are participating in the study, adding new 
enrollees and removing those who have already delivered or been withdrawn. In addition, she emails 
the same information directly to the Magee Obstetric Sterile Processing Unit (OSPU), as a  backup 
measure. At delivery, cord blood is collected, placental biopsies are taken, and the placenta is sent to 
the Pathology Department, as documented by [CONTACT_860535] (DS) form. If the 
OSPU is not staffed at the time of delivery, or the participant delivers at a non -study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], it is 
possible that specimen will not be collected.  
 
The Pathology Department prepares and stores slides of the placenta for future analysis by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Parks, a 
study co -PI. Cord blood and plasma are stored by [CONTACT_860536], for possible future analysis.  
 
For randomized participants, the coordinator documents IDSMB  Outcomes (D0), administer s a CPAP 
Survey (CS), consult s the DCC to be Unblinded (UB) about the status of the CPAP unit (active versus 
sham), unblind s the participant, and, if sham, exchange s her unit with an active one, ideally before she 
leaves the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In addition, a referral to a sleep specialist is provided, as appropriate, so that follow -
up treatment can be arranged.

Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page 16 of 27 Process: Unblinding  
 
1. The St udy Coordinator notifies the DCC when she is ready to be unblinded. This should not happen 
until the  DSMB Outcomes (DO) form and CPAP Survey (CS) have  been completed.  
2. The DCC provides the circuit number of the machine that was issued and t he unit type (act ive or 
sham).  
3. After confirming that the circuit number matches, th e Study Coordinator  unblinds the participant  
and collects the modem . 
4. If the unit is sham, the Study Coordinator exchange s the unit with an active one, recording the 
serial number of the acti ve unit replacement, and replace s the sham elbow with an active elbow.  
 
Within four weeks of delivery, a Chart Abstraction (CA) is completed to document  lab results and other 
data related to admission and delivery, labor, maternal complications during pregnancy, postpartum 
complications, pregnancy outcomes, neo natal care, infant status, etc. CAs are completed by a  trained 
chart abstractor. Prior to entry into REDCap, the following CAs must be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Facco:  
 All CPAP participants  
 For non CPAP participants:  
- If delivery occurred before 34 weeks  
- If Yes to any part of section G  
- If Yes to any part of section H  
- If Yes to M1, M2 or M4  
- If Yes to any part of section P  
 
5.7. Participant Compensation  
 
All participants are eligible to receive up to $550 for co mpleting the following procedures:  
 PSG (clinic visits 1 and 2): $150 x 2 = $300  
 Maternal bloods (clinic visits 1 and 2): $50 x 2 = $100  
 Uterine artery Doppler (clinic visits 1 and 2): $75 x 2 = $150  
 
In addition, CPAP participants are eligible for the foll owing payments:  
 CPAP compliance incentive: $10/week2 
 CPAP survey ( delivery/post -delivery ): $25  
 CPAP return (delivery/post -delivery): $40

Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page 17 of 27 6. Events  
 
6.1. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events , including Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes  
 
Over the course of any study, there is always a risk of an adverse event , defined as the unintended 
worsening  of a participant’s signs or symptoms . AEs are characterized in terms of study -relatedness, 
expectedness, a nd seriousness.  
 
The SOAP [ADDRESS_1199613] of AEs considered  both “study related” and 
“expected ”: 
 Minor discomfort associated with wearing the belt, nasal cannula and /or finger pulse oximeter  
during the ApneaLink Home Sleep Monitoring  
 Mild bleeding, bruising, and/or soreness (infrequent ; occurs in 1% -10% of people) during blood 
draws. Other risks include f ainting  and/ or infection ( rare; occurs in less than 1%)  
 Rash or chafing at the site of the monitors, probes and/or electrodes during  the PSGs  
 Brief and/or minor discomfort associated with CPAP use  (e.g.,  minor skin discomfort from the 
mask , nasal stuffiness, runny nose, nosebleed, eye discomfort ) 
 Rash or chafing at the site of the uterine arte ry Doppler abdominal US probe  
 
For this study, adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) are also considered “expected,” even though they 
are not on the informed consent form, because they can, theoretically, happen in any pregnancy.  
Examples include  miscarriage, preterm birth, se vere  growth restriction, intrauterine fetal demise, and 
neonatal death before discharge.  To determine whether APOs are study -related requires unmasking so 
this is handled by [CONTACT_68401]  (see below).  
 
An AE is considered serious if:  
 it is life threatening;  
 it res ults in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged), or disability or permanent damage; or  
 an intervention is required to prevent permanent impairment/damage.  
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unexpected and related, or possibly related, to the stu dy must be 
reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_860492] 24 hours after 
discovery. SAE reporting is done online through the HRPO’s OSIRIS electronic submission system.  
 
Meanwhile, e very non-APO SAE, irrespective of  relatedness and expectedness , must be reported by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_860493], within 48 hours of discovery.  
 
Miscarriages are documented on a Withdrawal (WD) form; all other APOs  are documented during Chart 
Abstraction (CA) following  delivery . For CPAP participants, APOs are also documented on the  IDSMB  
Outcomes (DO) form . All other AEs are documented on Adverse Event (AE) form s. AE and APO data are 
pulled for weekly internal “Events” reports and are also included in bi -annual reports  to the IDSMB . 
IDSMB  reports are unmasked so that members can determine study -relatedness (e.g., evidence  of a 
deleterious effect of sham -CPAP treatment on the fetus ) and consider whether the study needs to be 
modified or even term inated . Documentation and  reporting requirements are summarized in the 
Diagram  1, below .

6.2. Protocol Violations  and Deviatio ns 
 
Protocol violations are defined as departures from accepted clinical research practices or SOAP [ADDRESS_1199614] data quality and the 
integrity of the major scientific goals of the study , and/or involve a significant and repeated breach of 
participants’ privacy. Protocol violations include, but are not limited to:  
 failure to obtain or document informed consent prior to study procedures  
 randomization of an ineligible participant  
 assignment  of incorrect CPAP unit  
 failure to report serious adverse events appropriately  
 breach  of confidentiality  
 unmasking of participant or staff  
 
By [CONTACT_860537], protocol violations are considered the most serious class of departure 
from the  study protocol.

seven days, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_860494], indicating how the problem has been/will be 
corrected and reoccurrences prevent ed. This action plan must be sent to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_860495], along with responses  from the HRPO , to the DCC.  
 
Protocol deviations are defined as departures from SOAP [ADDRESS_1199616] the integrity of the major scientific goals of the 
study, and do not involve a significant and repeated breach of participant privacy. Protocol deviations 
include, but are not limited to:  
 failure to obtain appropriate source documentation  
 mistimed procedures or visit (e.g., conducting a clinic visit outside of  the window outlined in the 
protocol)  
 failure to collect a specimen or perform a test specified in the Protocol  
 administrative error  
 
All protocol deviations must be reported on a Protocol Deviation/Violation Form (PD). If a pattern of 
repeated protocol deviations emerges and it appears that data quality could be compromised or 
participant safety jeopardized, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_860496] a protocol 
violation applies.  
 
6.3. Withdrawals  
 
Participants can withdraw or be withdrawn at any time. No further data are  collected after the date of 
withdrawal but data already collected for study purposes, including biological samples, remain in the 
database and are used for analysis . Withdrawals are recorded on the Withdrawal (WD) form and 
included in reports compi[INVESTIGATOR_860497] -annual IDSMB  meetings.  
 
In addition to the reasons listed on the WD, missing Clinic Visit [ADDRESS_1199617]  at that visit . After randomization, intention to treat principles apply, i.e., 
participants remain in the study for observation even if they are unable to complete one or more 
components of the study  or CPAP needs to be discontinued .  
Sleep -Disordered Breathi ng, Obesity and Pregnancy, Protocol 1 (SOAP1)  
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page 20 of 27 7. Data Collection  
 
Study personnel are expected to enter all data directly into the SOAP 1 electronic data entry system 
(REDCap) at the time of c apture. The only exceptions are the Contact  [CONTACT_7171] (CI) form, 
Randomization Log (RAND),  and Home Visit (HV) form, all of which are  completed  only  on paper and not 
entered into REDCap , as well as the Sleep Log (SL) and Chart Abstraction  (CA), which are  completed on 
paper prior to being entered into REDCap . 
 
A complete set of forms are included in the Appendix, for reference, along with form  instructions and 
the SOAP 1 REDCap User Guide.  
 
7.1. Self-Assessments  
 
Forms marked as “ Participant ” in the table of forms are self-assessments (e.g., Sleep Questionnaires, 
CPAP survey) . Study personnel ar e permitted to provide technical assistance to help participants 
complete forms, including reading the fo rms to them and recording responses on their behalf, but 
shoul d not rephrase  questions . 
 
After a participant completes a self -assessment , Study p ersonn el are expected to  review the form for 
completeness  and, if any field is blank, attempt to obtain  a response  from the participant . 
 
If a participant refuses to complete a self -assessment form, study personnel should off er assistance and 
encouragement . If these attempts fail, a Missing Form (MF) form should be completed  (see below).  
 
7.2. Other Forms  
 
Aside from the self -assessment forms , all other  forms are completed by [CONTACT_3462] , including 
interview -based forms (e.g. , SC, II ), procedure  forms (e.g., MB, UA), and administrative form s (e.g., AE , 
PD). 
 
With interview -based forms, study personnel should follow the prompts but are permitted to rephrase 
questions, if necessary, to obtain valid responses from participants . 
 
7.3. Paper Forms  and Visual Verificatio n 
 
The DCC provides study personnel  with printable PDFs of blank forms, as a backup, in case REDCap  is not 
accessible. The participant’s ID must be written on every page, along with any other header fields (e.g., 
form date , staff initials). Paper form s sho uld be stored securely at study sites, to protect participants’ 
confidentiality , and separate from any identifying information (e.g., names, medical record numbers) . 
The DCC reviews paper forms during site visits (see “Data Quality,” below).  
 
If a response  on a paper forms needs to be changed, the original response should be crossed out and 
the new response written beside it, along with the initials of the staff person inputting the change and 
the date of the change. If there is a corresponding electronic version , that should be updated, too. 
REDCap automatically tracks  who makes changes and when they are made  so that information does not 
need to be entered online.

hours later.  The Study Coordinator ver ifies forms completed at the SBNC  since these are public surveys 
and can’t be retrieved by [CONTACT_860538].  
 
7.4. Missed Visits  and Missing Forms  
 
If a participant misses a  visit and there is no opportunity to reschedule  within the window  (e.g., SBNC  
has no makeup appointments available ), or the participant attends a visit but one or more forms is not 
completed during the visit,  the Clinical Team is  expected to complete a  Missed Visit (MV) or Missing 
Form (MF) form , as appropriate . The purpose of documenting missed and incomplete visits is to alert 
the DCC not to expect data. A missed or incomplete visit that meets the criteria for a protocol deviation 
should also be documented on a PD form.  
 
7.5. Missing Data Codes  
 
In general, fields sho uld not be left blank on a data collection form. Instead, the following missing data 
codes should be used:

The Clinical Team  uses an internal system (“Jack’s system”) t o manage clinical data, including keepi[INVESTIGATOR_860498] . The DCC has access to this system, too, but generally uses it only to 
prepare a monthly report for the Magee obstetric sterile processing unit (OSPU) of participants who 
have not delivered yet.  
 
CPAP data, stored online at encoreanywhere.com, are reviewed  regularly  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_860499]. She has configured her account  so that it does not display data that could unmask her (e.g., 
minimum pressure).  The DCC has access  to these data through a separate account . 
 
The SBNC  uses the Harmony System to man age clinical data, including formal AHI scores.  
 
Management of  all research data  is handled by [CONTACT_15791] . Responsibilities include developi[INVESTIGATOR_860500], training personnel in data collection and entry procedures, creating SAS 
programs to import data from REDCap , compi[INVESTIGATOR_860501], and overseeing regulatory reporting.  
 
Refer to Chapter 9 for information about Data Collection.  
 
8.1. Data Privacy and Security  
 
Study personnel are expected to maintain the security and confidentiality of participant data . To this 
end, three  folders are maintained for each participant’s paper documents , all of which are stored in 
separate locked cabinets : 
 A folder for documents that refer to her only by [CONTACT_860539], with no identifiable data ( i.e., most of 
the study forms )  
 A folder for documents that refer to her by [CONTACT_860540] ( e.g., 
II, CA (which includes admission and discharge date s), requests for appointments at the  SBNC  (which 
include appoin tment date)  
 A folder for documents that include her  name ( e.g., CI, ultrasounds, requests for ultrasound 
appointments)  
 
Receipts for payments and  compliance (which are identified by [CONTACT_40337]), meanwhile, are kep t in a 
separate locked cabinet . 
 
Some ident ifiable data is stored on the electronic data system (REDCap) but access is restricted to 
authorized users with appropriate credentials. D ata extracted by [CONTACT_15791], meanwhile, are stored in 
secure password -protected servers maintained by [CONTACT_478529] P ittsburgh.  
 
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_860502] -approved consent procedures, participant records 
must be destroyed seven years after the completion of the study.  
 
8.2. Data Quality  
 
Data quality begins with training  in data collection and entry pr ocedures  conducted by [CONTACT_860541].  
 
Sleep -Disordered Breathi ng, Obesity and Pregnancy, Protocol 1 (SOAP1)  
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page 23 of 27 In addition, t hroughout the study , the DCC scans data sets  to look for missing data, range violations, and 
logical and chronological discrepancies. Results are compi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a weekly “Edits”  report that is forwarded 
to study personnel , so th ey can fix errors or  request by[CONTACT_117355]  (see Instructions, below)  
. 
  Instructions: Edit By[CONTACT_860542]  
 
1. Open the MS Excel document attached to the weekly “Edits” report.  
 
2. Resize c olumns , as needed, to view all of the data . Codes are as follows:  
 Visits: 0=Screen/Enroll | 1=Visit 1 | 2=Visit 2 | 3=Delivery/Post Delivery.  
 Edit checks: 1=Missing | 2=N/A | 3=Out of Range | 4=Dependent | 5=Illogical.  
 
3. For each edit, fix on REDCap  OR request a by[CONTACT_860543] 3 columns  for that item 
on the report  
 By[CONTACT_860544]  – date of request  
 By[CONTACT_860545]  – 1= correct as is (for range checks only) | 2 = missi ng forever | 3=other, specify  
 By[CONTACT_860546] – required for by[CONTACT_860547] 3; otherwise optional  
 
4. If you are requesting any by[CONTACT_117355], return the report to the DCC by [CONTACT_860548]. By[CONTACT_860549], while you continue to work on other edits. 
Edits that are by[CONTACT_860550] s. 
 
The DCC compi[INVESTIGATOR_860503] , to help them  track progress and identify 
potential problems that could affect data quality,  including:  
 “Accrual and Retention” – the number of participants who have completed each phase of the  
study (screening, randomization, delivery) or been withdrawn.  
 “Forms Status ” – a comparison of forms expected versus  complete d, pending completion, 
missed, or delinquent  (neither received nor reported  missing)  
 “Events” – the number of adverse events, serious adverse events, and protocol 
deviations/violations  reported  in recent weeks  
 “Edits  Status” – the number of edits identified i n the last week , and how many have been 
resolved  
 
Finally,  the DCC conducts  monitoring visits annually to monitor the quali ty of data collection processes  
and assess security of confidential records and informed consent procedures. DCC personnel review 
documentation, observe operations, and interview study personnel to verify that:  
 human subjects’ rights are being protected;  
 conduct is in compliance with the currently approved protocol; and  
 study data are accurate, complete and verifiable from source documentation.  
 
A subset (10%) of participant records is randomly selected for thorough auditing . Site visit reports are 
sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_860504].  
 
8.3. Data Freezes  
 
The DCC freezes datasets, as well as the programs used to import them into SAS, at least once a month, 
for future reference.

Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version  7.0, Rev. 9/22/2017 )  Page 24 of 27 8.4. Reporting  
 
The DCC produces internal reports to keep study personnel informed about  progress , data quality,  and 
outcomes.  Reports are distributed by [CONTACT_54769]/or at monthly team meetings. Examples include:  
 
 Accrual and Retention – summary of participants by [CONTACT_41900], including screened, eligibl e, consented, 
completed first sleep study, randomized, completed second study, withdrawn, and delivered; 
distributed at monthly SOAP team meetings.  
 
 Visit window closing  – list of participant s with a visit window closing in the next week; emailed  
weekly  to SOAP team  
 
 Delivery specimen reports:  information about collection of cord blood DNA and plasma, placental 
biopsies, and placenta; emailed after delivery to Marcia Gallagher and Ron Jaffe . 
 
 Withdrawal report: reminder to update EHRs and cancel any outstan ding orders for participants 
who are withdrawn; emailed to SOAP team after withdrawal.  
 
The DCC  also prepares bi-annual  reports for the IDSMB, in consultation with the PI. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_84946]:  
 study progress, including an assessment of data quality  
 enrollment , screen failures, and outcomes  
 adverse and serious adverse events  
 protocol deviations/violations and modifications  
 
In closed IDSMB  reports, data are reported by [CONTACT_2939] (i.e., active CPAP versus sham . 
 
IDSMB  reports are submitted annually to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_860505].  
 
Upon completion of the study, the DCC will make deidentified data  and appropriate documentation 
available to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

Sleep -Disordered Breathing, Obesity and Pregnancy , Protocol 2  (SOAP 2) 
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page 3 of 24 2. Study Overview  
 
Part 2 of the Sleep -Disordered Breathing, Obesity and Pregnancy  Study  (SOAP 2) is the continuation of a 
prospective observational study of the interplay between sleep -disordered breathing (SDB), obesity and 
cardiovascular risk factors in pregnancy. Our central hypothesis is that SDB is an effect modifier that 
increases maternal cardiovascular risk and plac ental hypoxic injury in obese pregnant women, and that 
CPAP treatment during pregnancy results in an improved cardiovascular risk and placental profile. To 
test this hypothesis, our cohort includes obese women with and without SDB. Refer to the table below  
and sections 1.1 -1.4 for a discussion of the protocol. Modifications to this protocol are made only with 
approval from the IRB and IDSMB . 
 
After a screening process, e ligible p articipants  are scheduled for two clinic visits, one during the second  
trimeste r (14-20 6/7 weeks)  and the other during  third trimester  (28-31 6/7 weeks) . Each visit begins 
with a questionnaire followed by [CONTACT_860518] (PSG). The following morning , clinical 
measurements are taken, maternal bloods are collected, a uterin e artery Doppler is  performed , and 
non-invasive cardiac output monitoring (NICOM) is performed to measure cardiac function and output.  
 
Participants with severe apnea at the first clinic visit (i.e., AHI estimate ≥ 50) are withdrawn from the 
study. Those w ithout SDB (i.e., AHI estimate < 5) are assigned to a control group for observation only. 
Participants  with SDB  (i.e., AHI estimate 5 -49) are randomly assigned to receive CPAP or general sleep 
hygiene information . CPAP units  include a modem that transmits data back to the study team. Data 
collection points a nd related forms a re discussed in Chapter 5.

5.1. Recruitment and Screening  
 
To identify potential participants  for the SOAP2  study , the rese arch assistant  (RA) reviews prenatal 
medical records on the EPIC system  and approaches w omen who meet basic  inclusion criteria (i.e., aged 
18 or older, 6 -20 weeks pregnant, and obese) during their  prenatal appointments to ascertain their 
Sleep -Disordered Breathing, Obesity and Pregnancy , Protocol 2  (SOAP 2) 
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page [ADDRESS_1199631]. This requires cooperation from the healthcare provider and his/her staff, so the PI [INVESTIGATOR_860513].  
 
Meanwhile, some women find out about the study on their own t hrough Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me (pi[INVESTIGATOR_860514].org), a 
searchable database designed for  individuals who are interested in getting involved in research ; flyers or 
pamphlets posted throughout Magee -Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MWH); a  slide displayed on the plasma screens 
in the lobby [CONTACT_860526]; or w ord of mouth.  If they decide to contact [CONTACT_3476], they are 
prescreened in person or by [CONTACT_648].  
 
The RA maintains a list of individuals who identify themselves or are approached and follows up with 
those who are interested during subsequent prenatal vi sits until a  formal  screening visit takes place . 
Repeated contact [CONTACT_860527] . 
 
During the formal screening visit, the RA confirms that the individua l has not already been screened 
during this pregnancy or enrolled during a previous pregnancy long enough to complete the first sleep 
study, both of which are exclusion criteria. Next, a study ID is generated  (see instructions, below) and a 
Screening (SC) form is completed, in person or by [CONTACT_648], to review  the other exclusion criteria:  
 A history of sleep apnea, insomnia, diabetes, heart disease, or lupus  
 Prior use of a CPAP device  
 Use of a breathing machine at night  
 Currently pregnant with twins or higher o rder multiples (criterion added 6/1/15)  
 Use of a sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_860486]: ID Generation  
 
1. Create a new record on the electroni c data entry system (REDCap). A record ID (e.g., 81) will be 
automatically generated. Add [ADDRESS_1199632] part of the SOAP2 ID . If 
REDCap is not accessible, refer to the clinical data management tool developed by [CONTACT_860557] 4 -digit number.  
2. Add a dash (“ -“) followed by [CONTACT_2299]’s first and last initial s (using capi[INVESTIGATOR_1791]) to create 
her ID (e.g., 2 081-AH). 
 
The SC is based on self -report; the RA does not refer to medical records or other sources to verify the 
accuracy of participant resp onses.  
 
If the individual is found to be eligible, additional information is collected about sleep characterization 
and then details about the study are provided, including the timeline, the randomization process, 
potential risks and benefits, and the impo rtance of compliance. Prior to seeking informed consent, 
which must be done in person, the RA reminds the individual that there is no obligation to participate or 
penalty for declining to participate, and that her care will not be compromised if she choose s not to 
participate or enrolls and subsequently leaves the study. Prospective participants must sign the consent 
form in order to proceed . The consent process is documented on the Consent Documentation form . 
 
If informed consent is obtained, Contact [CONTACT_63027] (CI) is collected on a paper form and stored in a 
secure place at the study office; it is not entered into the electronic data entry system (REDCap). Next, 
an Initial Interview (II) is completed with questions about lifestyle, use of medications, pr ior 
pregnancies, and medical history, and self -reported estimated gestational age is confirmed by [CONTACT_860558] -Disordered Breathing, Obesity and Pregnancy , Protocol 2  (SOAP 2) 
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page 10 of 24 the participant’s medical record. Finally, the participant is given a 7 -day Sleep Log (SL) along with 
instructions about how to record bedtimes, wak e-up times, naps, and other information. Participants 
are expected to bring the completed SL when they come for Clinic Visit 1, which takes place 14 -20 6/[ADDRESS_1199633] one week before then.  
 
5.2. Clinic Visit s: PSG, Maternal Bloods, Uterine Artery Doppler  
 
There are two overnight clinic visits, one scheduled during the second trimester (14 -20 6/7 weeks EGA) 
and the other during the third trimester (28 -31 6/7 EGA). Both take place at the Sleep and Behavioral 
Neuroscien ce Center (SBNC, formerly the Neuroscience Clinical and Translational Research Center) at 
Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic (WPIC, part of UPMC) . The instructions below are consistent with 
orders prescribed by [CONTACT_978] (see Appendix).  
 
Prior to the each  visit, the Study Coordinator  review s the participant’s medical record to identify any 
medications that have been prescribed as well as diagnoses or symptoms that could affect her 
participation. Participants receive a reminder by [CONTACT_648], text, or email (bas ed on personal preferences 
noted on the Contact [CONTACT_465470]) of the coming visit and instructions to bring all medications with 
them. This is especially important for participants with hypertension. For the first visit, participants are 
also instructe d to bring their completed Sleep Log (SL).  
 
Each clinic visit begins in the evening when the participant arrives at the SBNC , usually 7 -8PM. 
Components include:  
 Collection of the Sleep Log (SL) (Visit 1 only). The participant receives the SL from the Resea rch 
Assistant during screening, completes it on paper, and returns it to the SBNC . 
 Administration of a Sleep Questionnaire (SQ). The SQ covers general work and sleep patterns, sleep 
habits, snoring and sleep apnea. It is administered online. SBNC  personnel  complete the first part 
and the participant completes the rest. SBNC  personnel are permitted to provide assistance, if 
requested by [CONTACT_2299], but should not rephrase questions.  Prior to submitting, SBNC 
personnel  are asked to review the form for co mpleteness and encourage the participant to fill in any 
blanks.  
 Initiation  of the Sleep Study  (SS) form. Weight is measured (this is not self -reported) and, after at 
least five minutes of rest, blood pressure is measured three times, with five minutes betw een 
measurements. Any readings >140/[ADDRESS_1199634].  
 “Wire up.” Small electrodes are placed on the participant’s scalp, face, and legs so that technologists 
can monitor her air flow, body movements, heart rate, and oxygen saturation while she sleeps.  
 Comple tion of the Sleep Study (SS)  form. During the night, SBNC  personnel review the participant’s 
polysomnography (PSG) data to calculate an a pnea -hypopnea index ( AHI) estimate, using AASM 
[ADDRESS_1199635] visit determines eligibility for randomization (see below). If 
a sleep study is not completed successfully – either because a participant refuses or there is a 
medical reason or technical problem – SBNC  personnel should report this on the SSA a nd also notify 
the Study Coordinator. (Note: sleep studies are formally scored later on but these scores are 
recorded on the SBNC's  “Harmony System,” not REDCap.)  
 Randomization ( Visit 1 only ). Participants with an AHI estimate 5 -49 and who agree to be 
rand omized are randomized by [CONTACT_860559]  (see “Randomization,” below). For those randomized to CPAP, t he assignment 
date, unit number, mask type, and other details a re recorded on Group As signment (GRP) form, and 
Sleep -Disordered Breathing, Obesity and Pregnancy , Protocol 2  (SOAP 2) 
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page 11 of 24 use and care instructions, included in the case, are presented. For those randomized to Sleep 
Hygiene, general information is provided.  
 Clinical measurements,  maternal  bloodwork , uterine artery ultrasound  and NICOM data . After the 
PSG, participants are escorted by [CONTACT_860530]. Clinical measurements 
(vitals, height, weight and waist, hip and neck circumference) are taken using the SOAP2  Tanita 
Protocol (see Appendix), along with three measures of blood pressur e, and recorded on the Clinical 
Measurement (CM) form ; fasting blood is drawn for cardiovascular risk profiles and documented on 
the Maternal Blood (MB) form; and a  uterine artery (UA) Doppler is performed . Blood is processed 
and then stored for future batched testing.  Non -invasive cardiac output monitoring (NICOM) is 
performed to measure cardiac function and output over a small interval of time (5 -10 minutes).  
 The Study Coordinator also takes this opportunity to review the Sleep Log,  to see  if there are  any 
unusual responses, and the Sleep Questionnaire, to see if any responses are missing , askin g the 
participant for clarification or additional information, as appropriate . In addition, during visit 2, the 
Study Coordinator asks  CPAP participants  whether all of the equipment is the same as what was 
originally issued and confirms that all components are still correctly labeled.  
 
At the SBNC, e ating is permitted until midnight. After midnight, only water is permitted until after 
fasting blood has been collec ted in the morning. Ideally, participants are asleep by 11PM but no specific 
good night time (GNT) has been established for the study.  
 
An AHI estimate is calculated at both visits. At Visit 1, the AHI estimate determines group assignment 
(see 5.3, below).  At Visit 2, participants who are in the Control Group and who have an AHI estimate of [ADDRESS_1199636] (documented by [CONTACT_860531] a "note to 
file).  
 
Data are entered directly into REDCap, using the study laptop at the SBNC . If REDCap is not accessible, 
SBNC  personnel enter data on a paper form and then give the paper form to the Study Coordinator the 
following morning so that the data can be entered into REDCap  and/or visually verified, if it has already 
been entered by [CONTACT_221774]. Visual verification is required for all forms completed on paper and is done by a 
different staff person or at least a day later, if done by [CONTACT_860532].  
 
5.3. Group Assignment and Randomization  
 
A participant’s AHI estimate from the first clinic visit determines whether she is randomized, assigned to 
the control group for observation only, or withdrawn from the study.  Participants with an AHI estimate 
below [ADDRESS_1199637] and withdrawn from the study. They are not 
randomized.  Participants with an AHI estimate 5 -49 who agree to randomization are randomized by [CONTACT_860560], based on a system developed by [CONTACT_15791] (see below) .

important not to skip any numbers.  
2) Prior to opening the envelope, confirm that it is Visit 1, the participant is willing to be 
randomized, and her AHI estimate is 5 -49. 
3) Open the envelope  to reveal her randomization assignment  and then follow the prescribed 
script, documenting the process as directed  on the Group A ssignment (GRP) form, on REDCap.  
4) File the randomization assignment sheet in the participant's research study folder, as source 
documentation.  
 
5.4. CPAP Equipment  
 
The Clinical Team  is responsible for obtaining CPAP machines with cases and modems  and labeling them 
with circuit numbers (C200 -C236) . The coordinator brings the units to the SBNC  for distribution to 
eligible participants at Clinic Visit 1.  
 
Each CPAP unit has a built -in hard drive that stores up to six months of data, a removable memor y card 
that stores up to one year of data, and a modem configured to transmit data electronically. Data are 
transmitted to a secure, password -protected website (encoreanywhere.com) and are reviewed regularly 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_860490] (see 
“Participant Compensation,” below). Data are accurate in real time only if modems are working 
properly. Otherwise, there may be a lag until data from the memory cards are transmitted.  
 
5.5. Home Visit  and Weekly Calls/Texts  
 
CPAP participants are scheduled for a follow -up Home Visit (HV) by [CONTACT_860533]. There is no defined window but, ideally, the visit occurs within two 
weeks of randomization. Ad ditional visits may be scheduled, if needed. In addition to the home visit, the 
Research Assistant  attempts to contact [CONTACT_860534], text and/or email, depending on 
preferences recorded on the Contact [CONTACT_7171] (CI) form, to remind them t o continue to use their 
CPAP machine.  
 
Sleep Hygiene participants do not have a Home Visit but they receive monthly reminders, by [CONTACT_648], text 
and/or email, depending on preferences recorded on the Contact [CONTACT_7171] (CI) form.

Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page 13 of 24 5.6. Delivery/Post -Delivery  
 
To ensure that Magee is prepared for SOAP deliveries, the  Study Coordinator uses UPMC 's Augr website 
to report medical record numbers (MRNs) of patients who are participating in the study, adding new 
enrollees and removing those who have already delivered or  been  withdrawn. In addition, she emails 
the same information directly to the Magee  Obstetric Sterile Processing Unit (OSPU) , as a backup 
measure . At delivery, cord blood  is collected, placental biopsies are taken , and the placenta is sent to 
the Pathology Department,  as documented  by [CONTACT_860561] (DS) form. If the 
OSPU is not staffed at the time of delivery , or the participant delivers at a non -study  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , it is 
possible that specimen will not be  collected . 
 
The Pathology Department  prepares and stores slides of the placenta for future analysis by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Parks, a 
study co -PI. Cord blood and plasma are stored by [CONTACT_860536], for possible future analysis.  
 
For randomized participants , the Study C oordinator documents IDSMB  Outcomes (D0), admi nister s the 
Apnea  Survey ( AP), and collects the CPAP machine , if one was issued . 
 
Within four weeks of delivery, a Chart Abstraction (CA) is completed to document  lab results and other 
data related to admission and delivery, labor, maternal complications d uring pregnancy, postpartum 
complications, pregnancy outcomes, neo natal care, infant status, etc. CAs are completed by a  trained 
chart abstractor. Prior to entry into REDCap, the following CAs must be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Facco:  
 All CPAP participants  
 For non CP AP participants:  
- If delivery occurred before 34 weeks  
- If Yes to any part of section 4 
- If Yes to 6.1, 6.2 or 6.4 
- If Yes to any part of section 10  
- If Yes to any part of section 16 
 
5.7. Participant Compensation  
 
All participants are eligible to receive up to $550 for completing the following procedures:  
 PSG (clinic visits 1 and 2): $150 x 2 = $300  
 Maternal bloods (clinic visits 1 and 2): $50 x 2 = $100  
 Uterine artery Doppler (clinic visits 1 and 2): $75 x 2 = $150  
 
In addition, randomized participants are elig ible for the following payments:  
 Apnea  survey ( delivery/post -delivery ): $25  
 CPAP compliance incentive (for CPAP participants only): $10/week 0F1 
 CPAP return (for CPAP participants only) (delivery/post -delivery): $40  
 
The Clinical Team  uses the web -based WePay™ card payment system to disburse payments to 
participants. In addition, free parking is provided at Magee and WPIC, for sleep studies.

6.1. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events , including Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes  
 
Over the course of any study, there is always a risk of an adverse event , defined as the unintended 
worsening  of a participant’s signs or symptoms . AEs are characterized in terms of study -relatedness, 
expectedness, and seriousness.  
 
The SOAP2  informed consent form includes a list of AEs considered  both “study related” and 
“expected ”: 
 Minor discomfort associated with wearing the belt, nasal cannula and /or finger pulse oximeter  
during the ApneaLink Home Sleep Monitoring  
 Mild bleeding, bruising, and/or soreness (infrequent ; occurs in 1% -10% of people) during blood 
draws. Other risks include f ainting  and/ or infection ( rare; occurs in less than 1%)  
 Rash or chafing at the site of the monitors, probes and/or electrodes during the PSGs  
 Brief and/or minor discomfort associated with CPAP use  (e.g.,  minor skin discomfort from the 
mask , nasal stuffiness, runny nose, nosebleed, eye discomfort ) 
 Rash or chafing  at the site of the uterine arte ry Doppler abdominal US probe  
 
For this study, adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) are also considered “expected,” even though they 
are not on the informed consent form, because they can, theoretically, happen in any pregnancy . 
Examples include  miscarriage, preterm birth, se vere  growth restriction, intrauterine fetal demise, and 
neonatal death before discharge.  To determine whether APOs are study -related requires unmasking so 
this is handled by [CONTACT_68401]  (see below).  
 
An AE is considered serious if:  
 it is life threatening;  
 it results in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged), or disability or permanent damage; or  
 an intervention is required to prevent permanent impairment/damage.  
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that are un expected and related, or possibly related, to the study must be 
reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_860492] 24 hours after 
discovery. SAE reporting is done online through the HRPO’s OSIRIS electronic submission s ystem.  
 
Meanwhile, e very non-APO SAE, irrespective of relatedness and expectedness , must be reported by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_860493], within 48 hours of discovery.  
 
Miscarriages are documented on a Withdrawal (WD) form; all other APOs  are documented during Chart 
Abstraction (CA) following  delivery . For CPAP participants, APOs are also documented on the  IDSMB  
Outcomes (DO) form . All other AEs are documented on Adverse Event (AE) form s. AE and APO data are 
pulled for weekly internal “Event s” reports and are also included in bi -annual reports to the IDSMB . 
IDSMB  reports are unmasked so that members can determine study -relatedness  and consider whether 
the study needs to be modified or even term inated . Documentation and reporting requirements are 
summarized in the Diagram  1, below .

6.2. Protocol Violations  and Deviatio ns 
 
Protocol violations are defined as departures from accepted clinical research practices or SOAP2  Study  
protocol or procedures that pose a risk to participant safety, adversely affect data quality and the 
integrity of the major scientific goals of the study, and/or involve a significant and repeated breach of 
participants’ privacy. Protocol violations inclu de, but are not limited to:  
 failure to obtain or document informed consent prior to study procedures  
 randomization of an ineligible participant  
 assignment  of incorrect CPAP unit  
 failure to report serious adverse events appropriately  
 breach  of confidential ity  
 
By [CONTACT_860537], protocol violations are considered the most serious class of departure 
from the study protocol.  
 
All protocol violations must be reported on a Protocol Deviation/Violation Form (PD). In addition, within 
seven days, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_860494], indicating how the problem has been/will be Is the AE an APO?

study, and do not involve a significant and repeated breach of participant privacy. Protocol deviations 
include, b ut are not limited to:  
 failure to obtain appropriate source documentation  
 mistimed procedures or visit (e.g., conducting a clinic visit outside of  the window outlined in the 
protocol)  
 failure to collect a specimen or perform a test specified in the Protoco l 
 administrative error  
 
All protocol deviations must be reported on a Protocol Deviation/Violation Form (PD). If a pattern of 
repeated protocol deviations emerges and it appears that data quality could be compromised or 
participant safety jeopardized, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_860496] a protocol 
violation applies.  
 
6.3. Withdrawals  
 
Participants can withdraw or be withdrawn at any time. No further data are  collected after the date of 
withdrawal but data already collected for study purposes, including biological samples, remain in the 
database and are used for analysis . Withdrawals are recorded on the Withdrawal (WD) form and 
included in reports compi[INVESTIGATOR_860497] -annual IDSMB  meetings.  
 
In addition to the reasons listed on the WD, missing Clinic Visit [ADDRESS_1199642]  at that visit . After randomization, intention to treat principles apply, i.e., 
participants remain in the study for observation even if they are unable to complete one or more 
components of the study  or CPAP needs to be discontinued .

Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page 18 of 24 7. Data Collection  
 
Study personnel are expected to enter all data directly into the SOAP2  electronic data entry system 
(REDCap) at the time of c apture. The only exceptions are the Contact  [CONTACT_7171] (CI) form and Home 
Visit (HV) form which are  completed  only  on paper and not entered into REDCap , as well as the Sleep 
Log (SL) and Chart Abstraction  (CA), which are  completed on paper prior to being entered into REDCap . 
 
A complete set of forms are included in the Appendix, for reference, along with instructions and the 
SOAP2  REDCap User Guide.  
 
7.1. Self-Assessments  
 
Forms marked as “ Participant ” in the table of forms are self-assessments (e.g., Sleep Questionnaire) . 
Study personnel are permitted to provide technical assistance  to help participants complete this form , 
including reading the fo rm to them and recording responses on their behalf, but shoul d not rephrase  
questions . 
 
After a participant completes a self -assessment , study p ersonnel  are expected to  review the form for 
completeness  and, if any field is blank, attempt to obtain  a response  from the participant . 
 
If a participant refuses to complete a self -assessment form, study personnel should off er assistance and 
enco uragement . If these attempts fail, a Missing Form (MF) form should be completed  (see below).  
 
7.2. Other Forms  
 
Aside from the self -assessment form , all other  forms are completed by [CONTACT_3462] , including 
interview -based forms (e.g. , SC, II ), procedure  forms (e.g., MB, UA), and administrative form s (e.g., AE , 
PD). 
 
With interview -based forms, study personnel should follow the prompts but are permitted to rephrase 
questions, if necessary, to obtain valid responses from participants . 
 
7.3. Paper Forms  and Visu al Verification  
 
The DCC provides study personnel  with printable PDFs of blank forms, as a backup, in case REDCap  is not 
accessible. The participant’s ID must be written on every page, along with any other header fields (e.g., 
form date , staff initials). Paper form s should be stored securely at study sites, to protect participants’ 
confidentiality , and separate from any identifying information (e.g., names, medical record numbers) . 
The DCC reviews paper forms during site visits (see “Data Quality,” below).  
 
If a response on a paper forms needs to be changed, the original response should be crossed out and 
the new response written beside it, along with the initials of the staff person inputting the change and 
the date of the change. If there is a correspondin g electronic version , that should be updated, too. 
REDCap automatically tracks  who makes changes and when they are made  so that information does not 
need to be entered online.

hours later.  If the SBNC has to complete a form on paper and doesn't have an opportunity to verify it, 
the form should be  given to the Study Coordinator for verification.  
 
7.4. Missed Visits  and Missing Forms  
 
If a participant misses a  visit and there is no opportunity to reschedule  within the window  (e.g., SBNC  
has no makeup appointments available ), or the participant attends a visit but one or more forms is not 
completed during the visit,  the Clinical Team is  expected to complete a  Missed Visit (MV) or Missing 
Form (MF) f orm, as appropriate . The purpose of documenting missed and incomplete visits is to alert 
the DCC not to expect data. A missed or incomplete visit that meets the criteria for a protocol deviation 
should also be documented on a PD form.  
 
7.5. Missing Data Codes  
 
In general, fields should not be left blank on a data collection form. Instead, the following missing data 
codes should be used:  
Description  Date Value  Time 
Value  Numeric 
Value  Character 
Value  
Not applicable  2/2/1802  98:00:00  -2 N/A 
Participant does not know  3/3/1803  97:00:00  -3 Unk 
Participant refuses to answer  4/4/1804  96:00:00  -4 Ref 
Missing forever (e.g., test not done, result not in 
chart, question left blank and opportunity to 
respond has passed)  5/5/1805  95:00:00  -5 ND 
Below the level of detection  N/A 94:00:00  -6 BLD 
Above the level of quantification  N/A 93:00:00  -7 ALQ

Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page 20 of 24 8. Data Management  
 
The Clinical Team  uses an internal system (“Jack’s system”) t o manage clinical data, including keepi[INVESTIGATOR_860498] . The DCC has access to this system, too, but generally uses it only to 
prepare a monthly report for the Magee obstetric sterile processing unit (OSPU) of participants who 
have not delivered yet.  
 
CPAP data, stored online at encoreanywhere.com, are reviewed  regularly  by [CONTACT_860562].  
 
The SBNC  uses the Harmony System to manage clinical data, including formal AHI scores.  
 
Management of  all research data  is handled by [CONTACT_15791] . Responsibilities include developi[INVESTIGATOR_860515], training personnel in data collection and entry procedures, creating SAS 
programs to import data from REDCap , compi[INVESTIGATOR_860501], and overseeing regulatory reporting.  
 
Refer to Chapter 9 for information about Data Collection.  
 
8.1. Data Privac y and Security  
 
Study personnel are expected to maintain the security and confidentiality of participant data . To this 
end, three  folders are maintained for each participant’s paper documents , all of which are stored in 
separate locked cabinets : 
 A folder f or documents that refer to her only by [CONTACT_860539], with no identifiable data ( i.e., most of 
the study forms )  
 A folder for documents that refer to her by [CONTACT_860540] ( e.g., 
II, CA (which includes admission and discharge date s), requests for appointments at the  SBNC  (which 
include appointment date)  
 A folder for documents that include her  name ( e.g., CI, ultrasounds, requests for ultrasound 
appointments)  
 
Receipts for payments and  compliance (which are identifie d by [CONTACT_40337]), meanwhile, are kep t in a 
separate locked cabinet . 
 
Some identifiable data is stored on the electronic data system (REDCap) but access is restricted to 
authorized users with appropriate credentials. D ata extracted by [CONTACT_15791], meanwhile, are stored in 
secure password -protected servers maintained by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_9109].  
 
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_860516]-approved consent procedures, participant records must 
be destroyed seven years after the completion of the study.  
 
8.2. Data Quality  
 
Data quality begins with training  in data collection and entry procedures  conducted by [CONTACT_860541].

Edits tha t are by[CONTACT_860563].  
 
The DCC compi[INVESTIGATOR_860503] , to help them  track progress and identify 
potential problems that could affect data quality,  including:  
 “Accrual and Retention” – the number of participants who have completed each phase of the 
study (screening, randomization, delivery) or been withdrawn.  
 “Forms Status ” – a comparison of forms expected versus  complete d, pending completion, 
missed, or delinquent  (neither received no r reported  missing)  
 “Events” – the number of adverse events, serious adverse events, and protocol 
deviations/violations  reported  in recent weeks  
 “Edits  Status” – the number of edits identified i n the last week , and how many have been 
resolved  
 
Monitoring is not conducted for this study.  
 
8.3. Data Freezes  
 
The DCC freezes datasets, as well as the programs used to import them into SAS, at least once a month, 
for future reference.  
 
8.4. Reporting  
 
The DCC produces internal reports to keep study personnel informed about  progress , data quality,  and 
outcomes.  Reports are distributed by [CONTACT_54769]/or at monthly team meetings. Examples include:  
 
Sleep -Disordered Breathing, Obesity and Pregnancy , Protocol 2  (SOAP 2) 
Manual of Operations and Procedures (Version 3.0, Rev.  09/22 /17)  Page 22 of 24  Accrual and Retention – summary of participants by [CONTACT_41900], including screened, eligible, consented, 
completed first sleep study , randomized, completed second study, withdrawn, and delivered; 
distributed at monthly SOAP2  team meetings.  
 
 Visit window closing  – list of participant s with a visit window closing in the next week; emailed  
weekly  to SOAP2  team  
 
 Delivery specimen reports:  information about collection of cord blood DNA and plasma, placental 
biopsies, and placenta; emailed after delivery to Marcia Gallagher and Ron Jaffe . 
 
 Withdrawal report: reminder to update EHRs and cancel any outstanding orders for participants 
who are wi thdrawn; emailed to SOAP2  team after withdrawal.  
 
The DCC  also prepares bi-annual  reports for the IDSMB, in consultation with the PI. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_84946]:  
 study progress, including an assessment of data quality  
 enrollment , screen failures, and outcomes  
 adverse and serious adverse events  
 protocol deviations/violations and modifications  
 
IDSMB  reports are submitted annually to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_860505].  
 
Upon completion of the study, the DCC will make deidentified data  and appropria te documentation 
available to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

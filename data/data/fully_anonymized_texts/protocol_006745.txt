1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Intermittent Hypoxia and Caffeine in Infants Born Preterm (ICAF)  
Study Des cription : 
 
  
 
   
 
   Our proposal will address the critical question: is persisting intermittent 
hypoxia ( IH) in preterm infants associated with biochemical, structural, or 
functional injury, and is this injury attenuated with extended caffeine 
treatment? We will study the effects of caffeine on IH  in 220 preterm infants 
born at ≤30 w eeks + 6 days gestation. Infants who are currently being 
treated with routine caffeine, and who meet eligibility criteria, will be 
enrolled between 32 weeks + 0 days and 36 weeks + [ADDRESS_156979] dose of routine caffeine is given on or before the day the infant is 36 
weeks + [ADDRESS_156980] dose of routine caffeine 
treatment, infants  will be randomized (110/group) to extended caffeine 
treatment or placebo . Randomized infants should  begin recei ving study 
drug (i.e. 5 mg/kg/ of caffeine base, or equal volume of placebo ) on the day 
of randomization , but no later than  the third calendar day following the last 
dose of routine caffeine .  Prior to 36 w eeks + 0 days PMA, study drug will 
be given once daily (i.e. 5mg/kg/day) and beginning at 36 w eeks  + 0 days  
PMA , study drug will be given twice daily (i.e. 10 mg/kg/day) .  The last dose 
of study drug will be given at 42  weeks  + 6 days  PMA. Pulse oximeter

Inflammatory biomarkers will be measured at s tudy enrollment and again 
at 38 weeks + [ADDRESS_156983]. At study sites recruiting 
into the MRI part of the study, q uantitative MR I/MRS should  be obtained 
between  study enrollment and 3 calendar days after starting study drug and 
again at a target date of 43 week s + 0 days, but no later than 46  weeks + 6 
days PMA . 
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective  1: Compare the extent of IH  exposure , from 
randomization through  42 w eeks + 6 days  PMA (within each gestational 
week and overall) , in infants randomized to extended caffeine treatment to  
infants assigned to receive  placebo.    
Primary Objective 2:  Compare changes in a panel of inflammation -related  
cytokines and chemokines , from enrollment to the target age of 38 w eeks 
+ 0 days PMA, in infants randomized to extended caffeine treatment  to 
infants assigned to receive placebo .  
Primary Objective 3: Compare changes in quantitative MRI structural, 
microstructural and metabolic biomarkers of acute injury , from enrollment 
to 43 -46 weeks PMA, in infants randomized to extended caffeine treatment  
to infants assigned to receive placebo .  
Secondary Objective 1: Examine the association between salivary caffeine 
concentrations and IH  outcomes at the one week post randomization and  
40 weeks + 0 days PMA  assessments.  
Secondary Objective 2: Determine whether caffeine effects on changes in 
inflammatory or MRI biomarkers from baseline to follow -up are mediated 
by [CONTACT_138069] -related reduced IH.

Geographic locat ion: NICU or step down unit at a  participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], with 
final weeks at home following NIC U discharge   
Phase:  Not applicable  
 
Description of Sites /Facilities  Enrolling 
Participants:   
Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138005] U.S. While inpatient the research will take place in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Once 
discharged , if the subject has been enrolled at a site performing MRIs,  the 
patient will return to specified outpatient locations for performance of the 
follow -up MRI.  At the end of the study,  study termination procedures will 
be performed in a manner convenient for the family, and may be performed in person or remotely, and if applicable  may be performed at the time of 
an MRI .  
   
Description of Study 
Intervention:  Enrolled infants will be randomized to receive caffeine or equal volume 
placebo. The c affeine base dose will be 5 mg/kg once daily when the infant 
is at age 35 wee ks + 6 days PMA or less. W hen the infant is at 36 weeks + 0 
days PMA or more the caffeine base dose will be 5 mg/kg twice daily , based 
on the expected increased rate  of caffeine metabolism that occurs as 
infants age.   
Study Duration:  Enrollment  is scheduled to  start  in December , [ADDRESS_156984] through May of 202 2, with completion of follow -up and data analyses 
thereafter .

 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 Participant Duration:  The maximum time between study enrollment to study completion for an 
individual participant  would be 15 weeks if enrollment was as early as 32 
weeks + [ADDRESS_156985] time permitted at 46 
weeks + 6 days.   Since enrollment is permitted as late as 36 weeks + 6  days, 
and the final study visit may occur as early as 43 weeks + [ADDRESS_156986] roughly half their time in the s tudy as 
in-patient and half as outpatient, though this may be vary widely.   
 
 
 
The end of study procedures  include: return of the oximeter  (if applicable) , 
salivary  sample and any unused study drug.  As noted above, these 
procedures will be done at the convenience o f the family, and although a 
face -to-visit is preferred,  all items  may  be shipped back if , for any reason, 
the parents prefer not to travel to the site.

 1.2 STUDY SCHEMA  
Our goal is to randomize 220 infants born at a gestational age of 30 weeks + [ADDRESS_156987] dose of routine caffeine treatment between 32 weeks + 0 days and 36 weeks + 5 days PMA , to receive 
either extended caffeine treatment or placebo  to 42 weeks + 6 days .  As illustrated  below, all NICU 
admissions of infants bo rn at 30 weeks + 6 days or less will be noted in the screening log.  Formal screening 
for eligibility will begin at 32 weeks + 0 days, with enrollment once infants meet all eligibility requirements, 
and the infant is at 36 weeks + [ADDRESS_156988] dose of routine caffeine, as long as randomization and dosing is by 
36 weeks + 6 days PMA.   Outcome measures will include oxygen saturation recordings, plasma biomarkers 
and brain MRI.

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
   Caffeine treatment for apnea of prematurity and related intermittent hypoxia (IH)  is almost universal, 
with treatment most commonly discontinued at 33 -35 w eeks PM A.   However, IH  continues to occur in 
infants after routine discontinuation of caffeine, and persists after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. This IH is not 
apparent clinically and accurate detection requires continuous high resolution pulse oximetry recordings . 
Studies confirm that the IH occurring during spontaneous breathing after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_138008] a 
manifestation of immature breathing control. It is unknown if this persistent IH results in acute injury, 
and in particular if extending the duration o f caffeine treatment attenuates or prevents this acute 
injury.  This study will address 3 critical questions: 1) will extending caffeine treatment from 32-35 to 42 
weeks PMA reduce extent of IH, 2) is persisting IH  associated with biochemical, structural, o r functional 
indicators of acute injury, and 3)  does caffeine treatment continued to 42 wee ks PMA attenuate this acute 
injury? This study has the potential to (1) identify early brain injury mediated by [CONTACT_138071], and (2) help inform optimum strategies for later definitive neurodevelopmental assessments based on nature of the acute brain injury. This study thus has high 
potential to justify future neurodevelopmental outcome studies that will further improve outcomes of 
infants born preterm, change clinical practice, and have significant public health benefit.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Acute morbidities can contribute to adverse neurodevelopment outcomes in preterm infants born at ≤30 
weeks gestation, but neural damage occurring after resolution of acute morbidities may be more subtle 
and related to cycles of inflammation and repair in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866]. One possible contributor to these 
more subtle injuries is intermittent hypoxia (IH) , defined as repetitive cycles of hypoxia and re -
oxygenation, which occur commonly in convalesc ing premature infants. Caffeine treatment can improve 
both motor and cognitive neurodevelopmental outcome in premature infants, especially at higher doses, 
but m echanisms are unclear .1-8 The Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP)  Trial in infants born preterm 
at <1250 g reported 1)  shorter duration of positive pressure ventilation and reduced rate of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in infants treated with caffeine during the early postnatal w eeks prior 
to 34 -35 w eeks postmenstrual age (PMA), 2) improved motor function and reduced rates of 
developmental coordination disorder at 5 years, and 3) diffusion changes by [CONTACT_138072].7,9,10,[ADDRESS_156996] link between IH and motor, cognitive and language impairment  
at 18 months corrected age (adjusted risk gradient p<0.005).[ADDRESS_156997] risk gradient was at 
postnatal ages 9 -10 w eeks, consistent with a contributory role of later IH  present after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_138009]. T hese data emphasize the potential importance of recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_138010] , as 
convalescing infants approach term -equivalent age, on later cognitive, language and motor impairments.    
   Studies confirm that IH during the early postnatal w eeks of life in ve ry preterm infants may be due to 
other  mechanisms, including ineffective ventilation or other acute morbidities. However, IH in 
  Page 11 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 spontaneously breathing convalescing infants is due to ventilatory immaturity with associated respi[INVESTIGATOR_138011], and has a characteristic pattern of brief desaturation from a normoxic baseline  
followed by [CONTACT_138073].13-18 Our study will assess IH  only during spontaneous 
breathing in infants after resolution of acute morbidities or need for supplemental O 2, and approaching 
term -equivalent age, a time when IH  has been shown by [CONTACT_138074] i mmature 
breath ing regulation.  
   IH during spontaneous breathing related to ventilatory immaturity requires continuous high resolution 
pulse oximetry recordings for detection, and consists of brief, repetitive cycles of O 2 desaturation from a 
normoxic base line, followed by [CONTACT_138075]. These repetitive cycles of reoxygenation 
following each IH  epi[INVESTIGATOR_138012] -inflammatory and cause oxidative stress, free radical production, and 
release of pro -inflammatory cytokines.19,20 Studies show incr eased levels of inflammatory biomarkers in 
animal models of IH-associated obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) and in human subjects with OSA.19,21- [ADDRESS_156998] been associated with significant neurocognitive 
morbidity.23,24  Worrisome evidence from animal models also shows that IH has significant and long lasting 
effects on multiple physiological control mechanisms20-24,35 -40 and neurological outcomes.41-43 We 
hypothesize that persistent IH in spontaneously  breathing preterm infants after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_138013].            
   The relationship between IH , adenosine, caffeine and brain development is complex and not fully 
understood. At clinically effective doses, caffeine exerts effects in the brain by [CONTACT_138076] (Ado ) 
A1 and A2A receptors, resulting in respi[INVESTIGATOR_138014], vigilance and 
arousal.44-60 Ado A1 receptor activation contributes to hypoxia -induced reduction in cerebral myelination 
and ventriculomegaly. Caffeine treatment attenuate s the effects of hypoxia, presumably through 
blockade of Ado A1 receptors.45,58,59 It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that similar mechanisms may be 
active in the human preterm infant. Caffeine may thus be neuroprotective  through two major 
mechanisms: 1)  reducing incidence and severity of IH due to its respi[INVESTIGATOR_138015], and 2) 
reducing pre - and immature oligodendrocyte  injury.  
   Brain development progresses through a highly programmed series of events.61-64 Myelination in the 
cerebral hemispheres begins to accelerate at ~30 -32 w eeks and continues to term and beyond, and 
disturbances in these late gestation developmental processes often result in failure of normal brain 
growth, abnormal cortical organization,  impaired myelination, and connectivity, commonly observed in 
surviving preterm infants.64-75 Persisting IH thus has even greater potential for later neurodevelopmental 
  Page 12 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: [ADDRESS_156999]  step in understanding acute injury from IH, we address a fundamental and 
critically important question with high potential public health benefit: does continued caffeine treatment 
after receiving the last dose of  routine caffeine between 32 weeks + 0 days  PMA and 36 weeks and 5 
days PMA reduce ext ent of IH and attenuate indicators of acute injury at 43 -44 w eeks PMA? We will 
assess injury in 4 domains: biochemical (inflammation), structural (MRI), functional and metabolic (MRS). 
Our proposed study thus has the potential to have major impacts on clin ical practice: 1)  how clinicians 
assess and interpret IH,  and 2) duration of pharmacological t reatment with caffeine.  This will be the first 
study in human infants to assess the effects of continuing caffeine treatment in attenuating acute injury 
indicato rs associated with IH .  
2.2.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
• Study drug:  Caffeine  is one of the most frequently used medications in the NICU for infants born very 
preterm . At the time of enrollment,  infants will be tolerating routine caffeine treatment without any 
adverse clinical effects .  However, known potential side effects of caffeine , would  include:  
o Transient decreased weight gain  
o Tachycardia  
o Gastrointestinal symptoms , including feeding intolerance  
o Jitteriness    
o Hypertension  
Each of these side effects would be  expected in fewer than 5% of participants . 
• Pulse oximeter recordings : Pulse oximetry is routinely used in the NICU and sometimes also 
indicated for home use. The study oximeter will be in addition to the comparable oximeter 
routinely used clinically. We will follow routine clinical routines for frequent site relocation of the 
oximeter sensor s (probes), to decrease the risk of  significant skin irritation.  
• Blood  sampling for inflammatory biomarkers :  There will be 2 blood samples obtained, one at 
enrollment and the 2nd prior to NICU discharge, and the blood volume for each sampling will be <1 ml. Whenever possible, these blood samples will be obtained as part of a clinically indicated 
routine heel stick or venipuncture, thus decreasing  the need to cause infant discomfort beyond 
that required for routine clinical management.  
• Brain MRI : All MRIs performed for this study will be done without sedation, th us eliminating the most 
important  potential risk beyond that associated with a clinically -indicated brain MRI .  However , the 
time required for each study MRI will be more than that required for a routine brain MRI .   
• Salivary samples : The [ADDRESS_157000] not been associated with any infant discomfort or parental concern.   
• Loss of confidentiality  is also a potential risk. However, all demographic and clinical information will 
be entered in a secure password -protected database accessible only to the research staff at that 
  Page 13 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 clinical site and the data coordinating center (DCC) at [LOCATION_011] University Medical Center. Clinical site 
research staff will enter data via web access. Identifiers that have been collected will be stored 
separately from research data. The data will be in a separate locked/password protected database 
linked only by a subject ID number. Identifiers collected for the purpose of performing follow -up will 
be stored in a separate database that will be destroyed after the study is completed. The data will be 
split as it is loaded; personal identifiers (names, addresses, telephone numbers) will be entered into the tracking database along with a unique numeric identifier, and other data (excluding the participants' names and address) will be stored in the analytic database. It will be possible to link information in these two databases only through a coded numeric identifier; it will not be possible to identify individual participants in the analytic database. The separation of names and addresses from personal data adds an important level of se curity and helps to assure that participant confidentiality 
will be maintained. Follow -up data will be processed in a similar manner. The analytic database will 
contain no identifiers and will be the exclusive source for all data analyses performed at the DCC.

• Recurrence of A pnea -related symptoms in placebo -treated subjects : We have not observed any 
recurrent apnea -related symptoms in preliminary studies after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_138018] .18,[ADDRESS_157001] dose of s tudy drug at 42 w eeks + 6 days PMA, pulse oximeter recordings will be

• Infants randomized to receive extended caffeine treatment may benefit directly by [CONTACT_138083] 14 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 • Placebo -treated infants will benefit from the additional support and information provided by 
[CONTACT_3647], and will have the potential for benefit from information obtained from the MRI 
evaluations, which would not have been done absent enrollment in this study. Except for the inflammatory biomarkers and brain MRIs, placebo -treated enrollees are equivalent to “usual 
care” clinical practice in NICUs today.  
 
General Future Pot ential Benefits : 
• This study  will fill several major gaps in our current knowledge: 1) The impact on 
neurodevelopmental outcome of the frequency and severity of IH  in the NICU and at home until 
43 weeks PMA, assessed by [CONTACT_138084], 2) the frequency and severity of IH in preterm infants receiving caffeine vs. placebo while in 
the NICU, 3) the frequency and severity of IH persisting at home after discharge  (for participants 
receiving home oximetry) , and 4) the efficacy of continuing caffeine treatment until 4 2 weeks  + [ADDRESS_157003] to reducing IH  and improving neurodevelopment.   
• Infants randomized to caffeine may benefit from improved neurodevelopmental outcome related 
to attenuated IH  during the period of exposure to study drug.  
2.2.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENT IAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
• The risk: benefit  ratio is favorable  
• Extending caffeine treatment to 42 w eeks + 6 days PMA has the potential of improving brain 
structure and function as determined by [CONTACT_9268] , and improv ing neurodevelopmental outcomes.   
• Infants randomized to placebo will be receiving what is currently the standard of care when their 
last routine caffeine dose is  between 32 weeks + 0 days  PMA and 36 weeks and 5 days PMA .  
• The potential risks are primarily related to b lood sampling and the brain MRIs. As discussed above, 
however, the blood samples will be obtained as a part of clinically indicated blood sampling, and 
the MRIs will be performed without sedation.  
• In summary, the potential benefits exceed the potential risks of participation in this study, and 
there are no increased risks if randomized to receive placebo since placebo infants will otherwise 
be receiving the same clinical care as comparable infants not enrolled in this study .

 OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ENDPOINT S 
Primary    
Primary Objective 1:  Compare the 
extent of IH  exposure, from 
randomization through 42 weeks

gestational week and overall), in 
infants randomized to extended 
caffeine treatment to infants 
assigned to receive placebo.  
Primary Objective 2:  Compare 
changes in a panel of 
inflamma tion-related  cytokines 
and chemokines, from enrollment 
to the target age of 38 weeks + 0 days PMA, in infants randomized 
to extended caffeine treatment to 
infants assigned to receive placebo .  
 
Primary Objective 3 : Compare 
changes in quantitative MRI structural, microstructural and metabolic biomarkers of acute injury, from enrollment to 43 -46 
weeks PMA, in infants 
randomized to extended caffeine 
treatment to infants assigned to 
receive placebo .

imaging (DTI) and proton 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy  (MRS) . # of sec of IH <90% the most 
representative measure to quantitate extent of IH  
    
 
 
Measuring  biomarker 
concentrations at 38 w eeks 
will be a sufficient interval for 
changes since baseline, and 
will be the interval during 
which differences in extent of IH will be maximal.  
    
Quantitative MRI is a sensitive modality for assessing structural, biochemical, and 
functional changes 
consequent to IH and extent 
of improvement with extended caffeine treatment. Assessing at study end will provide maximal time for adverse MRI changes consequent to IH since 
starting study drug .  
Secondary    
Secondary Objective 1: Examine 
the association between salivary 
caffeine concentrations and IH 
outcomes at the one week post 
randomization and 40 weeks + 0 days PMA assessments.  
Secondary Objective 2: 
Determine whether changes , from 
baseline to  follow -up, in Extent of IH  (# of sec <90%)

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
HYPOTHESES : 
Hypothesis 1 : Caffeine will reduce extent of IH  compared to placebo, and this caffeine effect will persist 
to 42 w eeks PMA.    
Hypothesis 2 : Extended caffeine treatment will be associated with less acute inflammation at 37 -38 w eeks 
compared to placebo, and these effects will be mediated by [CONTACT_138085]. 
Hypothesis 3 : Qua ntitative MRI analyses in the active caffeine group,  compare d to the placebo  group,  will 
be associated with  1) greater white matter microstructural organization, 2)  improved neuronal 
metabolism, and 3)  greater regional brain volume, and that these effects will be mediated by [CONTACT_138086]. 
TYPE/DESIGN  OF TRIAL : 
Randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blinded clinical trial   
METHODS TO BE USED TO MINIMIZE BIAS : 
All clinical team personnel and all research staff (except research pharmacist) will remain blinded to study 
group until study completion. Caffeine and equ al volume placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_138087]. The protocol has been designed such that there should be 
no need to break the code for any individual subject.  
NUMBER OF STUDY GROUPS/ARM  & STUDY INTERVENTION DURATION : 
Infants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms, caffeine  base  (Arm 1) and placebo (Arm 
2). Infants from multiple births will be cluster randomized.  The duration of the intervention will be from 
randomization between 32 weeks + 0 days PMA and 36  weeks + 6 days PMA through  42 w eeks  + 6 days  
PMA, the age at which extent of IH no longer differs from healthy infants born at term.  
 
MULTI -SITE STUDY : 
There will be enrollment at multiple  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138019] U.S.  
NAME [CONTACT_138139] :  
Caffeine versus placebo  
 
INTERIM ANALYSIS :  None planned  
STRATIFICATION : 
A site -stratified randomly -permuted blocked randomization design will be used to ensure balance at each 
site. To ensure balance by [CONTACT_138088], randomization will also be stratified into 2 birth 
gestational age categories: 1)  <28 w eeks 2) 28 weeks  + 0 days through  30 w eeks + 6 days . The 
randomization scheme will be developed by [CONTACT_138089], and clinical sites w ill be 
provided appropriate enrollment logs and randomization procedures from the research pharmacy.  
 
SUB-STUDIES :  No ancillary studies planned at this time  
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
  Page 18 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: [ADDRESS_157004] demonstrated that IH associated with immature breathing pattern in infants born 
preterm can be attenuated with caffeine. It is unknown, however, whether persisting IH  after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_138020], which may  only evident with continuing high resolution pulse 
oximetry, results in any long -term injury. The results in the group randomized to extended caffeine 
treatment (Arm 1) will be compared to placebo (Arm 2) to determine if extended caffeine treatment is 
superior to placebo in attenuating or eliminating  the adverse effects of persisting IH on inflammation and 
brain MRI structural, microstructural, and metabolic markers of injury.  
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
Infants will be started on oral caffeine base at 5 mg/kg/day or equivalent volume of placebo. At 36 weeks 
+ 0 days PMA, study d rug dose will be increased to 5 mg/kg BID (total daily dose 1 0 mg/kg) or equivalent 
volume of placebo. The dose will be weight -adjusted weekly until NICU discharge.  The starting dose and 
dose escalation at 36 w eeks + [ADDRESS_157005] eted 
the outpatient brain MRI between  43 weeks + 0 days and 46 weeks + 6 days PMA, as  shown in the 
Schedule of Activities (S OA), Section 1. 3.

5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 
1. Intraventricular hemorrhage Grade III -IV or cystic periventricular leukomalacia  
2. Current or prior treatment for seizures  
3. Current or prior treatment for cardiac arrhythmias  
4. Known renal or hepatic dysfunction that in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_138021] a clinically 
relevant impact on caffeine metabolism  
5. Major malformation, inborn error of metabolism, chromosomal abnormality  
6. Presence of a condition for which survival to discharge unlikely  
7. Social, mental health, logistical or other issues that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would 
impact the ability of the family to complete the study.  
 
 
 
 
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERAT IONS  
• Parents and clinical care providers will be asked to avoid exposure to caffeine for subjects . 
• Open label treatment with a methylxanthine will be documented.   
• There will be no restrictions on maternal diet even if breast feeding.  
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
• Screened and potentially eligible i nfants for enrollment will be screen failures if they reach 36  
weeks + 6 days PMA and are still receiving  routine caffeine or, for whatever reason, cannot be 
enrolled by 36  weeks + 6 days  PMA . 
• Enrolled infants will be screen failures , and will not be randomized, if they do not continue to 
meet  eligibility criteria at the ti me that routine caffeine treatment is being discontinued .  
• Analysis will be by “intention to treat,” and all randomized subjects will remain included in their  
Arm for analysis.    
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRU ITMENT AND RETENTION  
RECRUITMENT : 
• Potential enrollees will all be inpatients in the NICU at one of the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] .  
All inpatients in the NICU born at ≤30 wee ks + 6 days postmenstrual age will be captured in the 
screening log, and beginning at 32  weeks + 0 days PMA, if they are being treated with routine 
caffeine , will be screened for potential eligibility.  Screening w ill be discontinued whenever 
infants meet a specified exclusion criterion for enrollment or if they reach 36 weeks + 6 days 
PMA wi thout meeting all inclusion criteria. It is estimated based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_138022] 30 -50% of 
all screened infants will meet 1 or more exclusion criteria or fail to meet inclusion criteria.   If an 
infant is a transfer from another facility at ≤36+6, they WIL L be added to the screening log.  If 
they are a transfer from another facility at ≥37+0, they WILL NOT be added to the screening log.  
• The families of infants who are meeting enrollment criteria will be approached by [CONTACT_138090].   
 
  Page 20 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 RETENTION : 
• As infants are approaching the time of discharge staff will utilize the pre -discharge  checklist to:  
o Obtain detailed tracking information that provide s information regarding where the 
infant will be cared for post -discharge and multiple methods to contact [CONTACT_138091]  
o Provide and document comprehensive training of families regarding use of the oxygen 
saturation recorder  
o Provide and document traini ng of families regarding giving study drug to their infant and 
using the home drug log  
o Provide and document training of families regarding obtaining and storing the saliva 
sample for caffeine levels  
o Provide and document training of families related to study expectations for future 
communication (i.e. telephone contacts)  and study visits  for the MRI, if necessary, and 
the end of study visit   
• Following discharge  families will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 1 –  [ADDRESS_157009] 
wee kly to support families in performing study procedures including drug administration, use of 
oximeter  (if applicable) , and ascertain any concerns about these procedures or the clinical status 
of the infant, including the occurrence of adverse events.  
• The p arents of each subject will receive gift cards for a total of $100, at completion of their 
participation in the study . The purpose is to defray travel expenses for the return visit, if 
applicable,  and for baby [CONTACT_138092], indicating our appreciation for their support of the collective 
protocol requirements.  
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
• The intervention for this study is the extended treatment of infants with caffeine , for evaluation 
of the efficacy of extended caffeine in ameliorating persisting IH and its adverse consequences 
including inflammation and brain MRI structural and functional injury.  Caffeine is a standard 
treatment  in preterm infants in the NICU, but  currently is commonly discontinued between 32 
and 36 weeks PMA.  T he FDA has granted an IND Exemption for the extended treatment with 
caffeine to 42 weeks + 6 days .  
 
 
6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTR ATION  
• The dose of caffeine  base  will be the same caffeine dose per kg as determined in our recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], both the QD starting dose and the BID dose at 36 w eeks + [ADDRESS_157010] for 
increasing rates of metabolism.  
• The caffeine doses used have been shown in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_138023] s ufficient to achieve and 
maintain effective systemic concentrations for significant attenuation of IH 
• The equal volume placebo will be identical in appearance to the caffeine  
  Page 21 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 • Due to the relatively long half -life of caffeine, timing of doses may have some variance to best 
accommodate routine care and feeding schedules. The time of the 1st dose will be approximately 
[ADDRESS_157011] routine clinical dose, and the subsequen t QD doses will be given at the 
same approximate time each day, as consistent with daily care schedules. Timing of the BID doses 
starting at 36 w eeks + [ADDRESS_157012] consistent with home care schedules, and then repeated at the same approximate time(s)  each day.  
• All study drug will be given prior to a feeding.    
• Study drug will b e continued from the 1st dose, which will be given sometime between 32 weeks 
+ 0 days and 36 weeks + [ADDRESS_157013] scheduled dose at 42  weeks + 6 day s PMA.  
• Study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_138093]. Clinical care and/or research staff will teach parents how to administer so that administration at home will be comparable to that in the NICU.  
• For home use, families will be instructed how to draw up the proper dose from t he study drug 
vials supplied by [CONTACT_3647].  
• Missed QD doses will be given as soon as possible after the missed dose , but that dose will be 
eliminated (and details recorded) if missed for more than  12 hours. For BID doses, missed doses 
will be given as soon as possible after the missed dose, but that dose will be eliminated (and details recorded) if missed for more than 6 hours.  
 
6.2 PREPARATION/H ANDLING/ STORAGE/ ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.2.1  ACQUISITION AND ACCO UNTABILITY  
Each clinical research site is responsible for procuring the required supplies needed to prepare blinded 
doses for both inpatient and outpatient doses.  See Pharmacy Manual for specific compounding 
ingredients and instructions.  
• Instructions will be provided to the parents/caregivers to administer the blinded oral doses just 
prior to the morning feeding and just prior to a late afternoon or early evening feed (breast or 
bottle). A diary will be provided for recording all administered dose s.  
• All used bottles and unused study solution will be returned to t he research pharmacy  (IDS)  at 
study end.  
6.2.2  DOSE PREPARATION , AND LABELING  
Inpatient Doses:   Caffeine base or Placebo  
Caffeine base :  IDS pharmacies will prepare a bulk oral solution containing caffeine base (anhydrous) 10 
mg/mL, according to the instructions in the Pharmacy Manual .  A bulk solution can be prepared 
individually for a patient or can be used for multiple patients (preferred) who are assigned/randomized 
to receive active treatment.  
A 24 hour supply is prepared from the bulk solution and dispensed in a suitable -sized unit -dose, oral 
syringe. All oral syringes prepared and administered in the inpatient setting are to be labeled in a blinded 
fashion, using specific departmental procedures for labeling of blinded syringes and reflecting blinded 
  Page 22 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: [ADDRESS_157014] (e.g. eMAR).  All syringes must be labeled 
as “For Investigational Use Only” (or alternative site specific verbiage to identify a stud y medication).  
Syringes can be prepared as long as 4 days prior to administration (BUD 4 days) and should be stored at 
room temperature . 
Example:  Caffeine base 10 mg/1 mL or Placebo; Caffeine base 10 mg or placebo (1 mL)        
 
Placebo :  Research pharmac ies will prepare a bulk oral solution according to instructions in the pharmacy 
manual .  A bulk solution can be prepared individually for a patient or can be used for multiple patients 
(preferred) who are assigned/randomized to receive placebo treatment.  
A [ADDRESS_157015] (e.g. eMAR). All syringes must be labeled 
as “For Investigational Use Only” (or alternative site specific verbiage to identify a study m edication). 
Syringes can be prepared as long as 4 days prior to administration (BUD 4 days) and should be stored at 
room temperature . 
Example:  Caffeine base 10 mg/1 mL or Placebo; Caffeine base 10 mg or placebo (1 mL)  
 
Outpatient Doses:  
Doses intended for  outpatient administration, starting at time of discharge and continuing until 42 weeks 
+ 6 days PMA, are prepared by [CONTACT_138094] a bulk solution 
containing a sufficient quantity of either the active drug (caffeine base) or placebo to last until 42 weeks 
+ 6 days (BUD 9 0 days) .   
6.2.[ADDRESS_157016] drug preparation 
and dispensing for patients receiving both the active and placebo solutions, prepared for both inpatient 
and outpatient treatment. All supplies used to prepare both the active and placebo oral solutions are to 
be s tored in the IDS/research pharmacy, in accordance with temperature parameters indicated on the 
product label.  
Sites may use/develop their own accountability forms; specific information to be documented on the drug accountability record includes: patient in itials, patient study ID number, individual dose (mg per mL), lot 
number and beyond use date of the prepared solution.  For outpatient dosing, the quantity dispensed 
(mLs), the dose and the dispensing date must also be recorded.  The use of an electronic r ecord (e.g., 
Vestigo) is acceptable as long as the required information is captured, including patient -returned 
medication.  
  Page 23 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 Any remaining doses of study drug not administered at home are to be returned by [CONTACT_138095] -of-study outpatien t visit if applicable, or sent back , and eventually returned to the IDS 
pharmacy for on -site destruction following reconciliation and accountability of the unused doses.  Used 
bottles are to be returned to the IDS pharmacy; if remaining solution is present , it is to be measured and 
recorded as a return.  Empty bottles are to be recorded as zero mL.  Once the information for the returned 
bottle has been recorded, the solution and bottle can be disposed of as non -hazardous pharmaceutical 
waste, according to institutional procedures.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
Randomization:  
• Ideally o ne day  following , but up to the third calendar day  following the last routine caffeine 
treatment dose , enroll ed infants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1  of 2 treatment arms, 
caffeine base or placebo .  
• Infants from multiple births will be cluster randomized.   
• A site -stratified randomly -permuted blocked randomization design will be used to ensure balance 
at each site.  
• To ensure balance by [CONTACT_138088], randomization will also be stratified into 2 birth 
gestational age categories: 1 ) <28 weeks and 2)  28 weeks + 0 days through 30 weeks  + 6 days 
gestation .  
• A randomization scheme will be developed by [CONTACT_138089], and clinical 
sites will be provided appropriate enrollment logs and blinded randomization procedures.  
 
Blinding :  
• Treatment assignments will be blinded until study completion for all study personnel, except for 
the clinical site research pharmacy dispensing study drug.  
• The study pulse oximeter will not have visual displays or alarms for respi[INVESTIGATOR_138024] 43 weeks + 6 days . The IH which is the focus of study 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_138025] b radycardia , and therefore we do not anticipate a need 
for unblinding based on oximeter results  
• Any r equests for unbli nding will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_138096] , and 
can only be authorized by [CONTACT_476].  
• Two s alivary caffeine concentrations are being obtained from  all subjects, but the results of the 
caffeine concentrations will be blinded until all infants have completed the study protocol.  
• Potential caffeine side effects, such as mild tachycardia, irritability or feeding difficulties are frequent  in both caffeine -treated non-treated infants. If such concerns arise, however, at the 
discretion of the clinical care team, study drug may be held for the days necessary , and noted in 
study records , but  would generally not be a reason to request  unblinding.  
• If apnea -related symptoms requiring treatment occur after starting study drug, the clinical care 
team may institute treatment as needed un til cessation of these symptoms, and similarly, this 
also should not require unblinding.   
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
• Approximately the 1st half of study duration will be in the later weeks of the NICU admission. 
Durin g this time, compliance with protocol requirements will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_138097].  
  Page 24 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 • To maximize compliance with study protocol during the several weeks a t home, f amilies will be 
instructed in all aspects of protocol adherence while in the NICU, and reinforced just prior to 
discharge.  
• Once discharged, research staff will contact [CONTACT_138098]  2-[ADDRESS_157017] weekly thereafter to support families and encourage full home 
compliance with protocol requirements.  
• Two salivary caffeine concentrations will be  obtained in all subjects .  Although results  will not be 
available until the end of the study, the results will be useful in analyses to assess adherence to the administration of study drug, and understand the relationship between caffeine 
concentrations  and study safety and efficacy outcomes . 
6.[ADDRESS_157018] been developed for the study and agreed to by [CONTACT_21127].  The Clinical Guidelines for Routine Caffeine Use in NICU (Prior to enrollment in ICAF) 
include: For infants with birth weight < [ADDRESS_157019] 3 days after birth in all infants .  If on CPAP only:  initiate caffeine treatment within the first [ADDRESS_157020] 3 days after birth prior to any caffeine treat ment , initiate caffeine treatment 6 to 8 
hours prior to extubation.  For infants with birth weight ≥1250 grams, if on CPAP or on no respi[INVESTIGATOR_81407], initiate caffeine treatment if the infant experiences >6 apnea epi[INVESTIGATOR_138026] . If 
the infant requires mechanical ventilation, consider starting caffeine treatment prior to extubation.  The 
initial caffeine dose is a 20  mg/kg bolus dose of caffeine citrate (or equivalent caffeine base) followed by 
5-10 mg/kg/day maintenance dose, beginning 24  hours after the loading dose.  Levels are not required to 
monitor for dosage adjustment.  Stop routine caffeine treatment once the infant is free of clinically 
significant epi[INVESTIGATOR_138027] 5 -7 days off of any positive pressure (CPAP or NC > 1L) or at [ADDRESS_157021] .  If the maintenance dose is less than 5 mg/kg, infants may be allowed to 
“outgrow” their dose of caffeine  and the dose should be stopped as noted above ( i.e. no clinically 
significant epi[INVESTIGATOR_74615] 5 -7 days off any positi ve pressure (CPAP or NC > 1L)  or [ADDRESS_157022] .) Following randomization, open label caffeine use is discouraged, however, there are no 
prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_138028] , with 
guidance as needed by [CONTACT_138099].   
 
6.5.[ADDRESS_157023] the following:  1) Hold study drug; 2) begin open -
label maintenance caffeine citrate at 5 -10 mg/kg/day on the same day; 3) as soon as open -label caffeine 
is no longer deemed necessary, stop open -label caffeine and restart study drug at the next regularly 
scheduled time for study drug; 4) there should be n o need to unblind the treatment group, since  
published studies have suggested that it is safe to give the suggested dose of  open -label caffeine  to 
either treatment group .[ADDRESS_157024]

7 STUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
The clinical site principal investigators  may discontinue the participant ’s activity without the participant ’s 
consent if either  of these criteria are met:  
• A participant  consistently  fails to comply with study procedures  
• A participant ’s safety or health may be compromised by [CONTACT_138101]  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE S TUDY  
Each study participant  may withdraw consent at any time during the study without penalty. In the event 
a participant  is discontinued and thus no longer  receiving the study drug, the participant  will be asked to 
continue with follow -up assessment as described below, and not considered withdrawn from the study. 
If the participant  refuses further follow -up, then  the participant  will be considered to be withdrawn. 
Counseling about the participant 's health will be provided if the participant  decides to discontinue 
participation in the study. Medical advice regarding what is in the best interest of the participant  will be 
provided.  
All data c ollected up to the time of withdrawal will be reported. The End of Study eCRF will be completed, 
with the reason for withdrawal specified.  
7.[ADDRESS_157026] TO F OLLOW- UP 
• A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails t o return for the end-of-study 
visit between  43 weeks + 0 days and 46 weeks and 6 days PMA and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_138102] (1) reschedule the final visit for the brain MRI  (if applicable) to be completed 
by 46 weeks + 6 days , and (2) return all study equipment and supplies  within the next 4 w eeks . 
• If the subject does not return for the final evaluation, t he site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_138103] 1 -4 weeks, counsel the participant on the 
importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule , and ascertain if the family  wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the clinical site investigator  or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_138104] 26 of 66

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1.1  OXYGEN SATURATION  
Continuous recording of O 2 saturation using the study pulse oximeter is planned  for all infants through 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and for the sub- group of i nfants recruited at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138029] ,will continue  through 43 weeks + 6 days PMA (i.e. one week following the last dose of study 
drug ).  The study oximeter will be the Masimo RAD -97, set at the minimum possible averaging time  of 2-
4 sec and a sampling rate of 1 sec (high resolution) .  The oximeter will be preset in the sleep lab mode,  
hence with no “probe off ,” “low battery,” or physiologic visual displays or alarms.   The internal data 
storage capacity of the RAD -97 oxime ter is sufficient for 28 days of continuous data collection.  
Inpatient  Phase : During the inpatient phase, the RAD -[ADDRESS_157028] every 4 weeks while 
in the NICU  and at discharge.  
Please note:  Some sites may discontinue oximeter recordings at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Outpatient  Phase :  At sites  participating in the home oximetry portion of the study, p rior to discharge, 
the family will be trained in the use of the RAD -97, and will be  asked to use the oximeter  during all sleep 
times and quiet  awake periods until 43 weeks + [ADDRESS_157029]  8 – 
[ADDRESS_157030] 2 –  [ADDRESS_157031] weekly to 
provide support in the use of the study monitor a nd to support other aspects of the study protocol .  As 
part of their support of the use the monitor at home, study site staff will assess if the use pattern is such 
that the oximeter memory might be close to capacity, and deter mine if it is necessary to schedule  an 
additional data download.  
8.1.2  INFLAMMARORY BIOMARKERS  
An EDTA  blood sample (0.6 – 0.8 ml) to measure a panel of inflammatory biomarkers will be obtained at 
enrollment prior to randomization, and again at 38 weeks + [ADDRESS_157032] . The b lood will be  centrifuged and the resultant plasma aliquot ed into tubes and immediately 
frozen ( -80 °C). The intent is to freeze a plasma volume of at least 0.3 ml. As specified by [CONTACT_138105][INVESTIGATOR_3930], the frozen samples will be batched and shipped on dry ice o vernight using shippi[INVESTIGATOR_138030].  
 
  Page 28 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 Bulk analys es of inflammatory biomarker plasma concentrations  will be performed at Children’s National 
Medical Center  using a  commercially available ELISA multi- spot assay to measure inflammation -related 
proteins from different functional categories  of cytokines  and chemokines, including growth factors, and 
adhesion molecules, IFN-alpha, IL -6, Gro/CXCL1, IL -1β, IL -4-6, IL -6 rece ptor, IL -8, IL -10, IL -13, ICAM -1, 
myeloperoxidase, CRP, MCP, IGFBP -1, MIP -1a, RANTES, and TNFa.  Analytes that show strong trends or 
significance with this assay may be further analyzed with individual ELISA assays, to confirm the original 
result.  
 
8.1.3  QUANTITA TIVE MRI S TRUCTURAL, MICROSTRUCTURAL AND M ETABOLIC 
BIOMARKERS OF A CUTE BRAIN INJURY  
Our goal is to obtain baseline and follow -up b rain MRI in approximately half of the study participants ( 55 
subjects in  each study arm ).   For additional information, refer to MRI Manual.  
 At sites recruiting infants into the MRI portion of the study, i nfants will be quieted by [CONTACT_138106]. O
2 saturation, heart rate and temperature will be monitored and recorded 
throughout the scan. All infants will be protected from MRI scanner noise by [CONTACT_138107], and mini 
muffs (Natus MiniMuffs Noise Attenuators). MRI acquisition protocols will be standardized and field -
tested across all sites in Y1 Q1 -3, and MRI calibration studies will be performed t o ensure that the MRI 
scanner properties and parameter settings during the acquisition phase are correct. Conventional MRI studies will be reviewed in a standardized fashion by a pediatric neuroradiologist at each site blinded to study randomization.  
 All MRI data sets will be processed at the Advanced Pediatric Brain Imaging Research Laboratory (DBRL) 
at Children’s National Medical Center.  All quantitative MRI outcome measures are continuous and will be 
performed by a single investigator masked to randomization . Abnormalities of brain development, 
maturation, the presence of focal destructive ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions, will be documented.

week after starting study drug, and the 2nd, which may be either in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138031] , at 
about 40 weeks + 0 days PMA.  All samples will be pre-prandial. Salivary volumes of 200 -300 uL will be 
collected using commerci ally available kits (Salimetrics, State College, PA) and frozen at -20o C at home 
and then at - 20° C or colder after return to the clinical site research team for bulk analysis at the end of 
the study. Parents will return the home salivary sample at the same time as their scheduled return to the 
clinical site at study end. As specified by [CONTACT_138105][INVESTIGATOR_3931], the frozen salivary samples will be 
batched and shipped on dry ice overnight with the pl asma samples using shippi[INVESTIGATOR_138032].  
Salivary analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_138108]. Sample preparation and chromatography will utilize a method validated in our 
preliminary study.89,90  Chromatography will be performed using a Waters Alliance 2695 Separations 
Module equipped with a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array detector and Waters Symmetry column.

 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 8.1.5  BRIEF INFANT SLEEP QUESTIONNAIRE (BISQ)  
The Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) is a p arent -reported questionnaire on infant/toddler sleep 
over the prior one week .  It includes 13 items in three categories (sleep duration, night wakings, and 
method  of falling asleep).  The BISQ will be completed  by [CONTACT_138109] e weekly phone call that  is 
scheduled between 42 weeks 0 days and 42 weeks 6 days, or in person, at study termination if this occurs 
prior to 42 weeks + 0 days.  
 
 
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
8.2.1  TELEPHONE ASSESSMENT  OF STATUS AT HOME  
Within 1 – [ADDRESS_157034] log will document:  
• Family questions or concerns  
• Assessment of compl etion of the drug log and issues related to administration or supply of study 
drug 
• Assessment of extent of use of study oximeter  (if applicable)  and any questions, problems or 
other concerns related to study drug 
• Discussion  of upcoming study procedures  
• Assessment for occurrence of adverse events  
• Determination of use of concomitant  medications  
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS (AE)  
• Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
• Since there will be multiple participating clinical sites, centralized safety oversight will be 
coordinated by [CONTACT_138110] . 
• The study does not involve an investigational new drug, but is extending the duration of caffeine treatment beyond the customary age of discontinuing caffeine treatment in the NICU. The FDA has deemed the use of caffeine in this study as consisten t with prior FDA approv al, and has 
therefor e granted an IND Exemption.   
• There is no risk in randomizing to placebo; absent enrollment in this study, infants would not be 
treated with caffeine.  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS (SA E)  
An adverse event ( AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor,  it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10240], or a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138033] 30 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.    
Note that for the purpose of this study, delaying discharge of an infant related to achieving a specified ‘spell -free’ 
number of days  shall NOT  be considered a ‘prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]’ for the purpose of categoriz ing 
an event as a serious adverse event.  
 
 
 
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN  ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
The following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern  with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_138111]. The degree of certainty 
about causality will be graded using the categories below :  
• Definitely Related –  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event occurs in a plausible time relationship to 
study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19010].  
• Probably Related –  There is evidence to suggest a causal relatio nship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
• Potentially Related –  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). An AE ma y rate as “possibly related” soon after discovery, but it can be 
flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related –  A clinic al event whose temporal relationship to study intervention 
administration makes a causal relationship improbable  and other drugs or underlying disease 
provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments ). 
• Not Related –  The AE is completely independent of study  intervention administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. The  alternative, definitive 
etiology must be documented by [CONTACT_138112] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPE CTEDNESS  
  Page 31 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 • The clinical site principal investigators  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse 
event ( AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, 
or frequency of the event is not consistent with the well -established risk information previously 
described for caffeine.  
 
 
• Expected AE for caffeine treatment can include tachycardia, feeding intolerance, jitteriness. 
However, no significant AE are expected since all enrollees will have previously tolerated routine 
caffeine treatment at systemic concentrations similar to those achieved in this study.    
  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AN D FREQUENCY FOR EVEN T ASSESSMENT AND FOL LOW- UP 
• The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention 
of clinical care personnel as part of routine NICU care, or by [CONTACT_138113] . 
• All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on 
the appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, 
time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study prod uct (assessed only by 
[CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of 
the event.  
• All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
• Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is enroll ed will be considered 
as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it wi ll be recorded as an AE.  
• Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of ea ch epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].   
• Designated study site research staff will record all reportable events occurring in the NICU  
starting  from when informed consent is obtained until the last day of study participation  (for non -        
serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.   NOTE: Last day of study 
participation may be any of the following:  
o end-of-study visit  
o follow -up MRI visit  
o Lost-to-follow -up determination date  
• After discharge home, research staff will query parents at least weekly abo ut the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last contact .  Events will be followed for outcome information unt il resolution 
or stabilization.  
 
  
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
AEs and SAEs  will be documented in the source records and recorded on the eCRFs using accepted medical terms 
and/or the diagnoses that accurately characterize the event. When a diagnosis is known, the AE term recorded on 
the eCRF will be the diagnosis rather than a constellation of symptoms. The clinical site principal investigator s or

 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: [ADDRESS_157035], severity, expectedness, and 
other possible etiologies. When an event has not resolved by [CONTACT_138114], it will be documented on the AE eCRF 
as “ongoing”.  
The timeframe for the collection of AEs and SAEs is noted above in section 8.3.4.  
 
 
 
 
  
8.3.[ADDRESS_157036] be reported promptly (within 24  hours) to the study DCC , whether or not the event is 
considered related to study product. Further, the clinical site principal investigators should comply with 
relevant clinical study site  IRB requirements  on reporting SAEs.  
Clinical site principal investigators must submit additional information as soon as it is available on the SAE 
report form. The study DCC  will report unexpected SAEs associated with the use of the drug as required .  
Clinical site principal investigators must follow all relevant regulatory requ irements as well as specific 
policy regarding the timely reporting of SAEs to the study DCC and the clinical study site  IRB.  
Reporting to the study DCC  does not fulfill the clinical site principal investigator’s duty to report all 
unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others to the IRB. The clinical site principal 
investigators  will notify the clinical study site  IRB and ICAF principal investigators .  
• Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_138115] [INVESTIGATOR_138034],  or which meets the definition of an SAE included in Sect ion 8. 3.2, Definition of 
Serious Adverse Event s must be submitted on an SAE form to the Data Coordinating Center ( DCC).   
• The DSMB  will receive  expedited  notification of all SA Es, even if not thought to be related to study 
intervention .   
• All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the clinical 
site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_138035]. Other 
supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_36909] ( DCC) 
and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_157037]  
• Although rare, infants bo rn at ≤30  weeks gestation and discharged home are at risk for an 
apparent life -threatening event (ALTE, or brief resolved unexpected event,  BRUE) or for sudden 
unexpected infant death (S UID) 
  Page 33 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 • Infants enrolled in this study are at no greater risk, and perhaps at even less risk, for such events 
than infants not enrolled   
 
8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNAN CY  
Not applicable  
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLE MS 
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
Federal regulations  (45 CFR Part 46/32 CFR 219)  require that unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or 
others be promptly reported to the IRB. These events encompass a broader category of events than SAEs and may 
include issues such as problems with lo ss of control of subject data or the investigational product; adverse 
psychological reactions; or breach of confidentiality. Risks to others ( e.g., program personnel) must also be reported.    
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unan ticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures tha t are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related t o participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLE M REPORTING  
The clinical site principal investigator s will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) occurring from the time 
the informed consent form is obtained  through [ADDRESS_157038] ( IRB) and t o the Data Coordinating C enter ( DCC)/ICAF  
principal investigators  The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, Clinical site principal investigator’s  
name, and the IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs will be reported to the clinical study site IRB and to the DCC  and PI/Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_874]  1 business 
day  of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
  Page 34 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
  
All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written 
reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ) promptly after the clinical s tudy site IRB’s receipt of the report of th e problem from 
the clinical site principal investigator s. 
 
 
 
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
Primary Objective  1: Compare the extent of IH exposure , from randomization through  42 weeks + 6 
days PMA (within each gestational week and overall), in infants randomized to extended caffeine 
treatment to infants assigned to receive placebo. We hypothesize that caffeine will reduce the  extent of 
IH compared to placebo, and that this caffeine effect will  persist through 42 w eeks PMA.    
 
Primary Objective  2: Compare changes in a panel of inflammation -related  cytokines and chemokines, 
from enrollment to the target age of 38 w eeks + 0 days PMA, in infants randomized to extended  caffeine  
treatment to infants assigned to receive placebo . We hypothesize that continuing caffeine treatment will 
be associated with less inflammation compared to placebo.  
 
Primary Objective  3: Compare changes in quantitative MRI structural, microstructural and me tabolic 
biomarkers of acute injury, from enrollment to 43 -46 weeks PMA,  in infants randomized to extended  
caffeine  treatment to infants assigned to receive placebo . We hypothesize that continued caffeine 
treatment compared to placebo will be associated wit h 1) greater white matter microstructural 
organization, 2) improved neuronal metabolism, and 3) greater regional brain volume.  
Secondary Objective 1: Examine the association between salivary caffeine concentrations and IH  
outcomes at the one week post rand omization and  40 weeks + [ADDRESS_157039] less severe IH outcomes . 
Secondary Objective 2: Determine whether caffeine effects on changes in inflammatory or MRI 
biomarkers from baseline to follow -up are mediated by [CONTACT_138069] -related reduced IH .  We hypothesize that 
caffeine effects on changes in inflammatory or MRI biomarkers will be at least partially mediated by 
[CONTACT_138116].  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
  Page 35 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 Sample Size:  We will randomize 220 infants, 110 in each treatment group, with  ≥100 infants/group 
available for final analyses. Sample size considerations focus on PMA week -specific differences between 
the extended caffeine vs. placebo infants for our primary outcome o f #sec/day < 90% saturation from [ADDRESS_157040] that 1) the caffeine effect may decline and 2) moderate 
effects will be needed to achieve a meaningful reduction in  IH to [ADDRESS_157041] size of 0.50 to represent a meaningful detectable difference between groups.   Final samples of 
n=100 per group gives 82% power to detect this effect, testing at the overall 2 -tailed .05 level with a 
familywise Type I error correction adjusting for multiple testing across weeks. Secondary outcomes of # IH 
event s and #sec < 80% saturation/day showed effect sizes at 38 weeks PMA of 0.73 and 0.46 in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_116378].  
 
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
The intention -to-treat  (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects.   
 The mod ified intention -to-treat (mITT) p opulation will include all subjects who took at least one dose of 
study drug and who have data available for efficacy outcomes.   
 The safety population will consist of all randomized subjects who receive a dose of study drug.  
 
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Statistical significance will be declared at the two-sided p <0.05  level ; when appropriate , correction for 
multiple comparisons will be employed.  For analyses  of primary and secondary objectives,  we will adjust 
for demographic and clinical differences.   When employed, tests for interaction will at the 0.[ADDRESS_157042] and 95%  confidence intervals . If lost to follow -up 
exceeds the 10% anticipate d under sample size considerations, multiple imputation on the intent -to-treat 
population will be used for sensitivity analyses that account for missing data.  All computations will be 
performed using the latest available version of SAS® . 
 
Demographic variables and subject characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_138117]. Continuous parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean,  
median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value). Categorical demog raphic  parameters, such 
as gender, will be summarized as a percentage  of the  population.
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY EFFICACY ENDPOIN TS  
Primary Objective 1:  Compare the extent of IH exposure , from randomization through  42 w eeks + 6 
days  PMA (within each gestational week and overall), in infants randomized to extended caffeine 
treatment to infants assigned to receive placebo.  
Analyses  for this objective  will be performed on the mITT  population  and compare those randomized to 
extended caffeine vs. placebo.  To be included in  IH analyses , a subject must have had at least [ADDRESS_157043] one PMA week. A single overall baseline SaO 2 
  Page 36 of 66 
 
 ICAF Protocol Version 4.2: 27  September 9, 2021  
  
 
 will be determined for each infant, confirmed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_1427] y to be ≥95% for the PMA  weeks bein g  
studied. An  IH event is defined as SaO 2 decrease ≥10% (event threshold) and lasting ≥5 sec; the event ends 
when SaO 2 increases above the event threshold. For sec of SaO 2 below threshold, all sec below the 
threshold are included. We will compare extended caffeine vs. placebo infants on measures of IH, with # 
of sec <90% saturation/day our primary outcome. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_138036] # of sec <90% optimally 
discriminates between infants on vs. not on extended caffeine, with  high correlation between #sec < 90% 
saturation/day and multiple other measures to quantify IH  which will be secondary outcomes, including 
#IH events/day, # sec < 80% saturation/day, nadir saturation during events, duration of events 
(Spearman’s correlatio ns r >0.90, and AOC during events below 90% and 80% threshold saturation 
(r=0.83).90 Preliminary data showed that these outcomes follow a log -normal distribution, and data will 
be log- transformed for analysis; non -parametric procedures will be considered as an alternative analytic 
approach if warranted by [CONTACT_138118] s. Exploratory analyses will also compare 
caffeine vs. placebo on heart rate data.  As a check on randomization, preliminary analyses will compare 
the two study groups on key characteristics including gestational age, birth weight,  infant sex, morbidity 
(e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis, mild BPD), and severity of illness measures; variables found to differ 
meaningfully between groups will be controlled for in primary analyses through multiple linear regression models. Primary analyses will determine how lon g extended caffeine provides an advantage over placebo 
by [CONTACT_138119] -specific differences between study groups through multiple regression models 
controlling for key covariates using Holm’s family -wise error adjustment to account for multiple testing  
across PMA weeks.   
Primary Objective 2:  Compare changes in a panel of inflammation -related  cytokines and chemokines , 
from enrollment to the target age of 38 w eeks + [ADDRESS_157044] had a baseline/follow -
up pair of blood samples for whic h at least one biomarker was measured on both samples.  Analysis will 
focus on change in inflammatory biomarker levels over the study period.  Preliminary analyses will 
examine the distribution of biomarkers, and data will be transformed (e.g., logged) as appropriate for 
analysis. Two approaches will be taken for the primary analyses, comparing changes in biomarkers over 
the study period in extended caffeine vs. placebo infants.  First, we will conduct separate analyses of each 
inflammatory biomarker using linear regression models to compare study groups at study completion, 
controlling for baseline levels as well as key covariates including morbidities that might be associated with 
inflammation, using the Benjamini and Hochberg method to account for multipl e testing by [CONTACT_3029].  Second, we will examine the structure of the biomarker data using data reduction 
procedures of factor analyses (identifying latent variables reflected by [CONTACT_138120]) and latent 
profile analysis  (identifying subgroups of infants with similar patterns of biomarker profiles). Extended 
caffeine vs. placebo infants would then be compared on the summary measures of inflammation 
biomarkers resulting from these analyses.

 Primary Objective 3 : Compare changes in quantitative MRI structural, microstructural and metabolic 
biomarkers of acute injury , from enrollment to [ADDRESS_157045] had a baseline/follow -
up pair of MRI studies completed from which  at lea st one MRI endpoint could be measured on bot h 
assessments.  
Primary neuroimaging outcome measures will include microstructural measures derived from our DTI 
analyses (FA/MD) and proton MRS.  Secondary outcomes will include regional tissue volumes. Individual 
end-of-study MRI parameters will be compared through analysis of covariance multiple linear regression 
models controlling for the MRI parameter at baseline along with key covariates including indicators of 
comorbidities potentially associated with brain development , using the Benjamini and Hochberg method 
to account for multiple testing by [CONTACT_138121].  .  
Secondary Objective 1: Examine the association between salivary caffeine concentrations and IH 
outcomes at the one week post randomization and  40 weeks + 0 days PMA assessments.  
Analyses will examine the association between salivary caffeine levels and IH outcomes, both at the end 
of the inpatient stay and at study completion. Caffeine levels at home will also be used to verify protocol 
adherence. Secondary analyses will also include relationship between individual neonatal morbidities and 
extent of IH in caffeine and placebo groups. Exploratory analyses will model the trends in IH  parameters 
over time in the extended caffeine an d placebo groups using mixed -effects linear regression models for 
longitudinal data.  Should missing data become a problem, multiple imputation methods will be used to 
account for potential bias in the complete case analysis.  
Secondary Objective 2:  Determine whether changes, from baseline to  follow -up, in inflammatory or 
MRI biomarkers are mediated by [CONTACT_138069] -related reduced  IH. 
 
We will also examine  IH levels during the study period as a mediator of the extended caffeine effect.  Initial 
analyses will examine associations between IH parameters and inflammatory biomarkers, to determine 
which IH measures are most strongly correlated with inflammation at s tudy completion. Linear structural 
equation mediational models will be used to determine whether any associations between extended caffeine treatment and changes in inflammatory biomarkers can be explained by [CONTACT_138122]. The rela tionship between neonatal morbidities, Inflammation, and response to caffeine 
will also be assessed.  
Similarly we will also examine associations between changes in MRI parameters and levels of  IH during 
the study period through correlation and linear regre ssion models with the goal of determining IH  
parameters most strongly associated with brain injury. Structural equation mediational models will 
determine whether any associations between extended caffeine and MRI changes can be explained by

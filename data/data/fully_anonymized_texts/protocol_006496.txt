SYNOPSIS, Study Entry Criteria  8.5.2 Exclusion Criteria Added text in bold: 3. Subjects who: • Are current smokers, users of inhaled cannabis and/or e-cigarettes/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_431125], Wording updated to clarify that inhaled cannabis and e-cigarettes/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_431126]. Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments Added: • Footnote 17: Site regular assessment of diary completion for compliance  • Footnote 18: SABA use is defined as the number of individual puffs or inhalations taken by [CONTACT_423]. • Requirement for AVTX-002 Plasma (PK blood draw) at the Early Termination Visit.  This has been added to the table as well as Footnote 16.  Additional footnotes made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter as well as to ensure regular review of diary data by [CONTACT_21127].  PK blood draw added as part of Early Termination visit in order to ensure information is available on AVTX-[ADDRESS_545385] dose in subjects who discontinue from study early.  Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments Updated (change noted in bold): Footnote [ADDRESS_545386] to continue.   Widened window for confirmation of eligibility to allow time to receive and review all screening visit data. 
Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments  8.2 Discussion of Study Design    Clarified that: Visit 1a may be completed either by [CONTACT_431148]-clinic visit, depending upon the needs of the site or subject.  Additions made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter. 8.5 Study Entry Criteria   Added: Subjects are to be enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria below.  The diagnosis of NEA is determined at Screening Visit 1 based upon Inclusion Criteria 2 through 5. At Baseline Visit 2, a review of all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria should be done to ensure continued eligibility prior to randomization and dosing the subject. As long as the subject qualifies as having NEA per protocol at the Screening Visit, there is no expectation that their diagnosis be re-confirmed at Baseline Visit 2, and therefore changes in eosinophil count and/or ACQ score within the period of time between Screening Visit 1 and Baseline Visit 2 Additions made based upon a prior protocol clarification letter.

Per the schedule of assessments, a urine pregnancy test must be completed and show negative results at Baseline Visit [ADDRESS_545388] Withdrawal  [IP_ADDRESS] Disposition and Withdrawals  Added: Any subject who receives three doses of AVTX-[ADDRESS_545389] meeting these criteria should continue receiving study drug should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the medical monitor.   Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from study drug should be followed up as instructed in the schedule of assessments.   Given each dose of study drug equates to 4 weeks of therapy, clarified that subjects who receive all 3 doses are considered as completing study therapy.   Also provided requirements for study drug discontinuation based upon meeting criteria for an asthma related event. 
9.11.4 Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431127]: Subjects who require systemic corticosteroids or another non-study asthma medication to treat an asthma exacerbation should be withdrawn from the study.  If a subject receives a systemic corticosteroid for another reason (e.g., bee sting), the Medical Monitor should be consulted regarding the subject’s continuation in the study. Additions made for clarification of withdrawal criteria previously omitted. 10 STUDY PROCEDURES Added: In the event a subject cannot be in-clinic for a study visit after randomization due to pandemic, natural disaster, or other kinds of unforeseeable situations, sites should attempt to complete as many visit procedures as possible that can be done remotely, by [CONTACT_431149]/video, on time and per protocol windows.

COORDINATING PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR / PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR  
   [INVESTIGATOR_431130]: • The efficacy of AVTX-002 will be determined by [CONTACT_431154] (primary endpoint), time to asthma related events, and change from baseline in the following parameters: FEV1; FeNO; ACQ; AQLQ(S)+12; Asthma Symptom Diary Score; European Quality of Life – 5 Dimension 5 level Questionnaire; Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGI-C/S); Clinician Global Impression of Improvement/Severity (CGI-I/S); and incidence of short-acting beta agonist (SABA) use. Safety: The safety of AVTX-002 will be determined by [CONTACT_324332], clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, and physical examinations. Pharmacodynamics: The PD of AVTX-002 will be determined by [CONTACT_431155]. Immunogenicity: The immunogenicity of AVTX-002 will be determined by [CONTACT_431156]. Exploratory: • Evaluation of the primary endpoint in subjects with <150 eosinophils/µL • Sputum soluble LIGHT and gene expression (select subset of sites/subjects only) • Inflammatory proteins including but not limited to: IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF-α • AVTX-[ADDRESS_545405] timepoints 
17OCT2022 Page 12 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.[ADDRESS_545406] (continuity corrected).  Summary statistics will be provided via a 2x2 table showing the number and percentage with and without asthma-related events in each treatment group. The test statistic, its associated p-value and a 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference will also be provided. All other efficacy variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics for continuous data will include number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Summaries of change from baseline variables will include only subjects who have both a baseline value and corresponding value at the timepoint of interest. Descriptive statistics for categorical data will include frequencies and percentages.  AE data will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The overall incidence of subjects having at least one AE will be summarized. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], system organ class (SOC), and preferred term (PT). Each subject will be counted only once per SOC and PT. For all continuous safety variables (e.g., laboratory and vital sign measures), descriptive statistics for all reported values and change from baseline values will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION The sample size in this study will be approximately 80 with 40 subjects per treatment arm, randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_545407], rates of 6% in the active group and 44% in the placebo group were observed (Wenzel, 2013). If these estimates were used as is, then a study with [ADDRESS_545408] over 95% power.  Considering likely variations from the cited study, estimates of sample were assessed assuming a Type I error of 5% and the proportion of subjects with an asthma related event ranging from 30% to 50% in the placebo group and 5% to 8% in the active group. In the 20 such scenarios examined, only in the cases in which the difference between treatments gets below 23% does the power fall slightly below 80%. In the vast majority of cases examined the power is greater than 90%. STUDY AND TREATMENT DURATION After the Screening visit, subjects will complete a 30-day, stable therapy, run-in until randomization at the Baseline Visit (Day 0). AVTX-002 or placebo will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56). The final visit will be on Day 98. The overall study duration will be up to approximately 135 days.

Asthma affects approximately 25 million patients in the US and over 300 million globally (Centers for Disease Control, 2021, IHME, 2019). There are classifications of asthma based on the inciting factors (allergic versus non- allergic) and the nature of the immune-inflammatory response (Th2 or low/no Th2) (Ray and Kolls 2017, Wenzel et al., 1999, Woodruff et al., 2009). An allergic or Th2 biased response is associated with eosinophilic classifications and related to type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Lambrecht, Hammad, and Fahy 2019). Non-allergic or low/absent Th2 response is associated with neutrophilic and pauci-granulocytic classifications, which as a group are called non- eosinophilic asthma and account for 40% - 50% of all asthma patients (Douwes et al. 2002, Stokes et al., 2016).  The long-term control of asthma is typi[INVESTIGATOR_431136]-acting bronchodilators in combination with inhaled corticosteroids as needed. For patients specifically with severe allergic asthma, biologic agents have been approved for treatment which target IgE (omalizumab) or the Th2-related cytokine pathways of IL-4 and IL-5 (mepolizumab, resilizumab, benralizumab, and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]). The cytokine pathways identified as contributing to NEA include IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFNγ, TNFα, and G-CSF (Lambrecht, Hammad, and Fahy 2019). For NEA patients with severe disease, there are no approved agents related to these pathways and, as such, there remains a significant unmet medical need for these patients. Previously it was demonstrated that human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_431137] (LTbR) and upon LIGHT stimulation of BEC there is a resulting broad gene expression of proinflammatory mediators, with these proinflammatory changes in gene expression being resistant to corticosteroid treatment; consistent with the clinical presentation of NEA (da Silva Antunes et al. 2015).  Human BEC cells express receptors for LIGHT (LTβR) and upon LIGHT stimulation of BECs in vitro there is a resulting broad gene expression of proinflammatory mediators (da Silva Antunes et al. 2015), which are resistant to corticosteroid treatment, consistent with the clinical presentation of NEA. Soluble proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, OSM, and MCP- [ADDRESS_545429] resulted in lowered sputum neutrophil counts and fewer mild exacerbations (Nair et al. 2012). Separately, sputum levels of soluble LIGHT positively correlated with increased sputum Th1 cytokine levels and neutrophil counts and negatively correlated with lung function (Romeo 2013). Along with soluble LIGHT detected in sputum, others have observed elevated serum levels of DcR3 in asthma patients, which are even greater during asthma exacerbations suggesting a response to elevated LIGHT levels in relation to asthma and disease activity (Kowal et al., 2019).  6.2 Nonclinical Experience

 8 STUDY DESIGN 8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVTX-002 for the treatment of poorly controlled NEA. Upon confirmation of eligibility, subjects will complete a 30-day, salmeterol and fluticasone stable dose, run-in prior to randomization. At Baseline subjects will be randomized to receive either three doses of AVTX- 002 at 600 mg (Days 0, 28 and 56) or they will receive 3 doses of placebo at the same time points.    Subjects will then begin a withdrawal of salmeterol and fluticasone therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Subjects will discontinue salmeterol at Day 14 and then taper fluticasone use to 50% dose at Day 28. Fluticasone use will be completely discontinued at Day 42.  Subjects will be followed until Day 98. An adequate number of subjects will be enrolled to ensure approximately 80 subjects complete the study. All subjects will undergo efficacy, safety, PK/PD, and immunogenicity assessments. The efficacy  of AVTX-002 will be determined by [CONTACT_431158] (primary endpoint), time to asthma related event, and change from baseline in the following parameters: FEV1; FeNO; ACQ; AQLQ(S)+12); Asthma Symptom Diary Score; European Quality of Life – 5 Dimension 5 level Questionnaire; Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity (PGI-C/S); Clinician Global Impression of Improvement/Severity (CGI-I/S); and Incidence of short-acting beta agonist (SABA) use. All subjects will be monitored for AEs and will undergo physical exams, vital signs, and routine safety laboratory tests. The PK/PD of AVTX-002 will be determined by [CONTACT_431159]-002 and LIGHT in addition to other biomarkers of NEA. Finally, the immunogenicity of AVTX-002 will be determined by [CONTACT_431156]. The study schema is displayed in Figure 1.  Figure 1:      Study Schema 
    8.2 Discussion of Study Design This study will assess safety and efficacy of AVTX-002 in subjects with poorly controlled non- eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will be evaluated for enrollment at the Screening visit. If considered eligible for enrollment, subjects will undergo a 30-day, stable dose, run-in period with a LABA (salmeterol) and an ICS 

17OCT2022 Page 28 of 58 Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0  
 (fluticasone). Documentation of eligibility on all Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria is required before a subject can enter the study 30-day run-in period prior to Visit 2 (Randomization) when the subject is switched to stand alone Salmeterol and Fluticasone. Confirmation of eligibility should take place within a reasonable amount of time after the Screening Visit. If confirmation of eligibility is not available within [ADDRESS_545432] to continue. During the 30-day run-in, a visit (Visit 1a) should occur 7 days prior to Baseline, at Day  -7 (-2 day window).  Visit 1a may be completed either by [CONTACT_431148]-clinic visit, depending upon the needs of the site or subject.  During this visit, the subject should be reminded to begin daily peak flow measurements as well as completion of the daily diary to capture ASD, SABA use and daily peak flow values.   After the run-in period, subjects will be randomized at the Baseline Visit (Day 0) to either AVTX-002 administered at 600 mg or placebo. Subjects will receive AVTX-002 or placebo at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28) and Visit 7 (Day 56). Over the        course of the first 42 days after randomization subjects will taper or discontinue use of products administered during their run-in period. Salmeterol will be discontinued at Visit 4 (Day 14), fluticasone use will be tapered to 50% dose at Visit 5 (Day 28) and fluticasone will be discontinued completely at Visit 6 (Day 42). All subjects will proceed on AVTX-002 or placebo monotherapy until Visit 9 (Day 98), which is also the end of study visit. Efficacy will be assessed from Baseline Visit (Day 0) through Visit 9 (Day 98) per the schedule outlined in schedule of assessments (Table 1). The run-in period after Screening and before Baseline must be completed with a stand-alone LABA (salmeterol) and an ICS (fluticasone). Principal investigators will ensure subjects are transitioned to these stand-alone products at Run-In if the subject is not already on these products. If a subject must discontinue the study prior to Visit 9 (Day 98) for any reason, the subject will be required to complete an Early Termination Visit (Day 98 procedures). 8.[ADDRESS_545433] at approximately 25 study sites in the US.  8.4 Selection of Study Population Subjects diagnosed with NEA (<300 eosinophils/µL) will be randomized into the study. An adequate number of subjects will be enrolled to ensure approximately 80 subjects complete the study. A screening log of study candidates will be maintained at each study site.  8.5 Study Entry Criteria Subjects are to be enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria below.  The diagnosis of NEA is determined at Screening Visit 1 based upon Inclusion Criteria 2 through 5. At Baseline Visit 2, a review of all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria should be done to ensure continued eligibility prior to randomization and dosing the subject. As long as the subject qualifies as having NEA per protocol at the Screening Visit, there is no expectation that their diagnosis be re-confirmed at Baseline Visit 2, and therefore changes in eosinophil count and/or ACQ score within the period of time between Screening Visit [ADDRESS_545434] be drawn as part of Baseline Visit 2 procedures,

If the subject refuses this visit/procedures associated with this visit, data on concomitant medications and AEs will be collected if the subject agrees.                                  Data on concomitant medications and AEs can be collected via a telephone call if the subject refuses an in-person visit. Withdrawal of consent for a study means the subject does not wish to receive further protocol- required treatment or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation. Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publicly available data can be included after withdrawal of consent.   Any subject who receives three doses of AVTX-[ADDRESS_545447] should be followed-up as instructed in the schedule of assessments (Table 1). The reason for withdrawal must be determined by [CONTACT_57127]’s medical record and on the electronic case report form (eCRF) as well as the date of discontinuation. If a subject is withdrawn for more than [ADDRESS_545448] clinically relevant reason should be entered on the eCRF. Reasons for discontinuation include but are not limited to: • Lack of efficacy • Adverse event • Death • Protocol deviation • Physician decision • Sponsor request • Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] • Lost to follow-up • Other (specify). For example, pregnancy.  Subjects who require systemic corticosteroids or other non-study drug for treatment of their asthma should be considered to have lack of efficacy and withdrawn from study drug.   Subjects who meet one of the other protocol definitions of an asthma related event should also be considered to have lack of efficacy and be considered for withdraw from study drug.  Instances where the Investigator feels that a subject meeting these criteria should continue receiving study drug should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the medical monitor.   Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from study drug should be followed up as instructed in the schedule of assessments.

For the timing of assessments and procedures throughout the study, refer to the schedule of assessments (Table 1). Throughout the study, every reasonable effort should be made by [CONTACT_88954]. Visits performed after Visit [ADDRESS_545460] misses a study visit for any reason, the visit should be rescheduled as soon as possible. Permitted visit windows are noted in the schedule of assessments (Table 1). In the event a subject cannot be in-clinic for a study visit after randomization due to pandemic, natural disaster, or other kinds of unforeseeable situations, sites should attempt to complete as many visit procedures as possible that can be done remotely, by [CONTACT_431149]/video, on time and per protocol windows. This includes completion of study-required questionnaires which should be provided to the subject or reviewed via phone prior to the visit, if possible, so that the subject can be prepared with appropriate responses.  The medical monitor should be consulted for decisions regarding dosing, laboratory testing, and other protocol procedures which are unable to be done remotely.  If a visit is done remotely, it should be documented as such in subject source records.

 10.1 Study Duration AVTX-002 and placebo treatment will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 0), Visit 5 (Day 28), and Visit 7 (Day 56). A subject may not be dosed after Day 56. The duration of the treatment period is considered [ADDRESS_545461]’s overall NEA history will be captured at Screening. This includes but is not limited to the approximate date of diagnosis and prior treatment including approximate start and stop dates.  10.2.2 Efficacy Efficacy response will be assessed by [CONTACT_431168] (Table 1). [IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Related Events The proportion of patients who experience any of the following asthma related events and time to the asthma related event will be determined:  o  ≥6 additional reliever puffs of SABA (compared to baseline) in a 24-hour period on 2 consecutive days or, • Baseline SABA use (defined as the number of individual puffs or inhalations taken by [CONTACT_423]) will be determined by [CONTACT_431147] 7 days preceding Visit 2, o increase in ICS dose ≥4 times than the dose at baseline or, • Baseline ICS dose is defined as the dosage the subject received during the 30-day run-in period, o a decrease in peak flow of 30% or more (compared to baseline) on 2 consecutive days of treatment or, • Baseline peak flow will be determined by [CONTACT_431151] 7 days preceding Visit 2. o an asthma exacerbation requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least [ADDRESS_545462] day of the event above to denote the day of the overall asthma related event occurrence.  Subjects meeting any of the above criteria for an asthma related event will be permitted to restart background (pre-study) therapy, or alternate asthma therapy. If background/alternate therapy is reinitiated/started, the patient must be withdrawn from the study.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_1814] 1 Second (FEV1) The FEV1 is the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second, measured in liters by a spi[INVESTIGATOR_431141] a percent of expected volume. [IP_ADDRESS] Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) A FeNO test measures the levels of nitric oxide during exhalation. A FeNO test will be done by [CONTACT_431169] a tube attached to a hand-held monitor. [IP_ADDRESS] Peak Flow Meter A peak flow meter measures how well lungs are able to expel air. Subjects will measure peak flow daily on a device provided by [CONTACT_431170]. The site will monitor the diary entries closely to assess subject compliance. Subjects who are not compliant with the diary will be counseled by [CONTACT_431150] 80% is reached.   [IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) This is a simple questionnaire to measure the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control. ACQ has a multidimensional construct assessing symptoms (5 items, self-administered), rescue bronchodilator use (1 item, self-administered), and FEV1 (1 item, completed by [CONTACT_464]). Scores range between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled) (Juniper et al, 2005). [IP_ADDRESS] Standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S)+12) The AQLQ(S)+12 is a modified version of the standardized AQLQ, which was developed to measure functional impairments experienced by [CONTACT_431171] ≥17 years. The AQLQ(S)+12 is valid for patients aged 12 to 70 years and includes 32 questions in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) (Juniper et al, 1992; Wyrwich et al, 2011). Subjects will be asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and score each of the questions on a 7-point scale, where 7=not at all limited and 1=totally limited. The overall score of the AQLQ +12 will be derived as the average of the 32 questions; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates "total impairment") to 7 (indicates "no impairment"). [IP_ADDRESS] Asthma Symptom Diary The Asthma Symptom Diary is a 6-item daily measure of asthma symptom severity that assesses three core categories of asthma symptoms: breathing symptoms (difficulty breathing; wheezing; shortness of breath), chest symptoms (chest tightness; chest pain), and cough. The Asthma Symptom Diary is intended for twice daily completion and comprises a morning diary (for completion upon waking and referring to asthma symptoms during the nighttime) and an evening diary (for completion before going to bed and referring to asthma symptoms during the day). Subjects are required to rate the [ADDRESS_545463] during the respective timeframes using an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (‘None’) to 10 (‘As bad as you can imagine’) (FDA, n.d.). The site will monitor the diary entries closely to assess subject compliance. Subjects who are not compliant with the diary will be counseled by [CONTACT_431150] 80% is reached.   [IP_ADDRESS] European Quality of Life – 5 Dimension 5 level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 38 of 58  
 VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the subject’s self-rated health on a vertical VAS, where the endpoints are labelled ‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’ (EuroQol, 2017). [IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Impression of Change/Severity The Patient Global Impression of Change or Severity (PGI-C, PGI-S) scale is a global index that can be used to rate the severity of a specific condition (a single-state scale) from the patient’s perspective. The PGI-C is a single question scale asking the patient to rate the overall status of their specific condition on a 7-point scale. The PGI-S is a single question scale asking the patient to rate current state of their specific condition on a 7-point scale. [IP_ADDRESS] Clinician Global Impression of Improvement/Severity The Clinician Global Impression of Improvement or Severity (CGI-I, CGI-S) is a global index that can be used to rate the severity of a specific condition (a single-state scale) from the clinician’s perspective. The CGI-I is a single question scale asking clinician to rate the overall status of the patient’s specific condition on a 7-point scale since the beginning of the research study. The CGI-S is a single question scale asking the clinician to rate current state of the patient’s specific condition on a 7-point scale.  [IP_ADDRESS] Short-Acting Beta Agonist Use The number of times a short-acting beta agonist (number of inhalations/puffs) is used will be assessed by [CONTACT_431172]. The site will monitor the diary entries closely to assess subject compliance. Subjects who are not compliant with the diary will be counseled by [CONTACT_431150] 80% is reached.    10.2.3 Safety Safety and tolerability assessments will include the frequency and severity of AEs as well as the evaluation of changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination findings.

 [IP_ADDRESS].4 Evaluation of Laboratory Values The normal ranges of values for the central laboratory assessments in this study will be provided to each site as part of the lab manual. For assessments performed locally, the normal ranges of values for the local laboratory will be provided to the Sponsor’s designee. They will be regarded as the reference ranges on which decisions will be made for the specific site. If a laboratory value is out of the reference range, it is not necessarily clinically relevant. The investigator must evaluate the out-of-range values and record his/her assessment of the clinical relevance in the subject’s source documentation. All laboratory values which, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], show clinically relevant or pathological changes during or after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the medical monitor, as necessary, and reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 11.1.1. All measurements described in this section are recognized standard methods. [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Examinations  [IP_ADDRESS].1 Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13581], and Temperature Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], height, and body weight, will be collected as shown in the schedule of assessments (see Table 1). Pre-dose vital signs should be taken within [ADDRESS_545465] safety and accurate recording of vital sign measurements. Any changes from baseline deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_431173].  [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_545466] has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] 5 minutes, at time points shown in the schedule of assessments (see Table 1). All ECG recordings will be identified with the subject number, date, and time of the recording and a copy will be included with the subject’s source documentation. All ECG values which, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], show clinically relevant or pathological changes during or after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the medical monitor and reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 11.1.1. [IP_ADDRESS].3 Physical Examination, Weight, and Height A complete physical examination, including measurements of height and weight, will be conducted by a qualified licensed physician, physician’s assistant, or a nurse practitioner at Visit 1 through Visit 9/ET (see Table 1). Any clinically significant physical examination findings are to be reported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 11.1.1. Height will be measured only at Visit 1.  [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE described below. At each visit, the subject will be allowed time to spontaneously report any issues since the last visit or evaluation. Any clinically relevant observations made during each visit will also be considered AEs. AEs will 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.[ADDRESS_545467] study visit. 10.2.4 Immunogenicity Analyses Blood samples for ADA analysis will be collected at time points shown in the schedule of assessments (see Table 1). The Visit [ADDRESS_545468] in the laboratory manual(s) and guidance(s). ADA sample analysis will be performed by a laboratory defined in the laboratory manual(s) and guidance(s), according to their standard operating procedures (SOPs) using a validated method. Assay and analysis details will be described in the method validation and bioanalytical information.  10.2.5 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Biomarker Assessments Blood samples will be collected for assessment of PK, PD activity and mechanism of action of AVTX- 002 in NEA. Blood samples will be used to isolate serum, which will be subjected to analysis of soluble LIGHT levels in circulation using a relevant immunoassay for PD activity measures. Additionally, for a selected subset of sites or subjects, sputum samples will be analyzed for soluble LIGHT levels and gene expression. Biomarkers associated with inflammation such as (including but not limited to) IL-6, IFN-y, and TNF-α may be evaluated using relevant immunoassays. Serum may be also used for novel biomarkers analyses as the rationale evolves. Blood samples collected for PBMC isolation may be used for comprehensive immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_431143]- 002 on these cell types. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis may be performed in PBMC as needed. All these exploratory biomarkers as listed in Table 1 will be performed at the laboratories specified in the laboratory manual(s) and/or guidance(s).  [ADDRESS_545469]. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the product, whether related to the product. An AE will be considered treatment-emergent if it occurs after the first dose of investigational product and within [ADDRESS_545470]’s last dose of investigational product. Additionally, an AE that occurred prior to dosing with study medication and increased in severity after start of dosing and within [ADDRESS_545471]’s last dose of investigational product will also be considered treatment emergent. All AEs are collected from the time of the informed consent is signed until the end of study (Day 98/ET). This includes events occurring regardless of whether investigational product is administered. Note: Clinically significant observations noted during screening procedures (labs, physical examination, vital signs, etc.) should be entered as medical history. Only if the clinically 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 42 of 58  
 significant observation is clearly related to the performance of a screening procedure should it be entered as an AE (e.g., a hematoma because of drawing blood for screening labs). Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each symptom should be listed individually. All AEs must be followed to closure, regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached or stabilization achieved (i.e. the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event). When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of an event(s) can be documented.  Events that meet the protocol definition of an asthma related event are captured as part of the primary efficacy endpoint for the study, and therefore need not be recorded as an AE unless they meet the definition of an SAE.  Asthma exacerbations that do not meet the protocol definition of an asthma related event should be captured as AEs. An AE that changes in severity over time should be recorded in the eCRF once at the highest severity with two exceptions: • Worsening of non-NEA-related pre-treatment events after initiation of investigational product must be recorded as new AEs. E.g., if the subject experiences mild, intermittent headaches prior to dosing with investigational product; however, the headache intensity increases to moderate after the first dose of investigational product, a new AE of moderate intermittent headaches is to be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. • An AE which begins as a non-serious event, which later meets the definition of an SAE, should be entered once for the non-serious portion of the AE, and then be re-recorded as a new event with the start date the day it became serious.  11.2 Severity of Adverse Events The medical assessment of clinical severity of an AE will be determined using the definitions outlined in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 (Published November 27, 2017, by [CONTACT_297409], National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute): Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; or clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated Grade 2 Moderate; or minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; or disabling; or limiting self-care ADL Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; or urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 Death related to AE The above grading guidelines should be used whenever possible. For AEs that cannot be graded using CTCAE, the severity should be graded using mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), life threatening (Grade 4), and fatal (Grade 5). Please refer to the above-referenced CTCAE document for full description of CTCAE terms and instrumental and self-care ADLs. It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 43 of 58  
 described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  11.2.[ADDRESS_545472]. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, the AE should be categorized per the guidelines below. The causality assessment must be documented in the source document and the eCRF (Table 3). Table 3: Assessment of Relationship to Investigational Product  Relationship Description Not Related Exposure to investigational product has not occurred. OR The administration of investigational product and the occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time OR The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the investigational product, that is, there are no facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the investigational product. Possibly Related The administration of the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time. AND The AE could not be explained equally well by [CONTACT_431174]. AND The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_431175]. AE = adverse event.

AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.[ADDRESS_545473] corresponding source documents. This information is to be sent to the CRO Pharmacovigilance Department by e-mail as noted below. For questions on SAE reporting, please e-mail the drug safety mailbox noted below. •  [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event Definition An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, whether considered to be related to investigational product or not, that at any dose: • Results in death. • Is life-threatening. NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. NOTE: Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] [ADDRESS_545474] drug, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition or event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103866], organization, or accommodation problems and without medical background does not need to be considered an SAE. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. • Is a congenital anomaly. NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the investigational product during pregnancy is an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has received an investigational product is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the investigational product(s) interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. • Is an important medical event. NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31348]. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs, regardless of the relationship to study, are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the End of Study/Early Termination Visit. The investigator or designee must report all SAEs promptly to CRO within [ADDRESS_545475] becoming aware of the event. Any SAE(s), regardless of relationship to study, which occurred during the study but is not discovered by [CONTACT_431177] [ADDRESS_545476] awareness of the event. Please see individual study site documentation (study binder) for forms and contact [CONTACT_8972].  [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.0 17OCT2022 Page 45 of 58  
 The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution date is the date an outcome is reached or stabilization is achieved (i.e. the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event).  Any signs or symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_431178] (if applicable) or leading up to the onset date of the SAE or following the resolution date of the SAE must be recorded as an AE.  11.2.[ADDRESS_545477]’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. Any AE that results in the subject’s death must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. AEs resulting in death must be reported within [ADDRESS_545478]’s death, data should be collected on whether the death occurred after the withdrawal of care and, if so, the reason for the withdrawal of care. For other AEs, ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. 11.[ADDRESS_545479] dose of study drug, and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., <1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as oral/injectable/inserted/implanted/ transdermal contraceptives, condom with diaphragm, condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine hormone-releasing system or IUD, or sexual abstinence. Contraception is not required where at least [ADDRESS_545480] passed since sterilization, defined as females having undergone one of the following surgeries: hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]; and males who are vasectomized. Contraception is not required where females are postmenopausal (12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea and age ≥51 years). Females and males with female partners should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_431179]. Pregnancy testing will be conducted on every female as per the schedule of assessments (Table 1). A female who is found to be pregnant at screening will be excluded from the study and considered to be a screening failure. A female who is found to be pregnant after receiving investigational product is required to be discontinued from the study and the end of study visit assessments performed as soon as possible after learning of the pregnancy. The investigator must report the pregnancy of any female (study participant or female partner of male study participant) who becomes pregnant during investigational product treatment or within [ADDRESS_545481] (permission must be obtained from the pregnant female partner of a male subject to follow the pregnancy to conclusion and report the results). The pregnancy must be reported within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy to the CRO 
Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. AVTX-002-NEA-201 CONFIDENTIAL Version: 5.[ADDRESS_545482] the designated individual(s) who receive pregnancy notification and record information related to the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Form/other designated form provided by [CONTACT_4885]. The investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. These findings must be reported on the Pregnancy Data Collection Form and forwarded to the designated individual(s). The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous abortion or a congenital anomaly.  11.3.[ADDRESS_545483]/Ethics Committee (EC) and Site The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities and if applicable, US central institutional review board (IRB) of related, unexpected SAEs. In addition, the Sponsor and the CRO are responsible for notifying active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the development program. The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local ethics committee (EC), or the relevant local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his/her site, as required.  12 STATISTICS  12.1 Sample Size Determination The sample size in this study will be approximately 80 with 40 subjects per treatment arm, randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_545484], rates of 6% in the active group and 44% in the placebo group were observed (Wenzel, 2013). If these estimates were used as is, then a study with [ADDRESS_545485] over 95% power.  Considering likely variations from the cited study, estimates of sample were assessed assuming a Type I error of 5% and the proportion of subjects with an asthma related event ranging from 30% to 50% in the placebo group and 5% to 8% in the active group. In the 20 such scenarios examined, only in the cases in which the difference between treatments gets below 23% does the power fall slightly below 80%. In the vast majority of cases examined the power is greater than 90%. A sample size re-estimation may be performed at a point in time when an adequate number of subjects has been enrolled to provide meaningful data.  Details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.     12.[ADDRESS_545486]: • The Randomized Analysis Set will include all subjects who are randomized in the study.

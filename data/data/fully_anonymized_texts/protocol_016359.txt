LaySummary of Proposed Research
Lay Summary of Proposed Research
Depression is theleading cause of disability globally (1, 2). One-third toone-half of patients
suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) do not achieve remission even after multiple
antidepressant trials (3). Ketamine is a commonly-used FDA-approved anesthetic medication thatat subanesthetic doses leads torapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal ideation effects in hours,
rather than weeks, following administration. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_393635], a key limitation ofketamine treatment is that it only yields an antidepressant response in approximately 50% of
those treated. Thegoal of this project is to A) elucidate ketamine’s mechanism of action and B)
identify biomarkers predicting treatment outcome toketamine which could be used tomatch
patients totreatment based on thelikelihood of effectiveness at theindividual level. Data from
animal models suggests that ketamine acts by [CONTACT_795400] a process known as synaptic plasticity (4-7), and that these biological changes are
responsible for the sustained behavioral effects of ketamine (8). A newly available tool allows us
toimage thedensity of these synaptic connections in theliving brain using PET imaging with a
radiotracer called [
11C]UCB-J, which is a marker of synaptic density. Wepropose todirectly
quantify synaptic density in depressed patients before and after a course of ketamine, toexamine
changes in density following treatment. Inexploratory analyses, we will examine synaptic density
as a mediator of thesustained antidepressant effects of ketamine and as a predictor of treatment

[ADDRESS_1097221] (A: elucidate ketamine’s 
mechanism of action; B: identify biomarkers predicting treatment outcome to ketamine), we 
propose to add non-invasive and cost-effective neurophysiological measures to the study protocol. 
Electroencephalogram (EEG) will be obtained at baseline and after ketamine treatment during two 
standard paradigms (at rest with eyes open/closed, loudness-dependent auditory evoked 
potentials [LDAEP]) that have shown 1) predictive utility for antidepressant treatment response 
and 2) sensitivity to ketamine administration.
Background, Significance and  Rationale
Background, Significance and Rationale
            Depression  is the leading cause of disability globally (1, 2). One-third to one-half of 
patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) do not achieve remission even after 
multiple antidepressant trials (3). Ketamine is a commonly-used FDA-approved anesthetic and 
non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist. Recent 
randomized trials demonstrate that subanesthetic doses of ketamine lead to rapid antidepressant 
and anti-suicidal ideation effects in individuals with MDD and bipolar depression (reviewed in (9)). 
In contrast to current FDA-approved antidepressants, ketamine exerts antidepressant effects in 
hours, rather than weeks, following administration. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_393635], a key 
limitation of ketamine treatment is that it only yields an antidepressant response in approximately 
50% of those treated. In addition, ketamine’s clinical utility is limited by [CONTACT_795401], a one to two-week duration of action as monotherapy, its addictive potential, and long-
term safety concerns related to cognition and interstitial cystitis (9-11). Given the profound benefit 
of ketamine for some individuals yet these key limitations, developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a precision medicine 
research strategy for ketamine’s antidepressant effects could be of tremendous scientific and 
clinical benefit, in order to A) elucidate ketamine’s mechanism of action, to advance the 
development of safer alternative agents and B) identify biomarkers predicting treatment outcome 
to ketamine, which could be used to match patients to treatment based on the likelihood of 
effectiveness at the individual level.
            There is evidence of brain atrophy in depression: gray matter volume is reduced in the 
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and in the hippocampus (HC) in depressed individuals (12). Postmortem 
studies in depression show low expression of several genes related to synaptic function and 
decreased synapse number in the dorsolateral PFC (13). Chronic stress, a risk factor for 
depression, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_795368] (14, 15). Pre-
clinical work in rodents suggests that ketamine may exert antidepressant effects by [CONTACT_795402], specifically through the formation of new dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_795369]. 
In rodents, ketamine induces rapid synaptogenesis via stimulation of mechanistic target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), leading to a reversal of chronic, 
stress-induced neuronal atrophy (4-7).

            A  recently developed research tool enables examination of synaptic density in vivo in 
humans. [11C]UCB-J is a PET radiotracer that is specific for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A 
(SV2A) (16, 17), providing a quantitative measure of synaptic density in vivo in the brain in 
humans.  A recent PET imaging pi[INVESTIGATOR_795370] [11C]UCB-J binding in the PFC of 
individuals with current MDD as compared to healthy volunteers, providing early evidence that this 
synaptic density biomarker may quantify a disease-relevant process in depression (18). 
Furthermore, PET imaging with [11C]UCB-J displays outstanding test-retest reliability, with 
absolute test-retest variability of only 4-5% in brain regions of interest in this study (19), making it 
an outstanding tool for longitudinal studies of the effects of treatment interventions. We therefore 
propose to directly quantify synaptic density in depressed patients to investigate whether it is 
increased by [CONTACT_795403] a regionally-specific manner.  Moreover, we will examine 
synaptic density as a mediator of the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine and as a 
predictor of treatment outcome.   We will quantify synaptic density using PET imaging before and 
after a course of 4 sequential intravenous infusions of ketamine administered over a two-week 
period.
            Two  oscillatory measures derived from resting EEG, midfrontal (anterior cingulate) theta 
and posterior (occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-parietal) alpha, have been identified as putative EEG biomarkers of 
treatment outcome in depression (e.g., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2001, 2018; Smith et al., 2019; Tenke et 
al., 2011). Studies of ketamine in healthy participants and MDD patients also highlight the 
important role of these frontal and posterior regions. For example, ketamine administration in 
healthy participants increased activation in frontal brain regions (ACC, dlPFC, mPFC), including 
specific increases in ventral ACC theta activity and decreases at posterior regions (PCC, TPJ; 
McMillan et al., 2019; Mueller et al., 2019; see Curic et al., 2019). Studies of post-ketamine effects 
in MDD patients showed increases and normalization of dorsal-frontal PFC activity (Abdallah et 
al., 2017; Ionescu et al., 2019) and decreases of hyperactive bottom-up salience-related regions 
such as rACC and INS (Reed et al., 2019). Further, resting EEG studies of ketamine showed 
decreases in dominant (posterior-parietal) alpha oscillations and increases of slower (theta) and 
faster (gamma) oscillations, that is, increased frontal theta, decreased parietal-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_795371], and increases in global gamma (McMillan et al., 2019; Muthukumaraswamy et al., 
2015; Vlisides et al., 2018; Zacharias et al., 2019). 
            Data from animal models suggest that the LDAEP slope of the auditory N1/P2 amplitude 
(monotonic increase with increasing intensity) is indicative of serotonergic function (e.g., Hegerl et 
al., 1994, 2001), and several LDAEP studies reported a differential prediction of clinical response 
to serotonergic versus noradrenegric and placebo treatment (Gallinat et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2015; 
Mulert et al., 2002; Paige et al., 1994, 1995). Moreover, NMDA receptor blockade in monkeys 
blunted the LDAEP response, suggesting that the NMDA antagonist ketamine will likewise result 
in a blunted LDAEP response (i.e., shallower slope; Teichert, 2017). Use of the LDAEP in this 
project will increase knowledge regarding ERP studies of ketamine in humans, which revealed a 
general pattern of reduced cognitive ERPs (N2, P2, P3, MMN) but equivocal findings regarding 
ketamine-related increases and decreases in sensory ERPs (P50, P1, N1; Rosburg et al., 2016; 
Rosch et al., 2019; Schwertner et al., 2018).
            Brain connectivity studies related to ketamine in healthy humans showed decreased 
functional connectivity (FC) across frontal, parietal, insular, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96061], including 
decreased within-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_795372], and increases in delta and theta frontal-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_795373]
7847

as low  beta FC between frontal and precuneus/insula regions (Forsyth et al., 2019). After 
ketamine, MDD patients show decreased dlPFC-ACC connectivity as well as increased within-
frontal, PFC-PCC and DMN-Salience connectivity (Abdallah et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2018; 
Fleming et al., 2019). Related work with healthy humans during ketamine showed decreased FC 
across frontal, parietal, insular, and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96061], including decreased within-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_795374], and increases in delta and theta frontal-occipi[INVESTIGATOR_795375]/insula regions (Forsyth et al., 2019). Studies examining predictors of ketamine 
treatment response in MDD suggested that baseline and event-related lPFC-sgACC connectivity 
(Gartner et al., 2019), higher rostral ACC response to fearful faces (Salvadore et al., 2009) and 
higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better antidepressant treatment 
response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma (Nugent et al., 2019).
            Obtaining these EEG and ERP data will allow us to link relevant metrics to treatment 
response as well as to synaptic density. Specifically, changes in synaptic density should impact on 
functional connections between cortical regions (neuronal dynamics) and LDAEP component 
topographies (scalp or sensor-level radial current flow estimates; Tenke & Kayser, 2012) and 
tomographies (distributed inverses; Pascual-Marqui et al., 1994).
 
Specific Aims  and Hypotheses
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
AIM 1:  Quantify changes in regional synaptic density in response to intravenous ketamine. We 
hypothesize that administration of ketamine in individuals with MDD will induce new spi[INVESTIGATOR_795376], reflected by [CONTACT_795404] V T derived from PET imaging with [11C]UCB-J 
performed prior to and approximately 24 hours following a course of four ketamine infusions.
 
AIM 2:  Evaluate the relationship between sustained improvement in depressive symptoms in 
response to intravenous ketamine and change in 11C-UCB-J binding. We hypothesize that the 
magnitude of the change in 11C-UCB-J V T in mPFC and HC in response to intravenous ketamine 
administration will correlate with clinical improvement on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
from baseline to one week following the final ketamine infusion.
 
AIM 3:  Examine whether baseline synaptic density in MDD-relevant brain regions as measured by 
[CONTACT_795405] [11C]UCB-J predicts the magnitude of sustained antidepressant effects of 
intravenous ketamine treatment. Hypothesis: lower pre-treatment [11C]UCB-J binding (V T) in 
mPFC and HC will predict greater improvement in depressive symptoms assessed one week 
following final ketamine infusion as assessed by [CONTACT_40424].  This aim 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_1097222] particular deficits in this biological 
measure (regionally-specific synaptic density) will benefit most from an intervention that acts to 
restore such deficits.
 
 
AIM 4:  Examine whether baseline EEG measures (midfrontal theta, posterior alpha, LDAEP slope) 
predict the magnitude of sustained antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine treatment. 
Hypothesis: Greater rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) theta, as identified via low resolution 
brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA; e.g., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2001, 2018), greater posterior 
alpha as identified via scalp current source density (CSD; surface Laplacian) and frequency 
principal component analysis (fPCA; e.g., Tenke et al., 2011), and greater LDAEP will predict 
greater improvement in depressive symptoms assessed via the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
one week following final ketamine infusion. This aim is based on prior findings showing moderate 
predictive validity of these putative EEG biomarkers of treatment outcomes in depression (e.g., 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2018; Tenke et al., 2011).
 
AIM 5:  Examine whether pre/post ketamine treatment changes of EEG measures (midfrontal 
theta, posterior alpha, LDAEP slope) predict the magnitude of sustained antidepressant effects of 
intravenous ketamine treatment, and whether these changes are related to changes in synaptic 
density. Hypothesis: Ketamine treatment will reduce ERP amplitudes in general and LDAEP slope 
in particular; the extent of this reduction will be correlated with both reduction in depressive 
symptoms and increases in synaptic density. This aim is based on findings showing blunted 
LDAEP response after NMDA blockade (Teichart, 2017), which may be directly related to 
ketamine’s mechanism of action resulting in its antidepressant effects.

Procedures
1. Screening
a. We  will recruit inpatients or outpatients with MDD in a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Referrals 
generally come from physicians, clinics, the NYPH Emergency Department, and ads in media 
including the internet.
b. Participant  completes phone screen, approved under IRB #6879R (which may be done in-
person if in the emergency room or on an inpatient unit). If participant appears eligible based on 
the phone screen, they will be scheduled for a more in-depth screening visit under Screening 
Protocol (IRB #6879R) to determine whether inclusion/exclusion criteria (excluding medical 
screening) are met. Screening will occur via NYSPI-approved remote platforms including Webex, 
Zoom, or telephone.
 
c. Secure  video/phone interviews: Under the procedures described in protocols #4815 and 
#6879R, consent forms for this protocol will be sent to the subject to be reviewed with an 
approved consenter at the end of the eligibility screening. Subjects will be asked to print the form 
prior to their eligibility screening.
 
d.  Secure video/phone interviews: Following the interview conducted under #6879R, the 
consenter will review the consent form for this protocol that was emailed to the subject. Consent 
forms will be signed electronically by [CONTACT_795410].
 
e. Secure  video/phone interviews: Following the procedures detailed in protocol #4815, if the 
consenter determines that the potential subject has suffered a serious head injury a trailmaking 
test (TMT) will be sent to the subject. Research staff will administer the test over secure video as 
described fully in protocol #4815.  
 
f. For in-person  screening procedures (which may be used with patients in the emergency room or 
on an inpatient unit), participant is given a detailed, verbal explanation of this study and IRB #4815 
and given a copy of both consent forms.

g. Participant  gives written informed consent to participate in IRB #4815 and this study.
h. Participant  receives medical evaluation under IRB #4815. Genetics blood sample is also 
acquired under IRB #4815 (Biological and neuropsychological measures for genetic studies of 
psychiatric populations—PI: [INVESTIGATOR_795380]). 
i. An electrocardiogram  will be performed to evaluate any cardiovascular contraindications to 
research procedures. 
j. Final  eligibility is determined when results of laboratory tests acquired through IRB #4815 are 
obtained.
k. During the  period between enrollment and the infusion, the treating physician will
assess the patient weekly in by [CONTACT_648], through secure video, or in person if these options are not 
available, through a clinical interview and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. If concerns are 
noted during a telephone or secure video contact, participants may be brought in for an in-person 
visit. If a participant has a CGI-I >[ADDRESS_1097232] refuses inpatient admission that is deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_795411].
2. Prior  Psychiatric Medication
a. For  insomnia or anxiety, PRN diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], or a
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_511836]. The goal will be the equivalent of a maximum daily dose of 
lorazepam ≤2mg during the week leading to the first infusion. However, no zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], 
zaleplon, or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_795386] [ADDRESS_1097233]-infusion treatment. Minor dose adjustments may be 
made pre-infusion, such as to reduce side effects.
3. Actively  Suicidal Patients
a. Patients  with imminent (next few days) suicidal plan or intent will only be enrolled if they agree 
to acute inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The independent treatment team on the inpatient research unit 
must agree that study participation is clinically reasonable.
b. For patients who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795387],
admission to a NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_511839]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795388]
[ADDRESS_1097234] as not being in 
imminent risk of harm to self/other.
c. A research psychiatrist will be available by [CONTACT_756] 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
Patients requiring urgent admission will be brought to the NewYork Presby[CONTACT_194840]/Columbia 
University Irving Medical Center Emergency Room by [CONTACT_795412], if needed. Non-emergent admissions will be arranged by [CONTACT_316922], if 
possible to [ADDRESS_1097235] agree to inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_511841] (4 Center 
or 5 South units) throughout the period in which the following procedures occur: baseline 
neuroimaging (MRI and PET), ketamine infusions, and post-ketamine imaging (PET). Our goal will 
be for the admission to be as short as possible, but in general we anticipate that it may be on the 
order of 21 days, or more if clinically indicated. Patients will be evaluated by a research physician 
and the inpatient unit’s independent clinical team and will be discharged when assessed, 
according to standard practice, as safe for outpatient treatment in the research clinic. Patients who 
need to be kept involuntarily for safety reasons will be withdrawn from research and treated 
clinically.
5. Pre-Infusion  Research Measures
a. Baseline clinical  and neuropsychological ratings (See Figure 1, attached); may be performed as 
inpatient or outpatient. 
b. Baseline MRI  imaging will take place at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute on a GE 
SIGNA Premier 3T MRI Scanner, generally on a day prior to ketamine infusion, although it may 
take place after the ketamine infusion if scheduling constraints make this preferable.  MR imaging 
will include T1-weighted structural MRI of the brain for coregistration to PET and identification of 
regions of interest.  Resting-state functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging acquisitions may 
be performed if time allows. MRI scanning time will not exceed [ADDRESS_1097236] will be performed on 
women of child-bearing potential on the day of the MRI scan. Inpatients will be accompanied to 
the MRI Center by a research staff member (coordinator, psychologist or psychiatrist) who will 
remain in the MRI Center throughout the scan and bring them back to the inpatient unit at the 
completion of the scan. 
c. Before  the MRI occurs, participants will have the option of visiting the MRI suite and entering a 
mock MRI scanner. The mock scanner is identical in size to an MRI scanner but cannot take 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_212525]. Trying out the mock MRI scanner simulation gives participants an idea of 
what the MRI scan will be like and may reduce their anxiety about the scan.
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_1097237] ketamine infusion; this could include scanning on the 
day of ketamine infusion itself prior to the infusion. PET imaging will be performed at the Columbia 
PET Center. SV2A will be quantified via PET with [11C]UCB-J, synthesized as previously 
described (17). Radiotracer synthesis will occur in the radioligand laboratory at the Columbia PET 
Center.  Baseline PET scanning will occur within one week prior to ketamine infusion. After 
acquisition of a low dose CT scan for attenuation correction, [11C]UCB-J will be injected as an 
intravenous bolus (≤740mBq), and PET data acquired on a Siemens mCT Biograph over [ADDRESS_1097238] will be performed on women of child-bearing potential on the day 
of each PET scan. 
e. Blood Analysis: A radial artery catheter will be placed prior to PET imaging for concurrent blood 
sampling to measure arterial input function and unmetabolized plasma fraction of [11C]UCB-J 
using high-performance liquid chromatography. The radial artery catheter will be placed by a 
physician after completion of the Allen test and infiltration of the skin with 1% lidocaine. If a 
participant has a known allergy to lidocaine, an alternative local anesthetic may be used. Blood 
samples will be drawn using a combination of automated and/or manual blood sampling during the 
course of the PET scan.  No more than [ADDRESS_1097239] the scanner while scanning (e.g. to use the 
bathroom) we will perform an additional low dose CT transmission scan.
 
6. Ketamine  Infusions.
a. Four  Ketamine infusions will be administered over a two-week period with infusions occurring 
approximately on alternating days (such as Tues-Thurs) on each of two weeks; small variations to 
this schedule are allowed if necessitated by [CONTACT_795413]. 
b. Patients  will eat no food for 12 hours and drink no liquids for 4 hours before each infusion.  
Patients will be escorted by [CONTACT_795414] (BSU) at NYSPI, 
where the infusions will occur. 
c. No  zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_795389] 24 hours prior to each ketamine 
infusion. We will monitor patients for signs of withdrawal, such as severe anxiety, diaphoresis, 
tachycardia (HR greater than 100), or hypertension (BP greater than 150/95).
Protocol Summary Form
7847
Miller, Jeffrey
Page 21  of 41
d. We  exclude hypertension at screening. However, patients may be anxious at the ketamine 
procedure, which can transiently raise BP. We will check subjects’ BP approximately [ADDRESS_1097240] the patient do relaxation exercises.  If these are ineffective, 
the patient will be given amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 5mg po.  We will allow start of the infusion with BP of 150/95 
or less.
e. Intravenous  catheter will be placed by [CONTACT_795415] a MIND physician or nurse, 
including Jayamole Kannamkuzhiyil. 
f. Dose: Patients will receive an intravenous infusion of saline solution with ketamine hydrochloride 
(0.5 mg/kg; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) over the course of approximately 40 minutes 
in the BSU of NYSPI, with a study physician present at the beginning of the infusion and 
available throughout.
g. Vital Signs Monitoring: During study infusion(s), blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen 
saturation will be monitored as follows:
i. -5 minutes
ii. 0 (start of infusion)
iii. Post start of infusion: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 minutes (end of infusion)
iv. Post end of infusion: Blood pressure will continue to be obtained until there are two 
measurements at least [ADDRESS_1097241] 15 minutes apart that are within normal limits (02 
saturation of 94% or greater).
h. The research assistant will remain outside the patients room during the infusion, and will 
record vital signs. A study physician will be available at all times . After the subject is 
transferred back to their inpatient unit room, the blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained 
manually by [CONTACT_511863].
i. Intervention for Hypertension: If the systolic blood pressure increases to ≥ 200 or diastolic blood 
pressure increases to ≥115 mmHg during the ketamine infusion, the infusion will be discontinued. 
The blood pressure will be monitored and if there is no decrease after 15 minutes, then we will 
initiate the following treatment interventions, consistent with our previous IRB-approved ketamine 
studies including IRB #6598:
1) One dose  of sublingual nitroglycerine, 0.3 mg, will be administered.
2) If there is no response within 10 minutes, clonidine 0.1 mg po will be administered
every 30 minutes (total maximum dose 0.6 mg clonidine) until the desired blood
pressure is reached. Desired blood pressure is defined as within normal range or 10
mmHg of baseline diastolic reading.
3) If high blood pressure is symptomatic, i.e., blurred vision, headache, chest pain, the
subject will be transferred to the ER at [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307]. If they do not respond to 
the above treatment (1 and 2 above) then they will be transferred to the ER.
 
7. Post-infusion Neuroimaging:
Protocol Summary Form
7847
Miller, Jeffrey
Page 22  of 41
a. PET  imaging with [11C]UCB-J, performed identically as described above, will be repeated as 
close to 24-48 hours following the 4th ketamine infusion as is possible with scheduling availability 
of the PET Center. If participants do not complete all four ketamine infusions for any reason 
(including adverse effects of ketamine, lack of clinical response and preference not to complete all 
sessions, etc), we may conduct repeat (post-ketamine) [11C]UCB-J PET scan after fewer 
ketamine administrations.
8. Post-Infusion Treatment:
Pharmacologic treatment  will proceed as follows at the conclusion of post-infusion PET and MRI 
acquisition:
Study participants  will receive six months of open clinical treatment in the form of:
a)    Continuation of inpatient treatment  for as long as is clinically indicated, followed by
b)    Outpatient psychiatrist  visits for medication management with a psychiatrist in MIND to complete a 
total of 6 months of psychiatric care inclusive of the inpatient stay.
 
9. Exploratory research assessments  of mood, suicidality, and side effects (per Fig. 1) Research 
assessments will  continue for a three-week continuation phase post-infusion. Continuation phase 
clinical appointments will be weekly for four weeks, then decreasing to at least monthly, as 
clinically indicated, for the remainder of the six months.
 
Research assessments  may be performed using phone or secure video (Webex or Zoom) and 
using Internet-based encrypted systems including Redcap or Citrix, managed by [CONTACT_795416]/Columbia School of Public Health Data Coordination Center (DCC).

Research Related  Delay to Treatment
Will research procedures result in a delay to treatment?
Yes
Maximum
 duration of delay to any treatment 
Patients on  an antidepressant regimen at enrollment will continue their current antidepressant 
regimen; there will be no delay to that ongoing treatment for those participants. The delay to 
inpatient admission will not exceed 3 weeks; if a participant needs a longer delay between 
consent and beginning treatment for logistical reasons, it will be determined by [CONTACT_795417] a case-by-case basis based on need for delay, clinical stability, and ability to comply with the 
plan for monitoring. This period allows the time required for processing lab samples, completion of 
baseline research measures, and scheduling inpatient admission, the infusion procedures in the 
BSU, PET, and MRI procedures. 
 
The delay to  ketamine infusion will not exceed [ADDRESS_1097244]-ketamine PET scan is completed; this will not exceed [ADDRESS_1097245]-infusion PET and MRI 
acquisition:
Study participants  will receive six months of open clinical treatment in the form of:
a)    Continuation of inpatient treatment  for as long as is clinically indicated, followed by
b)    Outpatient psychiatrist  visits for medication management with a psychiatrist in MIND to complete a 
total of [ADDRESS_1097246], such as numerous approved antidepressant medications, 
electroconvulsive therapy, and various evidence-based psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that could be encountered during the study period
1. PET  Scan-Related Risks:
1A. Radiotracer 
1A. Radiation exposure  (PET)
For [11C]UCB-J, the single scan injected dose limit is 740mBq or 20 mCi, yielding a cumulative 
protocol dose limit over two [11C]UCB-J PET scans of [ADDRESS_1097247] sensitive 
to radiation exposure.

Transmission Scan NOTE:  We plan to do the scans on the mCT scanner where the attenuation 
correction is done with a low-dose CT and therefore there will be a small amount of radiation due 
to the CT. In the event that the subject needs to leave the scanner while scanning (e.g. to use the 
bathroom) we will perform an additional low dose CT transmission scan (maximum total exposure 
from four CT scans ~0.176 mSv). 
1B. Radiotracer physiological  effects:
Consistent with  previous work with [11C]UCB-J (17), we will limit injected mass to 10 micrograms. 
The safety of [11C]UCB-J at similar injected masses has been demonstrated in PET studies 
published in the literature, including 10 healthy volunteers and 3 individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_795392] (17); five of whom received repeat [11C]UCB-J injections and scans the same day (20).  
Another study performed PET imaging with [11C]UCB-J on 10 individuals with amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment and 11 individuals who were cognitively normal (21).  The risk of an 
idiosyncratic reaction is acknowledged in the consent form. A physician will be available at the 
time of each injection of the radiotracer. Any adverse reaction to the radioactive drug (radiation 
related or not) will be reported to the NYPSI IRB and the JRSC.
1C. Placement  of Intra-arterial catheter 
Radial arterial  catherization is needed for repeated arterial blood samples to construct tracer input 
curves. Complications resulting from such short-term catheterizations include bleeding, occlusion, 
clotting, or infection. 
The following  paragraph appears in the subject consent forms as per the IRB website, with one 
phrase added [shown here in italics] for more clarity for participants with lack of mathematical 
skills: 
Protocol Summary Form
7847
Miller, Jeffrey
Page 30  of 41
“The placement  of a catheter in your artery may cause discomfort. There is a very small chance of 
complications from this catheter such as bleeding, bruising, infection or blood clot. There is an 
extremely low risk (0.09%, or about 1 in a thousand) of cutting off circulation to your hand which 
could result in a need for surgical repair or, in rare instances, could result in the loss of use of part 
of or all of the hand. These complications are rare and usually occur in medically ill patients who 
have catheters in their wrists for several days. In contrast, the catheter will remain in your arm for 
about four hours for this study. If you have a history of a bleeding disorder or are taking certain 
medications that affect blood clotting, you will not be asked to participate in this study.”
The radial  artery catheter is placed by [CONTACT_255958]. 
1D. Intravenous  catheter (PET, ketamine infusion)
There is  a small risk of infection and bleeding associated with intravenous catheters, which are 
prevented by [CONTACT_542986]. Placement of IVs will be by a physician, nurse, or technician 
trained and certified in aseptic technique for catheter placement to minimize this risk.
1E. Blood Drawing (PET, screening)
The risks  associated with drawing blood are slight discomfort and occasional bruising. The total 
volume drawn through enrollment in this study and co-enrollment in our area’s umbrella protocol, 
IRB #4815, is 243ml, which is less than the volume drawn during blood donation.  We exclude 
individuals who are anemic with a Hemoglobin value <11 g/dL for females or <12 g/dL for males.
1F. Discomfort  during scanning (PET and MRI) 
It may  be uncomfortable to lie motionless in the cameras (either PET or MRI) and it may cause 
some subjects to feel anxious. Our staff will be available to provide support, reduce anxiety, 
optimize the comfort of the subject and remove the subject from the scanner if requested. A 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_795393]. 
1G. Pregnancy  (PET, MRI, Ketamine)
Studies involving  radiation are contraindicated during pregnancy because of possible risk to the 
fetus. Patients must agree at the time of consent to use an effective form of birth control and to 
inform the treating psychiatrist in the event of pregnancy while in the study. Women of child-
bearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test administered as part of initial eligibility 
assessments, as well as urine pregnancy tests performed on the day of the PET and MRI scans 
prior to scanning, and within a day prior to each ketamine infusion. On the day of the PET 
scan, research staff will ask female participants whether they have had sex without birth control 
within two weeks of the PET scan. If they have, they will not be scanned that day. An additional 
urine pregnancy test will be administered one to two weeks after the second PET scan. The post-
PET pregnancy test can be completed at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_4388] a take home urine pregnancy test (test kit 
to be provided by [CONTACT_3476]) with email the subject informing the research team of the 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_1097250]. In addition, nursing mothers will also 
be excluded from the study. 
2. Side  Effects of Intravenous Ketamine.
2A. Medical Risks related to Ketamine
Administration of  sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine i.v., such as the 0.5 mg/kg dose to be used in 
this study, may induce a modest rise in blood pressure. We have administered sub-anesthetic 
doses of ketamine i.v. (0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) in the setting of an IRB-approved MRI/MRS 
brain imaging protocol at this institution (IRB #5786, PI: J. Mann). The modest increases all 
peaked and largely resolved by 75 minutes, with vitals returning to near baseline. 
In addition,  ketamine may produce nausea and vomiting.
Procedures for minimizing  risks related to Ketamine infusion:
Any medical risks from increased blood pressure will be minimized through the careful screening 
of potential subjects. Subjects will be excluded for baseline hypertension or any history of 
cardiovascular illness. A BLS-certified physician who has been trained in the infusion procedure 
will be present during the procedure. Procedures for hypertension that occurs during the infusion 
are described above under Study Procedures. Nausea and vomiting will be treated supportively 
and, if severe, with anti-emetic agents; if necessary, administration of ketamine will be 
discontinued. Subject will be informed that they should be fasting (12 hours no food, 4 hours no 
liquids) prior to the ketamine infusion. 
2B. Psychiatric  or Behavioral Risks Related to Ketamine
Ketamine is  an FDA-approved dissociative anesthetic. Ketamine exposure at the sub-anesthetic 
dose to be used in this study can be associated with a moderate dissociative state, which is well 
tolerated in the majority of cases and is spontaneously reversible (22). There is extensive clinical 
experience with ketamine used at anesthetic doses, and no long-term detrimental effects of 
ketamine exposure have been reported. It is possible that ketamine administration will increase 
the risk of psychosis, even in normal subjects. Ketamine is a street drug of abuse. As such, it 
poses the risk that exposure during this study may predispose subjects to subsequent abuse of 
this drug. To minimize this risk, current drug or alcohol dependence or any history of ketamine 
abuse or dependence will be excluded. We will follow patients while they are receiving clinical 
treatment and review any evidence of abuse that may appear after the ketamine infusion. This 
dose of ketamine has been safely administered in similar settings to depressed patients with 
clinically significant suicidal ideation at least 23 times without any serious side effects (23, 24).
iv) Specific measures and precautions
The experiment will be carried out in the presence of at least one psychiatrist. In case of agitation, 
hyperarousal, or psychosis, the participant will be treated with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (lorazepam) or 
neuroleptics, as indicated.The risks of exposing subjects to a drug of abuse potential will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_511869], and by [CONTACT_795418].

[ADDRESS_1097251] metal in their body 
(e.g. shrapnel or surgical prostheses) which may be affected by [CONTACT_40427]. Patients will be 
asked to notify us if this is the case. There is also the risk of burns from medicinal patches during 
the MRI; therefore, subjects will be asked to remove any patches prior to the scanning session. 
Although there are no known risks associated with pregnancy, we will not scan someone who is 
known to be pregnant. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy testing will 
be conducted on the day of the MRI. Some people have reported sensations during the MRI scan, 
such as "tingling" or "twitching" (or, very rarely, a painful sensation), which are caused by [CONTACT_795419]. If the subject experiences sensations 
and feels uncomfortable, the MR technologist will stop the scan immediately. Occasionally, some 
people experience nervousness or claustrophobic feelings due to the scanner's confined space. In 
our experience, no one has had sensations from the scanning that did not stop as soon as the 
scanning stopped. Except for pacemakers and some types of metallic implants, we know of no 
health hazard from the MRI scan. The MRI scan is not painful, but having to lie still in the enclosed 
space of the scanning table is uncomfortable for some people. 
Because this  MRI scan is being performed for research purposes only, it may not show problems 
that would normally be found in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_795394] a doctor for a specific 
medical problem. The T1-weighted images acquired in this study, regardless of resolution of other 
image characteristics, do not, in general, yield adequate information for a clinical quality read. 
However, gross structural abnormalities such as the presence of mass effects or hydrocephalus 
will be examined and documented by [CONTACT_795420]. Upon request, results 
will be shared with research subjects or a physician designated by [CONTACT_476]. 
4. Electrocardiogram 
An electrocardiogram  has no serious risks. On rare occasions a rash may develop where the 
electrodes are places which usually resolves without treatment. 
5. Interviews  
Interviews: Psychiatric  interviews and neuropsychological testing can sometimes be
boring or stressful, but some people find talking to a physician or psychologist helpful. The 
interviewers will all be experienced personnel. The research team may request permission to 
record the interview for teaching purposes with audiotape and/or videotape. In this event, a 
separate consent process will occur for this. Subjects may choose to postpone or stop the 
interview at any time.
 6. EEG/ERP  Tests
 
The procedures  for measuring EEG are noninvasive and standard for clinical research in this area 
and represent no risk to subjects. Subjects may experience some discomfort when applying the 
electrode cap but this passes quickly. In our prior work, subjects have experienced little difficulty

images, will be protected by a firewall (programming that makes it virtually impossible to access 
the data from outside the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute) and by [CONTACT_795421] a password known only to authorized

federal regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration who may review records as 
part of routine audits. There are also legal advocacy organizations that have authority under New 
York State law to have access to otherwise confidential subject records, although they cannot 
disclose this information without the subject’s consent.

Data will  be de-identified prior to publication in the scientific literature and presentation at scientific 
meetings, 
 
Data collected  in this research study, including MRI and PET scans, measurements from blood 
samples drawn during the PET scan, and questionnaire answers, may be used in future studies, 
and may be shared with other investigators after being de-identified, including in scientific data 
banks.  There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing, but this is 
extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared. 
 
While we  perform analyses of the blood samples that are drawn during the PET scan in this 
protocol, no biospecimens are banked/stored through this research study, and as such, no actual 
biospecimens from this research study will be shared with other investigators (though the results 
of blood assays may be shared as above).
 
All screening  and consenting procedures will be done remotely over a HIPAA-compliant 
videoconferencing software (Webex or Zoom) or telephone. We will document consent 
electronically using Redcap. The consent discussion process will include discussion of the  
HIPAA-compliant, encrypted platforms to be used.  We will discuss any concerns the patient may 
have, such as access to a private space in which to take calls, or accessibility—access at home to 
adequate devices, cell signal, or wifi, and attempt to address these concerns to the best of our 
ability. 
Will the study be conducted under a certificate of confidentiality?
No

Statistical Analysis Plan 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_795399] [11C]UCB-J and clinical outcomes following treatment with ketamine 
infusions for depression.   
Primary aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models.  All tests will be 
performed using two-sided alternatives with alpha=0.05.  For all analyses we will 
examine standard diagnostic plots to identify evidence of lack of model fit, presence of 
outliers or overly influential points, etc., and take appropriate remedies as indicated 
(e.g., review source data of outliers, transform data, etc.). 
As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], additional exploratory analyses will be conducted for hypothesis 
generating purposes.

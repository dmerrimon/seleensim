Acute 
Cellular 
Rejection  Based  on BANFF  2007  Scoring  Criteria.  Grade  1A or higher.  
1. Normal  
 
2. Borderline  changes:  This category  is used  when no intimal  arteritis  is present, 
but there are foci of mild tubulitis (t1, t2, or t3) with minor interstitial infiltration 
(i0, or i1) or interstitial infiltration (i2, i3) with mild (t1) tubulitis.  
 
3. T-cell mediated  rejection  (may  coincide with categories  2 and 5 and 6). 
Acute  T-cell-mediated  rejection  (Type/Grade): 
IA Cases  with significant  interstitial infiltration  (>25%  of parenchyma 
affected, i2 or i3) and foci of moderate tubulitis (t2)  
IB Cases with significant interstitial infiltration (>25% of parenchyma affected,  
i2 or i3) and foci of severe tubulitis (t3)  
IIA Cases  with mild-to-moderate intimal arteritis  (v1) 
IIB Cases with severe intimal arteritis comprising >25% of the luminal area 
(v2) 
III Cases with ‘transmural’ arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and 
necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells with accompanying lymphocytic 
inflammation (v3)  
Chronic  active T-cell mediated  rejection  
‘Chronic allograft arteriopathy’ (arterial intimal fibrosis with mononuclear cell 
infiltration in fibrosis, formation of neo- intima)  
 
4. Interstitial fibrosis  and tubular  atrophy , no evidence of any specific  etiology 
(May include nonspecific vascular and glomerular sclerosis, but severity  
graded by [CONTACT_702870]).  
Grade  I  Mild  interstitial fibrosis  and tubular  atrophy  (<25%  or cortical  area)  
 
Grade II  Moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy 26- 50% of cortical 
area)  
Grade  III Severe interstitial fibrosis  and tubular  atrophy/  loss (>50%  of cortical 
area)  
5. Other -Changes not considered to be due to rejection- acute and/or chronic; 
may include isolated g, cg, or cv lesions and coincide with categories 2, 3, 4, 
and 5.  
Acute 
Rejection  Based on BANFF 2007/2013 Scoring Criteria.  Any epi[INVESTIGATOR_702745]/or ABMR.

Antibody 
Mediated 
Rejection  (ABMR) 
Based on BANFF 
2013 Criteria  Acute/Active  ABMR  (all three  features  must  be present  for diagnosis)1, 2 
1. Histologic  evidence of acute  tissue  injury,  including one or more  of the 
following:  
• Microvascular Inflammation  (g>03 and/or ptc>0)  
• Intimal  or transmural arteritis  (v>0)4 
• Acute thrombotic microangiopathy, in the absence of any other 
cause  
• Acute  tubular  injury,  in the absence  of any other  apparent 
cause  
2. Evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular 
endothelium,  including at least one of the following:  
 • Linear C4d staining in peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] (C4d2 or C4d3 by [CONTACT_702871], or C4d>0 by [CONTACT_527599])  
• At lease  moderate microvascular  inflammation  (Ig + ptc>2)5 
• Increased expression of gene transcripts in the biopsy tissue indicative of endothelial injury, if thoroughly validated
6 
3. Serologic  evidence of donor -specific  antibodies  (DSAs)  (HLA  or other 
antigens)  
 These lesions  may be clinically  acute,  smoldering or subclinical.  Biopsies 
showing two of the three features  except  those with DSA and C4d without 
histologic  abnormalities  potentially  related to ABMR  or TCMR (C4d  staining 
without evidence of rejection) may be designated as “suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]” for 
acute/active ABMR.  
 Chronic,  active  ABMR;  all three  features must  be present  for diagnosis1,7 
 1. Morphologic  evidence of chronic  tissue  injury,  including one or 
more of the following:  
 • Transplant  glomerulopathy  (TG)  (cg>0)8, if no evidence of 
chronic thrombotic microangiopathy  
• Severe peritubular  capi[INVESTIGATOR_702746]-layering 
(requires EM)9 
• Arterial  intimal fibrosis  of new onset,  excluding other  causes10 
2. Evidence  of current/recent  antibody  interaction  with vascular 
endothelium,  including at least one of the following:  
 • Linear C4d staining in peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] (C4d2 or C4d3 by [CONTACT_702871], or C4d>0 by [CONTACT_527599])  
• At least moderate microvascular  inflammation  ([g+ptc]> 2)5 
• Increased expression of gene transcripts in the biopsy tissue 
indicative of endothelial injury, if thoroughly validated6 
3.  Serologic  evidence of DSAs  (HLA or  other  antigens)  
 C4d staining without evidence of rejection; all three features must be 
present for diagnosis11

immunohistochemistry;  ptc, peritubular  capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396];  TCMR,  T cell–mediated rejection;  
v, Banff arteritis score.  
1. For all ABMR diagnoses, it should be specified in the report whether the lesion 
is C4d -positive (C4d2 or C4d3 by [CONTACT_527601]; C4d>0 by [CONTACT_702873]) or without evident C4d deposition (C4d0 or C4d1 by [CONTACT_702872]; C4d0 by [CONTACT_527599]).  
2. These lesions  may be clinically  acute,  smoldering or subclinical.  Biopsies 
showing two of the three features, except those with DSA and C4d without histologic  abnormalities  potentially  related to ABMR  or TCMR (C4d staining 
without evidence of rejection; see footnote 11, below) may be designated as 
‘‘suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]’’ for acut e/active ABMR.  
3. Recurrent/de novo glomerulonephritis  should be excluded.  
4. It should be noted that these arterial  lesions  may be indicative of ABMR,  TCMR 
or mixed 
ABMR/TCMR. ‘‘v’’ lesions  are only scored in arteries  having a 
continuous media with two or more smooth muscle layers.  
5. In the presence  of acute TCMR,  borderline  infiltrates  or evidence of infection, 
ptc >[ADDRESS_954157] be >1. 
6. At present the only validated molecular marker meeting this criterion is ENDAT 
expression (4), and this has only been validated in a single center (University of 
Alberta). The use of ENDAT expression at other centers or other test(s) of gene 
expression within the biopsy as evidence of ABMR must first undergo 
independent validation as was done for ENDAT expression by [CONTACT_702874] (4).  
7. Lesions  of chronic,  active  ABMR  can range from primarily  active  lesions  with 
early TG evident only by[CONTACT_46107](cg1a) to those with advanced TG and other 
chronic changes in addition to active microvascular inflammation. In the 
absence of evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with the 
endothelium  (those features  in the Second Section),  the term active  should be 
omitted; in such cases DSA may be present at the time of biopsy or at any 
previous time post -transplantation.

only if there is no history  of TCMR.  An elastic  stain may be helpful  as absence

they do not appear to be injurious to the graft (18,19) and may represent 
accommodation. However, with anti -HLA antibodies such lesions may  
progress  to chronic  ABMR  (20) and more  outcome data are needed.

 1. Study  Hypotheses/Objectives  
1.1. Hypotheses  
Ischemia followed by [CONTACT_702881] (I -R) of a kidney transplant results in up- regulated TNFa 
production within the allograft.  The I -R induced TNFa plays a crucial role in amplifying allograft 
inflammation  by [CONTACT_702882],  expansion and graft infiltration  of donor -reactive  T cells  
and B cells (the latter of which also produce donor -reactive antibodies), while simultaneously 
inhibiting  regulatory  T cell induction and function.  Together  with early  TNFa -mediated induction 
of a fibrogenic  molecular  profile  in the graft,  these early  post-transplant,  TNFa -dependent 
processes  h ave  prolonged,  detrimental,  pro-inflammatory  consequences  th at injure  the 
transplanted organ.  This hypothesis predicts that peritransplant TNFa blockade (initiated intra-  
operatively,  prior to graft reperfusion)  will have  a profound  effect  by [CONTACT_702883]- inflammatory and pro- fibrogenic responses, thereby [CONTACT_702884].  As a consequence, blocking TNFa at the time of transplantation will  
improve both short -term and long- term outcomes in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702754].  
1.2. Primary  Objective  
The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of adding intravenous infliximab

 2. Background and Scientific  Rationale 
2.1. Background  
Kidney  Graft  and Patient  Survival  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_702759]  (AR),  the widespread use of 
calcineurin inhibitors and accompanying immunosuppressive medication, including induction 
therapy,  has had only a modest  impact  on prolonging transplant  survival,  particularly  in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702760].  In fact, the average life span of kidney allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702761], with death with a functioning graft [50% due to c a rdiovascula r (CV) disease] as the 
most  common  cause  of gr aft  loss (1, 2). Multiple  factors  ar e implicated  in post-transplant  mortality 
but the influence of renal dysfunction on CV status is an important suspected etiology.  Chronic 
immune -mediated injury to the graft is common, and post -transplant kidney function is strongly 
associated with both the incidence and risk of CV death,  independent  of other  known risk factors 
(3). 
 
Current  standard  of care immunosuppression  for kidney  transplantation  
Standard of care immunosuppression for deceased donor kidney transplantation in most North 
American  centers,  consists  of induction therapy  with rabbit  anti-hu man  thymocyte  globulin  (rATG 
or Thymoglobulin®)  and triple  maintenance therapy  with tacrolimus,  either  mycophenolate 
mofetil or enteric -coated mycophenolate sodium, and corticosteroids (SRTR Annual Report 2010). 
rATG is a polyclonal antibody derived from immunization of rabbits with human thymocytes. The 
final product includes antibodies against CD2,  CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11A, CD18, CD25, CD44, CD45, 
HLA-DR, and HLA class I heavy chains, and is effective in preventing cellular immune responses 
against a variety of antigenic stimuli (4). In a randomized trial of 72 kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , 
rATG was superior to horse anti -thymocyte globulin resulting in lower rates of acute rejection (4% 
versus 25%)  and producing more sustained lymphopenia (5).  Two randomized trials  have 
compared the overall effectiveness of rATG to anti -interleukin 2 receptor antibodies in patients 
deemed to be “high risk” (6, 7). The inclusion criteria for these two studies differed, but are broadly encompassed by [CONTACT_702886]. In each study, ATG proved to be superior to anti - 
interleukin [ADDRESS_954165] of care for this high- risk population.  
 
In the above- described studies of ATG in high- risk kidney allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], DGF rates were less 
than 1%, raising  the possibility  th at polyclonal  antibodies  may prevent  DGF.  A randomized study 
of 58 deceased donor kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702762] 
(8). Interestingly, the incidence of DGF was lower for rATG -treated patients in the study by [CONTACT_702887] (7), although not in the larger  study  by [CONTACT_702888] (6).
 rATG  does  not completely  mitigate 
the development  of DGF  and its role in mollifying  IR injury  remains  unclea r,  supporting the need 
to test additional  agents.  Adhesion molecules,  cytokines,  chemokines  and their receptors 
contribute to IR injury  and their blockade by a polyclonal  antibody  may mitigate  the 
development of DGF. This  theoretical benefit of polyclonal agents forms the basis for their initial 
administration  intra-operatively,  prior to revascularization  of the allograft.  
Ischemia reperfusion  injury and kidney transplantation  
Increasing evidence implicates inflammatory events related to ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury 
occurring immediately  after transp lantation  of deceased donor  organs  as impacting  short - a nd 
long- term survival.  Delayed graft function, the forme fruste of post -transplant IR injury, resu lts in 
acute  renal  failure  manifested by [CONTACT_447]-transplantation oliguria  and requires  dialytic  support.  DGF  
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  31 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 is associated  with increased  allogr aft  immunogenicity,  elevated risk of acute  rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 
and decreased long- ter m survival (9, 10). The incidence of DGF averages 30% of all deceased 
donor kidney transplants (9, 10). The development of DGF post -transplant strongly correlates with 
poorer  kidney  graft survival  an d with the subsequent  development  of chronic  allogr aft 
nephropathy or IF/TA (11, 12). One study of 126 cadaveric kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702763] a 90% 5- ye ar gr aft survival,  
those with DGF for more than 9 days had a 5- year graft survival of 50% (11). A meta -analysis found 
that patients who experienced DGF had a higher risk of acute rejection [RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 – 
1.47), P < 0.001] and worse long- term renal function (13). In addition, DGF is associated with 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  higher  transplanta tion costs and adverse  effects  on the rehabilitation 
of transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (14). Prolonged ischemic  times  are associated  with increased  incidence 
of delayed kidney graft function (10, 15).  Longer cold ischemic storage times for kidney grafts are 
also associated with increased incidence of acute  rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_702764] (10, 16, 17).  Thus, DGF is both an outcome following kidney 
transplantation and a predictor  for long- term graft function.  
 
Mechanistic studies of IR injury and associated inflammation in animal models and humans 
(reviewed in (10))  indicate  that reperfusion of an ischemic  organ,  whether  or not it causes 
delayed graft function,  induces  an intense inflammatory  response in the tissue. This inflammation 
is initiated by [CONTACT_702889] (ROS) that activate the vascular 
endothelium of the tissue to express adhesion molecules, produce complement components (18 - 
21), and rele ase  a var iety  of pro-inflammatory  cytokines  (22, 23), including IL-1, IL-6, TNF a,  and pro- 
inflammatory chemokines and complement.  The released pro- inflammatory molecules and 
cytokines, including TNF a activate the vascular endothelium to mobilize selectins and von 
Willebr and factor to the luminal membrane and upregulate surface expression of integrin ligands. 
TNFa  also initiates  the activation  of interstitial  dendritic  cells and their emigration  from  tissue  sites 
of inflammation to the peripheral lymphoid organs draining t he inflammatory sites where they 
activate donor antigen- reactive T cells to become effector T cells.  Together, these processes 
provide an immunogenic,  pro-inflammatory  environment  th at facilitates  the induction an d 
function of adaptive  immune  responses  ultimately  resulting in graft failure.  
Animal  studies  performed by [CONTACT_702890]  (including 
studies of subjects with TNFR polymorphisms), among other early pro- inflammatory mediators (e.g. 
complement acti vation) can significantly attenuate tissue injury (24- 27). While each of these 
pathways contributes to inflammation, acute injury and graft dysfunction, it is possible to 
significantly dampen the effects by [CONTACT_702891].  These data show synergistic  
interactions of the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_702765]- inflammatory mechanisms, and highlight the concept that 
inhibiting one relevant mechanism can dampen the entire vicious cycle of inflammation and h ave  important  protective consequence.  The published  findings  strongly  imp licate  TNFa  as a key 
driver  of e arly  post-transplant  inflammation that contributes  to late allograft  injury  and loss.  T hu s, 
the overa rching  goal of the proposed  study  is to test the efficacy  of blocking  post-transplant  TNFa 
on early and late outcomes following deceased donor kidney transplantation.  
2.2. Rationale  for Selection  of Investigational Product  or Intervention  
Following the recognition that TNFa plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple TNFa blocking agents were developed and tested in humans (28).  In 2014, five TNF 
blocking agents are FDA approved for human use: infliximab, a mouse/human chimeric anti - TNFa 
mAb (administered IV, half -life of 8 -10d); adalimumab and golimumab, fully humanized a nti-TNF 
mAbs (administered SC, half -lives 7 -20 d); certolizumab, which is a PEGylated anti - TNFa Fab 
fragment  (administered SC half-life 14 d); and etanercept,  a TNFR2:Fc  fusion protein that binds  
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  32 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 TNFa and lymphotoxin family members (administ ered SC half -life 4 d). Approved indications for 
TNFa  blockade include treatment  of RA, Crohn’s  disease,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  and psoriasis.  
Accumulating data indicate strong safety profiles for each of these agents, but chronic TNFa 
blockade is associated  with increased risks  for infection including reactivation  of tuberculosis  (TB) 
and other  invasive  fungal  infections.  There  is controversial  evidence indicating  that chronic  TNFa  
blockade can inhibit  wound healing [current  recommendations  ar e that pa tients  on chronic  TNFa 
blockade stop the treatment  prior  to surgery  (28, 29)].  TNFa  blocking  agents  have been  tested  as 
chronic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_702766], and with some evidence of 
p ar ado xical  worsening  of he art  disease  (30).  These latter  results,  possibly  due to chronic  inhibition 
of anti -inflammation (protective) TNFR2 signaling have resulted in  a relative contraindication for 
chronic TNFa blockade in RA patients with heart failure.  Autoimmune hepa titis has been 
described as an uncommon complication of chronic TNFa blockade (see package insert).  
In our proposed studies we will restrict administra tion of anti - TNFa mAb to a single perioperative 
dose. We will use infliximab over other TNFa blockers because: a) it is FDA approved for use in 
humans (albeit not in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) and it is effective in RA and Crohn’s disease; b) it is the 
only a gent administered IV such that high levels can be achieved if given in the OR; c) its relatively 
short half -life (8 -10 days) so as to block TNFa during and after reperfusion injury for only up to 
several weeks post -transplant, thereby [CONTACT_702892] -tr ansplan t 
inflammation  without  significantly  increasing long term infectious  risk; and d) its cost is affordable.  
2.3. Preclinical  Experience  
Anti- TNFa mAb inhibits post -transplant inflammation and prolongs allograft survival in rodents. 
Experiments performed in mice by [CONTACT_702893] [Co- I, member of this consortium] 
demonstrated  that a single  dose  of anti- TNFa  mAb  at the time of allograft  reperfusion has multiple 
protective consequences (24).  It attenuates many components of  the early post -transpla nt 
inflammation including production of neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractants and the 
infiltration of these leukocyte populations as well as donor -reactive memory CD8 T cells into the 
allograft within the first [ADDRESS_954166] - transplant. These CD8 memory T cells reactive to donor class 
I MHC molecules produce IFNy within 24 hours of allograft reperfusion (24) and are important 
contributors to the establishment of an inflammatory milieu in the allograft that facilitates the 
infiltration  of effector  T cells  primed  in the spleen into the allogr aft.  Peri-transplant  administra tion 
of a single dose of anti -TNFa antibody also has a profound effect in inhibiting alloreactive CD4 
and CD8 T cell priming. Interstitial dendritic cell emigration from tissue inflammatory sites is 
promoted by [CONTACT_51004]α  (31, 32)suggesting this as a mechanism  accounting  for the decreased effector 
CD4  and CD8  T cell priming  in the anti-TNFa  treated  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  TNFa  upregulates  class  I/II MHC 
(31, 33) so that neutralization in allograft  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702767].  
Administration  of anti-TNFa  antibodies  with CyA,  anti-CD40L or anti-CD4 mAb prolonged heart 
and small  bowel  survival  in rodent  models  that was associated  with delayed T cell infiltration  into 
the allografts (33- 37). Brouard and colleagues extended these mechanistic findings to show that 
anti- TNFa  mAb  administered  to MHC  mismatched r at he art  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  at the time of 
the transplant: a) decreased graft inflammation and extended graft survival and b) strikingly prevented induction of anti-donor  MHC IgG antibodies  (38).
 The latter  occurred without 
detectable effects  on Th1 or Th2 cytokines suggesting  a specific  effect  on inhibiting  T cell help to 
B cells, a possible mechanism that warrants further testing.  TNF blockade with a TNFR:Fc fusion 
protein was tested  with and without  cyclosporine in a small  number  of cynomolgus  monkey 
kidney  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (39).   Acute  rejection was delayed from 5 to 11 days with TNF 
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  33 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 blockade alone and to ~35 days in animals treated with CYA plus TNF blockade (10 days in CYA 
alone treated animals).  No significant off target effects were noted in this short -term study. 
Together,  the preclinical  data support the conclusion that blocking TNFa  at the time of the 
transplant  h as profound effects  on immediate  post-transplant  inflammation,  and on subsequent  
T and B cell alloimmunity and graft outcome, supporting the need to test the effects of early TNFa 
blockade in human transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  as proposed herein.  
2.4. Clinical Studies  
Studies  of human  he ar t  transplant  biopsies  show ed eleva ted  TNFa  mRNA  and protein  expression 
early post -transplant and unrelated to rejection grade or serum levels (40) consistent with the 
concept  that TNFa  is produced  in the gr aft  as p art of the IR injury  response.  TNFa  blocking  agents 
h ave  been  tested,  to our knowledge,  in 2 reports  of human solid  organ  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Kirk 
and Mannon used chronic therapy with infliximab plus Campath 1H in an attempt to induce 
kidney transplant tolerance in a small number of patients (41). While the therapy was deemed 
safe, it was not efficacious in the protocol employed: all patients ultimately developed rejection. The Bogaev group used etanercept as chronic therapy to prevent ventricular hypertrophy in 49 
hea rt transpla nt recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (42), aga in demonstra t ing safety when administered with other 
immunosuppressants, and showing some efficacy in preventing ventricular hypertrophy. No 
wound healing problems were reported. Importantly, none of the studies have attempted to use 
TNFa blockade as solely an inductio n therapy to dampen inflammation and its downstream 
consequences,  as we propose  herein.  Etanercept  has also been  used  in association  as induction 
therapy (given on day 0, 3, 7 and 10), with and without concomitant ATG, in islet transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702768] (43- 45). 
Finally, the group from Berlin (Schnachtner et al, WTC [ADDRESS_954167]) recently reported their experience combining an anti -TNF antibody with a T cell-deple ting antibody in 40 kidney re - 
transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702769] “sensitized”  based  on the presence of donor -reactive  T cells  prior 
to transplantation. Compared to a control group of 40 “non- sensitized” re -transplant patients 
treated with conventional immunos uppression, the group treated with anti -TNF a ctually had 
significantly  better  5-year gr aft  survival  (p=0.02).  There were  no differences  in acute rejection  a nd, 
notably,  no differences  in septic complications  or in r ates  of CMV,  BK, or EBV viremia.  Together, 
the preclinical data, the established safety profile of the class of drugs in general and in small

 3. Study  Design 
3.1. Description  of Study  Design  
This is a phase  II, multicenter,  ra ndomized,  double blind,  and placebo- controlled,  2-arm study of 
300 deceased  donor  kidney  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702770]  1:1 to the experimental  and control 
ar ms  (150  patients  per arm).  Subjects  in the control  arm will be treated  with rATG  plus placebo 
(sterile normal saline) induction followed by [CONTACT_417927], a mycophenolic acid derivative (either 
MMF  or enteric  coated MPA),  an d corticosteroids.  Subjects  in the experimental  arm will receive 
infliximab  plus rATG  induction followed  by [CONTACT_417927],  a mycophenolic  acid derivative  (either  MMF 
or enteric coated MPA), and corticosteroids.  Please refer to the study therapy regimen below.  
 
Please refer to Section 8- Study Procedures for additional details regarding dosing and 
administration.  
 
Study  Therapy  Regimen  
 
 
Experimental 
Arm • Remicade®  (Infliximab)  
• Thymoglobulin®  (Anti-Thymocyte  Globulin  Rabbit)  
• Tacrolimus  (Prograf®) or one of the following:  
o Generic  equivalent  
o An equivalent  once- daily  formulation of Tacrolimus  
• Mycophenolate Mofetil/MMF or Mycophenolate Acid/MPA (or their generic 
equivalents  
• Methylprednisolone  or generic  equivalent  
 
 
Control 
Arm • Placebo  (Normal  Saline  for Injection)  
• Thymoglobulin®  (Anti-Thymocyte  Globulin  Rabbit)  
• Tacrolimus  (Prograf®) or one of the following:  
o Generic  equivalent  
o An equivalent  once- daily  formulation of Tacrolimus  
• Mycophenolate Mofetil/MMF or Mycophenolate Acid/MPA (or their generic 
equivalents)  
• Methylprednisolone  or generic  equivalent  
 
Estimated GFR (eGFR) will be  calculated using the MDRD formula based on serum creatinine 
performed centrally at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, GFR core laboratory, (Poggio PI). 
Pathology analyses of graft tissue will be performed at the Pathology core lab at University of M an it oba at Winnipeg (Gibson, PI).  Anti-HLA antibody testing will occur at the core HLA lab at 
the University of Manitoba  at Winnipeg  (Nickerson,  PI). Mechanistic studies  will be performed at 
2 a dditiona l  core laboratories  at the Clevela nd  Clinic,  Cleveland OH (Fairchild,  PI) and the Icahn 
School  of Medicine at Mount  Sinai,  NY, NY (Heeger,  PI). 
Medication  Adherence 
Non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications is known to be associated with inferior 
allograft outcomes.  Hence, short - and long- term a dherence to immunosuppressives will be 
monitored  during  the study.  During  the first [ADDRESS_954168]-transplantation,  prednisone  adherence 
will be monitored  using  a medication  event  monitoring  system  (MEMS®).  Subjects  will be asked 
to transfer their prednisone to a MEMS® bottle for the 3- month duration after transplant. Long - 
term tacrolimus adherence will be quantified using the standard deviation of the monthly tacrolimus  troughs  from [ADDRESS_954169]-transplantation.

Subjects will be randomized 1:1 through a computer program administered by [CONTACT_702894]  (infliximab)  or control  ( salin e)  ar m in a blinded fashion 
and using a standard randomization process.  Only the study pharmacist at each center will be 
unblinded.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_315828].  
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  38 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 Blinding  
This is a double- blinded study; therefore, medication assignments will be unknown to the study 
participants as well as to the site clinical personnel.  Only the site research pharmacist will have 
access  to the unblinded  randomization assignment  and schedule  for th at site. In the event  that 
the subject undergoes a life- threatening infusion reaction, then the study subject and the treating 
physician will be unblinded to treatment assignment.  Safety events that do not occur during an 
infusion of the study drug,  but that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_702773].  IND safety reports  
will be reported to the FDA, DSMB, and IRBs in an unblinded fashion.  
Unblinding  Author ization  
Emergency unblinding of a participant for safety purposes is to be handled through the site 
Investigators,  the NIAID  me dical  monitor,  and the site pha rmacist.  Whenever  possible  the NIAID 
medical monitor should be notified prior to and involved in the decision to unblind.  In all cases, 
including when the medical monitor is not notified prior to the decision to unblind, prompt 
notification  and reporting is required.  Except  in the case  of a life-threatening infusion  reaction,  a 
request to unblind a study subject should be based in the belief that knowledge of the treatment assignment is necessary in order to treat the patient appropriately.  In the case of a life - 
threatening infusion reaction every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_702895],  however  ultimately  the site Investigator  must  act in the study  
subject’s best 
interest.  
Reporting  Unblinding  Events  
Any unblinding event will require a full written report.  The report should include 1) a brief 
description of the medical events which led to the decision to unblind, 2) the name [CONTACT_702959], and 3) the justification for 
unblinding  the subject.  If the unblinding  occurred  in a situat ion other  than  the infusion  of the study 
drug, the report should indicate how knowledge of the treatment assignment was expected to influence therapeutic decisions. All unblinding information will be reported to the DSMB and will 
be included in the final study report to the FDA.  
During  site visits,  the site monitor  must  verify  that the DAIT  NIAID  medical  monitor  of the trial was 
notified and that a written  account  (described above)  was completed.

 4. Selection of Participants and Clinical Sites/Laboratories 
4.1. Rationale for Study  Population  
Our intention is to recruit patients at moderately high risk for DGF, acute rejection and, poorer 
long-term graft function and survival. This strategy is based on the notion that an effective 
intervention in a moderately high- risk population will is more likely to improve outcomes than in 
low risk patients.  On the other hand, limiting the study to very high- risk patients could hamper 
enrollment and reduce the generalizability of the study’s results. Study enrollment will be limited 
to male and female adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702774] -only transplants. The inclusion criteria are based on the Kidney Donor 
Profile  Index.  In this new allocation  scheme  KDPI  <[ADDRESS_954177] kidneys  which  we want  to 
avoid  for this study.  By [CONTACT_702896]  > 20, an d by [CONTACT_702897],  we expect  mean  
KDPI  [INVESTIGATOR_79796] 50-60 and aver age  CIT >20hrs.  Excluding KDPI  >[ADDRESS_954178]  (e.g. octogenarians)  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  a population  that differs  from 
the majority of transplants recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702775] a) higher infectious risks from over immunosuppression) and b) are least likely to benefit because of poor kidneys.  
 
 
 
4.2. Inclusion  Criteria  
Individuals  who meet  all of the following  criteria  are eligible  for enrollment  as study  participants:  
1. Adult  (>18 years  of age) male and female  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (all races  and ethnicities)  
2. Subject  must  be able to understand and provide consent  
3. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702732]  (including re-transplants)  
4. Negative  crossmatch,  actual  or virtual,  or a PRA of 0% on historic  and current  sera as

Donor  Profile  Indices  (KDPI)  ranging from >20 to <[ADDRESS_954179] result for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection ([COMPANY_003], 
QuantiFERON, ELISPOT). 
Subjects  who have  a negative test result  for latent  TB infection within  [ADDRESS_954180] will determine the next step.  
• If the  test is  negative, no  further action is  required 
• If the test is positive , lost, indeterminant  or unavailable the subject  must  be treated 
for latent  TB infection (if the subject  is enrolled,  received study  drug/placebo and 
transplanted).  
o Treatment  for latent  TB infection is required for all in this group.  
o The treatment regimen (including the specific drug, dose and duration of 
treatment) will be determined by [CONTACT_702898].  
• If the subject  has no latent  TB testing  available,  then the subject  cannot  be 
enrolled

4.4. Selection  of Clinical  Sites/Labs 
Patients will be enrolled at 15 sites within our consortium (US and Canada). Thirteen domestic US 
sites:  Barnes/Jewish  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Washington University  St Louis  Mo, University  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702778], Cleveland OH, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Atlanta GA, 
Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702779], NY, University of  [LOCATION_004] Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, University of 
[LOCATION_004]  San Francisco,  San Francisco,  CA, University  of Michigan  Med ical  Center,  Ann Arbor, 
MI, Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], New Haven, CT, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL , University 
of Wisconsin,  Madison,  WI, the University  of Maryland,  Baltimore,  MD and Johns  Hopkins  University, 
Baltimore, MD.  University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, in Manitoba, Canada and Toronto General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702780], Can ad a are the only international  sites particip ating  in this protocol. 
Additional  clinical sites may be recruited if enrollment  is lower  than anticipated.  
The core laboratories that will be used in the study are the following:  the Cleveland Clinic, 
Cleveland, OH, GFR core laboratory (Emilio Poggio, PI) will be the serum crea tinine core, 
pathology analyses of graft tissue will be performed at the Pathology core lab at University of Ma nitoba  at Winnipeg  ( Ian Gibson,  PI). Anti-HLA antibody  testing  will occur  at the core HLA lab 
at the University of Manitoba at Winnipeg (Peter Nickerson, PI).  Mechanistic studies will be 
performed at 2 additional core laboratories at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland OH (Robert 
Fairchild,  PI) and the Icahn  School  of Medicine at Mount  Sinai,  NY, NY (Peter  Heeger,  PI). 

CTOT -[ADDRESS_954182],  Remicade®  (Infliximab)  
According  to the package insert,  the most  common  side effects  of infliximab  (occurring  in > 10% 
of patients) are infections, infusion- related reactions, headache, and abdominal pain. In clinical 
trials,  infections  occurred  in 36%  of patients  receiving  infliximab  versus  25%  of pa tients  receiving 
placebo. The most common infections were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]. Rare but serious 
infections include reactivation of latent tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections, and reactivation 
of hepatitis  B. Approximately  18% of patients  experience infusion reactions,  including  fever  an d 
chills  (3%) an d either  chest  pain,  hypotension or hypertension (1%).  Rare anaphylactic  reactions 
h ave  been  reported.  Other  rare but serious  side effects  include  malignancy  (including  lymphoma 
and non -melanoma skin cancers), hepatotoxicity, worsening of pre- existing hea rt fa ilure, 
cytopenias,  demyelination  syndrome,  and a lupus  like syndrome  (approximately  20%  of patients 
develop new anti -dsDNA antibodies but symptoms of lupus are rare). Most of the side effects 
reported above occurred in patients receiving multiple doses of infliximab. Subjects will receive one dose of infliximab in this study.  The presence of active infection is a contraindication to 
administering the drug.  
Adverse  effects  during administration of Remicade®  (infliximab)  have  included flu-like symptoms, 
headache, dyspnea, hypotension, transient fever, chills, gastrointestinal symptoms, and skin rashes.  Anaphylaxis  might  occur  at an y time during  REMICADE®  infusion.  Approximately  20%  of 
REMICADE® -tr e ated  patients  in all clinical  trials  experienced an infusion  reaction compa red with 
10% of placebo- treated patients. Prior to infusion with REMICADE®, pre- medication will be 
administered  to participants.  Pre-medication will include antihistamines  (anti-H1 +/- anti-H2) and 
acetaminophen.  
During  infusion,  mild to moderate infusion  reactions  may improve following  slowing  or suspension 
of the infusion, and upon resolution of the reaction, reinitiating at a lower infusion rate and/or 
therapeutic administration of antihistamines, acetaminophen, and/or corticostero ids. For 
patients that do not tolerate the infusion following these interventions, REMICADE® should be discontinued.  
During  or following  infusion,  patients  who have  severe infusion- related hypersensitivity reactions 
should be discontinued from further REMICADE® treatment. The signs and symptoms of the reaction should dictate the management of severe infusion reactions.  
REMICADE® at doses >5 mg/kg should not be administered to participants with moderate to 
severe  hea rt  failure.  Participants  in this protocol  will receive one 3mg/kg  dose  of REMICADE®.  In 
a randomized study evaluating REMICADE® in patients with moderate to severe heart failure 
(New  York  Heart  Association  [NYHA]  Functional  Class  III/IV),  REMICADE®  treatment  at 10 mg/kg 
was associated  with an increased  incidence  of death  an d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702781] [see product labeling: Warnings and Precautions and Adverse Reactions].  
REMICADE® should not be re- administered to participants who have experienced a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction to REMICADE®. Additionally, REMICADE® should not be administered to 
participants with known hypersensitivity to inactive components of the product or to any murine 
proteins.

Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 Serious  Infections  
Patients  treated  with REMICADE®  are at increased  risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_702782].  
Opportunistic  infections  due to bacterial,  mycobacterial,  invasive  fungal,  viral,  or par asitic 
organisms including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, 
legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF -blockers. 
Patients  have  frequently  presented with disseminated rather  than localized  disease.  
Treatment  with REMICADE®  should not be initiated in pa tients  with an active  infection,  including 
clinically important loc alized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co - 
morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressive medications such as 
corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at greater risk of infection.  
The risks and benefi ts of treatment  should be considered prior to initiating  therapy  in patients:  
• With chronic  or recurrent  infection 
• Who have  been exposed to tuberculosis  
• With a history  of an opportunistic  infection 
• Who have  resided or traveled in areas  of endemic  tuberculosis  or endemic  mycoses,  such  as 
histoplasmosis,  coccidioidomycosis,  or blastomycosis 
• With underlying conditions  that may predispose them  to infection.  
Tuberculosis  
Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in 
patients receiving REMICADE®, including patients who have previously received treatment for 
late nt  or active  tuberculosis.  Patie nts  should be e valu ated  for tuberculosis  risk f actors  and tested 
for latent infection prior to initiating REMICADE® and periodically during therapy.  
 
Treatment  of latent  tuberculosis  infection prior to therapy  with TNF blocking  agents  has been 
shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Induration of [ADDRESS_954183] result when assessing if treatment 
for latent tuberculosis is needed prior to initiating REMICADE®, even for patients previously 
vaccinated  with Bacillus  Calmette -Guerin (BCG).  
Anti-tuberculosis  therapy  should  also be considered prior  to initiation  of REMICADE®  in patients 
with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk 
factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of 
tuberculosis  is recommended to aid in the decision  whether  initiating  anti-tuberculosis  therapy  is 
appropriate for an individual patient.  
Tuberculosis shoul d be strongly considered in patients who develop a new infection during 
REMICADE® treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to 
countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact [CONTACT_4490] a person 
with active tuberculosis.  
Monitoring  
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with REMICADE®, including the development of tuberculosis in 
patients who tested negative for latent t uberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for 
latent  tuberculosis  infection may also be falsely  negative while  on therapy  with REMICADE®.  
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  45 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 REMICADE®  should  be discontinued if a patient  develops  a serious  infection  or sepsis.  A patient 
who develops a new infection during treatment with REMICADE® should be closely monitored, 
undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised 
patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initia ted. 
 
Invasive Fungal  Infections  
For patients who reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, invasive fungal infection 
should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic illness. Appropriate empi[INVESTIGATOR_702783] a diagnostic  workup is being performed.  Antigen an d 
antibody  testing  for histoplasmosis  may be negative in some  patients  with active  infection.  
When feasible, the decision to administer empi[INVESTIGATOR_702784] a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive 
fungal infections and should take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the 
risks of antifungal therapy  
Malignancies  
Ma ligna ncies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults 
who received treatment with TNF -blocking agents (initiation of therapy > 18 years of age), 
including  REMICADE®.  Approximately  half of these  cases  were  lymphomas,  including  Hodgkin’s 
and non- Hodgkin’s  lymphoma.  The other  cases  represented  a var iety  of maligna ncies,  including 
rar e malignancies  th at are usually  associated  with immunosuppression  and malignancies  th at ar e  
not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 
30 months  (range  1 to 84 months)  after  the first dose of TNF  blocker  therapy.  Most  of the patients 
were receiving concomitant immunosuppressive medications. These cases were reported post - 
marketing and are derived f rom a variety of sources, including registries and spontaneous post - 
marketing reports.  
 
Lymphomas  
In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF -blocking agents, more cases of lymphoma 
have  been observed among  patients  receiving  a TNF blocker  compa red with control  patients.  In 
the controlled and open- label portions of REMICADE® clinical trials, 5 patients developed 
lymphomas among 5707 patients treated with REMICADE® (median duration of follow -up 1.0 
years) vs. 0 lymphomas in 1600 contr ol patients (median duration of follow -up 0.4 years). In 
rheumatoid arthritis patients, 2 lymphomas were observed for a rate of 0.08 cases per 10 patient - 
years  of follow- up, which  is approximately  three- fold higher  than expected in the general 
population.  In the combined clinical trial population for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, 
psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis, 5 lymphomas were observed for a rate of 0.10 cases per 100 patient -years of follow -up, which is approximately four - 
fold higher than expected in the general population. Patients with Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis  or plaque psoriasis,  p articularly  patients  with highly  active  disease  and/or  chronic 
exposure to immunosuppressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the 
general  population for the development  of lymphoma,  even in the absence of TNF-blocking 
therapy.  Cases  of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported with post-marketing TNF - 
blocker use in rheumatoid arthritis and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF blocker 
therapy, patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk (approximately 2- fold) than the 
general  population for the development  of leukemia.  
 
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma  (HSTCL)  
Post marketing cases of hepatosplenic T -cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T -cell lymphoma, 
have  been reported in patients  treated  with TNF blockers  including REMICADE®.  These cases have  
CTOT -[ADDRESS_954184] been fatal. All reported REMICADE® cases have 
occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent 
and young adult  male s.  All of these  patients  had received treatment  with the 
immunosuppressants  azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly  with REMICADE®  at or 
prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to REMICADE® or 
REMICADE® in combination with these other immunosuppressive medications. W hen treating 
patients with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in adolescents and young adults, 
consideration of whether to use REMICADE® alone or in combination with other  
immunosuppressive medications should take into account a possibility that ther e is a higher risk of 
HSTCL with combination therapy versus an observed increased risk of immunogenicity and 
hypersensitivity reactions with REMICADE® monotherapy from the clinical trial.  
 
Skin cancer  
Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported i n patients treated with TNF blocker 
therapy, including REMICADE® [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients,  particularly  those with risk factors  for skin cancer.  
Other  Malignancies  
 
In the controlled portions  of clinical trials  of some  TNF-blocking  agents  including REMICADE®,  more 
malignancies (excluding lymphoma and non- melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) have been 
observed in patients receiving those TNF-blockers compared with control patients. During the 
controlled  portions  of REMICADE®  trials  in patients  with moderately  to severely  active  rheumatoid 
arthritis, Crohn’s disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and plaque psoriasis, 14 patients were diagnosed with malignancies (excluding lymphoma and NMSC) 
among 4019 REMICADE® -treated patients vs. 1 among 1597 control patients (at a rate of 0.52/100 
patient -years among REMICADE® -treated patients vs. a rate of 0.11/100 patient -years among 
control patients), with median duration of follow -up 0.5 years for REMICADE® -treated patients 
and 0.[ADDRESS_954185], 
colorectal, and melanoma. The rate of malignancies among REMICADE® -treated patients was 
similar to that expected in the general population whereas the rate in control patients was lower than expected.  
 
In a clinical trial exploring the use of REMICADE® in patients with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pul monary disease (COPD), more malignancies, the majority of lung or head and 
neck origin, were reported in REMICADE® -treated patients compared with control patients. All 
patients had a history of heavy smoking [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Prescribers shoul d exercise 
caution when considering the use of REMICADE®  in patients  with moderate to severe  COPD.  
 
Psoriasis patients should be monitored for non- melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), particularly those 
patients who have had prior prolonged phototherapy treatment. In the maintenance portion of 
clinical trials for REMICADE®, NMSCs were more common in patients with previous phototherapy. 
The potential  role of TNF-blocking therapy  in the development  of malig nancies  is not known  [see 
Adverse  Reactions  (6.1)].  Rates  in clinical trials  for REMICADE®  cannot  be compa red to rates  in 
clinical trials of other TNF -blockers and may not predict rates observed in a broader patient 
population.  Ca ution should  be exercised  in considering  REMICADE®  treatment  in patients  with a 
history of malignancy or in continuing treatment in patients who develop malignancy while receiving REMICADE®.

Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 Hepatitis  B Virus  Reactivation  
Use of TNF blockers,  including  REMICADE®,  has been associated  with reactiva tion  of hepatitis  B 
virus  (HBV)  in pa tients  who are chronic  carriers  of this virus.  In some  instances,  HBV reactivation 
occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports 
have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune 
system,  which  may also contribute  to HBV reactivation.  Patients  should  be tested  for HBV infection 
before initiating TNF blocker therapy, including REMICADE®. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of 
hepatitis B is recomme nded. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of  
treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti -viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker 
therapy  to prevent  HBV r e activation .  Patients  who are ca rriers  of HBV and require  trea tment  with 
TNF blockers  should be closely  monitored for clinical  an d laboratory  signs of active  HBV  infection 
throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who 
develop  HBV  reactivation,  TNF  blockers  should  be stopped  and antiviral  thera py  with appropriate 
supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV 
reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when 
considering resumption  of TNF blocker  therapy  in this situation  and monitor  patients  closely.  
 
Hepatotoxicity  
Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis and cholestasis, have 
been reported rarely in post -marketing data in patients receiving RE MICADE®. Autoimmune 
hepatitis has been diagnosed in some of these cases.  Severe hepa tic reactions occurred 
between 2 weeks to more than 1 year after initiation of REMICADE®; elevations in hepatic 
aminotransferase levels  were  not noted prior  to discovery  of the liver injury  in many  of these  cases. 
Some of these cases were fatal or necessitated liver transplantation. Patients with symptoms or 
signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or 
marked liver enzyme  elevations  (e.g., ≥ 5 times  the upper  limit of normal)  develop,  REMICADE® 
should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the abnormality should be undertaken. In clinical trials, mild or moderate elevations of ALT and AST have been obser ved in patients 
receiving REMICADE®  without  progression to severe  hepatic  injury.  
 
Patients  with Heart  Failure  
REMICADE® has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure, and should 
be used in patients with heart failure only after consideration of other treatment options. The 
results of a randomized study evaluating the use of REMICADE® in patients with heart failure 
(NYHA Functional Class III/IV) suggested higher mortality in patients who received 10 mg/kg 
REMICADE®, and higher rates of cardiovascular adverse events at doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg. There have been post -marketing reports of  worsening heart failure, with and without 
identifiable  precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505]  f actors,  in patients  taking  REMICADE®.  There have  also been  r are post - 
marketing  reports  of new onset  heart  failure,  including  heart  failur e  in patients  without  known pre- 
existing cardi ovascular disease. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age. If a 
decision is made to administer  REMICADE®  to patients  with hea rt  f ailure ,  they should  be closely 
monitored during therapy, and REMICADE® should be discontinued if new or worsening symptoms of heart failure appear.  
 
Hematologic  Reactions  
Cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, some with a fatal 
outcome, have been reported in patients receiving REMICADE®. The causal relationship to 
REMICADE®  therapy  remains  unclear.  Although no high- risk group(s)  has been identified,  caution 
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  48 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 
should be exercised  in patients  being  tr e ated  with REMICADE®  who have  ongoing  or a history  of 
significant hematologic abnormalities. All patients should be advised to seek immediate medical 
attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., 
persistent fever) while on REMICADE®. Discontinuation of REMICADE® therapy should be 
considered in patients  who develop significant hematologic abnormalities.  
 
Hypersensitivity  
REMICADE®  has been  associated with hypersensitivity  reactions  that var y in their  time of onset 
and required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_606247]. Most hypersensitivity reactions, which include urticaria, dyspnea, and/or hypotension, have occurred during or within 2 hours of REMICADE® 
infusion.  However,  in some  cases,  serum  sickness -like reactions  have  been  observed  in patients 
after  initial REMICADE®  therapy  (i.e., as e ar ly  as after  the second  dose),  an d when  REMICADE® 
therapy  was reinstituted following  an extended period without  REMICADE®  treatment. Symptoms 
associated with these reactions include fever, rash, headache, sore throat, myalgias, polyarthralgias,  hand  and f acial  edema  and/or  dysphagia.  These  reactions  were  associated  with 
a marked increase in antibodies to infliximab, loss of detectable serum concentrations of 
infliximab, and possible loss of drug efficacy.  
 
REMICADE® should be discontinued for severe hypersensitivity reactio ns. Medications for the 
treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., acetaminophen, antihistamines, corticosteroids 
and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction.  
In rheumatoid  arthritis,  Crohn’s  disease  and psoriasis clinical  trials,  re-administration  of REMICADE® 
after a period of no treatment  resulted in a higher  incidence of infusion  reactions  relative  to 
regular maintenance treatment. In general, the benefit -risk of re -administration of REMICADE®
 
after a period of no- treatment, especially as a re- induction regimen given at weeks 0, 2 and 6,  
should be carefully considered. In the case where REMICADE® maintenance therapy for psoriasis  
is interrupted,  REMICADE®  should be reinitiated as a single dose followed  by [CONTACT_702899].  
 
Neurologic  Reactions  
REMICADE® and other agents that inhibit TNF have been associated in rare cases with CNS manifestation of systemic  vasculitis,  seizure  and new onset  or exacerbation of clinical  symptoms 
and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disorders, including 
multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including Guillain - 
Barre syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of REMICADE® in 
patients with these neurologic disorders and should consider discontinuation of REMICADE® if these disorders develop.  
5.2. Risks of Investigational  Product  or Intervention  cited  in Medical  Literature  
Use of infliximab  has been associated  with impaired wound healing.  There are also rare reports  of 
autoimmune hepatitis.  
5.3. Risks of Other  Protocol  Specified  Medications 
Risks of Thymoglobulin 
Thymoglobulin is indicated for the treatment  of renal  transplant  acute  rejection in conjunction 
with concomitant  immunosuppression.  
CTOT -[ADDRESS_954186]  of anaphylaxis  or severe cytokine  release syndrome (CRS).  F atal  anaphylaxis  has been 
reported. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, the infusion should be terminated immediately. 
Medical  personnel  should be available  to tr e at  pa tients  who experience  anaphylaxis.  Emergency 
treatment such as 0.3 mL to 0.5 mL aqueous epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000 diluti on) subcutaneously and 
other  resuscitative  measures  including  oxygen,  intravenous  fluids,  antihistamines,  corticosteroids, 
vasoactive amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated, should be provided. Any further administration of Thymoglobulin to a patient who has a history of anaphylaxis to 
Thymoglobulin is not recommended.  
Severe,  acute  infusion- associated  reactions  (IARs)  are consistent  with CRS,  which  is attributed  to 
the release of cytokines  by [CONTACT_702900].  Severe  acute  CRS  can cause 
serious cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_565167]/or death.  
Infection  
Thymoglobulin  is routinely  used  in combination with other  immunosuppressive agents.  Infections 
(bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), reactivation of infection (pa rticularly cytomega lovirus 
[CMV]) and sepsis have been reported after Thymoglobulin administration in combination with 
multiple immunosuppressive agents. Severe acute infections can be fatal.  
 
Hematologic  Effects  
Thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia (including lymphopenia and neutropenia) have been 
identified and are reversible following dose adjustments.  
 
Malignancy  
Use of immunosuppressive agents,  including Thymoglobulin,  may increase  the incidence of 
malign an cies,  including lymphoma or post-transplant  lymphoproliferative disease  (PTLD).  
Risks of Maintenance Immunosuppression  Medications  
Administration of all immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_702785], including lymphoma (~1%), and skin cancers. These agents are not recommended for nursing mothers, and it is recommended (and manda ted in the current protocol) tha t women 
of childbearing potential (WOCBP) use effecti ve contraception before, during and for at least [ADDRESS_954187] included 
sodium retention- related weight gain and fluid accumulation, hyperglycemia and glucose 
intolerance, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal upset and ulceration, reversible depression of the 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis, and mood changes ranging from mild euphoria and 
insomnia to nervousness, restlessness, mania, catatonia, depression, delusions, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Long- term use of prednisone may be associated with hypertension, 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], weight gain with Cushingoid features, osteopenia, and skin changes including acne and easy bruisability.  
Risks of Mycophenolic Acid Derivative (either Mycophenolate Mofetil/MMF or 
Enteric -coated Mycophenolic Acid/MPA)  
Mycophenolate mofetil  (MMF) and enteric -coated mycophenolate sodium  are approved (in 
combination with cyclosporine  and corticosteroids)  as immunosuppressive agents  for renal,  

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  50 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 cardiac,  and hepatic  solid organ transplantation.  Adverse  events  reported in > 30% of renal, 
cardiac or liver transplant patients receiving MMF were pain, fever, headache, asthenia, anemia, 
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, urinary tract infection, hypertension, hypotension, 
peripheral  edema,  hypercholesterolemia,  hypokalemia,  hyperglycemia,  increased  crea tinine  
and BUN,  cough,  hypomagnesaemi a, diarrhe a,  constipation,  n ause a,  vomiting,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977], dyspnea, lung disorder, pleural effusion, tremor and insomnia. The side effect profile of 
enteric -coated mycophenolate sodium  is similar  to those of MMF.  
 
There is an increased risk of dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_153201], particularly of the 
skin. Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving MMF 
1 - 1.5 mg BID. Severe  neutropenia developed  in up to 2% of renal  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702786]  1.5 mg BID. MMF  can cause fetal h ar m  (including  spontaneous  abortion in the first trimester 
and can cause congenital malformations in the offspring of women who are treated during pregnancy) when administered to a pregnant woman. Cases of pro gressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal and pure red cell aplasia have been reported in patients treated with MMF. Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) has been 
observed in approximately 3% of renal, in 1.7% of cardi ac, and in 5.4% of hepatic transplant 
patients treated with MMF 1.5 g BID. Additional information about MMF can be found in the 
package insert.  
Risks of Tacrolimus  
Side  effects  of tacrolimus  include  hypertension,  glucose  intolerance,  peripheral  neuropathy,  renal 
insufficiency, abnormal liver function studies, seizures, nausea, vomiting, confusion, 
hypomagnesa emia,  tremulousness,  neurotoxicity,  posterior  reversible  encepha lopathy  syndrome 
(PRES), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), i nterstitial lung disease, BK 
nephropathy, and increased risk of secondary malignancies. Additional information about 
tacrolimus can be found in the package insert . 
Risk of Prophylactic  INH Therapy  for Latent  TB Infection  
Subjects with a positive test for Latent TB Infection should receive prophylactic therapy.  
Hepatotoxicity has been seen in 10- 20% of patients that receive INH therapy.  Liver function tests 
should be monitored to determine the need for reduction or cessation  of the prescribed dose.  
Allergic  reactions  such  as skin rash can occur  but are uncommon.  Alcohol  should be avoided 
during treatment with INH.  
5.4. Risks  of Study  Procedures  
Risks of Blood  Draw  (Venipuncture)  
The amount  of blood th at may be drawn  from  adult  subjects  for research  purposes  will not exceed 
10.5mL/kg  or 550 mL; whichever  is smaller,  over  an eight -week  period.  All blood samples  for the 
mechanistic study  will be obtained at the time of scheduled  blood draws,  so there will be minimal 
additional risk associated with obtaining the study samples.  
The subject may experience some discomfort at the site of the needle entry, bruising, swelling, 
redness, fainting, or local infection. The additional amount of blood could contribute to the 
development of anemia . The subject’s clinical condition will be taken into consideration to 
determine if research blood tests can be performed 

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  51 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 Risk  of Protocol -Directed  Biopsy  
A renal transplant  biopsy  will be  performed for this  protocol according to the following  schedule:  
 
 
Protocol -Directed  Biopsies  
1.  Pre-implantation  biopsy  Day of Transplant/Visit [ADDRESS_954188]-transplant/  Visit  [ADDRESS_954189]-transplant/ Visit  14 
 
 
There is a risk of bleeding associated with percutaneous transplant kidney biopsies.  Transient 
hematuria occurs in 3 to 10% of patients and may prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], require bladder 
catheterization for clot drainage, or in approximately 1% of patients, require blood transfusion. 
Ureteral obstruction from blood clot may require percutaneous nephrostomy in < 1% of patients. 
Massive  hemorrhage requiring surgical  exploration,  transplant  nephrectomy,  or arterial 
embolization occurs in ~0.1 % of patients.  Death from massive  hemorrhage is rare.  
5.5. Potential  Benefits  
This study  may show  th at infliximab,  in combination  with rATG,  results  in a decreased  incidence 
and severity of ischemia reperfusion injury and delayed graft function, a decreased incidence of acute rejection, higher glomerular filtration rates, and increased graft survival rate compared to 
patients receiving placebo. The mechanistic studies may delineate the immune mechanisms 
underlying these potentially beneficial effects of infliximab, but will als o add to a more general 
understanding  of biomarkers  and their  role in predicting  outcomes  in kidney  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
The results  of this study  could  influence  future care of transplant  patients. Participants  in this study 
may benefit from the close follow -up dictated by [CONTACT_4690].

Remicade®  (Infliximab)  Indications  and Usage  
Remicade® (infliximab) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated for treatment of Crohn’s 
Disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, ankylosing 
spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis.  Use of Remicade® (infliximab) in the setting of 
solid organ tr ansp lantation  as a TNF blocker  has not been established,  and thus is not approved 
by [CONTACT_702902].  
Remicade®  (Infliximab)  Formulation,  Packaging,  Labeling  and Storage  
Infliximab, the active ingredient in REMICADE®, is a chimeric IgG1 κ monoclonal antibody 
(composed of human constant and murine variable regions) specific for human tumor necrosis 
factor -alpha (TNF α). It has a molecular weight of approximately 149.1 kilodaltons. Infliximab is 
produced by a rec ombinant cell line cultured by [CONTACT_702903] a series 
of steps that includes measures to inactivate and remove viruses.  
Remicade® is supplied as a 100mg vial (100mg lyophilized infliximab in a 20mL vial for injection). 
Remicade® is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion. Following 
reconstitution with 10 mL of Sterile  Water  for Injection,  USP, and  the resulting pH is approximately  
7.2. Each  single -use vial contains  100 mg infliximab,  500 mg sucrose,  0.5 mg polysorbate 80, 2.2

mg monobasic sodium phosphate, monohydrate, and 6.1 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, 
dihydrate. No preservatives are present.  
Each Remicade® 20mL vial is individually packaged in a carton.  Remicade® is supplied in an 
accumulator carton containing 10 vials.  Each single dose vial contains 100mg of infliximab for 
final concentration volume of 10mL.  
Remicade® will be purchased using funds from the Investigator grant (U01- AI063594) and 
distributed by [CONTACT_702904]  (Frederick,  MD).  
Storage  and Stability  
REMICADE®  must  be refrigerated at 2° C to 8° C (36° F to 46° F). Do not use REMICADE®  beyond 
the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] (Exp)  located on the carton  and the vial. This product  contains  no 
preservative.  
Dosage, Preparation and Administration 
Dosage and Administration  
Remicade® (infliximab)/placebo will be given as a single 3mg/kg intravenous pre- perfusion dose, 
beginning after initiation  of the corticosteroid infusion.  Actual  body  weight  will be used to 
calculate  the dose.  Remicade®/placebo  must  be given  through  a dedicated  intravenous  line. Do 
not infuse  Remicade® concomitantly  with another  IV solution or IV medication.  
• If the subject does not experience an adverse event during the first 30 minutes of the 
infusion, then Thymoglobulin® infusion will be initiated through a separate line from the 
Remicade® infusion.  
• The Remicade®/placebo infusion should be administered over a period of greater than 2 
hours and may continue beyond reperfusion (unclampi[INVESTIGATOR_702787]).  
• Whenever possible, Remicade®/Placebo and rabbit ATG should be administered through  
two separate IV lines.  
• If only a single IV line with a single port is available , the rabbit ATG infusion should begin 
only after the Remicade®/Placebo infusion has stopped and only after the line has been 
flushed with saline.  
• If the only  available venous  access  is a multiport  central  venous  catheter , rabbit  ATG can  
be started 30 minutes after initiation of Remicade®/Placebo through a separate port, but  
only if that catheter  has multiple  exit ports . 
Pre-medications may attenuate infusion -related events.  See the list of pre- medications in the 
table below. Please refer to the Investigational Pharmacy Manual for additional 
Remicade®/Placebo dosage, preparation, administration and storage details.  
Participants will receive a standard  of care dose  of corticosteroids prior  to transplantation.

1. Calculate the dos e, total volume of reconstituted REMICADE® solution required and the 
number of REMICADE® vials needed. Each REMICADE® vial contains 100 mg of the 
infliximab antibody.  
2. Reconstitute  each  REMICADE®  vial with 10 mL of Sterile  Water  for Injection,  USP,  using  a 
syringe equipped with a 21- gauge or smaller needle as follows: Remove the flip- top from 
the vial and wipe the top with an alcohol swab. Insert the syringe needle into the vial through  the center  of the rubber  stopper  and direct  the stream  of Sterile  Water  for Injection, 
USP,  to the glass  wall of the vial. Gently  swirl the solution  by [CONTACT_702906]. Avoid prolonged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 
minutes.  The solution should  be colorless  to light yellow and opa lescent,  an d the solution 
may develop a few translucent particles, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if the lyophilized  cake  has not fully dissolved  or if opa que particles,  discoloration,  or other  foreign 
particles are present.  
3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted REMICADE® solution dose to 250 mL with sterile 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, by [CONTACT_261858] a volume equal to the v olume of 
reconstituted REMICADE® from the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, 250 mL bottle or 
bag. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted REMICADE® solution to the 250 mL 
infusion bottle  or bag. Gently  mix. The resulting infusion concentration should  range 
between 0.4 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL. NS. In order to maintain the blinding of the study 
treatment, amber bag/bottle covers will be used to administer both infliximab and 
placebo.  See the pharmacy  manual  for additional  details.  
4. The REMICADE® infusion should begin within [ADDRESS_954190] use an 
infusion set with an in-line, sterile,  non- pyrogenic,  low-protein- binding  filter (pore  size of 1.2 
µm or less). The vials do not contain antibacterial preservatives. Therefore, any unused 
portion of the infusion solution should not be stored for  reuse.  
5. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co-  
administration of REMICADE® with other agents. REMICADE® should not be infused 
concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.  
6. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for particulate matter and discoloration pri or to administration, whenever solution and 
container permit. If visibly opaque particles, discoloration or other foreign particulates are observed, the solution should not be used.  
Contraindications  
REMICADE®  at doses  >5 mg/kg  should not be administered to patients  with moderate to severe 
he art  failure.  In a randomized study evaluating  REMICADE®  in patients  with moderate to severe 
heart  failure  ([LOCATION_001]  He art  Association  [NYHA]  Functional  Class  III/IV), REMICADE®  treatment  at 
10 mg/kg was associated with an increased incidence of death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702788] [Refer to the product labeling].  

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  55 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 
REMICADE® should not be re -administered to patients who have experienced a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction to REMICADE®. Additionally, REMICADE® should not be administered to 
patients with known hypersensitivity to inactive components of the product or to any murine 
proteins.  
Drug Interactions 
Use with Anakinra or Abatacept  
An increased risk of serious  infections  was seen  in clinical  studies  of other  TNF α-blocking  agents 
used in combination with anakinra or abatacept, with no added clinical benefit. Beca use of the 
na ture of the adverse reactions seen with these combinations with TNF -blocker thera py, similar 
toxicities  may also result  from the combination  of anakinra or abatacept  with other  TNF α-blocking 
agents. Therefore, the combination of R EMICADE® and anakinra or abatacept is not 
recommended [Refer to the product labeling].  
 
Use with Tocilizumab  
The use of tocilizumab in combination with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists, including 
REMICADE®, should be avoided because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and 
increased risk of infection.  
Use with Other  Biological Therapeutics  
The combination of REMICADE® with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as REMICADE® is not recommended [Refer to t he product labeling].  
 
Methotrexate  (MTX) and Other  Concomitant  Medications  
Specific drug interaction studies, including interactions with MTX, have not been conducted. The 
majority of patients in rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn’s disease clinical studies re ceived one or more 
concomitant  medications.  In rheumatoid arthritis,  concomitant  medications  besides  MTX  were 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), folic acid, corticosteroids and/or narcotics. 
Concomitant  Crohn’s disease  medications  were  antibiotics,  antivirals,  corticosteroids,  6-MP/AZA 
and aminosalicylates. In psoriatic arthritis clinical trials, concomitant medications included MTX in 
approximately half of the patients as well as NSAIDs, folic acid and corticosteroids. Concomitant 
MTX  use may decrease  the incidence of anti-infliximab  antibody  production and increase 
infliximab concentrations.  
 
Immunosuppressive  Medications  
Patients with Crohn’s disease who received immunosuppressive medication tended  to 
experience fewer infusion reactions compared to patients who were not.  [Refer to the product 
labeling].  Serum infliximab concentrations appeared to be unaffected by [CONTACT_702907]’s disease including corticosteroids, antibiotics 
(metronidazole or ciprofloxacin) and aminosalicylates.  
 
Cytochrome  P450 Substrates  
The formation of CYP450 enzymes  may be suppressed by [CONTACT_702908] (e.g., TNF α, 
IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN)  during  chronic  inflammation.  Therefore,  it is expected  th at for a molecule 
th at antagonizes  cytokine  activity,  such  as infliximab,  the formation  of CYP450  enzymes  could  be 
normalized. Upon initiation or discontinuation of REMICADE® in patients being treated with 
CYP450 subst rates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or 
drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose 
of the drug product may be adjusted as needed.  
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  56 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 Live Vaccines/ Therapeutic  Infectious Agents  
It is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with REMICADE® [Refer to the 
product labeling].  It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given 
concurrently  with REMICADE®.  
Special  Populations  Use 
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Category B - It is not known whether REMICADE® can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. REMICADE® should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Because infliximab does not cross -react with 
TNF α in species other than humans and chimpanzees, animal reproduction studies have not been 
conducted with REMICADE®.  No evidence of maternal  toxicity,  embryotoxicity or teratogenicity 
was observed in a developmental  toxicity  study  conducted  in mice  using  an analogous  antibody 
that selectively inhibits the functional activity of mouse TNF α. Doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg in 
pharmacodynamic animal models with the anti -TNF analogous antibody produced maximal 
pharmacologic  effec tiveness.  Doses  up to 40 mg/kg  were  shown  to produce no adverse  effects 
in animal reproduction studies.  
As with other  IgG antibodies,  REMICADE®  crosses  the placenta an d has been  detected  up to 6 
months in the serum of infants born to female pa tients treated with REMICADE® during 
pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk of infection, and caution is 
advised in the administration of live vaccines to these infants [Refer to the product labeling]  
Nursing  Mothers  
It is not known whether REMICADE® is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. Because many drugs and immunoglobulins are excreted in human milk, and because 
of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from REMICADE®, women shoul d not 
breast -feed their infants while taking REMICADE®. A decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to 
the mother.  
Infusion  Supervision  
Remicade® will be administered in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702789].  The intravenous infusion will be supervised by [CONTACT_49885] (i.e., clinical nurse, 
physician)  at the pa rticipa ting  institutions.  A history  of each  infusion  and any adverse  side effects 
will be recorded an d reported to the Clinical Research  Organization (CRO)  using  the appropriate 
case report forms.  
Vital signs (temperature,  blood  pressure,  pulse,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  r ate)  will be obtained prior  to the 
start of each  Remicade®  infusion  and every  [ADDRESS_954191]  1 hour  to enable 
the administration  of drugs,  if necessary.  Additional  vital signs  may then  be obtained  as clinically 
indicated.  
6.2. Investigational  Agent:  Placebo  
Placebo is considered an investigational agent in this study.  The placebo is 0.9% sterile normal 
saline for injection (0.9% NS).  
US sites will use only sterile normal saline that is produced by [CONTACT_702909] a National  Drug Code (NDC)  number  on product  labeling.

Dose,  Preparation,  Administration  and Storage 
Dosage and Administration  
Placebo will be given as a single intravenous pre- perfusion dose, volume matched (250ml) to 
Remicade®, administered in the operating room.  The infusion should be administered over a 
period of 2 hours or longer. Do not infuse placebo concomitantly with another IV solution or IV 
medication.  Placebo should be given through a dedicated line . Placebo can be administered 
at the same time as Thymoglobulin as long as placebo is given in a separate, dedicated intravenous line.  Pre-medications may attenuate infusion- related events.  See Pre -Medication s 
table  below.  Ple ase  refer  to the Investigational  Ph ar macy  M anu al  for additional

cover  will be used  to administer  both  infliximab  and placebo.  See the pharmacy  manual  for 
additional details. Placebo will be prepared and stored using the standard procedures at each 
institution’s Investigational Pharmacy.  Placebo should be prepared using appropriate aseptic 
techniques.  
Infusion  Supervision  
Remicade® and Placebo will be administered in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702791].  The intravenous  infusion  will be supervised  by [CONTACT_49885] (i.e., clinical nurse, 
physician)  at the pa rticipating institutions.  A history  of each  infusion  and any adverse  side effects 
will be recorded an d reported to the Clinical Research  Organization (CRO)  using  the appropriate 
case report forms.  
Vital signs (temperature,  blood  pressure,  pulse,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  r ate)  will be obtained prior  to the 
start of each Placebo infusion and every [ADDRESS_954194] 1 hour to enable 

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  58 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 the administration  of drugs,  if necessary.  Additional  vital signs  may then  be obtained  as clinically 
indicated.  
6.3. Drug  Accountability  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) and Canadian regulations 
(C.05.012)  the investigator  will maintain  adequate  records  of the disposition  of the investigational 
agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed 
(participant -by-participa nt a ccounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or 
deliberately destroyed.  
The study site will maintain  records  for receipt,  storage,  use, and disposition.  A drug- dispensing 
log will be kept current for each participant.  This log will contain the identi fication of each 
participant and the date and quantity of drug dispensed.  
All records  regarding  the disposition  of the investiga tiona l  product  will be available  for inspection. 
Any partially used, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], or product remaining at the end of the study may be destroyed 
according to the center’s standard operating center.  If a center does not have an SOP for drug 
destruction,  then the product  will be returned to the CTOT  drug distribution center  for destruction.  
6.4. Toxicity  Prevention  and Management  
During  infusion,  mild to moderate infusion  reactions  may improve following  slowing  or suspension 
of the infusion, and upon resolution of the reaction, reinitiating at a lower infusion rate and/or 
therapeutic administration of antihistamines, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids.  For 
participants that do not tolerate the investigational agent following these interventions, the 
infusion should be discontinued.  
6.5. Premature  Discontinuation  of Investigational  Agent  
Study therapy may be prematurely disc ontinued for any participant if the participant has severe 
infusion- related hypersensitivity or an infusion related reaction. During or following infusion, 
participants who have severe infusion- rela ted hypersensitivity reactions should be discontinued 
from further investigational agent administration. The management of severe infusion reactions 
should be dictated by [CONTACT_119951].  
Study therapy may also be prematurely discontinued for any participant if the investigator 
believes that the study treatment is no longer in the best interest of the participant, if the subject 
is judged non- compliant, or due to other safety concerns.  Participants that prematurely 
discontinue the study therapy regimen will remain in the study until study cl osure.

 8. Study  Procedures 
8.1. Screening/Enrollment  
The research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. As part 
of the informed  consent  process  outlined  in CFR  Title [ADDRESS_954200] will determine 
the next step.  
• If the test is negative,  no further  action  is required 
• If the test is positive, lost, indeterminant or unavailable the subject must  be tr eated for 
latent TB infection (if the subject is enrolled, received study drug/placebo and 
transplanted).  Treatment is required for all in this group.  
o The treatment  regimen (including the dose and duration  of treatment)  will be 
determined by [CONTACT_702913].  
■ Rif ampin -based prophylaxis is discouraged due to a drug- drug 
interaction with tacrolimus and other drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_48931] P450 system.  
• If the subject has no evidence of latent TB testing available, then the subject cannot 
be enrolled.  
8.2. Baseline  Visit  
Subjects will have their baseline visit prior to transplant.  During this visit blood, urine and tissue will 
be collected from participants.

Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 Randomization  
Randomization will occur after enrollment, prior to transplant surgery. Participants will be 
randomized to either the Treatment group (receive Remicade®) or the Control Group (receive 
placebo).  The site personnel  will enter  the information in the web-based  system.  This action will  
generate an automatic emai l and/or faxed communication to the site staff indicating successful 
randomization.  
 
This is a blinded  study  so participants  and the study  team  will not know  the trea tment  a ssignment 
of the participant.  Only the research pharmacist will receive a communication identifying the 
treatment assignment.  Randomization treatment assignments will be generated by [CONTACT_702914]. The SACCC will maintain a central web- based 
randomization system.

have been subsequently validated by [CONTACT_702924] (56- 59). Completion of ELISPOT assays requires ~[ADDRESS_954221] for alloreactive T cell memory (analogous to the panel of reactive antibody, PRA , 
screening test for humoral  immunity),  we developed and validated  the “panel  of reactive  T cells,” 
or PRT, assay (60 -62). In the PRT, PBMC from transplant candidates (e.g. dialysis patients on the 
transplant waiting list) are tested in IFNy ELISPOT assays  against a panel of HLA disparate B cell 
stimulator lines.  Our goals here are to a) prospectively validate the pre- transplant PRT as an 
independent risk assessment tool in deceased donor transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] b) to compare the 
results of the PRT to ant i-donor responses as predictors of outcomes in study population. Using 
serially collected post -transplant blood samples we will assess the impact of anti -TNFa induction 
therapy  on the strength  of the post-transplant  anti-donor  T cell immune  responses  over time. 
Based on new data published by [CONTACT_702925]28neg effector T cells are important 
mediators of allograft injury and that this population of cells only produce IFNy in ELISPOT assays if 
stimulated  with IL-15 (63) we will perform  side by [CONTACT_702926]-donor  ELISPOT  assays with an d 
without recombinant IL- 15 compare the results and determine how well the results of each assay 
correlate with outcomes.  Readouts will be both IFNy and Granzyme B ELISPOTs.  
We will obtain blood samples in heparinized green top tubes pre- transplant (pre- induction) and 
serially post -transplant and will perform PRT and anti -donor ELISPOT assays with and without IL- 15 
as published.  In vitro expanded B cell lines will be used as stimulator cells  for these assays. HLA 
typed B cells will be expanded from donor and or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702807].  PRT  
assays will be done with the same panel of up to 8 stimulator lines for each patient at each time 
point.  As it is anticipated that donor tis sue will only be obtainable from a subset of the deceased 
donors in this study, anti -donor immunity will only be assessed in a subset of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (anticipated 
to be ~30% of the total enrollees).  
In exploratory studies, we will use 1- 2 million PBMCs obtai ned from these cells or from the cells 
obtained in 9.3 below to evaluate expression >[ADDRESS_954222] recently demonstrated that biologically -relevant donor -reactive T cell clones can be 
identified by [CONTACT_5019]- throughput sequencing of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] T cells proliferating in an anti -donor MLR 
and expanded compared to unstimulated T cell populations100. In pa tients achieving tolerance 
by [CONTACT_702927], the number of circulating donor - 
reactive CD4 T cell clones declined over time, whereas conventional transplant patients  
showed an increase  in these clones  in the circulation.  We hypothesize,  therefore,  that a decline 
in these donor -specific CD4 clones at one year compared to pre- transplant blood may identify 
patients who are operationally “tolerant” and whose graft outcomes at two years will be excellent. We hypothesize that there may be more frequent reductions in these clones in the 
infliximab -treated group than the controls, though this hypothesis cannot be addressed until the 
study  is completed,  due to the double- blind  study  design.  We also hypothesize that a high level 
of expansion of donor -specific Tconv and lack of expansion of donor -specific Tregs will be 
associated with the presence of rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Conversely, high levels of expansion of 
donor -specific  Tregs  and/or  conversion of donor -reactive  CD4 Tconv  to Tregs  post-transplant 
may be associated with the absence of rejection. We have been able to detect CFSE -low CD4

 cells in the anti-donor  MLR  that appear  in the sorted Treg fraction  of transplant  patients  (Figs. 
1,2) as well as donor -reactive  T cells that appear  in the sorted Tconv  fraction  pre-transplant  and 
in the Treg fraction post -transplant (Fig.2).  Thus, donor -specific Tregs may be identified and 
tracked with this method.  
 
Furthermore, in pi[INVESTIGATOR_702808] -specific TCR DNA in 
urine of kidney  transplant  patients  prior 
to and during rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_702809]. We hypothesize that the presence of 
donor -reactive TCR DNA in the urine 
may be a diagnostic marker and/or 
predictor of rejection. We propose a 
substudy to obtain preliminary data 
relevant to these hypotheses in 10 
subjects.  This work  will be performed 
at Columbia  University  (Megan Sykes, 
MD).  
 
1) The degree of expansion or reduction of donor -reactive CD4 TCRs in the circulating T cell 
pool at 6 and/or  12 months  correlates  with graft outcomes  at 2 years.  
2) Expansion of donor -specific  Tregs  or conversion of donor -reactive  Tconv  to Tregs  post- 
transplant correlates with excellent graft function and absence of rejection.  
The presence of donor -reactive  TCR DNA in the urine predicts  and/or  correlates  with the 
presence of rejection.  
T Regulatory  Cells Substudy  
The flow cytometric analyses will determine the effect of anti -TNFa induction on Treg frequencies. 
To assess impact of anti -TNFa on Treg function, in a subset of patients in each group (n=10 per 
group without anemia) we will isolate 50- 100 cc of blood to perform functional analyses of Treg 
suppressive capacity to  verify the correlations between phenotype and function. We will flow sort 
CD4+CD25hiCD127lo T cells and test them in in vitro suppression assays (64), using effector T cells 
from normal controls as the responders.  We will quantify DNA methylation of the F oxp3 gene (65) 
and phosphorylation (66) using commercial assays in selected samples as an indirect measure of 
Foxp3 stability of the Treg.  Only participants from the Cleveland Clinic, University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702810]/Case  Western,  and Mount  Sinai  will be included in this Substudy.  
Urinary  Chemokine  Protein  and Necroptosis Markers  
Urinary chemokine assays will be performed at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New 
York, NY (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Peter Heeger, MD).  
One goal of these studies is to determine the ef fectiveness of the anti -TNFa mAb in attenuating 
TNFa -mediated inflammation and its associated downstream sequelae. Urinary chemokines, 
including CXCL9, CXCL10 are elevated immediately post -transplant as a reflection of ischemia 
reperfusion injury.  We hypot hesize that anti -TNFa induction therapy will limit post -tr ansplan t 
inflammation and ischemia reperfusion injury.  To test this we will serially collect urine samples over 
the first month post-transplant  and test supernatants  for CXCL9  and CXCL10  (among other

 potential markers), perform time dependent analyses and compare the results between the 
experimental and the control groups.  
A second goal of these studies is to validate the utility of urinary CXCL9 as a biomarker for ongoing or incipi[INVESTIGATOR_702811] a high- risk study population.  We previously showed that in low risk 
kidney  allogr aft  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702812]9measurements  are an accur ate  noninvasive approach 
to diagnosing acute cellular (but not humoral rejection) and can detect subclinical allograft injury 
(with a stable creatinine) that will develop over time into clinically evident rejection (67).  Our goal 
herein is to determine the utility of serial urinary CXCL9 measurements to: a) diagnose and or predict incipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], clinically evident, biopsy proven acute rejection, b) to assess whether the type (cellular  and or antibody)  and/or  grade of rejection impacts  diagnostic/predictive utility,  and c)
 
to define causes of false positive results (predicted to be infection and resolv ing IR injury).  Urine 
samples will be obtained from each patient at each site at predefined time points between transplantation and [ADDRESS_954223] 6 months.  We will also obtain  urine samples  at the time of a biopsy  performed  for evalu atio n 
of acute kidney dysfunction.  
Urine  supernatants  will be sent to a core lab and frozen in aliquots.  Samples  will be tested  by [CONTACT_702928]9, CXCL10 and additional markers.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] d ata indicate that values >  200 mg/dl 
represents a positive test indicative of ongoing or incipi[INVESTIGATOR_702813].  Results will be correlated 
with clinical evidence of rejection (we will not direct therapy based on the results of the assays). 
As we have  previously  shown  that urin ar y  infections  including  BK virus  infections  le ad to increases 
in urinary CXCL9, we will correlate the urinary CXCL9 results with tests for BK and UTI.

We will isolate RNA  from  PBLs  and perform  RT-PCR  (or nanostring).  There is some  evidence  that

mRNA  Profiling,  Gene  Expression  Profiles  in Tissue  
We also hypothesize that chronic allograft injury manifested pathologically as progressive 
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) is initiated early post -transplant by a pro - 
inflammatory environment, compounded by T cell and antibody mediated injury. Our hypothesis 
is that anti -TNFa induction will dampen  early post -transplant inflammation and prevent or 
attenuate induction of a fibrogenic gene profile in the allograft that ultimately leads to chronic 
allograft  injury.  This hypothesis  predicts  th at differences  in molecular  signatures  indicating  fibrosis 
are likely  to be present  prior  to the histological  development  of the injury  and th at they will be less 
prevalent  (and  or occur  later)  in pa tients  treated  with an ti-TNFa  induction.  Data in animal  models 
of liver and renal  fibrosis  and clinical studies  clearly  implicate  a role for TNFa  an d for TNF receptor 
1 signaling  in the instigation  of this fibrogenesis  (154- 159).  We will test this hypothesis  by [CONTACT_702929] g 
gene expression profiles in urine between the treatment and control arms, and comparing the 
results  to the pathological  an alysis  of IF/TA progression  between implantation and 24 mo. (as well 
as with eGFR  which  is likely  to correlate with the IF/TA progression).

a) Effects  of anti-TNFa  induction  on intragraft  inflammation.  To supplement  the urinary  gene

tissue,  we will make RNA  from a portion of the 3-month  protocol  biopsy  from  each pa tient 
and perform qPCR (or nanostring) to quantify gene expression of inflammatory and 
profibrotic gene s (same as those described in section 8.1.4).  For each gene, we will 
compa re  the results  between the experimental  and control  groups  and will also determine 
the strength of the correlations between urinary gene expression patterns and intragraft 
gene expression patterns.  
b) In unpublished work from co- I B Murphy, analysis of RNA obtained prospectively from [ADDRESS_954224]  subsequent  12 mo. chronic  injury, 
independent of clinical and histopathological parameters.  This genomic biomarker of 20 
differentially  regulated genes  (some up-regulated,  others  down- regulated)  strongly 
correlate with chronic allograft damage at 1 year, but importantly not with fibrosis at 3 mo. Statistical analysis of this preliminary panel reveals an average AUC score of multiple 
iterations of ROC curves  of 0.947 within 95% confidence interval 0.942- 0.952. Our goal here 
is to independently  valid ate  and refine the gene set as a biomarker for incipi[INVESTIGATOR_702815]. 
We will prospectively test the predictive value of the gene set expressed in the 3- month 
biopsy RNA using the new cohort from this deceased donor kidney transplant trial and will 
test the impact of anti -TNFa therapy on the utility of the biomarker. We will isolate RNA from 
surveillance/protocol biopsies obtained at 3 mos. from our study cohort  (control and anti - 
TNFa treatment arms).  We will perform qRT -PCR on each RNA sample to detect expression 
levels of the minimal gene set (10- 20 genes) as a biomarker.  We will test the strength of the 
relationship of this intragraft gene expression profile biomarker with: a) 12m eGFR, b) 24m eGFR  and c) cha nge  in histology  scores  between implantation and 24 months  accounting 
for confounders (see statistical analysis below).

mRNA  Profiling,  Gene  Expression  Profiles  in Urine  Pellet  
To further determine the effectiveness of the anti -TNFa mAb in attenuating TNFa -mediated 
inflammation and its associated downstream sequelae, we will study and compare urinary RNA 
expression of a panel  of selected molecules  relevant  to IR injury  and are known to be up- 
regulated by [CONTACT_98418] ( Table 7).  
Table  7. Genes to be studied in Graft tissue  and urine  
We will examine and compare: urinary cellular RNA 
expression profiles and urinary proteins peri - 
transplant, in the control and treatment ar ms.  For 
cost containment purposes, we will use quantitative 
real time PCR (qPCR) or nanostring technology as the 
primary methodology.  Urine samples from each 
patient obtained at the predefined time points (Schedule  of Events,  Appendix  1) will be pelleted  and 
the cellular sediment homogenized in RNA Lysis 
Solution.  We will not differentiate  or separate immune 
cells  from  intrinsic  renal  cells  in this process. RNA  will 
be isolated from biopsy samples or urine cells and 
reversed transcribed using random hexam ers in our 
published and validate d  SOPs.  qPCR  will be done as 
published (68) using primers for the mouse BAK gene to establish a standard curve and normalized 
to 18S.  The expression  levels  of e ach  gene  will be expressed  as copy  number  per µg of the control  
BAK standard.  Additional inflammatory and fibrosis genes will be assessed by [CONTACT_702930] (exploratory analyses).  
We will compa re  the results  between treatment  groups  and all laboratory  results  will be correlated 
with graft outcomes, specifically endpoints related to early graft function (DGF, immediate graft 
function, slow graft function, see Endpoints in Sections 3.2 and 3.3), testing the hypothesis that 
dampening ischemia IR -inflammation impro ves outcome (e.g. prevents DGF).  
We will isolate urine cell RNA obtained serially post -transplantation to measure RNA for genes 
encoding proteins involved in the progression of interstitial graft fibrosis including TGFb, n - 
cadherin,  a-smooth  muscle  actin,  connective  tissue  growth  f actor,  vimentin,  fibronectin,  collagen 
I, collagen III, MMP -2, BMP7 (among others) in urine cells using qPCR as described above and

 Histology  
Our hypothesis is that the  anti-TNFa induction therapy will lower the incidence of acute T cell and 
antibody  mediated rejection and result  in improved 2-year gr aft  histology  (lower  chronicity 
scores).  
Graft  tissue will be obtained pre- tran splant  (prior  to implantation),  at [ADDRESS_954227] -tran splant.  Histologic examination will be done at the University of Manitoba at 
Winnipeg site. Biopsy results will be reported using the Banff ’07 schema for acute rejection and 
chronic allogr aft injury.  The centers will send renal tissue (1- 1.5 wedge or core tissue s in a pre - 
filled formalin jar).  If tissue cannot be sent to the Histology Core Lab, then the site should send or 
stained slides (3 PAS, 1 Trichrome or unstained and 1 H&E).  
Morpho logical evaluations will be recorded in a standardized format, according to Banff ’07 
criteria.  Primary data will be sent to the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center for final 
analysis.  High -resolution  images  of entire  sections  of all stains  from each biopsy  will be archived  in 
an Aperio Digital database system.  Slide images will be stored at the University of Manitoba at 
Winnipeg (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ian Gibson)  for additional  analysis,  if needed.  
TNFR1  Expression  Patterns  in Renal  Allografts  
We will test the hypothesis that the efficacy of anti -TNF therapy will depend upon the state of the 
kidney at the time of transplantation. Specifically, the prediction is that transplanted kidneys 
expressing high levels of TNFR1 but low levels of TNFR2 and DR3 have les s pre -existing injury and 
are less likely to manifest DGR. Some patients still develop DGF and this is the group of patients 
who would benefit from anti TNF therapy. In contrast, those transplanted kidneys expressing low levels of TNFR1 but high levels of DR3 and TNFR2 (i.e., those with ischemia -reperfusion injury) are 
more likely to develop DGF and less likely to show benefits of anti -TNF therapy. We plan to assess 
the expression patterns of TNFR1, TNFR2 and DR3 by [CONTACT_702931]-implantation FFPE biopsies and correlate the findings with clinical variables.  A portion of renal 
allo graft  tissue  collected at implantation will be shared with Yale School  of Medicine (Jordan 
Prober, MD).  
Immunofluorescence/IHC  
Peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] (PTC) loss induced by [CONTACT_702932] (75), in native kidneys with progressive 
dysfunction (76) and in kidney transplants (77). PTC loss as quantif ied by [CONTACT_702933]31 and CD34, has been reported to increase between baseline and [ADDRESS_954228]-transplant  more  often in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702818]  (more  so in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702819] s after cardiac  death)  th an in living  donor  kidneys, 
in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702820], and in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702821] (77). Furthermore, 
PTC loss occurs more commonly in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702822], in whom serum levels of the 
soluble VEGF -R1 levels are elevated (78).  As we hypothesize that these processes will be 
dampened by [CONTACT_702934] -TNFa, our working model predicts that PTC loss will be prevented 
in patients  in the treatment  group.
 We will compa re the change in PTC density  of biopsy  tissue 
by [CONTACT_702935] [ADDRESS_954229]  developed DGF  (or SGF)  or h ave  had good function as controls.  As 
PTC loss correlates  with subsequent  fibrosis  (77),  we will determine  whether  PTC density  at 3 months 
correlates with the prevalence and/or intensity of interstitial fibrosis at 2 years. Tissue obtained for 
Histology  (described above)  will be shared to complete the Immunofluorescence/IHC work.  If 
tissue is not received from the local center, they will send the core pathology 3 unstained slides mounted on positively -charged glass slides (e.g. Superfrost Plus treated slides), [ADDRESS_954230].  
Primary data will be sent to the CTOT Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center for final analysis. 
High-resolution images of ent ire sections of all stains from each biopsy will be archived in an Aperio 
Digital d atab ase  system.   Slide  images  will be stored at the University  of Manitoba  at Winnipeg 
(PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ian Gibson) for additional analysis, if needed.  
9.6. Humoral  Core  Lab 
The Humoral core lab is located at the University of Manitoba at Winnipeg, (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Peter 
Nickerson).  
Anti-HLA Antibodies  and Donor  Specific  Antibodies  
Preexisting  and de novo post-transplant  donor  specific  antibodies  (DSA)  can be pathogenic  and 
contribut e to acute and chronic  allograft  injury.  We hypothesize that blocking  early  inflammatory 
events post -transpla nt with a nti -TNFa induction therapy will prevent de novo alloantibody 
formation in human transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Serum  samples  will be collected from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_702823],  divided into aliquots 
and store at -[ADDRESS_954231] transplantation, as well as at the time of indication biopsies. W e will use 
standardized methods (79) to define kinetics, specificities and quantity (median fluorescence intensity, MFI) of DSA in each patient.  The HLA specificity, class I vs. II, and approximate titer of 
the anti -HLA IgG will be determined using Luminex  single HLA class I and class II antigen 
microbeads  in combination  with phycoerythrin (PE) secondary antibody  conjugates  for the 
detection of human IgG.  To minimize any prozone effect (interfering factors which mask the 
antibody strength (MFI) serum samples will be treated with or without EDTA as part of the evaluation to assess if there is an MFI increment with EDTA treatment. The Luminex beads will be 
analyzed using the LABScan™ [ADDRESS_954232] in the 
assignment  of the reaction strength (MFI).  We will compa re  the incidence of de novo DSA 
between the control and experimental arms and assess the correlations de novo DSA and 
outcomes.  
We will also collect  serum  samples  in the e arly  post-transplant  time period  (days  1-5) and measure 
TNFa  levels by  [CONTACT_702936] -TNFa  mAb  induction 
therapy limits post -transplant inflammation.  
9.7. Glomerular  Filtration  Rate  (GFR)  Core  Lab 
All creatinine values will be performed at the core lab at the Cleveland Clinic foundation (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Emilio Poggio, MD) for standardization.  
GFR analysis will be calculated by [CONTACT_345276][INVESTIGATOR_702824]  (CKD -EPI).  This method  uses  a serum  sample  for creatinine  at month  [ADDRESS_954233] -randomization.  To accomplish this in a uniform manner, serum samples 
will be collected as part of the protocol at these time points and creatinine values will be 
determined at a single site (CCF). Demographic character istics, gender, and race are required 
for calculation.  

CTOT -[ADDRESS_954234] at risk 
for late graft dysfunction. This evaluation will be based primarily on examining the Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves generated for each candidate biomarker and the 
associated classif ication accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity (as well as positive and 
negative predictive value). We will also explore combining the candidate biomarkers to determine  whether  there  ar e distinct  combinations  of biomarkers  th at may improve perfor mance 
relative  to individual  biomarkers.  The ROC curve  puts different  biomarkers  on a common  relevant 
scale and shows the entire range of possible performance. The information in these curves, 
describing the overall potential performance of each biomarker,  will be quantified by [CONTACT_941] a rea 
under  the curve  (AUC -ROC)  an d its associated  95%  confidence  interval  using  the nonparametric 
method  of Ha nley  an d McNeil  (80).  Cut points,  based  on optimizing  sensitivity  and specificity,  will 
be determined, and based on the ROC curves. The sensitivity and specificity so obtained (and also the positive and negative predictive values) will serve as the primary summaries of the predictive ability of each biomarker.  
Logic regression (81 -83) will be used to construct Boolean c ombinations of biomarkers, 
dichotomized into indicator variables using the optimized cut points referred to above.  Logic 
regression is an adaptive regression methodology that attempts to construct predictors as 
Boolean combinations  of bin ary  covariates.  This method  determines  a classification  algorithm  that 
identifies  predictive rules  for combining  biomarkers  by [CONTACT_702937]. The optimal rule is one that minimizes  a specified objective function; in this case, 
misclassification  of progression.  Cross -validation  will be used  to select  the optimal  number  of trees  
and leaves,  an d the resulting  score  used to construct  an ROC  curve.  The AUC  for this curve  will 
be computed  with the associated confidence interval determined using a bootstrap percentile 
method.  This “combination”  AUC -ROC  will be qualitatively  compa red  to those  obtained from the 
individual biomarkers.  Multiple logistic regression models will qu antify the association of the 
biomarkers to risk, and assess the potential confounding effects of key characteristics such as age, 
sex, race, treatments and comorbidities.  
Our hypothesis  that anti-TNFa  limits  activation of donor  reactive  immunity  and preve nts initiation 
and progression of graft fibrosis by [CONTACT_702938] a series  of linear  mixed  models.  Models  will be fit sequentially,  with specific  models  f it 
to address specific elements of the hy pothesized mechanism. Initially we will use regression 
models to quantify the extent to which infliximab, when added to therapy with ATG, reduces 
“early” inflammation at the time of transplantation, measured both by [CONTACT_702939] -implantation biopsies. Corresponding linear regression models will assess 
differences between treatment groups with respect to inflammation measures at 24 mos., and 
mixed  linear  models  will be used  to assess  the inflammation  measures  over the entire  time course 
subsequent  to the “early”  evaluation.  Additionally,  proportional  odds  models  will be used  to assess 
treatment differences in ordinal grade of graft fibrosis at 24 mos. and, through a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach, over time.  A fin ding of reduced inflammation with 
combination therapy would be consistent with our mechanistic hypothesis. Further confirmation would be a finding that the estimated benefit for added infliximab therapy at 24 hours and times 
subsequent the “early” assessment were diminished after adjusting for the “early” measures of 
inflammation. The adjusted estimate will be based on models that include the “early” measures 
as covariates  in the assessment  of treatment  on 24 hour  measures  and on the entire  time course. 
A formal statistical analysis plan is being prepared separately

 Sample Size: Our sample size will allow precise estimation of sensitivity and specificity, especially 
for those biomarkers  th at perform  well. For sensitivities  and specif icities  in the range  of 0.80 to 0.90, 
this sample size (300 subjects) ensures that the associated standard error is in the range of 0.02 to 
0.03.

 10. Biospecimen Storage 
Biological specimens (whole blood, plasma, serum, urine supernatant, urine pellet) obtained 
under  this protocol  may be used  in future  assays  to reevaluate  biological  responses  as additional 
researc h tests  are developed  over  time.  These  specimens  will be collected  at time points  already 
scheduled for the core mechanistic studies, in order to allow specimens to be stored for use in new assays that have yet to be optimized or conceived, or assays performed by [CONTACT_702940]- validation  studies.  Appropriate informed consent  will be obtained 
for both the collection and storing of samples.  The specimens from these eva lua tions may be 
stored beyond the funding period. During the funding period, samples will be identifiable, which 
means  samples  will be coded  with a subject  ID number  th at could  be directly  linked  to the subject 
and the 
subject’s medical record. When the funding period is over, samples will be anonymized, 
which means a sample that was previously identifiable, has had all identifiers removed and can no longer be linked back to the subject or the 
subject’s medical record by [CONTACT_61076] .

to the sponsor, DAIT/NIAID. Appropriate notifications will also be made to site principal 
investigators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Institutional Ethics Committees (IECs) and health 
authorities.  
Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data  Management: 
Definitions  and Standards  for Expedited  Reporting,  ICH Guideline  E-6: Guideline  for Good  Clinical 
Practice , 21CFR  Parts  312 and 320, and Division  5 of the Canadian Food and Drug  Regulations 
applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0: (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.htm l).
 
12.2.  Definitions  
Adverse Event  (AE) 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation in 
the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research 
(modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on 
Har mo nization  E -6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice) (from OHRP "Guidance on Reviewing 
and Reporting  Unanticipated  Problems  Involving  Risks  to Subjects  or Others  and Adverse  Events 
(1/15/07)" http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  ). 
Suspected  Adverse Reaction  (SAR)  
Any adverse event  for which  there is a reasona ble possibility  that the investigational  drug  caused 
the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is 
evidence to suggest  a causal  relationship between the drug and the adverse  event.  A suspected 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which  means  any adverse  event  caused  by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)/ICHE2A).  
Suspected  adverse  reactions  associated  with the study  therapy  regimen  or study  procedures  ar e  
collected  and reported to the sponsor.  The sponsor  will relay  any suspected  adverse  reactions  to 
the DSMB, as appropriate.  
Unexpected  Adverse Event  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the package insert or is not listed at t he specificity, severity or rate of occurrence that has been 
observed;  or is not consistent  with the risk information  described  in the general  investigational  plan 
or elsewhere in the IND.  
“Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned 
in the package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
p articu lar  drug under  investiga tion [(21 CFR  312.32(a) ] Division  5 of the Canadian  Food and Drug 
Regulations and ICH E2A}  

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  84 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 
For events assessed in association with kidney biopsy, an AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the protocol or i s not listed at the specificity, severity 
or rate of occurrence that has been observed.  
Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
An adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  re action  is considered “serious”  if, in the view  of either 
the investigator  or Sponsor  DAIT/NIAID,  it results  in any of the following  outcomes  (21 CFR  312.32(a), 
Division 5 of the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations and ICH E2A):  
1. Death.  
2. A life-threatening  event:  An AE or SAR  is considered “life-threatening”  if, in the view  of either 
the investiga tor  or Sponsor  [add  DAIT/NIAID  or other  Sponsor,  if applicable],  its occurrence 
places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death.  It does  not include  an AE or SAR  that, h ad it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909].  
4. Persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal 
life functions.  
5. Congenital  anomaly  or birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Elective  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702832].  
12.3.  Grading  and Attribution  of Adverse Events 
Grading Criteria  
The study  site will grade the severity of adverse  events  experienced by [CONTACT_702941] l  Cancer  Institute’s  Common  Terminology  Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE). This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) 
provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and  
to articulate  the clinical significance  of all adverse  events.  The NCI-CTCAE  has been  reviewed by 
[CONTACT_36476]( s), Principal Investigator, etc. and has been deemed appropriate for the 
subject population to be studied in this protocol.  
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the 
NCI-CTCAE manual:  
Table  13. NCI-CTCAE  Adverse Event  Grading  Scale 
 
Grade  1 Mild Adverse  Event  
Grade  2 Moderate  Adverse  Event  
Grade  3 Severe  and Undesirable  Adverse  Event  
Grade  4 Life-Threatening  or Disabling  Adverse  Event  
Grade  5 Death  
For this trial, only events that are ≥ 3 will be recorded as adverse events.  Additionally, all events 
that meet serious criteria will be recorded as AEs/SAEs, regardless of severity grade.  

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  85 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 For grading an abnormal value or result of a clinical  or laboratory evaluation (including, but not 
limited to, a radiograph, an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram etc.), a treatment -emergent 
adverse  event  is defined  as an increase  in grade  from baseline  or from the last post-baseline  value 
that doesn’t meet gr ading criteria. Changes in grade from screening to baseline will also be 
recorded as adverse events, but are not treatment -emergent. If a specific event or result from a 
given clinical or laboratory evaluation is not included in the NCI -CTCAE manual, then an 
abnormal result would be considered an adverse event if changes in therapy or monitoring are 
implemented as a result of the event/result. 
Attribution  Definitions  
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study therapy regimen or  study 
procedure(s) will initially be determined by [CONTACT_702942] (AE/SAE eCRF).  Final determination of attribution for safety 
reporting will be determined by [CONTACT_73884]/NIAID.  The relationship  of an adverse  event  to study therapy 
regimen or procedures will be determined using the descriptors and definitions provided 12.2.

12.4.  Collection  and Recording  of Adverse Events 
Collection Period  
Adverse events will be collected from the initiation of the investigational treatment until one of 
the following time points:  a subject completes study participation or 45 days after he/she 
prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study.  
After  Month  24/Visit  14 
After Month 24/Visit 14 sites will only report grade 3 or higher AEs and any SAE regardless of 
severity that occur within 24 hours after a protocol mandated procedure of blood draw.  
 
Collecting  Adverse Events  
Adverse  events  (including SAEs)  may be discover ed through any of these methods:  
• Observing the subject  
• Interviewing the subject  [e.g., using a checklist,  structured questioning,  diary,  etc.] 
• Receiving  an unsolicited complaint  from the subject  
In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate 
an adverse event, as defined in Section 12.3, Grading and Attribution of  Adverse Events.

described previously (Section 12.2, Definitions) on the appropriate AE/SAE eCRF regardless of the 
relationship to study therapy regimen or study procedure.  
• COVID -19 infections  of any grade  
 
 
Certain adverse events occur commonly in this study population and will not be recorded as an 
adverse  event,  unless  it meets  the definition of a serious  adverse  event.  
• Upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416],  nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, diarrhea, constipation, nausea,

• An elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702833] - 
mandated procedures is not to be reported as an SAE unless the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_702834].  
Once recorded, an 
AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the 
end of study participation, or until [ADDRESS_954240] prematurely withdraws  (without 
withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first.  
12.5.  Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events  and Adverse Events 
Reporting of Serious  Adverse Events to Sponsor  
This section  describes  the responsibilities  of the site investigator  to report  serious  adverse  events  to 
the sponsor  via the SACCC  eCRF.  Timely  reporting of adverse  events  is required by 21 CFR,  Division 
5 of the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations and ICH E6 guidelines.  
Site investigators will report all serious adverse  events (see  Section 12.2.3, Serious Adverse Event) , 
regardless of relationship or expectedness  within 24 hours of discovering the event . 
For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE eCRF will be provided. 
However, una vailable details of the event will not delay submission of the known information.  As 
additional  details  become available,  the AE/SAE eCRF  will be updated and submitted.  
Reporting to Health  Authority  
After an adverse event requiring 24- hour reporting (per Section 12.5.1, Reporting of Serious 
Adverse  Events to Sponsor ) is submitted by [CONTACT_702943] T/NIAID, there 
are two options for DAI T/NIAID to report the adverse event to the appropriate health authorities 
(Annual Reporting and Expedited Reporting).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Annual  Reporting  
DAIT/NIAID will include in the annual study report to health authorities all adverse events classified 
as: 

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  88 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 • Serious,  expected,  suspected adverse  reactions  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS],  Suspected Adverse 
Reaction, and Section 12.2.2, Unexpected Adverse Event)  
• Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (see Section 12.2.2, Suspected Adverse 
Reaction)  
• Pregnancies  
Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24- hour reporting) will be reported in the 
Annual IND Report.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Safety  Reporting 
This option,  with 2 possible categories,  applies  if the adverse  event  is classified  as one of the 
following:  
Category  1: Serious  and unexpected  suspected  adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
(See Section [IP_ADDRESS], Suspected Adverse Reaction and Section 12.2, Unexpected Adverse Event 
and 21 CFR 312.32(c)  (1)i, Division  5 of the Canadian Food and Drug  Regulations  and ICH E2A). 
The sponsor shall report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. 
The sponsor  shall report  an adverse  event  as a suspected adverse  reaction only if there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event, such 
as: 
1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and kno wn to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens -Johnson Syndrome);  
2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure,  but is otherwise uncommon in the population  exposed  to the drug  (e.g.,  tendon 
rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as  known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates 
those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group.  
 
Category  2: Any findings  from studies that suggests a significant  human  risk 
The sponsor shall report any findings from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], analyses of adverse events within the current study or pooled an alysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro testing 
(e.g. mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity) that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the drug that would result in a safety -related change in the protocol, informed 
consent, investigator brochure or package insert or other aspects of the overall conduct of the 
study.  
 
DAI
T/NIAID shall notify the appropriate health authorities ( FDA and Health Canada) and all 
pa rticipa ting  investigators  of Expedited  Safety  Reports  within  15 calendar  days;  unexpected f atal 
or immediately life -threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) shall be reported as soon as 
possible or within 7 calendar days.  
Reporting  of Adverse Events  to IRBs/IECs 
All investigators shall report adverse events, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion to their respective IRBs/IECs in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines. All Safety Reports  
to the FDA and Health Canada shall be distributed by [CONTACT_73884]/NIAID or designee to all participating institutions  for site IRB/IEC  submission.  
12.6.  Pregnancy  Reporting  

CTOT -[ADDRESS_954241] of care.  
The investigator  sh all  report  to the SACCC  and DAIT/NIAID all pregnancies  within  [ADDRESS_954242] be reported.  The 
Pregnancy  eCRF  shall be updated  an d submitted to SACCC  and DAIT/NIAID when  details  about 
the outcome are availab le.  When possible,  similar  information  sh all  be obtained for a pregna ncy 
occurring in a partner of a study subject.  
Information requested about  the delivery  shall include:  
• Gestational  age at delivery  
• Birth weight,  length,  and head circumference 
• Gender  
• Appearance,  pulse,  grimace,  activity,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (APGAR)  score  at 1 minute,  5 
minutes, and 24 hours after birth, if available 
• Any abnormalities.  
All pregnancy complications that result in a congenital abnormality, birth defect, miscarriage, 
and medically indicated abortion will be considered an SAE. Pregnancies reported as SAEs will 
be submitted to the SACCC, DAI T/NIAID, the FDA and Health Canada using the SAE reporting 
procedures described above.  
12.7.  COVID -[ADDRESS_954243] criteria  for a serious  event  are met, 
the event  should still be reported as an SAE due to its medical  importance.  This event  should be 
reported (entered on the AE/SAE form) within 24 hours of awareness even if the event does not 
meet serious criteria.  
12.8.  Reporting of Other  Safety  Information  
An investigator shall promptly notify the site IRB/ IEC as well as the SACCC using the AE/SAE form 
when an “unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others” is identified, which is not 
otherwise reportable as an AE.  
12.9.  Review  of Safety  Information  
The PI, the DAIT/NIAID Medical  Monitor,  and the NIAID/DAIT Transplant  DSMB will review  safety 
d ata on an ongoing  basis.  Enrollment  and initiation  of study  trea tment  may be suspended at any 
time if any of these reviews conclude there are significant safety concerns.  
Medical  Monitor  Review  
DAIT/NIAID Medical Monitor shall receive monthly reports from the SACCC compi[INVESTIGATOR_457381], SAEs, and pregnancies recorded by [CONTACT_702944] . 
In addition, the Medical Monitor shall review and make decisions on the disposition of the SAE 
and pregnancy reports received by [CONTACT_566771] (See Sections 12.5.1, Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events  to Sponsor , and 12.6,  Pregnancy  Reporting).  
DSMB  Review

Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Planned  DSMB  Reviews  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) shall review safety data at least yearly during 
planned DSMB Data Review Meetings. Data for the planned safety reviews will include, at a 
minimum,  a listing  of all reported AEs and SAEs.  The DSMB will be informed of an Expedited Safety 
Report in a timely manner.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ad hoc DSMB  Reviews 
In addition to the pre- scheduled data reviews and planned safety monitoring, the DSMB may be 
called  upon  for ad hoc reviews.  The DSMB  will review  any event  th at potentially  impacts  safe ty  at 
the request of the study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_692432]/NIAID. Additionally, satisfaction of any of 
the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_702835] 11.5 will trigger  an ad hoc DSMB Safety  Review.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Temporary  Suspension  of Enrollment/Drug Dosing for Ad Hoc DSMB  Safety 
Review  
A temporary halt in enrollment, randomization and administration of Remicade®/infliximab or 
Remicade®/infliximab  placebo will be implemented if an ad hoc DSMB safety  review  is required.

13.4.  
Analysis  Plan  
All analyses will be detailed in a statistical analysis plan.  All analyses will be performed using the 
SAS System version 9.3 (or higher).  
Analysis  Populations.  
• Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Sample  – All transplanted and randomized  subjects  who receive the 
infliximab/placebo infusion. This sample will be used for efficacy and some safety analyses. 
Transplanted subjects who receive an infusion, but have no additional follow up will be 
used in this population 
• Per Protocol  (PP)  Sample  – All randomized  subjects  who receive  the infliximab/placebo 
infusion who are compliant with their medications and do not have any major protocol 
deviations that preclude analysis of the primary endpoint.  
• Safety Sample -  All subjects who receive any infliximab/placebo infusion. This sample will 
be used for some safety summaries/anal yses. 
• Delayed Graft Function (DGF) Sample  –All subjects with delayed graft function. This is 
defined as any dialysis in the first 7 days. This sample will be used for all D GF related 
analyses.  
• Screening  Sample  – All subjects who are enrolled in the study.  This sample will be used for 
disposition summaries.  
Subjects  will be analyzed  in the group to which  they were  randomized,  regardless  of the treatment 
received.  
Primary  Analysis  of Primary  Endpoi nt(s)/Outcome(s) 
All subjects in the ITT sample will be used  for the primary  analysis.  Mean  eGFR  of each  of the two 
treatment arms will be compared within a restricted maximum likelihood repeated measures 
model  (MMRM)  framework,  wherein  repeated  measures  of eGFR  at months  1, 3, [ADDRESS_954251]. 
The following material presents the notation and the model.  
Let 
 
t index the two treatment  arms,  t = 1 for placebo  control,  i.e., rATG  induction in combination with placebo;  
t = 2 for experimental  treatment  arm, i.e., rATG  induction in combination  with infliximab; 

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  94 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 $ s index subjects  within  treatment  arms, s = 1, 2, … , Nt= number  of subjects  in treatment  arm t whose  data 
are in the ITT Analysis  Set of Data (the data from  the subjects  in the ITT Analysis  Set of Subjects  or “ITT 
Analysis Population”);  
m index the post -randomization measurement or evaluation occasions, with m = 1 ↔  month 1 evaluation, 
m = 2 ↔ month 3 evaluation,  m = 3 ↔ month 6 evaluation,  m = 4 ↔ month 12 evaluation, m = 5 ↔ month 
18 evaluation, and m = 6 ↔ month 24 evaluation.  
Ytssm  = eGFR  value  from  subject  number  s (s=1, 2, …, Nt ) within  treatment  arm t (t = 1 for placebo  control, 
i.e., rATG induction in combination with placebo; t = 2 for experimental treatment arm, i.e., rATG 
induction in combination with infliximab), m = 1 ↔ month 1 evaluation, m = 2 ↔ month 3 evaluation, m = 
3 ↔ month 6 evaluation,  m = 4 ↔ month 12 evaluation, m = 5 ↔ month 18 evaluation,  and m = 6 ↔ month 
24 evaluation.  
The MMRM for Ytssm  is, for the values  of t, s, and m given above:  
 
!!"# = #!# + %!" + &!"# 
 
where 
 
μtm = E[Ytsm] is the population mean  eGFR  for subjects  treated  with treatment t and followed for the time 
indicated by [CONTACT_272353] m ; 
δts is the random  effect  on eGFR  associated  with subject  s in treatment  arm t; 
 
εtsm = Ytssm  –(μtm + δts) is the random  component  in the eGFR  measurement  from  subject  s in treatment  arm t 
at evaluation  occasion  m. 
 
Assumptions:  
 
• Each  μtm is an unknown,  fixed  constant  parameter;  an MMRM will be used to estimate  the values  of the 
μtm. 
• Each  δts is a random  variable that is stochastically  independent  of each other δt’s’ where (t,s) ≠ (t’,s’); 
E[δts]=0, '% = ()*(%!") for each combination of t and s 
• Each  εtsm is a random  variable that is stochastically  independent  of each other  εt’s’m’ where (t,s,m ) ≠ (t’,s’,  m’); E[εtsm]=0, '% = ()*(& ) for each combination of t, s, and m. 
& !"# 
It follows  that ()*[! !"#] = '% + '% and Cov[!  , ! ] = 4 '% for m≠m’. That is, the expected -value 
$ & !"#  !"#' $ 
component  of the MMRM is a cell means  model  and the covariance component  is a compound symmetric 
model.  
Let τ denote  the “treatment  effect  at 24 months”,  defined  as 5 = #%,) − #*,), i.e., the difference in 24-month 
population mean eGFR for the experimental treatment minus the corresponding placebo mean.  τ is a 
parameter  of primary  interest; the MMRM will be used to estimate  τ. 
The primary  null and alternative  hypotheses  are: 7+: 5 = 0 vs. 7,: 5 ≠ 0. The MMRM will be used to test 
these  hypotheses  at the α = 0.05 Type  I error rate. 
SAS PROC MIXED (ver. 9.3 or higher) will  be used to fit the MMRM to the data, estimate the 
parameters, and test the primary hypotheses along with others.  
CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  95 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 The mean eGFR  at 24 months  will also be summarized and the difference will be presented  with 
a 95%  confidence interval.  Additional  graphical  summaries  of the eGFR  over time will be used  to 
further  illustrate  any differences  between the two treatment  groups.  MMRM assumptions  will be 
evaluated graphically via standard residual analyses.  If the assumptions  fail, a suitable 
tra nsforma tion (e.g., na tural logarithms) will be utilized a nd the da ta will be reana lyzed on the 
transformed  scale.  Results  asso ciate d  with the F-test for the contrast  and the corresponding  mean  
treatment difference with two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  Missing data will 
not be imputed for the primary  analysis;  however,  a sensitivity  an alysis  will be employed to assess 
the impact of missing data due to subjects who terminate the study early.  
Supportive  Analyses  of the Primary  Endpoi nt(s)/Outcome(s) 
Because subject  drop- outs represent  an important  ar e a to carefully  examine,  (86) we propose to 
compare 1) the proportion of subjects who drop out prior to the 24- month visit (i.e., premature 
withdrawals),  2) the timing  of premature withdrawals,  and 3) reasons  for premature  withdrawals. 
These comparisons will look for differences between treatment  groups tha t could indicate that 
the missing at random (MAR) assumption in the primary analysis model does not hold. 
Additionally,  we will utilize  the methods  of Ma et al (87) to provide an objective index  of the level 
of non- ignorable missingness.  
If the MAR assumption fails, we will perform a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of the 
missing  d ata on our inference.  The first sensitivity  analysis  will use a pattern  mixture  model  (PMM) 
fitted via multiple imputation (88), and is an example of a “cont rolled imputation” method (85,  
89) and will implement a jump to control (89) approach. For subjects who drop out of the study, this method  imputes  missing  values  for both  treatment  groups  from  the placebo population,  which 
reduces any bias away from the null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups.  
Additionally,  we will perform  a second  sensitivity  an alysis  that imputes  a single  point  for subjects 
(in either treatment group) that have had a graft loss or have died.  Specifically, subjects who 
h ave  a gr aft  loss prior  to [ADDRESS_954252]  a “last observation 
carried forward” imputation, which means that we would impute their last known eGFR prior to de ath  for all remaining  eGFR  collection  time points.  This fin al eGFR  would  be b ased  on the central 
evaluation of eGFR  if the collection  time was within  [ADDRESS_954253]  r an ks. 
Subjects  who are missing  their 24-month eGFR  due to other  causes  will receive  a rank  based  on 
an imputed eGFR from the model used in the primary analysis.  
Analyses of Secondary  and Other  Endpo int(s)/Outcome(s) 
The secondary endpoints are to be computed and summarized by [CONTACT_139679], where appropriate,  by [CONTACT_4475]/month  and treatment.  Continuous  var iab le s  will be summarized  using  means 
and standard deviations or, if appropriate, medians and inter -quartile ranges, and categorical 
variables  will be summarized using  frequencies  and percentages.  With the exception of specific 
AEs and lab parameters, proportions or means will be estimated for each treatment arm and 
tested for trea tment  differences  through the use of a statistical  model.  The particular  model  to be 
used depends on the scale of measurement of the endpoint. The accompanying table (Table 
17) lists each endpoint and its measurement scale (continuous, dichotomous, and ordinal). 
Secondary analyses are considered descriptive.  

CTOT -19 Confidential  Page  96 of 121 
Effects  of Inhibiting  Early  Inflammation  in 
Kidney Transplant Patients  Version  9.0 April  27, 2020   
 Longitudinal continuous variables will be modeled using a MMRM similar to the one used to 
analyze the primary endpoint. Non- longitudinal continuous variables will be analyzed using an 
ANOVA (e.g. change from baseline in eGFR). Dichotomous measures of prevalence and 
incidence will be analyzed using a chi -squa re test. Time to event va riables will be ana lyzed by 
[CONTACT_702946] (90).  The change in BANFF  cell-mediated AR score  will 
be analyzed using a generalized McNemar’s test.

We will test a biomarker panel to predict and diagnose incipi[INVESTIGATOR_702838] -transplant markers to define individuals most at risk for late graft 
dysfunction and chronic graft injury. This panel will include reactive T cell (PRT) assays, urinary 
chemokine, urinary PCR assays, gene expression profiles in peripheral blood, and gene expression 
profiles  in gr aft  tissue.  If the compa rison  of the biomarkers  between the two treatment  groups  (see 
previous  paragraph)  yields  no differences,  we will utilize  the entire  study  population.  If, however, 
we find an influence  of the infliximab  on the biomarkers,  we will limit this investigation  to the control 
subjects. This evaluation will be based primarily on examining the Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) Curves gener ated for each candidate biomarker and the associated 
classification accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity as well as positive and negative 
predictive  value.  We will also explore combining the candidate biomarkers  to determine whether 
there are d istinct combinations of biomarkers that may improve performance relative to 
individual biomarkers.  
Our hypothesis  that anti-TNFa  limits  activation of donor  reactive  immunity  an d prevents  initiation 
and progression of graft fibrosis by [CONTACT_702948] a series  of linear  mixed  models.  The assays  to assess  these  effects  will include  T cell 
(PRT)  assays,  urinary  chemokine,  urinary  PCR  assays,  gene expression profiles  in peripheral  blood, 
gene- expression  profiles  in gr aft  tissue,  donor -reactive  effector  T cells,  markers  of inflammation, 
regulatory  T cells,  donor  specific  antibody,  fibrogenic  gene  profiles,  and peritubular  capi[INVESTIGATOR_702839]. 
Models will be fit sequentially, with specific models  fit to address specific elements of the 
hypothesized mechanism. Initially we will use regression models to quantify the extent to which infliximab, when added to therapy with ATG, reduces “early” inflammation at the time of 
transplantation, measured both by [CONTACT_702949] -implantation 
biopsies. Corresponding linear regression models will assess differences between treatment 
groups with respect to inflammation measures at 24 mos., and mixed linear models will be used 
to assess th e inflammation measures over the entire time course subsequent to the “early” 
evaluation.  Additionally,  proportional  odds  models  will be used  to assess  treatment  differences  in 
ordinal grade of graft fibrosis at 24 mos. and, through a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach, over time.  
Should chance imbalances occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_39470], estimates of treatment effects  on 
primary and some secondary outcomes will be obtained from multivariable models that include the treatment factor, the potential confounders and statistically significant interactions between the co var iates  and the treatment  factor. In  particular,  the two ancillary  adherence measures,  the 
standard deviation of tacrolimus trough levels and the MEMS® percentage of predicted 
medication use will be included in the analysis of potential confounding variables.  
Analyses of Safety  Endpoints  
All adverse  events  (AEs)  and serious  ad verse  events  (SAEs)  will be classified  by [CONTACT_702950] (MedDRA).  AEs and 
SAEs will be summarized as the frequency of each event by [CONTACT_1570].

 13.6.  Sample  Size Calculations  
Primary endpoint of eGFR (MDRD) at 24 months: Data from published studies employing similar 
control arms with deceased donor allograft rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_702841], MMF and 
prednisone (BENEFIT trial among others) indicate 24 mo. GFRs range from 55- 70 ml/min with s.d.  
~23-27 ml/min.  Conservatively assuming a s.d. of 25 ml/min, 130 patients per arm will provide 90% 
power  to detect  a difference of 10 ml/min  in eGFR  between  groups  using  a two-sided  two-sample 
t-test at an alpha  level  of 0.05.  We will be able to detect  smaller  differences  in eGFR  should  the 
size of the s.d. be less th an 25 mL/min.  Note  th at in our preliminary  assessment  of eGFRs  in CTOT - 
01, the mean ± s.d. 6 mo. values  were  57.7±  17.1,  a lower  s.d. th at would permit  detection  of eGFR 
differences of < 8 ml/min between groups with 90% power.  
 
Assuming a  15% dropout rate (10% due to death or graft loss, 5% for other reasons) we require 150 
patients per arm.  Based on a sample size of 300 (150 patients/arm), power calculations for  
selected secondary endpoints are given in Table 18.

 16. Protocol  Deviations  
16.1.  Protocol  Deviation  Definitions  
Protocol  Deviation  – The investigators  and site staff will conduct  the study  in accordance to the 
protocol; no deviations from the protocol are permitted.  Any cha nge, divergence, or depa rture 
from  the study design  or procedures  constitutes  a protocol  deviation.  As a result  of any devia tion,  
corrective actions  will be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
Major Protocol Deviation - A Major Protocol Deviation is a deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol that may affect the subject's rights, safety, or well -being and/or the completeness, 
accuracy and r eliability of the study data.  In addition, protocol violations include willful or 
knowing breaches of human subject protection regulations, or policies, any action that is 
inconsistent with the NIH Human Resea rch Protection Program’s research, medical, and ethical 
principles, and a serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or institutional 
human subject protection regulations, policies, or procedures.  
Non-Major Protocol Deviation - A non -major protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or 
departure from  the study design  or procedures  of a research  protocol  that does  not have  a major 
impact  on the subject's  rights,  safe ty  or well-being,  or the completeness,  accuracy  and reliability 
of the study data.  Non-Major Protocol Deviations will not be collected in this study.  
16.2.  Reporting and Managing  Protocol  Deviations  
The study  site principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_702842],  document  and report  protocol 
deviations  as directed  by [CONTACT_157242].  However,  protocol  deviations  may also be identified 
during site monitoring visits  or during other  forms  of study  conduct  review.

 17. Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
17.1.  Statement  of Compliance  
This clinical study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in 
Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol.  Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed 
consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_411780].  The IRB, 
Ethics Committee or relevant health authority (FDA or Health Canada) will also approve any 
amendments to the protocol or to the consent mater ials before they are implemented.  
17.2.  Informed  Consent Process  
The consent  process  will provide  information  about  the study  to a prospective  participa nt  an d will 
allow adequate time for review and discussion prior to his/her decision.  The principal site 
investigator or a study physician designee listed on the 1572, must conduct a meeting with the 
potential study participant to review all of the required elements of informed consent, review the consent form and answer questions.  The conversation between investigator or their physician 
designee and the potential study participant must be documented in p ar t
icipant’s medical  
record. The study physician designee lis ted on the [ADDRESS_954262] be a medical doctor licensed to 
practice medicine in the [LOCATION_002] for US sites and possess appropriate licenses  to practice 
medicine in Canada for the Canadian sites. Coordinators, nurses, physician assistants, nurse 
practitioners, non- physicians listed on the 1572 and other support staff may provide additional 
trainings and discussions to potential study participants, but cannot  serve as the physician 
designee listed above.  
The prospective participant will be told that being in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may 
withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  All participants (or their legally acceptable 
representative)  will rea d,  sign,  and date  a consent  form  before undergoing  any study  procedures. 
Consent materials will be presented in p ar ticipant s’ primary language. A copy of the signed 
consent form will be given to the participant.  
The consent  process  will be ongoing.  The consent  form  will be revised when  important  new safety 
information is available, the protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes available that may affect participation in the study.  
17.3.  Privacy  and Confidentiality  
A 
participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each 
participant  will be assigned  a unique  identification  number  and these  numbers  rather  than names 
will be used to collect, store, and report participant information.  Site personnel will not transmit 
documents containing personal health identifiers (PHI) to the study sponsor or their 
representatives.

receive a separate Sub- study kit for this blood collection.  
2. Day 0 (implantation  biopsy)  can be a wedge  biopsy  or 2 cores.  
3. If unstained  slides  are shipped, these  should be prepared  and mounted  on positively -charged  glass slides  (e.g. Superfrost  Plus treated  slides).  
4. The UV3 visit will occur in subjects whom have reached the month [ADDRESS_954278] visit (LSLV).  
5. Trough levels  will be collected  monthly  from  Month [ADDRESS_954279] -transplant up to Day 7/Visit 07.  If a subject is discharged prior to Day 7/Visit [ADDRESS_954280]  of Care/Surv eillanc e biopsy  results  when  performed  post -transplant,  throughout  the study  follow -up period.

Immersive Virtual Reality to 
Improve Outcomes in Patients with 
Stroke: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
February 24, [ADDRESS_912263] decade, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting -edge technology in stroke 
rehabilitation.  VR is defined as a type of user -computer interface that implements real -time simulation of 
an activity or environment allowing user interaction via multiple sensory modalities.  VR interventions in a 
stroke population have been shown to be equivalent to us ual care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_674981], 
cognitive, and psychological recovery when utilized as an adjunct.  The proposed feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_674982]&D goal of maximizing functional recovery by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_48124] a n immersive  VR 
intervention d esigned to increase exercise dosage  for the upper limb  and decrease pain for inpatient 
Veterans post stroke  without increasing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4284]  [1]. The VR 
intervention will use a head mounted disp lay, more commonly 
known as goggles, to which selected APPs can be uploaded. APPs 
and goggles are commercially available and have been selected 
based on the following criteria: (1)  address the treatment goals of 
overall upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and 
pain reduction , (2) utilized while patient lying in bed, (3) provide 
no stimulation to move legs or reach outside of bed area, (4) 
simple to use (require no technological expertise), (5) involve 
graded head, neck, upper extrem ity movement and distraction to 
reduce pain, and (6) cognitive burden ranges from minimal to 
moderate. The VR intervention will be administered bedside for 
two [ADDRESS_912264], we will us e immersive 3 -dimensional rather than the m ore typi[INVESTIGATOR_83576] 2 -
dimensional VR. Immersion and  the resulting  ‘presence’ within the virtual environment are  thought to be 
the principal mechanisms of positive change [2]. Second, we will assess pain reduction after 
stroke using VR APPs, which is not well represented in the literature.   Third, we are using VR 
as an adjunct therapy - adding additional therapy time with less burden on clinicians  than is required in 
tradition al therapy . Finally, VR, when used  in patients’ rooms, presents an opportunity similar to home -
based practice exercises. Our targeted enrollment is 10 clinical staff ( Research Question (RQ) 1.1) and 10 
inpatient Veterans being treated for stroke (Aim 2).   
 
Specific Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR platform in an 
inpatient comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program.  
RQ 1.1: What is the feasibility of using the VR platform f rom the clinician perspective?   
RQ 1.2: What is the tolerability for inpatients post -stroke using the VR platform?  
Specific Aim 2:  Estimate the initial clinical efficacy, or effect size, associated with the VR platform 
using APPS for distraction  and upper extre mity exercise  for Veterans post -stroke.  
RQ 2 .1: What are the estimated effect sizes and degree of precision for the outcomes of upper 
extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain?  
RQ 2.2: How clinically responsive are dexterity and upper extrem ity neurologic recovery 
(primary) outcomes to early stroke rehabilitation using a therapeutic VR plat form?  
 
Impact.  Veterans and clinicians will gain experience using a portable VR platform  that increas es access 
to care by [CONTACT_674996]. This  
unique experience offers  the potential for seamless transition  from inpatient rehabilitation  to the home. 
Moreover, p olicy makers can observe firsthand the potential benefits an d limitations of using therapeutic 
VR in comprehensive stroke care.  The results of this study will inform a subsequent large r trial, which  will 
focus on the effectiveness  of immersive VR for patients in both the subacute and chronic stages post -
stroke  and will begin inpatient and continue post discharge into the patient’s home.  
Figure [ADDRESS_912265] decade, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting -edge technology in stroke 
rehabilitation.  VR is defined as a type of user-computer interface that implements real -time simulation of 
an activity or environment allowing user interaction via multiple sensory modalities  [3]. VR interventions 
can be characterized as immersive or non-immersive.  Immersion refers to the sensation of being inside a 
particular environment or world, for example, a three -dimensiona l world  [4]. Non -immersive VR typi[INVESTIGATOR_674983], although 
some researchers have developed rehabilitation specific non-immersive VR applications [5-7]. Non -
immersive VR use s 2D interfaces such as Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Xbox, and Sony PlayStation [8-10].   
Immersive VR  uses a 3D virtual environment with the intention of making the user feel a part of , inside , or 
immersed in the environment to the extent that they become unaware of their physical surroundings [4].  
Immersive VR experiences typi[INVESTIGATOR_674984] e of a Head  Mounted Display (HMD) which creates a 
three -dimensional image in all fields of view. We will use the most current VR technology, which at this 
time is a wireless immersive HMD application with hand controllers such as the Oculus Quest.    
Upper Limb VR Research.   Upper limb deficits occur in up to 85% of stroke survivors and 
significantly affect performance of activities of daily living (ADLs)  [11].  The literature on the use of VR in 
stroke rehabilitation is fairly extensive, but is characterized by [CONTACT_34677], lesser quality studies with wide ly 
varying definitions of what constitutes a VR intervention.  The stroke VR literature base has been criticized 
for lack of a control group, making it difficult to discern if positive effects were the result of the VR 
intervention itself or simply the resu lt of extra therapy time, for example, when VR is used as an adjunct 
[12]. Studies on the use of VR for post -stroke upper limb dysfunction have shown mixed results  [4-10, 13 -
17]. A Cochrane Review publ ished in 2017  [18] concluded that overall effects of VR  on upper extremity 
function were not significant ly different when compared with conventional therapy  (including both 
specialized VR systems designed for rehabilitati on or commercial gaming consoles) .  However, when VR 
was utilized as an adjunct to standard care compared with no additional intervention (increased overall 
therapy time), the VR group experienced statistically significant benefits in upper limb function 
(Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.77).  The overall 
quality of the trials included for upper limb function outcomes was low.  The Cochrane Review also found 
a small , yet statistically significant effect of VR  on ADLs (SMD  = 0.25, CI 0.06 -0.43) . Because of the 
heterogeneity in outcomes used in studies investigating the effect of VR on upper limb function post -
stroke , two systematic review s and meta -analys es (SR/MA)  [3, 19]  grouped outcomes by [CONTACT_674997]. For studies that used a virtual world environment approach to VR, 
medium effect sizes (ES) were found: Body Structure/Function ES = 0.43  [3] to 0.54  [19], Activity  ES  = 
0.54 [3] to 0.62  [19], and Participation ES = 0.38  [19] to 0.56  [3]. Gains post  intervention were preserved 
at follow up [19]. A limitation of both  SR/MAs was the variability in how VR was delivered in terms of 
intensity and duration [3, 19]  and lack of clarity regarding  control group therapy.  
Three recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [12, 20, 21]  of non -immersive VR interventions 
(using 2D interfaces) that included control groups dose matched for therapy time found mixed results. A 
single -center study [21] that compared 10 sessions of a self -administered upper extremity rehabilitation 
program including four game applications on a smart phone and tablet with con trol therapy of one hour of 
conventional OT per day found a significant difference on the Fugl -Meyer Assessment -Upper Extremity 
(FMA -UE) at one -month follow -up in favor of the intervention group . In contra st, neither the EVREST trial 
[12] that compar ed 10 sessions of commercial gaming with control re creational activities or the VIRTUES 
multi -center trial [20] that compar ed [ADDRESS_912266] led to significant results . As VR becomes more immersive , 
more interactive,  and less expensive, and because of its flexibility, studies of the use of VR in the inpatient 
environment [22] suggest that VR is efficacious, easy to use, safe, and contribute s to high patient 
satisfaction.  
 VR and Pain.  A recent multi -site study ( N =546) found a 30% prevalence of pain  across the acute, 
subacute, and chronic post -stroke stages [23]. Cognitive factors  (e.g., attention)  are important  to pain 
perceptions , even when people are not engaged in specific tasks [24]. Theory suggests that VR directly or 
indirectly affects cognitive and attentional processes to attenuate pain. VR can be a distraction  
mechanism that consumes cognitive and attentional resources to limit pain processing capabilities [25].  A 
randomized crossove r study found a 56% reduction in time thinking about pain when using VR versus 
self-selected distraction (e.g., meditation, smartphone; p <.001) [26]. VR may also create neurobiological 
interactions in the brain by [CONTACT_674998] t o produce an analgesic effect [27].  Sense of 
immersion and presence are important to  distraction and analgesia because distraction therapy is the 
most commonly used intervention in VR pain research [28]. A rapid evidence assessment of VR (20 
studies, N = 337) found strong evidence for short -term reduction in pain intensi ty and moderate evidence 
for pain analgesia [29]. A meta -analysis (14 studies, N = 581) estimated a large standardized effect (0.90, 
95% CI = .72 to 1.08) for VR pain distraction studies using between -group and mixed -model designs [30]. 
Thus, integration of VR during rehabilitation may have promising  implications for post -stroke pain.  
 Neuroplasticity.  Decades of animal research and recent research in human subjects provides 
compelling evidence that the  adult brain affected by [CONTACT_674999] , with sufficient repetition playing a critical role [31-35].  In patients with subacute stroke, gains 
in the upper li mb and hand dexterity (strength, ROM, speed of movement) require more intensive 
repetitive task practice than gains in lower limb and mobility  [1, 36, 37] .  In addition, task motivation is 
essential for learning [31-35].  Immersive VR exposure is hypothesized to deliver the crucial impetus to 
drive lasting neural changes by [CONTACT_1541] a motivating environment for post -stroke patients to retrain 
movement, ROM, movement speed, fractionation (use of individual fingers), and force production [38]. In 
the proposed study, immersive VR will be utilized as adjunct therapy , allowing patients to increase their 
therapy dose and thereby [CONTACT_675000].    
Immersive VR. Non-immersive VR environ ments are projected on 2D screens (e.g., laptop).   Non-
immersive VR can facilitate stroke symptom improvement [12, 20, 21] , but it is lower on the immersion 
spectrum and less efficacious than immersive 3D VR [28, 39] . Immersion and presence are theoretical 
mechanisms of change which may facilit ate greater learning within virtual environments [25, 40] . 
Immersive VR interventions may be cost -effective and less resource intensive than many traditional 
interventions with comparable efficacy [41]. 
 Significance . According to the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, in Fiscal Year (FY)

neurologic recovery by [CONTACT_675001]’s own intrinsic repair capacity in response to a stroke insult 
(neuroplasticity), but also improve  Veterans’ quality of life by [CONTACT_675002] -efficacy.  
Immersive V R could ultimately become a new standard of care in  acute inpatient rehabilitation, allowing 
unlimited rehabilitation experiences for patients with stroke.  In addition, there is strong potential for 
seamless transition to home, as immersive VR technology rapi[INVESTIGATOR_674985]. Finally, the proposed research supports modernization of the Veterans’ Health Administration by 
[CONTACT_675003] -assisted rehabilitation, addresses the RR&D goal of maximizing functional 
recovery, and focuses on VA Office of Research and Developmen t priorities including access to care, 
mental health, health care value, and pain.  
 
Preliminary Studies  
Virtual Reality Pi[INVESTIGATOR_674986] . In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] [42, 
43] in the James A. Haley Veterans’  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (JAHVH)  inpatient Chronic Pain Rehabilitation Program , [CONTACT_675013] and Fellow, [CONTACT_675014], found evidence for the feasibility of  VR within the  chronic pain  
population as well as a decrease in fear of movement, pain interference with mobilit y, pain intensity, and 
pain catastrophizing. Veteran attendance (91%) and completion of attended 20 -minute VR sessions was 
high (97%). Veterans typi[INVESTIGATOR_674987] 20 -minute VR sessions as ‘too short’.  
 
Research Design and Methods   
Design. Our methodological framework is based on the work by [CONTACT_675004] (VR -CORE) committee [39]; we will use their VR2 clinical study design : conduct ing 
early prospective testing with a focus on fe asibility  and tolerability  (Aim 1 ), and initial efficacy  (Aim 2 ). Per 
VR-CORE guidelines, w e will use a single group so that we may optimize recruitment to represent the 
breadth and depth of our target patient s.  
Population. There are two populations for the proposed project.  The first is Veterans (N=10) who 
have been diagnosed with an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and post -stroke  are admitted to 
JAHVH inpatient rehabilitation.  Inclusion criteria  are: (1) Age 18 -80, (2) Stroke d iagno sis verified by [CONTACT_675005]. Exclusion criteria  are: (1) Unable to follow instructions or participate in immersive VR therapy 
due to significant cognitive  impairment, (2) History of seizures. The second population includes the 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (OT ) and the rehabilitation nurses  (clinician champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458])  working in the 
Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Inpatient Rehabilitation Progra m, who will provide data on the f easibility  
of using VR in an inpatient environment ( Research Question (RQ) 1. 1). 
Recruitment. All patients admitted to the Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Inpatient Rehabilitation 
Program  at JAHVH  (a designated Primary Stroke Center) w ith a diagnosis of acute ischem ic or 
hemorrhagic stroke will be considered for inclusion in the study. A minimum of  five beds will be 
designated for  study participants . The Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Inpatient Rehabilitation Program 
admits 3.[ADDRESS_912268] pool from which to 
enroll the target sample size of 10 patient s (16% of the patients admitted over the 18 -month enrollment  
period).  We have found that the technology is motivating to patients which will help retention.  
Procedure and Data Collection.  
VR Intervention. The VR intervention uses off the shelf technology: Oculus Quest 
Head Mounted Display and commercially available APPs sp ecifically developed or adapted 
for Oculus Quest.  APP selection for individual patients will be guided by [CONTACT_675006].  See Table 1. For example, patients will begin with the green coded APPs, the 
easiest activity level in the toolkit.  T hese APPs primarily address pain via distraction with 
minimal head and neck movement, but no hand movement, required.  As tolerated, 
patients will advance to more difficult APPs which require hand and finger movement, with 
the high -level APPs requiring con trolled movement.

APPs are commercially available and have been selected based on the following criteria: (1)  
address the treatment goals of overall upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, 
and pain reduction , (2) can be utilized while patient lying in bed, (3) provide no stimulation 
to move legs or reach outside of bed area, (4) are simple to use (req uire no technological 
expertise), (5) involve graded head, neck, upper extremity movement and distraction to 
reduce pain, (6) cognitive burden ranges from minimal to moderate. Because hand tracking 
APP technology is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/improving at a rapid pace, upon notice of funding, it is likely that we will 
need to update the VR  Toolkit ( Appendix 4).   
Prior to beginning the intervention, clinician champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] s (OT and nursing)  and 
project manager OT Delikat will be instructed in the use of the head mounted display and 
VR APPs by [CONTACT_675007].   Staff will have the opportunity to practice with the 
head mounted display and APPs for two weeks prior to using the APPs wit h patients.   
Following IRB approval  and funding on site , potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_644482], 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_674989], and/or the project manager in [CONTACT_396847]’s absence. The project manager will use a HIPAA waiver 
to check inclusion and exclusi on criteria.  
 Week [ADDRESS_912270] manager (an OT) will collect baseline data and administer the pre -intervention outcome measures. 
See Table 2. Also, PI/physician Tran , OTs Co-I Winkler  and project manager Delikat,  and 
technology expert Co -I Kaplan will  select  APPs  from the VR Toolkit (Appendix 4) that best 
address the individual patient’s treatment goals , based on his/her current functional level.   
  Weeks [ADDRESS_912271] manager Delikat and  clinician champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458],  overseen by [CONTACT_976] 
[INVESTIGATOR_674989] . The timing of VR sessions will vary based on the patient’s therapy schedule.  During 
the VR session, the patient will be reclining or seated in bed with both bed rails raised.  The 
clinician champi[INVESTIGATOR_674990].  Once the patient is comfortable using the head mounted display with 
VR APPs , the clinician champi[INVESTIGATOR_674991]. The clinician champi[INVESTIGATOR_674992] 30 minutes later to remove the VR head mounted display from the room.  This 
process will be repeated a second time each therapy day. Patien ts can initiate use of a more 
challenging APP (blue category) that gradually includes hand/arm movement. Some 
patients may progress to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_674993]/arm coordination is required.  
Week [ADDRESS_912272] -intervention data will be collected in 
week 5 or at the end of week 4 if the  Veteran is being discharged . RQ 1.2  tolerability  data will be collected 
throughout the subjects’ participation in the study.  
  End of Data Collection .  Once all Veterans have completed the study, RQ 1. 1 feasibility 
data will be collected from clinician champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458].  
Outcomes  
Aim 1. Feasibility  is the degree to which the VR treatment can be successfully integrated 
within the flow of usual care [15] . Feasibility will be measured with a six item survey ( Appendix 5), based 
on the Consolidated Implementation Framework [44], that will be administered to 10 clinical staff  using 
REDCap ®.  Tolerability  refers to the prevalence of patient -reported physical (e.g., vertigo, nausea = 
“cybersickness”) and emotional (e.g., fear and anxiety) adverse effects of the VR treatment, along with 
any discomfort or inconvenience related to the VR equipme nt (e.g., ill -fitting headset, facial discomfort, 
inability to explore the three -dimensional environment fully due to limited mobility, etc.) [2, 39] . Tolerability 
data (c omplaints and adverse events frequencies) will be extracted from detailed meeting minutes where 
such events are reported and discussed.  
Aim 2. See Table 2.  
  
 
Analyses. With the  proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_268074], the overall analytic goals are to : (1) determine the 
feasibility  and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR platform in an inpatient comprehensive stroke 
rehabilitation program  and to (2) estimate, with reasonable precision, t he effect sizes of upper 
extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain reduction outcomes.   
 Aim 1 . Qualitative descriptive analyses [49] will be used to address RQ 1.1  (feasibility) and 
RQ 1.2  (tolerability). For RQ 1.1 , responses will be downloaded from REDCap®. The six survey items  
address three feasibility constructs: adaptability, patient need, and staff comments. Responses  for each 
construct  will be pasted into an excel spreadshee t, one tab for each construct. Respo nses will then be 
grouped by [CONTACT_675008]. Results will be reported as themes and subthemes. Similarly, for RQ 1. 2, 
patient concerns, complaints, and adverse events associated with use of the VR platform will be 
abstracted from the  research team meeting  notes and will be tabulated. Responses will then be grouped 
by [CONTACT_675008]. Results will be reported as themes and subthemes. Note that all adverse events will be 
immediately reported per VA and IRB policy. The analyses described here are for dissemin ation 
purposes.  
 Aim 2. For RQ [ADDRESS_912273] -intervention changes 
on two physical measures of stroke recovery: the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) [45] (Appendix 6)  
and the Fugl -Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke -Upper Extremity [47] (Appendix 7) . Both 
of these measures are scored on a continuous scale, as is the outcome of pain , as listed in Table 2. 
Therefore, the initial step will be to examine distributions of each outcome measure, including distribution 
of change scores from pre - to post -intervention. To estimate effect sizes over [ADDRESS_912274] sizes and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated using the within -
group pre -test/post -test design described by [CONTACT_675009] (2002) [50] and Kadel and Kip (2012) 
[51] . Recognizing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_268074], yet concern over pote ntial type I error due to multiple outcomes 
evaluated, the confidence intervals for the two co -equal primary outcomes will be evaluated with a type I 
error rate of 0.025 (i.e. to determine if the confidence interval for the outcome difference scores includ es 
the null effect size value of 0); secondary outcome  will be evaluated with a type I error rate of 0.01. The 
above confidence interval approach parallels use of the paired t-test to determine statistical significance.  
For RQ 2.1, since the effect sizes to be calculated are standardized measures, corresponding results 
across these outcomes will be directly comparable. However, these metrics do not necessarily translate to 
meaning ful clinical differences (improvements). Therefore, for those outcome m easures with published 
metrics for minimal clinically important difference (MCID)  [52], results of the VR platform will be compared 
across outcomes. As listed in Table  2, the measures of  dexterity and neurologic recovery have published 
references for MCID , whereas we are unaware of a published MCID for the Pain Outcomes Questionnaire 
VA (POQ -VA).  Therefore, for the POQ -VA, we will first determine the change (pre versus post scores) in Table [ADDRESS_912275] (MCID*: chronic=5.7, acute=12) [45, 46]

standard deviation units (from the baseline value) that denotes MCID for the measures of dexterity and 
neurologic recovery. We will then average these two calculations of standard deviation units to estimate 
the magnitude of change in pre -to-post scores on t he POQ that may approximate MCID on this measure. 
Thus, in addition to comparison of standardized effect sizes across the three outcomes measures, all 
three measures will be compared in terms of proportion of subjects who experience MCID.  
Potential Limitat ions and Strategies . As this pi[INVESTIGATOR_203565] a within -subject design to 
evaluate magnitude of stroke rehabilitation over [ADDRESS_912276] a premium on 
evaluating rehabilitation results using MCID, which are highly relevant to patients and generally would not 
be expected to be achieved simply from time alone (4 weeks).  
Project Management Plan. Personnel.  [CONTACT_396847] will lead the administrative and scientific aspects 
of the project  and will be responsible for recruitment and collection of medical data.  [CONTACT_553182]  will oversee 
data management, analysis, and assist with interpretation of data.  Project Manager Delikat , an 
Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT), will obtain informed consent , perform  pre and post data collection , instruct 
study subjects in use of VR technology,  and enter data into the study dataset .  [CONTACT_675016]  and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_674994] , instruct clinicians in use of VR technology , and update 
APPs weekly to meet individual patient needs . [CONTACT_675017]  will serve as a Research Mentor and can 
provide OT exper tise. Joel Scholten, MD  will serve as our Program Partner  from the Physical Medicine 
and Rehabilitation Office.  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_674995] 
(Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] [OT]) daily initially and then twice weekly to monitor participant 
clinical progress, APP intervention progression, and data collection. Technology expert 
Kaplan will be onsite weekly to check equipment  and update APPs. [CONTACT_675016] will be 
available as needed between weekly visits. While the p rimary strategy for team 
coordination will be twice -monthly  research team VA Skype meetings led by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_674989], 
problems will be addressed immediately by [CONTACT_675010].  Scheduled twice -
monthly research team  meetings will bring clinical and researc h team members together to review and 
interpret deidentified findings, discuss and resolve expected and unexpected issues that may arise, and to 
reinforce the project timelines.  
Data Management. [CONTACT_553182]  will create a dataset d uring the first month of the study  using  Excel 
software as Excel is easily imported into SAS for analysis. We have chosen to use Excel on our local 
research server rather than VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) because this is a 
prospective cohort of new admissions an d a relatively small sample. Data will be collected and entered 
into the database by [CONTACT_675011] . Data entry will be verified by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_674989].  Data will be stored 
on the secure JAHVH Research Service R -drive.  
Dissemination. Dissemination will be led  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tran (PI).  Channels for dissemination include: (1) 
annual progress and final summary reports to VA RR&D service; (2) bulleted briefings to our Program 
Partner; (3) presenting findings at national and local research meetings/conferences and VA 
Cybe rseminars and Military Health System Speaker series; and (4) submitting manuscripts to relevant 
peer-reviewed journals.

V 5.0 4 1.0 Background and Significance      
 
1.1 Neurofibromatosis and Cognitive Deficits 
 
NF1 is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 3,000 and is 
characterized by [CONTACT_767780], neurological, skeletal and neoplastic manifestations (North, 
1998). The most common neurological complication of NF1 in childhood is cognitive 
dysfunction (North, Hyman & Barton, 200 2). Knowledge regarding the cognitive profile of 
children with NF1 has dramatically increased over the past [ADDRESS_1155389] shift in the 
distribution of IQ scores when compared to unaffected siblings, controls and normative data 
(Levine, Materek, Abel, O‟Donnell & Cutting, 2006; Ozonoff, 1999).  While general 
intellectual functioning is only mildly affected, one of the most telling areas indicative of 
cognitive deficits in NF1 is academic achievement, with up to 70 percent of school-aged 
children with NF1 underachieving (Brewer, Moore & Hiscock, 1997) and learning disabilities 
estimated to be present in 30 to 65 percent of children (North et a l., 1997). Areas of difficulty 
appear to encompass a range of academic skills including reading, spelling and mathematics, 
with no one area predominately more affected.   
 
As well as academic difficulties, studies consistently show children with NF1 have impaired 
performance on tasks of visual spatial function such as the Judgment of Line Orientation, a task 
associated with activation of the parietal and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_33934] (Hyman, Shores & North, 2005; 
Kesler, Haberecht, Menon, Warsofsky & Dyer-Friedman et al., 2004; Levine et al., 2006).  In 
addition, there is also a high incidence of executive dysfunction, including reduced cognitive 
flexibility, attention, working memory capacity, inhibition and planning; all functions thought to 
be mediated by [CONTACT_252099] (Anderson, Anderson, Northam, Jacobs & Mikiewicz, 
2002; Hyman et al., 2005).  There is also a high incidence of attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD; Mautner, Kluwe, Thakker & Leark, 2002) and results from a recent study 
found that 63% of children with NF1 have poor sustained attention (Hyman et al., 2005). Other 
reported areas of impairment include verbal memory, language and psychomotor deficits 
(Ferner, Hughes & Weinman, 1996; Mazzocco, Turner, Denckla, Hofman, Scanlon et al., 
1995).  
 
Given that general intellectual functioning is not the key explanation for the pattern of observed 
academic failure, it is likely that these specific neurocognitive deficits contribute to or are 
responsible for the characteristic profile of children with NF1.  As such, these NF1 associated 
deficits may negatively impact on daily living skills, academic performance, employment 
opportunities and quality of life (Graf, Landolt, Mori & Boltshauser, 2006; Page, Page, Ecosse, 
Korf, Leplege et al., 2006).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_832216], only one study has reported on treatment outcomes (Mautner et al., 
2002). The results of this study demonstrated that stimulant medication was effective in treatin g 
the behavioral symptoms of ADHD in children with NF1. To date, no studies have examined 
the  
 
 
 
STARS April 13, [ADDRESS_1155390] of NF1 has become critical in explaining the 
spectrum of clinical manifestations of this disorder, from benign and malignant tumor growth to 
cognitive dysfunction.   The NF1 gene encodes a 250kDa protein called neurofibromin which is 
expressed in many tissues, including neurons, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes as well as in 
many non-neural cell types (Daston & Ratner, 1992; Daston, Scrable, Nordlund, Sturbaum, 
Nissen et al., 1992).   Although the function of neurofibromin is not clearly understood, 
neurobiological evidence shows it plays a role in several biochemical processes, including 
adenylyl cyclase modulation (Guo, The, Hannan, Bernards & Zhong, 1997), microtubule 
binding (Xu & Gutmann, 1997) and mammalian target rapamycin signaling (Dasgupta, Yi, 
Chen, Weber & Gutmann, 2005; Johannessen, Reczek, James, Brems, Legius et al., 1995).   
It is the effect of neurofibromin on ras, a protein implicated in cell proliferation and 
differentiation that has been most extensively investigated (e.g., Martin, Viskochil, Bollag, 
McCabe, Crosier et al., 1990; Weiss, Bollag & Shannon, 1999; Xu, Lin, Tanaka, Dunn, Wood 
et al., 1990).  These studies suggest that neurofibromin contains a GTPase-activating protein 
domain that functions to accelerate the conversion of active GTP-bound ras to its inactive GDP-
bound form.  Loss of neurofibromin within a cell would thus result in constitutive activation of 
the ras signaling pathway, ultimately resulting in increased ras activity and unregulated cell 
proliferation and differentiation (Bollag, Clapp, Shih, Adler, Zhang et al., 1996; DeClue, 
Papageorge, Fletcher, Diehl, Ratner et al., 1992; Hiatt, 2001; Martin et al., 1990). 
An important experimental model used to study the effects of diminished amounts of 
neurofibromin on cognitive functioning is the Nf1 mouse model . Importantly, human and mouse 
forms of neurofibromin are highly homologous (98% sequence similarity) as are the promoter 
sequences of the gene, suggesting that both the biochemistry of the protein and the 
transcriptional regulation of the gene are conserved across species (Bernards, Snijders, 
Hannigan, Murthy & Gusella, 1993; Hajra, Martin- Gallardo, Tarle, Freedman, Wilson-Gunn et 
al., 1994).  Silva and colleagues have demonstrated that mice heterozygous for a targeted 
mutation in the Nf1 gene (Nf1 +/- mice) exhibit cognitive deficits associated with enhanced 
GABA inhibition and reduced long-term potentiation (LTP; Costa, Federov, Kogan, Murphy, 
Stern et al., 2002; Costa & Silva, 2002; Silva, Frankland, Marowitz, Friedman, Laszlo et al., 
1997). The Nf1 +/- mouse model of cognitive dysfunction appears to mimic aspects of certain 
cognitive deficits in children with NF1 and is not related to tumor formation (Costa, Yang, 
Huynh, Pulst, Viskochil et al., 2001).  These deficits primarily involve enhanced GABA-
mediated inhibition affecting hippocampal-dependent and prefrontal-mediated tasks, including 
spatial memory and new learning, visual spatial attention, working memory and contextual 
discrimination (Costa et al., 2002; Li, Cui, Kushner, Brown, Jentsch et al., 2005).

V 5.0 6 1.3 Rationale for the Use of Lovastatin in Children with NF1  
 
Lovastatin, a fungal antibiotic, is a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol 
biosynthesis (a non-selective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor), and is widely used in the treatment 
of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_832217] (Xu, McGuire, Blaskovich, Sebti & Romero, 1996). It is one of the 
first-generation statins and therefore has a large body of safety and pharmacokinetic data from 
clinical trials and general use for hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Corsini, Maggi & Catapano, 1995b). Previous 
studies have shown that Lovastatin can inhibit small GTPase (including ras) isoprenylation and 
activity (Sebti, et al., 1991; Mendola and & Backer, 1990 ; Sebti, Tkalcevic & Jani, 1991).  
 
Although it is difficult to draw direct correlations between the murine Nf1 model and the 
neurocognitive changes in children, excessive ras activity and learning impairment observed in 
Nf1+/- mice suggests a possible substrate in part for the cognitive deficits demonstrated in 
children with NF1.  As such, therapeutic interventions designed to decrease ras function have 
been proposed as treatments for NF1 (Weiss et al., 1999).   
 
A recent study by [CONTACT_832266] (2005) used Lovastatin to evaluate its benefit on cognitive 
deficits in Nf1+/- mice.  Nf1+/- and wild-type mice were treated with either Lovastatin or 
placebo before completing a task of attention, visual spatial learning or pre-pulse inhibition. 
Mice completing the pre-pulse inhibition or visual spatial learning tasks were injected with 10 
mg/kg of Lovastatin subcutaneously for three days before training and  Nf1+/- mice completing 
the attention task were administered 0.15 mg of Lovastatin orally, once per day.  Nf1+/- mice 
treated with Lovastatin demonstrated improved performance relative to mice on placebo on all 
cognitive and behavioral measures as follows: 
 
 Attention  – using a lateralized reaction time task, mice treated with Lovastatin were 
significantly more accurate at detecting the location of an unpredictable target stimulus 
than mice in the placebo group.  This measure of divided visuospatial attention is 
dependent on the pre-frontal cortex; 
 Spatial learning  – using the hidden version of the Morris Water Maze (Morris, 1984), 
mice treated with Lovastatin spent significantly more time searching in the target 
quadrant of the maze compared with Nf1+/- mice given the placebo.  This task is 
sensitive to lesions in the hippocampus as well as other structures within the limbic 
system (Mogensen, Moustgaard, Khan, Wortwein & Nielsen, 2005; Steffenach, Witter, 
Moser & Moser , 2005), suggesting the observed improvement in the Lovastatin group 
maybe due to increased LTP (a hippocampus-related learning process; Lynch , 2004), 
which has been shown to be defective in Nf1 +/- mice (Costa et al., 2002; Silva et al., 
1997); 
 Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI)  – Nf1+/- mutant mice treated with Lovastatin had an increased 
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_832218].  PPI [CONTACT_832] a measure of sensory gating of 
environmental stimuli, so that a startle reflex is inhibited if it is preceded by a weak 
prestimulus.  PPI [INVESTIGATOR_832219] 
(Castellanos, Fine, Kaysen, Marsh, Rapoport et al., 1996), which has a high co-morbidity 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 7 with NF1 (38-46% of NF1 children satisfy DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD; 
Hyman et al., 2005; Hyman, Shores & North, 2006). 
 
Interestingly, the dose of Lovastatin effective in Nf1+/- mice did not affect cognitive function in 
control mice, suggesting Lovastatin (which inhibits ras activation) has a beneficial effect on 
cognitive function in the setting of abnormal ras activation (as in NF1), but not when normal 
inhibition of ras activation is intact. 
 
In addition to these cognitive experiments, Li and colleagues (2005) examined the effects of 
Lovastatin a t a biochemical level. T reatment with Lovastatin was found to decrease ras activity 
in Nf1+/- mice as well as reverse LTP deficits.   
 
Collectively,  these results provide strong evidence that Lovastatin can reverse the cognitive and 
physiological deficits observed in Nf1+/- mice to levels comparable to wild-type control mice (Li 
et al., 2005).  Critically, this indicates that the cognitive deficits observed in Nf1+/- mice are not 
caused by [CONTACT_832267].  These experiments outline important parallels between the 
cognitive deficits in mice and humans with NF1 and have relevant implications for the 
development of treatment strategies for these deficits through modification of ras activity or 
GABA mediation (Costa,  et al., 2002 , 2001).   
 
In summary, the highly homologous nature of neurofibromin in mice and humans make murine 
models of NF1 an appealing medium to study the pathologies associated with NF1, such as 
altered molecular pathways and cognitive function.  Studies employing mouse models of NF1 
have been crucial in identifying an increase in ras activity and GABA-mediated inhibition as key 
mechanisms behind the observed cognitive deficits (Weeber & Sweatt, 2002).  Crucially, studies 
have also shown that pharmacological intervention (Lovastatin) not only decreased ras activity 
and GABA-mediated inhibition, but also reversed cognitive deficits.  This suggests that similar 
effects of Lovastatin may also be observed in children with NF1-associated cognitive deficits. 
The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of Lovastatin on the cognitive deficits of 
children with NF1. The use of oral Lovastatin in this study will be the first biologically-based, 
molecularly targeted treatment for children with NF1 and cognitive deficits.  
 
1.4 The Tolerability and Safety of Lovastatin in Children with NF1 
  
The safety and tolerability of Lovastatin in children with NF1 has recently been examined in a 
Phase I open label study. Lovastatin was orally administered to children with NF1 aged 10-17 
years with normal cholesterol levels. Doses of 20, 30 or 40 mg/day were administered using a 
conventional Phase I design, with dose escalation to determine maximum tolerated dose. This 
study enrolled a total of 23 children with a diagnosis of NF1 aged  between 10-17 years. The 
20mg and 30mg cohorts included 3  patients each and the 40mg cohort contained 17 patients.   All 
pati
ents were clinically stable and those with symptomatic intracranial lesions were excluded .  
All three groups were found to tolerate the dose well for the duration of the study (3 month s) and 
no significant side effects specifically related to Lovastatin were reported. Medication was very 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 8 well tolerated in all patients with minimal side effects. Side effects described include: headache, 
nausea and  dizziness. Quantitatively, Lovastatin did not have a significant effect on liver or 
pancreatic enzymes, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, complete blood count 
(CBC), renal function, or lipid profiles, with all laboratory results within normal parameters for 
all patients. Lovastatin did have a significant effect on total cholesterol levels, with a 18% 
decrease in mean levels (range 
 28% to 
 8%) from the pre-treatment to post-treatment. 
However, different subtypes of cholesterol (LDL, HDL, VLDL) stayed within the normal limits. 
The most significant changes were observed in LDL levels, with changes between increments of 
11% to decrease in 45% compared with the initial value. The decrease in cholesterol levels were 
independent of dosage levels and all groups remained within the normal li mits (Acosta et al, 
submitted 2010) 
 
1.5 Lovastatin for Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Children 
 
Evidence from clinical studies indicates the safety of Lovastatin (up to 40mg/day) for the 
treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) in children. The safety and effectiveness of 
Lovastatin in 132 adolescent boys (10 to 17 years of age) with heFH has been evaluated in a 
doubled-blind, placebo-controlled study of 48 weeks duration (Stein, Illingworth, Kwiterovich 
Jr., Liacouras, Siimes et al., 1999). Adolescent boys were randomized to Lovastatin (n=67) or 
placebo (n=65).  The dose of Lovastatin was started at 10 mg/day and increased at eight week 
intervals (8 weeks and 16 weeks) to 20 and 40 mg/day. Treatment with Lovastatin was 
considered safe, and the side-effect profile of the two groups (Lovastatin and placebo) was not 
significantly different.  Additionally, Lovastatin did not have a significant effect on growth 
hormonal, and nutritional status at 24 and 48 weeks.  No significant differences in increase 
serum levels of CPK and/or aspartate amino transferase (AST) were observed between the 
groups. Compared to placebo, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of boys 
receiving Lovastatin decreased significantly by 17%, 24%, and 27% receiving dosages of 10, 20, 
and 40 mg/d respectively (Kwiterovich, Jr., 2001; Stein et al., 1999). 
 
The safety, tolerability and efficacy of Lovastatin was also evaluated in 54 adolescent girls (10 to 
17 years) who were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study over 24 
weeks (Clauss, Holmes, Hopkins, Stein, Cho et al., 2005). Similar to the findings in boys, 
Lovastatin was efficacious at reducing LDL cholesterol by 23% to 27%, total cholesterol by 17% 
to 22% and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) by 20% to 23% at weeks 4 and 24 respectively.  
Importantly, Lovastatin was also found to be safe and well tolerated with no clinically significant 
alterations in vital signs, anthropomorphic measurements, hormone levels, menstrual cycle 
length or tests of liver and muscle function.   
 
In another randomized double-blind trial, the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Lovastatin was 
evaluated in 69 adolescent boys (9 to 17 years) with heFH (Lambert, Lupi[INVESTIGATOR_109685], Gagne, Levy, 
Blaichman et al., 1996). Following a four-week placebo run-in period, the participants were 
randomized to receive active treatment with Lovastatin (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg/day) for eight 
weeks.  Three children who received 30 or 40 mg/day of Lovastatin experienced transient AST 
elevations.  A total of [ADDRESS_1155391] pain, lymph node 
enlargement, and cold-and flu-like symptoms. Adverse events did not appear to be dose related 
(Lambert et al., 1996). There were no serious adverse experiences reported.  None of the 
reported clinical adverse events or laboratory abnormalities required early withdrawal from the 
study. 
 
In general, Lovastatin is considered a safe medication, and has been approved for the treatment 
of familial heFH in children 10 to 17 years old (Clauss et al., 2005; Stein et al., 1999).  These 
studies, combined with results from the aforementioned Phase I study (Acosta et al., submitted), 
indicate that Lovastatin in doses of 40mg/day should be safe and well-tolerated in children with 
NF1.  
1.[ADDRESS_1155392] examined the potential cognitive effects of Lovastatin in humans. In one 
study, cognitive effects were assessed in adults with heFH who were randomized to receive 20 
mg Lovastatin (n=98) or placebo (n=96) over a 6-month period (Muldoon, Barger, Ryan, Flory, 
Lehoczky et al., 2000). Results from this blinded randomized control trial indicated that at 6 
months follow-up, control participants had improved on all five domains of cognitive 
functioning (attention, psychomotor speed, mental flexibility, working memory and memory 
recall), most likely due to practice and/or learning effects. Participants on Lovastatin improved 
only on measures of memory recall. Further sub-analysis indicated that only participants treated 
with Lovastatin with a lower mean LDL cholesterol level at follow-up (mean 109 
  11mg/dL 
(2.79 
 0.28mmol/l)) had a small decrease in cognitive function from baseline. However, total 
serum cholesterol in the lower range (<200mg/dL (5.13mmol/l)) has been associated with poorer 
performance on cognitive measures which place demands on abstract reasoning, 
attention/concentration, word fluency and executive functioning (Elias, Elias, D‟Agostino, 
Sullivan, Wolf et al., 2005). Therefore, it plausible that lower cholesterol levels contributed to 
poorer cognitive performance observed by [CONTACT_832268]. (2000).  
 
Other studies that have examined cognitive performance of adults with heFH when treated with 
Lovastatin generally report no significant effect on measures of cognitive performance (Kostis, 
Rosen & Wilson, 1994; Gibellato, Moore, Selby & Bower, 2001). However, one study found that 
after four weeks of treatment with Lovastatin, patients with heFH performed significantly better 
on one cognitive task (digit symbol substitution) when compared to baseline (Gengo, 
Cwudzinski, Kinkel, Block, Stauffer et al., 1995). There were no significant changes for other 
cognitive tasks.  
 
In summary, no studies have examined the potential cognitive effects of Lovastatin in individuals 
without heFH. The results from studies of individuals with heFH suggest no significant cognitive 
effects of Lovastatin. This is consistent with observations in control mice, in that the dose of 
Lovastatin effective in reversing cognitive deficits in Nf1+/- mice did not affect cognitive 
function in control mice (Li et al., 2005). However, it is important to consider that our current 
study is targeting a population that has a metabolic alteration that is susceptible to modifi cation

1.7 Use of Lovastatin for the Treatment of Other Conditions 
 
Lovastatin has been used in several other clinical trials, including Phase I studies of adult 
participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head, neck, or cervix  
and in other solid tumors with maximum doses of between of 7.5 mg/kg  and 45mg/kg/day 
(Knox, Siu, Chen, Dimitroulakos, Kamel-Reid et al., 2005; Thibault, Samid, Tompkins, Figg, 
Cooper et al., 1996). Thibault and colleagues (1996) conducted a Phase I trial to characterize the 
tolerability of Lovastatin administered at progressively higher doses to cancer patients.  They 
were treated with a 7-day course of Lovastatin given monthly (over a 20 month period), with 
doses ranging from 2 to 45 mg/kg/day.  They found cyclical treatment with Lovastatin reduced 
cholesterol concentrations by [CONTACT_8622] 43% when compared with pre-treatment levels. Very high 
doses of Lovastatin (25 mg/kg/day) were very well tolerated for seven days. Myopathy was the 
dose limiting toxicity and found to be prevented by [CONTACT_832269] (Thibault et al., 
1996). In another Phase I study for treatment of cancer in adults, Lovastatin has been used in 
doses up to 7.5 mg/kg/day for up to 28 days with a good tolerability and limited side effects 
(Knox et al., 2005).  In this study, the major side effects were related to myopathy and renal 
insufficiency (Knox et al., 2005). Doses even higher up to 45 mg/kg/day have been used for a 
seven day cycle per month up to 20 months with similar findings (Thibault et al., 1996). Current 
studies are not conclusive about the benefits of Lovastatin in cancer however in most of the 
cases, the dosage exceeded the maximum recommended dose for the standard treatment of heFH 
(current dose recommended in adults is up to 80 mg/day). Doses used in the aforementioned 
studies have been calculated in most cases by [CONTACT_832270]/weight (up to 45 mg/kg/day).  
 
Lovastatin also has been used in patients with adrenoleukodystrophies to decrease very long 
chain fatty acids, where dosage was increased  from 20mg to 40mg in two weeks (Pai, Khan, 
Barbosa, Key, Craver et al., 2000). No significant changes in cholesterol levels and no 
correlation between the dose and decrease of cholesterol levels were shown (Pai et al., 2000). 
Side effects were reported in 2-3%, including weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, 
dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, myalgia, muscle cramps, dizziness, headache, skin rash, and 
blurred vision (Pai et al., 2000). One patient had adverse events severe enough to discontinue 
Lovastatin. Lovastatin-induced myopathy or marked elevation of CPK is expected to occur in 
<1:500 participants undergoing such therapy for heFH (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_835], Wysowski & GrossPi[INVESTIGATOR_835], 1990; 
Marais & Larson, 1990). 
 
1.8 Comparisons between the Nf1 Murine Model and Children with NF1   
 
While results from Nf1+/- mice provide evidence that Lovastatin may be effective in treating 
cognitive deficits in children with NF1, it is difficult to make direct comparisons between the 
Nf1 murine model and the neurocognitive functioning of children with NF1. The precise 
mechanism underlying the Lovastatin reversal of the cognitive phenotype in Nf1+/- mice is not 
completely understood. In addition, results from animal studies are limited in their direct

Briscoe et al., 2006). The lack of concordance may be due to bias, random error or the failure of 
animal models to mimic human disease adequately (Perel et al., 2006).  
Cognitively, the capabilities of mice are limited to basic levels of functioning and it is not 
possible to assess the full effects of Lovastatin using this model.  Thus, the potential effects of 
Lovastatin in children with NF1 may not be fully realized by [CONTACT_832271]. It is possible that the neurocognitive functions targeted by [CONTACT_832272]1.  For example, it is possible that the action of Lovastatin on 
LTP (i.e., it has shown to increase LTP in Nf1 +/- mice relative to placebo controls) could form 
and strengthen neural connections not only in the hippocampus (associated with learning and 
memory), but also induce similar effects of neural connectivity and plasticity throughout the 
brain of children with NF1, resulting in significant improvements across a variety of cognitive 
domains. 
 
1.9 Ratio nale for Outcome Measures: Neuropsychological Assessment 
  
Neuropsychological assessment plays a critical role in identifying and monitoring central 
nervous system (CNS) dysfunction in children with developmental, acquired, and medical 
disorders, including NF1.  Objective standardized tests assessing general cognitive ability and 
specific neuropsychological domains are reliable and valid measures that are sensitive to changes 
in CNS function, including cognitive improvements from pharmacological treatments (e.g. 
Bedard, Martinussed, Ickowicz & Tannock, 2004; Tucha, Mecklinger, Laufkotter, Klein, Walitza 
et al., 2006). As a result, neuropsychological test scores have been extensively used as cognitive 
outcome measures in clinical trials, including those with children (e.g., Bedard et al., 2004; 
Kempton, Vance, Maruff, Luk, Costin et al., 1999; Mehta, Goodyer & Sahakian, 2004; Mohr & 
Brouwers, 1991).  When selecting neuropsychological tests to be used in clinical trials, various 
guidelines should be followed (Ruff & Crouch, 1991).  First, tests should be selected that will 
assess the specific cognitive domains that are affected and may be changed by [CONTACT_3148].  
Second, as the tests need to be administered repeatedly, it is optimal that alternate forms be used 
where possible to minimize test-retest effects.  Finally, the tests should be standardized measures 
with documented reliability and validity. 
 
The selected measures in this study are drawn from both traditional pencil-and-paper 
neuropsychological tests as well as two computerized tasks which are sensitive to detecting 
treatment effects –  the Cambridge Neuropsychological Testing Automated Battery (CANTAB, 
reviewed by [CONTACT_832273], 2003) and the Conners‟ Continuous Performance Test-II (CPT-II; 
Conners, 2000).  The CANTAB is a neuropsychological assessment battery that consists of 22 
stand-alone subtests (we will administer 4 subtests only), developed to assess aspects of visual 
spatial learning, executive function, attention, semantic/verbal memory, decision making and 
response control.  The CANTAB was selected as an outcome measure for a number of reasons. 
First, it has a number of subtests, including a visual spatial learning task that may potentially be 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, [ADDRESS_1155394] subtle cognitive dysfunction and 
changes over time than traditional paper-and-pencil neuropsychological measures (Bedard et al., 
2004; Froestl, Gallagher, Jenkins, Madrid, Melcher et al., 2004; Makdissi, Collie, Maruff, Darby, 
Bush et al., 2001; Nestor, Scheltens & Hodges, 2004).  
 
In this study, the primary outcome measures have been selected based on the effects of 
Lovastatin in murine models of NF1 and the cognitive functions that are frequently impaired in 
children with NF1.  Therefore, the primary outcome measures assess visual spatial learning and 
sustained attention. Visual spatial learning will be assessed using the Paired Associate Learning 
(PAL) subtest from the CANTAB (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Preliminary findings indicate that 46% 
(13/28) of children with NF1 performance on the PAL is impaired (>1SD below normative 
mean; Payne, Barton & North, unpublished data). Sustained attention will be assessed using the 
Score! subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch). Previous findings 
indicate that 63% (50/80) of children with NF1 have impaired performance (>1SD below 
normative mean) on the Score! subtest (Hyman et al., 2005). 
 
Since evidence from the murine model of NF1 suggests that Lovastatin may improve functions 
that rely on prefrontal cortex, such as response inhibition and the effect of Lovastatin on 
cognitive impairments is not known, a broader battery of neuropsychological tests have been 
included as secondary outcome measures.  These include multidimensional measures of attention 
(selective, divided and switching attention from the TEA-Ch; see Hyman et al., 2003, 2005, 
2006), executive functioning (e.g. response inhibition, planning and organization) and 
visuospatial ability, as well as quality of life. 
  
The other computer-based measure, the CPT-II, has a significant history of use in identifying 
attentional deficits and the effects of stimulant medication (e.g., Boonstra, Kooij, Oosterlaan, 
Sergeant, & Buitelaar, 2005; Conners, Epstein, Angold, & Klaric, 2003). CPTs have been used 
in previous studies of children with NF1 (Ferner et al., 1996; Mautner et al., 2002; Mazzocco et 
al., 1995). Results from a recent study using the Kiddie‟s CPT, indicated that children with NF1 
made significantly more omission (inattentive) errors than the control group (Irle, Shores, Watt 
& North, unpublished data). 
 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, [ADDRESS_1155395] common neurological complication of NF1 in childhood is cognitive deficits for which 
there are no effective specific pharmacological treatments. Studies indicate that Lovastatin can 
reverse the biochemical, electrophysiological and cognitive deficits observed in Nf1+/- mice to 
levels comparable to wild-type control mice. Nf1+/- mice treated with Lovastatin demonstrated 
improved performance on tasks of spatial learning and memory (as measured by [CONTACT_832274] s 
Water maze), attention, and pre-pulse inhibition. These tasks are hypothesized to reflect the 
cognitive deficits observed in children with NF1. The Morris Water Maze involves mechanisms 
of learning and memory, which relies on hippocampal functioning. While visual-spatial deficits 
have been reported in children with NF1 (e.g., Schrimsher, Billingsley, Slopis & Moore, 2003), 
no studies have reported on the visual spatial learning abilities in this cohort. 
 
Lovastatin, which targets the inhibition of ras, is a logical choice as a potential therapeutic 
intervention for children with NF1 and cognitive deficits. Clinical trials indicate that Lovastatin 
is effective and safe to treat heFH in adults and children. Results from a recently completed 
Phase I trial indicate that Lovastatin is safe to be used in children (10-17 years) with NF1 
(Acosta et al., submitted ).  
 
Currently, no studies have examined the effect of Lovastatin on cognitive functioning in 
individuals with NF1. This study will determine the efficacy of Lovastatin as a treatment for the 
cognitive deficits observed in children with NF1. We will conduct a multi-center randomized, 
double-blind, Phase II trial with two treatment arms (Lovastatin/placebo) for 16 weeks. Based on 
predictions from the NF1 murine mouse model, it is expected that children with NF1, who are 
impaired on a visual spatial learning task and/or an attention task, will benefit from Lovastatin.

STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 14 It is hypothesized that Lovastatin will improve the visual spatial memory and/or attention deficits 
in children with NF1. This is based on studies demonstrating that Lovastatin has significantly 
improved impairments in visual spatial memory and attention in the NF1 murine model.  
 
It is further expected that Lovastatin will be safe and well tolerated over a 16-week period. 
 
3.0 Research Design and Methods  
 
3.1 Study Design 
 
This is a prospective multi-cent er; randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study to determine 
the efficacy o f Lovastatin on visual spatial learning and/or attention abilities of children with 
NF1 aged [ADDRESS_1155397] therapy with established efficacy 
is being withheld. There is no cross-over in this study due to a lack of data concerning the length 
of possible washout effects.  The Lovastatin dose will begin at 20 mg once daily/continuous 
dosing and escalate over a two-week period to 40 mg once daily/continuous dosing and continue 
at this dose for [ADDRESS_1155398] Selection 
 
This is a Phase II study involving children with NF1 (aged 8 years to less than 16 years at time of 
screening) with evidence of cognitive impairment, defined as having a score of at least one 
standard deviation or more below the population mean on a measure of visual spatial learning 
and/or attention.  
 
A total of 142 participants with NF1 aged 8 years to less than 16 years will be enrolled in the 
study. The age limits were selected on the basis that Lovastatin has been shown to be safe and 
well tolerated in children aged between 10 and 17 years old. Lovastatin has been extensively 
used in children 10-17 years of age with hypercholesterolemia, with minimal side effects. Also, 
results from Phase 1 study indicate that Lovastatin is safe and well tolerated in children with NF1 
aged 10-17 years (see section 1.4). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_832220] 8 and 9 years of age, we do not anticipate higher risk of side effects 
in this age group compared with children 10 years and older. During the phase 1 study (Acosta et 
al., submitted), 4 patients aged 10 years participated in the study. In all cases, no side effects or 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 15 significant changes in metabolic parameters were observed in this group compared with the older 
patients. In addition, metabolic pathways related to the metabolism of drugs, including 
Cytochrome P450 complex, are approximately developed up to 70% after the perinatal period 
(Lange, Pharmacology). It is considered fully developed by 5 years of age (Anderson et al 2009). 
Adjustments in the doses are related with changes in weight mainly. We do not expect changes 
in toxicity in this younger age group and those patients will be monitored closely as per study 
protocol during the study for immediate identification of any risk(s) or side effect(s). 
 
In addition, one of the primary outcome measures (attention) only has normative data for up to 
15 years 11 months. Therefore, the maximum age limit for participants at time of enrolment is 15 
years 11 months so that normative data can be used to determine whether participants are 
impaired. The pediatric NF1 population is an ideal group in which to study the cognitive effects 
of Lovastatin because it represents an opportunity for early pharmacological intervention of 
cognitive deficits.

5.0 Study Procedures 
 
An overview of the study procedures can be found in Appendix 3 . 
 
5.1 Pre-Treatment 
 
The pre-treatment phase of this study consists of obtaining informed consent, an initial 
evaluation and enrollment process,  as well as a screening for eligibility.  
 
5.1.1 Screening and Informed Consent 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 19   
The study will be described in detail to participants and their parents/legal guardians at an initial 
visit. If the participant and family agree to participate in the study, the applicable assent, consent 
and HIPAA documents will be signed (see Appendix 4). After informed consent has been 
obtained, a screening assessment will be performed.  The screening assessment will include a 
medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. The site psychologist will also 
administer the primary outcome measures (see section [IP_ADDRESS]) and an abbreviated IQ measure 
which is estimated to take [ADDRESS_1155402] one of the primary outcome measures of 
visual spatial learning or sustained attention (≥ 1SD below the normative mean) and an IQ equal 
to or above 70. Unless the patient has undergone an IQ test with in six months of screening, IQ 
will be assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; Wechsler, 1999). 
If the participant has recently completed an IQ test (within six months of screening), then this 
score will be used for the purposes of screening. Examples of acceptable IQ tests include (but are 
not limited to) the WASI, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 4th Edition (WISC-IV), 
and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales 5th Edition (SB-V). 
 
If the child fails to satisfy the screening criteria, parents will be verbally informed of the reason 
why the child did not meet the criteria. If the reason for exclusion was a Full-Scale IQ less than 
70, parents will be verbally informed of the range of the child‟s IQ score and that it may indicat e 
the presence of an intellectual disability. Parents will be advised that only a brief assessment of 
IQ was conducted and that the child‟s performance may vary due to motivation, attention and 
fatigue. It will be recommended to parents that their child undergo a full IQ assessment to obtain 
further information about their child‟s intellectual functioning. Upon request, results of the IQ 
test will be provided to parents in a written report. 
 
5.1.2 History and Physical Examination 
A complete medical history and physical examination (including neurological examination) will 
be performed initially to confirm each participant‟s NF1 diagnosis and to document any 
complications that they might have from the disease. Height, weight, head circumference, blood 
pressure, and pulse will be recorded . Patients will also be given a list of medications to avoid 
while on this study.  To be eligible participants must have not taken any stimulant medications 
for at least [ADDRESS_1155403] two weeks prior to 
commencing the study medication.  The following studies will be performed: 
 Hematology : Complete blood count (CBC); 
 Chemistries : Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), asparate aminotransferase (AST), CPK and, Lipid profile (HDL, Cholesterol, 
LDL, Triglycerides), total bilirubin and direct bilirubin (indirect bilirubin will be 
computed from total and direct bilirubin serum measurements);

childbearing age before commencing study medication and at weeks [ADDRESS_1155405] ed during the 
study period.  
 
5.1.4 Baseline Assessment - Neuropsychological Outcome Measures 
 
Within one month of enrollment and before initiation of treatment, participants will be 
administered all primary and secondary outcome measures as outlined in section [IP_ADDRESS]. The 
child‟s history will also be reviewed with the family to gather information about the child‟s 
cognitive development and behavior. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Outcome Measures   
 
The effect of Lovastatin on cognitive functioning in children with NF1 has not been examined. 
Evidence from a murine model of NF1 suggests Lovastatin improves visual spatial learning and 
memory, and attention.  As such, the following primary outcome measures are:  
 
 Visual Spatial Learning and Memory 
*CANTAB Paired Associate Learning (PAL)  
PAL is a measure of arbitrary visuospatial associations. It involves the randomized „opening‟ of 
six boxes that are displayed on the screen, each revealing a different pattern. Immediately after 
presentation of the six patterns, each item reappears in the central box in random order and the 
participant has to indicate where each item was first seen.  Measures include the number of 
patterns placed correctly on the first trial and the number of repeat presentations needed to learn 
all the associations correctly. Administration time for this measure is approximately 10 minutes. 
 
 Attention 
*Score! Subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children  (TEA-Ch: Manly, Robertson, 
Anderson & Nimmo-Smith, 1999).  
The TEA-Ch is a normed and standardized multi-subtest battery that assesses various aspects of 
attentional function in children aged between 6 years and 15 years 11 months. The Score! subtest 
requires children to keep count of sounds they hear on a tape.  This task does little to „grab‟ the 
child‟s attention and is a measure of their ability to self-sustain his or her own attention. Previous 
findings indicate that approximately 63% of children with NF1 are impaired on Score! (Hyman 
et al., 2005).  There are two alternate forms for this subtest and it takes approximately 8 minutes 
to complete.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Secondary Outcome Measures 
 
 Attention

STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 21 In addition to the Score! subtest, three other subtests from the TEA-Ch will also be used in this 
study: Sky Search (visual selective attention), Sky Search Dual Task (divided attention between 
visual and auditory information), and Creature Counting (attentional control/switching). The test 
is normed for children 6 to 15 years 11 months and there are two alternate forms available. 
Administration time for these three subtests is approximately 20 minutes. 
 
*Conners‟ Continuous Performance Task – II (CPT-II: Conners, 2000) 
CPT-II is a computerized measure of sustained attention and concentration.  It is a 14-minute 
computerized test that requires the child to discriminate targets (X‟s) from nontargets (letters of 
the alphabet).  Various measures calculated by [CONTACT_832277], omission 
and commission errors, change in reaction time speed and consistency.  This test takes 
approximately 14 minutes to administer. 
 
Parent version of the Conners ADHD/DSM-IV Scales  (CADS: Conners, 1997) 
The CADS-P is a published questionnaire that uses observer ratings to help assess the presence 
of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors in children and adolescents and directly 
corresponds to the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The parent version of the questionnaire will be 
administered, which contains 26 items (12 items ADHD index, 9 inattentive items and 9 
hyperactive-impulsive items).  It takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The CADS- P 
is a subjective outcome measure of attention. 
 
 Executive Functions 
*CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM)  
This is a test of the participant‟s ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate 
remembered items in working memory.  It is a self-ordered task that also assesses heuristic 
strategy.  Administration time for this test is approximately 10 minutes. 
 
*CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge (SOC)  
This is a test of spatial planning and problem solving (aspect of executive function), which is 
based on the „Tower of London‟ test (Shallice, 1982).  Administration time for this measure is 
approximately 10 minutes. 
 
*CANTAB Stop Signal Task (SST)  
This is a classic stop signal response inhibition test that uses interleaved staircase functions to 
generate an estimate of stop signal reaction time.  SST gives a measure of the participant‟s 
ability to inhibit a response.  Administration time for this task is approximately [ADDRESS_1155406]  (COWAT; Benton & Hamsher, 1989) 
The COWAT assesses the executive aspects of language processing, including verbal fluency 
and concept formation.  It requires children to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_832225] (i.e., F, A and S). The test is normed for children between 7 to 16 years of 
age (Anderson, Lajoie & Bell, 1995).  Administration time for the COWAT is approximately 5 
minutes.

V 5.0 22 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Parent - Report Form  (BRIEF; Gioia, Isquith, 
Guy & Kenworthy, 2000; Guy, Isquith & Gioia, 2004)   
The BRIEF is a published clinical questionnaire assessing executive function in the home and 
school setting.  The Parent Form is completed by [CONTACT_2252]‟s parent or guardian.  It contains 86 
items, with eight clinical scales and two validity scales. Behavior descriptors of a child are rated 
on a three-point Likert scale: “never,” “sometimes,” “always.”  Items were developed to capture 
everyday behaviors associated with executive functions, and tap eight domains including: 
initiate, inhibit, shift, plan, organize, self-monitor, emotional control, and working memory.  
These scales are combined to form two broader indices (Behavioral Regulation and 
Metacognition) and a Global Executive Composite score. The Parent Form is normed for 
parents of children aged 5-18 years old.  This questionnaire takes approximately 15 minutes to 
complete. 
 
 Visual Spatial Skills 
*Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO: Benton, Varney & Hamsher, 1976) 
The JLO is a motor-free untimed measure of spatial perception and orientation. JLO requires 
participants to judge the spatial directionality and size of angles. Two alternative forms of this 
test are available.  These tests take approximately [ADDRESS_1155407] Assembly  (Wechsler Scale for Intelligence – Third Edition; WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991)

participants are required to put together puzzle pi[INVESTIGATOR_832226]. 
This test takes approximately 13 minutes to complete.  
 
 Behavior 
Behavior Assessment System for Children - Second Edition  (BASC-II; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 
2004) 
The BASC-II is a multidimensional system used to evaluate the behavior and self-perceptions 
of children and young adults aged two through 25 years.  The Parent Rating Scales is a 
comprehensive measure of the child‟s adaptive and problem behaviors in community and home 
settings, which takes 10 to 20 minutes to complete.  It assesses various internalizing and 
externalizing problem behaviors as well as adaptive skills.  The Self-Report of Personality is a 
personality inventory for children and adolescents, and young adults, which takes about 30 
minutes to complete.  It assesses various internalizing problems, hyperactivity/inattention, 
personal adjustment and school problems. 
 
 Quality of Life 
The Pediatric Quality of Life Scale  (PedsQL: Varni, Seid & Kurtin, 2001) 
The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent proxy-
report scales to assess health-related quality of life in children and adolescents aged 2 to18 
years. There are parallel child and parent scales, which include self-report forms for children, 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011

emotional, social, and school.  It takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete. 
 
 Visuospatial Learning and Memory 
Computer Generated Arena  (CGA: Astur, Taylor Mamelak, Philpott & Sutherland, 2002) 
The CGA is an optional computerized clinical outcome measure that will be performed after 
completion of all secondary outcome measures. It is a virtual environment task that has been 
developed as a “Human Morris Water Maze” (Astur et al., 2002; Kallai, Makany, Karadi & 
Jacobs, 2005). The task requires children to use a joystick controller to navigate a circular 
“arena” to locate an invisible target hidden on the floor. The walls of the arena contain cues, such 
as windows that remain in place. The fixed target must be located in subsequent trials, each time 
starting from a new location. This test takes 10-15 minutes to administer and will only be 
conducted at the following sites: The Children‟s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342964], Children‟s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_832227]‟s National Medical Center. 
 
In addition to these measures, Motor Screening (MOT) from the CANTAB will also be 
administered.  MOT is a simple pointing task that measures psychomotor speed and introduces 
the participant to the touch-screen apparatus, ensuring they can touch the screen accurately, and 
can hear, understand and follow instructions. The mean latency to touch a cross is measured. 
MOT takes approximately 5 minutes to administer.   
 
All primary measures will be administered at screening. The length of time required for the 
child to complete the remainder of the baseline neuropsychological assessment is estimated to 
be 128 minutes (98 minutes testing and 30 minutes to complete self-report questionnaires). It is 
esti
mated that parent questionnaires will take 55 minutes to complete (see Appendix 5). All 
neuropsychological assessments that will be used in this study are published tests that have 
normative data that is both reliable and valid for the age range in this study . These tests are all 
extensively used in clinical and/or research settings. All tests have standardized instructions for 
administration ensuring there will be no site variation in administration.  
 
To minimize any test-retest effects for neuropsychological outcome measures, alternate forms 
(indicated by „*‟ in the above sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]) will be used where possible, to 
minimize potential practice effects. Furthermore, the use of a placebo group will allow us to 
identify any potential practice effects and distinguish whether any changes in the treatment 
group are larger than those accounted by [CONTACT_412442] i.e. a treatment effect. In addition, 
statistical analysis of the data will be conducted to account for confounding variables such as 
practice effects (see Section 8). 
   
5.1.5 Randomization 
 
Following a successful screening period, the participant will be randomized to one of the two 
treatment groups: Lovastatin or placebo. Randomization will be implemented by [CONTACT_832278] a permuted blocks approach .  
 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, [ADDRESS_1155408] at each participating site will be unmasked. The drug 
distribution center will be provided with the randomization sequence and treatment assignment 
directly by [CONTACT_36909]. 
 
Both treatments (Lovastatin and placebo) will be distributed from the Pharmacy Department at each 
site. Except for the pharmacist, all staff will be blinded to the treatment sequence at each site.  
 
The success of blinding will not be evaluated. While the CONSORT checklist previously stated 
that the success of blinding should be evaluated this statement has recently been removed from 
the CONSORT checklist as it was deemed that testing for blindness may not generate valid 
answers (Sackett, 2007). 
 
5.2 Treatment Visits 
 
5.2.1 Dose Schedule and Prescription 
 
Eligible participants will be dispensed 20mg of Lovastatin or the placebo at the initiation of 
treatment.  Participants will be given directions to take the medication once daily after dinner 
time. Given that Lovastatin has a strong odor; participants will be required to swallow the 
capsule whole without breaking the seal. Participants will take one tablet (20mg Lovastatin ) per 
dose for two week s; and increase to two tablets per dose during the following weeks (40 mg 
Lovastatin). Participants will continue on the same dosage for a total of [ADDRESS_1155409] be completely avoided while being treated 
with Lovastatin (see Appendix 6 ). 
 
5.2.2 Clinical Evaluation 
 
Throughout the treatment phase of the study, participants will be clinically evaluated every 4 
weeks (
 4 days) by a neurologist or a qualified physician at each site.  At each visit, an interim 
medical history and physical examination (including a neurological examination) will be 
performed. Height, weight and body surface area will be obtained. Participants will be assessed 
for toxicity/side effects and safety labs will be performed as specified in section 5.1.3 every 4 
weeks (
 4 days). Medication compliance will also be assessed at these visits. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_832228] 13, 2011

treatment period, all unused medication will be collected and dispensed of properly on a per site 
basis according to clinical procedures and guidelines. 
 
5.2.3 Off-Study Criteria (Note: See Section 6.6 for modifications for toxicity information) 
 
A participant will be taken off the study for the following reasons: 
 The participant refuses further treatments and/or wishes to withdraw from the study;  
 For participants concurrently taking stimulant medications (methylphenidate and/or 
de
xtroamphetamines), they will be withdrawn from the study if they stop or change the dose 
or type of  stimulant medication before the ir final study visit; 
 It is deemed in the best interest of the participant to stop the study by [CONTACT_5051]; 
 Serious protocol violation or non-compliance as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_832230];  
 The development of significant drug toxicity, such as recurrent grade 3 or 4 toxicity after dose 
reduction; and/or persistent grade > 2 toxicity for >10 days without administration of the drug;  
 The development of a concurrent serious medical condition that might preclude or 
contraindicate the administration of Lovastatin; 
 Death.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1155410]-Treatment 
 
The following tests and procedures will be performed at the end of the 16-week treatment period 
(unless participants have come off treatment early): 
 Medical history and physical examination;  
 Laboratory studies as specified in section 5.1.[ADDRESS_1155411] and total bilirubin, CPK and complete lipid profile; 
 All outcome measures will be re-administered 16 weeks (± 4 days) after treatment 
commenced (and the day it is terminated). In exceptional situations where participants are 
unable to attend the post-treatment assessment at week 16 (± 4 days), the post-treatment 
assessment will be conducted earlier, but as close to week [ADDRESS_1155412] four weeks since 
the baseline assessment (unless the reason is non-compliance of medication). It is estimated 
that it will take the child approximately 1 48 minutes (118 minutes testing and 30 minutes 
self-report questionnaires) to complete the primary and secondary outcome measures. It is 
estimated that parent questionnaires will take 55 minutes to complete.   
 
5.4 Follow-up 
 
To determine any carry-over effects in the present study, a follow-up assessment will be 
conducted 8 weeks (± 7 days) post cessation of treatment. As treatment status will be blinded, all 
participants will be re-administered all outcome measures and laboratory tests (excluding 
pregnancy test) at follow-up. While no existing data exist on the carry-over effects of Lovastatin,

intensively trained in the relevant specific procedures before contact [CONTACT_20688], which 
includes providing informed consent/assent, family/child interviews, the administration and 
scoring of tests, maintenance of confidentiality, data collection and handling, and procedures for

pharmacokinetic data from clinical trials and general use for hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Corsini, et al., 
1995a).  
1. It is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding b-hydroxyacid, a 
potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is the basis for 
an assay in pharmacokinetic studies of the b-hydroxyacid metabolites (actives inhibitors) 
and, following base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma 
following administration of Lovastatin ;  
2. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled Lovastatin in men, 10% of the dose was excreted in 
urine and 83% in feces. Plasma concentrations peaked at two hours and declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_832231] 10% of peak by [ADDRESS_1155414] dose;  
3. Lovastatin is highly bounded (>95%) to human plasma proteins. Animal studies 
demonstrated that Lovastatin crossed the blood brain and placental barriers;  
4. The major active metabolites present in human plasma are the b-hydroxyacid of Lovastatin , 
its 6‟-hydroxy derivative, and two additional metabolites. Peak plasma concentrations of 
both active and total inhibitors were obtained within two to four hours of dose 
administration;  
5. The recommended dose in children 10 to 17 years old is 10-40 mg/day ([COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc, 
2007); 
6. It is metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_35233] P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, with less than 
10% being excreted renally (Kantola, Kivisto & Neuvonen, 1998); 
7. With a once a day dose regimen, plasma concentrations of total inhibitors over a dosing 
interval achieved a steady state between the second and third days of therapy and were 
about 1.5 times those following a single dose (Vree, Dammers, Ulc, Horkovics-Kovats, 
Ryska et al., 2003). When Lovastatin is given under fasting conditions, plasma 
concentrations of total inhibitors were on average about two thirds those found when

6.2 Drug Company/Supply/Distribution 
 
Based on an estimate from Eminent Corporation, funds included in the budget will be used to 
purchase Lovastatin and its matching placebo and distribute Med Kits to participating sites.  
Eminent Corporation will also be responsible for study medication reconciliation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
 
6.3 Procedures/Recommendations for Drug Supply and Distribution 
 
Lovastatin and its matching placebo will be obtained and distributed to participating sites by a 
subcontractor to the Operations Center.  A 20mg tablet of Lovastatin or an identical tablet 
(placebo) will be provided for each participant.  Medications, including the placebo, will be 
provided to the participants free of charge.  Participants will be instructed to return all unused 
medications as well as empty bottles at each clinic visit.  All unused medicine will be disposed of 
properly at each individual site.  
 
Lovastatin is administered orally.  The bioavailability of the tablet increases under the influence 
of a meal. Based on these findings, it is advised to take the tablets immediately after a meal. One 
dose per day after dinner time will be instructed to parents, since evening doses are more 
effective than the same dose given in the morning ([COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc, 2007). Lovastatin is a 
substrate for cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4). Grapefruit juice contains one or more 
components that inhibit CYP3A4 and can increase the dose concentration. Participants will be 
instructed to avoid the consumption of grapefruit juice during the treatment. A complete list of 
drug interactions/contraindications will be described to parents and participants.  
 
Compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_832280][INVESTIGATOR_832233].  
Participants will be asked to return all unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_832234]. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_832235]-up visit to ensure compliance with 
the medication. 
 
6.4 Drug Dosage and Possible Interactions 
 
The selection of the maximum dose of Lovastatin to be used in this study, 40 mg/day, is based on 
the tolerability of the drug when used for heFH and the results of the Phase I study examining 
safety and tolerability of Lovastatin in children with NF1 (Acosta et al., submitted ).  Participants 
will commence at 20 mg/day for two weeks and escalate to the 40 mg/day dose in week 3.   
 
Approximately 40% of children with NF1 are diagnosed with comorbid ADHD, many of whom 
are treated with psychostimulant medication such as methylphenidate and/or 
dextroamphetamines. In order to minimize recruitment bias and ensure recruitment targets are 
met, patients taking methylphenidate and/or dextroamphetamines will be eligible for this study. 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, [ADDRESS_1155416] of methylphenidate is de-esterification to form 
pharmacologically inactive d- or l-ritalinic acid (Patrick et al 1987). Metabolism of 
methylphenidate when used by [CONTACT_832281] a stereoselective clearance to 
ritalinic acid (CES1A1 is the major enzyme responsible) before entering systemic circulation 
(Sun et al, 2004). Methylphenidate does not use the microsomal cythochrome P450 in the liver 
for its metabolism (Sun et al 2004; Patrick et al 1987). Dextroamphetamines are metabolized by 
[CONTACT_832282] P450 in liver. However the isoenzyme responsible for its metabolism is the 
CYP2D6 (Adderall Medication Guide, Shire, Nov. 2010). Instead, lovastatin is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_2750]3A4 (Ritalin® Medication Guide, [COMPANY_001], 2010). There are not described interactions 
or competitive mechanism between dextroamphetamines and lovastatin.  
 
Although limited by a small sample size, results of the Phase I study provide some evidence for 
the inclusion of patients on stimulant medication (Acosta et al., submitted). A total of 23 patients 
with NF1 (10-17 years of age) completed 12 weeks of treatment with Lovastatin. Nine patients 
had a diagnosis of ADHD and five of these patients were taking a stable dose of stimulant 
medication during the course of the study. Calculation of Reliable Change Index for individuals 
indicated significant improvements on both verbal and nonverbal memory measures in 
approximately 40% of participants regardless of whether they were off or on methylphenidate.  
 
The list of psychotropic medications is quite extensive. As many psychotropic medications may 
interact with the metabolism of Lovastatin, e.g. Fluoxetine, patients taking psychotropic 
medications other than stimulant medications will be excluded from the study. Also, participants 
on other medications to control behavior (including Straterra) and anticonvulsants will not be 
eligible to participate in the study as these medications are known to affect cognition and 
learning and, thus, confound the results of the study. However, these participants may be eligible 
if they cease medication for at least [ADDRESS_1155417] frequent side effects of

critical therapeutic decisions are contingent on knowing the assigned study medication.  Except in 
the most pressing circumstances, a decision to break the blind must be discussed with the 
Operations Center, Chair of the Protocol Committee or the Chair‟s designee from the Protocol 
Committee and permission in writing must be obtained before the blind may be broken.  
Withdrawal of a participant from the study is not a sufficient reason to break the study blind. 
 
If the blind is broken, the pharmacist will record key information at the time the blind is broken.  
Information to be collected includes the participant number and initials, medication kit number, date 
the blind was broken, reason for breaking the blind, the name [CONTACT_832299], the name [CONTACT_832300], and the names of the Clinical 
Review Committee members who authorized breaking the blind.  A member of the Clinical Review

6.7 Adverse Event Monitoring ([LOCATION_006] sites please refer to Appendix 10) 
 
Participants will be monitored closely for medication side effects with a diary and with 
laboratory testing as indicated in the Study Procedures section (see of the protocol (see Section 
5). Adverse events will be addressed immediately as described in Section 6.8.  Participants will 
also be closely followed clinically at least once per month while on the study medication by [CONTACT_832283]. The Side Effects Checklist and Adverse Event Monitoring Form will be used to 
assess participants at every visit or phone contact. 
 
Participants will be monitored for adverse events regularly throughout the study. Adverse events 
are any unfavorable or unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom or 
disease temporarily associated with the use of medical treatment or procedure regardless of 
whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated,

that places the participant at an immediate risk of death from the reaction. Serious adverse events 
are any event occurring at any dose level that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a 
life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of an existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent/significant disability/incapacity, and other medically significant 
events. Unexpected adverse events not listed above may also occur. 
 
All observed or volunteered adverse events will be recorded on the Adverse Event form. Events 
involving adverse drug reactions, illnesses with onset during the study or exacerbation of pre-
existing illnesses will be recorded. Objective test findings, such as abnormal lab values, that 
result in drug dosage changes will also be recorded. 
 
6.8 Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Adverse events will be graded according to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program‟s; Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4 (CTCAE), which can be downloaded from 
http://ctep.cancer.gov . A severity grading of side effects related to Lovastatin use can be found in 
Appendix 7 . The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_832236]. If deemed to be related, the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_832237]. Details of the event 
(expected or unexpected),  and whether the side effect and severity (i.e. toxicity) were included in 
informed consent (yes/no), will be recorded on the adverse event module form. 
 
A justification will be recorded on the adverse event module if the observed toxicity was not 
included in the informed consent. For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain 
information to determine the outcome of adverse events and to assess whether it meets the 
criteria for classification of a serious adverse event. All serious adverse events require immediate 
notification to the Operations Center. All adverse events, whether serious or otherwise, will be 
followed until resolution (the patients health has returned to his/her baseline status) or until the 
event has stabilized (investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the 
adverse event). Participants withdrawn from the study due to adverse events will be followed by 
[CONTACT_117186]. All grade 3, [ADDRESS_1155420] (DSMB).  The occurrence of adverse events will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_680723] 2-month intervals to monitor patient safety. Summary details of the occurrences 
and grade of adverse events will be distributed to each site at 2-monthly intervals. It will be the 
responsibility of the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_832238]‟s 
institutional review board. In addition, all unexpected and serious adverse events will be 
forwarded to the medical monitor, Tena Rosser, M.D. She will serve as a patient advocate, will 
be independent of the clinical study team, and will report to the DSMB. She will oversee the 
progress of the protocol, especially issues of individual subject/patient management and safety.

6.11 Risks and Protection from Risks 
 
Individual risks in this study are associated with the use of Lovastatin,  laboratory tests (blood 
drawn) and with neuropsychological testing.   
 
Lovastatin has been shown to be safe and effective in a pediatric population for treatment of 
familial HeFH. The FDA has approved Lovastatin (40mg/day) for treatment of HeFH in childre n 
and it is believed to be safe to extend to other potential uses. The most frequent side effects of 
Lovastatin are muscular pains, weakness and tenderness, and gastrointestinal conditions such as 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, [ADDRESS_1155423] study medication withheld and/or modified as outlined in Section 6.6. 
Additionally, there will be regular monitoring and clinical evaluation. 
 
In the 24 patients that were evaluated for the Phase 1 Lovastatin study, few patients‟ total 
cholesterol dropped below 100, and in all cases, the HDL:LDL ratio was within normal limits. In 
all cases total cholesterol returned to baseline after the treatment.  From a clinical perspective, 
decreased LDL is one of the desirable outcome s of using Lovastatin. There is no evidence of 
increase risk or harmful consequences for a temporal decrease of LDL levels. Since this is a 16 
week study (plus follow-up), transient decrease in lipid profile levels will not change the risk for 
this patient population. 
 
Since the long-term effects of lowering lipid levels in the children on Lovastatin are unknown at 
this time, having normal range cholesterol (cholesterol >  90 mg/dL) is a criteria for enrollment.  
In addition, a lipid profile is checked at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24.  If levels drop 
below 80 mg/dL, the site should notify the protocol team for guidance. If other lipid profile 
levels drop below normal values, the site should also notify the protocol team for guidance. 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_832240] 8 or 9 
years of age, we anticipate no changes or higher risk of side effects, compared with the older 
children. Date from a phase 1 mentioned before (Acosta et al., submitted), demonstrated no 
differences in tolerability or side effects in children 10 years of age compared with older 
children. In addition, metabolic pathways related with metabolism of drugs, including Cythrome 
P450 complex, are fully developed by 5 years of age (Anderson et al 2009). We do not expect 
changes in toxicity in this younger age group and those patients will be monitored closely during 
the study to early identify any risk(s) or side effect(s). Any metabolic alteration or adverse event 
observed in this specific group age will be notified to the Protocol team for careful evaluation. 
 
There is some pain and a small risk of bruising associated with blood collection, which can be 
minimized by [CONTACT_2931] a topi[INVESTIGATOR_832241]. 
 
There are minimal risks associated with neuropsychological assessments. All the tests in this 
study are routinely used in clinical and/or research neuropsychological evaluations. As such, they 
are not expected to result in any undue stress in the child. Some children, particularly younger 
children, may become tired during the assessment. If this happens, the child can take short 
breaks. At the beginning of the session, the child will be told by [CONTACT_832285]. They will also be told that they may find some questions easy and others a little 
harder, but not to worry if they cannot answer all questions, as some are for older children. The 
majority of tests have a discontinue rule, so that testing is stopped if the child makes a certain 
number of consecutive errors. This ensures that the child does not become anxious or frustrated. 
If a participant worries that they are unable to answer a question, the test administrator will 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 34 reassure the child that he/she is not expected to answer all the questions and it is only expected 
that he/she try his/her best on the task. All test administrators will have psychological training 
and experience with interacting and assessing children. If for some reason the child states that 
he/she does not want to continue, the assessment will cease. We will then consult with the parent 
and child to ascertain whether the testing will continue. 
 
There are an estimated six partial or whole days that a child could miss school while 
participating in this trial.  We will recommend to the parent (parents, legal guardians) that he/she 
should discuss school policies for excused absences and make necessary arrangements for make-
up work. 
 
 
 
7.0 Statistics 
 
Determination of sample size : No data exist on the effects of Lovastatin in children with NF1. 
A clinical and meaningful difference for primary efficacy measures is defined as an effect size of 
one half of a standard deviation, which is classified as a treatment effect of medium magnitude 
(Cohen, 1988). A sample size of 64 participants per treatment group (128 total) will be sufficient 
to detect an effect size of half a standard deviation at the two-sided 0.05 significance level with 
power of 0.80 (Peat, Mellis, Williams & Xuan, 2001).  To allow for a 10% dropout rate prior to 
the 16-week point, a total of 142 participants will be enrolled.  
 
Interim analyses : Interim analyses will be done under the purview of the DSMB, which will set 
the content and frequency of analyses.  We will propose a Charter containing a data monitoring 
plan that will include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15381].  We expect these to be the Lan DeMets modifications 
of the O‟ Brien Fleming boundaries (Lan & DeMets, 1983; O‟Brien & Fleming, 1979) ).  It is 
expected that the DSMB will review this charter during its first meeting. 
         
Data analysis:  Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for each group 
using descriptive statistics. Intention- to-treat analyses will be conducted for the primary 
outcomes measures. An intention- to-treat analysis provides an unbiased, conservative and 
consistent estimate of a treatment effect (Heritier, Gebski & Keech, 2003).  
 
Analyzing change scores from baseline to post-treatment does not control for baseline imbalance 
because of the regression to the mean (Vickers & Altman, 2001). Also, with changes scores, if 
the treatment is effective, the statistical significance of the treatment effect will depend upon the 
correlation between baseline and follow-up scores. Therefore, to determine whether there has 
been a significant change from baseline to post-treatment, primary and secondary outcomes will 
be analyzed using ANCOVA, which is a better approach than analyzing change scores with 
independent t- tests (Vickers & Altman, 2001). 
 
In addition, at an individual case level to determine whether test-retest change scores from 
baseline to post-treatment are reliable and clinically meaningful, standardized regression based 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 35 change scores (RBC) will be also be calculated. RBC can account for measurement error, 
differential practice effects and regression to the mean (Sherman et al., 2003). However, RBC 
scores do not necessarily indicate whether a significant change from baseline has occurred 
(Sherman et al., 2003).  Similar statistical analysis will be conducted for scores from post-
treatment to follow-up. Linear mixed models may also be conducted to examine changes over 
time. In addition, a number of sub-group analyses are planned to help identify individuals more 
likely to benefit from, or be harmed by, the treatment. In regard to treatment effects, definition of 
subgroups will rely on baseline data, not data measured after randomization. Such subgroups 
might include age (including comparison of 8-9 years to 10 years and older), gender , and 
presence of ADHD (on or off stimulant medication) (if there are sufficient cases). Exploratory 
data derived through subgroup analyses will serve primarily to generate new hypothesis for 
subsequent studies.  
 
8.0 Data Management 
 
Data sets will follow all standards as per Data Coordinating Center‟s guidelines and 
recommendations. All paper charts, forms, and information associated with this study will be 
kept in a locked cabinet at the clinical sites. Access to this cabinet is available only to 
investigators on the study and research assistants. All participant information from this study will 
be strictly confidential. On entry to the study, participants will be assigned a unique PIN that will 
be used throughout the study. All data stored in computer systems will be password protected 
and stored using participant PI[INVESTIGATOR_832242] (see next section for more information regarding database 
security). Participant names will not be used in any computer databases associated with this 
project. A list of participant names and coordinating PI[INVESTIGATOR_832243]-protected principal investigator‟s computer. This information will be kept in 
accordance with the requirements of the Department of Defense.

Body.  The EAB will review and approve the protocol with respect to ethical and safety standards. 
Its primary responsibility will be to monitor the emerging results of the trial to assess treatment 
representatives are ex officio  members of the EAB. The EAB will determine the content and 
frequency of safety reports it will review and will periodically review interim analyses of data 
collected for this study. 
 
In addition, the DSMB will protect the integrity of the study by [CONTACT_832286]. This will be achieved by [CONTACT_832287]-out rates. In the event that the number of 
accrued patients is less than 20% of the planned value, the DSMB will advise on appropriate 
remedial action. Possible remedial actions may include, but are not limited to, the extension of 
the recruitment period, review and amendment of inclusion criteria. 
 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, [ADDRESS_1155425]. Tena Rosser will be the medical monitor for this study. She is a qualified physician and is not 
associated with this protocol. She will work closely with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_410105]‟ treatment while on this study. The medical monitor is required to review all 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious adverse events and all subject 
related deaths associated with the protocol, providing an unbiased written report of the event. At 
minimum, the medical monitor should comment on the outcomes of the event or problem, and in 
the case of a serious adverse event or death, comment on the relationship to participation in the 
study. The medical monitor should also indicate whether she concurs with the details of the 
report provided by [CONTACT_1704]. Reports for events determined by [CONTACT_832288]. 
 
It is expected that summaries of accrual, retention, and adverse events will be disseminated to the 
clinical centers periodically.  To maintain the blind, adverse events will be aggregated across 
treatment arms.  
 
8.2 Confidentiality 
 
Data will be obtained and stored consistent with IRB and HIPAA guidelines. All participant 
charts, standardized study forms, and information associated with this study will be kept in a 
locked cabinet in the principal investigator‟s office. Access to this cabinet is available only to the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_44200]. All participant information from this study will be 
strictly confidential. On entry to the study, participants will be assigned a unique participant PIN 
that will be used throughout the study. All data stored in computer systems will be password 
protected and stored using PI[INVESTIGATOR_832244]. Participant names will not be used in any computer 
databases associated with this project. A list of participant  names and coordinating PI[INVESTIGATOR_832245]‟s computer. This information

medication side effects, risks, benefits and alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_832246]/legal guardians. Potential participants will be allowed to 
take their time in deciding whether to join the trial and will be given privacy to make their 
decision. They will also be encouraged to discuss their concerns or questions about joining the 
trial with their parents/guardian.  Consent will be obtained from parents/legal guardians and 
assent will be obtained from children aged [ADDRESS_1155426] benefit on their cognitive abilities 
(namely their visual spatial learning and/or attention). It is possible that Lovastatin may 
additionally have a positive effect on secondary outcome measures. After the participant has 
completed the trial, a report of their neuropsychological assessment will be provided to the 
parents to assist the child in the school environment. This will include a summary of the child‟s 
cognitive strengths and weaknesses based on the neuropsychological assessments. If cognitive 
weaknesses are found, strategies will be offered with the aim to help parents and educators 
manage the cognitive difficulties. Recommendations for additional support/services will also be 
provided as necessary. At the conclusion of the trial, participants will be sent a summary of the 
research findings with no personal identifying information. If the results show that Lovastatin is 
efficacious in treating cognitive impairments, this will lead to a Phase III study to determine its 
effectiveness in the general NF1 community. 
 
The current study will contribute to the treatment of cognitive impairments associated with NF1. 
It will provide additional information regarding the safety of Lovastatin in children with NF1 and 
cognitive deficits. As mechanisms related with cholesterol metabolism and similar pathways that 
imply Ras pathway activation has been implicated in other models of learning.  These results 
may have a more generalized benefit.  Through this study, there is the hope to gain a better 
understanding of the neurobiology and extent of cognitive difficulties in children with NF1.

participant availability and recruitment measures for the clinical trial. At recruitment, the side 
effects of the medication, as well as its use in children with NF1 (Phase I), will be reviewed with 
parents. The system for monitoring side effects will also be discussed. Parents and children will 
have the opportunity to ask questions regarding use of the medication and will be able to 
withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
Participants will be stratified to study medication by [CONTACT_832289]. The requirement for 
multiple visits may result in some attrition in the sample due to difficulties keepi[INVESTIGATOR_832247]. We have included a 10% attrition rate in the calculation of a sample 
size. To assist in the retention of participants, we will have regular contact [CONTACT_832290].  The investigators, study coordinator, and research assistant will 
work closely with the families to facilitate their return and maximize participation. All 
participants will be required to attend scheduled visits. This will allow us to monitor any side 
effects and may also indirectly assist in maintaining treatment compliance.  
 
Lovastatin has been shown to be safe and effective in a pediatric population for treatment of 
familial heFH. Although unexpected adverse events may occur, frequent monitoring as well as

V 5.0 60 APPENDIX 10: Adverse Event Monitoring –  [LOCATION_006] Sites 
 
Participants will be monitored closely for medication side effects with a diary and with 
laboratory testing as indicated in the Study Procedures section (see of the protocol (see Section 
5). Adverse events will be addressed immediately.  Participants will also be closely followed 
clinically at least once per month while on the study medication by [CONTACT_120636]. The Side 
Effects Checklist and Adverse Event Monitoring Form will be used to assess participants at 
every visit or phone contact. 
 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical 
condition occurring after the study has commenced, even if not considered to be related to the 
investigational medicinal product.  Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the study 
will only be considered as adverse events if they worsen after the start of the study.  Abnormal 
laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or 
symptoms, are considered clinically significant, require therapy, or as specified on CTCAE, 
version 4. 
 
The 
occurrence of adverse events will be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the patient 
during the study.  Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_832296], laboratory test, or other assessment.  As far as possible each 
adverse event will be evaluated to determine: 
 
1. The severity (mild, moderate, severe) 
2. Its relationship to the investigational medicinal product 
3. Its duration 
4. Action taken (no action taken; study drug dose adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued; concomitant medication taken; non-drug therapy given; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176388]) 
5. Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one which: 
 Is fatal or life-threatening 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Requires prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] (except where it is for routine 
treatment/monitoring, elective or pre-planned treatment not related to study, for 
social or respi[INVESTIGATOR_832262]) 
 Is medically significant i.e. defined as an event that jeopardises the patient or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above 
 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements (see below).   
 
All adverse events will be recorded in detail, reported to the sponosor and treated appropriately.  
Such treatment may include changes in study drug treatment including possible interruption or 
discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 61 of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or any other medically required intervention.  Once an adverse 
event is detected it will be followed until its resolution, and assessments will be made at each 
visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to 
the investigational medicinal product, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
 
Evaluation of AEs and SAEs  
Seriousness, causality, severity and expectedness will be evaluated for each AE.  Cases that are 
considered serious, possibly, probably or definitely related to drug (i.e. serious adverse reactions, 
SARs) and unexpected (i.e. S[LOCATION_003]Rs) should be reported as described below. 
 
Assessment of Seriousness  
The Investigator should make an assessment of seriousness as defined above (see definitions). 
 
Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator must make an assessment of whether the AE/SAE is likely to be related to 
treatment according to the following definitions.  All AEs/SAEs judged as having a reasonable 
suspected causal relationship (e.g. possibly, probably, definitely) to the study drug will be 
considered as ARs/SARs.  If concomitant or rescue/escape drugs are given, the Investigator must 
also make an assessment of whether the AE/SAE is likely to be related to an interaction between 
the study drug and concomitant or rescue/escape drugs or whether the AE/SAE might be linked 
to either the study drug or concomitant or rescue/escape drugs but cannot be attributed to only 
one of these drugs.  All AEs/SAEs judged as being related (e.g. possibly, probably, definitely) to 
an interaction between the study drug and concomitant or rescue/escape drugs, or any AE/SAE 
that cannot be attributed to only the study drug or the concomitant or rescue/escape drugs  will 
also be considered to be ARs/SARs . 
 
Unrelated:  where an event is not considered to be related to the study drug. 
Unlikely: the adverse event is doubtfully related to the study medication.   
Possibly:  although a relationship to the study drug cannot be completely ruled out, the nature of 
the event, the underlying disease, concomitant medication or temporal relationship make other 
explanations possible. 
Probably:  the temporal relationship and absence of a more likely explanation suggest the event 
could be related to the study drug. 
Definitely:  The known effects of the study drug or its therapeutic class, or based on challenge 
testing, suggest that study drug is the most likely cause. 
 
Alternative causes such as natural history of the underlying disease, other risk factors and the 
temporal relationship of the event to the treatment should be considered and investigated. 
 
Assessment of Severity based on CTCAE (version 4)  
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE/SAE and record this on the 
Adverse Event (AE) Form according to one of the following categories: 
Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities. 
 
 
 
STARS April 13, 2011   
V 5.0 62 Moderate:  an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities. 
Severe: an event that prevents normal everyday activities. 
 
Assessment of expectedness  
If an event is judged to be an AR/SAR, the evaluation of expectedness will be made based on 
knowledge of the reaction and the relevant product information documented in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC). 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting  
Any SAE will be reported by [CONTACT_079] (including a completed SAE form) 
within [ADDRESS_1155471] knowledge to the Sponsor.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_832263].  They will also determine whether the SAE is a S[LOCATION_003]R 
(Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction).  If it is deemed to be a S[LOCATION_003]R it will be 
reported immediately to the sponsor.  The Regulatory Competent Authority (MHRA) and 
Research Ethics Committee will also be informed in accordance with Trial regulations.  An 
annual safety report will be sent by [CONTACT_832297], the Ethics Committee 
and sponsor.  Completed initial and follow-up Serious Adverse Event forms should be faxed to 
the sponsor on 0161 276 5766 and addressed „For the attention of the Quality Manager‟.  
Alternatively, scanned forms can be emailed to [EMAIL_15807] . 
 
Regulatory Reporting Requirements  
The sponsor, or their delegate, has a legal responsibility to notify the Regulatory Competent 
Authority and the Research Ethics Committee that approved the trial.  Fatal or life threatening 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported no later than [ADDRESS_1155472] study visit should be 
monitored until resolution of the event or until no longer medically indicated. 
 
Criteria for premature termination of study  
These criteria include new safety data, or concerns from safety data (number and nature of 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs); or evidence from other studies. 
 
Pregnancy  
It the event that pregnancy does occur in a patient an any time between commencement of the 
study and 28 days after completion or termination of the study the pregnancy will be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications.  Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on a Pregnancy Reporting Form.  After

during pregnancy will be reported on the SAE Report form. 
 
All serious adverse events require immediate notification to the [LOCATION_006] co-sponsor and US 
Operations Center. All adverse events, whether serious or otherwise, will be followed until 
resolution (the patients health has returned to his/her baseline status) or until the event has 
stabilized (investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the adverse 
event). Participants withdrawn from the study due to adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_194675]. All grade 3, [ADDRESS_1155473] (DSMB).  The occurrence of adverse events will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_680723] 2-month intervals to monitor patient safety. Summary details of the occurrences 
and grade of adverse events will be distributed to each site at 2-monthly intervals. In addition, all 
unexpected and serious adverse events will be forwarded to the US medical monitor, Tena 
Rosser, M.D. She will serve as a patient advocate, will be independent of the clinical study team, 
and will report to the DSMB. She will oversee the progress of the protocol, especially issues of 
individual subject/patient management and safety. The monitor will provide an unbiased written 
report of each event.

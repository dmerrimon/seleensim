Phase of Development  Phase 3  
Background and Rationale  Combined administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen has been shown 
to provide superior analgesia over administration of comparable doses of 
either component alone or placebo, when given  as an intravenous 
formulation or as a solid oral tablet in the postoperative setting. This has  
been demonstrated in three Phase 2/[ADDRESS_512492] molar removal or arthroscopic knee surgery using oral tablets of 
Maxigesic® (acetaminophen 500 mg + ibuprofen 150 mg), in one Phase 3 
clinical study in dental surgery patient s with Combogesic® (acetaminophen 
325 mg + ibuprofen 97.5 mg) and in one Phase 3 trial in bunionectomy 
patients using Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + ibuprofen 3 
mg/ml in 100 ml solution for infusion).  
 
The superior efficacy of the combination does not appear to come at the 
expense of tolerability. In the Phase 3 study of Maxigesic® IV in 
bunionectomy patients, there were no differences between patients treated 
with Maxigesic® IV and those treated with intravenous acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen or placebo in the rate of discontinuations due to adverse events 
(AEs), the overall incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) or the 
severity of TEAEs. The incidence of most common TEAEs (affecting ≥ 10% 
of the study population), including gastroin testinal disorders, nervous 
system disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, and 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was not significantly different 
between treatment groups. Some differences were observed between

Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 5 of 37 
treatment groups  in the incidence of specific AEs, such as vomiting and 
administration site pain, however these were attributable to the individual 
components, acetaminophen and ibuprofen respectively.  
 
All safety data obtained for Maxigesic® IV to date has come from pat ients 
exposed to single doses of the study drug (n=60) or six hourly doses for up 
to 48 hours (n=75). This study aims to determine the tolerability of repeated 
doses of Maxigesic® IV over an extended period of exposure.  
Objectives  To determine the incide nce of treatment -emergent adverse events, and 
changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory values associated with prolonged 
exposure to Maxigesic® IV  
Study Design  Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, single arm, multiple dose study to evaluate 
the safety o f Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + ibuprofen 3 mg/ml

Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 11 of 37 
1 INTRODUCTION  
This protocol describes a Phase 3 safety study designed to examine the safety of a combination of intravenous 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Maxigesic® IV). 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
Multimod al analgesia with a variety of analgesics (systemic pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_406468], regional 
and neuraxial anesthetics) is strongly recommended for the treatment of postoperative pain (1). In terms of 
systemic treatments, nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_406469]/or nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) generally form the basis of treatment, in conjunction with opi[INVESTIGATOR_406470]. 
Combined treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen has been shown to provide superior analgesia over 
administration of comparable  doses of either component alone or placebo, when administered as an intravenous 
formulation or as a solid oral tablet in the postoperative setting.  
AFT Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has sponsored several Phase 2/[ADDRESS_512506] demonstrated that Maxigesic® 
tablets (acetaminophen 500 mg + ibuprofen 150 mg, 2 tablets per dose) and Combogesic® tablets 
(acetaminophen 325 mg + ibuprofen 97.5 mg, 3 tablets per dose) provide superior pain following third molar 
removal or arthroscopic knee surgery than either drug al one or placebo (2–4).   
1.2 DRUG NAME  
[CONTACT_406492]®/Combogesic® to patients who may not be able to take oral 
analgesics, due to patient intubation, sedation, postoperative nausea and vomiting and reduced gastric motility, 
AFT Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ha s developed a fixed -dose combination containing  acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + 
ibuprofen 3 mg/ml in 100 ml solution for infusion (Maxigesic® IV). Maxigesic® IV is intended for the relief 
of mild to moderate pain and the reduction of fever, when administration by  [CONTACT_406477]/or when other routes of administration are not 
possible.  
1.2.1 Clinical Studies  
Maxigesic® IV has been evaluated in two Phase [ADDRESS_512507] study, AFT -MXIV -01, was a single -dose, open -label, 5 -period crossover pharmacokinetic study in 
30 healthy volunteers. This study found that pharmacokinetic parameters for acetaminophen and ibuprofen 
were very similar for the combination and monotherapy intravenous preparations; ratios of C max, AUC t, and 
AUC 0-∞ values fell within the 80 -125% acceptable bioequivalence range. Precise dose proport ionality for both 
compounds was also determined for the half dose of the intravenous formulation compared with the full dose. 
The relative bioavailability of acetaminophen (93.78%) and ibuprofen (96.45%) confirmed the 
pharmacokinetic equivalence between th e oral (Maxigesic®) and intravenous formulations of the fixed dose 
combination (5). 
A second pharmacokinetic study, AFT -MXIV -06, was conducted to compare Maxigesic® IV with brands of 
Confidential -Proprietary Information    
 
Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug [ADDRESS_512508] been approved in the [LOCATION_002], as well as 
Combogesic® tablets (acetaminophen 325 mg + ibuprofen 97.5 mg, 3 tablets per dose). The study was a single -
dose, open -label, 4 -period crossover pharmacokinetic study in 30 healthy volunteers. Similar to AFT -MXIV -
01, ratios of C max, AUC t, and AUC 0-∞ for Max igesic® IV to OfirmevTM and CaldolorTM fell within the 80 -125% 
acceptable bioequivalence range. The relative bioavailability of acetaminophen (83%) and ibuprofen (85%) 
re-confirmed the pharmacokinetic equivalence between the oral (Combogesic®) and intraven ous formulations.  
A Phase [ADDRESS_512509] of Maxigesic® IV in [ADDRESS_512510] metatarsal bunionectomy 
(6). Patients were treated with six hourly doses of Maxigesic® IV, acetaminophen IV (1000 mg), ibuprofen IV 
(300 mg) or placebo for 48 hours. The study found that Maxigesic® IV provided superior pain relief to  
comparable doses of either monocomponent or placebo and reduced the requirement for opi[INVESTIGATOR_57286].  
Importantly, the superior efficacy of the combination does not appear to come at the expense of tolerability. In 
the Phase 3 study of Maxigesic® IV in bunionectomy patients, there were no differences between patients 
treated with Maxigesic® IV and those treated with acetaminophen IV, ibuprofen IV or placebo in the rate of 
discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs), the overall incidence of treatm ent-emergent AEs (TEAEs) or 
the severity of TEAEs. The incidence of most common TEAEs (affecting ≥ 10% of the study population), 
including gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, general disorders and administration site 
conditions, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was not significantly different between treatment 
groups. Some differences were observed between treatment groups in the incidence of specific AEs, such as 
vomiting and administration site pain, however these were attribut able to  the individual components, 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen respectively.  
All safety data obtained for Maxigesic® IV to date has come from patients exposed to single doses of the study 
drug (n=60) or six hourly doses for up to 48 hours (n=75). The pres ent study aims to determine the tolerability 
of repeated doses of Maxigesic® IV over an extended period of exposure in a larger population.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_512511] indicated that there is no change in the safety profile of either drug when administered 
as a fixed -dose combination. The potential benefit of this study lies in its poten tial to provide superior analgesia 
to participants requiring acute pain relief following surgery.

2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
2.1 STUDY HYPOTHESIS  
The study hypothesis is that Maxigesic® IV (intravenous acetaminophen 1000 mg + intravenous ibuprofen 300 
mg/ 100 ml solution for infusion) is well tolerated over a treatment period of 5 days, and that the safety profile 
does not markedly change with extended exposure of 5 days.  
2.2 OBEJECTIVES AND  ENDPOINTS  
2.2.1 Primary Objective and Endpoint  
The primary objective is to summarize  the safety profile of Maxigesic® IV in patients exposed for ≥ 48 hours.  
The primary endpoint is the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events  associated with exposure to 
Maxigesic® IV.  
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives and Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed:  
- The time course of treatment -emergent adverse events  
- Treatment -related adverse events  
- Treatment -emergent adverse events of interest (cardiovascular, gast rointestinal, renal, hepatic , 
administration site conditions and bleeding -related events)  
- Changes in vital sign measurements  
- Changes in clinical laboratory values  
- Patient’s global evaluation of the study drug  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, single arm, multiple dose study to evaluate the safety of 
Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/mL + ibuprofen 3 mg/mL in 100 mL solution for infusion). A flow 
chart providing a schematic rep resentation of the study design is provided in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Schematic of Trial Design  
 
The study drug, Maxigesic® IV (acetaminophen 10 mg/ml + ibuprofen 3 mg/ml in 100 ml solution for 
infusion), will be administered by [CONTACT_406475] a dedicated indwelling venous cannula, infused over 15 
minutes. The study drug will be administered every 6 hours (q6h) for a  minimum of 48 hours (8 doses), with 
some patients treated for at least 5 days (≥ 20 doses).  
The study is open -label and single arm. All eligible participants will be assigned to the same study drug, and 
all patients and study staff will know the treatment being administered.  
3.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN  
The study is designed to investigate the saf ety and tolerability of Maxigesic® IV in a larger study population 
over an extended period of time. As Maxigesic® IV may be used for longer than 48 hours in clinical practice, 
the study aims to determine if prolonged exposure to Maxigesic® IV results in an y changes to the safety profile.  
The study is designed as a descriptive investigation of the safety profile of Maxigesic® IV in a larger sample 
size than has previously been evaluated. The study aims is to determine  the safety profile and the temporal 
nature of the safety profile after extended  exposure to Maxigesic® IV for ≥ 48 hours.

7.3 FOLLOW -UP 
A follow -up visit will be conducted 7  ± [ADDRESS_512529] dose of study drug. At this follow -up, any additional 
adverse event and concomitant medication data will be collected. Additionally, a physical examination 
including an assessment of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be 
conducted.  
[ADDRESS_512530] otherwise been explained. The Investigators 
will provide or arrange appropriate supportive care for the participan t if necessary.  
Adverse events common to acetaminophen and ibuprofen are listed in Appendix 2.  
8.1 DEFINITIONS  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is defined as any unintended, unfavorable clinical sign or symptom, any new illness or 
disease or deterioration of existing illness or disease, or any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory 
variables (e.g., hematological, biochemical, hormon al) or other clinical tests (e.g., ECG), whether or not 
considered treatment related.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) are defined as event s that emerge during treatment , having been 
absent pre -treatment, or that worsen relative to the pre -treatme nt status (ICH E9) . 
Treatment -emergent adverse events that are considered by [CONTACT_63033]  “probably” or “definitely” are 
treatment -related adverse events  (TRAEs).  
Note that the definition could include accidents and the reasons for changes in med icine (drug and/or dose), 
medical, nursing and/or pharmacy consultation, and admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22928].  
Normal postoperative sequelae, including pain, itching, bruising, numbness, bleeding, burning, tingling, and 
edema at the surgical si te, will not be recorded as AEs unless they are of greater severity and/or intensity than 
would be expected in the surgeon/Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations for an illness or disease which existed before the dru g 
was given or the participant was enrolled in the clinical study will not be considered adverse events.  
The severity of an adverse event and the relationship to study medication will be assessed by [CONTACT_737] 
(see Appendix 1).  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an AE (at any dose of study drug) that:  
- results in death;  
- is life -threatening (i.e., the participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; this does not include an even t that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
Confidential -Proprietary Information    
 
Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug [ADDRESS_512531] caused death);  
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
- requires in -participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908];  
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
- is another me dically significant event that, on the basis of appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g. allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse).  
An adverse event fulfilling any one or more of these criteria must be reported as a serious adver se event. The 
circumstances surrounding the occurrence of the event must be gathered, however the event itself must be 
reported, irrespective of the circumstances.  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe adverse events. Severity is an esti mate or measure 
of the intensity of an adverse event, while the criteria for serious are indications of adverse participant 
outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe adverse event need not necessarily be considered serious 
and a serious adverse event need not be considered severe. For example, nausea that persists for several hours 
may be considered severe nausea, but not a serious adverse event. On the other hand, a myocardial infarction 
that may be considered minor could also be a serious adver se event if it prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], for example.  
8.2 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING PERIOD  
Adverse event data will be collected from the time of enrollment through to the follow -up visit , 7 ± [ADDRESS_512532] dose.  
8.3 PROCEDURE FOR ADVERS E EVENT REPORTING  
All adverse events (non -serious and serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to 
an open question from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded. All adverse events (non -serious and serious) must be recorded on the 
source documents and case report forms provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
8.[ADDRESS_512533] complete a Serious Adverse Event Report (SAER) for each serious adverse event 
regardless of causality to study drug. The SAER must be faxed to the D rug Safety Officer at AFT 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd (+64 9  488 0234) within [ADDRESS_512534] igator should provide any additional follow -up information regarding the event to AFT

Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 25 of 37 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd as soon as it becomes available and up to the point the event has been resolved. This 
reporting requirement is applicable to serious adverse events th at occur during the designated study period. If 
the Investigator is notified of a serious event after the study period that he or she determines to be causally 
related to study medication, the event should also be reported through this process.  
8.4.2 Reporting t o Local Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
All adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting shall be compliant to applicable local IRB/IEC requirements. The 
Sponsor shall take the responsibility to continually monitor the safety of its clinical develop ment program and 
advise local ethics committee in a prompt manner if the updated safety information impacts the continued 
ethical acceptability of the trial which indicates the need for a change in the trial protocol or participant 
information statement.  
8.4.3 Reporting to Regulatory Agencies  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fatal or Life -Threatening Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An ADR is considered “fatal or life threatening” if, in the review of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the participants at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or adverse 
drug reaction that, had it occurred  in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Fatal or life -threatening, unexpected ADRs occurring in clinical investigations is subject to expedited 
reporting. Regulatory agencies should be notified (e.g., by [CONTACT_756], facsimile transmission, or in w riting) as 
soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_512535] include an 
assessment of the importan ce and implication of the findings, including relevant previous experience with the 
same or similar medicinal products (CPMP/ICH/377/95).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  All Other Serious, Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  
Serious, unexpected ADRs that are not fatal or life -threatening m ust be filed as soon as possible but no later 
than [ADDRESS_512536] knowledge by [CONTACT_406480] (CPMP/ICH/377/95).  
It is recommended to use the CIOMS form, which contains the informa tion as listed in the attachment [ADDRESS_512537] to expedited reporting shall be summarized in a periodic safety reporting 
according to applicable local regulatory requirements ( e.g. Medsafe 6 month’s progress report / US FDA IND 
annual report) . 
8.[ADDRESS_512538] reviews are planned for this study.

situations in which the protection, safety, and well -being of the participant requires immediate intervention, 
based on the judgment of the Investigator (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional designa ted by 
[CONTACT_737]). In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or 
mistake, the Investigator or designee must contact [CONTACT_1034], or the Sponsor’s agent, at the earliest possible 
time by [CONTACT_756]. This w ill allow an early joint decision regarding the best way to proceed with the study 
(note the ITT protocol – it is expected that all consenting participants will continue to be followed up for 
adverse events). The Investigator and the Sponsor will document this decision. The Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) will be informed of all protocol changes by [CONTACT_406481]. No significant planned or deliberate deviations from the proto col 
of any type will be made without the Sponsor’s agreement and complying with all the IRB or EC established 
procedures.

APPENDIX 2: ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS OF TH E INVESTIGATIONAL PR ODUCT  
 
Known adverse drug reactions of acetaminophen alone:  
Impaired liver function or a history of liver disease:  
Acetaminophen should be administered with caution to participants with impaired hepatic function because of 
the possibility of delayed elimination or increased serum concentrations.  
 
Impaired Renal Function : 
Acetaminophen should be administered with cautio n to participants with impaired renal function because of 
the possibility of delayed elimination or increased serum concentrations.  
 
Known adverse drug reactions of Ibuprofen alone:  
Asthma:  
Caution is required if ibuprofen is administered to participants suffering from, or with a previous history of, 
bronchial asthma since ibuprofen has been reported to cause bronchospasm in such participants.  
 
Ophthalmological Monitoring:  
Adverse ophthalmological effects have been observed with NSAIDs; accord ingly, participants who develop 
visual disturbances during treatment with ibuprofen should have an ophthalmological examination.  
 
Impaired Liver Function or a History of Liver Disease:  
Participants with impaired liver function or a history of liver disease  who are on long term ibuprofen therapy 
should have hepatic function monitored at regular intervals. Ibuprofen has been reported to have a minor and 
transient effect on liver enzymes.  
Severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and cases of fatal hepatiti s, though rare, have been reported with 
ibuprofen as with other NSAIDs. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, etc.),  
ibuprofen should be discontinued.  
 
Impaired Renal Function:  
Caution should be used when initiating treatment with ibuprofen in participants with considerable dehydration.  
The two major metabolites of ibuprofen are excreted mainly in the urine and impairm ent of renal function may 
result in their accumulation. The significance of this is unknown. NSAIDs have been reported to cause 
nephrotoxicity in various forms; interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. In participants with 
renal, cardi ac or hepatic impairment, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors and the elderly, caution is 
required since the use of NSAIDs may result in deterioration of renal function. The dose should be kept as low 
as possible and renal function should be monitore d in these participants.  
 
Cardiovascular Effects:  
Fluid retention and edema have been reported in association with ibuprofen, therefore, the drug should be used 
with caution in participants with a history of heart failure or hypertension.  
 
Aseptic Meningitis:  
Aseptic meningitis has been reported only rarely, usually but not always in participants with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) or other connective tissue disorders.  
 
Hematological Monitoring:  
Blood dyscrasias have been rarely reported. Partic ipants on long -term therapy with ibuprofen should have 
regular hematological monitoring.  
 
Coagulation Defects:  
Like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen can inhibit platelet aggregation. Ibuprofen has been shown to prolong bleeding 
time (but within the normal range), i n normal participants. Because this prolonged bleeding effect may be 
Confidential -Proprietary Information    
 
Maxigesic® IV Exposure Study Protocol (AFT -MXIV -11) 
Version 3, 21st Aug 2019  Page 36 of 37 
exaggerated in participants with underlying hemostatic defects, ibuprofen should be used with caution in 
persons with intrinsic coagulation defects and those on anti -coagulation therapy.  
 
Masking Signs of Infection:  
As with other drugs of the NSAID class, ibuprofen may mask the usual signs of infection.  
 
Special Precautions:  
In order to avoid exacerbation of disease or adrenal insufficiency, participants who have been on prolonged 
corticos teroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly rather than discontinued abruptly when 
ibuprofen is added to the treatment program.

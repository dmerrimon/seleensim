I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :   
Hypothesis :  
1. Tenofovir plasma concentrations will be lower, tenofovir diphosphate 
conce ntrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be higher, and 
tenofovir di phosphate concentrations in red blood cells (measured as dried 
blood spots, DBS) will be lower with tenofovir alafenamide relative to tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate.   
2. Tenofovir  plasma and intracellular tenofovir diphosphate concentrations will 
increase whe n tenofovir alafenamide is co-adminis tered with 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir  relative to TAF alone.  
3. Markers of renal function (e.g. CrCl, urinary retinol binding protein /creat inine  
ratio and urinary beta -2 microglobulin /creatinine ratio ) will not change when  
tenofovir alafenamide is coadministered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.  
 
Primary Aims:  
1. Compare the area under the concentration time curve over the dosing interval 
(AUC0 -24) of tenof ovir in plasma when switched from tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF)  (Phase 1)  to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF  25mg ) (Phase 2) , and 
compare the AUC0 -24 of tenofovir in plasma given as TDF  (Phase 1)  to  
tenofovir in plasma in the form of TAF  25mg  concomitant ly with ledipasvir 
(LDV)/sofosbuvir (SOF)  (Phase 3)  
2. Compare TFV -DP in PBMCs betw een TDF (Phase 1)  and TAF  25mg  (Phase 
2) and between TDF (Phase 1)  and TAF  25mg  plus LDV/SOF  (Phase 3)  
 
Secondary Aims:  
1. Compare TFV -DP in DBS between TDF (Phase 1)  and TAF  25mg  (Phase 2)  
and between TDF  (Phase 1)  and TAF  25mg  plus LDV/SOF  (Phase 3)  
2. Compare  CrCl, urinary retinol binding protein /creatinine ratio , urinary beta -2 
microglobulin /creatinine ratio between TDF (Phase 1)  and TAF  25mg  (Phase 
2) and between TDF  (Phase 1)  and TAF  25mg  plus LDV/SOF  (Phase 3)  
 
 
II. Background and Significance :  
 
Hepatitis C v irus (HCV) infection is common among persons infected with HIV due to their shared 
routes of transmission. (1) On average, about 30% of individuals living with HIV are co -infected with 
HCV. HCV is associated with an increased liver -disease s-related morbidity and mortality in persons 
with HIV. (2) Thus, there is a great need to treat HCV in individuals co -infected with HIV.

CF-146, Ef fective 7/10/[ADDRESS_126674] -acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have revolutionized the treatment of HC V, but drug 
interactions remain a substantial challenge. (3, 4)   Ledipasvir (LDV) is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A 
enzyme. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5B polymerase enzyme. These drugs are 
co-formula ted in a single tablet (Harvoni®, [COMPANY_009] Sciences, Foster City, CA) for once dai ly 
administ ration. Just 12 weeks of LDV/SOF  has achieved cure rates of >95% in HCV treatment 
naïve and treatment experienced patients including in patients coinfected with HIV. (5, 6)  LDV/SOF  
is one of the preferred treatment  options  for HCV because it is highly efficacious, well tolerated, 
has a low pi[INVESTIGATOR_13551], a short treatment duration of between 8 and 24 weeks, and a low potential for  
drug interactions with antiretroviral agents. The main  concern with use of LDV/ SOF in co -infected 
patients is that LDV/SOF can raise concentrations of the HIV  drug tenofovir. Tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF) is one of the most widely prescribed antiret roviral agents. It is a well -tolerated drug, 
but its use has been shown to be as sociated with renal toxicity including declines in glomerular 
filtration rate, proximal tubular damage, and acute kidney injury. (7-9) Studies suggest the renal 
toxicities from TDF are concentration -dependent (i.e., higher tenofovir concentrations are 
associated with a greater risk for renal toxicity). (10) LDV/SOF , when given concomi tantly with TDF 
and a ritonavir -boosted protease inhibitor , has been shown to increase the tenofovi r area under the 
concentration time curve (AUCtau) in healthy volunteers  to levels that exceed the tenofovir levels 
for which there is established safety data (Figure 1) .(11) When patients on antiretroviral regim ens 
that include TDF and a booster are treated with LDV/SOF, they have a “double whammy” in terms 
of the increase in tenofovir exposures.

the combination of LDV/SOF , tenofovir  disoproxil fumarate , and a ritonavir -boosted 
protease inhibitor (eithe r ritonavir -booted atazanavir or darunavir) exceeds tenofovir 
exposures with established safety data.

There is a new formulation of tenofovir called  tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)  which provides a  lower 
risk of interactions and less renal toxicity . Because it circulates predominantly in pr o-drug form,  
TAF maintains 90% lower circulating plasma tenofovir levels compare d to TDF. (12, 13)  TAF is also 
not a substrate for renal uptake transporters. Thus , TAF is thought to have a significantly reduced 
poten tial for renal toxicities. (12, 13)  TAF is a very reasonable alternative to TDF in individuals on 
ritonavir or cobicistat who require HCV treatment with LDV/SOF , but there are currently no data 
evaluating  the pharma cokinetics and safety of the combination  of LDV/SOF, TA F and a ritonavir or 
cobicistat -boos ted protease inhibitor  when dosed as 25mg of TAF . TAF was FDA approved in two 
different strengths, 10mg which is only available co -formulated with elvitegravir, cobi cistat, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide 10mg (Genvoya®, [COMPANY_009] Sciences,  Foster City, CA) and 
25mg which is co -formulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide 25mg (Descovy®, 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Foster City, CA).  While favorable  pharmacokineti c data are available on the 
interaction between elvitegravir, cobicistat , emtric itabine and tenofovir alafenamide 10mg  with 

 
Protocol Template  Page 4 
CF-146, Ef fective 7/10/11  
 LDV/SOF in healthy volunteers (14), there  is an absence of data  with ritonavir -boosted protease 
inhibitors  and with the 25mg strength of TAF .  
 
 
There are several alternatives to LDV/SOF  for HCV treatment (e.g., sofosbuvir plus the HCV  NS5A 
inhibitor, velpatasvir  (a co mbinati on referred to  as SOF/VEL), or Zepatier ® which contains  elbasvir, 
a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor, and grazoprevir, an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor. All of 
these alternatives have drawbacks clinically. Additionally , simply avoiding the use of ritonavir or 
cobicistat  with TDF as a component of antiretroviral therapy is not possible in all patients. (15, 16)  
Thus , patients may receive the combination of LDV/SOF , tenofovir, and ritonavir or cobicistat  and 
data are desperately needed to determine the magnitude of th e interaction between tenofovir and 
LDV/SOF  and examine potential alternatives, such as TAF, that migh t be renal -sparing . The 
purpose of this study is to determine the magnitude of the interaction between tenofovir in the form 
of TAF and LDV/SOF and examine the effect of this i nteraction on renal function.  
 
Several renal biomarkers have routinely been used  in clinical research, specifically in HIV infected 
patients to determine the presence or absence of proximal tubular dysfunction.(12 -14) An increase 
in low molecular weight pr oteins such as urinary retinol binding protein and beta -[ADDRESS_126675] bee n shown to be indicative of tubular dysfunction, with the urinary concentration being 
correlated with the severity of the tubular dysfunction.(12) Early studies in HIV infected  individuals 
have shown that the presence of HIV alone increases the urinary con centrations of retinol binding 
protein and beta -2 microglobulin by 3 -10 fold when compared to healthy controls(15) and that 
patients who have tenofovir -induced Fanconi syndrome  tend to have very high levels of these 
markers.(16) Both retinol binding protei n and beta -[ADDRESS_126676] chosen to 
use these biomarke rs to study the renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide and LDV/SOF.  
 
 
Good adher ence to study medications is important in 
the context of a pharmacokinetic / drug interaction 
study . There are a variety of tools that can be used to 
assess adherence including  pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], refill histories, 
digital ingestible sensor, and  electronic monito ring. To 
monitor participants adherence in this study , we will 
use the Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_113568]  
(Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_113569], Cape Town, South Africa)  or 
directly obser ved therapy via video -streaming methods 
(e.g., FaceTime, Google Hangouts, TimeSt amp) . 
Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_113570] a cellular signal  (real-time) when 
opened to a central managemen t system (Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_113571]). The dispenser is slightly larger  than a 
cell phone and small enough to fit in a pocket. The 
battery lasts 4 months without charging . Participants 
will switch out 7-day medication cartridge  once weekly  
- which takes seconds to perform. (17) We are using this device in an ongoing study of LDV/SOF in 
HIV/HCV coinfected persons who use drugs. Directly observed therapy via v ideo-streaming 
methods ma y be used in place of the Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_113572] , approaches of which have also been us ed in 
multiple studies through the CAVP laboratory .  
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
 
Analytical approaches to be used in this research:  
Tenofovir will be quantified in  plasma using a v alidated LC -MS/MS method with a  dynamic range 
of 10ng/mL to 15 00 ng/mL. (18)  Intracellular tenofovir diphosphate (TFV -DP) will be measured in 

 
Protocol Template  Page 5 
CF-146, Ef fective 7/10/11  
 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using a valida ted LC -MS/MS method with a dynamic 
range of 2.5 fmol/sample to 2000 fmol/sample. (19) 
 
Our group is well -versed in these techniques as shown in  the following studies:  
We have been performing studies on the pharmacolo gy of tenofovir for more than 10 years, (18, 
20-25) and recently identified a drug interaction between individuals taking TDF in combination with 
SOF/ribavirin. (26)  
 
As Figure 2 indicates, TFV -DP was increased 4 -fold in dried blood spots (DBS) after 12 weeks of 
SOF and ribavirin (RBV) treatment. This interaction was also observed in peripher al blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC), where TFV -DP concentrations at week 12 of SOF/RBV treatment were 
double those observed before (study entry) 
and 12 weeks following the comple tion of 
SOF/RBV treatment. (26) 
 
Clinical Consid erations:  
We have established collaborat ions with 
study co -investigator  [CONTACT_113599]  who care s for HIV -positive patients 
in the Infectious Disease Group Practice 
(IDGP) Clinic at the University of Colorado 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. [CONTACT_113600] -Mancilla rece ntly

D. Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection Tools:  
 
Description of risks:  
We are collecting blood, urine, genetic,  and clinical information from participants through this study  
as well as switch ing their HIV regimen from TDF to TAF  25mg  and using LDV/SOF in  HCV 
seronegative individuals . The potential risks associated with study participation are and are 
outlined below :  
1) Blood will be collected from an arm vein. Risks of blood draws include pain w hen the 
needle or lancet pi[INVESTIGATOR_113586], bruising, and/or infection. We are coll ecting 24  mL of 
blood at each of the abbreviated pharmaco kinetic visits for a total of 72  mL o f blood. The 
blood volumes are well below the maximal volumes set for blood dona tions and clinical 
research of 450 to 550 mL in 8 weeks.  
2) Privacy risk: As with participation in any clinical trial, privacy cannot be guaranteed. This 
study will collect clini cal information from patients with HIV infection. The video DOT 
methods may also  pose a risk as video sessions may not be encrypted and could be 
decoded and viewed by [CONTACT_26404], in addition to telephone numbers.  
3) Switching from TDF to TAF  25mg . The risk s of switching therapy are minimal due  to TAF  
25mg  having lower renal adverse ev ents. The risk include potential virologic failure (e.g. 
increases in the HIV -1 RNA) or potential adverse reaction to TAF  25mg  that was not 
experienced with TDF including:  hype rsensitivity, gastrointestinal issues or renal failure.  
4) Renal toxicity  and adver se events  with TDF or TAF  25mg . TDF specifically has been 
shown to cause renal toxicity including declines in glom erular filtration rate, proximal 
tubular damage, and acute kid ney injury. The FDA labeling information for TDF and TAF  
25mg  list this as a pot ential risk. Other adverse events from TDF or TAF include: nausea  
(13%) , diarrhea  (21%) , fatigue  (14%) , and increase in total cholesterol  (> 10%) .  
5) There are risks associated w ith Hepatitis C treatment  in an HCV seronegative individual . 
These  includ e devel opment of virologic resistance  if participants were to become infected 
while taking the medication. This could  make future Hepatitis C therapi[INVESTIGATOR_113587].  
6) The risks of ta king ledipasvir/sofosbuvir include adverse events of the medication such as: 
fatigue (13-18%) , headache  (11-17%) , nausea  (6-9%), diarrhea  (3-7%), trouble  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
(3-6%) and bilirubin elevations  (less than 3%) .  
7) Pregnancy. The risk of taking ledipasvir/sof osbuvir, TDF and TAF  25mg  while pregnant are 
unknown, thus measures will be take n to not enroll pregnant women and also educate 
subjects on the importance of not becoming pregnant while on study.  
8) Genetic information. This study will collect DNA samples to explore relationships between 
genetic variability in enzymes and transporters th at may affect the pharmacokinetics of the 
study drugs being examined in the study. There is a risk that a third party could access this 
information and use it to discriminate a gainst subjects.  
 
Minimizing risks :  
1) Blood draws will be performed by [CONTACT_113594].  
2) Informed Consent: The study will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_113595]. Written documentation of informed consen t approval will be present prior to 
initiation of any study related procedures. A consent form will be provided to participants in 
the clinic. Ample time will be allotted for the consenting process, which will take place in a 
private room. Subjects will be  encouraged to ask questions and take as much time as 
needed to reach a decision . Subjects will be given a copy of the signed consent document.  
3) Participants will be assigned a unique study identification number (SID). This number will 
be used on case repo rt forms and samples rather than patient identifiers. The link between 
the SID a nd patient name [CONTACT_113598] (consent form, demographic form, W9, etc.) 
with identifying information will be stored in a locked cabinet in [CONTACT_113601]’s locked office in 
the Skaggs School of Pharmacy building room 4102.  
 
Protocol Template  Page 12 
CF-146, Ef fective 7/10/11  
 4) Video DOT: every effort will be made to protect subjects’ information. Videos will be viewed 
on a password -protected phone, and only the participant’s SID will be programmed into the 
phone. Live -streamed vide os will be observed in a private location, and any recorded 
videos sent via text  will be erased following appropriate documentation of the date and 
time of drug ingestion.  
5) Participants will be managed by [CONTACT_113596]  
25mg . 
6) For patients taking either TDF or TAF  25mg  with a ritonavir or cobicistat -boosted protease 
inhibitor, urine parame ters will be assessed every 4 weeks and  the tenofovir dose altered 
as indicat ed for reductions in renal function. Indiv iduals at higher risk for renal toxicity 
(glom erular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are excluded from study. Subjects will also 
be discontinued if glom erular filtration r ate declines to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. We 
will also follow the Division of  AIDS toxicity tables and Grade 3 or higher for Scr (> 1.8 to 
<3.[ADDRESS_126687] OR Increase of 1.5 to < 2.0 x above baseline) and CrCl (<60 to 30 ml/min or 
ml/min/1.73 m2 OR > 30 to <  50% decrease from baseline) will be reported to Dr . Castillo -
Mancilla within [ADDRESS_126688] of care.   
7) Subjects will be counseled on the importance of reducing the risk of acqu iring HCV while 
enrolled in the study (i.e., safe sex practices, use of clean ne edles, etc.).  The importance of 
adherence to Hepatitis C treatment will be stressed to participants to minimize the risk of 
develop ing viral resistance.  Adherence will also be monitored using the Wisepi[INVESTIGATOR_113572].  
8) Adverse events will be monitored as below (Toxicity Management section)   
9) Pregnant women will be excluded from the  study and pregnancy tests will be done at 
screening as well as Visits 2  and 3.  
10) Genetic information: th e subject will be asked for explicit consent within the ICF to collect a 
genetic  sample, and may request for their sample to be withdrawn and destroyed after 
collection. Collected genetic samples will be de -identified and labeled with the subject’s 
SID. Ge netic analyses with the subject’s sample will not be included in the patient’s 
medical record and will be kept either in a locked file cabinet or secured server that is only 
available to study personnel.  
 
Toxicity Management  
 
This study is collecting blo od and clinical information. Any side effects observed in the course of 
the stud y will be  reported to Dr . Castill o-Mancilla , and managed as per standard of care  and the 
toxicity management plan described below:   
 
1. Assessing adverse events. Each subject will  be evaluated for clinical and laboratory 
adverse events at each study visit. Dr . Kiser and her study staff will review laboratory 
results daily, and our University hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113588]. All adverse events will be 
graded using the DAIDS tables.  The chronicity of the event will be documented as: single 
occurrence, intermittent, or persistent. The date of adverse event onset, cessation, and 
report will also be document ed. The relationship to study medication(s) will be documented 
as yes, no, or ca nnot be ruled out. The action taken will be documented as well (e.g., none, 
study drugs held, study drugs discontinued, additional laboratory tests required, and/or 
medications  prescribed to manage the adverse effects).  
2. Adverse event attribution scale. All serious adverse events will be graded as to their 
expectedness and their outcome (i.e., not -related, possibly -related, probably -related, or 
definitely -related to the study pro tocol).  
3. Reporting adverse events. Any grade [ADDRESS_126689] . Castillo -Mancilla within 24 hours of the event. 
Adverse events grades ≤[ADDRESS_126690] or medical  
 
Protocol Template  Page 13 
CF-146, Ef fective 7/10/[ADDRESS_126691] that is (1) unexpected and related to study drug or study  
treatmen t or (2) required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113589], caused disability,  
death, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or was considered life -threatening will be  
documented and reported immediately to the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review  Board, 
the University of Colorado Clinical Translational Res earch Center, and [COMPANY_009]  Sciences.  
 
Individual study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_113590] , blood 
draws  and providing LDV/SOF to individuals without HCV infection . Thus, side ef fect management 
is at the discretion of the infectious disease provider (e.g. Dr . Castillo -Mancilla ). The following 
criteria have been developed to indicate when an individual subject would need to d iscontinue 
study medications and study participation.  
1. Individual Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_113591]:  
a. Non-adherence with study activities at the discretion of the Investigator   
b. Pregnancy  
c. Decrease of glomerular filtration rate by ≥50%, if glomerular f iltration rate is ≤ 60 
mL/min/1.73m2 at time of enrollmen t 
d. Adverse event for which study team deems HCV treatment or study participation to 
no longer be in subject’s best interests  
e. Threatening to clinic or study personnel  
 
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121].   
The rate of serious adverse events in the Phase 3 LDV/SOF trials  was 4 -6% and in TAF was 3 -4%. 
If greater than 10% or 2  patients in a row (whichever is smaller) experience a serious adverse 
event deem ed possibly or  probably related to LDV/SOF, TAF 25mg treatmen t or study 
participation, the study will be stopped and the  study team will review all safety and laboratory data 
and consider making changes to the study vs. discontinuing the study permanently.  
 
    
E. Potential Scientific Problems:   
We would like complete data for [ADDRESS_126692] the as sistance of other local HIV providers/clinics (e.g., Denver 
Health, Apex family medicine, Kaiser, Rose Medical Center).  
 
F. Data Analysis Plan:   
 
Analysis Plan . For the primary analysis, Phase [ADDRESS_126693] (tenofovir in plasma and TFV -DP in PBMCs), the 
primary comparisons will be performed using a significance lev el of 0.025. We will enroll [ADDRESS_126694] differences in outcom es between phases.  R (http://www.r -
project.org/), GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) and SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC) 
software will be used for analysis. All power calculations were performed in PASS, NCSS 
software, Kaysville UT.  
 
AIM-1.  AIM -1 is to comp are the AUC levels of tenofovir in plasma between Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 and between Phase 1 and Phase 3. Sample size parameters for Phase 1 were 
estimated from AUC 0-24 levels of tenofovir in plasma from patients on a TDF + 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir regimen for a m inimum of 4 weeks on study . (25) For these 15 
participants, a geometric mean of 4108 ng*hr/mL w as observed with a corresponding log e 
transformed mean (SD) = 8.321 (0.320) used for sample size calculations.  
 
 
Protocol Template  Page 14 
CF-146, Ef fective 7/10/11  
 Aim-1 Power: Phase [ADDRESS_126695] 90% lower AUC 0-24 levels of tenofovir compared to Ph ase 1. (12, 13)  Conservatively 
doubling the standard deviation from Phase [ADDRESS_126696] a 90% decrease in AUC 0-[ADDRESS_126697] assuming that the actual distribution is normal. Powering 
off a lower than expected decrease  in AUC 0-24 levels, a sample size of 10 achieves ≥ 80% 
power to detect a 50% decrease in AUC 0-[ADDRESS_126698] above.  
 
Aim-1 Power: Phase [ADDRESS_126699] been on 12 weeks 
of F/TAF  25mg  + a ritonavir or cobicistat  boosted protease inhibitor (Phase 2) will continue 
on this regimen while LDV/SOF treat ment is added. From Phase [ADDRESS_126700] a 
27% increase in AUC 0-24 levels of tenofovir compared to Phase 2. This results in an overall 
expected decrease in AUC 0-24 levels from Phase 1 to Phase 3 of 87% (90% decrease x 
27% increase). With a sample size of 10, a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_126701] an 87% 
decrease in AUC 0-[ADDRESS_126702] above but powering off a 
lower than expected decrease, a sample size of 10 achieves ≥80%  power to detect a 49% 
decrease in AUC 0-24 levels from Phase 1 to Phase 3.  
 
AIM-2.  AIM -2 is to compare the TFV -DP in PBMCs between Phase 1 and Phase 2 and 
between Phase 1 and Phase 3. Sample size parameters for TFV -DP in PBMCs for Phase 
1 were estimat ed from 11 subjects on TDF with a ritonavir -containing antiretroviral regimen 
from Cohort 1 of ACTG 5327. For these individuals, a geometric mean of 74 fmol/million 
cells was observed with corresponding log e transformed mean (SD) = 4.305 (0.529) used 
for sample size calculations.  
 
Aim-2 Power: Phase  1 to Phase 2.  Preliminary data for 10 individuals on a TAF  25mg  with 
cobicistat regimen was used to estimate levels of TFV -DP in PBMCs for Phase 2. (27) The 
geometric mean for these individuals was 517 fmol/million cells resulting in a difference in 
TFV-DP between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of 1.94 (0.637) on the log e scale, where the 
estimated standard deviati on conservatively assumes no correlation of subjects between 
phases. Assuming a two -sided Wilcoxon test with a sample size of [ADDRESS_126703] greater than 99% power when the standard deviation is doubled in the power 
calculation.  
 
Aim-2 Power: Phase 1 to Phase 3.  In Phase 3, LDV/ SOF treatment is added to patients 
taking F/TAF 25mg  + a ritonavir or cobicistat  boosted protease inhibitor . Data on the 
interaction between F/TAF 25mg and cobicistat with LDV/SOF shows an increase in TFV -
DP in PBMCs in healthy volunteer s.(14) As we are ≥99% powered under conservative 
estimates from phase [ADDRESS_126704] to be  fully powered from Phase 1 to Phase 
3 due to the larger detectable difference resulting from the addition of LDV/SOF.  
 
Secondary Objectives.  Secondary analyses include: 1) c ompare TFV -DP in DBS 
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 and between Phase 1 and Phase 3; 2) compare CrCL, 
urinary retinol binding protein /creat ratio , urinary beta -2 microglobulin  urine per ratio CRT  
between Phases 1 and 2 and between Phases 1 and 3; 3) compare A UC 0-24 of tenofovir in 
plasma between Phase 2 and Phase 3; and 4) compare TFV -DP in PBMCs between 
Phase 2 and Phase 3. Friedman’s test and non -parametric methods will be employed. As 
secondary objectives are considered hypothesis generating, p -values will be reported 
unadjusted for multiple comparisons.  The percentage of patients achiev ing SVR will be 
provided.

G. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
LDV/SOF  is the preferred treatment for HCV because it is highly efficacious,   well 
tolerated, has a low pi[INVESTIGATOR_113592], and a short treatment duration of between 8 and 24 weeks. 
It is a highly desirable treatment option for HIV infected individuals because of its low 
potential for drug interactions with antiretroviral agents. However, the increase in tenofovir 
expo sures observed in drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers is a significant 
concern and there is minimal guidance on the appropriate management of patients on 
tenofovir -based antiretroviral therapy initiating LDV/SOF . Through this study , we will 
determine the magnitude of the interaction between tenofovir administered in the form of 
TAF 25mg  and LDV/SOF  in HIV  monoinfected  patients and examine the effect of this 
interaction on renal function.

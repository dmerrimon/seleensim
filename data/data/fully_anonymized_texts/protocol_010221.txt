Acute and Chronic pain of the C ommon Extensor Tendon (CET) regi on, or lateral 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_32202]/lateral epi[INVESTIGATOR_360838], or tennis elbow is a comm on pathology of both 
athletes and non-athletes affecting 1 to 3 % of the population at large.1,2The 
prevalence of chronic problems c aused by [CONTACT_464367] 40%.[ADDRESS_595047] recreation time, decreased quality of life, an d work-related disability 
claims. As an example, medial and lateral epi[INVESTIGATOR_464342] 11.7% of 
work-related injury claims in Wa shington State from [ADDRESS_595048] workers’ compensation cost of $6,[ADDRESS_595049] authors t o now refer to this 
condition as an Epi[INVESTIGATOR_464343], abandoning the mislabelled “itis”.3–5
Diagnostic Ultrasound has been used to evaluate musculoskeletal  anatomy and 
pathology since the early 1990’s. Ultrasound imaging can be used to evaluate the 
structure of the Common Extensor tendons, evidence of microtear s, partial and full 
ruptures, and hypoechoic lesions  in and about the tendon and pe ritendinous lesions9.
Common Extensor Tendon thickness can change with age10, and should be a useful 
tool in tracking tendon improvement during a long treatment per iod.
Conservative treatment of the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_464344]. This strategy includes identification  and correction of 
possible etiological factors, and a symptom Ǧrelated approach. Generally, the initial 
treatment consists of a multifactorial approach that may includ e a combination of rest 
(complete or modified activity), medication (NSAIDs for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_232089]), stretching and 
strength training9.
Intense Therapeutic Ultrasound (ITU) is a novel potential treat ment for CET 
Tendinosis. ITU is a highly focused ultrasound wave that delive rs enough energy 
intensity to disrupt soft tissues within a controlled up to [ADDRESS_595050] been performed with this technolog y.  Clinical 
studies in 2005/2006 (IRB#’s 05 -06-032, 1253-014) using intense therapeutic 
ultrasound (ITU) on facial soft t issue whereby [CONTACT_464368] (~1 mm3) were 
performed. Seventy subjects were involved in the studies and 84 % of subjects 
showed an improvement in facial lifting with no significant pai n, erythema, 
GUIDED THERAPY SYSTEMS, CONFIDENTIAL 
Page [ADDRESS_595051] was to 
determine if ITU accelerates the healing process, and/or promot e s  a  r e s p o n s e  
that leads to superior structural and mechanical properties of tendon.  Preliminary 
results from the rabbit research at day [ADDRESS_595052] treatment  showed an increase in 
Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor A (VEGFa), Tumor Necros is Factor 
Alpha (TNF α), Interleukin 1 -Beta (IL- 1β), and Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 
(TGFβ1) and a decrease in Collagen Type 1 Alpha 1(COL1 α1), and  Collagen 
Type 1 Alpha 2(COL1 α2) in the damaged and ITU treated legs .  
 
At [ADDRESS_595053] treatment PCR showed an increase in Collagen Ty pe 1 Alpha 1 
(COL1a1) and Collagen Type 1 Alpha 2 (COL 1a2), as well as an i ncrease in 
Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor A (VEGFa), Tumor Necros is Factor 
Alpha (TNF α), Interleukin 1 -Beta (IL- 1β), and Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 
(TGFβ1), in the injured rabbit tendon treated with ITU compared to injured, 
untreated rabbit tendon15.  These results led us to explore the possibility of 
performing a clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of ITU in actual patients with 
CET Tendinosis.  The purpose of this trial is evaluate the tolerability and effi cacy of an ITU device to 
treat CET tendinosis as measured by [CONTACT_464369]-assessment sur vey of pain

ULTRASOUND THERAPY BACKGROUND  
 
i. Historical Background  
 
Ultrasound is an energy modality  that can propagate to deeper l ayers of tissue 
while sparing the skin surface. The energy created from intense  focused 
ultrasound (ITU) can be focused into deep tissue layers to achi eve controlled 
coagulative necrosis ( ≤ 1 mm3).  
 
ii. Previous Ultrasound Research  
 
Ulthera® Studies 
 
Clinical studies in 2005/2006 (IRB#’s 05 -06-032, 1253-014) using intense 
therapeutic ultrasound (ITU) on facial soft tissue whereby [CONTACT_464370] 
(~1 mm3) were performed. Seventy subjects were involved in the studies  and 
84% of subjects showed an improvement in facial lifting with no  significant 
pain, erythema, inflammation, or scarring10,11.  
 
In addition, more than 300,[ADDRESS_595054] been tre ated with the 
Ulthera device with no reportable adverse events.

Page 6 of 35         Protocol V11 May 1, 2015 
  
For these clinical studies, highly focused sources were used at  4 . 4  a n d  7 . 5  
MHz, at source power levels of 20 – 60 W. This sharply focused intense field 
was capable of achieving selective coagulative necrosis in sub- epi[INVESTIGATOR_464345]. 
 
The Ulthera device has received FDA clearance for non-invasive lifting of the 
eyebrow, neck and submenta l regions (K121700).   
 Pre-clinical 
 
Therapeutic application of ultra sound energy in skin tissue, ha s been 
extensively investigated by [CONTACT_27156]
10-13. The selective thermal coagulation of 
skin tissue with directive ultrasound energy was demonstrated in vitro as well 
as in vivo . In order to comprehensively understand the ultrasound energy- skin 
tissue interaction, a wide range of ultrasound source geometrie s and source 
conditions were investigated during the pre-clinical research. The source 
frequencies investigated ranged from 4 – 10 MHz, whereby [CONTACT_464371] 5 – 80 W.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS 
Assessment of Efficacy 
Primary: 
 The primary endpoint(s) for efficacy and tolerability will be t he total score of the 
PRTEE questionnaire (Appendix 2) , subject self-assessment of im provement and 
satisfaction (SROM-Appendix 3-B) , and Visual Analog Scale for P ain (VAS) or Universal 
Pain Assessment Tool (Appendix 3-C).  
 
Secondary: The secondary endpoint for efficacy will be a measured reductio n in tendon thickness by 
[CONTACT_464376], and a physical examination. 
 
 
PRTEE Questionnaire 
 
The PRTEE questionnaire (Appendix 2) evaluates three domains clinically relevant to 
patients (pain, functi on, and activity) and was specifically de veloped to assess the clinical 
severity of CET tendinopathy.  It is composed of 15 questions t hat cover 3 domains of pain 
(questions 1 through 5), function for specific activities (ques tions 6 through 11), and general 
activities (questions 12 through 15).  All questions are scored  0 – 10. Higher scores indicate 
more severe CET tendinopathy.  The PRTEE questionnaire has been  validated and shows 
good test-retest reliability18  
 
 
Physical Examination  
 
 
Medical History: Review patient’s medical history questionnaire . Review any diagnostic 
imaging, tests, or work up listed under longitudinal medical re cord and centricity. Ask 
about possible trauma or history of injuries to the symptomatic  arm. Review athletic 
history (tennis, golf, etc) and subject’s pre -study exercise regimen (if any). Height, Weight 
(BMI) will also be documented.

Images will be preserved with the following notations: 
 
x Protocol ID 
x Right vs. Left CET Tendon 
x Treated vs. Untreated 
 
Long Axis and Short Axis (if necessary) images will be stored at the Sonographer’s 
discretion, to demonstrate and track the applicable anatomy/pat hology in the peri-CET area. 
 
Sonographer will also measure the thickness of the CET tendon i n each applicable image. 
 
Sonographer will scan the contralateral CET tendon in the same manner noting the change 
in the tendon (Right v. Left) and (Treated v. Untreated).

Outcome measures 
Subjects  will complete subject reported outcome measures at 0,  2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks 
and will undergo a focused physi cal examination and diagnostic ultrasound at 0, 2, 4, and 8  
weeks. Adverse event s will be rec orded at each visit.  Treatmen t tolerability will be assessed 
immediately after each treatment  using the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS) or Universal 
Pain Assessment Tool (Appendix 3-B). The VAS will be used for 2 different assessments: 1. 
Pain related to physical activity of the sy mptomatic arm before treatments and at follow -up 
visits and phone surveys. 2. Pain tolerance of the therapy treatment. Each of these 
assessments will be documented  and evaluated separately.   
 
 
Aim 1: reported outcomes 
The principal aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of treatment and time course of 
response to treatment using validated subjec t reported outcome measures assessing pain, 
function and level of activity. Subjects will complete validated subject reported outcome 
questionnaires assessing pain, f unction and level of activity p rior to initiating treatment and at 

GUIDED THERAPY SYSTEMS, CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 16 of 35         Protocol V11 May 1, 2015 
 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after starting treatment (Appendix  2 and 3A).   
 
Clinical Pain and Treatment Tolerance  will be assessed using the Visual Analog Scale for 
Pain (VAS) or Universal Pain Asse ssment Tool (Appendix 3-B).  
 
Function  will be assessed using three validated response forms: PRTEE - An index of the 
severity of CET Tendinopathy18 (Appendix 2), Self -Reported Outcome Measures (SROM)16. 
 
Level of Activity  will be assessed using the activity subscale of PRTEE18 (Appendix 2). This 
subscale scores quantitatively the level of diff iculty subjects face when they perform basic 
activities of daily living. It has shown to be an  accurate and reliable predictor of the activity 
level while performing day -to-day activities.  
 
Statistical analysis  
Data will be assessed for variance homogeneity and normality. PRTEE18, and Visual Analog 
Scale for Pain (VAS) or Universa l Pain Assessment Tool (Appendi x 3-B) scores will be 
assessed before and after intervention. The VAS will be used for 2 different assessments: 1. 
Pain related to physical activity of the sympto matic arm before and after treatment. 2. Pain 
tolerance of the therapy treatment. Each of  these assessments will  be documented and 
evaluated separately.   
 
Aim 2: CET Tendon thickness 
Diagnostic ultrasound imaging will be perfor med with an FDA approved ultrasound scanner 
(Spark® System, Ardent Sound, Inc. – Mesa, AZ, see Appendix 7 -B using a coupling gel 
(Polysonic®, or AquaSonic®, Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, see Appendix 7 -C) by a 
trained sonographer or physician. Subjects will be treated seated with their arm resting on a 
structure that is comfortable for the subject and technologist.    
CET Tendon thickness is measured before treatment(s) and at each documented 
assessment (Appendix 1). Paired t tests are used to compare the CET Tendon thickness 
means between pre - and post -treatment between the symptoma tic and treated arm and the 
asymptomatic and untreated arm. P<0.05 is cons idered to be statistically significant. Any 
peri-CET pathology will also be documented.  
 
Aim 3: Assessment of safety and tolerability 
 
Subject self-assessments of treatment tolerability will be cond ucted immediately after 
treatments, and at each follow-up visit and phone survey using a 10-point visual analog scale 
VAS, (Appendix 3 -B).  The subject will be asked to report their current level of pain and the 
maximum level of pain experienced since the la st treatment. The surveyor will remind the 
subject of the VAS criteria and record their repl y. The VAS is the standard for assessing pain 
for both clinical and research purposes22.  
 
Recording of adverse events will take place at all visits (see adverse event reporting form 
Appendix 5). Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.  
 
A treatment will not be administ ered if there is residual pain /discomfort experienced by [CONTACT_464379].   
 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
Treatment administered to the subjects will be documented by [CONTACT_3433] e operator and tracked on 
the Case Report Form (CRF).

SAFETY MONITORING 
ADVERSE EVENT 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a s ubject, whether or not 
related to study product or study procedures. Adverse events in clude any occurrence that is 
new in onset, an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition and c linically significant laboratory 
values.  
 Exceptions 
The following medical occurrences will not be reported as AEs; 
• Pre-treatment Adverse Events; Any medical occurrence that occu rs after informed 
consent, but before first administration of ITU treatment or fi rst study procedure is 
considered as medical history an d only recorded as an AE if it worsens during the study. 
• Pre-existing medical condition; Events that occur with compara ble frequency and 
severity to the subject’s baseline condition are reported as medical hi s t o r y ,  n o t  A E s  
unless they become exacerbated during the study.  
• P r e gn a n c y ;  Th i s  i s  n o t  a n  A E  h o w ev e r  t h e  P I  m u s t  r e p o r t  a n y  p r egnancies to The 
Guided Therapy and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for adv ice regarding the 
appropriate course of action.  
  
Study Specific Expected Adverse Event 
The following AEs are expected due to the use of these study pr oducts and/or procedures and 
for this specific study, they will not be regarded as AEs;  
x Transient erythema may be expected as a result of the study tr eatment which is 
expected to subside after a few hours. This will not be recorde d as an AE unless 
persistent after 24 hours. 
x Subjects may experience mild-m oderate tingling, warming, pain or discomfort during 
the study treatments.  These wil l not be recorded as AEs unless  persistent after 24 
hours or if they increase to severe/unbearable sensations .  
 
The following AEs may be expected due to the use of these study  products and/or 
procedures and for this specific study, they will be regarded a nd recorded as AEs; 
 
x While trained personnel will administer the study treatments, there is a possibility for 
operator error that may result in a burn or high skin irritatio n response. These will be 
recorded as AEs.

 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in any of t he following outcomes: death; a 
life-threatening event; in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; prolongatio n of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital a nomaly or birth defect. Any other 
important medical event may be considered a SAE when the event may jeopardize the subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed 
previously. Examples of such medical events include allergic br onchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, or convulsions that do not result in in-patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Just as a stable pre-existing condition is not  an AE, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_464350] (e.g. cosmetic or dental procedure) of a pre-existing  condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not an SAE. 
SEVERITY AND RELATEDNESS OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
An AE will be recorded only once, with the most extreme severit y. Severities are defined as: 
Mild Awareness of symptoms which require minimal or no treatment and  d o  n o t  
interfere with daily activity 
Moderate  Discomfort or low level of interference which is enough to inte rfere with but not 
prevent daily activity and may require treatment 
Severe  Interrupted or unable to perform usual daily activity and usual ly requires 
treatment. 
 
The likelihood that the AE was re lated to the st udy product or study procedure is defined as; 
Not Related The AE is clearly due to an alternative cause, even if this can not be definitely 
identified. Alternative causes include disease, concomitant med ications, or 
environmental factors. 
Uncertain A connection between the AE and the study product or procedure cannot be 
ruled out with certainty. 
Definitely The AE is clearly related to th e study product or procedure. 
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
All AEs will be recorded in the CRF and submitted to the IRB at  t h e  e n d  o f  t h e  s t u d y  
treatment phase and at the end of the regression phase. The sit e staff must maintain source 
documents to fully record all AEs.  
Additionally SAEs must be reported immediately to the IRB Title  with [ADDRESS_595067] details for repo rting any expedited AE are 
given in the Contacts section of this protocol.  
In the event that the percent of study related AEs is ≥25% for a specific AE symptom, the 
IRB Title should be noti fied within [ADDRESS_595068] comply with the specific reporting requ irement(s) of the ethics 
committee.  
PREGNANCY  
Females may not participate in this study if they are pregnant,  breastfeeding, were pregnant or 
gave birth within the last three months or are planning a pregn ancy during the course of the 
study.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION 
Up to 25 subjects will be enrolled onto the study to ensure a m inimum of 25 subjects 
complete. 
STATISTICAL METHODS 
A sample size of 25 per protocol s ubjects will be required to d emonstrate statistical 
significance (two-sided alpha=0.05; 80% power). Descriptive sta tistics will be calculated for 
comparison to the values noted in the existing literature.  
MONITORING 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_464351], if required, study-rel ated monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access t o source data/documents. 
Sponsor personnel, or their designees, may monitor the study. T he monitor has the 
responsibility to familiarise the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_464352] f involved in the study with 
Therapy procedures. The monitor c an visit the clinical study ce ntre on a regular basis such 
as before the first subject has been enrolled, during the cours e of the study, and at study 
completion. The monitor must maintain the confidentiality of th e study documents. Regular 
visits may be made to monitor clinical procedures throughout th e study duration. 
DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_464353]. All clinical data will be collected/recorded by [CONTACT_464380] (2) weeks after the completion of the initial phase of the study (Week 8).  Final, 
QA-approved raw data in SAS or Excel format (where applicable) will be sent to GTS  for 
analysis within [ADDRESS_595070] be completed legibly, using a black ballpoint pen.  Erroneous values and/or 
text must not be obliterated. Instead, the error must be crosse d out with a single line, the 
correct value/text added, and the correction signed or initiall ed and dated. At the end of the 
study, the original CRFs will be sent to The TBD Title and copi [INVESTIGATOR_464354].  
All site staff must ensure that the subject's anonymity will be  maintained. On all documents 
that are to be submitted to GTS or external laboratory, subject s must be identified only by [CONTACT_464381] t heir names. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_464355] a separate

confidential material. 
QUALITY STANDARDS 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_464359], the [ADDRESS_595071] udy completion. 
The clinical trial will be condu cted in accordance with the app roved protocol and protocol 
amendments (if applicable). However, in the unlikely event of a  major protocol deviation (i.e., 
those deviations which affect the integrity of the study or the  safety of subjects) a protocol 
deviation form will be completed by [CONTACT_079] (or designee) and submitted to 
the GTS and IRB for review and approval. The GTS will review th e deviations and determine 
if the deviation(s) would significantly affect the results, and  if deemed necessary, not include 
such data in the analysis.  All ot her minor deviations should b e recorded throughout the 
study and submitted to the GTS  Title on a monthly basis.  
ETHICS AND INFORMED CONSENT 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_464360] a copy of the protocol, informed  consent form and all 
supporting documents to an Independent Ethics Committee or Inst itutional Review Board 
who must provide written approval before study specific procedu res commence. The IEC/IRB 
must also approve any other information that is given to subjec ts such as advertisements 
and may require other documents such as study product documenta tion.   
Any modification to the agreed protocol must be agreed by [CONTACT_464383] [INVESTIGATOR_464361]/IR B. Written approval must be ob tained from the IEC/IRB 
before any amendment is implemented, unless immediate change is  required to eliminate 
hazards to the subjects or when the change(s) involves only log istical or administrative 
aspects of the study (e.g., change of monitor(s), telephone num ber(s)).   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_464362], after explanation of the aims, methods, benefits and pot ential hazards of the study. 
The consent must be obtained before any study-specific procedur es are performed. It must 
be made completely and unambiguously clear to each subject that  they are free to refuse to 
participate in the study, or that they can withdraw their conse nt at any time and for any 
reason, without incurring any penalty or withholding of treatme nt. The subject must be given 
their own copy of the information sheet and signed consent form . The original signed 
informed consent must be kept on file by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. 
REPORTING AND PUBLICATION POLICY 
Statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_464384].   
 
The Investigator or designee will issue a final report of the r esults of the study following 
completion of data collection and quality control. The report w ill include the following: 
tabulations, a summary of adverse events, a description of the study, the study number, 
dates the study was conducted, the number of subjects who parti cipated in the study as well

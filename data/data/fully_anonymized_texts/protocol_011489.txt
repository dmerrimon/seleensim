Use of a “flash-free” adhesive resin for orth odontic bracket bonding: a clinical study of 
bonding time, bond survival, an d adhesive remnant cleanup 
 
You are invited to participate in a research study, which compares a new “flash-free” adhesive with 
a conventional adhesive for orthodontic brack et bonding. You were selected as a possible 
participant because you are seeking orthodontic treatment at the University of Minnesota. We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you  may have before agreeing to be in the study. 
 This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_289759], DDS, Dr med dent, PhD and Brent Larson, 
DDS, MS, researchers at the University of Minn esota, Division of Orthodontics, Department of 
Developmental and Surgical Sciences.   Some of the materials used in the study, such as the brackets and adhesives, were donated by 3M 
Unitek, the manufacturer of these materials. Th e flash-free adhesive is  a light-cure orthodontic 
adhesive, which the Food and Drug Administrati on has approved to market for use in bonding 
appliances for orthodontic treatment.  
Study Purpose 
 
The purpose of this study is to compare the tim e required to bond brackets on upper teeth, success 
rate of these brackets, amount of adhesive re maining on the tooth surf ace once the brackets are 
removed, and time required for adhesive remnant cleanup between the new flash-free and the conventional adhesive. About [ADDRESS_353425] ment visits, possible bond failure will be recorded. 
A time of 1–2 minutes is estimated to be required for recording of bond failure per adjustment visit. 
Regular adjustment of the orthodontic appliance at  4–[ADDRESS_353426] of care, which includes bonding orthodontic 
brackets to your teeth as outlined above.

your information private. Moreover, your name [CONTACT_289764] a 
unique identification number. All data will be re ported using this number and only the investigators 
will know which identification number corresponds to which individual.  
Benefits of Study  Participation 
 
If you decide to participate in this study, you will be treated with tooth-colored ceramic brackets 
without additional charge ($200 value). You will rece ive no other direct benefit for participating in 
this study. However, future orthodontic patients could benefit from the knowledge acquired as the 
results of this study may help de velop better orthodon tic materials. 
 
Alternatives to Study Participation 
 
If you choose not to participate, your  status to receive orthodontic treatment will not be affected.  
 
Study Costs/Compensation 
 
If you participate in this study, you will not incur any costs as a resu lt of study participation. Neither 
will you receive any monetary compensation or ot her type of compensation for your involvement. 
However, you will be reimbursed for parking expe nses up to $120 and will receive a $[ADDRESS_353428].

ASSENT FORM 
 
Use of a “flash-free” adhesive resin for orth odontic bracket bonding: a clinical study of 
bonding time, bond survival, an d adhesive remnant cleanup 
 
We are asking you to participate in a study that will help us find out how  well a new “flash-free” 
adhesive for bonding braces to teeth compares to a conventional adhesive. An adhesive is basically 
the glue that holds the braces on your teeth.   We will record the time it takes to put braces on your upper teeth as well as the time it takes to 
remove the glue from them once the braces are removed. During your treatment, we will see you 
every [ADDRESS_353431] this to take  an extra 1–[ADDRESS_353432] also asked your parents for permission a nd we will show you the materials we will use in 
the study before we put the braces on. If you want, your parents can be in the room with you at all 
times. If there is anything you do not like during th e study, you can ask us to stop at any time. You 
can also ask us questions about the study at any time. If you think of any questions later, you may 
call us at [PHONE_6015].  By [CONTACT_31300], you confirm that you have read this  form with us, we have explained your role in 
the study, and that you are willi ng to participate. Remember, be ing in this study is up to you. 
Nobody will be angry if you do not want to partic ipate or if you change your mind later.

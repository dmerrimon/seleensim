Protocol:  8.4.[ADDRESS_70720] omy or whole -gland radiation therapy improves outcomes and these treatments are 
often associated with significant long -term morbidity negatively impacting quality of life parameters 
that require long -term management. Another approach has been ‘active surve illance’ but often these 
men are under staged at the time of diagnosis, and will clinically progress and ultimately receive 
definitive therapy to the whole gland, while more frequently many men opt for partial gland ablative 
therapy with surveillance.   
 
Previous research has demonstrated the value of radiation dose escalation in patients with prostate 
cancer (Bolzicco 2010, Friedland 2009). However, to date, most paradigms have focused on dose 
escalation applied to the whole gland. It is recognized that hi gher doses to the whole gland are 
associated with higher treatment related toxicities (impotence, incontinence, rectal fissures) 
(Zelefsky). Now, with advanced delivery techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT), proton therapy, and st ereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) dose escalation can be 
achieved targeting sub -volumes of the prostate. Preliminary evidence suggests that sub -volume dose 
escalation based upon molecular and anatomical imaging may improve outcomes (Eggner 2007, Ell is 
2010). This research will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for focal partial gland therapy in 
prostate cancer.  
 
There is growing concern over the risk of over treating patients who may not be at risk of dying from 
the disease. Prostate cancer r emains the sole malignancy where treatment is always delivered to the 
whole organ in routine practice. Many low risk patients therefore opt for Active Surveillance rather 
than immediate whole gland treatment to limit treatment related decrease in quality o f life associated 
with either surgery or whole gland radiation. A growing body of evidence also suggests that treatment 
of the dominant prostatic lesion/s may be sufficient to prevent systemic disease progression, and that 
small lesions less than 5 mm may be indolent, thus if left untreated initially may not be likely to 
progress in a clinically significant manor. Additionally once a dominate lesion is treated, the patient 
may return to a course of active surveillance using PSA, physical examinations, and r epeat MRI or 
biopsy as clinically indicated (Scardino 2009, Cosset 2013).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_64935] -volumes of disease for 
image-guided therapy, physicians remain reticent to escalate dose based upon imaging findings alone, 
which are inherently limited by [CONTACT_64985] (Ellis 20 10, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946] 2011). Therefore, a 
treatment planning methodology that provided direct 3D spatial correlation of imaging sets with the 
gold standard of histopathology w ould be highly effective to exclude normal tissue (false positives 
by [CONTACT_9661]) and simultaneously allow radiation dose escalation to clearly delineated “true positive” 
target volumes.

Protocol:  8.4.[ADDRESS_70721] therapy incontinence, and 
erectile function toxicities were limited, with promising short - to medium term disease free survival 
outcomes (Valerio 2013). In a separate critica l appraisal of focal therapy for localized prostate cancer, 
Eggener et al. (representing an international multidisciplinary task force with expertise in prostate 
cancer) evaluated “the focal lesion paradigm” ( Eggener 2007) and the role of focal ablative th erapy. 
This review panel concluded with encouragement for prospective clinical research in emergent focal 
technologies for the treatment of unifocal and biologically unifocal prostate cancer – as needed 
options for men resistant to active surveillance and watchful waiting.  A number of other authors from 
major universities, have more recently reported good outcomes with whole -gland, unilateral and focal 
ablative cryotherapy applications. These authors list focal ablative options to include focused 
ultrasound, brachytherapy, thermotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery 
(Polascik 2008, Hou 2009, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9698] 2010, Boomers 2013). Radiation therapy is uniquely qualified for 
use in focal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_64936] a standard of care for pros tate cancer treatment with long 
term outcomes showing safety and efficacy for whole gland disease control, and growing evidence 
with partial gland focal therapy (Ellis  2010, Katz 2010, Cossett 2013).  
 
Focal image -guided radiation therapy is a novel alternative that may provide a cost -effective and less 
morbid treatment option for men diagnosed with low -risk disease.  Conceptually, focal therapy targets 
only diseased prostatic tissue and spares adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissue which may be as 
efficacious as whole -gland therapy but with less side effects. Further, clinical evidence suggests that 
the α/β ratio of prostate cancer is quite low providing an opportunity for greater therapeutic gain with 
hypofractionated courses of radiotherapy compared to traditional fractionated treatment. The 
hypothesis of this proposal is multiparametric MR data including T2 weighted, contrast enhanced, 
and diffusion weighted imaging when correlated with marked histopat hology biopsy sites confirming 
tumor foci, will allow appropriate patient selection for focal radiation therapy with a higher sensitivity 
than routine MR imaging alone. Further, that using advanced imaging to guide dose modulation in 
focal stereotactic bod y radiation therapy (SBRT), also named stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, may 
provide equivalent outcomes to whole -gland therapy with shortened treatment courses and decreased 
toxicity. This prospective investigational review board (IRB) approved, single institution pi[INVESTIGATOR_64937] I/II and consortium supported multi -center clinical research trials for focal SBRT in localized 
low-risk prostate cancer pati ents.  
 
Most recently, parametric sequencing MRI have been reported to identify prostatic regions that are 
highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_64938] (Valerio 2013). The current study will be used to help select for the 
proper group of patients for whom focal therap y may be appropriately offered. Men who have a 
diagnosis of localized prostate cancer with only moderately elevated PSA and Gleason score of 7 or 
lower without either a dominate pattern 4 or a tertiary pattern 5 seen on initial pathology may be 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]                  Page 7 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 eligible fo r evaluation, as these patients meet the institutional clinically accepted determination 
making them eligible for Active Surveillance (AS). Many men meeting AS criteria, however, prefer 
treatment with curative potential, and opt for partial gland therapy a iming at limiting potential 
treatment related toxicities that may be associated with treatment to whole gland. A staging 3T MRI 
is our adopted standard of care evaluation for men presenting for radiation therapy planning with 
parametric sequences. In the c urrent study we will use the staging and treatment planning images to 
evaluate regions highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_64939] a screening tool for appropriateness of focal 
therapy and for eligible patients, for use in guided biopsy to confirm pathology on the  imaging studies.   
Standard radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer is delivered at 1.[ADDRESS_70722] a lower alpha beta ration 
describing the cell line’s ability to repair damage caused by [CONTACT_22256]; many centers have 
routinely adopted into clinical practice that prostate cancer may be treated using larger d oses per 
fraction ranging in size from 3 to 19 Gy in as many as 20 or as few as a single fraction of therapy 
(Brenner 1999) .  The assumption is that the alpha beta ration of most tumors is as high as 10, while 
the surrounding normal tissues at risk of late  radiation reactions is around 3 to 5 ( Yoshioka 2013). 
Positive histopathology findings on co -registered diagnostic MRI data sets (T2 and parametric  
functional imaging) will be used to segment a dominant biologic target volume and improve disease 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a cross the gland. Subjects will then be treated in a series of three SBRT (typi[INVESTIGATOR_64940]) treatments to deliver a total dose of 29.25 Gy in 9.75 Gy fractions, yielding a total biologic 
equivalent dose (BED) of 273.15 allowing dose to reach the d esired minimal BED of 268 with an 
assumed alpha beta of 1.2 for prostate cancer as suggested by [CONTACT_64986] (2011). A similar dose 
regimen has been published by [CONTACT_64987].al. using HDR brachytherapy in a three fraction dose 
escalation trial to deliver minima l dose of 30 Gy in 3 fractions over two days to a maximal dose of 
34.5 Gy at 11.5 Gy per fraction. ( Barkati 2012). While the published [ADDRESS_70723] significant 
influence on the selected treatment volumes in this study beyond what wou ld be used based on 
functional and anatomic imaging studies alone.  
2.0 Study Objectives  
Hypothesis:  Multiparametric MRI with histopathological correlation can be used to treat sub -
volumes of the prostate with focal SBRT in low - and intermediate -risk patients leading to equivalent 
outcomes as whole -gland therapy with reduced toxicity and improved quality of life.  
 
To validate the above hypothesis in this prospective study, the specific aims include:

6.1.1 Description of Radiation Therapy  
Radiation treatment will be delivered using Elekta  S Agility, LINAC -based technology (SBRT). Prior 
to SBRT [ADDRESS_70739] 1 week will elapse between fiducial marker  and hydrogel spacer  placement 
and treatment planning simulation to allow for fiducial settling and any potential for migration. Using 
a LINAC -based SBRT system, the techn ique of motion control will be abdominal compression and 
/or rectal balloon, combined with 4D CT simulation. This information related to treatment and 
treatment planning will be recorded and processed in the UHCMC Seidman Cancer Center 
Department of Radiat ion Oncology password protected electronic medical record per institutional 
policy. 
 
Imaging the Prostate  
All patients will undergo a Serum Creatinine clearance study prior to MRI exams. Patients who are 
unable to undergo a staging MRI scan with contrast d uring screening will not be eligible for the study. 
Prior to radiation therapy, all patients will have a staging 3T MRI (utilizing a body coil) of the pelvis 
to include standard (T2 weighted) and multiparametric MRI sequences (to include Dynamic Contrast 
Enhanced and Diffusion Weighted scans or mpMRI) with gadolinium contrast. Axial, sagittal and 
coronal MRI scans are required for all MRI scans.  
 
CT and MRI Treatment Planning Simulation  
Each patient  will have a treatment planning simulation prior to delivery of SBRT at least 1 week 
following the insertion of radio -opaque fiducial markers implanted in the pro state for target 
localization and daily set up during fractionated dose delivery. A custom mad e immobilization device 
consisting of a whole body vac bag and vacuum wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Medical Intelligence BodyFix) will be 
made for every patient. A CT scan with and without contrast of the pelvis will be performed with the 
immobilization device in place. If th e patient is not a candidate for CT contrast, non -contrast CT will 
be performed. Treatment planning CT scans must take into account the respi[INVESTIGATOR_64947]. A 4DCT 
or combination of end -inspi[INVESTIGATOR_64948] -expi[INVESTIGATOR_64949].  A treatment pla nning 
MRI (with contrast is preferred and using standard MRI and mpMRI sequences as described above 
for the staging MRI) will be acquired following placement of fiducial markers and prior to delivery 
of SBRT. A rectal balloon may be used during simulation and treatment, as tolerated by [CONTACT_6992].  
 
Dose Specifications  
Radiation will be delivered in to 29.25 Gy in 3 fractions (9.75 Gy per fraction) to involved sub -
volume/s of the prostate using VMAT by [CONTACT_64990] S with Agility collimator (Elekta, Stockho lm, 
Sweden and Atlanta, GA) as focal therapy. Dose escalation to organs -at risk surrounding the prostate 
target volume is not allowed. Dose constraints of normal tissues surrounding the target will be set to 
limit toxicity. Although this three fraction SBR T regimen is novel, the tolerance levels selected for the 
normal organs are consistent with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol RTOG 0938

have failed therapy using acceptable clinical standards, such as the Phoenix definition (a rise in PSA 
following nadir of 2 ng/mL) or biopsy proven locally recurrent or persistent disease, the patient may 
be offered other curative therapy or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_64951], depending on the patient’s clinical status and 
intent to treat.  
 
Dose Coverage  
The isodose  line used for the prescription dose should cover a minimum of 95% of the PTV. This will 
be recorded in the Department electronic medical record for each patient.  
 
Minimum Dose  
The minimum dose within the PTV to a point that is 0.[ADDRESS_70740] be ≥95%  of the prescribed 
dose. This will be recorded in the electronic medical record for each patient.  
 
Critical Structures  
Critical Organ Dose -Volume Limits  
The normal tissue volume to be contoured will include bladder, rectum, bilateral femora (to the level 
of ischial tuberosity), seminal vesicles, penile bulb, neurovascular bundles, skin, and urethra. The 
normal tissues will be contoured and considered as solid organs rather than contouring the bladder 
and rectal walls. The bladder should be contoured from it s base to the dome. The rectum should be 
contoured from the anus (at the level of the ischial tuberosities) for a length of [ADDRESS_70741] for each patient.  
 
Supportive Measures  
Urinary 
Symptomatic urinary medicines, (e.g. tamsulosin) are allow ed at the discretion of the treating 
radiation oncologist or urologist.  
 
Bladder 
Patients will be asked to have a full urinary bladder both during simulation and treatment. Consistent 
bladder filling procedure should be used for an individual patient for simulation and for each 
treatment. Bladder filling may be achieved by [CONTACT_64991] 16 -24 oz of water or other fluid 
2-3 hours prior to treatment and to not urinate between this time and treatment as they are able.  
 
Bowel 
Patients will be advised to adhere to a low gas, low motility diet commencing one day prior to the 
treatment. One tablespoon of Milk of Magnesia will be taken the night before the simulation and the

Protocol:  8.4.2020 Technical Factors  
Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment  
This protocol will require treatments to be performed with an image -guided technique with the use of 
a 3-D coordinate system define d by 3D sub -volume/s of the prostate using VMAT by [CONTACT_64990] S 
Agility collimator (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden and Atlanta, GA). A computerized method for image 
registration is required for determination of the patient shift information. Serial MRI images with 
parametric sequencing will be used both to evaluate intra fraction response and post therapy response. 
The intrafraction image (between the second and third fraction) will be evaluated for yield in intra -
therapy response, that may be useful future in clinical applications such as in MRI -Linac based 
adaptive radiotherapy planning. Post therapy serial MRI will also be used to evaluate radiographic 
determined response to therapy, versus pre and mid treatment scans and as compared to clinical 
features such  as PSA follow -up.  
 
All available image sets will be co -registered using clinical software such as MIM Maestro (MIM 
software, Cleveland, OH) and PercuNav (Invivo, Gainsville, FL) and/or evaluated using our available 
in-house developed software for image r egistration verification, as is customary for clinical cases. 
Imaging data will thus be transferred to our Linac based treatment planning system Pi[INVESTIGATOR_11038], Philips 
Medical Systems (Cleveland, OH) for SBRT delivery. We will also use 3D cone -beam kV CT for 
alignment of in-vivo fiducials to track and adjust for internal target motion detection.  
 
As previously described (6.1 Description of Radiation Therapy) a minimum of three and maximum 
of five radio -opaque fiducial markers will be inserted in to the prostate for use in fractionated dose 
target positioning during SBRT (delivered in three fractionated doses on 3 different days, typi[INVESTIGATOR_64952]). At least one fiducial marker for treatment planning will be guided to a prostatic 
region reported on mpMRI t o be highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_64953].  
 
For patients who have not previously received a targeted biopsy (in -gantry MRI or US-MRI fusion), 
during this fiducial marker placement procedure, and just prior to needle insertion to place the fiducial 
marker, a  guided biopsy will be targeted to the location of disease suggested by [CONTACT_64993]. An FDA approved sterile surgical needle will 
be introduced either transrectally or transperineally through which th e biopsy needle will pass. 
Following extraction of tissue sample, a fiducial marker will be placed in each of 3 -5 biopsy cavities 
and recorded for spatial in-vivo orientation with to the anatomic and functional image sets (US, CT, 
MRI and mpMRI).  
 
If additional mappi[INVESTIGATOR_64954],  other sextant regions of the prostate reported as normal

Protocol:  8.4.[ADDRESS_70744] subsequent biopsies required for active surveillance.  
Inserted permanent fiducial markers will satisfy the following requirements for prostate cancer: (1) 
good radiographic visibility on kV imaging/diagnostic Xrays, (2) minimal distortion of delivered 
dose, (3) minimal artifacts on MRI and CT images used for treatment planning, and (4) minimal 
migration during treatment. Temporary markers (biopsy needle tip tracking) will be used to track 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_64956] (≤12 additional sites) and all biopsy locations will be recorded and tracked 
for in-situ position and for subsequent correlation to pathology findings and sequential MRI scans. 
Individual biopsy tissue samples will be labeled and processed by [CONTACT_8236]’s clinical pathology 
laboratory for prostate biopsy reporting.  
 
Three D (3D) mappi[INVESTIGATOR_64957] (CBCT). Doses reported for kV 
cone beam CT on the Elekta Synergy machine are in the range of <3 cGy per image Alaei (2010).  
The doses for 3D imaging systems are anticipated in this study to be around [ADDRESS_70745]’s daily during treatment cGy. Thus one may assume that the total dose delivered 
daily may actually be at least 9.87 cGy when taking into account the prescribed dose of 9.75 Gy and 
the 12 cGy daily IGRT. This would yield a total BED of 273.15 f or an alpha beta of 1.2 allowing us 
to reach the desired minimal BED of 268 suggested by [CONTACT_64986] (2011).  
 
Localization  
We will use a set -up CBCT, as well as repeat CBCT after every 3.[ADDRESS_70746]’s will be acquired daily as 
initial setup and after every 3.[ADDRESS_70747]/physicist, mon itoring of intrafraction motion may be required 
more frequently.  
 
Imaging studies for staging, treatment planning and response to therapy monitoring  
 
Multiparametric and Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( mpMRI) 
Prior to radiation therapy, all patients will have standard of care staging and treatment planning MRI’s 
of the pelvis, with contrast unless clinically contraindicated, using standard morphologic imaging 
sequences, per institutional standard of care imaging protocols for anatomic detail and localization. 
Additional functional mpMRI sequences will also be acquired and evaluated to enable morphologic 
and/or quantification of various tissue parameters as are routinely ordered prior to radiation therapy.  
The duration of the entire mpMR imaging procedure (patie nt on the scanner table) will be no longer 
than at total of [ADDRESS_70748] single diagnostic MRI scan. 
Quantitative MRI data may include analysis of some or all of the following parameters:  
  
Diffusion weighted imagin g (DWI):  
 Measurement of b -value assesses different levels of diffusivity within tumor tissue and normal 
tissue.  
 Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) will be calculated as a quantitative measure from 
multiple b -values by [CONTACT_64995] l esion.   
CASE [ZIP_CODE]                  Page 17 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.[ADDRESS_70749] enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI): 
 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_64958], contrast agent exchange rates of tissues and distribution of contrast between the 
various tissue spaces  using standard evaluation models.  
 Quantitative assessment will be performed with post processing techniques as commercially 
available as well as post processing software under investigation or development to 
demonstrate feasibility with currently availab le and future techniques.  
  
These sequences will be recorded for virtual comparison to the standard MRI sequences to determine 
if the investigational functional data correlates with histopathology data, and to determine if these 
data would have changed th e radiation therapy contouring and dose delivery. Any change in treatment 
planning due to functional MRI versus standard sequences alone will be recorded, and evaluated for 
utility in the determination of tumor response to therapy.  
 
Target Delineation  
All clinically relevant radiologic images will be transferred to the Radiation Oncology Pi[INVESTIGATOR_11038] 
(Philips, Cleveland, OH) treatment -planning system. Using the various MRI sequences and the CT 
image data sets, a composite gross tumor volume (GTV) will be genera ted. The focal GTV will be 
contoured and approved by [CONTACT_64996]. The 4D CT will be fused 
with the treatment planning CT and an internal target volume (ITV) will be generated. The location 
of tumor foci from each positi ve biopsy core will also be segmented and expanded by 5mm to add to 
the PTV along with imaging data sets. An additional 0.[ADDRESS_70750] SBRT (MRI) with multiparametric sequences (mpMRI)  
Each subject will be offered up to 4 additional MRI scans: 1 during therapy (between the 2nd and 3rd 
fractionated treatments), a t 6 months following the end of radiation therapy, and again at 12 and 24 
months. All mpMRI will be requisitioned in the same manner as described above (Staging MRI) as 
described above at page 16 (6.1 Imaging the Prostate ), with the exception that contrast  with 
gadolinium is preferred. If patients are unwilling or clinically unable to undergo contrast or have all 
follow-up MRI scans, the patient will remain on study and followed for PSA response and toxicity 
outcomes .   
 
Computed Tomography (CT)  
CT will be fused with MRI scans and used as a primary image platform for treatment planning. It is 
preferred that CT with contrast be acquired, unless clinically contraindicated. The simulation should 
be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_64959], in the custom made immobilization device, with the 
fiducial markers and rectal balloon in place (where utilized). Axial cuts of 2.[ADDRESS_70751]

6.2  Radiation Therapy Adverse Events  
All patients will be seen in the radiation oncology department during radiation therapy. Any 
observations regarding radiation reactions will be recorded and should include attention to the 
following potential side ef fects: 
 Small bowel or rectal irritation manifesting as abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], diarrhea, rectal urgency, 
proctitis, or hematochezia  
 Bladder complications including urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, urinary tract 
infection, and incontinence  
 Radiation dermatitis  
 
Clinical discretion may be exercised to treat side effects from radiation therapy. Examples of typi[INVESTIGATOR_64960], such as diarrhea, include diphenoxylate or 
loperamide. Bladder or rectal spasms are us ually treated with anticholinergic agents or tolterodine.  
Bladder irritation may be managed with phenazopyridine. Erectile dysfunction is often treated with 
medical management or mechanical devices. A record of the incidence and management of side 
effects will be recorded in the electronic medical record as a usual course of care and the data will be 
reported in a Case Report Form.  
 
Definition of an Adverse Event (AE): Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment 
or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure 
(attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). [CTEP, NCI Guide lines Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements. January 2005; http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html]  
  
Definition of an SAE: Any adverse experience occurring during any part of protocol treatment and 
30 days after that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse experience  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64961], when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
the definition.  
 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4 for reporting of adverse events (AEs). The CTCAE version 4 is identified and located on

9.0  Safety and Effectiveness Assessments  
The primary goal of this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_64964] a s a mappi[INVESTIGATOR_64965], providing a more informed 
method for the delivery of focal hypofractionation treatments. Hypofractionated radiation using 
SBRT is a promising tool for delivery with intent to cure. The use of fo cal partial prostate SBRT 
should show lower toxicity, and will be evaluated for equivalent efficacy. A co -primary end point of 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_64966]. There will be two co - primary endpoints based on summary scores from the bowel and 
urinary domains of the EPIC questionnaire. Although HRQOL is collected at multiple time points, it 
has been decided that EPIC, EQ D5 and Sexual Medication/Device Screening data collected at 6, [ADDRESS_70762] the primary hypothesis. The 
percentage of patients with change in EPIC bowel domain score (baseline to 1 -year) that was worse 
than 5 points and a change in EPIC urinary domain score that was wor se than 2 points are felt to be 
clinically meaningful endpoints to assess for tolerability and safety. A rate for the worse -than-5 point 
change in bowel score of up to 35% of patients will be considered acceptable, with a rate ≥55% 
specified as unacceptabl e. Similarly, a rate for the worse -than-2 point change in urinary score of up 
to 40% will be considered acceptable, with a rate ≥60% unacceptable. The PSA results along with 
serial MRI assessments will be used to test the hypothesis of equivalent disease c ontrol compared to 
historical data for whole gland therapy using SBRT. Standard of care quality of life assessments 
International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) scores will 
be acquired as part of the standard care prior to and following SBRT. When collected, this data will 
be collected and reported.  
Analysis of the Primary Endpoints  
Treatment efficacy will be analyzed through PSA response, clinical exam, with the addition of serial 
MRI evaluations. Confirmation of m ultiparametric MR targets for focal SBRT with image guided 
biopsy, histopathology and fiducial marker position tracking will be evaluated for reporting accuracy 
of multiparametric and standard MRI sequences to detect disease. Prostate MRI including T2 -
weighted, contrast -enhanced, and diffusion weighted imaging along with computer aided detection 
(CAD) may be used to identify suspi[INVESTIGATOR_64967].  Chi -
square and cluster analysis will be used to correlate degree of su spi[INVESTIGATOR_64968].  Post therapy 
MRI will be used to report response to therapy as either complete, partial, stable or progressive by 
[CONTACT_13407].  
9.1  Safety and Efficacy Endpoints  
Assessment of early clinical outcomes in focal SBRT for low risk prostate cancer patients.  Twenty -
four hormone naïve low to intermediate risk prostate cancer patients will be screened for PSA level, 
acute toxicities and quality of life (QOL) measures at baseline and twelve will be followed at 
longitudinal follow -up appointments.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 Acute and Late GI and GU Adverse Events (AEs)  
Adverse events are evaluated by [CONTACT_64998] (CTCAE). We will record in Oncore the highest grade reported during a reporting 
period. The treatment -related attribution includes definitely, probab ly or possibly related to treatment. 
An acute adverse event is defined as the first occurrence of worst severity of the adverse event ≤30 
days after the completion of RT. We will evaluate the acute radiation therapy -related adverse events. 
Specifically, we  are interested in the percentage of acute GI and GU Grade 3+ adverse events that 
may occur, which is considered to be similar to the high RT dose arm of RTOG [ADDRESS_70763] an acceptable adverse event profile. We will report the percentage for the regimen as 
well as the one -sided 97.5% confidence interval. For example, the number of patients in the high dose 
arm of RTOG 0126 Phase II rep orted that 1% of patients experienced Grade 3+ GI/GU acute toxicity, 
with no patient experiencing Grade 4 or 5 toxicities (citation) should be greater than this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
A late adverse event is defined as the first occurrence of worst severity of adver se event >180 days 
after RT completion. Late Grade 3+ GU/GI toxicity information will be collected and reported also.  
 
PSA Failure  
Failure occurs when the PSA is first noted to be 2 ng/mL or more than the patient’s nadir value post 
RT completion (Phoenix , Abramowitz 2009). PSA failure at 6, 12 and 24 months following RT will 
be estimated for the series by [CONTACT_64999] (Gray 1988). Also, confidence 
intervals will be reported.  
 
Disease-Free Survival (DFS)  
The disease -free survival duration  will be measured from the date of treatment to the date of 
documentation  of disease progression or until the date of death from any cause. DFS at 6, 12 and 24 
months for each patient and the series by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method (Kaplan 1958). Also, 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported.  
 
Analysis for Endpoints Related to HRQOL  
We will use three instruments to measure HRQOL: the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 
(EPIC), the Utilization  of Sexual Medications/Devices, and EQ -5D. Protocol eligible pati ents will be 
included in the HRQOL analysis only if they have provided baseline and at least one subseque nt 
measurement.  All HRQOL instruments (EPIC, the Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices and 
EQ-5D) will be collected on all cases participating in the trial. The standard departments QOL 
instruments may also be used to report outcomes with both the International Prostate Symptom Score 
(IPSS) and Sexual Health Information Measurement (SHIM) obtained from chart review.  
The EPIC Supplement Utilization o f Sexual Medications/Devices, and EQ -5D will be collected at 
pretreatment (baseline) and at 6, 12 and 24 months after radiation therapy ends. Patient self -
assessment of symptoms will be performed using four primary EPIC scales: urinary, bowel, hormonal 
and sexual symptoms. The Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices and EQ -5D Questionnaires are 
found in Appendix 3.  
For all primary HRQOL analyses we will estimate the degree of change from baseline to 6, [ADDRESS_70764] will be used to evaluate if the change is different from 0. Confidence

Protocol:  8.4.2020 The primary objective in HRQOL analysis is to estimate the c hange from baseline to 24 months.  The 
response will be the change of measurement from baseline to 24 months (or the last available HRQOL 
data point where data are missing). The one -sample t- test will be used to test the null hypothesis that 
response chan ge is 0. For the regimen to maintain the overall significance level for testing three 
HRQOL instruments. In addition, we will describe the distributions of HRQOL data collection 
patterns over all collection points in each treatment arm.   
Demonstrate dosim etric and biological advantage of focal SBRT versus whole -gland therapy  
Treatment plans from focal versus simulated whole -gland SBRT for each patient will be compared 
for target volume size, dose distribution, and dose reduction to organs at risk (OAR). Ad ditional 
assessments  for planning volumes based solely  on imaging versus with correlated histopathology to 
define PTVs will be collected, evaluated and reported. Biological modeling will be used to evaluate 
tumor control probability and normal tissue compl ication probability (NTCP) betw een the two 
treatment paradigms  (focal versus virtual simulation of whole gland treatment using conventional 
treatment per institutional standards). Standard independent methods of dosimetry calculations will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_65000] -investigators, utilizing 
such programs as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_64969], and Monte Carlo simulations. Subject data sets 
appropriately de -identified by a stu dy co-author may be additionally evaluated utilizing  advanced 
software MRI analysis for predictive modeling and comparison to tumor volume selection as 
identified with histopathology validation.  
We estimate that [ADDRESS_70765] imaging sessions (MRI and CT Simulation) for treatment planning and delivery of 
radiation therapy. Interim imaging reports  will be provided to the funding partners following the first

their data added to the Urologic Oncology & Minimally Invasive Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_64970]. 
 
Should any unanticipated adverse events occur during the course of the study, the clinical research 
coordinator will ensure that they are documented by  [CONTACT_65001] -current gui delines.  If the determination is made that an 
unanticipated adverse event presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the clinical evaluation will be 
paused, or if deemed appropriate (to enable further investigation), the subject will be withdrawn as 
soon as safely possible.   
 
Adverse events, grade 3 and above, will be captured in OnCore and will be reported in accordance 
with the Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan (DSMP) that is approved by [CONTACT_65002] (and aligned with the NCI -approved plan).

Protocol:  8.4.[ADDRESS_70767] – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, subject PSA, DRE and PSA data will be recorded in Oncore  as 
evaluations for response to radiation therapy, per standard of care procedure during post radiation 
therapy follow -up visits. In addition  to PSA and DRE evaluations, RECIST (v.1.1) measurements 
will be acquired using mpMRI surveillance. Response and pr ogression will be evaluated in this study 
using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_39695] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228 -247, 2009]. Changes in the largest 
diameter (unidimensiona l measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. We will also analyze volumetric response to 
therapy based on serial MRI data that will be evaluated using radiation oncology  treatment planning 
computers.  
 
Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity All patients will be evaluable for acute toxicity within [ADDRESS_70768] guideline, v. 1.1. [European J of Cancer. 45: 228 -247, 2009] will be used  as 
applicable to the protocol. See 
Hhttp://ctep.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf H for further detail s. 
Additional definitions beyond the RECIST guidelines specific to this protocol are incorporated to 
define local control as described below (Eisenhauer 2009). We will evaluate and report RECIST 
measures minimally at [ADDRESS_70769] radiation therapy .  
 
Response Criteria: Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target  
    lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of  
    target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on   
    study (includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest  
  on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm. The appearance of new lesion(s).  
 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]                  Page 28 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient  
    increase to qualify for PD, taking the smallest sum diameters as  
    reference while on study.  
 
3D Lesion Volumes 
In addition to RECIST criteria evaluation on follow -up scans, we will report [ADDRESS_70770] 
measurements (Guiou 2012 and Eisenhauer 2009).  
 
Measurable Disease  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter for non -nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions to be 
recorded) as > [ADDRESS_70771] x -ray, as > [ADDRESS_70772] scan,  or > [ADDRESS_70773] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Non-measurable disease  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (< [ADDRESS_70774] diameter) wi ll be considered non -measurable disease. The presence of lymph nodes 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_64971].   
 
Target lesions   Only a single target lesion which is biopsy positive will be selected for focal therapy 
and identified as the dominant target lesion and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesion 
should be selected on the basis of size (lesions with the longest diamete r). We will use T2 weighted 
MRI image sets with contrast for the baseline measurement.  
 
Non-target lesions   All other suspi[INVESTIGATOR_64972]-target lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment. The 
same method of assessment and technique should be used to characterize the dominant lesion at 
baseline and during follow -up. Use of 3T MRI T2 scans with contrast is required for the baseline 
measurement and is the preferred method and technique for all imaging -based evaluations. The 
mpMRI image data will additionally be recorded, evaluated and reported separately.  
 
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target lesions  
 
Response  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in 
short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]                  Page 29 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.   
Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target lesions less than 5mm and /or detected on screening biop sy to involve less 
than 5% of the submitted tissue for carcinoma.  
 
Response  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 
10 mm short axis).  
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, 
they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  
 
 Non-CR/ Non-PD 
[Incomplete response/ Stable 
Disease (SD)]  
 Persistence of  one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal 
progression  should not normally trump target lesion status. It must 
be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase. 
 
Although a clear progression of ‘non -target’ lesions only is 
exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_64973], and the progression status should be confirmed 
at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement an d confirmation criteria.

RECIST (Eisenhauer 2009) Tumor Response  
Tumor measurements will be defined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_53460], and confirmed by [CONTACT_65003].   
 
Duration of overall response :   The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for stable disease (SD), partial re sponse (PR) or complete response (CR) 
- whichever is first recorded, until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment st arted) 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until 
the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. CR will be reported as unconfirmed 
CR until a repeat image shows duration of res ponse. 
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria 
for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started, including the baseline measureme nts.

10.2   Statistics  
Statistical Considerations  
Chi-square and cluster re -sampling analyses will be used to correlate suspi[INVESTIGATOR_64974].   
 
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate acute and late toxicities. In addition clinical data will be 
collected to monitor for tumor control. Digital rectal examination (DR E) and serum prostate antigen 
(PSA) will be evaluated every 3 months for two years. Toxicity will be evaluated EPIC  EQ D5, 
Sexual Medication, Device Screening Questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_65004], at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months following the end of radiation 
therapy (+/ - 14 days). Rates of acute and late side effects and adverse events will be summarized as 
proportions, with 95% confidence intervals.   
 
Biochemical failure will be based on PSA values using the Phoenix definition (clinical nadir 
+2ng/mL). Data from all patients will be pooled.   Survival rates estimated from the Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.   We will also track virtual treatment plans 
based on standard models for treatment to the whole gland versus partial gland MRI -TPUS validated 
planning to report change in dosimetric parameters of the focal SBRT versus traditional whole -gland 
treatment plans for statistical comparison.  
 
Either a positive D RE or rising PSA may be used as clinical indication for additional MRI 
surveillance. When additional MRI are available, tumor volume will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477] ±STD 
and the difference between two time points (pre and post treatment) will be examined using paired T-
test. Radiographic efficacy will be summarized by [CONTACT_65005] -Meier curves for the 
following:   disease-free survival, time to local progression, time to distant failure. Descriptive reports 
of RECIST (1.1) and volumetric findings will be pr ovided. 
 
Acute/Late Toxicity and Quality of Life Measurements  
Using multivariate analysis, we will report acute and late (>[ADDRESS_70776] SBRT) rates of GI toxicity  
with dose -volume histogram. We will also report time to event analyses collected for all ava ilable 
HRQOL data collected.  
 
Temporal pattern of quality of life scores will be summarized graphically; and repeated measures 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to test for changes in scores over time. The 
predictive value of demographic, pat hological and clinical factors on the scores will be examined by 
[CONTACT_65006].   
 
Sample Size  
Twelve patients will be evaluated in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. As a proof -of-principle study, it’s not design to 
have the appropriate power (80%) for detecting significant difference in clinic outcomes (i.e. 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]                  Page 32 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.2020 toxicities, survival or QOL), but to provide some prelim inary data for future studies. A sample of 12 
patients, however, achieves 78% power to detect 8% difference of urinary toxicity against historical 
controls under whole gland therapy using a two -sided binomial test with the target significance level 
of 0.2. We anticipate that a minimum of twenty four patients will be screened leading to twelve 
patients who will be treated and evaluated on -study in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
11.[ADDRESS_70777]’s insurer and/or to the subject.  This includes costs 
for pre-treatment diagnostic scans, fiducial markers and fiducial marker placement, treatment 
planning, radiati on therapy treatments, and post -operative follow -up for radiation therapy, are 
standard of care and will be charged accordingly. Therefore, subjects and their insurers will be fully 
responsible for the costs related to this research evaluating and comparin g standard of care 
procedures.   
 
Subjects will not be paid for their participation in this study.  
 
 
12.[ADDRESS_70778] scans, nuclear scans and MRI scans that are part of the regular 
care for this condition, whether or not they p articipate in this research. These studies will not add to 
the risk of the research. However, subjects with concerns about the overall radiation exposure or MRI 
safety issues should be discussed with a study physician.  
 
The risks associated with the MRI sc ans are the same risks as those posed by [CONTACT_65007] 
(non-research). A known risk related to MRI examinations is that the MRI magnet could attract 
certain kinds of metal that may cause injury to the patient. In order to avoid that, patients will be 
screened for any hazardous metal object that they may have or is implanted inside their body which 
includes pacemakers, intracranial aneurysm clips, heart valve prostheses and other implanted devices 
that are not compatible with MRI. Although there  is no risk from ionizing radiation with MRI, 
subjects will be exposed to strong magnetic fields and radio waves, neither of which are associated 
with any known detrimental health effects.  
 
We will use an MRI contrast agent that is approved by [CONTACT_65008]. There 
is a risk of an allergic or fibrotic reaction, which occurs more often with iodine based contrast (for 
CT) than with MRI contrast agents. Every effort will be made to minimize the risk of such reactions 
in this study by [CONTACT_65009] a history of kidney disease, which is the cohort who 
most frequently exhibits an allergic reaction. Generally, an injection of [ADDRESS_70779] agents  used in previous MRI 
scans. As with all such injections, bleeding, bruising, dizziness, fainting or infection may occur. Also, 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]                  Page 33 of 57 
Protocol:  8.4.[ADDRESS_70780] 
protected. There is some risk that subjects’ personal protected health information could be breached 
and health information made available to unauthorized individuals.  
 
Adverse ev ents are not anticipated as related to the delivery of focal therapy, beyond the normal risks 
of radiation therapy with curative intent for localized prostate cancer.  
 
Intravenous MRI contrast agents will be applied to stage each patient’s stage of disease, looking for 
local disease extension. Subjects who have a history of adverse reactions to contrast media will be 
excluded from that portion of the study as will subjects with a history of kidney disease or unacceptable 
values of creatinine and/or G lomerular Filtration Rate [GFR] (see exclusion criteria). Subjects who 
have a history of adverse reactions to contrast media will be excluded from the study as will subjects 
with a history of kidney disease or unacceptable values of creatinine and/or Glome rular Filtration Rate 
[GFR] (see exclusion criteria).  
 
In addition, we will use the MRI images obtained for staging to also map locations of intraprostatic 
tumor foci, to map the location/s of disease. Just prior to fiducial marker placement, patients will  be 
consented for a biopsy procedure during fiducial marker placement for radiation therapy set up, for 
the purpose of establishing a map of known disease within the gland. Biopsy cavities will be marked 
with in-vivo fiducials and/or using temporary in-situ marker tracking, such as the use of the echogenic 
needle tip coordinates on ultrasound. Such recorded TRUS ultrasound coordinates will be tracked and 
evaluated  for subsequent correlation of histopathology data and the mpMRI images – using all 
available image data (for example the treatment simulation MRI and CT) to inform our treatment 
planning to improve se localization of known true positive tumor foci.  
 
Additional biopsy samples will be acquired just prior to fiducial marking (permanent or temporary as 
defined above) in a sextant fashion to map disease across the prostate gland for use in treatment 
planning and staging. The risks associated with prostate biopsy sampling are similar in nature to those 
associated with the patient’s diagnostic biopsy tha t confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma. These 
risks include the risk associated with bleeding, and the possibility of infection that could be serious. 
There is additional discomfort that may be associated with the insertion of use of a rectal ultrasoun d 
probe that may be managed by [CONTACT_65010]. The fiducial marker placement procedure will be 
lengthened by [CONTACT_65011][INVESTIGATOR_64975]. This procedure will 
include the use of general sedation, which is customary with trans perineal fiducial marker placement 
and or biopsy procedures. However, additional risk may be associated with the use of such sedation 
measures over an increased timeframe during the additional biopsy sampling procedure.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 About the I -PSS 
The International Prostate Symptom Score (I -PSS) is based on the answers to seven questions  concerning 
urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life.  Each question concerning urinary symptoms 
allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom.  
The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5.  The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic 
to very symptomatic).  
 
The questions refer to the following urinary symptoms:  
Question  Symptom  
1  Incomplete emptying  
2  Frequency  
3  Intermittency  
4  Urgency 
5  Weak Stream  
6  Straining 
7  Nocturia 
 
Question eight refers to the patient’s perceived quality of life.  
 
The first seven questions of the I -PSS are identical to the questions appearing on the American Urological 
Association (AUA) Symptom Inde x which currently categorizes symptoms as follows:  
 
Mild (symptom score less than of equal to 7) 
Moderate (symptom score range 8 -19) Severe 
(symptom score range 20 -35) 
 
The International Scientific Committee (SCI), under the patronage of the World Health Organization (WHO) 
and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), recommends the use of only a single question to assess 
the quality of life.  The answers to this que stion range from “delighted” to “terrible” or [ADDRESS_70801] of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) Symptoms 
or quality of life, it may serve as a valuable starting point for a doctor -patient conversation.  
 
The SCI has agreed to use the symptom index for BPH, which has been developed by [CONTACT_65016], as the official worldwide symptoms assessment tool for patients suffering from prostatitis.  
 
The SCI recommends that physicians c onsider the following components for a basic diagnostic workup: 
history; physical exam; appropriate labs, such as U/A, creatinine , etc.; and DRE or other evaluation to rule 
out prostate cancer.

Protocol:  8.4.2020 Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC)  
Prostate cancer-specific HRQOL as measured by [CONTACT_65017] (EPIC) Instrument 
development  was based on advice from an expert panel and prostate cancer patients, which led to expanding 
the 20-item University of [LOCATION_004]-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA -PCI) to the 50-item EPIC. 
Summary  and subscale scores were derived by [CONTACT_65018]. Test-retest reliability  and 
internal consistency were high for EPIC urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domain summary scores (each 
r ≥0.80 and Cronbach's alpha≥0.82) and for most domain-specific subscales. Correlations between function 
and bother subscales within domai ns were high (r >0.60). Correlations between different primary domains 
were consistently low er, indicating that these domains assess distinct HRQOL components. EPIC domains 
had weak to modest correlations with the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health  Survey (SF -
12). Moderate agreement was observed between EPIC domains relevant to the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy Prostate module (FACT-P) and the American Urological Association Symptom Index 
(AUA-SI), providing criterion validity without excessive overlap (Wei 2000). EPIC is a robust prostate 
cancer HRQOL instrument that measures a broad spectrum of symptoms; however, to decrease patient 
burden we will only use the domains most pertinent to this study: urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal. 
The domains were validated separately, and since each domain will be used intact, there is no threat to 
validity. This reduces patient burden

Sexual health is an important part of an individual's overall physical and emotional well-being. Erectile 
dysfunction, also known as impotence, is one type of very common medical condition affecting sexual health. 
Fortunately, there are many different treatment options for erectile dysfunction. This questionnaire is designed 
to help you and your doctor identify if you may be experiencing erectile dysfunction. If you are, you may 
choose to discuss treatment options with your doctor. 
 
Each question has several possible responses. Circle the number of the response that best describes your own 
situation. Please be sure that you select one and only one response for each question.

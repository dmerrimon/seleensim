proportion of subjects who achieve HIV -1 RNA < 50copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at 
Week 48 as defined b y the US FDA -
defined snapshot algorithm. It 
will be concluded that B/F/TAF is non -inferior to DTG + F/TDF if 
the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the 
difference (B/F/TAF – DTG + F/TDF) in the response rate (HIV-1 
RNA < 50copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL as defined b y the US FDA- defined snapshot 
algorithm) is greater than - 12%; ie , a margin of 12% is applied to 
non-inferiorit y assessment. The 95% CI will be constructed using a 
normal approximation method based on stratified Mantel -Haenszel 
proportions, where stratification factor include
sbaseline HIV -1 RNA 
(≤ 100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  vs. > 100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL).
The co-primary  efficacy  anal ysis will consist of a non- inferiorit y test 
of FDC of B/F/TAF versus DTG + F/TDF, with respect to the 
proportion of subjects with plasma HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL  at 
Week 48 by  [CONTACT_236699] = Fail ure approach. It will be anal yzed in a 
similar manner as described for the primary  efficacy  endpoint , except 
that the stratification factors include HBeAg status (positive vs. 
negative) and baseline HBV DNA (< 8log 10IU/mL vs. 
≥ 8 og 10IU/mL) .
To control ty pe I error for the assessment of the primary  and the 
co-primary  efficacy  endpoints, the hy pothesis testing will be 
performed using the fallback procedure {Wiens 2005} in the sequential 
order with pre -specified 1 -sided alpha level. The primary  hypothesis 
of noninferiorit y of B/F/TAF relative to DTG + F/TDF, with respect 
to the proportion of subjects with HIV- 1 RNA < 50copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  at 
Week 48 (as defined b y the FDA snapshot anal ysis) will be tested 
first. Non- inferiority  test will be performed at one -sided, 0.025 alpha 
level. If non- inferiorit y is established, the co -primary  hypothesis of 
noninferiority  of B/F/TAF relative to DTG + F/TDF, with respect to 
the proportion of subjects with plasma HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL at 
Week 48 using Missing = Failure approach will be tested second at 
one-sided, 0.025 alpha level. Otherwise, the co -primary  endpoint will 
not be tested at all.
The secondary  anti-HIV efficacy  endpoints include:

1.1. Background
There is an urgent need to address HIV and HBV coinfection worldwide. Both HIV and HBV 
infection can lead to chronic disease, with attendant morbidity  and mortality  that is 
synergistically  exacerbated by  [CONTACT_236700]. 
Over 2 billion people are infected, 400 million chronically  with Hepatitis B Virus, (HBV), which 
is a primary  cause of chronic liver disease and a major contributor to mortality , contributing to 
half the burden of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV is endemic i n parts of 
Asia and Africa, with 70% of the population showing serologic evidence of current or prior 
infection and approximately  8-15% with chronic hepatitis B infection {Kalayjian 2003 }, {Drake 
2004}, { Kourtis 2012} .
There are estimated to be 35 million people living with HIV/AIDS, with the majority  in Asia and 
Africa; estimates ranging for a total of approximately  3-6 million individuals coinfected with 
HIV and HBV, coinfection rates are as high as 25% in areas where both viruses are endemic 
{Kourtis 2012} . 
Coinfection worsens morbidity  and mortality  synergisticall y; HIV -HBV coinfected patients have 
higher HBV DNA levels and progress to chronic hepatitis B five times more quickly  than HBV 
monoinfected patients and have higher risk of cirrhosis and HCC.
In HIV -positive patients co-infected with HBV, F/TDF or F/TAF are the preferred NRTI 
backbone of a full y suppressive antiretroviral regimen {Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for 
Adults and Adolescents 2016 }. For the majorit y of monoinfected chronic hepatitis B (CHB) 
subjects, life- long treatment is required as onl y a small percentage (< 10%) of subjects 
experience sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and as a consequence, achieve 
an effective cure of the disease. However, data in HIV/HBV coinfected patients are limited 
{Charpentier 2015}. 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a novel prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), has the potential to advance 
treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection, including those who are coinfected with HIV. In 
contrast to TDF, an oral prodrug that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y cleaved b y ester ases in the intestines and plasma 
to TFV, TAF has been specificall y synthesized to resist earl y enz ymatic cleavage following oral 
administration and remain mostly  intact until penetrating target cells. By  [CONTACT_236701] y, TAF whe n administered at a lower dose than TDF, is capable of 
efficientl y delivering active drug (e.g. tenofovir diphosphate [TFV -DP]) to the cells where it is 
needed (e.g. HBV -infected hepatocy tes, HIV -infected ly mphoid cells) while sy stemic exposures 
of TFV are greatl y reduced in comparison to oral administration of TDF 300 mg. In support of 
the concept of enhanced delivery  of active drug for treatment of HBV, a study  in dogs showed 
70% of the orally  administered TAF dose is extracted by
 [CONTACT_236702] p ass metabolism. 
Additionally , TAF has in vitro been shown to be efficientl y taken up b y hepatocy tes where 
intracellular concentrations of TFV -DP are 120 -fold higher with TAF compared with TFV, and 
B/F/TAF
Protocol GS -US-380-4458 Final

CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 06 July [ZIP_CODE]-fold higher with TAF compared to TDF. These features are hypothesized to translate into the 
potential for effective suppression of viral replication and an improved tolerability  and safety  
profile.

9883) is a potent inhibitor of HIV -[ADDRESS_286445] a 
panel of mutant viruses with resistance to NRTIs, non
-nucleoside reverse- transcriptase inhibitors 
(NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PI s).  Integrase mutant viruses that are resistant to the I NSTIs 
raltegravir (RAL) and elvitegravir (EVG) remain largel y sensitive to bictegravir .
[COMPANY_009] Sciences ([COMPANY_009]) has coformulated bictegravir with the NRTI emtricitabine (FTC; F) and 
the NtRTI  tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) into an FDC tablet that is suitable for once -daily use . 
This B/F/TAF FDC may  provide a potent, convenient, tolerable, and practical regimen for the 
long-term treatment of patien ts with HBV and HIV co -infection.

1.2.1. General Information
Bictegravir , a potent inhibitor of HIV -[ADDRESS_286446] been conducted with bictegravir . These 
include assessments of cytotoxicity , off-target receptor and ion -channel binding, effects on 
human Ether -à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) potassium current and papi[INVESTIGATOR_10789], and in vivo studies in rats and dogs that evaluated effects of bictegravir on all major 
organ s ystems. The volume of distribution of bictegravir ranged between 0.09 and 0.22 L/kg in 
the preclinical species, which indicates that the distribution of bictegravir is limited to the 
extracellular compartment due to its high binding to plasma proteins. The projected half -life of 
bictegravir in humans is approximately  20 hours based upo n the estimates of clearance and 
volume of distribution.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacology
Bictegravir has IC 50values ranging from 1.[ADDRESS_286447] HIV replication in MT4 cells with an EC 50(50% 
effective inhibitory  concentration) value of 1.[ADDRESS_286448] dividing and non -dividing human

CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 06 July 2018Bictegravir is mainly  metabolized by  [CONTACT_10834] 5' -diphospho -glucuronos yltransferase (UGT1A1) 
and CYP3A. 
Bictegravir does not inhibit major human CYP isoforms or UGT1A1 at 
concentrations up to 25 M. Consequently , bictegravir is unlikely  to be a cli nically  relevant 
inhibitor of these enzy mes, and is not expected to inhibit the metabolic clearance of drugs 
metabolized by  [CONTACT_236703]. Bictegravir only modestly  inhibits renal transporter OCT2 
(IC50= 0.42 M). As a result, bictegravir is not expected to significantl y interfere with the key 
transporter responsible for creatinine tubular elimination at the clinically  projected C max. 
Additionally , the risk that bictegravir will affect the OCT2 -mediated excretion of 
co-administered drugs is considered to be low.
Bictegravir does not activate AhR and onl y weakly activates PXR at concentrations up to 50 M 
(less than 5% and 40% of activation, respectivel y, compared to positive control compound). 
Therefore, bictegravir is not expected to act as an inducer thr ough PXR -or AhR -mediated 
pathway s at the doses and exposure levels projected in clinical use.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology
Single oral doses of bictegravir up to 1000 mg/kg were well- tolerated in rats (AD -141- 2286). 
The increase in exposure was limited (< 2 -fold) between 1
00 and 300 mg/kg and similar 
exposure was observed between 300 and 1000 mg/kg suggesting saturation of absorption at 
300mg/kg (AUC 0-242205 gh/mL  and 1931 gh/mL , respectivel y). In monkeys, single oral 
doses of 
bictegravir up to 1000 mg/kg were well- tolerated (AD -141- 2284). The increase in 
exposure was limited (<
2-fold) between 300 to 1000 mg/kg (AUC 0 -[ZIP_CODE]gh/mL  and 
1078 gh/mL , respectively ).
In 2-week (TX -
141-2029) and 26 -week (TX -141- 2031) oral toxicity  studies in rats at doses up to 
300 mg/kg/ day, bictegravir was well -tolerated with no bictegravir -related effects on clinical 
observations, bod y weight, food consumption, ophthalmic examinations, and anatomic 
pathology .  The high dose of 300 mg/kg/day  was considered the maximum feasible dose based
upon saturation of absorption. The no observed effect level (NOEL) in the 26 -week stud y was 
considered to be the high dose of 300 mg/kg/day
.  At the NOEL, bictegravir exposures in the rat 
were considered to be approximately  12-/31-fold higher (males/femal es) than the projected 
steady  state human exposure of bictegravir following administration of B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) 
QD under fed conditions.
In a 39 -week study  in monkey s (TX -141- 2032), following administration of 1000 mg/kg/day  
(high dose) of bictegravir for [ADDRESS_286449] 
hyperplasia and minimal or moderate hepatocy te hy pertrophy  in both sexes, and minimal 
regenerative h yperplasia and minimal or slight neutrophil infiltrate in males.  The macroscopic 
findin g of rough surface on the liver in one male administered 1000 mg/kg/day  correlated with 
moderate hepatocy te hypertroph y and marked bile duct hyperplasia. After a [ADDRESS_286450] hyperplasia in one female administered 1000 mg/kg/day , while 
the other two animals in the high dose group had no hepatobiliary  findings. Minimally  to mildly

observations , or effects on body  weight, bod y weight change, food consumption, ECGs, 
hematology , coagulation, clinical chemistry , urinaly sis, and ophthalmoscopy .  
No bictegravir -related effects were observed in the mid -dose group (200 mg/kg/day ) which was 
considered the no -observed- effect - level (NOEL).  The estimated margin of exposure at the 
NOEL was approximately  5.1-fold based on expected human exposure with the once dail y 
dosing of the B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) tablet. 
A standard battery  of in vitro and in vivo studies was performed to assess the genotoxic potential 
of bictegravir . There was no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in an in vitro bacterial 
reverse mutation assay  (Study  TX-141- 2026), a chromosomal aberration assay  in human 
lymphocy tes (Study  TX-
141-2027), or in a rat micronucleus test (Stud y TX - 141-2029).

2-cohort, 3 -period, crossover PK study  evaluating the drug interaction potential between F/TAF 
FDC tablet and bictegravir in healthy  subjects.
There was no difference in the overall incidence or ty pe of AEs when bictegravir was 
administered in the fasted and fed states. There was no difference in the overall incidence of AEs 
when bictegravir or F/TAF was each administered alone or in combination.
No deaths or pregnancies were reported. No Grade 3 or 4 AEs or SAEs, were reported in any  
cohort.
Changes in serum creatinine were obser ved in this study , presumably  via inhibition of the renal 
transporter OCT2.  In the MAD cohorts (fasted), serum creatinine change at Day 14 ranged from 
0.05 mg/dL for the 5 mg cohort to 0.18 mg/dL for the 300 mg/dL cohort.  In Part D (DDI), 
conducted in th e fed state (regular meal), subjects received 100 mg bictegravir monotherap y for 
7days and 100 mg bictegravir with F/TAF for 7 day s, the mean serum creatinine change at 
Day 7 was 0.14 mg/dL following bictegravir and 0.17 mg/dL following bictegravir + F/TA F.  
All changes returned to baseline after discontinuation of bictegravir .
The majority  of laboratory  abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity . Grade 3 laboratory  
abnormalities included 10 subjects with Grade 3 urine dipstick tests for blood.  Allof these 
subjects were female, none of the labs were considered b y the Investigator to be clinically 
significant, and all were associated with menstruation. No other Grade 3 or 4 laboratory  
abnormalities were observed.
Based on results in study GS
-US-141-1218, pharmacokinetic profile of bictegravir was 
characterized b y rapid absorption with time to peak plasma concentrations (median T max of 
cohorts) ranging between 1 and 4 hours following administration under fasted conditions. 
bictegravir exposures we re appropriatel y dose proportional following single dose 25 -
100mg 
dose administration, with decreasing dose proportional at higher doses.  The half -life of 
bictegravir was approximately  18hours, with no changes observed across studied dose range as 
evide nced b y parallel terminal phase slopes. A high -fat meal increased AUC infand C max 
(geometric mean, 84% and 101%, respectively ) following 100 mg single dose administration. 
Steady  state was achieved after 4 -6days of once daily  dosing of bictegravir with av erage

Protocol GS -US-380-[ADDRESS_286459] Disposition and Baseline Characteristics
A total of 98 subjects were randomized and treated in the study: 65 subjects in the B+F/TAF 
group and 33 subjects in the DTG+F/TAF group. At the time of the Week [ADDRESS_286460] s (5.1%) had prematurely  discontinued study  drug, 3 in the B+F/TAF group and 2 in the 
DTG+F/TAF group. The reasons for study  drug discontinuation were as follows (one subject 
each): AE, withdrawal of consent, and lost to follow-up in the B+F/TAF group, and
noncompliance with study drug and lost to follow up in the DTG+F/TAF group.
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Key  
baseline disease characteristics (ie, viral load, CD4+ cell count, and estimated glomerul ar 
filtration rate [eGFR] CG) were similar between the 2 treatment groups.
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline HIV -1 RNA was 4.45 (3.96, 4.79) log 10copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL , with 82.7% 
having ≤ 100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  at baseline. Five subjects (5.1%) had > 400,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  at 
baseline; of these, 4 subjects were randomized to B+F/TAF and [ADDRESS_286461] was randomized to 
DTG+F/TAF. 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4+ cell count was 444 (316, 595) cells/μL , with 41.8% of subjects 
having ≥ 500 cells/ μL at baseline. Median (Q1, Q3) baseline eGFR CGwas 
125.3 (105.7, 147.0) mL/min.
Efficacy Results
The primary  efficacy  endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV -1 RNA 50copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  
at Week 24 as determined by  [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) -
defined snapshot algorithm. The percentages of subjects with HIV- 1 RNA 
< 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at Week 24 was high in both groups, as follows: BIC+F/TAF 96.9%; 
DTG+F/TAF 93.9%; difference in percentages: 2.9%, 95% CI : −8.5% to 14.2%. Because the 
lower bound of the 95% CI  for the difference in response rate (B+F/TAF – DTG+F/TAF) was 
greater than the prespecified −12% margin, B+F/TAF was determined to be noninferior to 
DTG+F/TAF.
The percentages of subjects with HIV- 1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  at Week 48 were similar between 
the 2 treatment groups when assessed using the US FDA -defined snapshot algorithm based on 
the full anal ysis set (FAS) ( Table 1-5), as follows: B+F/TAF 96.9%; DTG+F/TAF 90.9%; 
difference in percentages: 6.4%, 95% CI : −6.0% to 18.8%.
As expected for an INSTI -containing regimen, HIV -1 RNA levels decreased rapi[INVESTIGATOR_236685]4weeks following initiation of study  drug in both treatment groups. After Week
4, HIV - 1 
RNA values were stable and similar between the 2 treatment groups through Week 48; mean 
(SD) decreases from baseline at Week 48 using the FAS were as follows: B+F/TAF 
−3.09 (0.752) log 10copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL ; DTG+F/TAF −3.11 (0.852) log 10copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL ; difference in

(each 6.1%, 2 subjects)
The majority  of AEs were Grade 1 in severit y, with similar incidence of Grade 2, 3, or 4 AEs 
between the 2 treatment groups. Grade 3 AEs were uncommon, with all Grade 3 AEs reported in 
the B +F/TAF group (6.2%, 4 subjects); only  1 Grade 3 AE was considered related to study  drug 
by [CONTACT_093] (urticaria in a B +F/TAF subject). No individual Grade 3 AE was reported for

Results from a blinded phase 3 study  were reported that compared B/F/TAF FDC to
co-
formulated abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC, T riumeq®) {Gallant 
2017}. HIV - infected, treatment -naïve, HLA -B*5701 -negative, HBV -uninfected adults with 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥50 mL/min wer e randomized 1:1 to receive blinded 
treatment with fixed -dose combination B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) or ABC/DTG/3TC 
(600/50/300 mg) with matching placebos once daily . The primary  endpoint was proportion of 
participants with HIV -1 RNA (VL) < 50 c/mL at W48 (FDA snapshot). Noninferiority  was 
assessed through 95.002% confidence intervals (CI ) (12% margin). Secondary  endpoints were 
safet y (adverse events [AEs] and laboratory  abnormalities) and pre -defined anal yses of changes 
from baseline in bone mineral densit y (BMD) and measures of renal function, including eGFR 
and proteinuria. Six hundred and twent y nine participants were randomized and treated 
(314 B/F/TAF, 315 ABC/DTG/3TC): 10% women, 36% Black, 16% VL >100,000 c/mL , 11% 
CD4 < 200 cells/mL . Median baseline characteristics: age 32 y rs, CD4 count 444 cells/μL , and 
VL 4.47 log 10c/mL . At W48, B/F/TAF was noninferior to ABC/DTG/3TC, with 92.4% on 
B/F/TAF and 93.0% on ABC/DTG/3TC achieving HIV -1 RNA < 50 c/mL (difference -0.6%; 
95.002%CI  -4.8% to 3.6%, p=0.78). No resistance mutations emerged in either group. 
Comparing B/F/TAF to ABC/DTG/3TC throughout, the most common AEs were diarrhea (13%, 
13%), headache (11%, 14%), and nausea (10%, 23%). Few participants (0 vs 4 [1%]) had any  
AEs leading to premature study  drug discontinuation. At W48, mean % changes from baseline in 
BMD were -0.83% vs. - 0.60% (p=0.39) [lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]] and -0.78% vs. - 1.02% (p=0.23) [total 
hip]. No differences between treatments were noted in changes from baseline for eGFR and 
proteinuria at W48. A t W48, B/F/TAF achieved virologic suppression in 92.4% of 
treatment -naïve adults and was noninferior to ABC/DTG/3TC, with no emergent resistance. 
B/F/TAF was safe and well tolerated with less nausea than ABC/DTG/3TC. Bone and renal 
safet y profiles were sim ilar between groups.

(adverse events [AEs] and laboratory results). There were 645 participants randomized and
treated (320 B/F/TAF, 325 DTG + F/TAF): 12% women, 31% Black, 19% viral load (VL)

4.44 log 10c/mL . At W48, B/F/TAF was noninferior to DTG + F/TAF, with 89.4% on B/F/TAF
and 92.9% on DTG + F/TAF achieving HIV -1 RNA < 50 c/mL (difference - 3.5%;
95.002%CI  -7.9% to 1.0%, p=0.12). Six subjects discontinued treatment for the following
reasons: patient decision- 3, protocol violation due to incarceration -1, lost to follow -up-1 and
investigator discretion -1. Both the Missing=Excluded (M=E) and Missing=Failure (M=F)

with HIV -1 RNA ≥50c/mL  was < 1% in each arm. No study  subject in either treatment arm 
developed resistance to any  of the stud y drugs. The most common AEs were headache (13% 
B/F/TAF, 12% DTG + F/TAF) and diarrhea (12% for both). Few participants (5 [2%], 1 [< 1%]) 
had AEs leading to premature stud y discontinuation. L ipid change s were not significantl y

An ongoing observational study  in Botswana identified neural tube defects (NTDs) in infants 
born to four of 426 women who started DTG prior to pregnancy , and were on it at the time of 
conception. The incidence rate for NTDs in these infants was 0.9%, while the reported rate of 
NTDs for HIV -infected women on non- DTG -containing regimen was 0.1%. These preliminary  
results suggest that women who received DTG at the time of becoming pregnant or early  in the 
first trimester appear to be at higher risk for these e mbry onic defects.
The following guidance has been issued regarding the use of DTG in women who are pregnant, 
who become pregnant, or are of child bearing potential.

1.5. Rationale for This Study
B/F/TAF has demonstrated efficacy  and safet y in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in 
HIV-monoinfected patients.  TAF 25 mg has been evaluated in two global Phase 3 HBV 
monoinfection studies – one each in treatment naïve and experienced HBeAg -negative subjects 
(GS-US-320- 0108) and HBeAg -positive subjects (GS -US- 320-0110) and is approved for the 
treatment of 
hepatitis B infection . 
Currently , TAF and TDF areapproved b y the US FDA for treatment of HBV - infected patients. 
This study  will examine the efficacy  and safet y of B/F/TAF versus DTG +F/TDF in HBV and 
HIV-co-infected patients. Current guidelines for treatment of HBV in HIV co-infected patients 
emphasize the need to treat co -infected patients due to higher rates of liver disease progression . 
Both TDF and TAF containing regimens are recommende d in multiple guidelines for treatment 
of HBV in HIV -1 infected patients {Gunthard 2016}, {Gorden 2007}, {Terrault 2016 },

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2
CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 06 July [ZIP_CODE].6. Risk/Benefit Assessment for the Study
HIV and HBV co- infection worsens morbidity  and mortality  synergistically; co -infected patients 
have higher risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . In HIV -positive patients co-infected 
with HBV, F/TDF or F/TAF are the preferred NRTI  backbone of a fully  suppressive 
antiretroviral regimen {Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents 2016 }. 
This study  seeks to generate safety  and efficacy  data of B/F/TAF FDC in this population 
by 
[CONTACT_236708]ïve patients .  The comparator regimen contains DTG and F/TDF, a full y 
suppressive regimen. Potential risks associated with all classes of ARVs include immune 
reconstitution sy ndrome, lipody strophy , and lactic acidosis with steatosis. The risk of class 
effects is considered to be low. Potential benefits may include provision of a new ARV therapy  
to patient population that may  have fewer side effects than alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Other potential 
benefits include provisions of fixed dose combi nation therapy , and the knowledge that patient 
participation will contribute to the body  of knowledge of HIV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
In summary , the risk/benefit for this study  is acceptable due to the following considerations: 
Treatment of HBV is indicated and important in all HIV co
-infected patients due to 
accelerated progression of liver disease
TDF and TAF are approved for the treatment of HBV infection
B/F/TAF has been proven to be safe, well tolerated and effective in the treatment of
HIV-infected patients
Hepatic flares, defined by  [CONTACT_236709] -fold above upper limit of normal, are 
not uncommon earl y in treatment initiation and will be closely monitored (refer to 
Section 7.5.4)  
Risk of n
ephrotoxicity , defined as a decreased in eGFR < 50ml/ min is considered to be low 
andwill be closel y monitored (refer to Section 7.5.5 )
The benefit -risk assessment for this study  is favorable at this time.

The B/F/TAF FDC containing B (50 mg), F (200 mg), and TAF (25 mg), has been approved by  
[CONTACT_36432] -FDA for use once daily  for the treatment of human immunodeficiency  virus t ype 1

5.1.1. Procedures for Breaking Treatment Codes
In the event of a medical emergency  where breaking the blind is required to provide medical care 
to the subject , or in the case of pregnancy  that occurs while on study  drug, the investigator may  
obtain treatment assignment directl y from the IXRS sy stem for that subject. [COMPANY_009] recommends 
but does not require that the investigator contact [CONTACT_236712]. Treatment assignment should remain blinded unless that knowledge is necessary  to 
determine subject emergency  medical care or in the event of a pregnancy  that occurs while on
study  drug . The rati onale for unblinding must be clearl y explained in source documentation and 
on the electronic case report form (eCRF), along with the date on which the treatment 
assignment was obtained. The investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_236713] y treatment unblinding .
Blinding of stud y treatment is critical to the integrity  of this clinical trial and therefore, if a 
subject’s treatment assignment is disclosed to the investigator, the subject will have study  
treatment discontin ued. All subjects will be followed until study  completion unless consent to do 
so is specificall y withdrawn by [CONTACT_423].

CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 06 July [ZIP_CODE]. ADVERSE EVENTS AND T OXICITY  MANAGEMENT
7.1. Defini tions of Adverse Events, Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse 
Events
7.1.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject 
administered a medicinal product ,which does not necessarily  have a causal relationsh ip with th e
treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and
/orunintended sign, sy mptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product. AEs may  also include pre -or post-treatment complications that occur as a 
result of protocol specified procedures, overdose, drug abuse/misuse reports , or occupational 
exposure . Preexisting events that increase in severity  or change in nature during or as a 
consequence of participatio n in the clinical study  will also be considered AEs.
An AE does not include the following:
Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery , endoscopy , tooth extraction, andtransfusion.
The condition that led to the procedure may be an adverse event and mus t be reported.
Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory  abnormalities present or detected before the 
screening visit that do not worsen
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800] , social and/or convenience admissions)
Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Section 7.6.1 )
Any medical condition or clinically  significant laboratory abnormality  with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not an 
AE. I t is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical history  
eCRF.
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
A serious ad verse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at an y dose, results in the following:
Death
Life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the e vent; it does not refer to an 
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe.)
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Persistent or significant disability /incapacit y

Protocol GS -US-380-4458 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2
CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 06 July 2018A congenital anomal y/birth defect
A medicall y important event or reaction: such events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82221]. Medical and 
scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable 
under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; bloo d dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal 
product will be considered a medicall y important event and sub ject to expedited reporting 
requirements.
7.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities without clinical significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
However, laborato ry abnormalities (eg, clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinaly sis) that 
require medical or surgical intervention or lead to IMP interruption, modification, or 
discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. I n addition, 
laboratory  or other abnormal assessments (eg, electrocardiogram, x- rays,vital signs) that are 
associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they  meet the 
definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 7.1.[ADDRESS_286503] the s yndrome or diagnosis (eg, anemia), not the 
laboratory  result (ie, decreased hemoglobin).
For specific information on handling of clinical laboratory  abnormalities in this study , please 
refer to Section 7.5.
7.2.
Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for 
causality  and severity , and for final revi ew and confirmation of accuracy  of event information 
and assessments.
7.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to IMP 
therap y using clinical judgment and the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology  other than the IMP. For SAEs, an 
alternative causality  must be provided (e .g., pre - existing condition, underl ying disease,

Requirements for collection prior to study  drug initiation:
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study  medication, the following t ypes of events 
should be reported on the case report form (eCRF): all SAEs and adverse events related to 
protocol -mandated procedures.
Adverse Events
Following initiation of study  medication, collect a ll AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, 
until 30-days after last administration of study  IMP must be reported to the eCRF database as 
instructed.
All AEs should be followed up until resolution or until the adverse event is stable, if possible. 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences may  request that certain AEs be followed bey ond the protocol defined follow up 
period.
Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur safter the subject first consents to 
participate in the stud y (ie, signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the 
study , including the protocol -required post treatment follow -up period, must be reported to the 
eCRF database and [COMPANY_009] Pharmacovigilance and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (PVE ) as instructed. This also 
includes an y SAEs resulting from protocol- associated procedures performed after inform ed 
consent is signed.

Confirmed (within 3 days of receipt of initial laboratory  results) serum ALT > 2 ×Day 1 
value and >10 × ULN, with or without associated sy mptoms.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of ALT Flare in Subjects Receiving Study  Medication
If laboratory  results indicate elevation of ALT  2 × Day  1 value and 10 × ULN, the following 
is recommended:
Schedule the subject to return to the clinic as soon as possible (ideall y within 3 days after 
initial laboratory  results were drawn). During the visit, a clinical assessment of the subject 
will be performed. The assessment should include a physical examination and evaluation of 
the subject’s mental status.
If the ALT elevation is confirmed, request the central clinical laboratory  to conduct reflex 
testing for PT/INR, plasma HBV DNA, HBV serology  (HBsAg ,HBsAb, HBeAg and 
HBeAb ), HDV, HAV IgM, and HCV serology
Check the following laboratory  parameters: serum AL T and AST, total bilirubin, I NR, and 
serum albumin. Based on the results of the confirmatory  tests, the following treatment 
modifications are recommended .

initiation of approved therap y.
The subject should be followed until laboratory  parameters (ALT, total bilirubin, I NR) return 
to normal or Day  1up to a maximum of 6 months after the initial occurrence of the event.
7.5.5. Management of Potential Nephrotoxicity
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), according to the Cockcroft -Gault formula for 
creatinine clearance, will be followed post -baseline du ring the study . All subjects with estimated 
eGFR < 50 mL/min must have serum creatinine measured again within 3 calendar day s of receipt 
of results.
At the time of this repeat serum creatinine assessment, Cy statin C will also be measured and the 
eGFR b y CKD -EPI (cy statin C) will be calculated and compared with the baseline 
measurement.

CKD -EPI (cystatin C) from baseline or who have other clinical and/or laboratory  evidence of 
acute renal failure will be discussed with the Medical Monitor and potentially  discontinue from 
study  drugs. 
For subjects with eGFR < 50 mL /min who are not discontinued based on toxicity  management 
procedures above and considered to have stabl e renal function per Principal I
nvestigator and 
Medical Monitor, it is not mandatory  to repeat eGFR assessments within 3 day s.
CKD -EPI (cystatin C) formula adjusted for age and sex:

Where Scy s is serum cy statin C (mg/L), min (Scys/0.8,1) indicates the minimum of 
Scys/0.8 or 1, and max (Scy s/0.8,1) indicates the maximum of Scy s/0.[ADDRESS_286511] labelling (as it applies to the daily  dose of the subje ct in 
question). In cases of a discrepancy  in drug accountability , overdose will be established only  
when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess dose(s). Overdose cannot be established 
when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy  except i n cases in which the investigator has 
reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Analy sis of Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
The null hy pothesis is that the proportion of subjects achieving HIV -1 RNA < 50copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
(asdefined b y the US FDA -defined snapshot algorithm) at Week 48 in B/F/TAF is at least 
12% lower than the respon se rate in DTG + F/TDF; the alternative hypothesis is that the 
response rate in B/F/TAF is less than 12% lower than that in DTG + F/TDF.
Non-inferiorit y will be assessed using the conventional confidence interval approach. The point 
estimate of treatment difference ( B/F/TAF –DTG+F/TDF ) and the associated 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval will be constructed using a normal approximation method based on stratified 
Mantel -Haenszel proportions, where stratification factor include baseline HIV -1 RNA 
(≤ 100,000 c opi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  vs. > 100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL).
It will be concluded that B/F/TAF is non- inferior to DTG + F/TDF if the lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI of the difference ( B/F/TAF –DTG+F/TDF ) in the response rate is greater 
than

B/F/TAF to DTG+F/TDF will be established.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analy sis of Co- Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint for HBV
The null hy pothesis is that the proportion of subjects with plasma HBV DNA < 29IU/mL at 
Week 48 as determined by [CONTACT_236699]=Failure approach in B/F/TAF is at least 12% lower than the 
response rate in DTG + F/TDF; the alternative h ypothesis is that the response rate in B/ F/TAF is 
less than 12% lower than that in DTG + F/TDF. For Missing = Failure approach, all missing data 
will be treated as HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL.
Non-inferiorit y will be assessed similar lyas for the primary  efficacy  endpoint, except the 
stratification factor s include HBeAg status (positive vs. negative) and baseline HBV DNA 
(<8log 10 IU/mL vs. ≥ 8 log 10 IU/mL) .To control ty pe I error for the assessment of the primary  
and the co- primary  efficacy  endpoints, the hy pothesis testing will be performed using the

, and (3) t he proportion of subjects with HBsAg loss at Weeks 48 and 96. 
All these three anti
-HBV efficacy  endpoints will be anal yzed using both Missing = Failure and 
Missing = Excluded approach. The 95% CIs will be constructed in the similar manner as 
described for the primary efficacy  endpoint with stratification factors of HBeAg status (positive 
vs. negative) and baseline HBV DNA (<
8log 10IU/mL  vs. ≥ 8 log 10IU/mL).
8.6. Safety Analysis
All safet y anal yses will be performed using the safety  anal ysis set.
All safet y data collected on or after the d ate that the study  drug was first administered up to the 
date of the last dose of study  drug plus [ADDRESS_286518]’s extent of exposure to study  drug will be generated from the study  drug 
administration page in eCRF. Exposure data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_3148].
Duration of exposure to study  drug will be expressed as the number of weeks between the first 
and last dose of the stud y drug, inclusive, regardless of temporary interruptions in study  drug 
admini stration and summarized by [CONTACT_3148].
Dosing information for individual subjects will be listed.
8.6.2. Adverse Events
Clinical and laboratory  adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA). System Organ Class (SOC), High -Level Group Term 
(HLGT), High -Level Term (HL T), Preferred Term (PT), and Lower -Level Term (LLT) will be 
attached to the clinical database.
Events will be summarized on the basis of the date of onset for the event. A treatment -emergent 
adverse event w ill be defined as any  adverse event with onset date on or after the stud y drug start 
date and no later than 30 day s after the study  drug stop date; or any  adverse event leading to 
study  drug discontinuation.

8.9. Data Monitoring Committee
An external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review the progress, efficacy , 
and safet y data of this study while the stud y is ongoing. The committee will convene after all
subjects enrolled have completed their Week 24visit or prematurel y discontinued from the study 
drug.However, [COMPANY_009] will defer to the IDMC for any
 decision to convene earlier or more 
frequentl y. The IDMC will examine the safety  results of the trial and also focus on logistical 
issues such as accrual , retention, quality  of clinical and laboratory  data, and implications of 
results of external studies. Blinding will be preserved during the conduct of the study  and access 
to unblinded data will be limited to designated parties.
No formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] w ill be used by  [CONTACT_236725] y outcomes. Rather, a clinical 
assessment will be made to determine if the nature, frequency , and severit y of adverse events 
associated with a stud y regimen warrant the earl y termination of the study  in the best interest of
the participants.
For each IDMC anal ysis performed prior to the analy sis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint, an 
alpha penalt y of 0.[ZIP_CODE] will be applied for the primary anal ysis of the primary  endpoint.

Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements
1)Definitions
a.Definition of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study , a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential 
following the initiation of pubert y (Tanner stage 2) until becoming post -menopausal, unless 
permanentl y sterile or with medically
 documented ovarian failure.  
Women are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they  are > 54 years of age with 
cessation of previously  occurring menses for > [ADDRESS_286552] is considered to be fertile after the initiation 
of pubert y unless permanently  sterile b y bilateral orchiectom y or medical documentation.
2)Contraception Requirements for Fem ale Subjects
a. Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception
The data on B /F/TAF in pregnant women is limited. There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_10824] y based on class effects or genotoxic potential. Relevant non -clinical reproductive 
studie s for human pregnancy  do not indicate a strong suspi[INVESTIGATOR_10824] y/fetotoxicity . Data from clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies of bictegravir
and F/TAF have demonstrated that there is no reduction in the clinical efficacy  of hormonal
contraception or that the effect on hormonal contraception is insignificant. Please refer to the 
latest versions of the B/F/TAF investigator’s brochure and F/TDF and DTG prescribing labels
for additional information.
Serious cases of neural tube birth de fects involving the brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and spi[INVESTIGATOR_236692]. Preliminary results from an ongoing 
observational study in Botswana found that women who received dolutegravir at the time of 
becoming pregnant or early in the first trimester appear to be at higher risk for these defects.
Please refer to the latest local product labeling for DTG for additional information.
b. Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential
The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires the use of highl y effective 
contraceptive measures.  They  must have a negative serum pregnancy  test at Screening and a 
negative pregnancy  test on the Baseline/Day  [ADDRESS_286553] study  drug dose.  In the event of a delay ed 
menstrual period (over one month between menstruations), a pregnancy  test must be performed 
B/F/TAF
Protocol GS -US-380-[ADDRESS_286554] dose of study  drug. 
Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential.  Abstinence is an acceptable 
method of contraception only  when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifesty le. 
Or
Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below. 
Intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of <1% per year
Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS) with a failure rate of <1% per y ear
Tubal sterilization
Essure micro- insert sy stem (provided confirmation of success b y hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_236693])
Vasectom y in the male partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner and 
had confirmation of surgical success 3 months after procedure)
Female subjects who wish to use a hormonall y based method must use it in conjunction with a 
barrier method, preferably a male condom.  Female subjects who utilize a hormonal 
contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have consistently  used th e same method 
for at least three months prior to study  dosing.   Hormonally -based contraceptives and barrier 
methods permitted for use in this protocol are as follows:
Barrier methods (each method must be used with a hormonal method)
■Male condom (with or w ithout spermicide)
■ Female condom (with or without spermicide)
■ Diaphragm with spermicide
■Cervical cap with spermicide
■ Sponge with spermicide
Hormonal methods (each method must be used with a barrier method, preferably  male 
condom)
■Oral contraceptives (eithe r combined or progesterone only )

CONFIDENTIA L Page 121 06 July 2018■Injectable progesterone
■Subdermal contraceptive implant
■Transdermal contraceptive patch
■Contraceptive vaginal ring
Female subjects must also refrain from egg donation and in vitro fertilization during treatment 
and until at least 30 day s after the end of relevant sy stemic exposure.
3) Contraception Requirements for Male Subjects
During the study , male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential should use 
condoms when engaging in intercourse of reproductive potentia l.
4) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods
Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides onl y, and 
lactational amenorrhea method (LAM).  Female condom and male condom should not be used 
together.
5) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy
Subjects will be instructed to notify  the investigator if they  become pregnant, or are concerned 
they may  be pregnant at any  time during the study, or if they  become pregnant within [ADDRESS_286555]. 
Subjects who become pregnant while on study  should receive appropriate monitoring and care 
until the conclusion of the pregnancy . Subjects who become pregnant while on study  who are not 
engaged in pre -natal care that includes a routine second trimester ultrasound will be referred for 
ultrasonograph y as part of study  follow -up. Instruction s for reporting pregnancy  and pregnancy  
outcome are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

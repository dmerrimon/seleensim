3.) Abstract:  
Breast radiotherapy (RT) begins with an  initial CT scan of the patient followed several 
days later by [CONTACT_347258] -setup on the couch of the 
RT device. At this time, it is critically important to both reproduce the specific patient 
posture used during th e initial CT scan and precisely align the patient (and lesion) with the 
RT device. Any difference in these two aspects can lead to under -dosing the lesion or 
overdosing critical structures like the lungs or heart. Currently, image -guided radiotherapy 
(IGRT ) and surface -guided radiotherapy (SGRT) are the two main systems used to address 
these issues. IGRT is the gold standard for aligning an internal target with the radiation 
beam but 1) uses ionizing radiation which increases radiation dose to the patient a nd 2) 
lacks real -time feedback which prolongs overall setup time, potentially leading to further 
patient discomfort and anxiety. SGRT uses external light emitters and cameras to guide 
patient setup in real -time but lacks portability and is limited by [CONTACT_4548] -of-sight obstruction, 
poor ergonomics, and prohibitive costs. Thus, there remains a tangible opportunity to 
improve the setup process for breast RT that would benefit patients and expand 
accessibility to advanced techniques.  
To achieve this aim, we have de veloped  a novel concept for patient posture 
correction and alignment using mixed -reality (MixR) visualization. MixR is an emerging 
domain whereby [CONTACT_347259] (holograms) are overlaid upon physical environments via 
immersive technology. The concept is b est implemented in optical see -through head -
mounted displays (OST -HMD), like the Microsoft HoloLens  v2 (Redmond, WA), that use 
a variety of sensors to map the surroundings, track physical objects, and render holograms 
at specific locations. Notably, these attributes are enabled while a user dynamically 
navigates a space, thereby [CONTACT_347260] 3D virtual 
objects.  
In our implementation of MixR, a user is able to simultaneously and directly view 
a patient and a reference hologram of their external surface derived from their initial 
planning CT scan. The hologram provides a visual reference for the exact posture needed 
during treatment and is initialized in relation to the origin of the RT device. Thus, by 
[CONTACT_275646] a patien t to their hologram, the correct posture is achieved while subsequently 
registering the patient with the RT device.  This is highly relevant in breast RT where setup 
is challenged by [CONTACT_347261] . Such a system removes  the need for expensive and restrictive external 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/[ADDRESS_431545] of less than $4,000, we also believe the method 
capable of improving portability, reducing cost, and increasing accessibility for centers 
with limited resources. We have developed an initial version of this applic ation using the 
HoloLens v2 and collected preliminary data using phantoms. The data supports an overall 
alignment accuracy of [ADDRESS_431546] RT. Comparisons will be made 
between MixRT and 3 -point alignment for 3D conformal photon treatment, and 
MixRT/IGRT versus IGRT alone for pencil beam scannin g proton treatment. This data will 
be used to establish viability and provide the framework for larger comparative 
effectiveness research studies and eventual FDA clearance.  
4.) Background:  
Radiotherapy workflow  
Over half of all patients treated for invasi ve breast cancer will receive some form of RT.1 
The treatment workflow for external -beam RT involves three main steps. (1) Simulation; 
A CT scan of the patient is acquired  with the patient in a predetermined position to provide 
an imaged -based, volumetric representation of the patient’s anatomy. (2) Treatment 
Planning;  This step links the patient’s CT images with the radiation beams to be delivered 
by [CONTACT_347262]. Planning occurs within a computer -based platform where a radiation 
oncologist provides contou rs for the target and critical structures, and a dosimetrist 
optimizes beam design to meet dose -related objectives. In most cases, all beams share a 
common intersection point inside the patient (i.e., patient isocenter).  (3) Treatment; Once 
the plan is rea dy (5 -10 days after simulation), the patient returns and is positioned on the 
couch of the RT device. The patient isocenter is aligned with the radiation isocenter of the 
RT device, thus linking the treatment plan to the treatment delivery. Because the tre atment 
plan is based on the specific CT acquired at simulation, it is critical that the patient’s pose, 
orientation, and any ancillary devices used during simulation be reproducible at this time.  
Image -Guided Radiotherapy  
Patient alignment with the radiation isocenter and reproduction of the simulation setup is 
achieved in a variety of ways. A 3 -point setup involves the alignment of surface marks 
(left, right, and anterior) with external lasers calibrated to intersect at the radiation 
isocenter. The 3-point setup is the most commonly utilized technique for the initial setup 
but is often supplemented with image guidance using portal imaging, stereoscopic 
radiographic imaging, fan -beam, or cone -beam CT (CBCT).[ADDRESS_431547] of increased radiation dose to the patient. 
Such dose increases the risk of secondary malignancy and should be managed through 
minimiza tion and the introduction of alternative, non -ionizing modalities when 
appropriate.3 
In addition to aligning the patient and radiation isocenters, IGRT also helps verify 
patient posture. This involves an iterative approach of adjusting the patient, assessi ng 
posture based on imaging, and then re -adjusting to minimize any difference with the 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/[ADDRESS_431548] at a 
location separate from the immediate vicinity of the patient. Certain sites, like breasts, 
require more iteration than others due to independent movement of anatomy in the 
treatment field (e.g., breast, arms, shoulders, head and neck). This  issue of non -rigidity 
distinguishes patient registration from other types of rigid registration encountered in 
medicine. Even when IGRT identifies differences in setup, it is not always intuitive as to 
how to make the appropriate corrections to patient po sture in 3D based on 2D projections 
(either planar images or 3D datasets visualized in 2D axial, coronal, and sagittal planes), 
and in certain cases the treatment volume can exceed the field of view (FOV) of the 
imaging system. These limitations as well as  the pressure to stay on schedule can lead staff 
to accept suboptimal setups with the hope that any difference in patient posture will have 
minimal effect on the dose distribution; ultimately, this depends on several factors, 
including the extent of the ta rget and its relation to critical structures, the uniformity of the 
dose distribution, the type of delivery, and modality. Certain modalities, such as proton 
therapy, are extremely sensitive to changes in the amount of material between the beam 
entrance an d target [i.e., the water equivalent path -length (WEP)].4 Changes in body 
posture are a primary cause of WEP discrepancy and can lead to significant under -coverage 
of the target.  
Surface -Guided Radiotherapy  
Surface -guided radiation therapy (SGRT) is a tech nique that complements IGRT in many 
respects. While IGRT excels at aligning internal anatomy, SGRT emphasizes the matching 
of external surfaces.[ADDRESS_431549] a known light pattern onto the patient’s skin that is 
reflected and captured by [CONTACT_347263]; thereafter, the patient surface can be 
reconstructed in 3D and displayed on a conventional 2D monitor. Several studies have 
quantified the benefits of S GRT in comparison to a tradition al 3-point setup (no IGRT) for 
patients with tumors of the breast, chest wall, and extremities.6-[ADDRESS_431550] with the couch or behind other anatomy. 
Obstruction is also a limiting issue for certain room designs when components of the RT 
delivery system can block the overhead cameras during portions of the set up process. 
Besides obstruction and FOV limitations, SGRT is not currently optimized for the ways in 
which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347242]. Because the real -time surface is displayed on a computer 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/[ADDRESS_431551] 
their gaze from the patient, resulting in a cognitive delay and interruption of the natural 
hand -eye coordination used to perform patient adjustments. Furthermore, monitor size and 
distance limit the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ ability to observe  small details, and the overall design 
eliminates the possibility of direct observation. For instance, it is currently impossible to 
make a direct eye -level inspection to determine registration accuracy between the patient 
surface and the reference body su rface. This type of inspection comes naturally to a human 
observer and improves the perception of size, irrespective of distance.[ADDRESS_431552]: Align RT (Vision RT, London, [LOCATION_006]), 
Identify (Varian  Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), and Catalyst (C -Rad, Uppsala, 
Sweden). While costs for these systems vary, the baseline price for a single, stand -alone 
system is in excess of $100,000.  
Mixed Reality Visualization  
Mixed reality (MixR) is an emerging domain whereby [CONTACT_347259] (holograms) are 
overlaid upon physical environments via immersive technology. The concept is best 
implemented in optical -see-through head mounted displays (OST -HMD) which use a 
variety of sensors to map the surroundings, track 
physical objects, and render virtual objects at 
specific locations. Notably, these attributes are 
enabled while a user dynamically navigates a  
space, thus affording natural viewing and even 
interaction with holograms (Figure 1). MixR 
differs from both virtual reality (VR) and 
augmented reality (AR). In VR, the user is closed 
to the physical world and sees only the virtual 
environment. In AR, vir tual content is displayed 
in the real world, but the content typi[INVESTIGATOR_347243], e.g., Google Glass. MixR 
can be thought of as a more sophisticated version of AR, though the terminology is not 
completely settled. The first usage of MixR in medicine began in the early 2010’s with 
physical simulators,[ADDRESS_431553] recently with a commercial off -
the-shelf system, HoloLens (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) released in 2016.17-21 
Currently, the HoloLens (now on version 2) and the Magic Leap One (released in 2018 by 
[CONTACT_347264]., Plantation, FL) are the only two devices competing  in the consumer space 
for MixR implemented using OST -HMDs.   
MixR offers incredible potential to the me dical professional. At a basic level, MixR 
can be used to improve both situational awareness and information management by 
[CONTACT_347265]’s local space. In the 
surgical suite this has been implemented usi ng virtual 2D panels to display pre -operative 
planning materials (images, notes, etc.) directly within the surgeon’s field -of-view.[ADDRESS_431554] area related to the orientation and/or positioning of external tools in 
Figure 1.  Example of MixR in an 
industrial setting using the HoloLens v2.  
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/[ADDRESS_431555] placed in the physical space 
and subsequently recognized through feature detection. In the latter, the system utilizes 
visual simultaneous localization and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (VSLAM), a process that involves 
estim ating the spatial relationship between the OST -HMD and multiple key points 
identified within a series of viewpoints.[ADDRESS_431556] developed a novel method for registering a patient with an RT device using 
a hologram as an intermediary [i.e., MixR -Guided Radiotherap y (MixRT)]. The hologram 
is generated based on the body contour derived from the patient’s planning CT dataset 
(Figure 2A -B). The patient isocenter is linked to the hologram and registered to the 
radiation isocenter through a simple procedure using both ma rker and marker -less tracking 
(Figure 2C). In this way, the patient isocenter is linked to the radiation isocenter. The 
hologram can be viewed directly through a commercial device (HoloLens v2) and provides 
the reference posture to be matched during patien t setup (Figure 2D -E). The approach 
improves upon SGRT in that the patient’s surface (real as opposed to reconstruction) is 
matched to a reference surface. Obstruction, FOV, ergonomic, and economic limitations 
are all remedied through the use of the Holole ns v2 and inside -out tracking, which allows 
the user to view the patient and hologram directly from multiple angles using one portable 
device. The key feature of the system is the way in which it transforms non -rigid 
registration into rigid registration by  [CONTACT_347266] -effective mechanism 
for reproducing patient posture without the use of ionizing radiation. While IGRT will still 
be required in certain cases to observe internal anatomy, by [CONTACT_347267] e IGRT is reduced, subsequently reducing setup time and the radiation dose 
associated with imaging. We thus envision MixRT being used independently or in 
conjunction with minimal IGRT to improve speed and accuracy while simultaneously 
reducing the radiatio n dose to the patient from additional imaging.

In preparation for this study, we have 
developed a preliminary application to 
enable  MixRT and provide initial 
estimates of hologram stability, 
alignment accuracy, and user 
variability. In one experiment, three 
users were tasked with aligning a rigid 
anthropomorphic phantom with an RT 
device (linear accelerator) while 
wearing the HoloLens  v2. Each user 
performed the alignment five times, and 
accuracy was quantified using IGRT.  
For each user, all five measurements were completed within the same session. Between 
measurements, the setup was disassembled and reset.  The results shown in Table 1  
preliminary estimate an overall accuracy of 3±1 mm. These results were consistent between 
all users across all sessions. Considering the preliminary nature of the study, these results

Perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_347245]. Feasibility will be based on the 
accuracy, overal l setup time, and amount of IGRT needed when utilizing MixRT for patient 
setup in breast RT  and in comparison, with current methods . Comparisons will be made 
between MixRT and 3 -point alignment for photon treatment, and MixRT/IGRT versus 
IGRT alone for pen cil beam scanning proton treatment. This data will establish viability 
and provide the framework for larger comparative effectiveness research studies and 
eventual FDA clearance.  
 
6.) Research Plan:   
 
 Describe the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this project: This study will 
target adult patients  who are planning to undergo photon or proton radiation therapy 
at UF HPTI for treatment of the breast or chest wall.  As this type of treatment is rare 
in men, the study will focus on female patients only.  
 
 Provide a thorough step -by-step description of what you intend to do 
throughout the course of the study in a logical and sequential format:   
 
Hologram creation  
For all patients included in this study, we will create holograms based on the external 
body co ntour derived from their planning CT dataset . This contour is routinely 
segmented  during treatment planning; thus, we will only need to access the existing 
contour located in the software system MimVista and export it to our software 
system . We will also access patient setup photos  located in a clinical file system  and 
export  these  to our application . 
 
Mixed -reality guided patient setup  
At UFHPTI, we treat breast/chest wall patients using various modalities and 
techniques. In all cases, patient setup begins  with a [ADDRESS_431559] 
patients treated with 3D conformal photon therapy (3DCRT) receive only weekly 
IGRT, including kV orthogonal and MV portal imaging. The  3-point alignment, 
thus, represents the standard setup for the majority of treatment, both here and across 
the nation, as 3DCRT is the most common technique for breast RT. As such, one of 
our primary aims  is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_347246] a traditional breast setup involving 3 -point 
alignment (5mm tolerance).  
 We will recruit [ADDRESS_431560] group, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347247] 3 -point 
alignment during fractions 1-5 (5 total), then using MixRT for fractions 6-10 (note: 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/[ADDRESS_431561] RT). For the second group, we will reverse 
the order, using MixRT for fractions 1-[ADDRESS_431562] (one of the co -
investigators) who will qualitatively assess the accuracy of the setup while blinded 
to the setup method.  The proc ess for mixed -reality alignment is noted below:  
1. Identify the patient and initialize their hologram by [CONTACT_207060] a QR -coded 
cube attached to the treatment device.  
2. Setup the patient according to their setup photos, related immobilization 
devices  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] o nly an inclined breast board) , and [ADDRESS_431563] alignment. To evaluate this, we will recruit an additional 
12 patients scheduled to receive RT using a supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], pencil -beam scanning approach. 
As with 3DCRT /IMRT  approach , we will divide patients into two groups  using an 
alternating method  and alternate the setup approach between fractions 1-[ADDRESS_431564] prior to treatment. Patient alignment will be 
verified/quantified  in a similar manner as noted above . 
 
A window period of [ADDRESS_431565] 10 fractions.   
 
 To summarize, we intend to enroll 12 patients receiving either 3DCRT or IMRT and 
12 patients receiving proton therapy. Within each modality, patients will be 
randomized into two groups using an alternating method. T he order in which MixRT 
will be utilized  will be reversed between the groups . The measured data will include 
registration accuracy (6 DoF shifts), setup time, and number of CBCT’s utilized. 
Registration accuracy will be quantified using the image registration module that is 
used as part of the IG RT process. Setup time will be quantified using a stopwatch. 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/[ADDRESS_431566]’s will be quantified via counting the number that are used 
during the setup process.  Patients receiving photon IMRT receive daily  CBCT as 
part of the standard of care. Thus, th is investigation would likely not introduce 
additional imaging dose  for these patients. For proton therapy CBCT is used weekly, 
and for 3DCRT it is not routinely used. Thus, this investigation would represent a 
marginal increase in the utilization of CBCT for these patients, up to [ADDRESS_431567]’s nominally.  
 
Setup during Verification CT  
Radiotherapy patients at UFHPTI often receive repeat CT scans (verification scans) 
at periodic timepoints during the course of treatment to assess for anthropomorphic 
change s that could have dosimetric effect. Reproducing the posture from the initial 
CT simulation is critically important yet difficult to achieve due to the lack of real -
time feedback. For patients who receive  a verification CT (likely all proton patients) , 
we will implement holographic  alignment during this process and assess its accuracy 
in comparison to CT acquisition without the aid of holographic alignment. The 
procedure will be as follows:  
 
1. Identify enrolled  patients scheduled to receive a verification CT scan.  
2. Setup patient without the aid of holographic alignment (standard 
method).  
3. Acquire verification CT scan.  
4. Dismantle the setup.  
5. Utilize holographic alignment to correct patient posture. This involves a 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347248] 2 device and viewing  the patient’s 
reference hologram overlaid the patient. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347249].  
6. Re-acquire verification CT scan.  
7. Export datasets to MimVista software.  
8. Register each dataset with the simulation CT using mutual i nformation 
based automatic alignment.  
9. Quantify registration accuracy of the outer body contour both 
qualitatively and quantitatively, the latter of which will utilize similarity 
metrics such as the Hausdorff distance and symmetric mean absolute 
surface di stance.  
 
 Discuss procedures for recruiting and consenting potential study participants:      
Eligible patients who are planning to undergo radiot herapy at UF HPTI will be 
approached by [CONTACT_347268]. Since 
this will not affect the patient’s actual treatment course, they may be simultaneously 
enrolled in any of the other protocols open at the time.  
 
 Describe the targeted study population (the target population should be 
representative of the population that ma y potentially benefit from the research) 
and the setting in which the research will take place: Our application should

example of this, and the study will focus on patients undergoing this type of 
treatment.  
 
 If you intend to use a vulnerable population, describe the scientific and ethical 
reasons for including them and what, if a ny, additional safeguards are needed 
to protect them: We do not intend on targeting vulnerable population s. However , 
UF/Shands staff and students will be considered for participation. We feel we cannot 
refuse them potential enrollment if they present to us , meet the eligibility criteria, 
and wish to participate in the study. We will adhere to the strict policies and 
confidentiality and the informed consent process with these patients as with all our 
patients. Potential subjects are presented with treatment alternatives as part of the 
informed consent process. It is stressed that participation in the clinical study is 
entirely voluntary,  and that consent can be withdrawn at any time without penalty.  
 
 Describe how potential subjects will be identified and recruited:  Patients will be 
identified and recruited during their pretreatment workup . 
 Describe how subjects protected health information will be accessed and by 
[CONTACT_20898]: Data will be accessed and collected from the treatment planning system, 
RayStation, clin ical database software, MimVista, and the radiation oncology 
information system, Mosaiq. These are all clinical systems used to facilitate patient 
treatment at UFHPTI.  Only the investigators and research staff will screen or access 
patient medical records for the purpose of this study.  
 
 Describe how consent will be obtained, by [CONTACT_20898], and in what setting, and how 
and where consent will be documented: Patients will be consent ed during standard 
of care clinic visits by [CONTACT_990]/consent trained staff .  Document ation of informed 
consent will be noted in the patient’s chart in Mosaiq.   
 
 Describe the number of subjects that will be screened , and the number of 
evaluable subjects needed based on power analysis: Up to [ADDRESS_431569] 
preliminary data to help establish viability of the method.  
 
 Describe completely all drugs, devices,  or instrum ents that are being proposed: 
This study involves no drugs. The specific device, HoloLens 2, will be worn by [CONTACT_137335][INVESTIGATOR_347250]. This device will display relevant information needed 
during the setup procedure including setup photos and the  patient’s hologram as 
registered to the radiotherapy device.  Final positioning will be made according to 
IGRT which is standard of care.  
 
 Provide a clear and concise description of the treatment, intervention,  or 
observation to be carried out in the study : The intervention for the study is the 
use of the HoloLens v2 device to aid in patient alignment. As noted in the study 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/[ADDRESS_431570] with the patient. The sensors 
on the device emit only non -ionizing signals such as IR . 
 
 Clearly state the nature of the experimental control (placebo, other    treatment, 
historical) or the absence of a control:  Patients who receive verification CT , each 
patient will have their own control represented by [CONTACT_347269] t he use of holographic alignment. During the use of MixRT during patient 
setup, each patient will also have their own control represented by [CONTACT_17210] -set of 
fractions where data is collected but holographic alignment is not employed.  
 
 Describe any randomiza tion procedures : Randomization is included during the 
use of MixRT guided patient setup  where the patients are segmented into two 
groups. The order in which holographic alignment is introduced into the course of 
treatment is reversed for the two groups. Th e purpose is to control for setup variation 
which typi[INVESTIGATOR_347251].  
 
  Describe completely all physical examinations, blood tests, x -rays, any special 
tests or procedures, surveys, questionnaires, and/or observa tions that will be 
used to obtain information about subjects: No additional tests will be done  that 
are outside the radiotherapy workflow. The study does include an increased 
utilization of specific aspects of the radiotherapy workflow, namely addition CT and 
CBCT acquisition.   
 
 Describe who will be responsible for obtaining the information and in what type 
of setting the information will be obtained:  Data will be collected during the 
course of radiotherapy treatment and during the acquisition of verificati on CT scans. 
Either t he study investigators  or trained radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347252].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_347253].  
 
 Describe how these activities will answer the study questions:  The main question 
we seek to answer is whether mixed reality visualization is a feasible method for 
patient alignment in radiation therapy. To answer this question, we will collect 
relevant clinical data including registration error, registratio n time, and the amount 
of imaging used during the registration process. While we are not yet attaching 
power or a formal sample size structure to this data, we believe this data work 
together as our primary endpoints to answer the question of feasibility.  
 
 
 Clearly describe  the procedures you will use to protect the privacy of subjects 
and ensure confidentiality of all data and study records including hard copy 
and computer files:  For a given patient, we will export from our treatment planning 
system a DICO M structure and plan file. This data will exist within computers 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/2023                              Page 14 of 17                                             BR05  controlled by [CONTACT_347270]. This type of 
information is commonly exported and temporarily stored for clinical operations. 
The files will be converte d to a new file type that is readable by [CONTACT_347271] v2 
device . The data will then be uploaded to the HoloLens v2 device. The HoloLens v2 
is basically a wearable computer system. Data encryption is enabled on the 
HoloLens v2 by [CONTACT_347272].  The HoloLens v2 device will remain on -
site (UFHP TI) at all times and be securely stored when not in use.  
 
Data collected during patient setup, e.g., setup time, registration shifts, number of 
CBCTs, will stored in an excel spreadsheet located in a secure fol der on computers 
controlled by [CONTACT_30967]. Each patient will be given a study ID to 
anonymous the data stored in the excel spreadsheet.  
 
   Discuss how research interventions differ from standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
alternatives to participation in  the study, if they exist:  As noted in the background 
section, IGRT, SGRT, and [ADDRESS_431571] scan. We believe by [CONTACT_347273], patients can be 
aligned faster and with less utilization of ionizing radiation.  
  
7.) Statistical Analysis:   
 
 Describe the statistical analysis you will use to analyze your data including 
sample size and associated power:  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  The choice of sample size 
is one of practicality . 
 
 Briefly outline the data analyses that are proposed and who will do the analysis:  
Mean estimates and associ ated 95% confidence intervals will be attained for 
registration error and registration time for the mixed reality and standard of care 
methods and the paired difference of the two techniques. We will assess feasibility 
using a paired T -test. The hypothesis  is that the mean paired differences across all 
measures of registration error and registration time are not significantly different 
than 3 mm and 5 minutes, respectively. The number of CBCTs collected as part of 
the registration process will be assessed s ubjectively since count data are not truly 
continuous . This analysis  will be carried out by [CONTACT_347274].  
 
 Describe your plan for conducting interim analysis.  What stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_347254]? N/A.  
   
8.) Data Safety and M onitoring Plan:   
 
 Is there a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or an oversight committee 
for this research project? The UF Data Integrity & Safety Committee will provide 
oversight through annual monitoring.

 Describe your plans for monitoring study conduct and subject safety: The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_347255].  
 
 Provide Information about the DSMB or committee including who is on the 
committee, how frequently will the committee meet,  and when will you get 
information from the committee: N/A  
   
9.) Possible Discomforts and Risks:   
 
 Identify all discomforts and risks (physical, psychological, social, and/or 
economic) study participants may encounter, listing more common risks first 
and less common risks separately:  Based on prior study utilizing anthropomorphic 
phantoms, we anticipate that our patient alignment system will ultimately reduce 
setup time and the number of X -ray images used for alignment. We have yet to try 
this with patien ts, however, and there is a risk that it could marginally increase setup 
time, at least during the initial implementation.   
 
The study also involves an increased utilization of CT and CBCT in order to quantify 
the difference in registration accuracy when u sing the mixed -reality method. 
Patients who receive a verification CT  will receive [ADDRESS_431572] 
scans  (depends on modality) . While it is routine for breast [ADDRESS_431573] imaging is orders of magnitude less than the dose 
received during treatment , (approx. 1 -2 mGy vs 45 Gy). According to the linear -no 
threshold model, there is non -zero risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a radiation induced malignancy 
from any level of ionizing radiation. We believe the marginal increase in risk 
incurred through participation in this study, however, is low based  on the limited 
amount of radiation delivered during CT and CBCT acquisition and the fact that 
these patients are already receiving high levels of ionizing radiation as part of their 
cancer treatment.   
 
Only those Adverse Events related to the use of the HoloLens will be reported.  
 
 Identify potential financial risks study participants may incur:  None    
 
 Indicate any procedures, medications, tests, or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347256] (or their insurer) will have to pay for.  Are these considered 
standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_347257]? None  
 
 Describe procedures to protect against or minimize potential discomforts and 
risks:  For individual cases, we will discontinue the use of the holographic alignment 
system if setup time is increased by [CONTACT_227139] 30% during two consecutive sessions.  
 
PI [CONTACT_15261]:  02/02/2023                              Page 16 of 17                                             BR05   Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated 
benefits and in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably 
be gained:  We believe the marginal increase in risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a radiation 
induced malignancy incurred through participation in this study is low . The 
immediate benefit to the study participants is that the additional CT and CBCT may 
improve the accuracy of their setups for instances in which these images are 
acquired. The long -term benefit for patients outside the study cohort will be the 
knowledg e gained about the clinical use of mixed -reality for patient setup. We 
believe this method can improve the patient setup and alignment process and will 
eventually make the process faster and with the use of less ionizing radiation.   
 
10.) Possible Benefits :  
 
 Describe the potential benefits to subjects or to others that may be reasonably 
expected to result from the research:  Based on prior study utilizing 
anthropomorphic phantoms, we anticipate that our patient alignment system will 
ultimately reduce setup time and the number of X -ray images used for alignment. 
By [CONTACT_347275], we increase patient comfort and minimize the risk of patient 
movement during treatment. By [CONTACT_347276] X -ray images used, we 
reduce the amount of ionizing radiation the patient receives.  
 
 If there is no potential for direct benefits, you must state this in the Informed 
Consent Form: Due to the fact that CBCT will be utilized for all study fractions, 
patients may benefit from a more accurate setup if CBCT was not standard of care 
for their treatment approach.  
 
 Will the research study benefit future populations? Yes, possibly.  
   
11.) Conflict of Interest:

DESIGN:  A two -arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) among young 
men who have sex with men (MSM) in Georgia, Mississippi, 
and North Carolina. Participants randomized to the intervention 
will receive the ePrEP home care system for telem edicine 
PrEP care that includes initiation and maintenance in care.  The 
ePrEP home care system consists of a smartphone application 
(app) for video- based telemedicine PrEP consultations  with a 
clinician, messaging and remote tracking system, and behavioral risk surveys that are complemented by [CONTACT_687841]. Home kits allow for remote testing for 
standard laboratory tests for PrEP care. Participants 
randomized to the control condition will be referred to their nearest PrEP provider to receive standard of care. Both groups 
will conduct quarterly surveys through an electronic interface 
and home specimen collection of dried blood spot s for 
detection of medication at 6 and 12 months after 
randomization.  
  
DURATION:  Participants will remain in the  study for 12 months  after 
randomization . 
  
SAMPLE SIZE:  240 participants  (120 intervention, 120 control)  
  
POPULATION:  Age 18 -29, HIV -negative, MSM, from Alabama, Georgia, 
Mississippi, and North Carolina, targeting 50%  recruitment of 
highly impacted groups of Black or Latino MSM.  
  
STRATIFICATION:  1:1 randomization , each site will enroll ~80 participants.  
Participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
  
DATA  
COLLECTION:  A secure electronic survey platform will be used to collect 
participant data through quarterly surveys. All laboratory tests 
will be conducted in CLIA- certified laboratories, including the 
test for the primary study outcome. App paradata will be 
collected within the study app. Data regarding PrEP care interactions between study clinicians and staff will be collected 
through the study app. Case report form data will be collected using an electronic data capture system. Intervie ws will be 
audio -recorded and professionally transcribed . 
  
OBJECTIVES  1) To assess protective levels of  PrEP for those randomized to 
ePrEP system versus those assigned to the standard of care  
(control ) condition, as determined by a biomarker for TFV -
DP. 
2) To conduct additional assessments to contextualize trial 
results and facilitate appropriate scale -up.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1  Background  
In 2015, MSM continued to account for two- thirds of new HIV cases in the [LOCATION_002]. [1] Within 
this elevated risk group, Black MSM and young MSM aged 15- 24 bear disproportionate 
burdens ,[1] and represent priority populations for intervention.  Rural and peri -urban areas across 
the Southeast do not have substantial access to PrEP providers .[2] The National Center for Health 
Statistics  (NCHS)  classifies counties into six levels of urbanicity: the two smaller levels contain no 
PrEP providers in Georgia, despi[INVESTIGATOR_687823] a substantial MSM population 
(>20,000). [3] Home -based care has the potential to quickly make PrEP services available to the 
large number of MSM in rural and small town areas who currently lack access.  
PrEP scale -up in the US may also be limited by [CONTACT_687842]. A home -
based PrEP support system could address some patient concerns regarding PrEP uptake. One 
limitation of PrEP is the heavy burden of follow -up visits borne by [CONTACT_1962], including indirect cost 
(i.e. absence from paid work, need for child- care) and direct cost (i.e. transport, co -payments) [4] 
that could lead to problems with PrEP adherence. [5, 6] The home care system for PrEP is 
compr ised of inexpensive, commonly available laboratory supplies such as finger prick devices, 
swabs, and microtubes. Patient self -completion surveys that simulate clinician visit typi[INVESTIGATOR_687824] a higher volume of patients due to time savings. Given 
these inputs, the home care system has the potential to be cost saving, depending in part on the level of human resources required to maintain patients in home care.  
Past efforts to address PrEP uptake or adherence for YMSM have been conducted predominately  
in urban areas, and the most successful programs have been approaches tailored for urban 
YMSM. The premise for the study is  that a tailored approach for YMSM  using telemedicine, 
addressing known barriers of transportation, access  to providers, and privacy, is most likely to 
yield high levels of PrEP initiation and persistence in care.   
Using a smartphone  application ( app), participants assigned to the intervention will  receive and 
maintain a PrEP prescription without needing to le ave their home (excepting pharmacy pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up 
or initiation laboratory testing for Hepatitis B in some cases ) – achieved through app-based  
surveys/screenings,  telemedicine consultations , and home specimen self -collection.  
 
1.2  Rationale 
1.2.1  Young , Black , and Latino  MSM are at high and elevated risk for HIV, and PrEP has been 
demonstrated to prevent HIV transmission.  
In 2015, MSM continue to account for two- thirds of new HIV cases in the [LOCATION_002]. [1] Within 
this elevated risk group, Black MSM (10,315/26,645, 39%) and young MSM aged 15- 24 
(7,150/26,645, 27%) bear disproportionate burdens .[1] PrEP has high effectiveness: in 
international settings PROUD[7]  found 86% reduction in anticipated infections . In domestic 
settings, follow -up of Kaiser Permanente patients in the San Francisco Bay area found no new 
cases of HIV  among patients prescribed PrEP. [8]     
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_932946] urban categories (noncore and micropolitan) counties had no PrEP clinics, despi[INVESTIGATOR_687825] >20,500 MSM, [3] with the patient population spread across hundreds of miles. 
In practice, this translates to ‘PrEP deserts’ that have no near provi ders.  
 
1.2.3  HIV prevalence is high among MSM residing in rural areas.  
People residing in areas classified as not being a part of a metropolitan statistical area accounted 
for 18% (7068/[ZIP_CODE]) of new HIV diagnoses in the US in 2013. [1] HIV prevalence among MSM 
in rural counties is high, with many counties exceeding 15% prevalence. [9] 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective:  
Assess protective levels of PrEP  for those randomized to the ePrEP system versus those 
assigned to the standard of care  (control ) condition, as determined by a biomarker for TFV-DP. 
2.2 Secondary Objective:  
Conduct additional assessments to contextualize trial results and facilitate appropriate scale- up: 
Aim 2.1  Adjusted analyses of the primary outcome (protective levels of PrEP)  that control for 
potential residual confounding, and analyses of secondary outcomes including components of PrEP care continuum . 
Aim 2.[ADDRESS_932947] a series of in- depth interviews with participants regarding their experiences 
along the PrEP care cascade, and with key informants  regarding their experiences with e PrEP. 
2.3 Additional Analy ses: 
Conduct cost -effectiveness and cost -utility analyses of the e PrEP intervention.  
2.4 Study Hypotheses/Research Questions   
Those assigned to the ePrEP intervention will be further along the PrEP care continuum , with 
protective levels of PrEP (the primary outcome) higher among those assigned to e PrEP.  
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
PrEP- naïve MSM will be recruited into the study, with a focus on Black and Latino MSM, targeted  
to make up half of all participants . A screening will  be conducted online and involve a screening 
consent and questions to determine initial  eligibility . This will be  followed by a full consent  (if 
eligible) , a baseline survey,  and the return of self -collected specimens for  testing to determine  
clinical Pr EP eligibility . Those eligible for the study will be enrolled into the trial and randomized 
to either intervention ( ePrEP) or control (standard of care) . Participants  assigned to the ePrEP 
intervention (n= 120) will have a baseline teleconsultation with a site study clinician who will be 
responsible for prescribing PrEP as indicated. [10] Intervention participants will be offered 
telemedicine consultations  at 1,  3, 6, [ADDRESS_932948] of surveys, specimen collection, and telemedicine consultation. Those 
assigned to the control condition (n=120)  will b e referred to a publicly available website that 
geolocates the nearest PrEP provider,  www.PrEPLocator.org . Both conditions will have identical  
TFV-DP kit collection for primary  outcome assessments (6 and 12 months) and app- based  
surveys  for secondary outcomes  assessments  across all study periods (baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months).  
 
The three study sites will be staffed by  [CONTACT_30223] s who will conduct telemedicine consultations  and 
supporting staff who will address participant care needs such as referrals for treatment. Study  
recruitment , retention communication, and tracking will be handled by [CONTACT_687843].  
 3.1  Study Population 
A total of 240 young MSM (aged 18- 29) will be enrolled and randomized into the study.  All 
participants , at the time of screening,  must live in one of the four study site states ( AL, GA, MS, 
NC). The study will target enrollment of 50%  Black or Latino MSM.   
 
3.2 Sample Size  
240 total participants, with 120 assigned to in tervention and 120 assigned to c ontrol . 
 
3.3 Study Randomization and Stratification  
An electronic data capture system  (EDC)  will be used to stratify  randomization by [CONTACT_687844] I error [11] due to the expected association between covariates and study 
outcome. Randomization will be accomplished within the study data management platform; within 
each stratum, the data system will produce a sequential block randomization list. This list will 
automatically populate the appropriate study arm assignment in iDataFax  at the time each new 
participant is randomized at any of the three study sites.

performed. The consent form will only be available in English. Informed consent verification will 
be completed over the phone with study staff prior to baseline visit procedures. Timeline for  
consent is contingent on the timeline of study activities as described in section 5.1.   Participant s 
will be asked to sign a new consent if activities are not completed within the specified timeline.  
5.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1 Enrollment Procedures  
There will be two  stages of eligibility assessment: screening (including behavioral assessment 
screening ) and clinical eligibility screening in which the study clinician determines whether the 
participant is eligible to take PrEP. Each procedure below must  be completed prior to moving to 
the next procedure.   
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 14 of 34 
 1. Participants who respond to an electronic ad will complete a brief  online consent for 
screening. (Section 4. 5)  
2. Participants will complete screening (the first stage of eligibility ) and if eligible will 
complete a full study consent  (Sections 4.4 and 4.5) .  
3. Participant s will be called to verify eligibility and consent.  
4. Participants may be scheduled to consult with clinician regarding HIV risk and PrEP 
eligibility.  
5. Participants will be given instructi ons t o download the study  app (through GooglePlay or 
Apple Store) , and create a personal account  for the app on their mobile devices.  
(Section 5.4)  
6. Staff will affirm non- fraudulent participation by [CONTACT_687848].  
7. Staff will notify  participants to complete the Baseline survey  through the app . 
8. Staff will send participants a home test kit to self -collect specimens  and return them via 
mailer.  (Section 5.5 ) 
9. Staff will check state immunization records for Hepatitis B or refer participants to testing. 
10. Participants determined to be behaviorally and clinically eligible for the clinical trial will 
be enrolled and randomiz ed. (Section 5.3) 
 
Participants must complete enrollment procedures according to the following schedule. If 
activities are not completed by [CONTACT_687849], participants will be asked to repeat the 
appropriate previous step. Participants should download the app within [ADDRESS_932953]  kit within 4 weeks. Lab results will be returned within 2 weeks after the kits 
are received by [CONTACT_1758]. The maximum  time for enrollment procedures, that does not trigger 
repeat of some study steps, is 8 weeks prior to randomization.  
5.2 Locator/Contact [CONTACT_225506], designated site study staff will verify the c ontact information  the 
particip ant provided in the behavioral eligibility screener . Information to be verified will include  the 
already provided working phone number(s)  and valid email address(es ). Additionally, participants 
will provide  valid contact [CONTACT_687850], which may include family 
member s and/or friends who can be called in the event the participant cannot be reached by 
[CONTACT_61529]. We will also record whether participants are willing or not willing to receive  voice 
and text messages  using  the c ontact information provided. Study staff will not leave messages 
unless expressly permitted to do so by [CONTACT_2299] . If permission is given to leave messages, 
site staff will assure participants that messages left with a family member or friend will only ask 
the participant to contact [CONTACT_687851].  
The contact [CONTACT_687852], separate from 
study records  where able, with access limited to designated site research personnel. Site staff 
will maintain contact [CONTACT_687853]-based platform retention and scheduling 
database.  
 
For potential participants that provide contact [CONTACT_3031], but do  not download the app, we will 
maintain a database for follow up .

5.3 Randomization Procedures  
Upon completion of all eligibility assessments (online behavioral screening , baseline survey and 
clinical), p articipants will be randomized to either intervention (ePrEP, n= 120) or control (standard 
of care, n= 120). Participants will be randomized using iDataFax . Randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_3885] ( AL, GA, MS, NC) to decrease the likelihood of Type I error due to the expected 
association between covariates and study outcome.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_932954] s the study 
app and management portals, allowing for a single database to populate information across these study interfaces.  Laboratory testing is accompli shed through ‘home test kits’ consist ing of 
instructions and materials to allow participants to self -collec t specimens and return them to a 
central  laboratory for appropriate testing. The intervention fully complies  with the standard of care 
PrEP provision practices outlined in t he CDC/US Public Health Service guidance. [12] 
 
Study App: 
The study app , eP,  serves  as the primary participant -facing component of the intervention. The 
eP app, which will be  downloaded on participants’ phones, includes many features to facilitate 
remote care. Electronic messaging  features provide a means for participants to communicate with 
their clinical care team  through secure messages , or send documentation needed for PrEP 
navigation through secure photos . Surveys are hosted in the app, and used to populate key forms 
and answer key clinical questions such as medication adherence. Automated n otifications of 
progr ess and appointment reminders  are sent, seeking to facilitate engagement in care. A  
timeline -based view  show s progress in care, and next steps such as upcoming virtual visits or 
home test kits to be completed. Telemedicine consultations with study clinicians will occur within 
the app through secure video, and s cheduling of these  consultations  will be accomplished through 
a calendaring function . A preferences function will allow participants to alter their profile such as 
changing preferred pharmacy or home shippi[INVESTIGATOR_13386]. Some of the app features, particularly 
messaging and survey functionalities, will also be used to incorporate components of interaction 
that are specific to research study participation. The app is  hosted in a secure environment, 
compliant with all relevant security protocols , and will use password protected entry to enhance 
privacy . (Section 7.3.4)  
 
The eP app has two versions: one for the intervention group and one for the control group.  When 
participants first download the app, they will only be able to see the initial parts of the app needed 
for study initiation: baseline survey modules and home test  kit tracking. Once the participant is 
randomized, their version of the app will open up to show them the timeline of the study vi sits 
information based on the group they are assigned.  The intervention group will be able to see and use all components of the eP app.  The control group will only be able to see the parts of the app 
that are applicable to research: surveys , tracking home  test specimens ( the mail- in DBS card for 
TFV-DP), and  messaging functionality for  communicat ion with study staff.  
 
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 16 of 34 
 Management portals : 
 Administrator portal: Stud y staff will manage participant interactions through a web- based  
interface  that exchanges data directly with the eP app. Study staff will use the participant 
management system  to securely exchange  message s with participants using the eP app. 
The participant management system  will have a dashboard to manage and track participant 
completion of study -related activities, such as survey completion or scheduling of 
telemedicine consultations . 
 Clinician  portal : Clinicians will view clinically -relevant  participant information in a web- based 
interface that exchanges data with the administrator interface and the eP app. Participant 
information viewable to clinicians will include lab results  and participant self -reports of sexual 
behavior , PrEP adherence, and PrEP side effects. A calendaring function will be used by 
[CONTACT_687854] e time slots available for telemedicine consultations  so that participants can 
schedule through the eP app. Telemedicine consultation d ata, including clinician notes , will 
be collected in the clinician interface for each telemedicine consultation.  
 
Home Test Kit:  
ePrEP will use  a mail- based specimen self-collection system that has previously been pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-
tested .[16] Participants will receive a plain box vi a standard mail  that includes instructions and 
materials for each specimen to be collected. Participants will be provided with video and written 
instructions as well as a call-in help line for the home collection system  (during business hours) . 
After specimen collection , participants will enclose them in a prepaid mailer to be sent directly to 
the lab. Testing of all specimens will be performed at CLIA -certified l aborator ies using  FDA-
approved tests. (Section 5.5)   
 
Telemedicine: 
The eP  app includes a secure video component that will allow for study telemedicine consultations 
between study clinicians and participants. This will allow study  clinicians to evaluate participants 
at standard, quarterly  prescribing intervals for PrEP. Participants may also ask questions of their 
study clinician using the eP secure messaging system.  
 
5.4.2  PrEP Initiation /Continuation 
If laboratory,  clinical and behavioral survey results do not show contraindications to PrEP 
initiation/continuation, the study clinician will initiate or renew the PrEP prescription. Eligible participants will be initiated with a 3- month prescription for FTC/TDF  or FTC/TAF by [CONTACT_687855]. Standard PrEP financial navigation servi ces will be delivered by [CONTACT_687856]. The navigation will use [COMPANY_009] medication 
assistance and co -pay access programs, in addition to state- specific programs, to facilitate 
access to PrEP at l ow or no cost to participants. We will seek to make home delivery of PrEP 
prescriptions from pharmacies  available . If a participant ’s insurance does not allow for the home 
delivery , participants will pi[INVESTIGATOR_687828]. Enrolled participants 
not on PrEP, due to discontinuation or never having initiated,  will continue participation in the 
scheduled research assessments.  With clinician guidance, such p articipants can choose to 
uptake PrEP at any point during the study . 
 
5.4.3  PrEP Discontinuation / Restart  
Regular study interactions include telemedicine consultation, surveys, and messaging with staff.  
If through any of these interactions a participant reports  a gap of  not taking PrEP for ≥[ADDRESS_932955] 6 months . Reasons for discontinuing or restarting will be captured. 
 
5.4.4  Research Staff Training  
Study staff and clinicians will complete HSP and GCP training. Staff will be trained on using the 
ePrEP web -based portal for participant management, and on eP app functionality.  Study clinicians 
will discuss case scenarios for PrEP patients  for more standardized approaches to specific 
scenarios seen by [CONTACT_687857] .   
 
5.4.5  Interv ention Monitoring/Quality Control  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287491], will ensure that 
protocols and procedures are followed, all adverse event reports are reviewed (if any), 
confidentiality procedures are implemented, and the UNC IRB is alerted if unexpected concerns 
arise.  The study may also be subject to a quality assurance audit by [CONTACT_154986], 
as well as inspection by [CONTACT_4708] .  
 
5.[ADDRESS_932956] whole blood in microtubes from finger prick  for creatinine and syphilis  
(using antibody test with reflexive RPR)  tests. Whole blood collected on dried  blood spot (DBS) 
cards will be used for HIV testing. Pharyngeal swabs, rectal swabs and a urine sample will be 
collected for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing.  Hepatitis B surface antigen will be tested either 
through Quest/LabCorp, local health department,  or self -collect.  Participants may be referred to 
local testing services , if needed. The Alabama Department of Public Health, Georgia Department 
of Public Health, Mississippi [INVESTIGATOR_687829] , and the North Carolina Department of 
Health and Human  Services  will be notified of confirmed positive results in accordance with state 
public health reporting laws, a procedure that will be explained to participants at consent.  
 
Baseline testing:  All participants will be tested for HIV, syphilis , creatinine,  gonorrhea , chlamydia, 
and Hepatitis B . 
 
Follow -up testing:  Intervention participants will be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and 
chlamydia quarterly.  Creatinine will be tested at months [ADDRESS_932957]  will undergo confirmatory testing per established 
protocols  on DBS specimens . If confirmed,  results will be returned to participants by [CONTACT_687858].  
 
 
5.5.2  STI Testing 
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 18 of 34 
 All participants will be tested for syphilis and pharyngeal, urethral, and rectal gonorrhea and 
chlamydia at Baseline.  Intervention participants will be tested for syphilis  gonorrhea, and 
chlamydia (pharyngeal, urethral and rectal) at quarterly follow -up virtual visits . Reflexive RPR titer 
will be conducted if the syphilis antibody test is reactive.  Hepatitis B surface antigen will be tested 
to determine chronic hepatitis B status at Baseline.  
 
5.5.3  Safety Labs  
Creatinine will be checked at B aseline, in order to calculate creatinine clearance for eligibility 
determination. Creatinine testing will be repeated at months 3 and 9 in accordance with CDC 
guidance. Creatinine will be tested from participant self -collected whole blood specimens using a 
point -of-care machine. C reatinine clearance will be calculated using the Cockcroft -Gault equation, 
with participant’s self-reported weight at baseline.  If creatinine clearance <60 ml/min on follow -up 
testing, the prescribing physician will make an assessment and recommendation regarding 
whether the participant will need repeat testing and/or temporary or permanent discontinuation of 
PrEP.  
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_932958] and dried for ≥ 4 hours 
prior to mailing. Once returned to the lab, the primary outcome assessment DBS specimens will 
be stored in a laboratory  freezer at -20˚C until they are batch tested for TFV -DP levels at the UNC 
Kashuba Lab. The Kashuba Laboratory will also measure emtricitabine- triphosphate (FTC -TP) 
from the DBS cards for secondary analyses .  
 
 
5.5.5  Referrals  
In the case of an initial ( 4th gen) positive HIV test  done through the study, participants will be 
instructed to discontinue PrEP dosing. P articipants testing positive will be referred for study -
provided HIV confirmatory testing. Upon receipt of positive HIV confirmatory test results, the 
linkage to care process will be initiated within two business days . For changes in creatinine 
clearance, study clinician s will consider discontinuing PrEP for any participants with calculated 
creatinine clearance below 60 ml/min. As needed, the linkage to care process for low creatinine results will be initiated within two business days. For positive STI tests, participants will have PrEP 
prescriptions initiated or renewed, and be referred to STI treatment at a local agency. Site study 
staff will follow -up with participants testing positive for STI to encourage participants to seek  
appropriate care.  Laboratory  test results will be provided to participant providers if requested and 
authorized to release.

MEASURES   
6.1 Behavioral Measures  
 Pre-entry or screening measures  
• Screener for Behavioral Eligibility: The screener asks basic demographic questions and 
behavioral eligibility questions.  
 
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 19 of 34 
 6.1.2  Pre-intervention (baseline) measures  
• Baseline Survey: The baseline survey will include questions in the domains of 
demographic s, sexual history, potential correlates of initiating and maintaining in PrEP 
care, mental health, and stigma. To continue to be eligible for randomization, all survey 
modules must  be completed within a week of starting the first module. After completing 
the baseline survey (and if clinically eligible) participant will be randomized into control or 
intervention arm.  
 
6.1.3  On-Study measures  
• 1- Month CRF: Intervention participants will have a telemedicine consultation with study 
staff or clinician  to assess experiences one month after initiating PrEP. CRF will record  
adherence and side effects.  
• Survey s for participants in both arms  at months 3, 6, 9 and 12: categories include s exual 
behavior, PrEP cascade, and the validated system usabilit y scale (SUS) .  
 
6.1.4  Premature Discontinuation/Off -Study measures  
Participants will  be asked to answer  several brief questions , to be recorded on a CRF,  
document ing reasons for study  withdrawal.  
 
6.2 Clinical and Laboratory Evaluations  
6.2.1  Baseline measures  
• Home Test Kit: HIV, and Creatinine tests will determine clinical eligibility for the study.  
 
6.2.2  On-Study measures  
• HIV: 4th generation HIV tests will be conducted using whole blood specimen. HIV testing 
will be conducted quarterly.  
• DBS: TFV-DP levels will be assessed  at months 6 and 12  to gain an understanding of 
participant adherence to their PrEP regime. These research outcome results will not be returned to the participants  or clinicians .  
  
7.0 DATA COLLECTION AND SITE  MONITORING  
 7.1 Development of Protocol and Case Report Forms  
The Protocol Team, in collaboration with the Management Core (MC)  and Analytic Core (AC), is 
responsible for the development of this protocol and the Case Report Forms (CRFs) needed to collect the information required to implement this protocol.  
 7.2 Data Records  
Participant -related study information will be identified through a study ID number ( SID) and 
participant code (participant first initial  and two- digit day of birth) on all participant CRFs and 
survey data.  SID will be used wherever  possible  in place of personally -identifying information.  
ATN [ADDRESS_932959].   
SIDs will not be entered into the mobile app and instead a unique app ID will be assigned to each 
participant and used when logging into the app. These unique App IDs will be provided by [CONTACT_175971]. Participant locator/contact [CONTACT_687859] -based 
interface  (Section 7.3.4).  
 7.[ADDRESS_932960] effects, will 
be collected on CRFs. CRFs will be completed electronically through iDataFax.  All CRFs  will be 
distributed to study s taff through  iDataFax . 
 
7.3.2  Electronic Surveys  
Self-administered surveys at Baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 month virtual visits  will be completed by 
[CONTACT_687860] a secure electronic platform . Data 
collected using electronic surveys will remain confidential and be stored on a secure electronic 
platform , accessed by  [CONTACT_687861] ( API) to populate the eP app and 
administrative portals . The platform API [INVESTIGATOR_687830]’s on their personal devices.  SID will be used in order to link the interview responses to the 
participant’s CRF data.   
The survey will be an embedded webpage, hosted on the study’s electronic survey platform, 
which  appears to participants to be a seamless component of the eP app.  The survey will  be split 
into multiple modules to ease participant burden imposed by [CONTACT_687862].  
 7.3.[ADDRESS_932961], authorized users will be granted unique login names and 
passwords to access survey data on the survey platform servers. To ensure data privacy, as soon 
as data is entered (in real -time), it will be encrypted during transmission to the Adolescent 
Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions  (ATN) Analytic Core ( AC) using Secure 
Socket Layer (SSL) technology. When downl oaded, t he data is stored in a secure database on 
an AC server within the AC data center.  SSL encryption will be used for transfers of information 
online and data will be stored in the secure, HIPAA -compliant servers of SurveyGizmo. The 
Emory AC team maintains a business partner HIP AA agreement with SurveyGizmo.   
 
Participant management system data security  
The ePrEP participant management system has two components: a back -end “office ” that is an  
interface for administrators and clinicians to manage participants and store data, and a 
participant -facing mobile app called eP.  Emory University holds Business Associate Agreements 
(BAA) with all components interacting with the app and hosting servers including Microsoft Azure, 
Zoom, and SurveyGizmo to ensure  HIPAA compliance.  
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 21 of 34 
 The back -end office participant management system, hosted in the cloud, interacts with a custom, 
secure API [INVESTIGATOR_687831]. It also interacts with a HIPAA -
compliant video conferencing service, Zoom. Both connections are over a secure connection. The 
cryptographic algorithm the ePrEP participant management system uses is the AES 256 
algorithm, with the key hardcoded on the server side. The system uses SSL to communicate with 
the API. The key size is 128 bits. The system only includes API [INVESTIGATOR_236984]; there is no other 
hard- coded information that exists within the system.  
Users and devices will be authenticated through the eP app  using form authentication through a 
unique user ID and password, or t hrough log in authentication  that uses ID and password settings 
from Facebook or Google. The app will provide no data to Facebook/Google, and vice versa; 
instead the app will simply use the Facebook/Google system to authenticate the appropriate user 
to allow for log- in to the eP app. Once an authentication system is established, the eP app wil l 
allow users to log in with TouchID  if it is enabled on their phone.  
All relevant compliance requirements are met by [CONTACT_687863], including HIPAA compliance, and 
security measures for personal health information including auto log out feature. All API’s fo r the 
eP application are HIPAA compliant. Sensitive data including participant’s demographic 
information (name, phone number, and email address) will be accessible in the application. The 
participant management system stores lab results as an encrypted database within the central 
Structured Queried Language (SQL) server that is secure and accessed only via authenticated 
administrators and clinicians. SQL is a programming language that manages data contained in 
relational database management systems. The lab results will not be stored in the participant 
mobile facing application.   
 
7.3.5 Zoom Platform Description  
For the telemedicine consultations  conducted through the eP  application, the  study will rely on 
the Zoom  platform. Zoom will be embedded into the eP app. P articipants will use it to 
communicate with their ATN site study clinician in face -to-face video chat,  and text based 
conversation. Our implementation of Zoom  is HIPAA -compliant , and Emory University has 
entered a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)  with Zoom . Zoom includes the following 
functions to protect users: End -to-End encryption, connects automatically using udp and tcp port 
8801, 8802, and 8804 or HTTPS (port 443/TLS) , encryption with the Advance Encryption 
Standard (AES) 256- bit algorithm. Session keys are generated with device unique hardware ID 
to avoid data being read from other devices.  This ensures that the consultation cannot  be 
eavesdropped or tampered with.

assignment)  and to record study milestones such as study  discontinuation , PrEP discontinuation 
and restarting, clinician decisions regarding PrEP, referrals, and adverse events (AE). AC staff 
will work with study investigators and the Management Core ( MC) to develop CRFs .  
7.4.[ADDRESS_932963] login , will be able to access and open the study surveys. 
To ensure data privacy, as soon as data is entered (in real- time), it will be encrypted during 
transmission to the AC using Secure Socket Layer technology.  The data will then be immediately 
stored in a secure database on an AC server within the AC data center.  
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_932964] adhere to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to 
protect research participants and produce reliable study information.  Sites participating in 
research sponsored by [CONTACT_112516] (QA) plan that will identify problems and correct errors in research study records.  
 7.[ADDRESS_932965] Availability  
Site monitors from the MC  and AC  may visit participating study sites to review a selected portion 
of the individual participant records, including consent forms, CRFs and supporting source 
document ation to ensure the protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol, and 
accurac y and completeness of records. Regulatory files, as required, will also be inspected to 
ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed.  
 
The site investigator will make study documents (e.g., consent forms, case report forms) and 
pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133737], the site 
monitors, the NICHD, the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), or the sponsor’s 
designee for confirmation of the study data.  
 
8.0 PARTICIPANT MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Tracking Participants / Follow -up 
All participants will be followed prospectively for 12 months  after assignment to the intervention 
or control conditions . Research assessments, completed at the participant’s home, will be 
identical for interv ention and control participants: surveys at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and  DBS 
specimen collection and mailing at 6 and 12 months. All participants will be reminded of their 
upcoming assessmen ts through the study app.  All participants will be followed up for study 
retention regardless of whether they are actively taking PrEP and/or engaged in PrEP care.  
ATN [ADDRESS_932966] a 1- month telemedicine consult with the ePrEP site study staff 
or clinician, providing an open forum to answer questions/concerns, assess side effects, 
adherence, behavioral risk, symptoms of acute HIV infection or STD, and provide appropriate 
clinical management. The intervention arm will have home test  lab assessments and telemedicine 
consultations  at 3, 6, [ADDRESS_932967] a set window period for the participant to complete. If a participant 
misses a virtual visit  or scheduled follow -up assessment, they will be allowed to continue in the 
study for the following virtual visits . They will remain on a 12-month study timeline.  
 
8.2 Compensation  
The study will compensate all participants  who complete baseline procedures  with $100. 
Participants will receive $50 for completing the baseline survey  and eligibility verification steps , 
and $[ADDRESS_932968] kit. Follow -up compensation will be $ 40 for electronic -
survey completion and $ 40 for DBS collection. Individuals who complete the eligibility screener 
may also receive up to $10.  Participants who refer individuals for the study can receive $10 
incentive for up to 5 referrals for a maximum of $50.  
 
8.3 Intervening on “Social Harms"  
All sites have specific policies governing the treatment of human subjects. These policies specify 
that medical and psychological assistance will be available in the event a participant should  
require further evaluation or treatment . Participants will be referred to a local clinic that is able to 
assist the participant further.  
While participants will be informed that they may refuse to answer any question at any time, responses or reactions to certain questions may indicate distress on the part of the participants.  If at any time during the study, a participant divulges that he or she is at risk for harm, including 
but not limited to being abused or experiencing violence, if harm is suspected or likely, or if the 
participant states he or she is suicidal/homicidal, measures will be taken to ensure his o r her 
safety. Reporting will be done as appropriate to the situation and the legal statutes, and referrals will be provided to appropriate support, counseling or treatment resources . 
 
8.[ADDRESS_932969] the reasons for all withdrawals. Early study discontinuation may occur for the following reasons:  
• Participant ha s a confirmed HIV -positive test  
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 24 of 34 
 • If the study is terminated prior to its  planned end date  
• If the study clinician or the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_687832]’s best interest to discontinue 
participation in the study  
• If a participant  threatens study staff  
Any unexpected adverse events that meet the new safety information reporting criteria will be 
immediately reported to the UNC -CH IRB and the respective sites’ IRBs if applicable. Study staff 
will complete a Study Stop form for participants who are discontinued. This form will include the 
date, last virtual visit  completed, and reason for  study  discontinuation.  
9.[ADDRESS_932970] study clinicians prescribing FDA -approved oral PrEP, in accordance with 
[COMPANY_009]’s label indications for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/ emtricitabine (Truvada)  or 
emtricitabine/ tenofovir  alafenamide (Descovy). The prescription of PrEP in the study will also 
follow guidance from the US Public Health Service and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study will not be providing study drug. Individuals will be getting prescribed 
medications from a local pharmacy. Side effects due to the medication will be monitored but not 
considered study -related adverse events.  
The frequency and severity of side effects from Truvada a nd Descovy are listed as follows (items 
in bold are from the  package insert):  
 
• Very Common (approximate incidence > 50%):  none 
• Common (approximate incidence > 25 - 50%):  none  
• Likely (approximate incidence of > 10 - 25%) and Mild to Moderate  (no disruption to 
temporary interference with daily activities; may include prescription intervention): 
nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, 
and rash.    
• Infrequent (approximate incidence of > 1 - 10%) and Mild to Moderate (temporary 
interference with daily activities; may include prescription intervention)  : diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, decrease in weight , generalized weakness, shortness of breath, 
increased cough, runny nose, allergic reaction, skin darkening of the palms of hands 
and/or soles of feet, muscle pain and weakness.   
• Rare (approximate incidence < 1%) and Severe to Life threatening: bone pain and 
bone changes, worsening or new kidney damage or failure, liver problems, increases in 
pancreatic enzyme, increased triglycerides, increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
which could mean muscle damage, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with 
steatosis that may result in liver failure  
 
Site staff must first follow their own IRB’s procedure for reporting and managing untoward effects.  
 There are t wo types of untoward effects to be identified:  (1) those related to the participant and  
(2) those related to the study staff . 
 
ATN [ADDRESS_932971] related to the participant.  All adverse events  
(AE) reported will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_687833], expectedness and relatedness. Reporting is required for occurrences including 
social harms, psychological distress and serious life- threatening events such as suicide attempts.  
These may be immediately apparent to the study staff, such as the participant’s emotional upset requiring referral for counseling; or they may be delayed and reported later to study staff, such as physical harm to an individual for having participated in the study. Study staff will notify the team 
of these untoward effects using the iTech Query and Notification System ( QNS ) accessible 
through the iTech  website ( https://itechnetwo rk.org
). 
 
Serious adverse events  (SAE)  will be adverse events that result in death, are life threatening, 
requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes disability, or poses other significant hazards. Severity 
of AEs will be classified as follows: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild AEs will be events that do 
not require medical attention and are easily tolerated. Moderate AEs will be events that require 
simple and routine medical treatment and may cause some interruption to daily life. SAEs will be 
defined as above. AEs will also be categorized as definitely, possibly, or not related to the study. 
AEs that are definitely related will follow a logical causal sequence from a study activity. Possibly 
related events will follow a logical causal sequence from a study activity but may also be due to non-study activities. Not related events will be events that do not follow a logical causal sequence 
from any study activity. All adverse events require reporting to the ATN  via the iTech Query 
system within [ADDRESS_932972] 
them. Training and guidance will seek  to minimize this risk. The protocol chairs should be notified 
of these events so that they may be immediately addressed, evaluated, and guidance modified 
or expanded to minimize similar risk to other staff.  
 
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC ) will receive standard data reports on a quarterly basis. The 
chair of the SMC  will lead biannual calls to discuss study progress, and convene additional SMC  
meetings as needed based on interim reporting. The SMC  will be tasked with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_687834], or if the inverse 
occurs.  We will conduct one interim analysis comparing the efficacy of the intervention in the 
active arm to the control arm, with efficacy based on differences in trial success versus failure 
using the primary outcome definition (detectable Tenofovir at 12 months). We will use the O’Brien-
Flemming spending function on the Z test statistic assuming a final alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_932973] study design  and supplements  to open the intervention arm.  The SMC  
will monitor several other factors, including HIV seroconversion, changes in kidney function, 
behavioral disinhibition, medication adherence, persistence in PrEP care, and differential loss to 
follow -up. 
 
10.0 STATISTICAL/ANALYTIC CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Introduction  
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 26 of 34 
 10.1.1 A total of 240 participants will be enrolled at baseline to account for a 20% expected loss 
to follow -up during 12 -months of study follow -up.  
10.1.2 Primary Outcome: Th e primary outcome  will be  detectable TFV -DP drug levels at the 
month [ADDRESS_932974] 
pharmacological models ,[17] TFV-DP level can be used to infer  the mean number of days per 
week PrEP is ingested over a time period of approximately 1- month preceding specimen 
collection. The cut point used for the primary outcome measure will be TFV -DP levels considered 
to be a surrogate for substantial HIV protection: >700 fmol/punch, a level indicating ≥  4 doses per 
week. The intervention efficacy measure will be quantified as the difference in proportions  of the 
intervention arm with this outcome compared to the control arm. For the power calculations , we 
will therefore use a two- sample comparison of proportions.  
10.1.3  Secondary Outcomes: Secondary outcome measures will be harmonized, to the extent 
possible,  with ATN measures. Safety/tolerance outcomes  will include: acute HIV symptoms , 
medication tolerance assessed based on side effects; adherence with number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_687835]; demographic, socio- economic, and sexual behavioral risk measures  derived from the 
National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) instrument and our previous research instruments; [10, 18]  PrEP perceptions and PrEP use adapted from the NHBS instrument as well 
as other sources;[10, 19]  commonl y used measures for depression;[20]  illicit and non -prescription 
drug use, [21] sexual stigma, [22] HIV severity and risk perceptions, [23] HIV knowledge,
[21] 
medication adherence self -efficacy, [24] the systems usability scale, [25, 26]  healthcare 
coverage,[27]  and use of social and geosocial networking sites.[27]  We will also seek to 
understand rationales for those who fail to persist in PrEP, assessing perceptions of PrEP barriers 
and concerns .[28, 29]  The Kashuba Laboratory may  also measure emtricitabine- triphosphate 
(FTC -TP), which will allow for additional study analyses regarding recency of PrEP dosing. [30] 
 
10.2 Power Estimates  
10.2.1  All analyses will assume 80% power to detect a difference at a two- sided 5% significance 
level. We will also assume a 20% attrition rate in both arms, with independent censoring. 
Assuming that  5% of participants in the control arm are above cut- point levels of the outcome 
measure (Section 10.1.2), we will have sufficient power to detect a minimum detectable effect size of 13% absolute difference in the outcome measure (e.g. ≥ 18% of participants in the 
intervention arm have outcome measures above the cut -point threshold). A sensitivity analysis 
determined that to allow for detection of a scenario where intervention outcome level = control+20% absolute increase, our study would remain sufficiently powered with any control 
participant uptake level ≤ 15%.  
 
10.3 Statistical Analysis Plan  
10.3.1 Aim 1: A nalyses of primary outcome that control for potential residual confounding, and 
analyses of secondary outcomes including initiation of and retention in PrEP care.  
Logistic regression and log- linear models will be used to estimate the association between 
intervention arm and the primary study outcome, TFV -DP level. If prognostic factors associated 
with the outcome remain insufficiently balanced through stratified randomization, we may adjust 
for these factors in our  models. Potential confounding factors that may be included are medication 
self-efficacy and motivation to take PrEP. Per protocol assessments that account for potential 
ATN [ADDRESS_932975] on the secondary outcomes of PrEP initiation and PrEP persistence will be determined using analogous regression models. Another secondary analysis will be to model log10  (TFV -DP levels)  as the outcome variable. An additional secondary analysis will 
account for changes in PrEP eligibility over time , per CDC guidelines. This has the potential to 
detect significant smaller “sub- clinical” differences in adherence between the intervention and  
control study arms. Similarly, an analysis with FTC- TP will allo w for a more sensitive and sub-
clinical assessment of PrEP use. Other specific and aggregate measures of safety including: 
renal function, HIV incidence, and incident bacterial STI  will be as sessed. 
 
10.3.2  Aim 2: Exploratory analyses of intervention effectiveness across subgroups, and analysis 
of potential mediators of initiation or persistence in PrEP care across both study arms, such as 
self-efficacy and urbanicity .  
Heterogeneity of the  intervention effects across subgroups  will be explored, including that of 
stratification (race ), and socioeconomic indicators. Understanding variables associated with 
success or failure in home care for PrEP will inform future research, and potentially guide clinician 
recommendations or policy regarding bringing PrEP to scale. For participants who seroconver t 
during the study, levels of TFV -DP, PrEP persistence, and other clinically -relevant study data will 
be analyzed.

accomplished by [CONTACT_687864] (the cost to the party implementing the program) and societal perspective (the payer costs plus the cost to the 
participant for participating in the program) to estimate the cost, cost -effectiveness, and cost -utility 
of the intervention relative to standard of care. Comprehensive cost analysis  will be conducted to 
assess the cost of developi[INVESTIGATOR_687836], using a micro -costing 
approach to estimate net costs . Cost -effectiv eness analyses will include calculating the 
incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER)  for the cost per HIV infection averted compared to 
standard of care as: [(Cost
Intervention  – Cost StandardofCare )] / [(Infections Averted Intervention  – Infections 
Averted StandardofCare )]. The health effect will be defined as the projected reduction in HIV infections  
over time associated with adopting the intervention relative to standard of care. The base, 
standard of care, model will estimate the number of infections expected in the absence of the 
intervention, and may vary under different assumptions of baseline and clinic -based PrEP 
coverage outside of the intervention. [33] In the cost -utility analysis, we will calculate the  cost per 
quality -adjusted life year (QALY) saved. QALYs saved by [CONTACT_687865] -to-
date estimates from the literature. S ensitivity a nalys es (varying levels of access, coverage, and 
adherence and exploring the impact of generic drug pricing, one of the major determinants of 
PrEP cost -effectiveness.[34] ) may be tested as unique intervention scenarios for the cost-
effectiveness and cost -utility analyses . 
 10.[ADDRESS_932977] step will be to assess the extent and pattern of missing data. If 
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 28 of 34 
 data are missing for only a few  cases, then data analysis will be conducted only on study 
participants with complete data. However, when such a strategy would result in loss of data from 
a substantial proportion of participants, or if this approach would lead to biased or inaccurate 
results, then some form of imputation may be performed  for secondary analyses . The form of 
imputation used will depend on the nature of the data that are missing.  
  
10.6 Qualitative  Data   
In-depth interviews (IDI):  In-depth interviews will be conducted after completion of [ADDRESS_932978] to sign a separate 
informed consent form and will be compensated $50 for their time.  Interviews will use a timeline, 
activity -based approach that uses data such as history of  PrEP use to prompt participant 
memories and create an interactive discussion between moderator and participant regarding 
PrEP care and care seeking experiences. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_22871]: (1) barriers and facilitators to PrEP 
care, (2) problems with and benefits of the ePrEP system or standard of care, (3) ways to address 
problems and amplify success of ePrEP or standard of care, and (4) factors that influence 
successful persistence in or fall- off from PrEP care. IDI’s will be conducted until data saturation 
has been reached. Purposive sampling of study participants will include up to 15 IDI with participants maintained in PrEP care as determined by [CONTACT_6270] -report of PrEP prescription (10 
intervention, 5 control) and up to 15 IDI with participants not maintained in PrEP care (10 
intervention, 5 control).  
 
 
Analysis of IDI:  Transcriptions and interviewer notes will be entered into a qualitative software to 
facilitate data management and analysis. Coding will be in line with the constant comparison analysis method, leveraging r eal-time identification of main themes, and exploring them in further 
depth among subsequent participants. Final analysis will compare data within and across codes and themes to answer study questions regarding ePrEP adaptation, scale- up considerations, and 
future research directions.  
  
11.0 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, ICH Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines, and 45 CFR Part 46.  
 11.1 Participants’ Confidentiality  
All laboratory specimens, questionnaires, surveys , and reports will be  identified by a coded 
identification number  and participant code in order to maintai n participant confidentiality.  
Participants will provide their names, mailing address and preferred contact [CONTACT_3031] (email 
or cell phone number for SMS) into the app which will be used when ordering CareKits . Study 
staff will confirm shippi[INVESTIGATOR_687837].  This personal 
information will be used only for the purposes of fulfilling the order, confirming participation in 
the study and returning lab testing results, and will be kept in a database with secure login 
requirements.  All records with personally -identifying information will be kept separate from 
study data when practicable. In some instances, such as interactions with study clinicians, 
participant identifying data will be available along with study data as needed. Access to these 
data will be limited  and role- based. Participant information will not be connected to identifying 
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 29 of 34 
 information  where possible.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission 
of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_687866] i n Section ( 7.7). 
To maximize privacy, the app’s mobile phone icon  is listed as “eP” . The app stores require a 
description of the app,  and we only provide vague information that will not reveal the purpose or 
topic of the study . The eP app is a shell for the secure, cloud- based hosting servers,  and will not 
store any data on the mobile device. All devices must be authenticated after completing the 
eligibility screener and before the participant can log into the app. The app requires secure log 
in each time i t is accessed.   
 
Analytic Core Role in Confidentiality  
Every effort  will be made to ensure that study participants are protected from risks. The main risk 
specific to the role of the Analytic Core is breach of confidentiality.  
Breach of Confidentiality: A potential risk to participants is violation of confidentiality. We will take 
the utmost caution to protect the confidentiality of all responses. We will minimize this risk by 
[CONTACT_687867] t all research procedures and data 
management and analysis. All Analytic Core research staff members are required to complete 
ethical clearance certification regarding protection of human subjects through UNC -CH or Emory 
University. We also have a strong data and safety monitoring plan in place to protect participants. 
Adverse events will be reported to the UNC -CH and Emory IRB, individual research PI [INVESTIGATOR_687838] -specific IRBs using Adverse Event Reporting Forms created by [CONTACT_687868]. Reports of serious adverse events will be sent within [ADDRESS_932979]- protected access to data. Therefore, we believe  
that this risk will be low.  
11.2 Minimizing risk to participants  
Every available step will be taken to minimize the risk of identifying/linking data being 
subpoenaed, stolen, or inadvertently released. Certificates of Confidentiality  are automatically 
issued by [CONTACT_18121], and will cover this study . All research staff members  will be  required to 
complete CITI ethical training  regarding protection of human subjects through their relevant IRBs. 
All studies will have documented procedures to safeguard against the risk of the linking 
information being stolen by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_687839] (http://citiprogram.org ) will have access.  
11.3 Risks and Benefits  
11.3.1  Risks  
Risks to participants in this research study may include:   
The measuremen ts that are involved in this study require finger prick  to collect blood samples. 
This procedure may cause local discomfort, bleeding, or bruising; rarely small clot or infection can 
ATN 159   Version 1. 7 dated 02-Apr-2020  
Page 30 of 34 
 occur at the blood draw site. This measurement should not be consid ered greater than minimal 
risk in and of itself given its routine use in general health care delivery.   
 
To minimize the risk of participants feeling uncomfortable about answering personal questions, 
we will use Computer Assisted Self Interview (CASI) methods for the study's surveys. In CASI, 
participants read survey questions on a mobile phone and use a combination of keyboard and 
touchscreen entry to input the answers themselves. In- depth interviews will be conducted through 
telephone or the eP app.  
To minimiz e risks to confidentiality, we will secure study data with all appropriate physical, 
electronic and operational protections. Data will be stored in a physically secure environment. All data files will have encryption and strong password protection. Any identifiable data will either be stored on Emory University's secure servers or will be on fully encrypted laptops. Electronic 
surveys and online eligibility screening will take place on an encrypted commercial survey website, SurveyGizmo (http://www.surveygi zmo.com/survey -software - features/secure -link/). 
This site has been used by [CONTACT_112532]. Access to data will be on a role- based standard; only those study staff 
who require access to each type of data to complete their study -related roles will be allowed 
access. All study staff will be trained in security and confidentiality procedures, and will sign a confidentiality agreement before receiving access to any participant data.  
Procedures will be developed to minimize indirect disclosure that a participant is participating in 
an HIV - related research study, or a study that enrolls MSM. Participants will be asked preferred 
method(s) of contact. No study -related messages will ever mention HIV prevention or the nature 
of the research study. Additionally, all scripts for email, text message, and telephone contact [CONTACT_687869].  
We use SSL encryption for transfers of information online, and SurveyGizmo has a business partner HIPAA agreement with Emory. SurveyGizmo’s servers are HIPAA compliant. Qualitative 
data analysis  will be conducted on a secure  software program (e.g. MaxQDA, Dedoose, Atlas.ti ). 
All study personnel names on this application have completed training and received certification in Human Subjects Research Protection (CITI Program) and HIPAA regulations. They will 
continue to renew this training in compliance with institutional polic ies.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_932980] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
This protocol, the informed consent documents and any subsequent modifications will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_687870].  The informed 
consent will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation.  Written informed consent will be obtained from the participant  through 
an electronic procedure.  The consent  form will be kept on fil e on secure servers, and a copy of 
the consent  form will be available for download by [CONTACT_2299].   
ATN [ADDRESS_932981] research and should NOT be considered by [CONTACT_146367]. Subjects enrolled who subsequently become incarcerated or are placed 
in detention will be study stopped. If incarceration is less than 3 months, they may be able to restart study activities.  Study visits cannot be conducted during the period of incarceration or 
detention.

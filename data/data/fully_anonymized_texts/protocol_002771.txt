changes   Global changes:
1. Subjects undergoing complex/combined procedures will not be prescreened or screened for antithrombin (A T) levels. The inclusion requirement 
for AT level less than 80% has been removed for complex/combined procedures (coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292] [CABG+valve], doubl e/triple valve 
repair/replacement, and ascending aorta/aortic arch surgeries ).
2. Only subject s undergoing isolated CABG or s ingle valve repair/replacements and not receiving preoperative heparin may be prescreened for AT 
levels (AT <80%). The inclusion criterion for isolated CABG or single valve repair replacement has been revised to allow incl usion based on 
either (a) AT level less than 80% OR (b) preoperative heparin administration (unfractionated heparin [UFH] for at least 12 hours ;low-molecular -
weight heparin [LMWH] for more than 5 days ).
3. To accommodate the above protocol modifications whic h no longer require local measurement of AT level for study entry for all subjects, the 
study drug dose calculation has been simplified  so that it is only based on the subject’s weight in order to achieve a poten tially therapeutic dose of  
blinded Antithr ombin III (Human) (AT -III [Human]).
Rationale:
The rationale to support these modifications in eligibility criteria is based on previous observational and published studies that report post heart 
surgery cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_707670] 30 -35% from baseline, which can be as high as 45 -50%. These prior 
studies were almost exclusively performed with low -risk patients undergoing isolated procedures with relatively short by[CONTACT_707671]. Our present study 
aims to enroll high -riskcardiac surgery patients defined as either undergoing combined/complex surgery in which higher by[CONTACT_707672] t reated 
with preoperative heparin and have a high -risk of arriving to the ICU with exceptionally low AT levels. Therefore, patients who will pr esent baseline 
ATlevels ≥80% may still be at risk of reaching the ICU with low  AT levels, which could put them at risk for adverse clinical outcomes. Ther efore, 
for complex/combined cardiac procedures (Inclusion #4) this amendment removes the requirement for AT level of less than 80%. How ever, for 
isolated CABG or single valve repair/replacements in order to qualify for entry, patients will be required to either have an AT level less than 80% or 
have received preoperative heparin (delineated above) .
Detailed changes are described below including modification in study drug dose calculation which is now dependent solely on subject’s weight and 
targeted to achieve an absolute increase (Δ) of 20% (percentage points) above pretreatment AT levels .

Every subject randomized to the AT -III (Human) treatment 
group will rec eive, immediately after anesthesia induction, 
a single dose of AT -III (Human) sufficient to achieve an 
ATlevel of 100% according the following formula:
4.1) ( ) 100() (kgin weight subject subjectin levelAT actualrequiredIU doseIII AT  Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of 
Administration :
Every subject randomized to the AT -III (Human) treatment 
group will receive, immediately after anesthesia induction, 
a single dose of AT -III (Human) sufficient to achieve an 
absolute increase (Δ) of 20% (percentage points) above 
pretreatment AT levels according tothe fol lowing formula:
4.1) ( ) 20() (kgin weight subjectrequiredIU doseIII AT 
The only variable in the equation is the subject’s body 
weight. For calculating AT -III (Human) dose, the subject’s 
weight obtained during the Screening visit will be used.Since the aim is to 
increase plasma AT 
levels by [CONTACT_707675] 20% 
(percentage points) 
above the pretreatment 
value for all subjects, 
the equation for dose 
calculation does not 
need to include the 
subject’s specific 
preoperative AT level 
because Target AT level 
–preoperative AT level 
is set at an absolute 
value of 20% 
(percentage points).
Therefore the dose 
calculation equation in 
the original protocol and 
previous amendments is 
simplified by [CONTACT_707676] a value of 20.

compared to more complex/combined procedures such as 
double/triple valve repair/replacement, ascending 
aorta/aortic arch surgeries, with normal baseline AT values, 
many subjects in the control group reached the ICU with
AT levels within the normal physiological range, 
suggesting that an AT supplementation may of more benefit 
in a higher risk patient population with lower baseline AT

Overall Study Description:
This study  will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study . Participating subjects will be 404 adult subjects undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery  
with CPB who will be randomized into 2 treatment groups preoperative ly in a 1:1 ratio: AT -
III (Human) treatment group and Placebo control group. All subjects will be stratified b y 
their previous history  of my ocardial infarction (MI). Subjects undergoing complex/combined 
procedures will not be prescreened or screened for AT levels (local lab) to assess eligibility . 
Only  subjects undergoing isolated c oronary  artery  by[CONTACT_9292] ( CABG )or single valve 
repair/replacements 
and not receiving preoperative heparin may be pre screened locall yfor
AT level s(AT < 80%).
Subjects randomi zed to AT -III (Human) treatment group will receive preoperative 
supplementation with AT- III (Human) designed to achieve an absolute increase () of 20% 
(percentage points) above pretreatment AT level s. Subjects randomized to Placebo control 
group will rece ive 0.9% Sodium Chloride (NaCl) for Injection, US P ([LOCATION_002] 
Pharmacopeia).
The maximum study  duration for a given subject will be approximately  7 weeks (48 day s). 
There will be 2 weeks for prescreening, screening, and randomization into one of the 2 study  
groups (AT -III [Human] treatment or Placebo control). After the [ADDRESS_961560] with the preoperative 
administration of AT -III (Human) or Placebo supplementation. After surgery , the subject will 
be admitted to the I CU and be followed for appr oximately  1 month (30±4 day s).
Both the primary  efficacy  endpoint (percentage of subjects with any  component of the major 
morbidity  composite) and the secondary  endpoints will be evaluated for each subject after

Brochure (IB) and an y additional data supplied by [CONTACT_78269].
1.1 Background
Cardiac surgery  interventions with cardiopulmonary  by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) lead to a sy stemic 
activation of the hemostatic and inflammatory  systems compromising the equilibrium of pro-
and anticoagulant factors. Excessive hemostatic activation due to exposure of blood to non-
endothelial extracorporeal surfaces, re -transfusion of shed pericardial blood, enhanced 
fibrinoly sis, and hemodilution often leads to a profound coagulopathological state 
predisposing patients to suffer both hemorrhagic and thromb otic complications during the 
perioperative and postoperative periods.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_707661], sy stemic 
thrombin generation is still prominent throughout and after CPB. ( 1, 2, 3) Bursts of thrombin 
and fibrin formation are observed immediatel y after CPB initiation and after reperfusion of 
the heart and lungs. 
(4) Moreover, continuous thrombin generation can be detected several 
days after surgery . Overall, these findings have been postulated to be related with the 
occurrence of postoperative ischemic events such as my ocardial infarctions, graft occlusions, 
ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism in addition to the procedure itself. (1)
Likewise, microvascular activation triggered b y inflammatory  mediators has also been 
suggested to contribute to organ function det erioration in the immediate postoperative period 
due to microvascular thrombosis. ( 5, 6)
Antithrombin (AT), an alpha 2 -glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 58,000, is the major 
plasma inhibitor of thrombin. AT is produced b y hepatocy tes and belongs to the SERine 
Protease Inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamil y and is composed by 432 amino acids. 
(7, 8) 
Inactivation of thrombin occurs by  [CONTACT_61172] a covalent bond resulting in an inactive 
1:1 stoichiometric complex making the thrombin active site inaccessible to its usual 
substrates. This bond involves an active serine of thrombin and
 an arginine reactive site on 
AT. ( 9)In the absence of heparin, complex formation occurs at a relativel y slow rate. 
However, when heparin or heparin sulfate on the endothelial wall is present, it binds to AT 
and dramatically  accelerates the rate of complex formation. (10, 11) In addition to thrombin 
inhibition, AT is also capable of inactivating several other ke
y coagulation proteases 
including factors IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa, and plasmin as well as display ing an array  of anti -
inflammatory  effects. ( 12, 13, 14, 15)
During cardiac operations with CPB the endogenous anticoagulant AT is diluted and 
extensively  consumed, therefore AT activity  at admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) has 
been reported to be significantly
 decrease d. (16, 17 , 18, 19, 20) Normal plasma AT 
concentrations range between 12.5 -
15 mg/dL, which translates to a normal range of the 
functional AT assay between 80% and 120%. ( 21) After cardiac surgery  with CPB a decrease 
of AT activit y of 40 -60% i s common and absolute values of AT activity  at admission to the 
Protocol GTI1307     Versio n: 4.0                                                                                                        02 Apr 2015

those observed in patients with congenital AT deficiency in which spontaneous venous 
thromboembolic events are described. 
(23, 24 ) Moreover, a consistent rate of coronary  
y patients reach the operation theatre with sub -normal AT values (70%±15%, p<0.05) du e to 
the preoperative use of unfractionated or low- molecular weight heparin (LMWH), advanced 
age or having suffered a recent m yocardial infarction. ( 25, 26, 27, 28) Patients presenting 
ng with low preoperative AT levels often demonstrate reduced he
parin responsiveness, 
sometimes leading to a heparin resistance pattern, defined as the inability  to achieve a target 
clotting time result after a standard dose of unfractionated heparin. (25, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33)
The safet y and efficacy  of the administration of purified AT concentrates for the 
management of heparin resistance has been consistently  demonstrated in both small studies 
and large phase III trials and is currentl y recommended by [CONTACT_232128] y of Thoracic Surgeons 
and Society  of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (STS -SCA) Guidelines on Blood 
Conservation Clinical Practice over the use of fresh frozen plasma. 
(34, 35, 36) The rationale 
behind this preference is based on the safer profile of AT concentrates with respect to 
infectious disease transmission, avoidance of hemodilution and transfusion -related 
complications such as volume overload and transfusion- related acute lung injury  (TRALI). 
(37)
The association of low AT levels and morbidity  has been established in inherited AT 
deficiency  and in certain situations of acquir ed AT deficiency  such as sepsis. These 
observations triggered the hy pothesis that lowered postoperative AT levels could influence 
the occurrence of postoperative complications after CPB. To this end, two large 
observational studies showed that patients wit h postoperative AT levels below 60% had 
greater risk of several negative outcomes during the I CU and postoperative period. 
(38, 39 ) 
Specificall y, the retrospective ob servational stud y by [CONTACT_707686]. demonstrated that low 
AT levels at the arrival to the I CU after cardiac operations was independently  associated with 
prolonged ICU stay , surgical re exploration, adverse neurologic outcome, and 
thromboembolic events. More over, ICU-AT activity  levels <58% was shown to be predictive 
for prolonged ICU stay  (>5 day s) with a sensitivity  of 67% and a specificity  of 83%. In this 
study , supplementary  exogenous AT was not provided to any  subjects to evaluate if the use 
of ICU-AT le vels is a predictable marker for poor postoperative outcomes. ( 38) These 
findings were later confirmed by  [CONTACT_707687]. which found that I CU-
AT levels below 
63.7% was independently associated with prolonged m echanical ventilation, need of 
inotropic support, postoperative bleeding, and blood product transfusion. (39) However, 
another observational study  failed to find a clear temporal correlation between baseline A
T 
activity  levels and the occurrence of postoperative major adverse cardiac events (MACE). 
(28)
In the light of these observations, a phase II randomized- controlled study  was carried out to 
investigate the effects of preoperative AT supplementation in maintaining postoperative AT 
levels within normal physiologic range, avoidance of heparin re
sistance, and limiting 
postoperative morbidity . (40) Patients in the treatment g roup were supplemented with a 
single dose of a plasma -derived AT concentrate immediately  after anesthesia induction 
aimed to achieve a target activity  level of 120% whereas control patients were given the 
Protocol GTI1307     Versio n: 4.[ADDRESS_961575] of care without the administration of AT. Preoperative supplementation of AT 
yielded significantly  higher AT activity  levels compared to untreated patients not only  at the 
ICU admission, but throughout the entire postoperative stay  until ICU discharge. Moreover, 
25 patients in the control gro up (26%) presented postoperative AT activity  levels below 58% 
whereas no patients in the treatment group (0%) reached the ICU with AT levels below this 
threshold. In addition, patients in the AT arm had a significantly  lower rate of heparin 
resistance and a trend towards fewer thromboembolic events. However, a higher 
postoperative bleeding rate (8 mL /hour) was observed in the treatment group, but was judged 
by [CONTACT_707688]. Conversel y, due to the lack of statistical 
power, differences in postoperative outcomes were unattainab le between study  groups.
Post-hoc anal ysis of the abovementioned study  confirmed previous observations that low 
postoperative AT levels (<58%) are a consistent predictor of prolonged ICU stay  (>7 day s) in 
untreated patients. Further, patients presenting ICU-AT levels below this threshold suffered 
overall worse postoperative outcome than patients that reached the ICU with AT levels above 
58% regardless of their treatment suggesting that prophylactic me asures to avoid such low 
AT levels after CPB are warranted. On the other hand, a similar pattern was observed in 
patients reaching the ICU with unexpectedly  high AT activity  levels. The latter were more 
prone to suffer bleeding- related postoperative compli cations suggesting that AT 
overcorrection should also be avoided and that a preoperative AT target of 120% may  be 
excessive . Moreover, given that this study  was performed with less complex procedures such 
as isolated CABG or single valve, compared to more complex/combined procedures such as 
double/triple valve repair/replacement, ascending aorta/aortic arch surgeries, with normal 
baseline AT values, many  subjects in the control group reached the I CU with AT levels 
within the normal phy siological range, sugg esting that an AT supplementation may  be of 
more benefit in a higher risk patient population (undergoing complex/combined cardiac 
surgeries with long b
ypass runs and/or high inflammatory response) prone to consume large 
amounts of AT or with lower baseline AT levels .
Overall these findings still do not clarify  if a pharmacological supplementation of AT aimed 
to avoid excessively  low and excessively  high postoperative AT levels is an effective 
therapeutic strategy  for the prevention of negative postoperative outcomes in patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery  with cardiopulmonary  by[CONTACT_6476].
1.[ADDRESS_961576] consistently  reported the association of low postoperative AT levels 
with poor clin ical outcomes ( 28, 38, 39) and that preoperative AT supplementation is able to 
o maintain AT levels within a normal range throughout the posto
perative period. (40 , 41) 
Conversel y, past studies have also highlighted the potential anticoagulant action of purified 
AT. ( 31, 34) Likewise, a dose dependent trend towards higher bleeding rates and a trend

(40, 41) The latter observations generate the h ypothesis that an AT supplementation strategy  
aimed to avoid both excessively  low (<58%) an d excessively  high (>100%) postoperative 
AT levels may  represent an effective therapeutic goal to ameliorate the occurrence of 
bleeding and thrombotic events, respectivel y. However, these assumptions have been derived 
from post -hoc analy sis and small studi es performed with a limited number of patients. 
(40, 
41)
Thus, this clinical study  has been designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of a 
preoperative treatment w ith AT supplementation (Antithrombin III [Human]) in subjects who 
undergo high
-risk cardiac surgery  with CPB targeting AT levels in such a way  to avoid both 
excessively  low and excessively  high postoperative AT activit y levels and to assess if 
management o f AT levels in this range may  decrease negative clinical outcomes during the 
ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] . The present clinical trial is intended to assess if directed preoperative 
AT supplementation will show favorable trends in decreasing the incidence of a com posite of 
major morb idity when compared to placebo.
Antithrombin III (Human) with the trade name [CONTACT_707714]®is marketed in several 
countries for replacement therap y in subjects with hereditary deficiency  of AT during 
pregnancy  or surgery , or if at r isk of thromboembolism. For simplicity , Antithrombin 
(Human) is abbreviated as AT- III (Human) in this protocol. Please refer to AT -III (Human) 
IB for additional detail.

3.1 Stud y Design and Plan
This study  will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, doub le-blind, placebo -controlled 
study . Participating subjects will be 404 adult subjects undergoing cardiac surgery  with CPB 
who will be randomized into two treatment groups preoperativel y in a 1:1 ratio: AT -III 
(Human) treatment group and Placebo control gro up. All subjects will be stratified b y their 
previous history  of MI. Subjects undergoing complex/combined procedures will not be 
prescreened or screened for AT levels using local lab values to asses seligibility .Only 
subjects undergoing isolated 
CABG or s ingle valve repair/replacements and not receiving 
preoperative heparin may beprescreened locall y forAT level s (must be AT < 80%).
Subjects randomized to AT- III (Human) treatment group will receive preoperative 
supplementation with AT- III (Human) designed to achieve an absolute increase () of 20 %
(percentage points) above pretreatment AT level s. Subjects randomized to Placebo control 
group will receive 0.9% Sodium Chloride (NaCl) for Injection, USP ([LOCATION_002] 
Pharmacopeia).
The maximum study  duration f or a given subject will be approximately  7 weeks (48 day s). 
There will be 2 weeks for prescreening andscreening, and randomization into one of the two 
study  groups (AT -III [Human] treatment or Placebo control). After the [ADDRESS_961577] with the preoperative

3.3 Treatments
3.3.1 Treatments to Be Administered
[IP_ADDRESS] AT-III (Human)
Detaile d information of AT -III (Human) is also available in the IB.
AT-III (Human), a freeze -dried preparation for intravenous (IV) administration, has AT as 
the active ingredient. I t is obtained from human plasma by  a continuous purification process, 
which is pe rformed in an authority -regulated plant in Clayton, North Carolina. Antithrombin 
is the main inhibitor of blood coagulation.
AT-III (Human) is prepared from pooled units of human plasma from normal donors by 
[CONTACT_707689] l method of Cohn. When reconstituted with 
sterile water for injection (SWFI), USP, AT- III (Human) has a pH of 6.0–7.5, a sodium 
content of 110 –210 mEq/L, a chloride content of 110 –210 mEq/L , an alanine content of 
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.0 02 Apr 2015
CONFIDENTIAL Page 43of 830.075 –0.125 M, and a heparin content of not more than 0.1 IU heparin/IU ATIII. AT- III 
(Human) contains no preservative and must be administered by  [CONTACT_2736].
AT-III (Human) preparation will be reconstituted in [ADDRESS_961583] deposits. Infusion of AT -III (Human) should be started within [ADDRESS_961584] never be kept for later use.
[IP_ADDRESS] Placebo
Placebo used in this study  will be 0.9% Sodium Chloride (NaCl) for Injection, USP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Labeling of Investigational Products
Investigational products will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and 
legislation. Label text will be approved according to agreed Grifols procedures, and a cop y of 
the labels will be made available to the study site.
Each vial of AT -III (Human) will be labeled with the antithrombin potency expressed in 
international units (IU) as defined b y the World Health Organization (WHO).
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage of Investigational Products
The investigational product should be stored at temperatures not to exceed 25°C (77°F). Do 
not freeze. The investigational product must be stored in a secure area accessible only  to the 
unblinded pharmacist, or designee, until dispensed for the stud y subject.
[IP_ADDRESS] Accountability for I nvestigational Products
Investigational product is to be used only  for the study  in accordance with the directions 
given in this protocol. The Investigator, or designee such as the stud y pharmacist, is 
responsible for the distribution of the investigationa l product in accordance with directions 
given in the protocol and pharmacy  manual.
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate records of the investigational 
product for his/her site. Investigational product inventory/dispensing documentation 
verify ing the receipt, dispensing, destruction, or return must be maintained and kept current 
by [CONTACT_93305]. The inventory  must be made available for inspection by  [CONTACT_36102]. I nvestigational product supplies (including placebo) must be acco unted for b y the 
monitor and inventory /dispensing logs must be verified by  [CONTACT_707690]. Written documentation of an y used and unused 
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.0 02 Apr 2015
CONFIDENTIAL Page 44of 83inventory  is required. At the end of the study , a copy  of the invent ory/dispensing log(s) will 
be retrieved b y the monitor and returned to Grifols Therapeutics Inc.
Any unused investigational product will be accounted for and returned to the Sponsor’s 
distributor. When required by  [CONTACT_11582], unused supplies may  be des troyed at the study  
site. The Investigator will ensure that such disposition does not expose subjects to risks from 
the investigational product. The Investigator and the Sponsor’s representative will maintain 
records of an y such alternate disposition to pe rmit accurate drug accountability .
3.3.2 Rationale for Selection of Doses/Timing of Investigational Products in the 
Study
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Doses
Every  subject allocated in the AT -III (Human) treatment group will receive, immediately 
after anesthesia induction, a single dose of AT -III (Human) sufficient to achieve an absolute 
increase (Δ) of 20 %(percentage points) above pretreatment AT level saccording to the 
formula :
4.1) ( ) 20() (kgin weight subjectrequiredIU doseIII AT 
The only  variable in the equation is the subject’s body  weight. For calculatin g AT -III 
(Human) dose, subject’s weight obtained during the Screening visit will be used. 
AT-III (Human) or Placebo (0.9% NaCl) will be prepared according to the volume calculated 
by [CONTACT_707691] y.
AT-III (Human) will not be administered postoperatively  unless the Investigator decides 
otherwise for clinical reasons (if this is the case, the subject will be excluded from the 
efficacy  anal ysis).
After the operation, all subjects will be admitted to the I CUand will be followed for 
approximately  [ADDRESS_961585] (see Section 3.6.2).
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study
The goal for dose selection is to avoid both low and high posto perative AT levels in treated 
subjects. In a previous study  using another AT product for the same indication 
(40), the 
preoperative AT target of 120% was explored. The results suggested that dosin
g of subjects 
with a preoperative AT target of 120% resulted in a large number of AT treated subjects 
reaching the ICU with high postoperative AT levels (>100%). These AT levels were 
associated with an overall worse postoperative outcome. To build on this study , a more 
conservative dosing scheme and the inclusion of more severe subjects (i.e.,undergoing 
complex/combined cardiac surgeries or subjects undergoing isolated procedures with low 
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.0 02 Apr 2015
CONFIDENTIAL Page 45of 83preoperative AT levels or treated with heparin preoperativel y) are intended to achi eve better 
efficacy  and safet y.
3.3.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Numbering
Within each study  site, subjects in the study  will receive a consecutive subject number. 
Subject numbers are generated beginning with the study  center number (3 digits, assigned by  
[CONTACT_456]) followed consecutively  with a unique number for each subject (4 digits, 
including leading zeros). For example, if the Investigator’s center number is 301, subject 
number will be 3010001, 3010002, 3010003, etc., in conse cutive order. Subject numbers, 
once assigned, will not be reused at an y center.
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization
Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: AT -III (Human) treatment 
group and Placebo control group. Subjects will be stratified by  [CONTACT_707692] (MI). Unblinded pharmacist or designee will obtain the treatment 
assignment based on a computer -generated randomization schedule. The randomization 
number will be assigned at Preoperative visit (Day  0) after all enrollm ent criteria are met.
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
To minimize the risk of unblinding, all subjects will receive the same total volume for all 
treatments with no visible differences in the external appearance of treatments, infusion bags 
will be covered with a non -transparent sleeve, and opaque IV tubing will be utilized.
The unblinded study  pharmacist, or designee, will prepare investigational product (i.e., 
AT-III [Human] and placebo) at each site. Monitoring of activated clotting time (ACT) for 
subject safet y can potentiall y unblind an investigator if performed immediately  before AND 
immediately  after IP administration. Thus, to avoid potential unblinding, investigators should 
restrain from monitoring ACT values immediately before AND immediately after IP 
administration. I ndividual ACT determinations before OR after IP administration is not 
considered as potentially  unblinding and is therefore permitted. However, if ACT monitoring 
is done prior to I P administration care must be taken to ensure blinded study  personnel are 
not unblinded. Grifols Clinical Trial Materials personnel and Grifols Pharmacovigilance 
personnel will have access or be privy to treatment assignments.
Emergency  unblinding instructions will be located in the Pharmacy  Manual (to be used onl y 
if required).
Investigators must not draw an
y blood samples for AT levels outside the requirements of the 
protocol. Results from protocol- specified AT, TAT, and F1+2 measurements will not be 
provided to the Investigator or blinded sponsor personnel in order to ensure maint enance of 
the treatment blind.
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.0 02 Apr 2015
CONFIDENTIAL Page 46of [IP_ADDRESS] Administration and Timing of Investigational Products for Each Subject
The dose of AT -III (Human) will be slowly  administered, at a maximum rate of 
0.1mL/kg/min (minute), intravenously . The initial rate will be 0.05 mL/kg/mi n during the 
first 5 minutes, accelerating to 0.1 mL /kg/min if tolerated. Intolerance (the inability to 
provide the subject one full dose) of an infusion due to allergic reactions and anaph ylactic 
symptoms may  require decreasing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_707663]. I n these 
instances, the following algorithm will be employ ed:
Severe reaction:   Stop infusion. I f symptoms subside, it will be at the phy sician’s discretion 
whether to restart the infusion. The infusion may  be restarted under careful nur sing 
monitoring at one -half the previous rate. Appropriate concomitant medication may  be given 
as directed b y the ph ysician based on the clinical evaluation.
Moderate reaction:   Stop the infusion until all sy mptoms resolve.  If resolution occurs in less 
than 30 minutes, the infusion may be restarted under careful nursing monitoring at one -half 
the previous infusion rate. Appropriate concomitant medication may  be given as directed by  
[CONTACT_707693].
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Compliance
Treatm ent compliance will be measured onl y in terms of the subject receiving an infusion of 
AT-III (Human) from the study  personnel. No other measure of treatment compliance will be 
employ ed.
Reasons for an y deviation from the administration of less than 100% of the investigational 
product dose as prepared by  [CONTACT_32335], or designee, must be recorded in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) and in the subject’s medical records.
3.[ADDRESS_961586] month (including transfusions of 
blood or an y blood -derived product) prior to the Screening visit must be recorded in the 
eCRF, including the trade or generic names of the medication, the dose, the route of 
administration, and the duration of the medi cation (frequency ).
3.4.1 Prior to Study Treatment
Subjects may  be on heparin or low -molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists if 
international normalized ratio (INR) <1.[ADDRESS_961587] 7 day s before surgery . Gly coprotein 
IIb/IIIa receptor blockers must be discontinued at least 24 hours before surgery .
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.0 02 Apr 2015
CONFIDENTIAL Page 47of 833.4.2 Concomitant Medications during th e Study
Concomitant administration of heparin, low -molecular weight heparin, coumadin, tranexamic 
acid, aminocaproic acid, desmopressin, and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) may  
be used in order to avoid thrombotic risk.
Details of an y concomitant medication must be recorded on the eCRF except for anesthesia 
related products, fluid replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a nd electrol yte supplementation.
In addition, products given at different doses on the same day  to manage and maintain vital 
functions (e.g. insul in, furosemide) will only  be recorded once on the eCRF and dosage will 
be reported as PRN (pro re nata).
In the event that an AE or suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) should occur, complete 
details of all concomitant medication will be reported to the s ponsor.

violations).
5.The occurrence of an AE, which in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_707665].
6.The subject is lost to follow -up.
7.Subject’s death.
8.Subjects with an occurrence of a concomitant disease, or an y medical condition which, 
either because of its severity  or duration or necessary  change in treatment, contravenes 
the condition of the study or puts the subject at unnecessary  risk or harm per Investigator 
discretion.
9.Subjects who develop an infection with HAV, HBV, HCV, B19V, or HIV during the 
study . A subject should be withdrawn if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_707666]/her phy sician, he/she 
develops an y of these viral infections.
10.Any event, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator impedes the subjec t’s participation in 
the study .
If the reason for earl y discontinuation is an AE, in so far as is possible, the subject will be 
followed- up until the even t resolves, or has been stabilized, and no further change is 
expected.
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF and in the subject's 
records.
A subject may  leave the study  at an y time for an y reason and will be permitted to do s o 
without penalty . Grifols Therapeutics, Inc. will be notified by  [CONTACT_270889] a subject 
terminates or is terminated from the study  early. The reason for earl y termination will be 
clearl y documented in the eCRF and reasonable efforts to perform stud y completion 
procedures will be made when appropriate. The Investigator can withdraw a subject from the 
clinical trial at an y time.

of the treatment or in which the treatment level has been established in bod y fluids or 
tissues; that follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; an d that is 
confirmed b y improvement on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_56220] (dechallenge), and 
reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (rechallenge).
-Probable : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the treatment; that follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; 
that is confirmed b y dechallenge; and that could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_707698] o f the subject’s clinical state.

of the treatment; that follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; 
but that could have been produced b y the subject’s clinical state or other modes of 
thera py administered to the subject.
-Doubtful/Unlikely
: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the treatment; that does not follow a known response pattern to the 
suspected treatment; but that could not be reasonably  explained by  [CONTACT_707699]’s clinical state.
-Unrelated : Any  event that do es not meet the criteria above.
The operational tool to decide the AE causal relationship is based on algorithms by  
[CONTACT_707700] -Lasagna and Naranjo ( 43, 44).
When an AE is classified, assessing casual relationship by  [CONTACT_093], as definitive, 
probable, possible, or doubtful/unlikely , the event will be defined as suspected ADR. When 
the causal relationship is labeled “Unrelated”, then it will be considere d that the AE is not 
imputable to the study  treatment and it is not a suspected ADR. For definition of AR, see 
Section 4.3.3.
Any AE experienced by  [CONTACT_707701]  0 will be labeled as Unrelated to the study  drug.
In addition, when a causal relationship between the study  treatment and the AE cannot be 
ruled out by  [CONTACT_737], it means that the AE cannot be labeled “Unrelated”; then, the 
Investig
ator will be asked to evaluate whether the AE is attributable only  to the study  
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.[ADDRESS_961604] or device related to any  dose 
should be considered suspected ADRs. The phrase “responses to a medicinal product or 
device” means that a causal relationship between a medicina l product or device and an AE is 
at least a reasonable possibility , that is, the relationship cannot be ruled out. I n the framework 
of this study , a suspected ADR with a causal relationship of “definite” will be named as AR. 
Adverse reactions are a subset of suspected ADR.
The sponsor is responsible for assessing the suspected ADR expectedness during the clinical 
trial.
4.3.4 Severity (Grade) of the Adverse Event
For an y AE or SAE, the severit y (grade) of an event must be assessed. The following 
guidance should b e used to determine event severity :
Mild : usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities. 
Subjects have transient symptoms; no treatment required other than non -prescription 
drugs.
Moderate : sufficientl y discomforting to i nterfere with (but may  not overtly prevent) 
normal activities. Subject was sy mptomatic and required treatment, but had no sequela.
Severe : prevents normal activities. Subject was incapable of work or usual activity ; 
treatment with prescription medication w as required and/or sequela were produced
Adverse event and suspected ADR severity  (intensity ) gradation must be distinguished from 
AE and suspected ADR seriousness gradation, which is defined according to event 
consequence. For example, a headache could b e mild, moderate, or severe but unusually  is 
serious in all these cases.
The investigator will be responsible for assessing the AE or suspected ADR severit y 
(intensity ) during the clinical trial, taking into account currentl y criteria detailed in this 
section.
4.3.[ADDRESS_961605], occurring at an y dose that fulfils one or more of the 
following:
results in death
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.0 02 Apr 2015
CONFIDENTIAL Page 67of 83is immediately  life-threatening (life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an 
event in which the subj ect was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more 
severe).
requires in- subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]*
results in per sistent or significant disability or incapacit y
is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
is an important medical event: important medical event in the definition of “serious” 
refers to those events which may  not be immediately  life-threatening, or result in death, 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but from medical and scientific judgment may  jeopardize the subject 
and/or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an eme rgency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Development of cancer or drug dependency  or drug abuse will normally  
be considered serious b y this criterion.
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142051] y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142052] 24 hours. 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_422340]:
-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142054].
-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142055] a routine procedure 
followed b y the center.
-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a survey  visit, annual phy sicals, or social reasons.
-Elective (pre -planned) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a pre -existing condition that had not 
worsened f rom Baseline (e.g. elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to start of 
the study ).
-Admissions not associated with an AE (e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142056]).
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. The term “severe” is used to 
describe the severit y of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relative minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is 
defined on subject/event outcome or action criter ia usually  associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severit y) is a medical term while
severit y is a subjective term.
According to the medical criteria, an AE, or a suspected ADR, can be classified as se rious, 
although it does not fulfill the conditions fixed in this section, if it is considered important 
from a medical point of view. The investigator is responsible for assessing the AE, or 
suspected ADR, seriousness during the clinical trial, taking into account currentl y criteria 
fixed in this section.
Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.[ADDRESS_961606] is considered “unexpected” if the nature, seriousness, severit y, or 
outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference information. The expectedness 
of an AR shall be determined by  [CONTACT_707702] t he reference document (ie, IB).
Events not listed for the particular drug under investigation in the IB are considered 
“unexpected” and those listed are considered “expected.” When new AE information is 
received, it is the sponsor’s responsibility  to determine whether the event is “unexpected” for 
investigational new drug (IND) safet y reporting purposes.
4.3.[ADDRESS_961607] has signed the informed consent form (ICF)
must be fully  recorded in the subject’s eCRF or SAE form. For example, a laboratory  test 
abnormality  considered clinically  relevant, eg, causing the subject to withdraw from the 
study , requiri ng treatment, causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by  [CONTACT_1275], should be reported as an AE. Each event must be adequatel y supported b y 
documentation as it appears in the subject’s medical or case file.
At each visit, AEs wi ll be elicited b y asking the individual a non -leading question such as 
“Do you feel different in way  since the last visit?” .Moreover, AE will also be collected 
through directl y observed events or spontaneously volunteered b y the subject. Clearl y related 
signs, s ymptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures should preferabl y be grouped together 
and recorded as a single diagnosis or s yndrome wherever possible. It is responsibility  of the 
Investigator to ensure that AEs are appropriatel y recorded.
The following variables must to be recorded on the AE eCRF entry :
1.the verbatim term (a diagnosis is preferred)
2.date/time of onset
3.date/time of resolution
4.intensity  (mild, moderate, severe)
5.causality  (unrelated, doubtful/unlikely , possible, probable, definite)*
6.seriousness (y es, no)
7.action taken (with regard to study  drug)
8.other action (to treat the event)
9.outcome and sequel (follow -up on AE)
*Causality  assessment will be only  made when the AE occurs after the subject has 
received one or another study  treatment. AE occur ring before subject's exposure to 
study  treatments will be alway s labeled as "Unrelated".

In addition to the I nvestigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encoded by  [CONTACT_103] (or designee, eg, CRO) according to the MedDRA® dictionary  of medical codes.
A pregnancy  not verif ied before randomization but occurring during the course of the study  
will be not considered an AE, unless a relation to the study  drug is suspected. I n any  case, 
must be completed a Pregnancy  Report Form and send as soon as possible to the Sponsor, 
and the study  treatment must be discontinued. A copy  of the form should be filled at the 
study  site for follow -up until the end of the pregnancy .

signed, and dated SAE Report Form within [ADDRESS_961610] be also supplied to the Sponsor in a timely  manner (within 3 day s from its identification 
or within 24 hours for relevant new information) by [CONTACT_707703] b y 
other appropriate means, such as data clarification form issued by [CONTACT_707704]. In 
addition, the Sponsor or CRO may  request additional information and/or reports.
All SAE Re port Forms must be reported to:
Grifols Global Drug Safety
Serious adverse events will be assessed b y the Sponsor or designee for expectedness 
assuming tha t all subjects have been treated with AT -III. If the event is considered serious, 
suspected potentially related to the study drug and unexpected (S[LOCATION_003]R), then the treatment 
allocation will be unblinded. The following possibilities resulting from the unblin ding will be 
considered:

Protocol GTI1307     Version: 4.[ADDRESS_961611] will be 
reassessed for expectedness according to the reference safety information and:
a.If the suspected ADR is still considered unexpected, it will be reported in accordance 
with applicable requirements and guidelines.
b.If the suspected ADR is considered expected, it will not be reportable on an expedited 
basis, unless specificall y requested b y local regulations.
4.4.2 Reporting Pregnancy
While pregnancy  itself is not a true “AE,” pregnancy  occurring in a clinical study  must be 
followed, to collect information regarding the experiences of gestation and pregnancy  with 
investigational product exposure. The I nvestigator must report any  pregnancy  that occurs in a 
study  subject subsequent to informed consent until [ADDRESS_961612] be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the Investigator or study  
personnel’s first knowledge.

Assuming that percentage of subjects with major morbidity  composite is 22.0% in Placebo 
group and 14.3% in AT -III treatment group (ie, AT -
III treatment group has a 35% relative 
reduction comparing to the Placebo control group), 192 subjects per treatment arm (total 
384subjects) are needed to have 70% power to detect a trend at alpha = 0.15. Considering 
5% dropout rate, it is estimated that 404 subjects ([ADDRESS_961616] s per treatme nt arm) need to be 
randomized.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 83of 83aSubjects undergoing complex/combined procedures w ill not be prescreened or screened for AT levels. Only applicable for subjec ts undergoing isolated 
CABG or single valve repair/replacements who will not be recei ving preoperative heparin (see entry criteria) and whose eligibility will therefore be based on 
AT level < 80%. If it is logistically feasible, Prescreening visit must be performed prior to Screening visit, unless a subje ct’s surgery is scheduled to occur in 
≤ [ADDRESS_961630] be recorded 
on specific Prescreening sheets.
bRandomization may occur 24 hours before the day of surgery (Day 0).
cBaseline AT activity levels (hematology lab): Prescreening and Screening visits ( -14 days) .. Subjects undergoing isolated CABG or single valve 
repair/replacements will be prescreened for AT levels (AT <80 %
)if they are not receiving preoperative hepari n(see entry criteria) .These AT activity level s
will be measured locally at the investigator site. The AT (local lab) determination at the Screening visits will not be required if the Prescreening visit is 
conducted. All further AT determinations will be assessed at a central lab. AT activity levels will be measured immediately before and after infusion of AT -
III (Human) or Placebo at Operative visit (Day 0).
dHem oglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, aPTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen, TAT, and F1+2.
eHem atocrit only (local lab).
fCreatinine, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, BUN, LDH, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium.
gAn appropriate volume of blood will be draw n in order to obtain a serum/plasma retention sample. The retention s ample w ill be frozen and stored at -70ºC 
and stored in the event that additional testing is required in the future for purposes of this study only (i.e. repeat testin g, or confirmation of virology results). 
Viral nucleic acid testing (NAT) and viral serology testing will be performed only if the subject exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of viral infection 
during the one month follow -up period.
hType of surgical procedure, duration of CPB and aortic clamp, and transfusion requirements.
iChest- drain blood lo ss in the first 1 2 and 24 hours postoperatively.
jPostoperative clinical outcomes (major morbidity composite, transfusion requirements, surgical reexploration, low  cardiac syn drom e, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, acute kidney injury, arterial or venous thro mboembolic events, infections, and postoperative mortality) and chest -drain blood loss in the first 12 and 
24 hours postoperatively.

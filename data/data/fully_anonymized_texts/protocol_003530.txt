Title of Trial: A Phase III, Open -Label, Extension Trial of ECU -NMO -301 to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 
Eculizumab in Patients with Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)  
Trial center(s): Approximately 80 centers in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia -Pacific.  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_349580]: A list containing all Investigators will be provided when site selection is completed . 
Studied period (years):  
Actual  date first patient enrolled: [ADDRESS_865688] patient completed:  30 Jun 2020  Phase of development: 3 
 
Objectives :  
Primary:  
• Evaluate the long -term safety of eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO.  
Secondary : 
• Evaluate the long -term efficacy of eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO as measured by 
[CONTACT_646621] (ARR)  
• Evaluate long -term efficacy of eculizumab by [CONTACT_389342]:  
• Disability  
• Quality of life (QOL)  
• Neurologic functions  
• Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of eculizumab in relapsing NMO 
patients.  
Methodology:  
This is an open -label trial. All NMO or NMO Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) patients who have completed the 
double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled ECU -NMO -301 (PREVENT) trial may be eligible to participate in 
this extension trial. Prior to initiating any extension trial procedures, an inf ormed consent form must be signed and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria must be obtained, evaluated, and met. Throughout this protocol , the term NMO refers to 
both NMO and NMOSD.  
 
Patients who exit the ECU -NMO -[ADDRESS_865689] extension trial visit once the Week 6 
Follow -up Relapse Evaluation Visit is completed and no later than 2 weeks (14 days ±2 days) after the last 
investigational product ( IP) dose;  patients who exit the ECU -NMO- [ADDRESS_865690] extension trial visit once the End of Study  (EOS) Visit is completed  and no later than 2 weeks (14 days ±2 
days) after the last IP administration in the ECU -NMO -[ADDRESS_865691] been unblinded in ECU -NMO -
301 may not continue in ECU -NMO -302. 
 
Blind Induction Phase (Visits 1 – 4) 
To preserve the blinded nature of ECU -NMO -[ADDRESS_865692] undergo a blind induction phase prior to 
entering the open -label phase of this trial ( ie, all patients will receive 4 vials of blinded IP weekly for 4 doses ). 
Patients who were randomized to the placebo arm in the ECU -NMO -301 trial will start with the induction dose  (ie, 
they will receive blinded IP [3 vials/900 mg ec ulizumab plus 1 vial placebo ] at Visits 1 to 4 ). Patients who were 
randomized to the eculizumab arm in the ECU -NMO -301 trial will continue  with the maintenance dose ( ie, they 
will receive blinded IP [4 vials /1200 mg eculizumab every 2 weeks (±2  days)  at Visits 1 and 3 and 4 vials of 
placebo at Visits 2 and 4 ]). All patients will receive 4 vials/[ADDRESS_865693] 
throughout the trial.

Open- Label Maintenance Phase  
All patients will receive open- label  eculizumab (4 vials/1200 mg) every [ADDRESS_865694] be present at the trial site , as applicable per Schedule of Assessments , for visit- specific 
procedures/assessments including IP administration. For other visits, patients may have an  opportunity to receive IP 
administration remotely at a medical facility that is located near the patient’s home or at the patient’s home with the 
permission of the Principal Investigator  (PI) and in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or r egulations 
of the pertinent regulatory authorities. These visits will be conducted by a qualified staff member from the medical facility near the patient’s home or by [CONTACT_233553] -care health professionals who are under the  supervision of the 
Investigator. The tri al medication will be prepared and administered at the patient’s home  or at the medical facility . 
During a remote dosing visit, information on adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and signs or symptoms of NMO relapses will be collected and sent t o the Investigator’s site for evaluation on the day of the 
visit. Patients must go to the trial site for evaluation if the patient reports any signs or symptoms that suggest a serious adverse event  (SAE) or NMO relapse.  
 Supportive immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for relapse prevention  is allowed during this  extension trial at the 
Treating Physician’s discretion . Change in IST or its dose/schedule will be allowed if due to relapse, intolerance, or 
medically indicated at the discretion of the T reating Physician.  However, use of rituximab , mitoxantrone , or other 
biologic agen ts such as tocilizumab  is prohibited during the trial. Patients may continue participation in this trial 
and receive the IP until the product is registered and available to treat patients diagnosed with relapsing NMO (in 
accordance with country specific regulations) or for a maximum of 5.[ADDRESS_865695] sign or symptom of a potential relapse. The Investigator or his/her designee should review, in detail, 
this information and any additional warning signs of a relapse specific to that patient’s clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_646598]. Patients should be evaluat ed within [ADDRESS_865696] be documented in the patient’s source document s and recorded on the e lectronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
 At the Relapse Evaluation Visit, a blinded Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Rater will perform the Kurtzke  
neurologic assessment to determine  the Functional System scores (FSS) and  Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) score. The Treating Physician will perform a complete neurologic examination  and document the 
Optic -Spi[INVESTIGATOR_298087] (OSIS). The Treating Physician or appropriately trained designee will perform  the 
visual acuity (VA) test (Snellen Chart) a nd Hauser Ambulatory Index (HAI) as outlined in the Relapse Evaluation 
Period section (Section  7.1.3  ). The Treating Physician will make the decision as to whether the clinical signs, 
symptoms and the neurologic change (objective findings on neurologic examination) meet the definition of an On -
Trial Relapse  (Section 7.2.1 ). If the event is confirmed as an On -Trial Relapse, the patient may be treated  according 
to the recommended Standardized On -Trial Relapse Treatment Plan.  Relapse treatment is  at the Treating 
Physician’s discretion . The tr eatment with IP will be continued per the specified dose administration schedule for 
the patient.  
 
Follow -up Relapse Evaluation V isits to monitor the course of the relapse will be performed at 1, 4 and 6 weeks 
after the onset of relapse. Additional (u nscheduled)  Follow -up Relapse Evaluation Visits outside the specified time 
points will be made  at the discretion of the Treating Physician. Patients may continue the trial participation if the 
patient and the Treating Physician decide that it is appropriate to continue to receive eculizumab treatment.  
 
Adjudication of On- Trial Relapse Events  
An independent Relapse Adjudication Committee will confirm all On -Trial Relapse events using objective and 
consistent clinical criteria described in a Relapse Endpoint  Adjudication Charter. The Adjudication Committee will 
consist of three independent medical experts in neurology/neuroophthalmology who are each experienced in the management of patients with NMO. The Adjudication Committee will decide by [CONTACT_646622] -
Trial R elapse (as determined by [CONTACT_59539])  meets the pre- defined objective criteria for an adjudicated On -Trial 
Relapse, as described in the Relapse Adjudication Charter.

Safety Follow -Up Period ( 8 weeks)  
If a patient withdraws from th is extension trial or discontinues eculizumab treatment at any time after receiving any 
amount of IP , the patient will be required to complete an Early Termination (ET) Visit at the time of the withdrawal 
and a safety Follow -up Visit , [ADDRESS_865697] dose  of IP administration. If a patient is discontinued due to an 
adverse event ( AE), the event will be followed until it is resolved or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_646599]. Patients who withdraw from th is extension trial and transition to treatment with commercially 
available eculizumab will not be required to complete a Follow -Up Visit.  
 
Post-Treatment Follow -up (a Maximum of  2 year s):  
The Sponsor may seek to collect follow -up information concerning NMO status in patie nts who have prematurely 
discontinued from the trial for up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_865698] dose of eculizumab .  
Number of patients (planned):  
This is an extension trial to the  ECU -NMO -301 trial. A maximum of 132 patients will be enrolled in the 
ECU -NMO -301 trial . Patients who complete the ECU -NMO -301 trial may potentially enter this extension trial.

Investigational product, dosag e and mode of administration:  
IP (eculizumab or placebo during the blind -induction phase), will be given by  [CONTACT_33980]  (IV) administration  over 
approximately 35 minutes.  
Blind Induction Phase : To maintain the blind of the ECU -NMO -301 trial, all patients will undergo a blind induction 
phase. IP will be administered weekly for 4 weeks during the induction phase according to the following schedule : 
 
ECU -NMO -301 
(PREVENT) Cohort  Dose  Visit #  
Eculizumab arm  4 vials IP (eculizumab 1200 mg)  1, 3 
4 vials IP (placebo)  2, 4 
Placebo arm  4 vials IP (3 vials eculizumab 900 mg + 1 vial placebo)  1, 2, 3, 4  
 
Open -label  Maintenance Phase: All patients will receive 4 vials eculizumab (1200 mg) every 2 weeks (±2 days) 
from Visit [ADDRESS_865699] throughout the trial.  
 
Supplemental Dose: If a  patient undergoes p lasmapheresis or p lasma exchange (PE) for an On- Trial Relaps e during 
the Study Period, a supplemental dose of IP  must  be administered after each PE session , preferably within 
1-2 hours . If the relapse occurs during the blinded induction phase, and the PE coincides with the day of a regularly

scheduled IP infusion:  
• For Visit 1 (Day1) and Visit 3 (Week 2), administer the scheduled 4 vials of blinded IP   
• For Visit 2 (Week 1) and Visit 4 (Week 3) administer only a supplemental IP dose, ie,  2 vials eculizumab 
(600 mg)  
If the relapse occurs during the open -label  maintenance phase, and the PE coincides with the day of a regularly 
scheduled IP infusion, admini ster the scheduled IP dose (4 vials/1200 mg eculizumab). In all other cases, 
administer only a supplemental IP dose, ie,  2 vials eculizumab (600 mg).  
 
After receiving the supplemental dose , patients are to continue IP  infusion according to the protocol -specified 
dosing regimen.  
Duration of treatment:  
The maximum total trial duration is 5.[ADDRESS_865700] patient was enrolled. Trial duration for an 
individual patient will vary depending on when the patient enters the trial; participation may continue  until the 
product is registered and available to treat patients with NMO (in accordance with country specific regulations) or 
until the trial ends , whichever occurs first.  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Not applicable.   
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Duration of treatment commences with the first IP  infusion (eculizumab).  
• On-Trial Relapses will be monitored closely throughout the trial  and evaluated as described in the above 
section “Study Period, Relapse Evaluation”. PI-determined On -Trial Relapses will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_646623] , will be  used for the ARR 
assessment.  
• Disability will be assessed by [CONTACT_646624] ( mRS ) scores comparing the change 
from baseline. The EDSS Rater , who is blinded to all other trial data, as well as all other patient clinical 
data, will be responsible for performing the Kurtzke neur ological assessments throughout the trial at the 
protocol -specified time points as well as  at the Relapse Evaluation Visit s. The Treating Physician or 
designee will perform the mRS throughout the trial at the protocol- specified time points.  
• Neurologic function will be assessed based on the EDSS FSS . Ambulatory function will be assessed by  
[CONTACT_646625]. In addition, the EDSS 
visual (optic) FSS will be used for statistical analysis of  changes in VA . Neurologic function evaluation 
will be assessed at the protocol -specified time points as well as at the On- Trial Relapse Evaluation 
Visit(s) . 
• QOL  will be assessed by [CONTACT_646626] -assessment using both the  EuroQoL  (EQ-5D) and Short Form 
Health  Survey ( SF-36) instruments at the protocol -specified time points.  
 
Safety : 
• The safety of eculizumab will be assessed based on treatment emerge nt AEs (TEAEs), SAEs , and changes 
from baseline through trial completion in vital signs  (VS) , routine clinical laboratory tests (chemistry and 
hematology), Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) , and pregnancy tests for female patients 
of childbearing potential.  
• Immunogenicity: Blood samples will be collected for evaluation for human- anti-human antibodies 
(HAHA) at specified time points to describe the presence or absence of an immune response to eculizumab and to evaluate, if antibodies are detected, whether the antibodies neutralize the activity of eculizumab.  
• The same independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that will conduct the monitoring of safety data for ECU -NMO -[ADDRESS_865701], and modifying, extending or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. A separate 
DMC Charter will document all DMC procedures and processes for the trial. Data and analysis for the DMC will be prepared by [CONTACT_146540].  
 Biomarker  
• Blood  samples and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] ( CSF) samples for NMO -IgG (AQP4 -Ab) will be measured at 
 Page [ADDRESS_865702] provided consent for lumbar puncture to obtain CSF samples.  
 
PK and PD  
• The population PK analysis of eculizumab in NMO patients will be performed to assess the concentration of eculizumab versus time. PK parameters such as maximum concentration as well as trough and peak eculizumab concentration during the induction and maintenance treatment phases will be reported. Clearance and terminal half- life will be estimated . PD analysis will be performed to assess pre- and post -
treatment serum hemolytic activity and therefore C5 complement activity inhibition. Free C5 concentration also may be measured.  
• CSF samples for PK and free C5 from patients who have opted to provide consent will be measured at 
protocol -specified time points and durin g the On -Trial Relapse Evaluation Period . 
Statistical methods:  
Analyses will be produced using the data from this trial alone as well as combined analyses that will include data from the ECU -NMO -301 trial. The analyses will include safety, efficacy, and P K/PD analyses. The statistical 
analysis plan will cover both the stand -alone trial analyses and the combined ECU -NMO -301 and ECU -NMO -302 
trial analyses.  
 SAFETY:  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Extension Safety Population and the Combined Safety Population from 
both studies. The Extension Safety Population includes all patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_865703] 1 dose of eculizumab in the ECU -
NMO- 301 t rial or this trial.  
 Note: Baseline for the e xtension trial alone analyses is defined as the last available assessment prior to starting 
treatment with eculizumab in the e xtension trial. Baseline for the combined trial safety analyses is defined as the 
last available assessment prior to starting treatment with eculizumab in ECU -NMO -[ADDRESS_865704] received placebo in the ECU -NMO- 301 trial.  
 
Safety  Analyses:  
For the e xtension trial alone, AEs onset on or after the first dose date for eculizumab in the extension trial will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_12035], system organ class (SOC), preferred term, (PT), seriousness, severity, and relationship to 
treatment.  Concomitant medications taken during the extension trial will be summarized. Changes in IST usage ( ie, 
increases, decreases, switching ISTs, etc) will be summarized.  
For the Combined Safety Population , AEs that occurred  on or after the first dose of  eculi zumab whether in the 
ECU -NMO -301 or this extension trial will be summarized by [CONTACT_12035], SOC, PT, seriousness, severity, and 
relationship to treatment. Concomitant medications taken during eculizumab treatment regardless of the trial  will be 
summarized.  
 
Changes from baseline in laboratory assessments (chemistry and hematology) will be summarized for the e xtension 
trial alone as well as for the two studies combined. Likewise, shift tables (L [low], N [normal], H [high]) will be 
produced for clinical labora tory tests for the e xtension trial alone as well as for the two studies combined. 
Pregnancy tests will be summarized in patient listings. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data will be summarized for the 
extension trial. Shift tables for the C -SSRS will be produced for the e xtension trial. 
 
Immunogenicity as measured by [CONTACT_646627] a patient listing for the 
extension trial alone as well a s for the two studies combined.  
 
EFFICACY:  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Extension Trial Full Analysis Set (Extension FAS) population as well as 
the Extension Trial Per -Protocol (Extension PP) population. In addition, efficacy analyses will be performed on the 
Combined  Full Analysis Set ( Combined  FAS) population as well as the Combined  Per-Protocol ( Combined PP) 
population from the combined ECU -NMO -301 trial and the extension trial.  
 
Extension FAS Population : The population on which primary, secondary, and tertiary efficacy analyses will be 
performed consists of all patients who  have received at least [ADDRESS_865705]-IP infusion efficacy assessment.  
 
Extension PP Population : A subset of the Extension FAS  population, excluding patients with major extension trial 
protocol deviations. The  Extension PP population will include all patients who:  
• Have no major protocol deviations or key inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that might potentially 
affect efficacy  
• Patients who took at least 80% of the required eculizumab doses during participa tion in the extension 
trial  
Combined  FAS Population : The population on which primary, secondary, and tertiary efficacy analyses will be 
performed consists of all patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_865706] -IP infusion efficacy assessment. 
 Combined  PP Population: A subset of the Combined F AS population, excluding patients with major protocol 
deviations from either the ECU -NMO -301 or extension trial. The Combined PP  population will include all patients 
who:  
• Have no major protocol deviations or key inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that might potentially 
affect efficacy  
• Patients who took at least 80% of the required eculizumab doses during participation in ECU -NMO -
301 and/or this trial  
The Extension PP population as well as the Combined PP population will be determined prio r to database lock. 
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is ARR  including all relapses as identified by [CONTACT_737] . Baseline ARR for all 
patients will be calculated starting [ADDRESS_865707] met its primary efficacy endpoint if a statistically significant p-v alue (< 0.05) is observed for 
the change in ARR between the baseline ARR  and the On -Trial ARR when on eculizumab treatment in ECU -
NMO- [ADDRESS_865708]. Confidence intervals (95%) for the change and percentage change in 
the ARR will be presented. The percentage of patients who are relapse- free based on On- Trial Relapse events while 
on eculizumab treatment in ECU -NMO -302 along with 95% confidence intervals will be computed using the 
Kaplan -Meier method.  A sensitivity analysis will be performed for the change in ARR between the baseline ARR 
and the adjudicated On -Trial ARR when on eculizumab treatment in ECU -NMO -[ADDRESS_865709]. The percentage of patients who are relapse- free while on  eculizumab treatment in ECU -NMO -302 along with 
95% confidence intervals will also be computed using the Kaplan -Meier method for the adjudicated On -Trial 
relapses. 
 
Additional analyses will be performed on the combined data from ECU -NMO- 301and ECU -NMO -302 trials.  
Baseline ARR for all patients will be calculated starting 1 year prior to enrollment in the ECU -NMO -301 trial and 
will include all On -Trial attacks (as identified by [CONTACT_737]) that occur in the ECU -NMO- [ADDRESS_865710]  will be used to assess the change in ARR between 
the baseline ARR and the On-Trial ARR when on eculizumab treatment. Confidence intervals (95%) for the change 
and percentage change in the ARR will be presented. The percentage of patients who are relapse- free based on On -
Trial Relapse events while on eculizumab treatment along with 95% confidence intervals will be computed using 
the Kaplan -Meier method.  A sensitivity analysis will be performed for the change in ARR between the baseline 
ARR and the adjudicated On -Trial ARR when o n eculizumab treatment using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. The 
percentage of patients who are relapse- free while on eculizumab treatment along with 95% confidence intervals 
will also be computed using the Kaplan -Meier method for the adjudicated On -Trial rel apses.

Secondary Efficacy Analysis for the Trial Period:  
Baseline for the extension trial alone is defined as the last available assessment prior to starting treatment with 
eculizumab in the extension trial.  Baseline for the combined trial efficacy analyses is defined as the last available 
assessment prior to starting treatment with eculizumab in ECU -NMO -301 or this trial for all patients.  
Changes from baseline for the various secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized over the applicable visits.  
1. Change from baseline in EDSS score  
2. Change from baseline in EQ -5D  
3. Change from baseline in mRS score  
4. Change from baseline in HAI  in patients with abnormal baseline ambulatory function  
5. Change from baseline in VA  in patient s with abnormal baseline visual function   
The primary analysis for the change from baseline in EDSS score at a particular visit will be based on the repeated 
measures model with effects for baseline EDSS and visit. Changes from baseline in the HAI , VA, EQ-5D index 
score, EQ -5D visual analog scale , and mRS  will be analyzed in a similar manner as changes in EDSS score using 
the baseline and visit as covariates in the modeling. In addition, summary statistics for the changes from baseline in the mRS score will be produced by [CONTACT_765]. Likewise, shift tables from baseline in the mRS  score will be produced by 
[CONTACT_765]. By-patient listings of the secondary endpoints assessments and changes from baseline in the secondary 
endpoints will be produced.  
 For the secondary endp oints, some summaries by [CONTACT_646628]. Patients will belong to one of four 
possible subgroups:  
(a) patients randomized to eculizumab who did not have rel apses in the ECU -NMO- 301 trial,
 
(b) patients randomized to eculizumab who did have relaps es in the ECU -NMO -301 trial,  
(c) patients randomized to placebo who did not have relapse s in the ECU -NMO -301 trial, and  
(d) patients  randomized to placebo who did have rel apses in the ECU -NMO- 301 trial.  
 
For the patients in sub -group (a), baseline is defined as the baseline assessment (last available assessment) prior to 
dosing in the ECU -NMO -301 trial. For the patients in sub -group (c) , baseline is defined as the last available 
assessment prior to dosing with eculizumab in this trial. For the patients in subgroups (b) and (d), baseline for these 
subgroup analyses is defined as the last available assessment prior to eculizumab dosing in this extension trial  in 
consideration of neur ologic changes and recoveries as a result of relapse in  the E CU-NMO -301 trial . Changes from 
baseline for the various secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized separately for the 4 subgroups of patients over the applicable visits. Missing secondary endpoint assessments will not be imputed.   
Tertiary Efficacy A nalysis for the Trial Period:  
Like the secondary efficacy endpoint, the tertiary endpoint analyses will be based on changes from baseline.  
1. Change from baseline in HAI score   
2. Change from baseline in VA   
3. Change from baseline in the SF -36  
4. Change from baseline in the EDSS FSS  
Changes from baseline in the HAI score and VA  will be analyzed in a similar manner to the secondary endpoint 
analyses described for HAI with abnormal baseline ambulatory function and VA with abnormal baseline visual 
function using repeated measures models . 
 Change from baseline in QOL  will be s ummarized as appropriate to the QOL instrument and analyses will be 
performed as specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
 Changes from b aseline in the EDSS FSS will be analyzed in a similar manner to the secondary endpoint analyses 
described for the EDSS score using repeated measures models . 
 In addition, summaries of changes from baseline like those for the secondary efficacy endpoints will also be created for the tertiary efficacy endpoints for the 4 subgroups of patients from the ECU -NMO -301 trial who are treated in 
the extension trial.

Other Efficacy Analyses: On -Trial Relapses:  
For patients with a PI-determined On-Trial relapse(s), summary tables of the types of relapses and the severity of 
the relapses will be produced. Summary tables will also be produced only for those patients with adjudicated On-
Trial relapse(s). A by -patient listing of the PI -determined  On-Trial relapses , including the subsequent  adjudication 
outcome  will be produced. The severity of a relapse will be determined using the OSIS scale. Severity will be 
assessed at the time of the relapse.   
 
Changes from baseline to all of the trial -collected time -points after a relapse (and before the next relapse if the 
patient happens to have more than one relapse) will be summarized for EDSS, HAI, and VA . Changes from the last 
assessment prior to the relapse to all trial collected time -points after a relapse (and before the next relapse if the 
patient happens to have more than one relapse) will be summarized for EDSS, HAI, and VA . Likewise, changes 
from the assessment 1 week after the relapse to all trial collected time -points after that time point (and before the 
next relapse if the patient happens to have more than one relapse) will be summarized for EDSS, HAI, and VA . 
These summaries will be produced for patients with a PI -determined On -Trial relapse(s) as well as for only those 
patients with adjudicated On -Trial relapse(s).  Pa tient listings for the EDSS, HAI, and VA  assessments before and 
after a relapse will be created for the patients with all On -Trial relapses  as determined by [CONTACT_978](s) , including the 
subsequent  adjudication outcome . 
 
Biomarker Analysis for the Trial Period:  
Changes from baseline for NMO -IgG assessments will be summarized and patient listings for the NMO biomarker 
data will be created.  
 
PK/PD for the Trial Period:  
Population PK analysis of eculizumab in NMO patients will be performed to assess the concentrati on of 
eculizumab versus time. PK parameters such as maximum concentration as well as trough and peak eculizumab concentration during the induction and maintenance treatment phases will be reported. Clearance and terminal half -
life will be estimated. PD ana lysis will be performed to assess pre - and post -treatment serum hemolytic activity and 
therefore C5 complement activity inhibition. Free C5 concentration also may be measured.

5. INTRODUCTION 
Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)  or NMO Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) , also known as Devic’s 
Disease, is a rare, severe disabling autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous 
system (CNS) that predominately affects the optic nerves and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and is often 
characterized by a relapsing course (1;2). Currently there are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646603]. Complement activation is a key element in the development of CNS lesions 
in NMO. Eculizumab (h5G1.1- mAb) is a terminal complement inh ibitor that blocks conversion 
of C5 to C5a and C5b thus blocking terminal complement activation. The mechanism of action 
of eculizumab as a terminal complement inhibitor suggests that it may provide therapeutic 
benefit in the management of NMO by [CONTACT_646629] (see 
the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more information).  
A phase [ADDRESS_865724] clinical data that will provide 
long term safety and efficacy information on eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO.  
Throughout this document, the term NMO refers to both NMO and NMOSD.  
Refer to  Protocol ECU- NMO -301 and to the current IB for additional information on the safety 
and efficacy data of eculizumab .

6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
6.1. Primary Objective  
• Evaluate the long -term safety of eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO.  
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate the long -term efficacy of eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO as 
measured by [CONTACT_646621] (ARR)  
• Evaluate long -term efficacy of eculizumab by [CONTACT_389342]:  
o Disability  
o Quality of life (QOL)  
o Neurologic functions 
• Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of eculizumab in 
relapsing NMO patients.  
 Page [ADDRESS_865725] completed the trial ECU -NMO-301 may  be 
eligible to participate in this extension trial. Prior to initiating any extension trial procedures , an 
Informed Consent F orm (ICF) must be signed and inclusion/exclusion criteria must be obtained, 
evaluated and met. Patients who exit the ECU -NMO-[ADDRESS_865726] extension trial visit once the Week 6 Follow-up Relapse Evaluation Visit is completed and 
no later than 2 weeks (14 days ±2 days) after the last IP dose; patients who exit the ECU- NMO-
[ADDRESS_865727] extension trial visit once the End of Study 
(EOS ) Visit is completed and no later  than  2 weeks (14 days ±2 days) after the last IP 
administration in the ECU -NMO-301 trial.  
Due to the length of this extension trial, patients may need to be revaccinated for N meningitidis  
to provide active coverage as specified by [CONTACT_389359]/countr y guidelines.  
Patients who have been unblinded in ECU- NMO-301 may not continue in ECU- NMO-302. 
7.1.1. Blind Induction Phase (Visits 1 – 4) 
To preserve the blinded nature of the ECU- NMO-[ADDRESS_865728] (IP) weekly (±2 days)  for 4 doses. Patients who had been 
randomized to the placebo arm in the ECU- NMO- 301 trial will start with the induction dos e (ie,  
they will receive blinded IP [3 vials/900 mg eculizumab plus 1 vial placebo] at Visits 1 to 4 ). 
Patients who were randomized to the eculizumab arm in the ECU- NMO- 301 trial will continue 
with the maintenance dose (ie,  they will receive blinded IP [4 vials /1200 mg eculizumab every 
two weeks (±2 days) at Visits 1 and 3 and 4 vials of placebo at Visits 2 and 4]) . All patients will 
receive open- label  4 vials/[ADDRESS_865729]. 
7.1.2. Open -Label Maintenance Phase  
All patients will receive open-label eculizumab (4 vials/1200 mg) every 2 weeks (±2 days) 
during the maintenance phase. The end of the trial occurs a maximum of 5.[ADDRESS_865730] be present at the trial site , as applicable,  for visit -specific 
procedures/assessments including IP administration (see Schedule of Assessments in Section  7.5). For other visits, patients may have an opportunity to receive IP administration 
remotely at a medical facility that is located near the patient’s home or at the patient’s home with 
the permission of the Investigator in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or 
regulations of the pertinent regulatory authorities. These visits will be conducted by a qualified staff member from the medical facility near the patient’ s home or by [CONTACT_233553]- care health 
professionals, who are under the direct supervision of the Investigator. The trial medication will be prepared  and administered at the patient’s home or at the medical facility. During a remote

dosing visit, information on adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and signs or 
symptoms of NMO relapses  will be collected and sent to the Investigator’s site for evaluation  on 
the day of the visit. Patients must go to  the trial site for evaluation if the patient reports any sig ns 
or symptoms that suggest a serious adverse event (SAE) or NMO relapse.  
Supportive immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for relapse prevention is allowed during the 
extension trial at the T reating Physician’s discretion. However, use of rituximab, mitoxantrone, 
or other biologic agent s such as tocilizumab  is prohibited during the trial. 
Patients may continue participation in this trial and receive the IP until the product is registered 
and available to treat patients diagnosed with relapsing NMO (in  accordance with country 
specific regulations) or for a maximum of 5.[ADDRESS_865731] sign or symptom of a potential 
relapse. The Investigator or his/her designee should review, in detail, this information and any additional warning signs of a relapse specific to that patient’s clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_646598]. Patients should be evaluated within [ADDRESS_865732] be documented in the patient’s source documents and recorded on the electronic case report forms ( eCRF s).  
At the Relapse Evaluation Visit, a blinded Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Rater will perform the Kurtzke neurologic assessment  and document the Functional System scores (FSS) to 
determine the EDSS score. The Treating Physician will perform a complete neurologic 
examination  and document the Optic- Spi[INVESTIGATOR_298087] (OSIS) . Treating Physician or 
appropriately trained designee will perform the visual acuity (VA) test (Snellen Chart) and 
Hauser Ambulatory Index (HAI) as outlined in the Relapse Evaluation Period  (section 7.6.2).  
The Treating Physician will make the decision as to whether the clinical signs, symptoms and neurologic change (objective findings on neurologic examination) meet the definition of an On-Trial Relapse (Section 7.2.1). The blinded EDSS Rater will complete the Kurtzke neurologic 
assessment and document the FSS and  EDSS scores. If the event is confirmed as an On -Trial 
Relapse, the patient may be treated  according to  the recommended Standardized On -Trial 
Relapse Treatment Plan  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Relapse treatment is at the Treating Physician’s 
discretion . The IP administration will be continued as scheduled every 1  week (if during the 
induction phase) or every 2 weeks (if during th e maintenance phase) until the EOS .  
Follow-up Relapse Evaluation visits to monitor the course of the relapse will be performed at 1, 4 and 6 weeks after the onset of relapse. Additional (unscheduled) Follow-up Relapse Evaluation 
Visits outside the specified time points will be made at the discretion of the Treating Physician. Following a relapse, a p atient may continue  in the trial if the patient and the Treating Physician 
decide that it is appropriate to continue to receive eculizumab treatment.  
All reports of possible relapses and actions taken for the possible relapse must be documented in the patient’s source documents and recorded in the e CRF.  
 Page [ADDRESS_865733] of three independent medical 
experts in neurology/neuroophthalmology who are each experienced in the management of patients with NMO. The Adjudication Committee will decide by [CONTACT_646630] -defined objective criteria for an adjudicated On -Trial Relapse, as described 
in the Relapse Adjudic ation Charter.  
7.1.4. Safety Follow- up Period ( Post-Treatment ) 
If a patient withdraws from this  extension trial at any time after receiving any amount of IP, the 
patient will be required to complete an Early Termination  (ET)  Visit at the time of the 
withdrawal an d a safety Follow-up Visit, [ADDRESS_865734] IP administration. If a patient is 
discontinued due to an AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1237]  (PI), is determined medically stable.  Patients  who withdraw from the 
extension trial and transition to treatment with the commercially available eculizumab will not be 
required to complete a safety Follow- up Visit.  
7.1.5. Post-Treatment Follow -up (a Maximum of 2 Year s) 
The Sponsor may seek to collect follow-up information concerning NMO status in patients who have prematurely discontinued from the trial for a maximum of [ADDRESS_865735] dose of eculizumab (refer to  Appendix 11) . 
7.2. Standard Protocol Definitions 
7.2.1. On-Trial Relapse  
On-Trial Relapses are acute attacks that occur during the trial. For this protocol, On-T rial 
Relapse is defined as a new onset of neurologic symptoms or worsening of existing neurologic 
symptoms with an objective change (clinical sign) on neurologic examination that persists for 
more than [ADDRESS_865736] be 
attributed to NMO, ie,  not caused by [CONTACT_646631], excessive exercise, 
or excessively high ambient temperature. Isolated changes on magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI ) or other imaging investigation with no related clinical findings is  not considered an On-
Trial Relapse. The relapse must be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] 30 days of clinical stability. The Treating 
Physician is not required to wait 24 hours prior to initiating treatment for the relapse .  
All PI -determined relapses will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_350952]; to  determine if they 
meet protocol- defined criteria for an On -Trial relapse event . 
7.2.2. Severity of Relapse  
Severity of an On -trial Relapse will be measured by [CONTACT_298173]. The OSIS Visual Acuity (VA) 
Subscale Scores will be used to cat egorize the severity of optic neuritis relapse. The OSIS Motor 
Subscale Scores and Sensory Subscale Scores will used to categorize the severity of transverse myelitis. OSIS scores  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_646632] 3 below.

7.2.3. The Treating Physician  
The Treating Physician  is the PI [INVESTIGATOR_386063] -Investigator for the trial, and will be responsible for 
overall patient management including patient eligibility evaluation, the supervision of the 
blinded (induction phase) and open label (maintenance phase) IP admi nistration, the recording 
and treating of AEs and the monitoring of safety assessment. In addition, the Treating Physician or an appropriately trained designee will perform mRS and C- SSRS assessments. At the time of 
a relapse the Treating Physician will pe rform a complete neurologic exam  and determine if a 
patient experiences an On -Trial Relapse, determine relapse severity by [CONTACT_298173], assess VA test 
(Snell en Chart), ambulation (HAI), have the patient complete EQ- 5D and SF -36, and may treat 
the patient’s relapse at his/her discretion, according to the recommended Standardized On- Trial 
Relapse Treatment plan  (section [IP_ADDRESS]). Treatment for On -Trial Re lapse and any changes in the 
ISTs are  at the discretion of the Treating Physician.  
7.2.4. The (Blinded) EDSS Rater  
The blinded EDSS Rater will be responsible for performing the EDSS assessments throughout 
the trial at protocol- specified time points including at the time of a relapse. The EDSS Rater will 
perform the Kurtzke neurologic assessment (5) and document the FSS and EDSS score. The 
EDSS Rater shall not be the PI [INVESTIGATOR_646604] , and cannot be directly involved in the 
trial patient’s management. The EDSS Rater must remain blinded to all other trial data as well as 
 Page 27 of 104

1. Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at a central laboratory. Reference Appendix [ADDRESS_865751]  (urine or 
serum)  may also be performed at any time during the trial at the Investigator’s discretion.  
3. Patients may choose not to have CSF samples collected and will still be eligible for trial participation.  CSF sampling will be collected at Day 1/Visit [ADDRESS_865752] provided consent and did not already  provide a sample at the EOS  Visit in Study ECU -NMO -301. 
4. Trough samples for PK/PD and free C5 level testing are to be taken approximately 5-[ADDRESS_865753] 60 
minutes after completion of the IP infusion.  
5. The blinded EDSS Rater will perform the Kurtzke neurologic assessment and document the FSS and EDSS score.  See Section 7.2.4  for more detail  
6. The Treating Physician will be responsible for assessment of the patient for any  signs or symptoms indicative o f relapse at every visit and perform a complete 
neurologic examination at the specified time points. The Treating Physician will document the Optic -Spi[INVESTIGATOR_298087] (OSIS).  
7. The Treating Physician or appropriately trained designee will perform t he VA test using Snellen chart , the Hauser Ambulatory Index  (HAI)  and the C -SSRS  (Since 
Last Visit) .  
8. Additional tests/procedures may be performed as medically indicated at the Investigator’s discretion. If additional medically indicated tests/procedures are performed 
these procedures / tests must be recorded in source documents and on the electronic case report form  (eCRF) .  
9. Patients may be revaccinated for N meningitidis  to provide active coverage as specified by [CONTACT_389359]/country 
guidelines. Patients will be given a Patient Safety Identification Card prior to the first dose of trial medication. At each visit throug hout the t rial, trial staff will ensure 
that the patient has the Patient Safety Identification Card.  
10. Patients will undergo a blind induction phase at Visits 1 – 4. All patients will receive open -label  IP at Visits [ADDRESS_865754] and throughout the trial. If a pat ient 
undergoes plasma exchange ( PE) for On -Trial Relapse, a supplemental dose of  IP must be administered after each PE session , preferably within 1 -2 hours , according 
to the regimen described under Supplemental Dose in Section  9.1.  
11. Relapse Evaluation Visit: every effort should be made to evaluate potential relapses within [ADDRESS_865755] be evaluated by [CONTACT_646635] . 
12. Additional unscheduled Follow -up Relapse Evaluation Visits are permitted at the discretion of the Investigato r. 
13. If a patient is unable to attend the safety follow -up visit as deemed medically necessary by [CONTACT_737], the Investigator may perform the follow -up visit by 
[CONTACT_756]. All visit assessments should be performed with exception of vital signs.  
∆ In Clinic visits must be conducted at the study sites; Remote visits may be conducted remotely at a medical facility that is located near the patient’s home or at the 
patient’s home with the permission of the Investigator in accordance with all national,  state, and local laws or regulations of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
† For patients who reach visit 29 (end of first year), the visit schedule and assessment scheme for the second year and beyond  will restart from Visit [ADDRESS_865756] (Table 7 )

7.6. Trial Visit Procedures 
7.6.1. Trial Period  
Visit intervals during induction phase (Visits 1 to 5) are weekly (every 7 ±2 days). Visit intervals 
during the open -label  maintenance phase (Visits 6 – 107) are every 2 weeks (every 14 days 
±2 days). Patients who fail to return for a scheduled visit/dosing appointment must be contact[CONTACT_55654] ’s study staff to determine the reason for missing the appointment. Patients will be 
strongly encouraged to return to the study site for evaluation if a relapse or AE is suspected to 
have occurred. In the exceptional circumstance where a patient cannot or does not come to the study site for examination, then the patient will be instructed to see his or her local neurologist or physician. In this event, the study site will obtain relevant medical records as documentation 
from the local physician’s examination and enter relevant data in the Relapse Evaluation Visit 
form or AE  form , as appropriate.  
As it is vital to obtain information  on any patient’s missing visit to ensure the missed 
appointment was not due to an AE or potential relapse, every effort must be made to undertake protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures. Follow-up due diligence documentation will 
consist of 3 phone calls followed by 1 registered letter to the patient’s last known address.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Palliative and Supportive Care 
Palliative and supportive care is permitted during the course of the trial for underlying 
conditions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunosuppressive Agents  
• Immunosuppressive agents, eg,  corticosteroid, azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) , methotrexate,  tacrolimus,  or cyclophosphamide either in combination 
or mono- therapy are allowed at the discretion  of the Investigator.  
• Change in IST or its dose/schedule will be allowed if due to relapse, intolerance, or 
medically indicated at the discretion of the T reating P hysician.  Any changes in 
immunosuppressive therapy will be recorded in the e CRF page for concomitant 
medication . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recommended Standardized Relapse Treatment  
For this protocol, the treatment of relapse is at the discretion of the Treating Physician. The 
following standardized treatment regimen for a confirmed On -Trial Relapse is recommended , in 
accordance with expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] (1): 
• One gram intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) administered daily for 3-5 days 
followed by [CONTACT_646646]. If the patient improves, then continue the 
trial assessments as per schedule of this protocol. 
• If there is no or minimal response to IVMP , PE will be allowed at the discretion of 
the treating neurologist. Five cycles of PE , each remov ing 1.0-1.5 volumes of 
circulating plasma , are recommended for treatment of attacks that do not respond to 
IVMP.  
If a patient undergoes PE for an On-Trial Relapse during the Treatment Period, a supplemental 
dose of IP should be administered after each PE, preferably within 1-2 hours , as described under 
Supplemental Dose in S ection  9.1 above. After receiving the su pplemental dose , patients are to 
continue protocol-specified dosing until the W eek 6 Follow-up Visit.

Patients will be infused with IP under the supervision of the Treating Physician  or designee to 
ensure that the patient receives the appropriate dose at the appropriate time -points during the 
trial. 
Patients who fail to return for a scheduled visit must be contact[CONTACT_55654] ’s study staff to 
determine the reason for missing the appointment. Patients will be strongly encouraged to return 
to the study site for evaluation if a relapse or AE  is suspected to have occurred. In the 
except ional circumstance where a patient cannot or does not come to the study site for 
examination, then the patient will be instructed to see his or her local neurologist or physician. In this event, the study site will obtain relevant medical records as documentation from the local 
physician’s examination, and enter relevant data in the Relapse Evaluation Visit form or AE  
form as appropriate. As it is vital to obtain any patient’s missing visit to assure the missed 
appointment was not due to an AE or potential relapse, every effort must be made to undertake 
protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures. Follow-up due diligence documentation will 
consist of 3 phone calls followed by 1 registered letter to the patient’s last known address.

10.2. Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling  
The active IP, eculizumab , is manufactured and supplied by [CONTACT_288967], Inc., or 
selected contract manufacturing organization  in single 30 mL vials as a solution concentration of 
10 mg/mL. The comparator  product is manufactured by [CONTACT_646647],  Inc., or 
selected contract manufacturing organization  as a matching sterile, clear, colorless solution with 
the same buffer components but without active ingredient, in an identical [ADDRESS_865779] Storage  
IP will be released to the site upon receipt of all required essential documents based upon 
federal, state, and local regulations.  
Upon arrival at the center, the IP should be promptly removed from the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_389327] 2°C to 8°C with minimal light exposure . The pharmacist 
should immediately record the receipt  of the IP in the IXRS and notify the distributor and the 
Sponsor if vials are damaged  and/or if temperature excursions have occurred during 
transportation. IP must be stored in a secure, limited -access storage area, and temperature should 
be monitored daily. Diluted solutions of IP are stable for 24 hours at 2 to 8°C (36-46°F) and at room temperature.

refrigeration, warming and infusion. 
10.5. Investigational Product Administration  
DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS INJECTION.  
IP should only be administered via IV infusion  via gravity feed, a syringe -type pump, or an 
infusion pump, and must be diluted to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL prior to administration. 
Prior to administration,  if the diluted solution is refrigerated, it should be allowed to warm to 
room temperature by [CONTACT_57741]. The diluted solution must not be heated in a 
microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products 
should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
The diluted IP should be intravenously administered over approximately 35 minutes.Diluted IP is 
stable for 24 hours at 2-8°C (36-46°F) and at room temperature. It is not necessary to protect the 
infusion bags from light while IP is being administered to the patient. The patients will be 
monitored for at least [ADDRESS_865781] 
be captured in the patient’s source document and e CRF.  
10.6. Investigational Product Accountability  
When an IP shipment is received at the site, the pharmacist should verify the contents, sign the 
packing  invoice provided with the shipment, and maintain the original copy for review by [CONTACT_646649]. A signed copy should be faxed to the contact [CONTACT_389373].  
Additionally, reception of IP (as well as reception conditions) must be reported to the IXRS to 
allow IP resupply, estimations and expi[INVESTIGATOR_57708]. 
Accountability logs and Inventory logs will be provided to assist the pharmacist in maintaining 
current and accurate inventory records covering receipt, dispensing, and disposition of the IP. 
During the trial, the following information must be noted in the accountability log: the patient number(s), initials of patient(s) to whom IP is dispensed, kit number, the date(s) and time that the 
IP is prepared, and the initials of the pharmacist or designee who prepared the IP. Sites should 
keep a running total of their IP supply. Empty vials and vials with residual materials should be 
kept for inspection and accountability by [CONTACT_646650]. Destruction of used and unused 
vials, either locally or centrally, must be properly documented. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for detailed instructions on general receipt, storage, preparation, administration, destruction and return of IP. 
Each kit label will have a place for the pharmacist to record the patient number and initials.  
The CRA  will examine the inventory during the trial. Additionally, the inventory records must be 
readily available and may be subject to regulatory authorities, the local regulatory agency, or an 
independent auditor’s inspection at any time. 
10.7. Investigational Produ ct Handling and Disposal  
At the completion of the trial, in order to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug 
accountability, all remaining IP inventory will be reconciled and retained or destroyed  according 
to applicable provincial and federal regulations.

11.1.1. Relapses  
On-Trial Relapses will be monitored throughout the trial. Patients will be educated on the 
potential signs and symptoms of NMO relapse. The Investigator or his/her designee will review, 
in detail, the signs and symptoms of a potential relapse with the patient at each visit. The p atients 
will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_646643] a potential relapse. 
Patients should be evaluated within [ADDRESS_865783] be evaluate d by [CONTACT_646651] . The 
Treating Physician will make the decision as to whether the clinical signs, symptoms, and 
neurologic change (objective findings on neurological exam ination) meet the definition for On -
Trial Relapse and may treat the patient’s relapse according to the recommended  Standardized 
On-Trial Relapse Treatment Plan  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The relapse treatment  is at the Treating

Physician’s discretion . All investigations/tests related to the relapse evaluation ( eg, MRIs, CTs, 
lumbar punctures, etc) should be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF; copi[INVESTIGATOR_646609]. 
Follow-up Relapse Evaluation V isits, to monitor the course of the relapse until stabilization , will 
be performed at 1, 4, and 6 weeks after the onset of the relapse. Additional (unscheduled) 
Follow-up Relapse Evaluation Visits will be made at the Treating Physician ’s discretion. All 
reports of possible relapses and actions taken must be documented in the patient’s source 
documents and recorded in the e CRF ; copi[INVESTIGATOR_646610]. 
Relapses that do not meet the criteria for SAE (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) should be reported as part of the relapse evaluation visits, and not as AEs. 
All PI -determined relapses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_646652]; if confirmed by [CONTACT_136636], these events qualify as adjudicated On -Trial Relapses . Adjudicated events will be 
used in the ARR assessment.  
11.1.2. Disability  
Disability will be assessed by  [CONTACT_646653]. 
The EDSS Rater,  who is blinded to all other trial data as well as all other patient clinical data , 
will be responsible for performing the EDSS assessments throughout the trial at the protocol-
specified time points as well as at visits during the Relapse Evaluation Period . The Treating 
Physician or designee will perform the mRS throughout the trial at the protocol- specified time 
points. 
11.1.3. Neurologic Functions  
Neurologic function will be assessed based on the EDSS FSS. Ambulatory function will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_646654]. 
In addition, the EDSS visual (optic) FSS  will be used for statistical analysis of changes in VA .  
The Snellen chart should be positioned at 6 meters (20 feet) distance, in a well -illuminated area, 
and the best available visual correction should be used ( eg, the patient should use their latest 
eyeglasses or eye lenses). The patient can miss one letter per row to score that row. If the patient 
is unable to read the chart, then test the patients’ ability to count fingers (at approximately 1 
meter distance), distinguish hand motion or perceive light (by [CONTACT_646655]). 
Neurologic function evaluation will be assessed at the protocol- specified time po ints as well as at 
visits during the Relapse Evaluation Period . 
11.1.4. Quality of Life  
QOL will be assessed by [CONTACT_646626] -assessment using both the EQ -5D and SF-36 
instruments at the protocol- specified time points.

12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
12.1. Safety Parameters  
The safety of eculizumab will be assessed based on treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), SAEs, 
and changes from baseline through trial completion in VS , routine clinical laboratory tests 
(chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), C- SSRS, and pregnancy tests for fe male patients of 
childbearing potential.  
Blood samples will be collected for evaluation for HAHA at specified time points to describe the 
presence or absence of an immune response to eculizumab and to evaluate, if antibodies are 
detected, whether the antibodies neutralize the activity of eculizumab.  
The same independent DMC that will conduct the monitoring of safety data for the ECU -NMO-
[ADDRESS_865784], and modifying, extending or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. A separate DMC Charter will document all DMC procedures and processes for the trial. Data 
and analysis for the DMC will be prepared by [CONTACT_146540]. 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
At Visit 1, patients’ initials, date of birth, race or ethnic origin and sex will be collected. Medical 
history, including relevant medical/surgica l history and NMO history, will be reviewed and 
recorded in the ECU- NMO-302 trial. 
12.1.2. Vital Signs  
VS will be measured at every visit and will include assessments of systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (BP), temperature, RR and heart rate (HR). VS  will be ob tained after the patient has 
been supi[INVESTIGATOR_178659] 5 minutes. Ideally, each patient’s BP should be measured using the same arm. Systolic and diastolic BPs will be documented in mmHg. Temperature will be obtained in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. HR will be documented in beats per minute. 
12.1.3. Weight 
Body weight will be measured in pounds or kilograms. Body weight will be measured at visits 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 7.5.  
12.1.4. Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed at visits specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Section 7.5. The complete physical examination will include assessments of the 
following organ/body systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, pulse, chest, heart, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal, and general neurologic examination. For 
consistency, all efforts should be made to have the physical examination performed by [CONTACT_646656].

12.1.5. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted at visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments  in 
Section  7.5. Additional ECG assessments are permitted at the Investigator’s discretion. The 
Investigator or designee will be responsible for reviewing the ECG to assess whether the ECG is 
within normal limits and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be indicated on the e CRF. For any clinically significant abnormal ECG results, the 
Investigator must contact [CONTACT_646657]’s continued eligibility to participate in this protocol. 
12.1.6. Laboratory Assessments 
Patients will have biologic samples collected fo r analysis of various parameters. The central 
laboratory will supply established or generally acknowledged methods, normal reference ranges, 
and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931]. 
Chemistry panel, complete blood count and urinalysis, hemolytic markers, renal function 
measures, and serum pregnancy test (See Appendix 8 for details) will be prepared and shipped 
according to the instructions in the laboratory manual to the central laboratory. Samples will be analyzed at the central laboratory.  Leukopenia has been reported in about 10% of patients with 
aHUS treated with eculizumab. In the NMO patient population, who may also be treated with immunosuppressive agents that are known to affect WBC counts, close monitoring of cell counts is imperative. Routine hematology laboratory assessment including CBC will be performed at 
various time points as specified by [CONTACT_646658]. Additional assessments to monitor WBC counts can be performed at the discretion of the T reating  Physician as medically indicated. Treatment of leukopenia is at the discretion of 
the T reating Physician and consultation with hematologist is encouraged as medically indicated. 
Blood samples for PK, PD, free C5 and HAHA and CSF samples for PK and free C5  analysis 
will be prepared and shipped according to the instructions in the laboratory manual to the central 
laboratory. Sample analysis will be conducted at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or a contracted 
organization. Patients may choose not to have CSF sa mples collected and will still be eligible for 
trial participation.  
Samples for NMO- IgG will be prepared and shipped according to the instructions in the central 
laboratory manual. Sample analysis will be conducted at a central laboratory.  
AEs and events related to the patients’ underlying disease that have occurred during the trial will 
be collected at every visit (see Section 12.2 Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Section). 
Any clinically significant, abnormal laboratory result is to be reported as an AE. 
12.1.7. Columbia -Suicidal Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS- Since Last Visit will be performed by [CONTACT_646659]  7.5. Additional C-
SSRS assessments are permitted as needed. Thi s is to ensure that patients who are experiencing 
suicidal thoughts or behavior are properly recognized and adequately managed or referred for 
further evaluation .

12.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of causal relationship will be reported as described 
in the sections below. 
For all AEs the Investigator must obtain adequate information for the following: 1) determine the 
outcome of the AE; 2) determine if the event meets criteria for an SAE; 3) assess the severity of 
the AE, and 4) determine the causality of the AE. For AEs with a causal relationship to the IP, 
the Investigator must follow -up on the outcome of the event until the event or sequelae either 
resolve or stabilize.  
As this is an extension to the ECU -NMO-301 trial, patients may  sign the informed consent for 
the extension trial while still enrolled in the ECU -NMO-301 tr ial. AE s with an onset date before 
Study Day 1 of the extension trial ( ECU -NMO-302) will be recorded in eCRF of ECU -NMO -
301 regardless of when the patient signed the ICF for the extension trial. Any ongoing AEs at the 
time of Study Day 1 of the extension trial  will be transferred to the extensions trial e CRF. AE s 
with an end date before Study Day 1 of ECU- NMO-301 will be recorded only on the ECU -
NMO-301 e CRF . 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (ICH Harmonised Tripartite 
Guideline Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedite Reporting 
E2A. Step 4 version, dated 27 October, 1994). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even 
if no study treatment has been administered. AEs can be classified into non-serious AEs or 
SAEs.  
For this trial, information about relapses that do not meet the SAE criteria below (Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] ) should be recorded in source documents and in the eCRF as part of the r elapse 
evaluation visits and not reported as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Test Finding  
Abnormal test findings may be considered AEs o r SAEs  at the Investigator’s discretion; 
however, Investigators are strongly encouraged to report the diagnosis, sign or symptom instead 
of just the abnormal result. The criteria for an abnormal test finding being classified as an AE or SAE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with a sign or symptom; 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing;  
• Test result requires a medical or surgical intervention;  
• Test result leads to a change in trial dosing outside of the protocol defined dosing or 
disconti nuation from the trial;  
Page 60 of 104 
Alexion Confidential  
Protocol ECU -NMO -302, Amendment 6  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
22 March 2018  
• Test result requires s ignificant additional treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that fulfills one or more of the criteria listed below must be recorded as a SAE. A SAE 
(experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetical ly might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical event  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79467]. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bron chospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lack of Efficacy  
Since eculizumab treatment in relapsing NMO patients is not an approved indication, lack of 
efficacy need not be reported as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646611]. All admissions to a health care facility meet this criteria, even if less than 24 hours. Criteria for seriousness a re also met if transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646612] / surgical care ( eg, medical floor to the intensive care unit [ICU]). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57714]  
• Nursing facility  
• Emergency Room 
• Same day surgery  
Page 61 of 104 
Alexion Confidential  
Protocol ECU -NMO -302, Amendment 6  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
22 March 2018  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57715]; 
examples include:  
• Admission for a pre-existing condition not associated with either a new AE or with worsening of a pre -existing AE  
• Protocol- specified admission  
• Pre-planned admission 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedures  
Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (invasive and non-invasive) such as surgery or angiography should not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the medical condition or the diagnosis that was responsible for the procedure should be recorded. The procedure should be 
recorded in the narrative as treatment for the AE or SAE ; for example: “Laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy is the procedure or treatment for an SAE of necrotic gall bladder ”. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Othe r Adverse Events  
Other AEs (OAEs) will be identified by [CONTACT_646660]. 
Significant AEs of particular clinical importa nce, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to 
discontinuation of the patient/subject from the trial, will be classified as OAEs. For each OAE, a 
narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity Assessment  
AE severity will be ra ted by [CONTACT_57746], moderate, or severe using the following 
criteria:  
• Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s 
daily activities.  
• Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns wi th the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe: events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Change in severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. 
Severity and seriousness must be differentiated. Severity describes the intensity of an AE, while 
the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteria for an SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causality Assessment  
An Investigator causality assessment (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite) must be provided for all AEs (both serious and non-serious). This assessment must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF and any additional SAE forms as appropriate. The definitions for 
the causality assessments appear below.  
Page 62 of 104 
Alexion Confidential  
Protocol ECU -NMO -302, Amendment 6  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
22 March 2018  
• Not related (unrelated): This relationship suggests that there is no association between 
the IP and the reported event. 
• Unlikely related: This relationship suggests that the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_65082] a cause other than the IP but attribution cannot be made it absolute 
certainty and a relationship between the IP and AE cannot be excluded with complete 
confidence.  
• Possibly related: This relationship suggests that treatment with the IP may have 
caused or contributed to the AE, ie,  the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of IP administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the IP, 
but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604]. 
• Probably related: This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the IP administration exists and the likely association of the event with 
the IP. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of the IP, known or 
previously reported adverse reactions to the IP or class of drugs, or judgment based 
on the PI ’s clinical experience.  
• Definitely related: Temporal relationship to the IP, other conditions (concurrent 
illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of disease state) do 
not appear to explain event, corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile, improvement on discontinuation, re- appearance on re- challenge.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure during Pregnancy and Lactation  
Pregnancy data will be collected during this trial extension for all patients.  
Investigational product exposure during pregnancy must be recorded and followed. Exposure 
during pregnancy, also called exposure in -utero (EIU) , can be the result of either maternal 
exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure. 
If a patient or a patient’s partner becomes or is found pregnant while treated or exposed to 
eculizumab, the Investigator must submit a pregnancy form to the Sponsor via the same method 
as SAE reporting. The Sponsor will supply the Investigator with a copy of a “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form / Breast Feeding”. The Sponsor must be notified via the same 
method as SAE reporting. 
Exposure of an infant to IP  during breastfeeding need s to be reported in the “Pregnancy 
Reporting and Outcome Form / Breast Feeding”, and any AE an infant may experience following 
breastfeeding needs to be reported to the Sponsor. 
The patient  or patient’s pa rtner  should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality), even if 
the patient discontinued IP or discontinues from the trial. When the outcome of the pregna ncy 
becomes known the form should be completed and returned to the Sponsor. If additional follow-
up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_389334] a contraceptive medication. However, complications of 
pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and may meet criteria for a SAE. 
Page 63 of 104 
Alexion Confidential  
Protocol ECU -NMO -302, Amendment 6  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
22 March 2018  
Complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy such as ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death or congenital anomaly would 
meet criteria of an SAE and thus, should be reported as an SAE. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Withdraw due to an Adverse Event  
Withdrawal due to an AE or SAE event must be clearly differentiated from withdrawal due to 
other reasons. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Obtaining Adverse Event  
The Investigator must collect all AEs observed, obtained by [CONTACT_646661] t he trial patient.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Period  
For SAEs the reporting period to the Sponsor begins following the patient’s signing of the ICF 
(providing consent to participate in the trial) and continues through [ADDRESS_865785] dose of IP (Day 1)  and continues 
through the last visit, including the safe ty Follow-up Visit. AEs, particularly causally related, are 
to be followed until the event or sequalae resolve or are determined to be medically stable. [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
All AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_646662]. If 
criteria are met for an SAE the event must be reported to the Sponsor as per  SAE reporting  
requirements in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 , Serious Adverse Events. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Reporting Requirements for Non -serious Adverse Events  
All non-serious AEs must be recorded in the e CRF  system upon awareness or prior to the next 
patient visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
For SA Es, the 
Sponsor must be notified immediately or with in [ADDRESS_865786]. These 
reporting timelines need to be followed for all initial SAE cases and follow -up versions to the 
initial case.  
In the event that either the electronic data capture (EDC) or the Safety Gateway is unavailable at the 
site(s), the SAE must be reported on paper. The Investigator must complete, sign, and date the 
SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the 
corresponding source documents, and send a copy via Email or fax to contact [CONTACT_207625]:

Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be sent via the Safety Gateway 
to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee within [ADDRESS_865787] records and/or trial file.  For all SAEs the Investigator must provide the following: 
• Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed above  
• Causality of the serious event(s) 
• Outcome of the serious event (s) 
• Medical records and laboratory / diagnostic information 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor or legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria as per regional and local regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for trial Investigators. It is 
the PI ’s responsibility to notify the IRB or Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) of all SAEs that

15. STATISTICS  
Anal yses will be produced using the data from this trial alone as well as combined analyses that 
will include data from the ECU -NMO-301 trial. The analyses will include safety, efficacy, and 
PK/PD analyses. The statistical analysis plan will cover both the standalone trial analyses and the 
combined ECU- NMO-301 and extension trial ( ECU -NMO-302) analyses.  
15.1. General Considerations  
ECU -NMO-302 is an extension of the Phase 3 Trial ECU- NMO-301. At the completion of the 
trial, the Sponsor will analyze the trial data. Analyses will be produced using the data from this 
trial alone as well combined analyses that will include data from the ECU -NMO-301 trial. The 
analyses will include safety, efficacy, and PK/PD analyses. The statistical analysi s plan will 
cover both the standalone trial analyses and the combined ECU- NMO-301 and ECU- NMO-302 
trial analyses.  
The Sponsor will be responsible for data collection and editing, reviewing and validating all the 
information in the eCRFs, statistical analy sis, and generation of the clinical report.  
Prior to locking the database, all data editing will be complete d and decisions regarding the 
evaluability of all patient data for inclusion in the statistical analysis for the extension t rial and 
Combined Per -Protocol (Combined PP) Set s will be made. The rationale for excluding any data 
from the statistical analyses will be prospectively defined, and classification of all or part of a patient's data as non -evaluable will be completed before the statistical analys is is begun. The 
statistical analysis will not begin until the entire database is locked and signed -off. 
The Alexion Biostatistics Department will perform the statistical analysis of the data derived from this trial. The analysis will be performed using the SAS® statistical software system Version 9.[ADDRESS_865789] deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. 
Graphical displays will be provided as appropriate. 
15.2. Determination of Sample Size  
This is an extension trial to ECU -NMO-301 trial. A maximum of 132 patients will be enrolled in 
the ECU -NMO-301 trial . Patients who complete the ECU -NMO-301 trial may  participate in this 
extension trial.  
15.3. Analysis Sets

efficacy analyses will be performed on the Combined Full Analysis Set ( Combined FAS) 
Page [ADDRESS_865790]- IP-infusion efficacy assessment.  
15.3.2. Extension Trial Per-Protocol Set Population 
The Extension PP population is a subset of the Extension FAS population, excluding patients with major extension trial protocol deviations. The Extension PP population will include all 
patients who: 
• Have no major protocol deviations or key inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that 
might potentially affect efficacy  
• Took at least 80% of the required treatment doses during participation in the extension trial  
15.3.3. Combined Full Analysis Set Population 
The Combined FAS population, on which primary, secondary, and tertiary efficacy analyses will 
be performed , consists of all patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_865791]- IP-infusion efficacy assessment.  
15.3.4. Combined Per -Protocol Set Population 
The Combined PP population is a subset of the Combined FAS population, excluding patients with major protocol deviations from either the ECU- NMO-301 or extension trial. The Combined 
PP population will include all patients who: 
• Have no major protocol deviations or inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that 
might potentially affect effica cy 
• Took at least 80% of the required eculizumab doses during participation in ECU -
NMO-301 and/or this trial 
The Extension PP population as well as the Combined PP population will be determined prior to database lock.  
15.3.5. Extension Safety Set Population  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Extension Safety Set Population and the Combined 
Safety Population from both studies. The Extension Safety Set Population includes all patients 
who receive at least [ADDRESS_865792] 1 dose of eculizumab in trial ECU -NMO- 301 or this trial.

15.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
All demographic and baseline characteristics information will be summarized using the 
following sets: Extension FAS, Extension PP, Combined FAS, Combined PP, Extension Safety 
Set, and Combined Safety Set . No formal hypothesis testing will be performed. Summary 
statistics will be presented.  
15.5. Patient Disposition and Treatment Compliance  
The number of patients, treated, completing the trial, and included in the safety and efficacy 
analysis sets will be tabulated by [CONTACT_646663] . Reasons for any 
patient withdrawals will b e provided. 
Treatment compliance with IP will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The extra usage of IP for patients who are treated with PE during the trial will be summarized and listings will be 
produced. 
15.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized. Listings of prior and concomitant 
medications will be produced. 
Supportive ISTs are allowed during the trial. Thus, supportive IST treatment will be summarized . 
Listings of supportive ISTs will be produced. Changes in ISTs during the trial will be 
summarized.  
For patients with On -Trial Relapses, the use of methylprednisolone and PE  will be summa rized 
by [CONTACT_1570]. Listings of methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and plasma exchange usage by [CONTACT_646664] -Trial Relapses will be produced. 
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODrug). 
15.7. Efficacy Analy ses 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Extension FAS population as well as the Extension PP population. In addition, Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Combined FAS population as well as the Combined PP population from the combined ECU- NMO-[ADDRESS_865793] met its 
primary efficacy endpoint if a statistically significant p -value (< 0.05) is obser ved for the change 
in ARR between the baseline ARR and the On-Trial ARR when on eculizumab treatment in ECU -NMO-[ADDRESS_865794]. Confidence intervals (95%) for the change 
and percentage change in the ARR will be presented. The percent age of patients who are relapse -
free based on On -Trial Relapse events while on eculizumab treatment in ECU -NMO-302 along 
with 95% confidence intervals will be computed using the Kaplan- Meier method. A sensitivity 
analysis will be performed for the change in ARR between the baseline ARR and the adjudicated 
Page [ADDRESS_865795]. The percentage of patients who are relapse- free while on eculizumab treatment in ECU -
NMO-302 along with 95% confi dence intervals will also be computed using the Kaplan -Meier 
method for the adjudicated On- Trial relapses.  
 
Additional analyses will be performed on the combined data from ECU- NMO -301and ECU-
NMO-302 trials. Baseline ARR for all patients will be calculated starting 1 year prior to enrollment in the ECU -NMO -301 trial and will include all On -Trial attacks (as identified by [CONTACT_3786]) that occur in the ECU- NMO-[ADDRESS_865796] will be used to assess the change in ARR between the baseline ARR and the On -
Trial ARR when on eculizumab treatment. Confidence intervals (95%) for the change and percentage change in the ARR will be presented. The percentage of patients who are relapse -free 
based on On- Trial Relapse events while on eculizumab treatment along with 9 5% confidence 
intervals will be computed using the Kaplan- Meier method. A sensitivity analysis will be 
performed for the change in ARR between the baseline ARR and the adjudicated On- Trial ARR 
when on eculizumab treatment using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. The percentage of patients who are relapse -free while on eculizumab treatment along with 95% confidence intervals will 
also be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method for the adjudicated On- Trial relapses . 
15.7.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis for the Trial Period  
Note: Baseline for the extension trial alone is defined as the last available assessment prior to 
starting treatment with eculizumab in the extension trial.  Baseline for the combined trial efficacy 
analyses is defined as the last available assessment prior  to starting treatment with eculizumab in 
ECU -NMO- 301 or this trial for all patients.  
Changes from baseline for the various secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized over the applicable visits.  
• Change from baseline in EDSS score  
• Change from baseline in EQ- 5D  
• Change from baseline in mRS  score 
• Change from baseline in HAI  in patients with abnormal baseline ambulatory function  
• Change from baseline in VA in patients with abnormal baseline visual function 
The primary analysis for the change from baseline in EDSS score at a particular visit for will be 
based on the repeated measures model with effects for baseline EDSS and visit. Changes from 
baseline in the HAI , VA, EQ -5D index score, EQ- 5D visual analog scale, and mRS score will be 
analyzed in a similar manner as changes in EDSS score using the baseline and visit as covariates 
in the modeling. In addition, summary statistics for the changes from baseline in the mRS  score 
will be produced by [CONTACT_765]. Likewise, shift tables from baseline in the mRS  score will be produced 
Page 71 of 104 
Alexion Confidential  
Protocol ECU -NMO -302, Amendment 6  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
22 March 2018  
by [CONTACT_765]. By -patient listings of the secondary endpoints assessments and changes from baseline in 
the secondary endpoints will be produced. 
For the secondary endpoints, some summaries by [CONTACT_646628]. Patients will 
belong to one of four possible subgroups:  
(a) patients randomized to eculizumab who did not have relapses in the ECU- NMO-301 trial,  
(b) patients randomized to eculizumab who did have relapses in the ECU- NMO -301 trial,  
(c) patients randomized to placebo who did not have relapses in the ECU- NMO -301 trial, and  
(d) patients randomized to placebo who did have relapses in the ECU- NMO-301 trial.  
 For the patients in sub-group (a), baseline is defined as the baseline assessment (last available 
assessment ) prior to dosing in the ECU- NMO- 301 trial. For the patients in sub-group (c), 
baseline is defined as the last available assessment prior to dosing with eculizumab in this trial. For the patients in subgroups (b) and (d), baseline for these subgroup analys es is defined as the 
last available assessment prior to eculizumab dosing in this extension trial in consideration of 
neurologic changes and recoveries as a result of relapse in  the ECU -NMO-301 trial. Changes 
from baseline for the various secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized separately for the 
4 subgroups of patients over the applicable visits.  
Missing secondary endpoint assessments will not be imputed.  
15.7.3. Tertiary Efficacy Analysis for the Trial Period  
Like the secondary efficacy endpoint, the tertiary endpoint analyses will be based on changes 
from baseline.  
• Change from baseline in HAI  score  
• Change from baseline in VA  
• Change from baseline in the SF-36  
• Change from bas eline in the EDSS FSS  
Changes from baseline in the HAI score and VA will be analyzed in a similar manner to the 
secondary endpoint analyses described for HAI with abnormal baseline ambulatory function and 
VA with abnormal baseline visual function using repeated measures models.  
Change from baseline in QOL  will be summarized as appropriate to the QOL  instrument and 
analyses will be performed as specified in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP).  
Changes from baseline in the EDSS FSS will be analyzed in a similar manner to the secondary 
endpoint analyses described for the EDSS score using repeated measures model . 
In addition, summaries of changes from baseline like those for the secondary efficacy endpoints 
will also be created for the tertiary efficacy endpoint s for the 4 subgroups of patients from the 
ECU -NMO- 301 trial who are treated in the extension trial.

15.7.4. Other Efficacy Analyses: On -Trial Relapses  
For patients with a PI -determined On -Trial relapse(s), summary tables of the types of relapses 
and the severity of the relapses will be produced. Summary tables will also be produced only for 
those patients with adjudicated On- Trial relapse(s). A by -patient listing of the On -Trial relapses , 
including the adjudication outcome will be produced. The severity of a rela pse will be 
determined using the OSIS scale. Severity will be assessed at the time of the relapse.  
Changes from baseline to all of the trial collected time -points after a relapse (and before the next 
relapse if the patient happens to have more than one rel apse) will be summarized for EDSS, HAI , 
and VA. Changes from the last assessment prior to the relapse to all trial collected time -points 
after a relapse (and before the next relapse if the patient happens to have more than one relapse) 
will be summarized f or EDSS, HAI , and VA. Likewise, changes from the assessment 1 week 
after the relapse to all trial collected time  points after that time point (and before the next relapse 
if the patient happens to have more than one relapse) will be summarized for EDSS, HA I, and 
VA. These summaries will be produced for patients with a PI- determined On -Trial relapse(s) as 
well as for only those patients with adjudicated On- Trial relapse(s).  Patient listings for the 
EDSS, HAI , and VA assessments before and after a relapse wi ll be created for the patients with 
all On -Trial relapses  as determined by [CONTACT_978](s ), including the subsequent adjudication outcome. 
15.8. Safety Analyses

not be imputed unless indicated in the described analysis in the SAP.  
Page [ADDRESS_865799] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
16.1. Trial Monitoring  
Before a study site can enter a patient into the trial, a representative of the Sponsor  or its 
designee will visit the investigational trial site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee or 
its representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between the 
Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee and the Investigator. 
During the trial, a monitor from the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee or representative will 
have regular contacts with the study site, for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the Investigator (s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm t hat the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being performed 
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the e CRFs  
with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to 
the trial. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (e.g. clinic 
charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor or the 
Sponsor’s designee. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on e CRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or IEC . 
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator (s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
16.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee or its representative, a 
regulat ory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, 
including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and 
independently examine all trial- related activities and documents to dete rmine whether these 
activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according 
to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH), and 
any applicable regulatory requirements. The Inves tigator  should contact [CONTACT_47399]’s designee immediately if contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
Page [ADDRESS_865800] /Independent Ethics Committee  
The PI , or Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee, depending on country requirements, must obtain 
IRB/IEC  approval for the investigation. Initial IRB /IEC  approval, and all materials that have 
been submitted and approved by [CONTACT_1201] /IEC  for this trial, including the patient ICF form and 
recruitment materials , must be maintained by [CONTACT_7213]. 
16.4. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will conduct interim monitoring of unblinded safety data. Since its 
primary function will be to ensure patient safety, the DMC will have access to all safety data.  
The DMC may make recommendations to the Sponsor regarding safety issues, trial conduct, and modifying, extending or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. A separate DMC Charter will document all DMC procedures and processes for the trial.

requirements, the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee or its representative may conduct a quality 
assurance audit. Please see Section 16.[ADDRESS_865801] submit a copy of the written approval to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee 
before he or she can enroll any patient/subject into the trial.  
The PI , or Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee, depending on country requirements, is responsible for 
informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol in accordance with local 
requirements. In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all advertising used to recruit patients 
for the trial. The protocol must be re-approved by [CONTACT_55398], per  local regulations.  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_646613]. The Sponsor or the Sponsor’s 
designee will provide this information to the PI . 
Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB or IEC according to local regulations and guidelines. 
18.2. Ethical Conduct of the Trial  
The trial will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, applicable 
regulato ry requirements.  
18.3. Written Informed Consent  
The PI (s) at each center will ensure that the patient is given full and adequate oral and written 
information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the trial. Patients must also be 
notified that they are free to discontinue from the trial at any time. The patient should be given 
the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
The patient’s signed and dated ICF must be obtained before conducting any trial proc edures.  
The PI (s) must maintain the original, signed ICF. A copy of the signed ICF must be given to the 
patient.  
Local regulations should be followed for blind or other disabled patients. If there are not clear 
requirements, it is strongly recommended that at the very minimum an impartial witness or, if 
applicable, a Legal Guardian, is present during the consent process and signs the consent., Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_646614]/IRB the recommended consent process for

APPENDIX 3: KURTZKE EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCALE 
(EDSS)  
 
The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  (5) is a method of quantifying dis ability 
in multiple sclerosis. The EDSS replaced the previous Disability Status Scales used in Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS).  
The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS) and allows neurologists to 
assign a Functional System Score (FSS) in each of these. The Functional Systems are:  
pyramidal  
cerebellar  
brainstem  
sensory  
bowel and bladder visual 
cerebral  
other 
EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with MS who are fully ambulatory. EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 
are defined by [CONTACT_298195].

SUICIDAL IDEATION  
Actu al Attempt: 
A pote ntially self- injurious act commi tted with at least so me wish to die, as a resu lt of act. Behavior w as in part thou ght of 
as method to kill oneself. I ntent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to d ie associated w ith the act, then it 
can be cons idered an actu al suicide attempt. There  does not have to be  any injury or  harm , just the potent ial for 
injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broke n so no injury results , this is considered an 
attemp t. 
Inferring  Intent: Even if an in dividual  denies intent/wish to die, it m ay be inferred clinical ly from the behavior or 
circumsta nces. For ex ample, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accid ent so no other intent but suicide can be inferred 
(eg, gunshot to head, jumpi [INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if someo ne denies intent to die, but they thought 
that what they did could be lethal, inte nt may be inferred. 
Have you m ade a suicide attempt?

Protocol 10 September 2020
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 2017-04-07 72 INTRODUCTION
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy. Up to one 
third of women with GDM will have persistently abnormal blood sugars postpartum, and up to 
70% will develop diabetes later in life. In order to diagnose persistent postpartum dysglycemia 
and future risk of type 2 diabetes, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), American College 
of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), and World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that 
all women with GDM undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 6-12 weeks postpartum 
[1-3]. However, this screening occurs in less than half of women diagnosed with GDM. Thus, 
standard of care for screening for postpartum dysglycemia is not occurring for the majority of 
women. A more feasible and convenient alternative for screening is needed. This study aims to 
assess the feasibility of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) compared to OGTT for the 
diagnosis of postpartum dysglycemia in women with recent GDM.
2.[ADDRESS_944394] of care, postpartum OGTT screening for women with GDM is 
not performed in the majority of women. Previous research has tried to address promotion and 
incentivizing of OGTT testing, but has only achieved screening rates of up to 60% [5]. 
Alternative testing strategies have failed to achieve the desired feasibility and predictive value 
needed. The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of a postpartum 10 day CGM study for 
detection of postpartum diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and impaired fasting glucose 
(IFG). CGM will be placed on discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696046] [ADDRESS_944395] of care OGTT and to assess 
for predictors of non-completion.
GDM is common and is a risk factor for future dysglycemia. GDM complicates 7% of 
pregnancies and is one of the most common complications of pregnancy [2]. Though for many 
women GDM resolves at delivery, up to one third of women with GDM will have diabetes or 
IGT at postpartum screening, and up to 70% will develop diabetes later in life [2]. Early 
diagnosis of dysglycemia allows early interventions which have been shown to decrease the risk 
of progression from IGT to diabetes, including weight loss, physical activity, breastfeeding, and 
pharmacologic interventions [6]. Postpartum screening can also be an opportunity to optimize 
health before future pregnancies to decrease the risk of maternal and fetal complications in 
addition to the long term risks of diabetes. Newly discovered, previously undiagnosed type 2 
diabetes is associated with previous history of GDM, and is associated with increased perinatal 
risks when compared with GDM including perinatal mortality (OR 2.3), preterm birth (OR 2.6), 
congenital anomalies (OR 2.1), neonatal intensive care unit admission (OR 3.1) and neonatal 
hypoglycemia (OR 406) [7].

Postpartum dysglycemia screening with Dexcom G6 Version 1.1
Protocol 10 September 2020
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_944396] dysglycemia. Screening for diabetes and IGT using a 75-g, 2 hour OGTT 
is recommended by [CONTACT_696055], ACOG, and WHO at 
6-12 weeks postpartum [1-3, 8]. Unfortunately, postpartum screening at this time only occurs in 
17-60% of women even during studies designed to promote testing [9-11]. In a randomized 
control trial, Clark et al found that postal reminders to patients and physicians in led to an 
increase in screening by [CONTACT_696056] 14.3% tested by [CONTACT_696057], 
51.6% with a reminder to the physician, 55.3% with reminder to patient, and 60.5% with 
reminder to physician and patient (p<0.05) [5]. Implementation of this strategy at two Canadian 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696047], but not as robustly as seen in the original 
randomized control trial described above [9], with 28% OGTT completion by 6 months with 
reminders compared with 14% completion with usual care (p=0.1) [12]. The DIAMIND study in 
Australia found that a reminder at six weeks did not increase screening by [CONTACT_696058] 
[13]. Multiple interventions have been studied at Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: after implementation of 
an advanced order set at the 35-week pregnancy visit, provider education modules, and 
nutritionist phone calls reminding patients to fast before postpartum testing, OGTT test 
completion in association with a six week postpartum visit increased from 17% to 36% (p=0.01) 
[10]. 
Increased interaction with a healthcare system and health literacy are associated with higher 
likelihood of postpartum testing [9, 11]. The strongest predictor of effective postpartum diabetes 
screening is attendance at postpartum healthcare visits [9]. The influence of race and ethnicity on 
postpartum screening rates is not consistent across studies [14], but in general there are strong 
associations of poor postpartum screening compliance with minority race, ethnicity, younger age, 
mental health disorders, and lower health literacy [11]. These disparities contribute to higher 
rates of undiagnosed diabetes in these populations which will have long term consequences on 
the women and their communities. During the COVID-[ADDRESS_944397] been recommended [15]. In the [LOCATION_002], no 
change in guidelines has been formally proposed; if it were, it could be expected to lead to 
further declines in postpartum screening, as women with lower health literacy and less access to 
healthcare having poorer follow up.
Alternative testing has not been able to replace postpartum OGTT. In theory, simpler screening 
tests might be considered, but these have proven inferior to the OGTT for postpartum 
dysglycemia screening. For example, fasting glucose values alone fail to capture some women 
with IGT and diabetes. A meta-analysis found a fasting glucose had a sensitivity of 16-89% 
compared to OGTT (the best sensitivity was a study performed 4-8 years after delivery) [16]. 
Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) measurements might seem a reasonable surrogate screening tool, but 
HbA1C can be lowered by [CONTACT_696059] [3, 17]. One year after delivery, HbA1C compared to an OGTT has a 
reported sensitivity of 22.64% and PPV of 54.55% [17].

Postpartum dysglycemia screening with Dexcom G6 Version 1.1
Protocol 10 September 2020
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_944398] been found to 
improve by [CONTACT_661387] 1-5 (median day tested: postpartum day 2) [18]. The authors of that 
study concluded that the majority of improvements in metabolism occur in the immediate 
postpartum period [18]. An analysis of multiple studies looking at the accuracy of immediate 
postpartum OGTT before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696048] (95.7%) and negative 
predictive value (NPV) (98.1%) for diabetes diagnosis, but performed sub-optimally when IFG 
and IGT were included (specificity 50.5%, NPV 75.3%) [19]. For women who receive steroids 
before or during labor, the impact on blood glucose levels would still be present on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19156] 
2, so postpartum days 3-10 would likely perform better. 
CGM for screening for dysglycemia in other populations. Chen et al found a strong correlation 
between CGM values and venous blood values during OGTT testing in otherwise healthy 
participants with fasting blood glucoses between 70-200 mg/dL [20]. In other populations where 
HbA1C cannot be depended on for diabetes diagnosis, such thalassemia, use of CGM for 
diagnosis has been studied [21]. CGM detected more IGT and diabetes than OGTT in a study of 
cystic fibrosis patients [22].
CGM metrics in healthy volunteers have been established. Analysis of CGM in participants 
without diabetes has found very low percentages of time above 180mg/dL (median 0%, IQR 0-
0.2%), above 160mg/dL (median 0.3%, IQR 0.1-0.9%), and above 140 mg/dL (median 2.1%, 
IQR 0.9-3.9%) [23]. Overnight monitoring, defined as midnight to 5:59am, the rates of time 
above these thresholds were even lower (IQR ranges 0-0%, 0-0%, and 0-1%, respectively), and 
time spent in the range 70-120mg/dL was 94% (IQR 88-97%) [23].
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS
Participants using the CGM will be at low risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of 
the sensor needle placement.  If a catheter is left under the skin for more than 24 hours it is 
possible to get an infection where it goes into the skin, with swelling, redness and pain.  There 
may be bleeding where the catheter is put in and bleeding under the skin causes a bruise (1 in 10 
risk).  In less than [ADDRESS_944399] a small portion of 
the sensor under the skin that may cause redness, swelling or pain at the insertion site. 
Some participants may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure 
the CGM.  If these reactions occur, different adhesives or "under-tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]" (such as with IV 3000, 
Tegaderm, etc.) will be tried, sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topi[INVESTIGATOR_696049]. 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM sensors are 
inserted under the skin.  It is possible that any part that is inserted under the skin may cause an 
infection.  These occur very infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_696050].

management behaviors.  Some people may be uncomfortable with the researchers' having such 
detailed information about their daily diabetes habits.
Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk; however, standard operating procedures will be 
followed as detailed in section 9.1.[ADDRESS_944400] benefit to the 
participants. CGM data can be shared with the participant or their providers after their OGTT at 
the participant’s request which could provide benefit to the participant. 
It is expected that this protocol will yield increased knowledge about the feasibility of using 
CGM as a screening tool for DM after GDM. If this is feasible, screening could increase in 
frequency and ease.

number of participants.
5.5 SCREEN FAILURES
If participant meets an exclusion criteria after enrollment, such using steroids, their data will not 
be included in analysis. 
5.6 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
Since up to 40% of women do not attend any postpartum visits [11], our study recruitment and 
retention will need to be optimized. Participants will be recruited from their routine obstetrics 
and endocrinology visits and also from the postpartum labor and delivery floor. Consent will be 
translated into Spanish, and interpreters will be used to increase potential recruitment and recruit 
a more diverse and representative study population. We believe the availability of remote visits 
will decrease burden on participants, will increase retention for women who do not wish attend 
postpartum visits, and will address potential limitations on research visits at study sites due to 
COVID-19 concerns. The option for visit 2 to be performed either on the postpartum floor or 
remotely will allow recruitment of women who are delivering at multiple locations. 
Compensation will be provided for time and effort. Participants will receive $25 after Visit 1, 
$75 after Visit 3 and an additional $[ADDRESS_944409] OGTT. We estimate 
that 50% of participants will complete their standard OGTT with reminders and incentives; the 
enrollment goals have been planned accordingly.

7.1 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
7.1.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators will apply the 
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related.  An adverse 
event is considered related if there is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the 
adverse event and the study intervention, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_2299]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the adverse 
event follows a known pattern of response to the study intervention; and/or the adverse event 
abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study intervention or dose reduction and, if 
applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
An adverse event is considered unrelated if evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology 
other than the study intervention (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible 
temporal relationship to study intervention.
7.1.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)
 The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three-point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse 
event is not necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but 
may not be clinically serious.
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.
All adverse events including adverse events that continue after the study participant's 
discontinuation or completion of the study will be followed until their medical outcome is 
determined or until no further change in the condition is expected.
Reporting Serious Adverse Events, Unexpected Adverse Device Effects
Any untoward occurrence that:
• Results in death.
• Results in transmission of a bloodborne pathogen.
• Is life-threatening; (a non-life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might 
have become life-threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event).
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
• Is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] 
(e.g., may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the endpoints listed above).

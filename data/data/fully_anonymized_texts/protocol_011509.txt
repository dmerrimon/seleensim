II. Introduction  Single-sided deafness (SSD) can be defined as moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss with limited speech perception benefit in one ear and normal hearing in the contralateral ear. Though one ear is within the normal hearing limits, SSD results in reduced speech perception in noise (Welsh et al, 2004; Rothpletz, Wightman & Kistler, 2012), variable abilities on localization tasks (Slattery & Middlebrooks, 1994), increased report of hearing handicap (Iwasaki et al, 2013), and reduced quality of life (Wie, Pripp & Tvete, 2010).  This patient population cannot utilize conventional amplification due to the severity of the hearing loss and poor speech discrimination abilities in the affected ear. Current treatment options include: contralateral routing of the signal (CROS) hearing aids, and bone-conduction devices. A CROS hearing aid is a two-part system that includes a microphone/transmitter on the affected ear and a receiver on the normal hearing ear. The microphone/transmitter sends the acoustic signal from the affected ear to the receiver, which is presented to the normal hearing ear. Bone-conduction devices utilize a percutaneous, implanted titanium abutment to send the acoustic signal from the affected side to the normal hearing ear via vibrations.  The goal of both of these technologies is to send the signal from the affected side to the normal hearing side, thereby [CONTACT_607022] a unilateral listening condition.  Though CROS hearing aids and bone-conduction devices provide the patient with auditory information from both sides to the better hearing ear, the ability to use binaural cues for speech perception in noise is variable (Kunst et al, 2007), and localization abilities have been found to be at chance (Bosman et al, 2003; Hol et al, 2010). For instance, Bosman et al (2003) compared three listening conditions in SSD subjects: unaided, CROS hearing aid and bone-conduction hearing aid. Subjects were allowed [ADDRESS_804240] whether cochlear implantation of the affected ear would benefit the SSD population. A cochlear implant is a two-part system, including the internal electrode array and external speech processor. The internal electrode array is surgically implanted into the affected cochlea. The external speech processor receives sounds and transmits this signal to the internal portion. The electrode array presents the acoustic signal via electrical pulses within the cochlea, which is interpreted by [CONTACT_607023]. A steady growth in speech perception acquisition has been reported in conventional cochlear implant subjects up to 6-12 months of listening experience with the external speech processor (Pelizzone, Cosendai, & Tinembart, 1999). Presumably, cochlear implantation may provide the SSD population improvements in speech perception in the affected ear, which cannot benefit from appropriately fit hearing aids. Cochlear implantation may provide a benefit over current treatment options in the SSD population, as it stimulates the auditory pathway on the affected 
side, thus allowing for ipsilateral representation of acoustic signals arriving to each ear independently.   Bilateral stimulation of the auditory system has been shown to improve speech perception in spatially-separated noise and localization abilities. These gains have been reported in bilateral cochlear implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (van Hoesel & Tyler, 2003; Nopp, Schleich & D’Haese, 2004; Grantham et al, 2007).  For instance, Grantham et al (2007) assessed the localization abilities of bilateral cochlear implant subjects at approximately [ADDRESS_804241] whether the performance acquisition would be different in an SSD case with cochlear implantation since there is the added benefit of a normal hearing ear.  Cochlear implantation has been reported as a viable treatment option in cases of unilateral hearing loss, including sudden sensorineural hearing loss (Firszt et al, 2012), and severe tinnitus (Vermiere & Van de Heyning, 2009; Van de Heyning et al, 2008). Further, cochlear implantation has been shown to offer superior speech perception in noise, localization abilities, and subjective report in SSD cases as compared to CROS hearing aids and bone-conduction devices (Arndt et al, 2011). The limitation to this comparison, however, was the subjects had limited listening experience with the alternative treatment options (i.e. CROS hearing aids or bone-conduction device). Though other studies reported no difference in abilities with these technologies after 4 weeks of listening experience (Bosman et al, 2003), long-term duration of listening experience may influence speech perception and localization abilities. Considering this, a control condition of long-term users of current treatment options (i.e. bone-conduction devices) may provide a more accurate comparison with SSD cochlear implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The primary goal of this project is to determine whether subjects with SSD experience an improvement in speech perception, localization, and quality of life with a cochlear implant as compared to an unaided listening condition. Secondary aims include: 1) a comparison of speech perception, localization, and quality of life outcomes in the study population to a SSD control group with long-term listening experience with a current treatment option (i.e. bone-conduction device), and 2) a within-subject comparison of speech perception and localization abilities with cochlear implantation versus the bone-conduction test device.  III. Objectives  A. The primary purpose of this feasibility study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of cochlear implantation in subjects with SSD 1. Postoperative results will be evaluated with speech perception measures, localization tasks, and subjective reports  
B. Compare outcomes of cochlear implantation to that of current treatment options (i.e. bone-conduction devices) for SSD cases 1. Compare speech perception, localization, and subjective outcomes to a control group of implantable bone-conduction device recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 2. Assess cochlear implant subjects with a bone-conduction test device and/or previous BAHA device at the preoperative and [ADDRESS_804242] speech perception and localization abilities between the cochlear implant and bone-conduction device  IV. Definitions  Adjusted Constant Error: the rms deviation of the mean responses from the diagonal, computed after compensating for bias. This procedure reduces the bias when evaluating the relationship between the average response on the azimuth and signal source on the azimuth.  Bimodal: Cochlear implant in one ear and a conventional hearing aid in the contralateral ear  Bone-Conduction Device: A device on the poorer hearing ear that pi[INVESTIGATOR_607004]. This is accomplished by [CONTACT_607024] a headband or via a percutaneous, implanted titanium abutment.   Cochlear Implant (CI): A two-part system, including the internal electrode array and external speech processor that stimulates the auditory pathway on the effected side. The internal electrode array is surgically implanted into the affected cochlea. The external speech processor receives sounds and transmits this signal to the internal portion. The electrode array presents the acoustic signal via electrical pulses within the cochlear space, which is interpreted by [CONTACT_607023].  Constant Error: the rms deviation of the average responses from the source positions  Contralateral Routing of Signal (CROS) Hearing Aids: A two-part system consisting of a transmitter microphone on the deafened ear and a receiver on the normal hearing ear. The transmitter sends the signal from the deafened ear to the normal hearing ear. The auditory pathway on the normal hearing ear receives the sound.  Interaural Level Difference (ILD): The difference in sound level between the two ears, dependent on the location of the sound source and the orientation of the head. This binaural cue is typi[INVESTIGATOR_607005].  
Interaural Timing Difference (ITD): The difference in the time a sound arrives to one ear as compared to the other, dependent on the location of the sound source and the orientation of the head. This binaural cue is typi[INVESTIGATOR_607006].   Pure Tone Average (PTA): The average threshold (dB HL) from 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz  Random Error: the standard deviation of responses at each signal source position, averaged across all potential signal sources  Root-Mean-Square (rms) Error: The difference between the location on the azimuth of the sound source and the subject’s response on each trial for the localization task  Single-Sided Deafness (SSD): Severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss with limited speech perception in one ear and a normal to mild hearing in the contralateral ear  V. Investigational Device  A. Subjects will be implanted with the commercially available MED-EL CONCERT cochlear implant with the standard electrode array (MED-EL Corporation, Innsbruck, Austria). The device consists of a stimulator, a coil with a magnet within its center, a reference electrode, an EAP reference electrode and an active electrode permanently attached to the stimulator. The electrode is made of medical grade silicone, platinum (electrode contacts) and platinum/iridium (90/10) wires and nitinol.  The purpose of the device is perception of environmental sound and potential for improvement in communication abilities.  For the adult population, the MED-EL CONCERT cochlear implant is indicated for those [ADDRESS_804243] pair. The electrode’s length allows insertion into the scala tympani and stimulation of the cochlear canal to the fullest extent possible. The array features a marker ring 31.[ADDRESS_804244] been implanted with a MED-EL cochlear implant.  The Opus 2 
audio processor consists of the control unit with the earhook attached, the battery pack frame and cover, the connecting pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], the coil and the coil cable.  The audio processor uses batteries that provide sufficient power for both the external and the implanted electronics.  The MAESTRO 6.0 Fitting Software will be used to program the Opus 2 speech processor. The MAESTRO 6.0 software, which is used for different intraoperative and postoperative purposes for the MED-EL Cochlear Implant System. Currently, it contains the implant Telemetry and Fitting of the OPUS 1 or OPUS 2 processor, ART (Auditory nerve Response Telemetry) and ESRT (Electrically Evoked Stapedius Reflex Threshold), and Audiogram functions.  The MAESTRO software is an external component of the MED-EL Cochlear Implant System and is intended to be used in a clinical or office environment by [CONTACT_607025]-EL cochlear implants.  VI.

Demonstrate the effectiveness of cochlear implantation in SSD subjects   1. Demonstrate an improvement in speech perception abilities, localization, and/or subjective benefit in an aided (cochlear implant on) versus an unaided (cochlear implant off) condition  B. Cochlear implantation provides similar or superior speech perception, localization, and/or quality of life as compared to that found with bone-conduction devices  1. Comparison with control group performance 2. Comparison within subject when listening with bone-conduction test device  IX. Statistical Analysis  A. Descriptive summaries will be provided for the following: subject demographics, and frequency of major and minor complications/adverse events.  B. A single-subject design will be utilized, where each subject serves as his or her own control, for analysis of objective and subjective results. A single-subject design was chosen in order to accommodate the heterogeneity that is well known to characterize auditory prosthesis research. Repeated-measures ANOVA will be calculated with a p-value of ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_804255]-initial activation intervals  a. Comparison of the difference between the aided and unaided conditions for each follow-up interval b. Compute the overall rms error, random error, constant error, and adjusted constant error, as described by [CONTACT_607029] (2007)  3. Comparison of subjective report scores in the post-initial activation intervals  C. The incidence of interference between ears will be assessed by [CONTACT_607030] 0° azimuth conditions for the contralateral ear only versus cochlear implant + contralateral ear conditions for each subject, as well as the individual’s subjective report.  A sample size for the cochlear implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_607012] 20 subjects was selected due to known variability in conventional cochlear implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_607013] (approximately 20%). A comparable study, Hansen, Gantz & Dunn (2013) evaluated 29 cochlear implant subjects with SSD, which included etiologies of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, Meniere’s disease, and vestibular schwannoma. Authors reported a high degree of variability in their sample. This project will not enroll all of the etiologies included in the Hansen, Gantz & Dunn (2013) analysis (such as, Meniere’s Disease with intractable vertigo or history of vestibular schwannoma), therefore a smaller sample size was selected. The inclusion/exclusion criteria associated with this study, as compared to the heterogeneity of the Hansen, Gantz, & Dunn (2013) subject sample, will allow for more generalized comments about subjective and objective outcomes of cochlear implantation in cases of SSD.  If needed, statistical consultation will be sought from the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (TraCS) or UNC Odum Institute.  X. Endpoints  A. Safety endpoint 1. The primary safety endpoint is the evaluation of Adverse Events. All Adverse Events will be reported to the UNC IRB. If the UNC IRB or study investigators deem an Adverse Event unacceptable, then this would result in termination of the study.  B. Primary effectiveness endpoint 1. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the comparison of speech perception, localization abilities and/or subjective report when the cochlear implant is on versus off.  XI. Risk Analysis

Current hearing device options, including CROS hearing aids and bone-conduction devices, would still be available to the subject in the future if the subject does not benefit from the cochlear implant or elects to no longer use the cochlear implant. a. The test battery includes a listening condition to assess the monaural performance of the contralateral ear. Interference of the cochlear implant on the performance of the contralateral ear can be evaluated by [CONTACT_607031] + contralateral ear conditions when tested at 0° azimuth, as well as, review the subjective benefit via the subjective questionnaires. If interference is found to impact speech perception and subjective benefit, the subject may elect to discontinue use of the cochlear implant and would still have access to currently approved technologies for SSD. 2. Magnet strength will be assessed at each interval to ensure comfort at the coil site. 3. Reports of pain from the external speech processor placement will be addressed by [CONTACT_607032] (i.e. moleskin between the external speech processor and the subject’s ear, or different battery-wearing options to lighten weight on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_24277]). 4. Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_607016]-initial activation interval to improve audibility and comfort of the sound quality from electric stimulation. 5. The MED-EL cochlear implant has MRI limitations*. Subjects may have CT scans or x-ray imaging postoperatively when warranted. a. *The MED-EL CONCERT cochlear implant is approved for MRI of 0.[ADDRESS_804256] prior to implantation. Subjects will be counseled regarding meningitis vaccinations and directed where to obtain them by [CONTACT_607033].  XII. Potential Benefits  A. Improvement in speech perception abilities in noise with the cochlear implant due to utilization of auditory cues from both ears.  B. Improvement in localization abilities with the cochlear implant due to utilization of auditory cues from both ears.  C. Improvement in subjective benefit with the cochlear implant as compared to preoperative performance.  
 The potential benefits of cochlear implantation in cases of SSD are suspected to outweigh the risks listed in Section XI.A. The study sample will include subjects with previous history with current hearing technology options for SSD, who are dissatisfied with this technology and/or have discontinued use of the technology. This sample is similar to those in previously published reports who have benefited from cochlear implantation.   This study also includes a comparison to a currently approved technology option for SSD, bone-conduction technology. This comparison will be used to assess outcomes between technologies, but also to determine whether individual subjects experience differences in performance between the two technologies. The risks associated with cochlear implantation in this population are also reduced considering subjects may continue to use currently approved technologies for SSD if they do not obtain subjective and objective improvements from cochlear implantation.  XIII. Adverse Events  A. Anticipated versus Unanticipated Events 1. Anticipated Events: those events described as potential risks (section XI.A.) of the protocol  2. Unanticipated Events: events not reported as potential risks (section XI.A.) a. Unanticipated serious adverse events are defined as any serious adverse event related to the health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that event, problem, or death that was not previously defined in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the literature or investigational plan. It can also include any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  3. Serious Adverse Event: Serious injury means an injury or illness that: 1) is life-threatening, 2) results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or 2) necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment to a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  a. Permanent means an irreversible impairment or damage to a body structure or function, excluding trivial impairment or damage.  b. Revision cochlear implantation will be considered a serious anticipated adverse event.  B. Reporting adverse events 1. All adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_607017]. Combined adverse events will be listed in an excel spreadsheet. Frequent adverse events will be discussed with co-investigators.  2. Anticipated events will be reported to the FDA in the annual report  
3. Unanticipated events will be reported to the FDA and UNC IRB within [ADDRESS_804257] from the study for any reason, this will be discussed in person during a scheduled evaluation. Subjects may also be withdrawn if residual hearing changes in the contralateral (better hearing ear) to a moderate hearing loss of worse. In either scenario, the subject will continue to receive care irrespective of their participation in the study.  C. Investigative Team 1. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_607018], including determining candidacy. 2. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_607019]. 3. Responsibilities for all study team members will be recorded in a Study Delegation Log. Not all team members will be responsible for all activities. 4. Communications between the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_607020]. 5. Source data will be maintained with completed Case Report Forms (such as, speech perception score sheets) when available.  XV. Confidentiality  A. Subjects will be assigned a specific, anonymous subject number that will be associated with his or her data. Database entry will be by [CONTACT_117789]. All personal identifiers will be kept in a separate, secure data file that will be password protected and not associated with the study data. Only investigators will have access to the subject numbers.  B. Subject specific binders will be maintained in a locked cabinet in the Carolina Crossing research lab. Individual data collection sheets will be coded with the subject number and placed in the subject specific binder at each interval. For analysis, the data will not included identifiable information.  
C. Data will not be shared outside the investigative team except during reporting of anonymous results.  D. After the closure of the study, subject data will be retained for seven years. At that time, paper data will be shredded and destroyed in a HIPAA compliant manner. Electronic data will be destroyed following UNC policy.  E. A description of the clinical trial will be available on http://ClinicalTrials.gov. This web site will not include information that can identify research subjects.

Compared to general anesthesia, spi[INVESTIGATOR_463574], cardiopulmonary complications, and the need for blood transfusion.[ADDRESS_593810], each with its own unique pharmacologic properties. In this prospective randomized trial, we will determine if a short-acting spi[INVESTIGATOR_463575], mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], leads to earlier postoperative ambulation following primary hip replacement surgery compared to two other formulations of another long-acting spi[INVESTIGATOR_463576], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].   Note: The Research Plan, A through E, should not exceed [ADDRESS_593811] the long-term objectives and what 
2  the proposed research will accomplish.  (Suggested length: a paragraph or two)  The specific aims of this study are to compare isobaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], hyperbaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and isobaric mepi[INVESTIGATOR_463577]:  1. Percentage of patients ambulating at 3 hours (primary outcome) 2. Return of sensory and motor function of lower extremities, incidence of hypotension, urinary retention, transient neurological symptoms (TNS)  3. Postoperative pain levels, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], percentage of patients able to meet discharge criteria on same day, length of stay  Hypothesis: we hypothesize that a greater percentage of patients will ambulate early in the mepi[INVESTIGATOR_463578].  B.  Background and Significance  Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_72159] a shorter duration of action than bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Although some early studies suggested that mepi[INVESTIGATOR_463579], also known as transient neurological symptoms (TNS), mepi[INVESTIGATOR_463580] a spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163]4 and more recent studies have refuted that.[ADDRESS_593812] been missed as a result. Both hyperbaric and isobaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_463581] a variety of surgeries and there appears to be no difference in the failure rate of the two drugs.6 Even when used in low doses, both provide adequate anesthesia for greater than 60 minutes, which is the expected surgical time for this study. We will be using “low-dose” bupi[INVESTIGATOR_463582]. Early ambulation is known to facilitate better functional recovery and reduce the incidence of some postoperative complications after hip surgery. A shorter-acting spi[INVESTIGATOR_463583]. Shorter time to ambulation could lead to faster discharge, which is desirable by [CONTACT_463606].   C.  Preliminary Studies/Progress Report   Existing evidence is limited by [CONTACT_463607]5 and the inherent confounders and lack of controlling that were present. A review comparing isobaric to hyperbaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_463584] a slower onset and longer duration.6 A prospective, randomized trial comparing two doses of isobaric mepi[INVESTIGATOR_463585]-
3  day discharge and no patients experienced TNS.7 Two separate studies in patients having ambulatory surgery found that TNS was rare after spi[INVESTIGATOR_463586].8,9 However, none of these studies compared all 3 local anesthetics in the same study and they did not study the total hip arthroplasty population.  D.  Research Design and Methods Describe the research design and procedures to be used (what, when, how) Include the duration of participation and early termination criteria.  Provide a flow diagram or timetable.  Procedures, situations, or materials that may be hazardous to personnel and the relevant precautions, should be outlined here. (suggested length not more than 2 pages)  This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study comparing 3 different local anesthetics for spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]. All patients between the ages of 18 and 85 years of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-3, scheduled for elective total hip arthroplasty with one of three board-certified orthopedic surgeons (Hozack, Austin, Brown) and who have no contraindications to spi[INVESTIGATOR_463587]. Eligible patients will be called the night before to discuss the purpose and description of the surgery. Those who express interest will be approached the morning of surgery to discuss in more detail and consent will be obtained. A computer-generated randomization sequence will be used to assign patients to one of the three groups. The group assignment will then be shared with the anesthesia team caring for the patient. The surgeon, patient, and study team doing post-op assessments will remain blinded. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_463588], in which case the patient will be positioned in lateral position with surgical side up (isobaric mepi[INVESTIGATOR_463589]) or surgical side down (hyperbaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]). Patients receiving isobaric drugs will sit for 3-[ADDRESS_593813] intervention, and adequate spontaneous ventilation. Hypotension will be treated at the discretion of the intraoperative anesthesia team for blood pressure more than 20% lower than the preoperative reading. As per institutional protocol, all patients without contraindications or allergies receive acetaminophen and gabapentin preoperatively and for [ADDRESS_593814] anterior approach (Hozack and Brown) and lateral approach for Austin. Any spi[INVESTIGATOR_463590].

Assessment of patient satisfaction with anesthesia Postoperative day 2 Assessment for TNS in person if in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_463593] 90 days Query of Epic to determine if 90-day readmission occurred   Postoperatively, patient sensory and motor assessments will occur every 30 minutes until strength returns to 5/5 in hip flexion, knee extension, and toe dorsiflexion. The sensory dermatome where numbness is detected at that time will be noted. Patients will be asked on POD 0, 1, and 2 about presence of TNS as defined above: “Do you have any back pain that you didn’t have before surgery that goes into your buttocks, thighs, hips, or lower leg?”  Urinary retention will be defined by [CONTACT_463608] 8 hours OR a report of distended or painful bladder occurring on POD 0, either by [CONTACT_463609].  90-day readmissions will be queried in Epic.  E.  Statistical Methods   If not a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], provide biostatistical design, power calculations determining the number of participants, and the proposed analysis. (suggested length: ½ page)   The study was powered using estimates of the study’s primary endpoint which is the percent of patients successfully ambulating within a 3-hour window post-surgery.  The time window is based on realistic expectations of when Physical Therapy assessments will be performed with a near [ADDRESS_593816] ambulation within 3 hrs in 70% of patients for mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 35% of patients for hyperbaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and 25% of patients for isobaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. With a one-way ANOVA for 3 groups and alpha set at 0.05, the study will require 44 patients per group (N=132) to achieve 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups in the percent of patients ambulating within 3 hours. Allowing for a 10% dropout and screen failure rate the study will require a total of 144 patients.   
6   F.  Gender/Minority/Pediatric Inclusion for Research All protocols must include documentation of the inclusion of women and minorities in the research protocol. If women and minorities are not to be included, provide rationale for exclusion.  Women and minorities will be included in this research protocol.   G.  Human Subjects 1.  Provide number, age range, and health status of the subject population.  List criteria for inclusion or exclusion.   This study will include [ADDRESS_593817] a contraindication to spi[INVESTIGATOR_463594] (BMI) greater or equal to 40 kg/m2. Patients with pre-existing neuropathy in the lower extremities will also be excluded and any patient deemed a poor study candidate by [CONTACT_463610]. Patients in wheelchairs and those who cannot ambulate [ADDRESS_593818] device will be excluded. Those who take greater than the equivalent of 25 mg IV morphine (oxycodone 30 mg) daily will be excluded.   2.  Identify sources of research material in the form of specimens, records or data.   All data will be from interviewing patients before and after surgery and from review of Epic record (TJUH) or Meditech record and paper records (ROSH) from their admission. Rothman databases may be accessed if data are missing from Epic.  3.  Describe plans for recruitment and consent procedures to be followed.  As described above, patients will be called the night before surgery to discuss purpose of study and determine if further steps and official consent should take place on the day of surgery. Patients expressing interest by [CONTACT_463611], risks and benefits, and any questions. If available, family members will be involved in consent process as well. 4.  Describe risks and assess likelihood and seriousness.  One risk of the study is premature resolution of spi[INVESTIGATOR_463595] (unlikely and moderate severity). The other main risk is that early ambulation could put patients at risk for falls, although this risk is minimized by [CONTACT_463612][INVESTIGATOR_463596]. 5.  Describe procedures for protecting against or minimizing potential risks.  Only patients who are undergoing primary unilateral hip arthroplasty with one of [ADDRESS_593819] a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (see DHSP policy G 616 “Independent Monitoring of Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trials.”   [CONTACT_463613] will be the independent study monitor.

Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            7 
 1.  Introduction and Rationale 
 
Broader indications for the implant of cardiac implantable electronic devices  (CIED), a 
higher prevalence of systolic heart failure and population aging are the main reasons for the 
continuous increase in the use of pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy .  The rate of infection is out of proportion to 
the increase in implantation rate.  T his is thought to be primarily due to the associated 
comorbities in CIED patients, the greater complexity of the devices, and the increased duration of procedures.   
 
The CanGaroo  ECM Envelope is a ‘pouch’ in which a cardiac implantable electronic device 
is placed prior to implantation to create a stable environment and to provide a barrier between the CIED and the soft tissue of the patient and a barrier from the CIED leads.  
 
CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. received FDA 510(k) premarket clearance for the CanGaroo  
ECM (K140306) on August 15, 2014.  This post market observational study will evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of  CanGaroo  ECM following  an implantable electronic device 
procedure utilizing  CanGaroo  ECM.  Specific data will be collected at the first post-
operative visit.  
   
 
2. Indication for Use   
The CanGaroo  ECM Envelope is intended to securely hold an implantable electronic device 
to create a stable environment  when implanted in the body. The devices that may be used 
with the CanGaroo  ECM Envelope include pacemaker pulse generators , defibrillators, or 
other cardiac implantable electronic  device.  The entire Instructions for Use ( IFU) can be 
found in Appendix C. 
 
3. Description   
 
The CanGaroo  ECM is constructed from a multilaminate sheet (4 -ply) of decellularized, non-
crosslinked, lyophilized extracellular matrix  (ECM) derived from porcine small intestinal 
submucosa (SIS).  SIS is a natural collagen construct derived from a select layer of tissue that 
is recovered from porcine small intestine.  During processing, the inner and outer muscle layers of the intestine are removed, leaving an intact, de cellularized , submucosa with a 
portion of the tunica propria layer attached to the inner surface.  The CanGaroo  ECM 
Envelope will be provided sterile and is intended for single use in a single patient only.  Over time, the device will be reinforced by [CONTACT_654716]. 
  
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            [ADDRESS_878598]- market clinical 
study is ongoing.  The ECM for Pericardial closure has been studied in a randomized, 
prospective study to evaluate its ability to reduce the incidence of new onse t atrial 
fibrillation; the ECM for Carotid Repair is under evaluation in a post-market study to capture and assess device performance data from subjects undergoing patch angioplasty of the carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy using the product per its FDA -cleared 
Indications for Use; and a post market study to capture additional information (RECON) from subjects undergoing a procedure requiring pericardial closure using the product per its FDA-cleared Indications for Use.   
 
4.1.Clinical Evaluation of the ECM Pericardial Closure Device  
 
The ECM Pericardial Closure device was evaluated in a multicenter,  prospective, 
randomized, controlled clinical study, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to reduce the incidence of new onset post operative atrial fibrillation by 
[CONTACT_654717], first-time, coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) procedures as compared to the control group subjects who did not undergo pericardial closure.   Safety was to be established by 
[CONTACT_654718].  Effectiveness was to be established by [CONTACT_5024] a reduced incidence of new onset post-operative atrial fibrillation in the ECM group as compared to the control group.  440 patients at 15 U.S. sites were enrolled between December 2010 and November 2012 and randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the ECM group (pericardial closure) or the control group (no pericardial closure).  A blinded, independent core 
laboratory evaluated all arrhythmia data to determine if subjects met the effectiveness 
endpoints.  A blinded, independent Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all safety  
endpoint events.  Pa tients were evaluated at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 30 days and 270 days 
postoperatively.  Subjects were adults (at least 18 years of age) with no prior history of 
atrial fibrillation or history of anti -arrhythmia drug treatment in the past three months and 
no implantable cardiac devices (i.e., cardiac resynch ronization therapy devices with and 
without defibrillator capabilities  [CRT-Ds and CRTs), implantable cardioverter -
defibrillators [ICDs] and pacemakers)  undergoing isolated, first -time CABG with a 
median ster notomy approach.  
 
The primary  effectiveness en dpoint, superiority of the ECM over no pericardial closure 
for reduction in the incidence of new onset post- operative atrial fibrillation,  was not met. 
The study results showed that the rate of new onset post-operative atrial fibrillation for the primary effectiveness endpoint was similar between the two groups, with a rate of 38.3% in the ECM group compared with 35.9% in the control group.  The two secondary effectiveness endpoints, the rate of treated or sustained epi[INVESTIGATOR_654709] (defined as a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_654710] 15 minutes or more) and the rate of treated epi[INVESTIGATOR_654711]. 
 
Protocol 14- PR-1110D                                                                                                            9 
  
The composite primary safety endpoint event rates for the ECM and control group were 
3.9% and 3.7%, respectively.  Using the pro tocol specified non- inferiority margin, 7.5%, 
the ECM was shown to be non- inferior to control for the primary safety endpoint 
(p<0.001).  Therefore, the primar y safety endpoint for the study was achieved.  The 
composite secondary safety  event rate was similar for the two groups (5.8% for the ECM 
group com pared with 3.9% for the control group) demonstrating no significant increase 
in the rate  of by[CONTACT_654719]. 
 Although the study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of new onset post-operative atrial fibrillation, the study demonstrated that the ECM for Pericardial Closure continues to be safe for its intended use, with no significant increase in the rate of by[CONTACT_654720].  
4.[ADDRESS_878599]- market registry study for the ECM for Carotid 
Repair (Protocol No. 11- PR-1021).  The objective of this registry is to capture and assess 
device performance data from subjects undergoing patch angioplasty of the c arotid artery  
following carotid endarterectomy using the ECM for Ca rotid Repair per its commercial 
Indications for Use.  This registry provides an ongoing post- market surveillance 
mechanism to document clinical outcomes on the use of the ECM for Carotid Repair.  This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, post- market, observational registry of 
subjects receiving the ECM for Carotid Repair for patch angioplasty following carotid endarterectomy procedures.  This post-
market registry may involve up to ten U.S. clinic al sites and up to [ADDRESS_878600] in the analysis was the rate of pseudoaneurysm, which was present in 2 (1.08%) of the 186 patients and compared favorably to the rates found in the literature (1.4% to 5%). 
The mean carotid stenosis (maximum) at pre -operative was 84.8%.  Mean change from 
baseline values were -56.8%, -57.9%, and -59.6% at the 1 to 3-month, 6-month, and 12-
month follow-up evaluations.  The mean carotid stenosis (minimum) at pre -operative was 
71.7%.  Mean change from baseline values were -63.9%, -61.2%, and -63.4% at the 1 to 
3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up evaluations. 
 As a result of this analysis and the directed and ongoing risk management activities, the overall residual risk of the ECM for Carotid Repair is determined to be a cceptable.

An Adverse Device Effect  is defined as a clinical sign, symptom, or condition that is 
causally related to the device procedure, the presence of the device, or the performance of 
the device.  Due to the temporal proximity of the AE to product administration, there is a reasonable possibility that the product may have caused the AE or may have contributed to the severity or duration of an event caused by [CONTACT_11174].   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is defined as an event that:  a) led to death, b) led to serious 
deterioration in health that either:  
1) Resulted in life threatening illness or injury, or 
2) Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, or 
3) Required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
4) Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
 A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered to be a serious event.

12.[ADDRESS_878607] retention.  (Appendix D :  Investigator Qualifications and 
Responsibilities)  
 Data quality will be monitored through review of submitted data to identify and follow up on missing data, inconsistent data, or incomplete data.  Critical data points such as adverse events or infection will be reviewed with the site via telephone and/or email and if required, on- site monitoring will be conducted.  All communication with the 
investigator and study staff related to monitoring and data collection will be documented per the Monitoring SOP.  Monitoring and related activities  will be performed by [CONTACT_501151]. 
    
12.2 Ethics Committee / Institutional Review Board Approval and Oversight  
 
The Investigator must obtain appropriate Ethics Committee (“EC”) or Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval before the study can be initiated .  The Sponsor will 
submit the protocol and i nformed consent to a centralized  IRB for approval.  If the 
Investigator chooses to use the centralized IRB , the Investigator will be responsible for 
completing the initial review form for the Sponsor to submit o n their behalf.  If the 
investigator chooses to us their own IRB, the sponsor will provide support for the compi[INVESTIGATOR_654712].  A copy of the written approval from the EC/IRB and a copy of the approved Informed Consent Form (approved Waiver of Documentation of Consent, if applicable) should be sent to Aziyo .  Appropriate study 
progress reports will be prepared for the EC/IRB by [CONTACT_079]. Any changes to the protocol must be discussed and approved by [CONTACT_654727].  In the non -emergent setting, after 
agreement on the changes has been reached, an amendment to the protocol will be provided by [CONTACT_654728]/IRB for review and approval prior to 
initiation of the change.  Any change made emergently must be documented in the

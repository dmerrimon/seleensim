RESEARCH STRATEGY  
 
A. Specific Aims  
As our nation seeks a healthcare system that provides timely, equitable and patient -centered care, appropriate use of 
emergency departments (EDs) is a focus  of national attention .1–[ADDRESS_835099] increasingly served as portals for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] , contributing to care fragmentation 
and ED crowding.4 Of the  1.5 million non-elective pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626580],  75% originate in EDs. 
The remainder occur via direct admission, defined as admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626581]’s ED .[ADDRESS_835100] admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626582]’ homes or from primary care or 
specialty clinics, typi[INVESTIGATOR_626583]. 
While ED utilization patterns have been well studied, there is a paucity of research comparing the effectiveness of direct 
and ED admissions, particularly in children .4,6,[ADDRESS_835101] admission processes are  associated with improved timeliness of clinical 
care for adults with acute myocardial infarction  (AMI).8–[ADDRESS_835102] admission  approach  to admission  
beginning in the ED for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304] . We will achieve this goal by [CONTACT_626675]:  
Aim 1. Determine the effect of a pediatric direct admission  intervention on timeliness of healthcare provision, family 
experience of care, and rates of clinical deterioration compared to pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626584].  
Hypothesis 1 : Direct admission will be associated with more rapid initiation of clinical care  (our primary outcome ) and 
improved family experience of care with no significant differences in rates of clinical deterioration (as measured by [CONTACT_626676] (ICU)), compared with admission beginning in the ED.  
Aim 2. Identify the pediatric populations and conditions that experience the greatest benefits from direct admission 
with respect to timeliness of healthcare provision and family experiences of care. Hypothesis 2: Children with urinary 
tract infections  (UTIs) , skin and soft tissue infections  (SSTIs) , and co -morbid complex chronic illness will experience the 
greatest benefits from direct admission  with respect to timeliness of care provision and family experience of care.  
Aim 3. Applying mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementing 
direct admission processes.  We will apply the RE -AIM implementation framework using mixed methods to carefully 
assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and m aintenance of the intervention, as well as multi -level 
assessment of barriers of and facilitators to implementation.24 
We will accomplish these Aims by [CONTACT_14664] a stepped-wedge cluster rand omized control led trial (RCT) to compare the 
effectiveness of direct and ED admission at 3 structurally and geographically diverse hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], randomizing 70 practice  
sites in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ catchment area to crossover to the d irect admission intervention at  [ADDRESS_835103] admission.

every child and ad ult who requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based care . Approximately two million children are admitted to hosp itals in 
the [LOCATION_002] each year.25 These hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626585], incurring healthcare costs that represent 40% of all 
national pediatric healthcare expenditures.26,[ADDRESS_835106] major implications for patients’ and 
families’ quality of life, disrupting normal routines, resulting in time lost from work and school, and contributing to both 
financial and emotional stress.28 These stressors are disproportionately experienced by [CONTACT_626677], 
who account for more than 50% of pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626586].[ADDRESS_835107] decade, research determining quality of care at the tim e of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626587] .
30–[ADDRESS_835108] dedicated significant resources to improving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91676]: the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality supported a major initiative to re -engineer discharge practices, the Centers for 
Medicaid and Medicare transfor med payment structures with a focus on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], and national physicians 
organizations developed a Transitions of Care Consensus Policy Statement.30,33,34 Accordingly, t he phrase “transition of 
care” is widely understood to describe the changes in setting, healthcare providers, and disease management strategies 
experienced by [CONTACT_626678]. Like hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626588], handoffs between healthcare providers , and changes in medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . Both are associated with significant 
stress to patients and their families.29,[ADDRESS_835109] 
been the focus of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626589]: unstructured patient handoffs, poor communication between healthcare providers, and inefficient care. However, almost no research has aimed to improv e transitions of care into the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  
Direct admission accounts for 25% of all unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626590], with significant variation in rates of direct admission across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626591] .
[ADDRESS_835110] 
admission rates for unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626592] 8.9% for appendectomy to 38.0% for bipolar disorder.5 
Findings from  this quantitative analysis are  mirrored in our national survey of pediatric medical directors, with  97% of 
respond ents reporting that they accept pediatric direct admissions ; direct admission rates ranged  from <10% to >50%.[ADDRESS_835111] , while 50% reported their belief 
that more children should be admitted directly. This significant variation across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626593], emphasizing the value of our proposed research . 
Evidence Gaps  
Our systematic review of outcomes associated with direct admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147937] a paucity of research focused on children . In this recently completed review (manuscript currently being prepared), we identified [ADDRESS_835112] admission processes of care compared to admission through EDs.
5,8– 23,36,[ADDRESS_835113] admission systems targeting  adult patients with signs and 
symptoms of AMI. Of the 14 studies focused on this population, 13 reported timeliness of care outcomes, and 12 of the 
13 reported more rapid definitive clinical management in adults who were directly admitted compared to those 
admitted through EDs .8–[ADDRESS_835114], by [CONTACT_626679], found that adults with sepsis experienced higher mortal ity when admitted directly than when admitted through EDs.
23 The second, 
a study of unscheduled adult hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a variety of common conditions, found that patients admitted directly had higher mortality for time-sensitive conditions such as AMI and sepsis; t hese differences were not observed among 
adults admitted less with emergent  conditions including pneumonia, asthma and cellulitis.

admission incurred healthcare costs 5 -31% lower than ED admission.[ADDRESS_835118]- and ED -admitted children  at a single children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , found  no 
significant differences in rates of ICU transfer between the groups .38 Based on this syste matic review, we conclude: (i) 
studies examining the comparative effectiveness of direct and ED admission are primarily focused on adult populations 
with heart disease; it is unknown if the results of these studies will translate to other populations;  (ii) the vast majority 
of existing studies are cohort studies at high risk of bias based on application of a validate d risk of bias assessment tool; 
and (iii) s tudies in children, a PCORI priority population, are under -represent ed in the existing literature .  
Completion of our proposed research has the potential to fill existing evidence gaps . Our proposed study represents 
the first RCT  study to compare the effectiveness of direct and ED admission. Second, o ur rigorous design  will examine 
admission processes and outcomes across the diversity of settings where children are admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: at two  
children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s and one general  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626595].[ADDRESS_835119] and ED 
admission processes. Historically, many pediatric patients were adm itted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626596] 
(PCPs)  or specialists who continued to provide their medical care  during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626597].[ADDRESS_835120] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626598] . Pediatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] M edicine  (PHM), the 
pediatric specialty dedicated to the inpatient care of children,  is the fastest growing specialty in pediatrics ; an increasing  
number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626599] -house for up to 24 hours a day.41–[ADDRESS_835121] and ED admission, and 
articulated a desire for standardized admission processes  (Inset quote) . Consistent with the Institute of Medicine’s 
domains of healthcare quality, parents’ described the importance of timely, effective, safe, and patient -centered clinical 
care, and expressed variation in their experiences with direct and ED admissions in achieving these aims.[ADDRESS_835122] important to them.29 We   “The process needs to be standardized. We currently 
have an open policy regarding direct admissions and 
utilize them according to our judgment. It would be 
useful to have a policy regarding suitable and unsuitable 
candidates for direct admission.” (Pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8384])

Finally, we convened a panel of 9 experts representing these stakeholder groups, nominated  via national organizations. 
Using a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi approach, stakeholders prioritized processes and outcomes to evaluate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626601]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626602].44 Our proposed study is built  directly upon this 
formative work, implementing both  processes and outcomes  prioritized by [CONTACT_626680]  ( Table 
Key stakeholders in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626603] -making processes are included in our study teams and advisory 
panels to ensure that our study processes and outcomes align with diverse stakeholder needs.  Key stakeholders in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626604], together, often  
recognize t he need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266], ED physicians, resident physicians and nurses are key 
decision-makers influencing whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614] o ccur 
via direct or ED admission. At each of our three partner sites, we 
have therefore convened teams comprised of a senior health 
services researcher , a PHM clinical leader, and PCP and Parent 
Partner s. If funded, these Direct Admission Leadership Teams  
(DALTs) , will expand to include nurses, resident physicians (when 
applicable), complex care physicians, administrators, and practice 
managers. These site-based teams will be supported by a central 
research team and a national D irect Admission Advisory Panel 
(DAAP ) that has co ntributed to our preliminary work.39 We 
provide examples of how these results will inform clinical decisions in Table 2.  Table 1. Outco mes prioritized by [CONTACT_626681][INVESTIGATOR_626605] , these will be evaluated in our proposed research . 
Outcome  Repres entative Quotation (stakeholder)  
Total time from the time 
of arrival at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626606]  “Sometimes the good thing is you get a lot of the tests a lot faster because it is in the ER and they need to get results pre tty 
quickly to determine where they need to go from there. That is kind of a real benefit. That's why my doctor sent him to the E R 
too.” (parent)  
“I just feel like she gets better quicker because she doesn’t have to wait for so long…We go [for direct admission] and I know she 
will have an IV in her in an hour versus if we go to the emergency room it could be three to four hours before she has that I V.” 
(parent)  
“I think my biggest concern would be a child arriving on the floor and having no one see them for a period of time and having 
them get very sick before someone - either a nurse or a physician - to go in and see them. I mean I see that as the biggest 
potential risk. Making sure that if we do accept the direct admission, there is some person - some staff - free to go and assess 
that patient right away.” ( Inpatient nurse)  
Patient and family 
experience of care  
 “I had brought a copy of the x -ray with me, but they wanted their own copy.  So then they took another one…If I had my dream 
admission, the pediatrician…  would have called somebody here and said, ‘This is what I saw on the x -ray. I'm e -mailing you a 
copy of it. Pull it up on your screen. He or she would have pulled it up on the screen and said ‘Yes, I concur. Have them com e to 
Floor [ADDRESS_835124] the room ready.’  That would have been my perfect admission. ” (parent)  
“… I’m making a generalization, but from our experience, when you’re in an ER situation people a re just more stressed out... Like 
how could you not be? ... And you might be on a stretcher with like curtains between each of you... Whereas, this is much more 
comfortable in terms of knowing like you’re coming right from a doctor’s office to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626607]’s ready for you, there’s a 
bed, there’s a nurse re ady to come help you with needs.  She might have other patients but she’s not running around like an ER  
nurse. ”  (parent)    
Unanticipated transfer for  
pediatric intensive care 
within 6 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517]  "Did the patient present as billed? …Were they discharged from the floor in a few hours because they were less acute than 
anticipated? Or were they transferred to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]?” (Inpatient nurse)  
 "That final outcome is really the patient recovery... How soon, how quick, how complete, is the recovery. And any readmission  
down the road. Any complications. Like escalated to ICU? All those are of interest in addition to patient and family experien ce..." 
(Primary care provider)  
Rapid response calls within 
6 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517]   “It's just that we, in our head, are thinking ‘Ok, what's the worst this patient could look like?’ Because we don't want the patient 
to come to the floor and then have a Rapid Response…” (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8384])

A child is seen by [CONTACT_626683] a skin infection that has not gotten better with oral antibiotics. The pediatrician thinks the child needs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Should the pediatrician send the child to the emergency department for 
evaluation, or will the child receive more timely, safe and/or 
patient -centered care with a direct admission?  
A pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626608] a call from a primary care provider

D. Study Design or Approach  
1. Summary. We will conduct a stepped -wedge cluster randomi zed control led trial to evaluate  outcomes associated 
with a direct admission intervention at three health systems : Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21815] ( CHP)  in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], 
Pennsylvania, Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (NCH ) in Columbus, Ohio, and Providence Regio nal Medical Center  (PRMC -
E) in Everett, W ashington. We have partnered with these health systems  given their  structural diversity, current low 
direct admission rates, and strong insti tutional support to implement and evaluate direct admission processes . A total of 
70 practices affiliated with these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626610] (usual care at these 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) to the direct admission intervention at [ADDRESS_835127]. Our p rimary outcome  will be timeliness of clinical care provision. Secondary outcomes include family -
reported experience of care and two measures of clinical deterioration:  unplanned transfe r to the ICU and rapid 
response calls within [ADDRESS_835128] admission referrals . Our research approach reflects these prerequisites and is modified from  Donabedian’s 
structure, process, outcome framework to also incorporate  patient characteristics and family preferences  (Figure 1).45 
This framework illustrates how systems factors and processes of care may influe nce where children  access ambulatory  
care  for acute illnesses  (ED or primary care clinic)  and whether admission  occurs directly or through the ED. These 
factors, in turn, influence health outcomes. The System Factors summarized in this model, including clinic and ED factors,  were described by [CONTACT_626684][INVESTIGATOR_626611] : Leyenaar, JoAnna, Kristine

care for their child’s acute illnesses.29 The Processes of Care factors are derived from deliberative discussions with 
stakeholders in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626612] ,39 as well as our systematic review of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626613].  
Finally, the health outcomes shown were prioritized by [CONTACT_626685].39 Accordingly this conceptual  
framework reflects a process of intensive stakeholder engagemen t in the development of our research question and in 
selecting our primary and secondary outcomes . From this Conceptual Framework, our Causal Model may be 
summarized as follows: We hypothesize that, by [CONTACT_626686] , exposure t o the often hectic ED 
environment, and  reducing the number of healthcare teams involved in care provision, directly admitted children will 
have reduced time to clinical care and improved experiences. The relative benefits of direct admission may differ based 
on medical complexity, with complex patients , often well known to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based  healthcare teams , more likely to 
receive timely , personalized care. Primary reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626614], with 
conditions requiring minimal diagnostic testing prior to treatment initiation  (for example UTIs and SSTIs)  having the 
greatest benefit f rom direct admission.29,[ADDRESS_835130] admission intervention is available (including children admitted directly and through EDs) 
to those admitted from practices not yet eligible for the intervention (hence all ED admissions).  B oth ED and direct 
admission are in current clinical use, with national statistics showing that 25% of children with unplanned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626615] 75% ar e admitted through EDs.5 Children who are transferred 
from another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (inter -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788]) will be excluded, given our inability to account for types and duration of 
healthcare received at the transferring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626616], and the validity  of 
this variable  has been demonstrated in two previous studies .46,[ADDRESS_835131]  admission intervention will involve five core elements, all of which were 
prioritized by [CONTACT_626687] l multi stakeholder panel in our preliminary work:39 (i) direct admission education an d tools for 
both referring healthcare providers ( PCP practices) and accepting healthcare providers (nurses, resident physicians and 
pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266]) , including diagnoses  and populations eligible for direct admission, and patient referral methods; 
(ii) a system to facilitate direct communication between referring and accepting healthcare providers,  enabling a single 
telephone call from a referring physician to an accepting physician  (currently in place at all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626617] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788]) , and use of a structured data collection tool to facilitate determination of the 
appro priateness of the patient for direct admission; (iii) instructions for families regarding when/where/how to proceed 
for direct admission; (iv) rapid evaluation of clinical stability of the patient upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626618] ; and (v) timely initiation of appropriate clinical care. These five core elements will be augmented by 
[CONTACT_626688] -stakehold er panel and detailed in Appendix A.[ADDRESS_835132] agreed to implement the above-described core elements , but we

 [ADDRESS_835134] site. As a result, during the pre-rollout period each site’s  DALT 
will meet wit h the central research team to adapt the  core elements as needed while concurrently maintaining  high 
implementation fidelity. This process will be informed by [CONTACT_626689]. , 
engaging mult iple stakeholders to take into account the local context and resources .48 During  the pre-implementation 
period, each DALT will meet monthly via conf erence call with the central research team to discuss the core and 
supplemental  intervention elements within the context of local system, organization, provider, and patient 
characteristics .48 These discussions will be supported by [CONTACT_626690][INVESTIGATOR_626619], with tailoring of  educational materials  and tools  as appropriate . During the implementation phase, the DALT 
and central research team will meet quarterly to discuss implementation fidelity and the need for potential adaptation.  
Covariates. In addition to the above-described co mparators, we will evaluate , at baseline , patient -level characteristics 
that may be associated with portal  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. These include: child age, gender, race/ethnicity, primary payer 
(Medicaid, commercial, other), primary reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (clinical condition), medical complexity , and level 
of care (observation or inpatient status) . Medical complexity will be  categorized as no concurrent chronic illness, chronic 
non-complex illness (i.e.  diabetes, asthma), 
or complex chronic disease (i.e. 
neuromuscular disease, technology 
depen dence ) by [CONTACT_626691] 
(PMCA).49 All variables will be extracted  
from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626620]-rollout period.

Justification for Study Design.  Our proposed S WD, like a ll studies o f this type, will  randomize the primary care 
practices t o a t ime p oint to receive the intervention, but analyze outcomes a t the individual le vel. Our proposed 
randomization approach is ethical, given un certainty regarding the relative timeliness and patient- centeredness of direct 
and ED a dmissions f or children.50 However, r andomization at t he level of the individual i s impractical, as consent an d 
randomization w ould n eed t o occur by h undreds o f PCPs in their office settings – a feat t hat would b e extraordina rily 
difficult to a ccomplish. Beyond t his, w e have se lected th e SW D for se veral  reasons. First, t his study design h as an 
advantage over c onventional  cluster r andomize d trials in that it allows stepwise rollout of the direct admission 
interventio n to practices, requiring fewer resources than would be needed to offer the interventio n to all clusters 
simulta neously. Relatedly, the SWD will allow the PHM services accepting direct admissions to start with a relatively low 
number o f direct a dmissions,  and to ma ke necessary organizational  and infrastructur e changes i f needed t o support o ur 
direct a dmission ev aluation d uring a l ower -volume time period. This study d esign h as an analytic a dvantage as w ell, 
allowing us to ma ke comparisons w ithin gr oups o ver t ime,  as well as between groups a t the s ame time p eriod.  Finally, 
because of the perceived benefits of direct admission and to optimize the enrollment of PCP practices, t his design i s 
advantageous to maintain control  practice engagement i n the study.50–[ADDRESS_835142], because the 
design involves unidirectional crossover from the control (ED) to the intervention arm,  our models will  include an 
indicator specific to the practice and ti me point. Second, our analyses will take into account the hierarchical structures of 
the data. Each patient contributes a single observation of each outcome; hence, the data are cross-s ectionally structured 
at the patient l evel and longitudinally structured at the clinic level with patients and clinics nested within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Third, 
our analyses will carefully evaluate secular time trends, to separate the effect of the intervention from the effect of time. 
Fourth, to identify the populations that experience the greatest benefits from direct admission, we will test several  a 
priori  hypotheses.
Data Adequacy & Management . With the exception of o ur parent -reported outcome, all require d data for this project

PCORI Cycle [ADDRESS_835144] PFA:  Research Plan Template                                                                        
 [ADDRESS_835145] admission intervention  will be associated with more rapid initiation of clinical care and 
improved family experience of care with no significant differences in rates of clinical deterioration (as measured by [CONTACT_626693]) . We test two variants of this hypothesis: (i) a patient -level version 
and (ii) a clinic -level version. The patient -level version is direct  in that it evaluates the aim and tests the hypothesis as 
stated. The clinic -level version is indirect in that it tests whether the intervention has a n overall effect across all patients , 
whether or not they were directly admitted.  
We will first determine crude differences in baseline clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, and in our primary 
and secondary outcomes , between children admitted directly and through EDs, using  t-tests and chi -square tests as 
appropriate. However, because these unadjusted anal yses do not adjust for observed predictors related to direct and ED 
admission , including temporal trends, for our main analys es we will use regression models. Because all patients receive 
some form of clinical care at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626625], there is no censoring associated with the 
measurement of time to clinical care. Therefore, standard regression models may be used. Patient characteristics 
incorporated in models will include diagnosis, medical complexity,49 level of care (observation versus inpatient), as well 
as age, gender, race/ethnicity and payer. The statistical model for our direct patient -level comparison of direct 
admission (DA) versus ED admission patients  (analysis i) is   
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽3𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽4ℎ+𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖ℎ+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 
in which 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 is the outcome variable for patient i  seen by  [CONTACT_6903]  j at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] h  at time t; 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 is a binary variable 
indicating whether the patient was admitted via direct admission ( 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=1 ) or the ER ( 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=0 ), 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 is a vector 
of patient -level controls  and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖ℎ is a random effect for clinic  within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In addition, the model includes fixed-effects 
for time -period, 𝛽𝛽3𝑡𝑡, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 𝛽𝛽4ℎ, to capture the general unstructured trend across calendar time and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -
specific effects, respectively. The key coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽1, which captures the association of  a patient being 
admitted directly versus by [CONTACT_626694] . A crucial feature of this analysis is that the predictor of primary 
interest, DA, varies within clinic and time -period mitigating almost all forms of clustering. Therefore, although the data 
are clustered by [CONTACT_626695], the primary source of information about the association of DA with the outcome is from 
contrasts within clinic and time -period. Hence, accounting for time -period and clinic  effects  is likely to strengthen the 
statistical significance of our results . 
When estimating the model in (i), for our primary analysis we plan to only use observations from the post -period. This 
avoid s any contamination from outcomes of  ED observations when DA was not available. However, to gain some insight 
into the closeness of the results from this analysis with those that we’d expect to see if it was possible to have patient -
level randomization, in a supplemental analysis we will include the pre-intervention ED observations and test if there is a 
change in the mean  ED outcome in the post -intervention period. A result consistent with minimal change over time will 
support a finding that,  in the absence of the intervention,  the outcomes for DA patients would have been the same as 
those observed for ED patients . 
The statistical model for analysis (ii)  has a similar form : 
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽3𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽4ℎ+𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖ℎ+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 
differing only in that the direct admission indicator is replaced with 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡, a time -varying practice within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626626]-out  (1 = intervention transition has occurred by [CONTACT_552749] t and 
0 = direct admission intervention has not occurred by [CONTACT_5586]-period t). The key coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽1, which captures 
the structural shift in the outcome that occurs when a practice receives the direct admission intervention. Because 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 does not vary  within  a clinic and  time -period, the information in the observations made within a clinic and time -
period depends on the size of the effects of clinic and time-period  with the statistical significance of inferences about 𝛽𝛽1 
is likely to be reduced by [CONTACT_626696] . An additional component of clustering arises because 
the four groups are aligned with  nine practice groups that in turn are embedded in three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. We acknowledge 
that there may be separate level s of clustering in the data  due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626627].

sensitivity analysis excluding these two practices. This will allow us to determine the extent to which our findings are associated with the addition of these two practices.  A substantial difference in results would be suggestive of 
heterogeneous effects of the intervention acros s the sites and our conclusions would discuss  such a finding. The 
prolongation of Steps 3 and 4 from 6 months to 9 months, and the addition of a 9 -month maintenance block (months 
37-45),  will be naturally addressed with our statistical model due to observations being at the level of the individual. 
Each observation will be coded according to the time-period the study is in at the time of the observation. The width of the intervals will not have an effect on the results of the analysis. If we have concerns a bout trends within an interval, 
we will add an additional covariate (including in the vector 𝑥𝑥
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡)  that reflects the precise date when the observation is 
made.  These analytic additions will apply to both Aim [ADDRESS_835148] admission relative to children admitted with other clinical diagnoses,  we 
will evaluate group -level heterogeneity of treatment effects (HT E) by [CONTACT_626697] a priori. Although there is no prior literature about 
the relative benefits of direct admission for these subgroups, this hypothesis is derived from our deliberative discussions with multidisciplinary stakeholders, based on their lived experiences. Our anticipated sample size for subgroups is derived from national statistics about pediatric inpatient stays 
(HUCPnet.ahrq.gov) , shown in Table 3 . Although our assessment of  HTE will follow 
methodological guidance that all subgroups be specified a priori, we will consider 
other subgroup analyses based on recommendations from P arent P artners and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ DALTs .
55,56 Subgroup analyses will  be performed by [CONTACT_626698] (i) given 
above  for the subgroups of interest. To evaluate whether the effect of the direction admission intervention varies 
significantly across subgroups, we will augment the model  specified in Aim 1  analysis (i)  with a predictor for the product 
of the subgroup -defining variable and DA; the coefficient of the additional variable is referred to as an interaction effect 
and its value captures the extent to which the effect of DA  differs bet ween one level of the subgroup to the other. This 
approach is based on the recommendations by [CONTACT_626699]., who recommend analysis and reporting of multivariate  risk-
based HTE to account for the fact that patients have multiple characteristics simultaneously that affect the l ikelihood of 
benefiting from an  intervention.56,[ADDRESS_835149]

definitions, and our proposed approach are 
summarized in Table 4 . This approach 
combines analysis of our primary and 
secondary outcomes  with analysis of process 
measures and qualitative interviews with 
stakeholders . Semi-structured interviews  
focused on Adoption, Implementation, and 
Maintenance domains ( Table 4) will be 
conducted with parents of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496371], referring PCPs, and inpatient 
healthcare team members including nurses, 
resident phys icians, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266], and other key 
stakeholders. We anticipate completing 12 -16 
in-depth interviews with stakeholders each 
calendar year, for a total of 36 -48 interviews 
per site over the 4-year implementation 
period. However, interviews will be continued 
until thematic saturation is reached.58 Interviews will be recorded with permission and transcribed verbatim, and 
analyzed iteratively (concurrent with ongoing qualitative work)  using a general inductive approach.59–[ADDRESS_835152] s. Leyenaar  and McDaniel , in partnership with [CONTACT_626715] (Co -investigator , Years 1 -3), [CONTACT_626716] -Files (Years 3 -

participants, and with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ DALTs, both to  return results to participants  and to  member -check the credibility of 
findings.62,63  
6. Study Population and Setting  
Eligibility Criteria. We will limit our analysis to children < 18 years of age admitted with the following common medical 
reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: gastroenteritis/dehydration, skin and soft tissue infection, UTI, pneumonia,  viral infection 
not otherwise specified, and influenza . These diagnoses comprise approximately 25% of all u nscheduled PHM 
admissions nationally, and represent conditions that have been identified as appropriate for direct admission but not 
currently accepted for direct admission at the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99622].25,39 Children with planned admissions (i.e. 
chemotherapy ), those admitted to non -PHM Services (i.e. the ICU), and those transferred from other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626628].  
Selection of Study Sites . To achieve our overall goal of implementing and evaluating a  standardized direct admission 
intervention, we aimed to select hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626629]: (i) low baseline direct admission rates, 
allowing us to implement a standardized direct admission system; (ii) institutional support to increase direct admission rates using a standardized direct admission system; and (iii) interest from and capacity among pediatric primary care 
practices to refer children for direct admission when indicated. Beyond this, to optimize the external validity  of ou r 
study findings, we aimed to work with geographically and structurally diverse hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], including both general (non -
children’s) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626630]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Relatedly, we sought project partners that had differing relationships/levels of integration between PHM services and PCP practices (i.e. primary care practice ownership versus independence). To solicit interest from a diverse prospective sample of partner sites, we received the support of the Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings (PRIS), a  research network with more than 100 participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207714].

Structure of Study Sites : CHP  has a Pediatric ED with an annual volume of  over 80,000 visits and a PHM Service that 
provides care to  > 9000 children each year. At  CHP, the ambulatory care partners will be  Pediatric Alliance ( 11 practices) , 
Kids Plus Pediatric s (3 practices) , Children’s Community Pediatrics ( 18 practices including 14  primary care and 4 urgent 
care ), and General Academic Pediatrics  (2 practices) . These practices are affiliated with  CHP as part of a regional 
Pediatric Clinical Integrated Network. Excluding General Academic Pediatrics , these practice groups  are independently 
owned and operated. NCH  has a Pediatric ED annual volume of  >90,[ADDRESS_835155]. Ryan Bode, Site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_626631] ; he is fully supportive of randomizing their [ADDRESS_835156]. Finally, PRMC-E  
is a general hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626632], W ashington, where PHM services are provided by [CONTACT_626700]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  At this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], children seeking care in their ED are cared for in a general (non-children’s) ED by 
[CONTACT_626701] (non -pediatric) emergency medicine physicians.  PRMC-E  admits approximately 650 children annually. The 
ambulatory care partners at this site include the t hree primary care groups that together account for two -thirds of 
PRMC-E’s referrals : The Everett Clinic (TEC),  comprised of 10 pediatric primary care practices; the Providence Medical 
Group (PMG), comprised of 6 pediatric primary care practices; and Community Health Clinics of Snohomish County 
(CHC), comprised of 2 pediatric primary care practices.    
7. Recruitment Plan for Prospective Studies . Each of our three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626633] 
2017 calendar year to identify the number of children admitted to their PHM services , with an eligible diagnosis , from 
our partnering pediatric primary care practices. The resulting projected sample size is shown in Table 5 , with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -
specific estimates provided in Appendix  B.  Given the availability of historic data from all of our partner sites, we are 
confident in  our sample size estimate . Because our primary outcome will be derived from EHR data, which is available 
for all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626634], we anticipate no missing data for this timeliness outcome. This is also true of our secondary outcomes derived from EHR data, includin g ICU transfer and rapid response 
calls. However, for our parent -reported measure of family experience of care, we estimate a response rate of 75%, 
accounting for potential parental refusals, absence of parents from the bedside, and inability to complete the survey in 
English , Spanish , Somali, Nepali or Arabic. (This 
response rate aligns with past work requesting parental participation in a survey during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]
64,65). To collect this parent -reported 
outcome, we will approach parents/guardians 
during their child’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], either by [CONTACT_14379]-person, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_626635]’s COVID -19 
regulations. A research assistant will explain the 
study, and administer the survey via tablet or via 
personal cellphone to those parents/guardians 
who provide informed consent.  Our sample size estimate for the relative number of direct admissions is de pendent upon three 
assumptions/ components of the direct admission 
process – first, that approximately 13% of 
children who are admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626636] (an Table 5 .  Estimated Sample Size, Attrition, and Monthly Enrollment

 13 estimate derived from administrative data at NCH ); second that these PCPs will contact [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_626637] 
(a component of our direct admission  intervention education);  and third, that the PHM service will deem the child 
appropriate for direct admission and have a bed available . For this third criteria, we conservatively estimate that 80% of 
children referred for direct admission from PCPs will be accepted. Based on these assumptions, we estimate that 10% of 
children cared for by [CONTACT_626702]  (Figure 2).  Please note that our estimate that 
13% of children who are admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626638]; our PCP stakeholder partners 
have estimated that between 15 and 50% of their admitted patients are seen in their clinics prior to admission. For children considered for direct admission from urgent care centers, we anticipate that eligible urgent care providers will 
call to request direct admission in 80% of cases, and that 80% of th ese patients will be accepted. Our projected sample 
size of children admitted through the ED takes into account our assumption that these children may be more acutely unwell and/or clinically unstable. Correspondingly, we estimate that 70% of children who are admitted through  the ED 
at children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626639], and that 95% of those who are admitted through the ED at our community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626640] (given lower levels of acuity of c hildren admitted 
to community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626641]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) . 
8. Sample Size and Power . Our projected sample s ize is shown in T able [ADDRESS_835160] time -period s. Therefore , for analysis (i) there 
will be [ADDRESS_835161] of all forms of clustering in 
analysis (i) of Aim [ADDRESS_835162] size determination, the PHM program at Lowell General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Lowell, MA), which has a well-established direct admission program, collected timeliness data from April- July 2018, applying the same eligibility 
criteria and definition proposed for this study. ED timeliness data was similarly derived from Lowell and PMRC -E. We 
found that mean time to clinical care for ED admissions was 85 min [SD 83 min], and mean time for direct admissions 
was 40 minutes [SD 28 min].  
With the  above  means and standard deviations, a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_835163] deviations 
performed in the context of analysis (i) of Aim 1 has power well in excess of 0.99. There is also substantial power for sub -
group analyses. For example, the power of a subgroup analysis that involves 10% of the sample ( applied evenly across 
clinics and time -intervals) has power of 0.98. It is only when the subgroup is as small as 5% that power falls below 0.80. 
These power  calculation s can be performed using self -calculation or a variety of software packages. In this instance, it 
was performed using Satterwaite’s approximation (i.e., evaluating a pooled variance to approximate the sampling 
distribution of the actual test -statistic by a t- distribution)  under nQuery . 
For analysis (ii) we only compute power for the effect of Post , the effect of a clinic receiving the intervention and 
entering the post period, for the analysis of the entire sample. The method of computing the power for this stepped -
wedge design (SWD) with unequal standard deviations in the prior and post time-periods  is to first determine the 
design -effect for the SWD and then compute the power for a t wo-population comparison using the effective-sample-
sizes based on the design- effect. The design-effect  is estimated  using the expression  in Woertman et al (2013) , also 
described in Hemming (2016) . Because hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626642] -classified across the four SWD  groups, and 
because little is known about likely levels of interclass correlation coefficients (i.e., the level of clustering) for each of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], practice -group and clinic, we perform illustrative power calculations assuming that the net impact of clustering 
is equivalent to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-level clustering alone with an ICC of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316719] 0.05. Based on results for past c luster -
randomized studies at the clinic level, an intraclass correlation of 0.05 appears to be a conservative estimate of clustering by [CONTACT_6903]
66,67 and so it is not unreasonable for 0.05 to still be conservative once the upper -level sources of 
cross -classified clustering are absorbed. The other inputs are 70 practices (clusters), [ADDRESS_835164] is 2.385. Therefore, the effective sample -size  (ESS)  is 711.

 [ADDRESS_835166] deviation of the outcome in the pre-period is given by [CONTACT_626703]; the mean is [ADDRESS_835167], using the total theorem of 
probability  to compute marginal effects . The weight of DA to total patients is 19/106 = 0.094. The weighted average 
marginal mean and weighted average marginal standard deviation  of the observations in the post period are 76.93 and  
84.99, respectively . Because the sample- sizes are reasonably large, an asymptotic normal approximation is well justified 
(i.e., the true distribution of the outcome is bimodal will be averaged out). Given the ESS’s and these means and 
standard deviations, a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_835168] for DA patients.  
9. Outcomes . Our primary outcome , prioritized by [CONTACT_626704] ,
39 will be timeli ness of clinical care provision. Timeliness of clinical care  will be defined as the 
time from arrival at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626643] ( including diagnostic 
testing and/or medical management). This outcome will be derived from EHR time stamps; all project sites use EHRs to document times of patient registration, orders, administration of medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and diagnostic tests. EHR 
time stamps have been previously validated using time motion data;
68 during the pre-implementation period we will 
similarly validate the accuracy of time stamps by [CONTACT_626705][INVESTIGATOR_307].69 The feasibility of 
collecting timeliness outcome data is supported by [CONTACT_626706][INVESTIGATOR_626644] -E, as 
described above (see Power Calculation, effect size estimation ).  
Secondary outcomes  will include: (i)  parent-reported family expe rience of care (detailed below); (ii) unanticipated 
transfer to the ICU within 6 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], a marker of clinical deterioration;38 and (iii)  rapid response calls 
within 6 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], a second marker of clinical deterioration defined as  calls to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s medical-
emergency team placed by [CONTACT_626707]. Outcomes (ii) and (iii) will be extracted from the EHR; these are 
tracked routinely by [CONTACT_626708] .
70,71  Family experience of 
care  will be determined by  [CONTACT_84452]/ parent-report  using questions derived from 
the Child Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626645] (Child HCAHPS) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626646]72 and the 
Consumer Quality Index Inpatient Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626647] .73 The Child 
HCAHPS is a validated and publicl y available parent -reported measure of pediatric 
inpat ient family experience of care, available in English and Spanish . It contains 
several modules and composite measures; to evaluate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626648], which focuses on 
communication and medication reconciliation during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], as 
well as the global hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626649]. We will augment the Child HCAHPS with 
questions derived from the validated Consumer Quality Index Inpatient Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626647]  (Table 6 ).
73 
These parent -reported measures will be reported on a 0 -100 scale, with high scores indicating better experiences of 
care. Six to seventy -two  hours following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (and prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]), parents will be approached 
by a research team member , in person or via phone,  to explain the study and request completion of the survey via tablet  
or via their personal electronic devices. This time period was selected to allow sufficient time to have passed to allow parents to reflect on their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], yet to minimize bias in their responses due to post -admission experiences. 
In our past studies we have had response rates of >75% using this approach.

practices (with all diagnoses during the study period) to complete the family experience of care survey.  
 10. Engagement Plan  
Planning the Study : Broadly speaking, k ey stakeholders in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626653]: (i) children and their 
families, (ii) referring healthcare providers, (iii) healthcare teams that provide hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based care (including ED 
physicians, pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266], resident physicians, and nurses), (iv) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367596], (v) practice managers, (vi) payers , and (vii) policymakers (including professional societies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics).  
Stakeholders from these groups have played an  integral role in prioritizing  components of our proposed intervention, 
and in selecting the outcomes they deemed most relevant to evaluating this intervention. In our  formative work , 
multidisciplinary stakeholders engaged in interviews, deliberative discussions  and a Delphi process  to identify the 
populations and syst ems appropriate for pediatric direct admission , and to prioritize outcomes to evaluate ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_626654].
29,39 This preliminary work has directly informed our proposed intervention and outcomes.   
Conducting the Study : Members of the multistakeholder panel  that developed the direct admission guidelines in our 
formative work  will scaffold the proposed project  as members of our DAAP , providing feedback on quarterly  conference 
calls to guide project planning,  implementation and analysis ( Please see their LOS). Because this is a clinical int ervention 
being implemented in real- world settings, implementation at each site will be lead by a PHM Clinical Leader  (Co-
investigator) . All of our Clinical Leaders are full time pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626655], actively 
engage with multidisciplinary stakeholders daily, and understand  the clinical context . His/her roles will be supported by 
[CONTACT_3725]-specific DALT s comprised of parents, PCPs , and healthcare providers who will participate in monthly implementation 
meetings to make key decisions about how to adapt the intervention to the local context, data collection considerations 
to maximize participation while minimizing disruptions to clinical operations, adherence to the intervention, and 
designing and revising  monthly data reports and qualitative analys is summaries . As described above, [CONTACT_626718],  
Parent Partner, will work with the research team to identify key concepts and themes  in interview transcripts .  
Disseminating the Study Results :  We aim to disseminate our results broadly, providing results that are both meaningful 
and timely . The site -specific DALTs  will, in their monthly  meetings, design and revise monthly data reports and 
qualitative analysis summaries to ensure that data presentation is useful and meaningful. Paige Stein, TDI Director of Communications has also agreed to support these dissemination efforts via social media, infographics and press 
releases. Members of the DAAP  have agreed to disseminate results through their professional networks  (see their LOS ). 
To reach pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266], we  will disseminate findings via a PRIS network webinar . Beyond these strategies, the 
DAAP  and DALTs  will brainstorm additional means of disseminating results to key stakeholders beyond traditional 
methods.  
11. Timeline. The timeline for rollout of our direct admission intervention is summarized in Figure 2.  During the first six-
month period, we will pursue IRB  approvals and all sites will conduct a time -motion study to validate EHR time stamps  
and EHR data extraction protocols . In addition, all sites will convene their multi- disciplinary DALTs to adapt the direct 
admission intervention and educational materials a s needed to their local context, and Clinical Leaders will conduct site  
visits with PCP practices randomized to the first group. The implementation period will span 45 months, with the final 6   
months of the funding period dedicated to analyses and results dissemination.

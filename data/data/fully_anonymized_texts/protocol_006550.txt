1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title: Increasing African Immigrants’ Breast Cancer Screening
Grant Number: R21MN012863
Study Description: The barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening for other minority groups 
from underserved populations, such as African Americans and Latina women 
have been studied. Less is known about these for African immigrant women and 
how to most effectively engage their participation in regular screening. The long 
term goal of the proposed project is to conduct a clinical trial that tests the 
feasibility of an adapted intervention to increase breast cancer screening rates 
for African-born immigrants. The study team plans to pursue the following 
specific aims: (1) Identify barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening 
among African-born immigrants and (2) Culturally adapt and pi[INVESTIGATOR_62278]-born women. 
Objectives*:Primary Objective: Adapt and pi[INVESTIGATOR_62279]. Secondary Objectives: Identify barriers and facilitators of breast cancer 
screening 
Endpoints*:Primary Endpoint: change from baseline assessment of mammogram screening 
intention and mammogram location and appointment.
Secondary Endpoints: change from baseline assessment of perceived breast 
cancer risk and self-efficacy for mammography.

2.1 STUDY RATIONALE 
[LOCATION_001] City (NYC) is home to a large and diverse immigrant population. Specifically, African immigration 
has increased over 750% in the past 20 years with a high concentration living in NYC.1,2 African immigrants 
are a very heterogeneous population with no individual country accounting for more than 14% of the 
total; most are likely to live below the poverty line, less likely to have health insurance, more likely to have 
low health literacy, and less likely to visit a doctor particularly for primary/preventive care.3,4,[ADDRESS_67049] important factors of increased survival. 
Health disparities plague the health care system and arise from a complex interplay of economic, social 
and cultural factors. The Health Belief Model (HBM) provides a framework for addressing cultural health 
disparities related to preventive health care and cancer screening by [CONTACT_62310] a decision to 
engage in a health behavior (e.g., cancer screening) is determined by [CONTACT_62311] 
(susceptibility, barriers) versus benefits.11 Traditionally, health information has been presented in didactic 
forms (i.e., statistical evidence/facts) to educate, persuade, and engage target communities.12,13 Narrative 
communication (i.e., storytelling, personal testimonials) has emerged as a method for supporting and 
motivating behavioral change including personal experiences with cancer or screening. The appeal and 
success of narrative communication stem from its familiarity as a basic mode of human interaction.14,[ADDRESS_67050] and cervical cancer screenings has 
targeted African Americans and Latinas 20,4,21,22,23; but few have targeted African-born populations. 
Second, a community-based recruitment strategy for the cancer screening education intervention is 
proposed. Adopting this approach will allow us to reach African-born immigrant women at places they 
frequent and provide new information about the barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screenings, 
particularly among those who are currently unable to access health care. Third, to our knowledge, this is 
the first study to obtain the perspectives of African-born community leaders about how African immigrant 
women’s participation in breast cancer screening can be improved. Fourth, this project will represent the 
first approach to pi[INVESTIGATOR_62280] a narrative approach in educating African-
born immigrants about breast cancer screening. While education programs can improve cancer and

plan to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening 
among African-born immigrants and (2) Culturally adapt and pi[INVESTIGATOR_62281]-born women. Thus, we will culturally adapt an effective, innovative 
intervention to address this significant health disparity in African-born immigrant communities. Once we 
have pi[INVESTIGATOR_62282], we will apply for R01 funding.
2.2 BACKGROUND 
Minimal research has been conducted specifically on the needs of African immigrant groups. Though 
African immigrants and African Americans/blacks share a common ancestral history, they are distinct 
cultural groups with differing values, perceptions, experiences and languages.8 Available research studies 
often erroneously classify each culture as one homogenous group (i.e., African American/Black), which 
limits our understanding of the specific needs of African immigrants. Most research on the cancer control 
needs of African immigrants has focused on individuals from Nigeria, Somalia and Ghana9, furthering 
limiting our understanding of individuals who are not from these countries. Immigrants from Africa come 
from many different countries that have distinct languages.[ADDRESS_67052] cancer screening data in this population of African-born immigrants, when corrected for age, 
shows that only 56% have ever had a mammography for breast cancer screening. This finding 
demonstrates the need for breast cancer screening awareness and education within this population. We 
have conducted robust culturally targeted outreach into several minority communities. The Witness 
Project (WP) is a community-based cervical and breast cancer education program that is designed to meet 
educational and cultural levels of underserved African American women. The WP model is a belief and 
theory-based intervention incorporating the Health Belief Model, locus of control beliefs, social learning 
theory, transtheoretical model of change and the 4MAT System.[ADDRESS_67053] self-examination and a question 
and answer session concludes the program. Research by [CONTACT_62312] (Co-I) and Erwin successfully replicated 
the Witness Project in [ADDRESS_67054] winning video (now on CancerControl PLANET RTIPs) and 
training curriculum developed by [CONTACT_62313] (National Cancer Institute Cancer Control Planet). In 
NYC, we conducted hundreds of programs at a variety of community sites and have educated over 3,000

community and over 15 years of community-based research experience.  
Development of  Esperanza y Vida: A unique aspect of the Witness Project is the ability to adapt the 
program to another culture as evidenced by [CONTACT_62314] y Vida (EyV). In 2003, Jandorf and colleagues 
initiated EyV to expand this breast educational program among Hispanic populations in a culturally and 
linguistically congruent, community-based approach.4,12 EyV development was conducted with members 
of the target group, including qualitative studies, to ensure the adaptation would be culturally appropriate 
and meaningful.46,47 The social network characteristics and language preferences (Spanish) assessed and 
integrated into the intervention to include such factors of where to present the programs (e.g. both 
community and faith-based locations) and the need to educate men about issues related to women’s

programs through vigorous qualitative methods and pi[INVESTIGATOR_62283].

Protocol STUDY-19-[ZIP_CODE] 17 March 2023
Based on “NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research” 12The “point of interface” (i.e., merging quantitative and qualitative data) will be associations between 
mammography screening and HBM constructs (e.g., perceived risk, self-efficacy) and any socio-
demographic characteristics (i.e., preferred language, health literacy level). The quantitative results will 
inform the refinement of the qualitative questions. For example, if an association is found between self-
efficacy and screening, we will ask in-depth questions about self-efficacy and suggestions for how it could 
be improved in this population.
The design chosen for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test is a one-group pretest –posttest. All of the enrolled participants will 
receive the same intervention in their preferred language (English or French). To measure the impact of 
the intervention, will conduct a pre-post assessment of key variables around perceived risk for breast 
cancer, the intention to complete a mammogram, and self-efficacy related to seeking and completing 
breast cancer screening. This trial will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN
Aim 1.  Although there are multiple social/environmental determinants of cancer screening, screening 
involves an individual deciding whether to engage in the screening behavior or not.26,27 The HBM asserts 
that an individual’s attitudes and beliefs (e.g., perceived benefits, perceived barriers) will determine their 
behavioral intentions.[ADDRESS_67059] existing health decision-making models assume that decisions about a behavior 
are a function of an individual’s perceptions of the expected utility (benefit-cost ratio) of the behavior and 
of other cognitive factors (e.g., self-efficacy, perceived risk).28,29,[ADDRESS_67060] of presenting information because people communicate with each other and learn 
in everyday life primarily through stories.14 By [CONTACT_40397] a feeling of similarity to and identification with the 
communicator, narrative communication can increase an individual’s perceived risk regarding a particular 
health related behavior.54 People with personal experiences make credible, believable messengers.

Increasing African Immigrants’ Breast Cancer Screening Version 1.3 
Protocol STUDY-19-[ZIP_CODE] 17 March 2023
Based on “NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research” 13Additionally, narratives can be particularly useful for conveying cancer information because they reduce 
counterarguments which can help individuals overcome barriers to seeking treatment.15 Narratives also 
diminish negative feelings towards unknown, difficult, or frightening procedures (e.g., screening), provide 
role models for behavior change and create new attitudes that are based on cognition and emotion.[ADDRESS_67061] capabilities of narrative health communication are: “overcoming resistance, facilitating 
information processing, providing surrogate social connections, and representing emotional and 
existential issues.”[ADDRESS_67062] examined the influence of these programs on barriers and facilitators on 
health care engagement among African-born immigrants. It is anticipated that, like with other cancer 
screenings, African-born immigrants’ eligible for screenings face unique barriers to these procedures that 
can be successfully targeted in community-based group narrative education cancer screening 
interventions. One study showed that narrative communications about certain cancers (e.g., breast 
cancer) reduced message counterarguments, increased positive affect, fostered identification with the 
communicator and led to better engagement with the message. These outcomes thereby [CONTACT_62318], increased message recall and promoted discussion with family members.[ADDRESS_67063] described the scientific premise and discussed the strengths of weaknesses of both the published 
research and our preliminary data. This careful consideration of the prior research and our preliminary 
data has been critical in: 1) identifying the gaps apparent in research and public health practice with 
respect to the unknown barriers and facilitators that African immigrant women face when attempting to 
undergo breast cancer screening; and 2) adaptation of the narrative group-based cancer screening 
education program that we propose to pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087]. We will identify cultural barriers and facilitators to 
engagement in breast cancer screening and develop a culturally targeted breast cancer education 
program for African immigrant women. The community-based education program will be the first its kind 
to specifically target barriers and reinforce facilitators to breast cancer screening faced by [CONTACT_62319]-born

5.4 SCREEN FAILURES
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of failing to 
meeting one or more inclusion criteria that are likely to change over time may be rescreened (e.g. age). 
Rescreened participants will be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening.
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
As indicated in the proposal, human subjects will be recruited for in-depth interviews (N=30) and surveys 
(N=50), in Aim 1 to understand preferred language, cultural beliefs, access to health care; healthcare 
engagement, knowledge of breast cancer screening guidelines and predictors of screening behavior. 
Recruitment will take place within African immigrant communities in [LOCATION_001] City. 
After incorporating the Aim [ADDRESS_67066] cancer educational program, 64 (n = 32 for 
English and n = 32 for French speaking) eligible African-born women will be recruited to pi[INVESTIGATOR_62287]. Participants will be recruited from African immigrant communities in New 
York City.
Aim 1: Participants will be recruited from the community with the help of our community partner – African 
Services Committee. Our community partners will help us with our recruitment efforts by [CONTACT_62320]. 
Participants will be compensated $30 to a local store for participating in the research study. In addition, 
we will promote our study on social media (e.g. WhatsApp groups, Facebook pages) using  flyers and video 
advertisements adapted for online sharing.
Aim 2: Experienced outreach coordinators, assisted by [CONTACT_33748], will recruit local 
community, faith-based, and other social organizations to host breast cancer educational programs as we

programs will be held in English and some in French; we will recruit participants who speak either English 
and/or French. Participants will receive an incentive for their time ($[ADDRESS_67068] to a local store). 
The study team has significant experience recruiting participants and have well-trained culturally 
competent research staff. We have well-established collaborative relationships with gatekeepers in the 
African immigrant community and have successfully recruited African-born immigrants into other studies. 
Our prior recruitment has demonstrated response rates of 70%-90%.

cancer resource guides with local information about how and where to obtain screening. The program 
will take approximately 90 minutes to complete.  Participants will receive an incentive ($[ADDRESS_67070]) for 
their participation. Participants will complete a pre-program survey and a post-program survey to assess 
changes in HBM constructs. The post-program survey will also include a feasibility questionnaire. 62,63,64,[ADDRESS_67071] used 
in previous studies. The summary collects information about the length of the program, number of 
participants attending the program, gender of program participants, location and site of the program, 
number of staff and volunteers present, and type of site (faith-based or community-based).
For both in person and virtual educational programs, demographic and pre-post surveys will be primarily 
collected via RedCap. For virtual programs, participants will be provided with RedCap survey links via chat. 
For in person programs, participants will be able to complete surveys through RedCap on their own 
devices or on devices provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_62289]. All pre and post assessments, collected via RedCap or 
hard copy of surveys, will be linked only via participant study ID. Assessments will not collect any PHI. They 
will be anonymous as participant names will not be collected.
6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING
For Aim 1 of the study, interested individuals will be invited to perform the study activities in a single 
session, in which they will express informed consent, provide demographic data and complete an in-depth 
interview or an interviewer-administered survey. Once consented, participants may also complete the 
demographic questionnaire and/or the interview or survey on another time and/or day of their choice, if 
so they prefer (i.e., because they feel fatigued; if they have limited continuous availability of time).
For Aim [ADDRESS_67072] a total of eight programs in English (N=4) and French (N=4). We will 
recruit a total of 64 eligible women at each program. When recruiting program sites, the Research 
Assistant will emphasize the language in which the program will be conducted.
The administration of the intervention – including frequency, schedule, setting, and required personnel – 
will be determined using the input of individuals taking part in Aim [ADDRESS_67073] TRAINING AND TRACKING

myths, barriers and values, 2) culturally relevant breast cancer narrative, 3) experiential breast education. 
Themes will be categorized in the following domains: cultural empowerment and relationships and 
expectations. These themes will inform how the intervention components for the educational narrative 
program should be adapted for an African immigrant audience. The themes will first be categorized 
according to barriers and facilitators to screening and then our team will decide which themes are 
appropriate. For example, barriers and facilitators from the cultural empowerment domain may include 
concerns about deportation, modesty, religiosity and healthcare screenings and will be addressed in the 
Witness Project component 1. Another example might be that barriers and facilitators from the Measure Source Study Aim Number of Items Reliability

incorporated into the program by [CONTACT_62322]. Cultural 
barriers identified will also be addressed in the culturally relevant narrative by [CONTACT_62323][INVESTIGATOR_62290].
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
Monitoring the progress of trials and the safety of participants. The proposed research is a low-risk 
behavioral trial. Research staff will carefully monitor each participant’s emotional reaction during 
interviews and offer a referral when appropriate. As per ISMMS IRB policies, the PIs are required to notify 
the IRB promptly of any unanticipated problems involving risks to study participants or others that occur. 
The PIs and study investigators will monitor the progress of the trial and safety of participants on an 
ongoing basis. The procedures of this study, such as regular meetings with research staff, will ensure 
discussion and reporting of all possible outcomes including adverse events. If the adverse event is due to 
the study and is unexpected, the PIs will draft a safety report and send a copy to the ISMMS IRBs. The IRB 
committees will serve as an objective review mechanism. This policy/procedure means that any potential 
conflict of interest inherent in the PIs being the sole reviewers of serious adverse advents is avoided. The 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meets at least quarterly to review the results of adverse event 
reporting, protocol deviations, protocol audits and the conduct of the study. Each ISMMS study not 
otherwise overseen by [CONTACT_62324]. The DSMB reports the analysis of 
their review to Sr. Vice President for Research and to the IRB. To avoid conflicts of interest, members of 
the DSMB are not involved in the oversight of studies for which they serve as Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-
Investigator/ biostatistician.
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Plans for assuring adherence with requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events (AEs) All serious 
adverse events (AEs) (e.g., medical occurrences resulting in death) that occur during the study defined by 
[CONTACT_62325], regardless of the relation to the research, must be reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_756], 
e-mail or fax within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the occurrence of the event. The PIs will 
report AEs to the ISMMS IRB and will disseminate information to other agencies as necessary. These initial 
reports are followed by a safety report which is a written account of a serious AE determined by a 
sponsor/investigator to be both related to the treatment under investigation and unexpected in nature. 
Serious AEs will be summarized annually in the IRB application for continuation or termination of research. 
All expected non-serious AEs that occur at a greater frequency or severity than anticipated and all 
unexpected non-serious AEs will be reported to the IRB within 15 working days of the Investigators 
becoming aware of the event. These AEs are also summarized annually in the IRB application for 
continuation or termination of the research. Plans for assuring that any action resulting in a temporary or 
permanent suspension of an NCI funded clinical trial is reported to the NCI grant program director 
responsible for the grant. Jessica Moise, Director, Grants and Contracts Office at ISMMS, will provide

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_9155] (OHRP). OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being 
studied;
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include 
the following information:
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:  
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study 
sponsor/funding agency within <insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the investigator 
becoming aware of the event

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES
Descriptive statistics will provide summary information about the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability 
and cultural sensitivity of the program and satisfaction with the program. An arbitrary cutoff value of 80% 
acceptance will determine the interventions’ feasibility for the study. Some parameters include the 
proportion of eligible participants who are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], enrolled, agree, and disagree with the acceptability 
and cultural sensitivity of the program. Thus, if at least 80% of the participants exceed the previous 
parameters, the developed program will be determined to be feasible.
Primary Endpoints: 
We hypothesize that we will observe a change in the assessment of mammogram screening intention and 
knowledge of places where it is possible to obtain a mammogram appointment in the participants who 
will take part in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_62291] (posttest), compared to baseline 
(pretest).
Secondary Endpoints:
We hypothesize that we will observe a change in assessment of perceived breast cancer risk and self-
efficacy for mammography in the participants who will take part in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_62292] (posttest), compared to baseline (pretest).
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION

program efficacy and sample size estimates for a future intervention, we will use a repeated measures 
ANOVA to analyze differences in the primary outcomes: screening intentions and HBM constructs (e.g., 
self-efficacy and perceived risk) immediately before viewing the educational program and immediately 
after viewing the program. We will conduct univariate and bivariate analyses of the data to provide 
descriptive summaries of the data, including demographics and responses to primary outcome measures.
We expect only minor amounts of missing data from the surveys and feasibility questionnaires. However, 
we will examine any patterns of missing data and if needed, consider using missing data imputation 
methods.

Protocol STUDY-19-[ZIP_CODE] 17 March 2023
Based on “NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research” 249.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE ENDPOINT(S)
Quantitative Data Analysis: As the assessment will be administered as an interview, we do not anticipate 
much missing data. As needed, missing data will be imputed and then be used to estimate the parameter 
values for each of scales. We estimate that our sample size of 64 participants will generate a +/- 12% 
margin of error at a 95% confidence level. The primary outcomes are screening status (up-to-date with 
for mammography screening) and HBM constructs. As screening status is dichotomous, a logistic 
regression analysis will be conducted using socio-demographics and HBM constructs (e.g., self-efficacy, 
perceived risk, perceived benefits) as explanatory variables. Since Aim 1 is designed to provide 
information to inform the adaptation of the subsequent intervention and education, we shall adopt a less 
conservative criterion for statistical significance using a p -value equal to or less than 0.15. 
Qualitative Data Analysis. The PEN-3 model25 will guide the interpretation and analysis of the in-depth 
interviews. Using this model as a framework, the analysis approach will identify the unique barriers and 
facilitators related to African-born immigrants’ health care engagement. Transcripts will be reviewed 
using a  qualitative data management software. 50 Analysis will use a content analysis approach –  which 
includes  examining transcripts for salient categories of information supported by [CONTACT_62326] (e.g., barriers 
and facilitators to uptake of cancer screening in African immigrants). Themes that are extensively 
discussed by [CONTACT_62327]. Using a constant comparative approach, categories will be 
saturated until new information is no longer added. The research team will meet prior to conducting 
analysis to define coding labels and definitions. Potential labels and definitions will be drawn from 
identified barriers and facilitators for other preventive cancer screening exams (e.g., pap test, 
colonoscopy). All transcripts (including those translated from French to English) will be independently 
coded by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_62293]. They will 
meet multiple times to discuss the coding strategy for the first half of the interviews and discuss and 
resolve any coding discrepancies prior to coding of the remaining interviews, and again to resolve any 
remaining discrepancies by [CONTACT_21128]. When there is disagreement on coding labels, the research team 
will meet to discuss reasons for disagreement and modify coding labels appropriately. Analyses will also 
examine subgroup differences (i.e., country of origin), age, and language. Our proposed sample size of 30 
in-depth interview participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_62328]. If saturation is not achieved with the 30 participants, we will recruit more participants 
with collaborators and community partners.

Subgroup analyses are not warranted because the intervention is intended for a specific population – 
African immigrant women over the age of 38. Additionally, because of the small sample size, subgroup 
analyses will not be adequately powered to detect differences in endpoints.  A future, large-scale trial will 
have the ability examine sub-group differences.

[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS
For Aim 1, consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be 
given to the participant and written documentation of informed consent will be completed prior to 
starting the study intervention.  The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol:
In-depth interview consent form (English and French) 
Survey consent form (English and French) 
For Aim 2, we have requested a waiver of written consent due to the extremely low risk of this research 
as no PHI will be collected from participants. We are unable to consent participants prior to the program 
because we will not have their contact [CONTACT_3031] (as we are not collecting any PHI) – participants will 
be recruited and invited to the programs by [CONTACT_62329]. We anticipate having up to [ADDRESS_67080] experience, doing a full consent process with each individual participant is not feasible (for example, 
consenting procedures for Aim [ADDRESS_67081] taken up to 45 minutes for some participants). Since participants 
will be part of group sessions, the time and study personnel needed to individually consent each 
participant would become an undue burden for the participants. Each individual will be informed of study 
procedures and will give informed consent through reviewing a Research Information Sheet and verbally 
confirming their willingness to participate before engaging in the research. This also allows participants 
to become anonymous since we are not collecting their names or signatures, and privacy is a 
demonstrated concern for this population. Individuals will review, either via RedCap or hard copy, the

submitted with this protocol:
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_62294]: Research Information Sheet (English and French)
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION
Aim 1: Participants will be recruited from African immigrant communities in [LOCATION_001] City. We have a 
well-established collaborative relationship with gatekeepers in the African immigrant community and 
have successfully recruited African-born persons into prior studies and therefore anticipate successful 
recruitment for this proposed research. Participants will be recruited for in-depth interviews and surveys 
through IRB approved flyers at community sites and via social media platforms. Advertisements for 
recruitment will be in English and French and identical for both languages. A bilingual Research Assistant 
(English and French) will administer the in-depth interviews (n=30), which will take 60 minutes to 
complete and administer the surveys (N=50) which will take about 20 minutes to complete. 
Aims 2: Similar to recruitment for Aim 1, participant recruitment for Aim 2 will occur in African immigrant 
communities in [LOCATION_001] City. After refining the education programs using the findings from Aim 1, 64 
new participants (n=32 per language) will view the culturally-adapted education breast cancer screening 
program, after reviewing the Research Information Sheet and confirming their eligibility.  
On the day of the program, participants will review, either via RedCap or with a hard copy, the Research 
Information Sheet that will provide details about the research study. 
In person programs:
After participants arrive at the program, but before study procedures begin, study team members will 
distribute to each participant hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_62295]/or online versions via 
RedCap link that participants can access on their own or study team provided devices. Study team 
members will review the Research Information Sheet with each participant, privately and one on one, and 
answer any questions. Participants will also have the ability to read through the Research Information 
Sheet. Study team members will tell participants that participation is voluntary and will not impact their 
ability to seek medical care at Mount Sinai, discuss the expectations of participation (participating in an 
educational program, completing surveys, giving feedback on the educational program), discuss 
compensation ($[ADDRESS_67082]), communicate that no PHI will be collected (all information will be 
anonymous), and explain risks and benefits.

Version Date Description of Change Brief Rationale
1.1 02/12/2021 1) Recruitment for Aim 1 decreased 
from 94 to 80 participants;
2) Focus groups with community 
leaders replaced by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-depth 
interviews;
3) Recruitment strategy updated to 
include social media (e.g. WhatsApp 
and Facebook) as a new channel Conducting individual 
interviews (up to 10 individual 
interviews) instead of 3 focus 
groups will better help the study 
team adhere to social distancing 
guidelines amid the COVID-19 
pandemic. Using social media to 
recruit potential participants is 
expected to help us better 
dealing with the challenges to 
enroll individuals when the 
access to the community and 
community events is restricted. 
1.2 4/22/21 A mistake in the protocol title was 
corrected.A mistake in the protocol title 
was identified and corrected.
1.3 3/9/23 1) Aim 2 age eligibility changed to 
38 years of age or older.
2) Having had a mammogram in the 
previous 12 months was removed as 
an exclusion criteria for Aim 2.  1) Women should be given the 
option to start screening for 
breast cancer at the age of 40 
and our primary endpoint

Based on “NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research” 333) The length of the Aim 2 
intervention increased from 60 to 90 
minutes.
4) Aim 2 compensation increased to 
$60.
5) The measures for primary 
endpoints have been refined.
6) Mention of research information 
material for Aim 2 was included.
7) Approach to qualitative data 
analysis was updated.sound to include women under 
40. This is also based on the 
request a few participants have 
made about the inclusion of 
younger women in the 
educational program.
2) Our primary endpoint is 
intention to have a screening 
mammogram within [ADDRESS_67095] been screened 
recently.
3) We have also increased the 
length of the intervention from 
60 to 90 minutes to account for 
the assessments that participants 
will complete for research 
purposes.
4) Since the time of the 
intervention increased, the 
compensation amount has also 
increased in order to accurately 
reflect their time and effort.
5) Primary Endpoint: change 
from baseline assessment of 
mammogram screening 
intention and mammogram 
location and appointment.
Secondary Endpoints: change 
from baseline assessment of 
perceived breast cancer risk and 
self-efficacy for mammography.
6) Aim 2. We have requested a 
waiver of written consent due to 
the extremely low risk of this 
research as no PHI will be 
collected from participants. We 
are unable to consent 
participants prior to the program 
because we will not have their 
contact [CONTACT_3031] (as we are 
not collecting any PHI) – 
participants will be recruited 
and invited to the programs by 
[CONTACT_62329]. We 
anticipate having up to [ADDRESS_67096] limited staff 
available to consent 
participants. On the day of the

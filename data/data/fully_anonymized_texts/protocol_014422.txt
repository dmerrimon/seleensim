No text is to be entered in this section; rather it should be included under the relevant subheadings 
below.  It may be useful to complete this section after the relevant sections in the protocol have been 
completed.  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  CTR radon DaCCoTA  
Grant Number:  U54GM128729  
Study Description : The overall goal of this research is to compare the effectiveness 
of radon information delivered via the radon app vs. a traditional 
approach (printed brochure). The two methods will be compared 
on outcomes pertinent to the stages of individuals’ responses  to 
radon interventions.  
Objectives*: Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this research is to 
compare the effectiveness of radon information delivered via the 
radon app vs. a traditional approach (printed brochure)  on 
behavioral outcomes, i.e., the rate at which individuals order free 
radon test kits and the rate at which they return them to the lab . 
Secondary Objectives: The secondary objective of this research is 
to conduct a clinical trial to compare the effects of the radon app 
vs. brochures on increasing radon knowledge.  
Endpoint s*: Primary Endpoint:   
1. Number of radon test kits requested by [CONTACT_199783]; and  
2. Number of radon test kits used and returned to the laboratory 
by [CONTACT_199784].  
Secondary Endpoints:   
Effectiveness of the radon app vs. brochure at 3 months re: 
changes in radon knowledge, as measured by [CONTACT_199785] a series of 20 true/false questions (e.g., “The 
EPA recommends that homes with 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_199772] (pCi/L) 
or more of radon should be fixed.”).

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  4 Study Population:  Study participants are undergraduates in the Communication 
Department at the University of North Dakota. The principal 
eligibility criterion is that participants own a smartphone. The 
principal exclusion criterion is previous testing for radon within 
the past two years.  
Phase* or Stage:  Phase II  
Description of 
Sites /Facilities  Enrolling 
Participants : Enrolling participants was completed remotely via an online 
survey platform, Qualtrics.  
Description of Study  
Intervention /Experimental 
Manipulation : An online experiment with two experimental conditions using a 
pretest -posttest design: the radon app condition vs. brochure 
condition. Participants in both experimental conditions will 
complete an online pre -exposure survey during the baseline phase 
of the  study.  Upon completion of the pre -exposure survey, 
participants assigned to the radon app condition  will be asked to 
install the radon app on their smartphones and use the app for 
three months. App installation will be verified electronically via 
text me ssage sent to the investigators. To make the informational 
content of the radon app and EPA brochures equivalent, the 
informational content in the app condition will be repurposed 
from EPA brochures used in the brochure condition. Participants 
in the radon  app condition will have the opportunity to order a 
free radon test kit through the app at any time during the three -
month period.  
In contrast, individuals assigned to the brochure condition  will 
receive three EPA brochures for the three -month period via postal 
mails. These brochures are (1) Basic radon facts 
(https://bit.ly/2S6ryFw ); (2) A citizen’s guide to radon 
(https://bit.ly/3l3FhcJ ); and (3) Consumer’s guide to radon 
reduction ( https://bit.ly/3ibt83n ). In each mailing, participants 
will receive a pre -addressed, pre -paid postcard to request a free 
radon test kit. The postcard will be addressed to a UND address 
so that we can track the number requested by [CONTACT_199786].  
Study Duration*: 6 months.  
Participa nt Duration:  3 months .

from other cancers, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia1,2 and malignant melanoma.3 Radon causes 
more than 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the U.S.4 This number of deaths greatly exceeds 
those of other, more -publicized causes, e.g., drunk driving (17,400) and the number of homicides 
involving hand guns.[ADDRESS_238220] homes for radon. In part, this failure has a 
cognitive cause: the public’s limited knowledge about radon. Additionally, among radon -
knowledgeable individuals, the deaths have a behavioral cause; the failur e of individuals to carry 
out a series of behaviors, including obtaining a radon test kit, using it, returning the kit to the lab, 
interpreting the results, and (if warranted), remediating their homes.  
Many educational interventions concerning radon have been attempted. However, most have 
performed poorly when measured against real world outcomes like increases in radon testing. 
Importantly, most previous interventions have employed traditional forms of communication, such 
as printed brochures.6-9 Considerable evidence indicates that individuals may be more responsive 
to health information delivered via electronic media, e.g., the internet and smartphones.10 We 
recently designed a radon -education mobile application for smartphones (“the radon app”) and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-tested it in a clinical trial with [ADDRESS_238221] that the 
radon app is a promising tool for promoting radon testing.11  
The overall goal of this research is to compare the effectiveness of radon information delivered via 
the radon app vs. a traditional approach (printed brochure). The two methods will be compared on 
outcomes pertinent to the stages of individuals’ responses  to radon interventions. These stages 
include radon knowledge, attitudes toward radon testing, ordering and using a test kit, and 
returning the kit to the lab for analysis.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
In collaboration with a media services company (Triad Interactive Media, Greensboro, NC), we 
developed a radon app for smartphones.11 Briefly, the app uses a framework in HTML5 and the 
open source Twitter API. Posts created by [CONTACT_199787] -listed on Twitter. Once users log in 
via Twitter, they can view radon news and mobile -friendly informative content on radon 
repurposed from EPA brochures. Users also can access existing Tweets containing hashtags, e.g., 
#radon, #radonawareness, #radonmitigation, and #lungcancer. Individual users’ activities on the 
radon app, along with their Twitter handle, are saved on Triad Interactive Media’s s erver. Through 
the app, users could order a free radon test kit at any time.

Protocol CTR radon DaCCoTA   29 May  2024  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  8 We conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_199773]. Ninety six (96) undergraduates at the University 
of North Dakota in Grand Forks, ND (UND) were assigned to use the radon app for one month 
and were tested on several aspects of radon knowledge and testing  using a pretest -posttest design.[ADDRESS_238222] recently published our findings.11 We found that the use of the radon app: (1) significantly 
improved individuals’ radon knowledge and generated positive attitudes toward radon testing; (2) 
significantly increased self -efficacy (i.e., an individual’s perceived capability to order a radon test 
kit and use it);  (3) significantly increased response efficacy (i.e., an individual’s evaluation of the 
effectiveness of radon testing in preventing radon exposure) ;  and (4) resulted in 24% of study 
participants ordering a free radon test kit. However, only a small percentage of participants actually 
used the test kit they obtained (i.e., employed the test in their home and returned it to the lab; a 
total test compl etion rate of 9%).  
In summary, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_199774], motivation 
to test, and stimulated  requests for free test kits. However, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_199775] a key limitation : there 
was no control group (i.e., a group not exposed to the app). Our present research builds and 
improves upon these preliminary findings. To do so, we will include a control group that receives 
usual care (radon information communicated via EPA brochur es). 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
The research presents no more than minimal risk, as participants would use a smartphone  as they 
would  do normally or receive postal mails as part of experimental interventions , as indicated in a 
similar previous study .11 In other words, there are neither immediate risks nor long -term risks.  
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
This research would provide a better understanding of how to increase the public’s awareness of 
the radon issue. The immediate potential benefits would include increased awareness of the health 
threat posed by [CONTACT_199788], as indicated in our similar previous study.[ADDRESS_238223] in case participants feel any psychological/emotional distress or discomfort, they will be 
instructed to withdraw from the study at any time without losing the course point s assigned by 
[CONTACT_199789]. Also, they may meet the one -hour research requirement for their COMM 102 class 
or receive one extra credit for their COMM 110 class by [CONTACT_199790], which is 
to read an article related to this research and prepare a two -page reaction to it. Given the little to 
no risks and potential immediate and long -term benefits, the value of the information to be gained 
outweighs the risks of participation in the study.

OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ENDPOINTS  PUTATIVE 
MECHANISMS  OF 
ACTION  
PRIMARY:  The primary 
objective of this research is 
to compare the 
effectiveness of radon 
information delivered via 
the radon app vs. a 
traditional approach 
(printed brochure) on 
behavioral outcomes, i.e., 
the rate at which 
individuals order free 
radon test kits and the rate 
at which they return them 
to the lab.  1. Number of 
radon test kits 
requested by 
[CONTACT_199791]; and  
2. Number of 
radon test kits 
used and returned 
to the laboratory 
by [CONTACT_199792].  
 
 Each measure is the 
dependent variables to test 
the primary objective .    
SECONDARY:  The 
secondary objective of this 
research is to conduct a 
clinical trial to compare 
the effects of the radon app 
vs. brochures on 
increasing radon 
knowledge.  Effectiveness of 
the radon app vs. 
brochure at 3 
months re: 
changes in radon

measured by [CONTACT_199793] a 
series of 20

questions (e.g., 
“The EPA 
recommends that 
homes with 4 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_199776] (pCi/L) or 
more of radon 
should be 
fixed.”).  The radon knowledge 
variable is a key dependent 
variable to test the 
secondary objective. The 
radon knowledge variable 
may potentially serve as the 
mediator of the effects of 
the interventions on two 
measures identified as 
primary endpoints.    
[ADDRESS_238224] kits and use and return them to the laboratory for 
analysis and improving knowledge about radon (Phase II).  
Experimental design. We designed an online experiment with two experimental 
conditions ⎯the radon app condition vs. brochure condition ⎯using a pretest -posttest design. 
Study participants are undergraduates in the Communication Department at UND , indicating that 
this is a single -site trial . The principal eligibility criterion is that participants own a smartphone. 
The principal exclusion criterion is previous testing for radon within the past two years.  
We consider UND undergraduates to be an appropriate population to test the app for 
several reasons: (1)  ND has the highest residential radon levels in the U.S.2; (2) Our recent 
review of radon knowledge indicated that most individuals less than 30 years old do not know 
what radon is12; and (3) The age of many undergraduate students is similar to that of first time 
home -buyers in the U.S.13 We will assign recruited participants randomly to one of the two 
experimental conditions: app use and brochures.  
Participants in both experimental conditions will complete an online pre -exposure survey 
during the baseline phase of the study.  Upon completion of the pre -exposure survey, participants 
assigned to the radon app condition  will be asked to install the radon app on their smartphones 
and use the app for three months. App installation will be verified electronically via text message 
sent to the investigators. To make the informational content of the radon app and EPA brochures  
equivalent, the informational con tent in the app condition will be repurposed from EPA 
brochures used in the brochure condition. Participants in the radon app condition will have the 
opportunity to order a free radon test kit through the app at any time during the three -month 
period.  
In contrast, individuals assigned to the brochure condition  receive three EPA brochures 
for the three -month period via postal mails. These brochures are (1) Basic radon facts 
(https://bit.ly/2S6ryFw ); (2) A citizen’s guide to radon ( https://bit.ly/3l3FhcJ ); and (3) 
Consumer’s guide to radon reduction ( https://bit.ly/3ibt83n ). In each mailing, participants will 
receive a pre -addressed, pre -paid postcard to request a free radon test kit. The postcard will be 
addressed to a UND address so that we can track the number requested by [CONTACT_199786].  
Outcome measures.  Participants in both groups will complete the pre -exposure online 
survey at the beginning of the study and a post -exposure online survey at the three -month time 
point. This knowledge -based survey is similar to one we have used previously.11 The primary 
endpoints used to compare the two approaches are:  
1. Number of radon radon test kits requested by [CONTACT_199794];  
2. Number of radon test kits used and returned to the laboratory by [CONTACT_199795].

4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
The mode of intervention delivery, the use of a smartphone, was defined in our previously 
published pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] .11  This was a college -aged population for which smartphone use is known 
to be highly prevalent (> 92% penetration into this demographic).  Thus, this is a highly 
culturally and age -relevant intervention.  The minimally acceptable participation rate was 
determ ined by [CONTACT_199797], presented in the published paper.  These were 
exceeded.  
4.[ADDRESS_238226] completed the study if he /she has completed the baseline 
assessment  and the 3-month follow -up assessment.  
The end of th e study is defined as completion of  the 3-month follow -up assessment  shown in the 
Schedule of Activities (SoA), Section 1.3. 
[ADDRESS_238227] meet all of the following 
criteria:  
1. Reading the  informed consent form   
2. Age >= 18 
3. Own a smartphone  
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this 
study:

5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study  but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals  who do not 
meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure s) are automatically directed to the end 
of the pre -exposure survey.  
5.[ADDRESS_238229] -exposure surv eys in each 
experiment would allow them to meet an hour of participation requirement. For COMM 110, 
students receive extra .5% in their final grade per an half -hour research participation, and they are 
allowed to earn up to extra 2% (i.e., 2 -hour research participation), according to COMM 110's 
extra credit policy. The participation in both pre - and post -exposure surveys in each experiment 
would allow them to earn extra 1% for their final grade (i.e., one -hour research participation).  
Approximately 200 students are enrolled in COMM 102 each semester, and about 600 students 
are enrolled in COMM 110 each semester. They are included in the Communication Department's 
SONA website, which is the research participation pool website run by [CONTACT_8569]. Once the 
study is available on SONA website, students receive an email from SONA, and if they agree to 
participate in the study, they will sign up for the study on SONA website. They will be able to sign 
up for a [ADDRESS_238230]. Screening questions will appear 
on the next page. Those who met the eligibility criteria were then able to proceed with the 
questionnaire and randomized. Those who did not meet the eligibility criteria were directed to the 
end of the survey.  
Half of the participants  assigned to the radon app condition will be asked to provide their Twitter 
information. If  participants don't have a Twitter ID, they will be asked to create a new one prior to

successfully log in through their Twitter credentials, they will be asked to keep the app on their  
phone for three months with the notification setting "on". After all these steps are completed,  they 
will be asked to complete the pre -exposure survey. The radon app can be accessed via  computer 
or smartphone: https://radon -production.herokuapp.com/  
The other half of the participants assigned to the brochure condition will be asked to provide  the 
mailing address prior to completing the pre -exposure survey so that they can receive EPA  
brochures in the next 3 months via postal mail. Once this step is completed, they will be asked  to 
complete the pre -exposure survey.  During the 3 -month period, participants assigned to the radon 
app condition will receive the  radon educational materials via the app. Materials include the 
informational content  repurposed fr om EPA brochures and radon -education Tweets using 
hashtags, such as  #radon, #lungcancer, #healthylungs, and #radonawareness. The app uses the 
Twitter's  mechanism so that's why participants need to use their Twitter credentials to login, and 
those  hashtags used in Tweets are automatically detected by [CONTACT_9426], and will be populated in the  
app. While keepi[INVESTIGATOR_199777], if participants would like to test their homes for  
radon levels, as education materials they will be exposed to encourage to do so, they can  request a 
free radon kit through the app. They will be asked to enter their mailing address,  email, and phone 
number so that the kit will be delivered to their home address. Although the  app would collect such 
personal information, this is only to provide them with the free radon  kit, and such information 
won't be attached to their any survey responses.  On the other hand, participants assigned to the 
brochure condition  will receive a total of three  EPA brochures, with each one being delivered once 
a month. In each mailing, participants will  receive a pre -addressed, pre -paid postcard to request a 
free radon test kit. The postcard will  be addressed to a UND address so that we can track the 
number requested by [CONTACT_199798].  
Participants who completed the pre -exposure survey then received an email reminder including 
the link for the post -exposure survey three months after the completion of their pre -exposure 
survey. Participants who did not complete the post -exposure survey two weeks after the initial 
email received a reminder email.

Participant incentives:  
Students who were enrolled in COMM 110 class received 0.5 extra course credit point for the 
completion of pre-exposure survey, which was equivalent to the half -hour research participation. 
If they completed the second and final session (i.e., post -exposure survey), they received additional 
0.5 extra credit point.

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  14 Students who were enrolled in COMM 102 class met the half -hour research participation 
requirement for completing the pre -exposure survey. If they completed the second and final 
session (i.e., post -exposure survey), they met additional half -hour research pa rticipation 
requirement.  
In addition to extra credit or meeting the research requirement, students received a $[ADDRESS_238232] 
for the completion of pre -exposure survey. If they complete the second and final session (i.e., post -
exposure survey), they received another $[ADDRESS_238233].  
All students included in the Comm department's SONA research pool are 110 and 102  students, 
and they are taught by [CONTACT_199799] (110) and a designated instructor (102). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_199778] 102

6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.[ADDRESS_238234], individuals assigned to the brochure condition  will receive three EPA brochures for 
the three -month period via postal mails. These brochures are (1) Basic radon facts 
(https://bit.ly/2S6ryFw ); (2) A citizen’s guide to radon ( https://bit.ly/3l3FhcJ ); and (3) 
Consumer’s guide to radon reduction ( https://bit.ly/3ibt83n ). In each mailing, participants will 
receive a pre -addressed, pre -paid postcard to request a free radon test kit. The postcard will be 
addressed to a UND address so that we can track the number requested by [CONTACT_199786].  
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
At the baseline, participants  assigned to the radon app condition  will be asked to install the 
radon app on their smartphones and use the app for three months. App installation will be 
verified electronically via text message sent to the investigators.  In other words, the intervention 
is delivered virtually. Participants will not interact with other participants.  To make the

other participants.  In each mailing, participants will receive a pre -addressed, pre -paid postcard to 
request a free radon test kit. The postcard will be addressed to a UND address so that we can 
track the number requested by [CONTACT_199800].  
6.[ADDRESS_238236] TRAINING  AND TRACKING  
Ideally, the fidelity of delivery would be monitored by [CONTACT_199801].  However, this functionality was not 
developed for financial reasons (the app developer required more m oney that we had to spend), 
nor was there any parallel for the comparison group, since there was no way to guarantee that 
they had indeed read the brochures we sent.  However, we did verify the downloading of the app 
to the experimental group.  
With regard to adherence, this was measured indirectly, via the percentage correct of tests of 
radon knowledge.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
Participants are assigned to either the radon app or brochure condition via the randomization 
function of Qualtrics. In other words, this trial will utilize the double -blind randomization.  
There may be “contamination” of the exposures if participants assigned to the radon app share 
the app content with classmates assigned to the brochure condition. A consequence of this would 
be to dilute the effect of group exposure. Participants will be in structed not to share information 
with others about group assignment. Additionally, we will guard against this via a programming 
function that permits downloading of the radon app only by [CONTACT_199802].  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE  
Participants’ adherence with study procedures for the radon app condition will be tracked based 
on the back -end data provided by [CONTACT_199803], Triad Interactive Media. A 
complete adherence is not expected, however, because participants were asked to use the app 
occasionally as they would do for other apps. Participants’ adherence with study procedures for 
the brochure condition will be tracked based on the number of returned postal mails. A 100%

PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
When a subject discontinues from  accessing the radon app or receiving printed brochures,  but 
not from the study, remaining study procedures will be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_17143].   If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified ( including, but not limited to changes 
from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or quali fied designee will determine if any 
change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be 
reported as an adverse event (AE) . 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the 
following:  
• The reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from the intervention, and methods for 
determining the need to discontinue . 
• If the participant is due to complete assessments within 2 weeks of being discontinued 
from the study intervention, those assessments will be administered at the time of 
discontinuation; if the next scheduled assessments are more than 2 weeks from the 
discontinuation date, the discontinued participant will wait for the next scheduled 
assessment. Thereafter, the participant will be included in all future scheduled 
assessments, even though not participating in the intervention.  
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.   
An investigator may discontinue a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
• Significant study intervention non-compliance , unless varying compliance is an aspect of 
the study objectives   
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up)

an additional treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded by [CONTACT_1600]. Subjects who read the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study

they agree. All participants will be asked to answer pre -exposure survey questions measuring key 
variables, such as radon knowledge, and demographic information to be used in the analyses 
(e.g., age, gender, home -owner status, smoking status). They will then be randomly assigned to 
one of the two conditions (via Qual trics survey’s randomization function). Participants assigned 
to the radon app condition will receive instructions on how to install the app and be instructed to 
use the app for the next three months.  On the other hand,  participants assigned to the brochure 
condition will receive appropriate instructions and be asked to submit both their mailing and 
email addresses so that they can receive three brochures in the next three months and be

participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all 
of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.

Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
Informed consent  --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process 
as well as a percentage of the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate 
compliance with GCP, accuracy, and completeness.  Feedback will be provided to the study team 
to ensure proper consenting  procedures are followed .  
Source documents  and the electronic data --- Data will be initially captured on source 
documents (see Section  10.1.[ADDRESS_238248] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) and will ultimately be 
entered into the study database .  To ensure accuracy site staff will compare a representative 
sample of source data against the database, targeting key data points in that review.  
Intervention Fidelity  — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored 
throughout the intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention 
delivery are described in Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_238249] Training and Tracking .  
Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and 
will implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a

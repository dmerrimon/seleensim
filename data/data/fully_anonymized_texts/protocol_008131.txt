One of the major complications of this procedure is urinary retention postoperatively.  If a patient is not able to void on their own postoperatively they are required to go home from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a foley for bladder rest, and return to the clinic in 2-3 days to attempt a void trial once again.  At our institution the rate of urinary retention after midurethral sling requiring discharge with an indwelling foley is 25% of patients who undergo this procedure.   Pyridium is a medication widely used and of low risk to the subject. It is a urinary numbing medication often used in patients with urinary tract infections. At the discretion of the physician, medication is given prior to midurethral sling and/or other urogynecologic procedures requiring cystoscopy to confirm bilateral ureteral jet efflux. The most common medication administered in the past was indigo carmine, now that this medication is off the market. Physicians have been using alternatives for visualization of ureteral jets on cystoscopy such a methylene blue, fluorescein, or pyridium.  In this study patients undergoing midurethral slings will be randomized to one of two groups. The first group will receive pyridium preoperatively; the second will receive one 100mcg tablet of vitamin B12 as a placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  The main goal of the study is to assess whether the group of patients who receive pyridium preoperatively have a lower rate of urinary retention postoperatively versus the control group.  The secondary goal of the study is short term postoperative pain.IF NumberIF2052990Page 2 of 23

Summary - BackgroundObjectivesTo assess if there is a statistically significant difference in urinary retention after midurethral slings for stress urinary incontience in a group that receives preoperative pyridium versus a control.Background The prevalence of pelvic floor disorders in the [LOCATION_002] is estimated to be 24%, with 16% of women experiencing urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor disorders affect a significant amount of women, and this increases with age.(3) Approximately 30% of women in the [LOCATION_002] undergo corrective surgery, with a majority including incontinence surgery.  The frequency of diagnosis of urinary tract infection after a sling procedure is 34% in the first three months, and 50% in the first year following a sling procedure.(1) Patients who are discharged with an indwelling foley after midurethral sling placement, undergo a risk of urinary tract infection that reaches 30%.(2)1.

Subjects - ParticipationDuration of an Individual Subjects Participation in the StudyApproximately 1-2 days, starting with day of surgery and ending with Visual Analog Score 2-8 hours postoperativelyDuration Anticipated to Enroll All Study SubjectsApproximately 9 months according to 3-5 midurethral slings being performed at Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_360031]. This is taking into consideration patient volume and subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria.Estimated Date for the Investigators to Complete This StudyWithin two yearsProcedures for Subjects to Request WithdrawalA patient can withdraw completely from the study by [CONTACT_360038]. They can call and ask to speak to [CONTACT_360045]-Walsh at FPA, or they can email [CONTACT_360045]-Walsh or [CONTACT_360046]-Seaney and let us know of their wish to withdraw.Procedures for Investigator to Withdraw SubjectsIt is not anticipated that patients will be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_5051].  If a patient undergoes a complication in surgery necessitating an indwelling foley, or undergoes spi[INVESTIGATOR_360032], they will be removed from the study.  When the voiding trial cannot be performed as it should, because of these constraints, it will be explained to the patient that they may have been in the treatment arm and received pyridium, however, due to the exclusion criteria of the study, their data cannot be used towards conclusions for the study.Participants Will Be RecruitedYesRecruitment Method(s)Clinical PracticeHow Participants Will Be IdentifiedAny patients that are being consented for a midurethral sling procedure at FPA will be asked if they would like to participate in the study.During a patient's preoperative visit, they will be screened to see if they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. If they do, we will discuss how a cystoscopy is performed at the end of a case including a mid-urethral sling to inspect for bladder injury and uretheral patency.  It will be discussed what medications can be given to aid in visualization of ureteral jets, and how pyridium is one medication that is often used for this.  Then we will discuss that we want to test this medication to see if it decreases risks of urinary retention postoperatively.  Then we will ask if they are interested in participating in the study. Who Will Initially Approach Potential ParticipantsStudy PersonnelHow Research Will Be Introduced to ParticipantsThe research team approaching the patient asking if they are interested in the study will either be the surgeon, or fellow who will be participating in their surgery. If it is the fellow, they will be meeting the patient at the preoperative visit and discussing the study with them, in addition to being involved in the patient's surgical history and physical.It will be discussed that pyridium at times is used as standard of care during a urogynecologic procedure for visualization of ureteral patency during cystoscopy.  In this study it will also be used to assess if it decreases the rate of urinary retention after midurethral sling procedure.How Participants Will Be ScreenedPatients who are having a midurethral sling procedure, who have not previously undergone an anti-incontinence procedure will be asked if they would like to participate.Patients will be asked if they would like to participate in the study if they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Page [ADDRESS_449018] two arms with 48 patients in each arm, a total of 98 patients. Patients will be randomized with a block randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_360039] a 1:1 allocation to pyridium and vitamin B12 placebo.  The study is powered to see a difference in incidence of urinary retention after midurethral sling using 25% as the historic control for our institution. Statistical sample size was based on a decrease in incidence to 5% in the pyridium arm. This is with 80% power and alpha 0.05. Description of Procedures Being PerformedThis study will use two study groups. One group will be given Pyridium 200mg po one hour prior to surgery.  The second group will receive one 100mcg vitamin B12 tablet as a placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Patients will be randomized to either study group.  After the patient's surgery, including a midurethral sling, they will have an active voiding trial performed as described by [CONTACT_360040]. The patient's bladder will be backfilled with 300cc of sterile saline. If they cannot tolerate 300cc, they will be filled to maximum capacity. They will be allowed [ADDRESS_449019] Epic will be used to gather demographic information about patients.Description of Data that Will Be Collected Including Long-Term Follow-UpDemographics will be gathered on patients, including: age, race, BMI, preoperative urodynamics and/ or simple cystometrics, obstetrical and gynecologic history, medical and surgical history.Surgical procedures performed, if a patient passed or failed their active voiding trial.

The primary outcome is the incidence of urinary retention measured prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].   The rate of urinary retention is expected to be 25% in the control group.  The proportion of subjects experiencing a primary outcome event will be compared between the groups using a two-sided T-tests of proportions.  Assuming the proportion of patients experiencing post-op urinary retention is 25% in the control group a sample size of 48 in each group would give 80% power to detect a 20 percentage point reduction in urinary retention in the pyridium group.  Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation to pyridium and control. The secondary analyses is considered
 exploratory and will be tested at the 0.05 significance level.VAS scores (ranging from 1-10) will be collected at 2- [ADDRESS_449023] of the protocol.      Will the Research Include Data Coordinating Center Activities?NoPage 21 of 23

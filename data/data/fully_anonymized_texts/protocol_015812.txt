ABSTRACT  
 
XL184 (cabozantinib) is an oral  small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including primarily 
MET, VEGFR2 and RET . Overexpression or dysregulation of these tyrosine kinases contribute to the 
pathogenesis of a number of pediatric and adult solid tumors. XL184 has been shown to inhibit these 
tyrosine kinases in vivo  and has shown dose -dependent tumor suppression in a variety of xenograft models. 
Treatment with XL184 has also shown antitumor activity in clinical trials in adults assessing its activity in 
several tumor types. This is a limited dose -escalation study of XL184 in pediatric and adolescent patients 
with relaps ed or refractory solid tumors including CNS tumors. We will evaluate the MTD or recommended 
phase 2 dose and toxicity of XL184 administered orally on a continuous dosing schedule in the pediatric 
population. We will also preliminarily define the antitumor effects of XL184 within the confines of a phase 
I study, with a particular focus on medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) given the activity of XL184 seen in 
adult patients with MTC. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies will be conducted to further 
define the properties of XL184 in pediatric and adolescent patients.

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)  
 
1.1 Primary Aims  
 
1.1.1 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 
dose of XL184 (cabozantinib) administered orally to children with refractory 
solid tumors including CNS tumors . 
 
1.1.2 To define and describe the toxicities of XL184 (cabozantanib) administered on 
this schedule.  
 
1.1.3 To characterize the pharmacokinetics of XL184 (cabozantanib) in children with 
refractory solid tumors . 
 
1.2 Secondary Aims  
 
1.2.1 To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of XL184 (cabozantanib) within 
the confines of a Phase 1 study.  
 
1.2.2 To assess the biologic activity of XL184 (cabozantanib) . 
 
1.2.3 To assess the biomarker response (CEA and calcitonin) in patients with 
medullary thyroid cancer treated with XL184.  
 
1.2.4 To evaluate overall survival from study entry through a five -year follow -up 
period.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Overexpression or dysregulation of certain receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including 
VEGFR, MET and RET have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of tumors. 
Molecularly targeted therapy against these receptors can interrupt this signaling leading to 
tumor shrin kage and in some cases prolonged survival as seen in colorectal and renal 
cancers.1 These RTKs are overexpressed in  a variety of pediatric cancers;  VEGFR in 
pediatric sarcomas2 and MET in osteosarcoma, glioma, and papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686]3,4. 
Activating RET mutations are the driving force for the development of medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC) in patients with MEN2 , where tumors can appear early in childhood, 
particularly  in MEN2B .[ADDRESS_947787] that inhibition of VEGFR2 together with c -MET may not only 
decrease tumor size, but decrease invasiveness and metastases.8,9

Version Date: 1/31/[ADDRESS_947788], lung and MTC, transgenic RIP -Tag2 
model of pancreatic cancer and rat glioma.6 In vivo  models showed that plasma 
exposures of XL184 were similar across the models tested and that peak 
concentrations between 2 and 27 mcM were required for target inhibition and anti -
tumor activity. However , much lower trough concentrations (as low as 0.1mcM) 
were seen in these models suggesting that sustained elevated plasma levels of 
XL184 are not needed for efficacy.6   
XL184 has also been shown to block both osteoblastic and osteolytic progression 
of murine xenograft prostate tumors that express both MET and the VEGF co -
receptor NP -1. 7  
 
2.2.2 Animal Toxicology  
Cardiovascular toxicology studies in beagle dogs showed no significant effects on 
systolic blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular pressure or QT/QTc 
prolongation at doses of 150 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg. There was a transient increase 
in diastolic blood pressure (22%) that led to a 12% increase in mean arterial 
pressure at the  1000 mg/kg dose.6  
In chronic dosing toxicity studies, XL184 was well tolerated in rats and dogs with 
daily dosing for 26 weeks.7 
 
2.2.3 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies  
Preclinical pharmacology showed that XL184 is metabolized by [CONTACT_473476], 
oxidation and glucuronidation. It is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9*3 and 
CYP2C19 isoenzymes in vitro  and is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism. 
CYP3A4 induction was seen in vitro  in one of two studies with human hepatocytes 
but not with HEPG2 cell lines. XL184 is highly protein -bound (98%).[ADDRESS_947789] been 1333 adult subjects treated with XL184 in a 
variety of clinical trials. In the initial phase I study in adults, 85 patients were 
treated at doses ranging from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg/day with subsequent cohorts 
receiving fixed doses of 175 mg, 250 mg and 265 mg daily. The MTD in this study 
was 175 mg po daily (salt form; equivalent to 140 mg freebase form). Howe ver, a 
significant percentage of patients receiving this dose required dose -reductions for 
toxicity and a dose of 125 mg (100 mg freebase form) w as found to be better 
tolerated. Other studies with XL184 have also found that patients required 
significant do se-reductions with long -term treatment and based on tolerability and 
response data  at doses of 40  mg per day10, starting doses as low as 60  mg per day

DLTs in adult phase I studies were grade 3 lipase elevation, palmar -plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE), and AST/ALT elevation at 11.25 mg/kg, grade [ADDRESS_947790] also been seen including t hrombotic events, hypertension, 
hemorrhage, and rare cases of GI perforation and rectal/perirectal abscess.6,11,12 
Thirty -seven patients with MTC were treated on the initial phase I study. 17/35 
(49%) had tumor shrinkage > 30% on at least one evaluation, 10 patients (29%) 
had a confirmed partial response and 15/37 (41%) had stable disease ≥ [ADDRESS_947791] 3 months including colorectal carcinoma

2.3.2 Phase 2  and 3  Studies  
In a phase II study in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 
patients were treated with either 125 or 175 mg of XL184 on a daily schedule. 
Interim results from 124 patients revealed progression free survival at 6 months 
(PFS6) in the 175 mg  cohort was 21% for all patients. Overall response rate (ORR) 
in patients without prior antiangiogenic therapy (n=34) was 21% and 8% in 
patients who had previously received antiangiogenic drugs. Median duration of 
response was 5.9 months (range 1.9 -12.8). In the 125 mg cohort, ORR in patients 
who had not received prior antiangiogenic therapy (n=25) was 32% and mediation 
duration of response had not been met. The most frequent grade 3 /[ADDRESS_947792] 2011. Forty patients (8%)

Data from an ongoing phase III study in adults with medullary thyroid carcinoma 
(MTC) showed an increase in progression free survival in the XL184 arm 
compared to placeb o. In this study 330 patients  (median age 55 yrs (67% male) 
with RET mutation status: pos 48%; negative 12%; unknown 39%)  with 
unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic MTC were randomized 2:1 to receive 
either XL184 or placebo in a double -blind randomized fashion.  Statistically 
significant PFS prolongation of 7.2 months was observed; medi an PFS for XL184 
was 11.2 mo vs. 4.9 months with placebo (p<0.0001).  The ORR was 28% for 
XL184 and 0% for placebo (p<0.0001).16

2.3.3 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
Pharmacokinetic studies in adults show dose -proportional increases in maximal 
concentration (C max) and drug exposure (AUC) from 0.08 to 11.52 mg/kg. Steady -
state (Day 19) C max in the initial phase I study at the MTD of 175mg capsule daily 
(n=19) was 2, 310 ng/ml and AUC was 41,600 ng∙ h/ml. Steady -state C max for 
patients with GBM treated with single agent XL184 at a dose of 175mg/d was 1950 
± 1050 ng/ml (n=27) and 1350 ± 589 ng/ml for patients treated with 125mg/d 
(n=78). Half -life is reported to be between [ADDRESS_947795] of Food on the Bioavailability of c abozantinib in Healthy Adult Subjects 
(Study XL184 -004).  Study XL184 -[ADDRESS_947796] ([ADDRESS_947797]) or Reference 
(175 mg cabozantinib, dosed as one 100 mg capsule and th ree 25 mg capsules 
under fasting conditions). Blood samples were collected up to [ADDRESS_947798] after each treatment to assess plasma cabozantinib 
pharmacokinetics.  
Based on the preliminary PK data from 46 subjects who completed both 
treatments, a high fat meal did not appear to alter the terminal t1/2, z of 
cabozantinib [mean t1/2, z : 131 hours (fed) vs. 128 hours (fasted)]. The high fat 
meal significantly increased  the median tmax to 6 hours from 4 hours (fasted). The 
high fat meal also significantly increased both the cabozantinib Cmax and AUC 
values by 39% and 56%, respectively. The geometric mean ratio of Cmax 
fed/fasted was 1.39 (90% CI: 1.16 -1.67), and the geom etric mean ratio of AUC0 -
last fed/fasted was 1.56 (90% CI: 1.34 -1.80). Based on this result, cabozantinib 
should be taken on an empty stomach (fasting is required 2 hours before and 1 hour 
after each cabozantinib dose).  
Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -006, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, 
rifampin, resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in cabozantinib exposure 
(AUC values) after a sing le dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co -
administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., 
dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, 
phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may significant ly decrease cabozantinib 
concentrations.  The chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided.  
Other drugs that induce CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs 
have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) to cabozantinib (e.g., chro nic use 
of modafinil) should be avoided because of its potential to reduce cabozantinib 
exposure.  Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended.  In addition, caution must 
be used when d iscontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject 
who has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, as this could 
significantly increase the exposure to cabozantinib.

Preliminary results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184 -007, showed that 
concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, 
ketoconazole, resulted in a 33 -39% increase in the cabozantinib exposure (AUC 
values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers.  Co -
administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and 
ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib concen trations.  Grapefruit / grapefruit juice 
and Seville oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib.  
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 should be used 
with caution because these drugs have the potential to increa se exposure (AUC) to 
cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.  
Pharmacodynamic evaluation showed significantly increased PGF, VEGF -A, 
soluble MET and EPO and decreased sVEGFR2 in patient plasma after initiation 
of treatment with XL184.11 Preliminary analyses showed that baseline levels of 
Ang2, EPO and OPN significantly correlated with tumor response in a variety of 
tumor types (MTC, melanoma, colorectal carcinoma and others).6  Analysis of hair 
samples as surrogate markers revealed significant decreases in phosphorylated 
MET and downstream targets AKT and ERK (25 -54%, 20 -59% and 29 -49% 
decrease from baseline, respectively).6  
 
2.4 Pediatric Studies  
 
2.4.1 Prior Experience in Children  
There is no prior experience with XL184 in the pediatric population.  
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
This is a phase 1 limited dose -escalation study of XL184 (cabozantinib) in pediatric and 
adolescent patients with recurrent o r refractory solid tumors including CNS tumors. The 
primary objectives of this study are to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or 
recommended phase 2 dose  (RP2D) , characterize the toxicity profile and describe the 
pharmacokinetics of XL184 in pediatric and adolescent patients with solid tumors.  
 
Patients ages 2 to 18 , inclusive , with refractory or recurrent solid tumor s including CNS 
tumors will be eligible. Dosing will be based on body surface area (BSA) and rounded to 
nearest tablet to achieve the most accurate weekly doses . Doses on some days of the week 
may differ. Refer to dosing nomogram  in Appendix II  for details . XL184 will be 
administered orally at a starting dose of 30 mg/m2/day, which is roughly equivalent  to the 
well tolerated 60 mg daily dose currently being evaluated in several adult studies . Doses 
will then be escalated to 40  mg/m2 and 55  mg/m2 in subsequent cohorts. One cycle will be 
28 days in length  and dosing will be continuous . The dose will be escalated using a rolling 
six desig n. 
 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined from toxicities seen during the 
first cycle of therapy. The MTD will be the dose level immediately below the level in which 
≥ [ADDRESS_947799] received ≥ 85% of the prescribed study medication or have experienced a DLT 
during cycle 1.   
 
                              
ADVL1211  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
Page 13 
Version Date: 1/31/2019  
Doses will not be escalated beyond 55  mg/m2. If an MTD is  not identified, a recommended 
dose will be established based on tolerability, pharmacokinetic parameters and response, if 
applicable. After the MTD or recommended phase 2 dose is determined  in Part A , an 
additional 6  patients may be enrolled in an expansion phase and treated at this dose  to gain 
additional PK and toxicity data in the pediatric population. Every  attempt will be made to 
treat a minimum of 6 patients < 12 years of age  and 6 patients ≥ 12 years of age at the MTD 
or recommended phase 2 dose . Given the activity seen in patients with medullary thyroid 
carcinoma (MTC), an additional cohort for MTC patients (Part B) will be open  for 
enrollment if slots are filled for Part A , with the goal of enrolling at least four patients with 
MTC .  
 
Intra -patient dose -escalation will be allowed for patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma 
(MTC)  remaining on study once an MTD  or recommended dose  is determined to allow 
patients who  may be on study for extended periods of time, i.e. patients with MTC, the 
opportunity to receive the recommended dose.  
 
Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed before drug administration, day 21 -cycle 1 
for steady state parameters , pre C3 , if possible at any time a patient experiences a DLT, pre 
C4 and with each disease evaluation for patients enrolled after Amendment #5 A. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters including maximum concentration (C max) with the first dose 
and at steady state, area under the concentration time curve (AUC), apparent clearance and 
trough concentration will be measured or calculated.  
 
Given the antiangiogenic targeting of XL184 and concern for possible impact on growth 
in children, linear growth will be monitored and a baseline tibial x -ray for all patients, then 
prior to C2 and C5 and then [ADDRESS_947800]  will be conducted. VEGF -A, soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2), hepatocyte 
growth factor (HGF)  and soluble MET (sMET) will be measured prior to and following 
XL184 dosing and  expression of c -MET in archival tumor samples will be measured .  
 
2.6 Amendment to Open PK Expansion (January 2014)  
As of January 2014, a total of [ADDRESS_947801] been enrolled  on ADVL1211: 6 patients at 
Dose Level 1, 11 patients at Dose Level 2 and 12 patients  at Dose Level 3. During the dose 
escalation phase  (Part A) during Cycle 1 , dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in 0/6 
patients at 30 and 40 mg/m2 and 1/6 patients at 55 mg/m2 (Grade 3 fatigue and headache).  
Other Cycle 1  DLTs in expansion cohorts included Grade 2 palmar plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE) and oral mucositis in 1 patient at 40 mg/m2, Grade 3 proteinuria 
and Grade 2 hypertension (HTN) in 1 patient at 55 mg/m2, and Grade 3 HTN and reversible 
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in 1 patient at 55mg/m2.  Later cycle DLTs 
occur red in 10 patients at all dose leve ls and  include d Grade 3 weight loss (n=2), Gr ade 3 
PPE (n=2), Gr ade 3 and 4 lipase increase (n=1 each), Gr ade 4 neutropenia (n=1),  Gr ade 2 
fatigue (n=1), Gr ade 2 arthralgia (n=1) and  Gr ade 3 anorexia, dyspnea, skin ulcer (n=1).   
 
Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in 18 patients during the dose -escalation phase showed

that c abozantinib exposure was not dose proportional.  The mean ± SD steady state AUC 0-
24h at 30 mg/m2 (n=6), 40 mg/m2 (n=6) and 55 mg/m2 (n=6) was 31.9 ± 7.8, 33.3 ± 11.3 and 
33.7 ± 15 µg•h/mL, respectively. Given the toxicities seen at Dose Level 3 and in later 
cycles and comparable exposure of cabozantinib, the recommended Phase 2 dose for 
further evaluation in pediatric patients with solid tumors is 40 mg/m2 (Dose Level 2) and 
enrollment will be expanded at this dose level to gain additional pharmacokin etic and 
safety information in at least [ADDRESS_947802] trough levels with each disease evaluation in all 
patients enrolled after Amendment #5 A to gain additional information about steady state 
pharmacokinetics .-COMPLETE

5.1 Overview  of Treatment Plan  
Treatment Schedule Table  
Time  Agent  
Days 1 -28 Oral XL184 *  
*Refer to dosing nomogram in Appendix II  for dosing schedule.  
 
XL184 will be administered orally at approximately the same time as prescribed . XL184 
should be taken on an empty stomach ; patients should fast 2 hours before and 1 hour after 
taking the drug . Tablets should not be crushed or chewed; tablets should be swallowed whole. 
See also Section 9.1.6  for medications and foods to be avoided.  
 
A cycle of therapy is considered to be 28 days.   
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and  actual body 
weight measured  within 7 days  prior to  the beginning of each cycle , and according to the 
dosing nomogram (see Appendix II ).  Sites will fill out the number of prescribed tablets 
per day in the patient diary (see Appendix III ). Patients must complete the patient diary 
with the date, time and number of XL184 tablets taken  each day . The patient diary should 
be reviewed after completion of each treatment cycle.  
 
If a patient vomits after the dose of XL184 is administered, the dose should not be r epeated.  
 
If a dose of XL184 is missed and less than [ADDRESS_947828] stable disease , has again 
met laboratory parameters as defined in the eligibility section s [IP_ADDRESS] - [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] , 
and has not experienced study -drug related adverse events warranting permanent

5.3 Dose Escalation Schema  
 
5.3.1 Inter -Patient Escalation - (Part A)  COMPLETE  
The starting dose will be 30 mg/m2 (Dose Level 1) with dose levels for 
subsequent groups of patients as follows.  
 
Dose Level  XL184 Dose (mg/m2 po daily ) 
-1 23

* Starting Dose Level   
There will be no escalations beyond dose level 3 (55 mg/m2). 
 
If the MTD has been exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort of 
patients will be treated at a dose of  23 mg/ m2 (Dose Level -1).  
 
With Amendment #5 A, patients enrolled  onto Part A of the study will be treated 
at the recommended Phase 2 dose, which has been determined to be Dose Level 
2 (40 mg/m2). 
 
5.3.2 Part B : Patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)  can be accrued to a 
separate stratum if there are no available slots on Part A. These patients will be 
enrolled at one dose level below the dose level at which patients on Part A are 
actively enrolling, or at the starting dose level ( Dose Level 1) if dose escalation 
has not yet occurred.     COMPLETE  
 
With Amendment #5 A, patients enrolled onto Part B of the study will be treated 
at the recommended Phase 2 dose , which has been determined to be Dose Level 
2 (40 mg/m2). 
 
5.3.3 Intra -Patient Escalation  (Patients with MTC only ) 
Intra -patient dose escalation will be allowed for patients  with MTC  remaining on 
study in cycles of therapy subsequent to Cycle 1, once an MTD or recommended 
Phase [ADDRESS_947830] to confirm with the 
Study Chair and  the COG Phase 1 Operations office that their patient may proceed 
with an intra -patient dose escalation following the completion of Cycle 1 or 
subsequent cycles.    COMPLETE  
 
5.4 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.   All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.   A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can 
be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Any suspected or 
confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the

5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to XL184.  The DLT  observation period for the purposes of dose -escalation will 
be the first cycle of therapy.  Any drug -related toxicity that requires a dose reduction in 
Cycle 1 will also be considered a DLT.  
 
Dose limiting hematological and non -hematological toxicities are defined differently.   
 
 
5.5.1 Non-Hematological Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity a ttributable to the 
investigational  drug with the specific exclusion of:  
• Grade 3 nausea and vomiting of < 3 days duration  
• Grade 3 diarrhea ≤ 3 days duration  
• Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST/GGT /bilirubin , 
that return to levels  that meet initial eligibility criteria or baseline 
within 7 days  of study drug interruption  and that does not recur upon 
re-challenge with XL184 . Note : For the purposes of this study the 
ULN for ALT is defined as 45 U/L.  See section 6.6  for dose 
modifications for liver toxicity . 
• Grade 3 or 4 fever < 5 days duration.  
• Grade 3 infection < 5 days duration.  
• Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to supplementation  
• Grade 3 asymptomatic amylase or lipase elevation that resolves to ≤ 
Grade 1 within 7 days of study drug interruption  and that does not 
recur upon re -challenge with XL184 .  See section 6.7  for dose 
modifications for pancreatic toxicity . 
• Grade 3 proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine (P/C) ratio >  1.9) unless 
it is confirmed with a second measurement within 72 hours.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose -limiting hypertension  
• Any Grade 4 hypertension  
• A blood pressure >25 mmHg above the 95th percentile for age, 
height, and gender ( Appendix VIII ) confirmed by [CONTACT_531905].  
• In patients who begin antihypertensive therapy a blood pressure > 10 
mmHg but ≤ 25 mmHg above the 95th percentile for age, height, and 
gender ( Appendix VIII ) for > 14 days is dose limiting . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  QTc prolongation  > 500 ms that persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_698200].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any Grade 2 non -hematological toxicity that persists for ≥ 7 days and is 
considered sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by 
[CONTACT_6754].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any toxicity requiring interruption of study drug during a cycle of therapy  
                              
ADVL1211  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY

Version Date: 1/31/2019  
for ≥ 7 days or which recurs upon drug challenge.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Note: Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will 
not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
5.5.2 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematological dose limiting toxicity is defined as:  
 
• In patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]), Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/mm3) 
or Grade 4 neutropenia  (see Section 6.1 ), not due to malignant 
infiltration . 
• Myelosuppression that causes a delay of > 14 days between 
treatment cycles.  
• In patients with CNS tumors, requirement of platelet 
transfusion (s) for platelets ≤ 50,000/ mm3 on more than one 
occasion during a cycle will be considered a DLT.  I.e. If a patient 
with a CNS tumor requires more than one platelet transfusion to 
achieve a count >  50,000 /mm3 (poor initial response, etc.) on one 
occasion this is not a DLT, but if it occurs again during the cycle, 
it will be dose limiting.

Version Date: 1/31/[ADDRESS_947831] be notified of any dosage modification or use of myeloid growth 
factor.  If a patient ’s dose is reduce d due to toxicity,  any future XL184 total weekly dose 
should not exceed a previously un -tolerated dose.  
 
6.1 Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.1.1 If a patient experiences dose-limiting Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, 
the treatment will be withheld. Counts should be checked every 3 - 4 days for 
thrombocytopenia and every other day for neutropenia during this time. If the 
toxicity resolves to meet eligibility  parameters within 14 days of drug 
discontinuation, the patient may resume treatment  at the next lower dose level 
(See Appendix II B). Doses reduced for toxicity will not be re -escalated, even if 
there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_947832] be removed from protocol 
therapy . 
 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Non-Hematological Toxicity  
 
6.2.1 If a patient experiences non -hematological dose -limiting toxicity as defined in 
Section 5.5.1 , the treatment will be withheld. If the toxicity resolves to meet 
eligibility or baseline  parameters within 14 days of drug discontinuation, the 
patient may resume treatment at the next lower dose level ( See Appendix II B). 
Doses reduced for toxicity will not be re -escalated, even if there is minimal or no 
toxicity with the reduced dose.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_947833] be removed 
from protocol therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The exception to this is Grade 3 weight loss as it is unlikely that the patient 
would return to baseline within 14 days. Patients who experience Grade 3 
weight loss may resume study medication after 14 days with a dose -
reduction (see Appendix II -B) if the patient is deriving benefit from 
therapy, the weight loss has stabilized and the treating physician feels it is 
in the best interest of the patient . Patients should  be removed from protocol 
therapy if their weight loss is ≥ 20% from baseline and persists for ≥ 28 
days after the introduction of supplemental NG/G tube feeding or TPN.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_947834] be removed from protocol 
therapy .

• If urinalysis shows ≥ trace protein then obtain UPC.   
• If the urine protein/creatinine (P/C) ratio ≤ 1.9 continue XL184. If patient has 
Grade 3 proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine (P/C) ratio >  1.9), a second 
measurement should be obtained within 72 hours. A second confirmation of 
Grade 3 proteinuria will be considered a DLT.  
• If the second measurement confirms Grade 3 proteinuria (urine 
protein/creatinine (P/C) ratio >  1.9), then interrupt XL184 treatment and re -
assess weekly.   
• If XL184 is held for ≥ 14 days then remove from protocol therapy.  If the urine 
protein/creatinine (P/C) ratio  decreases to ≤ 1.9 in < 14 days then resume 
XL184 at a lower dose as outlined in Section 6.2.1 .  
• Monitor the UPC  weekly for 2 consecutive weeks once protocol therapy 
resumes.   
 
6.4 Dose Modifications for Hypertension  
 
• Baseline blood pressure  (BP) is defined as the blood pressure obtained at the 
examination used for study enrollment.  This baseline BP should be obtained as 
follows:  1) Obtain [ADDRESS_947835] 5 minut es. Avoid using the lower extremity if possible. 2) 
Average the systolic blood pressure from the 2nd and 3rd measurements.  3) 
Average the diastolic blood pressure from the 2nd and 3rd measurements.  4) The 
baseline BP is the average of the systolic over the average of the diastolic 
measurements.  
• Elevation  in either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure should be  considered 
when following the algorithm below.  
• The upper limit of normal (ULN)  is defined as a BP equal to the 95th 
percentile for age, height, and gender. See Appendix VIII . 
• The NCI CTC AE will be utilized to determine the grade of  hypertension for 
reporting purposes.  
• Elevated BP measurements should be repeated on the same day to confirm  the 
elevation. If confirmed, p atients with elevated BP should have BP 
measurements performed at least twice weekly until BP is ≤ ULN.  
• The algorithm below will be used to manage XL184 - related hypertension.  
• Hypertension should be managed with appropriate anti -hypertensive agent(s) 
as clinically indicated. It is strongly recommended that nephrology or  
cardiology be consulted in the evaluation and management of hypertension.

Arm 1 of algorithm:  
• If blood pressure (BP) ≤ 95% for age, height, and gender, continue XL184  at the same 
dose.  
 
Arm 2 of algorithm:  
• If BP ≤ [ADDRESS_947836] for age, height, and gender, continue  XL184  at the 
same dose and recheck the BP within 72 h ours. 
o If the BP is ≤ ULN on recheck, continue XL184  at the same dose.  
o If the BP remains above the ULN on recheck, then start antihypertensive therapy 
(Section 7. 7) and follow Arm 3 of the algorithm from the point that anti -
hypertensive therapy is started.  
 
Arm 3 of algorithm:  
• If BP is 11 to 25 mm Hg above the 95% for age, height, and gender on ≥ 2 of 3 
measurements or > 35 mmHg above baseline on ≥ 2 of 3 measurements, start anti -
hypertensive therapy (see Section 7. 7), continue  XL184  at the same  dose, and monitor 
BP at least twice weekly.  
o If the BP returns to ≤ ULN within 14 days, continue XL184  at the same  dose and 
continue anti -hypertensive therapy.

▪ If the BP returns to ≤ ULN within 14 days, restart XL184  at a reduced dose 
(Section 6. 1.1). 
▪ If the BP remains > ULN for more than 14 days, patient is Off Protocol 
Therapy.  
o  If the BP increases to > [ADDRESS_947838] despi[INVESTIGATOR_6698] -hypertensive 
therapy, hold XL184 , but continue the anti -hypertensive agent(s). Monitor the BP 
as clinically indicated and follow Arm 4 of the algorithm from the point that 
XL184  is held.  
▪ If the BP is ≤ ULN within 14 days, XL184  may be restarted at a reduced dose 
(Section 6.2.2 ). 
▪ If the BP is > ULN for > 14 days, the patient is Off Protocol Therapy ( Section 
10.1). 
 
Arm 4 of algorithm:  
• If BP is > 25 mm Hg above the 95% for age, height, and gender hold XL184 , monitor 
BP and administer anti -hypertensive therapy as clinically  indicated.  
o If the BP returns to ≤ ULN within 14 days, XL184  may be restarted at a  reduced 
dose ( Section 6.2.2 ). 
o If the BP is > ULN for >14 days, the patient is Off Protocol Therapy ( Section  10.1). 
 
Arm 5 of algorithm:  
• If the participant develops Grade 4 hypertension, discontinue  XL184 , monitor BP and 
administer anti -hypertensive therapy as clinically  indicated. The patient is Off Protocol 
Therapy ( Section 10.1 ). 
 
 
6.5 Dose Modifications for DVT   
If a patient develops a DVT while on study, XL184 should be held until adequate 
anticoagulation is established. Full dose anticoagulation with warfarin is not permitted.  
Heparins should be used for anticoagulation.  The drug may be resumed with a dose 
reduction if the DVT is dose -limiting (i.e. ≥ grade 3)  and if the patient is deriving clinical 
benefit.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_947839] or bilirubin.  Note: For the 
purposes of this trial the ULN for ALT is defined as 45 U/L.  XL184 may be re -administered 
at the same dose if levels of  ALT, AST and bilirubin meet eligibility criteria  or baseline  
within [ADDRESS_947840] twice weekly until eligibility criteria is met.   
 
If lab values do not resolve to initial eligibility criteria  or baseline  within 7 days of 
interruption or if toxicity recurs with re -challenge, then this will be considered dose -
limiting per section 5.5.1 .  XL184 will then be dose-reduced according to Section 6.2.1  
when eligibility criteria is met .

Grade 1. 
 
If lab values do not resolve to ≤ 1 Grade  within 7 days of interruption or if toxicity recurs 
with re -challenge, then this will be considered dose -limiting per section 5.5.1 . XL184 will 
then be dose-reduced according to Section 6.2.1  when eligibility criteria is met . 
 
6.8 Dose Modifications for Diarrhea  
See Appendix XIV  for specific guidelines for supportive care measures for patients who 
develop therapy -associated diarrhea.  
• If dose -limiting Grade 3 (> 3 days) or Grade [ADDRESS_947842] sign of 
significant diarrhea  (See Appendix XIV ).  
 
Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE; also known as hand -foot syndrome) is a 
common side effect of XL184. Careful attention should be paid to skin exams and supportive 
care instituted early if any swelling or erythematous skin changes or symptoms of pain or 
burning/tingling are noted. Patients should be instructed to apply moisturizing creams, avoid 
any trauma, harsh chemicals and limit hot water exposure. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_698201].   
 
7.4 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function can only be 
administered for culture proven bacteremia or invasive fungal infection. The Study Chair 
should be notified before growth factors are initiated.  
 
7.5 Concomitant Medications  
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H 2-antagonists  should be avoided  if possible (See Section 
9.1.6 ).  
 
Medications that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided ( see

Appendix IX). Corticosteroids may induce CYP3A4 and are therefore not routinely 
recommended on study unless deemed absolutely necessary or when used in stable or 
decreasing doses from the time of study enrollment.  
 
The use of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants is not permitted. See Appendix X III for a list 
of unacceptable enzyme inducing and recommended non -enzyme inducing 
anticonvulsants.  
 
XL184 has been associated with prolonged QTc, so medications that prolong QTc are 
prohibited and medications that may prolong QTc should be avoided when possible  (see 
Appendix XV ). 
 
7.[ADDRESS_947843] elective surgical procedures while on therapy. For patients who 
require emergent or urgent procedures, therapy may not be restarted until 28 days after 
major procedures and 7 days after minor procedures such as line replacement (3 days for 
external lines [e.g. Hickman or Broviac]) , as detailed in section 4.2. 6. 
 
7.7 Concurrent Anti -Hypertensive Therapy  
The algorithm in Section 6.4  will be used to grade and manage XL184 related hypertension. 
Should initiation of anti-hypertensive therapy be required, single agent therapy (commonly 
including the calcium channel blockers amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_6705], which are permissible 
without discussion with the study chair) should be started and the blood pressure should be 
monitor ed at least twice weekly until BP is within the 95th percentile for age, hei ght, and

have a knee MRI performed to further assess the degree of physeal 
pathology and undergo more frequent x -ray follow up. MRI should be 
performed without contrast.  
• Patients with knee MRI changes should be managed in an individualized 
manner. Decisions regarding continuation of XL184 should be made after 
discussion with the Study Chair or Study Vice -Chair and DVL Leadership, 
taking into account the presence of any symptoms referable to the knee as 
well as the patient’s response to XL184. Consultation with an orthopedic 
surgeon may also  be indicated. Plans for follow -up imaging will also be 
made on an individualized basis, taking into account the presence of 
symptoms at the knee or other join ts as well as the decision to continue 
XL184 or not.

tumor cells . Markers of bone homeostasis (eg serum bone -specific ALP, 
NTx, and CTx) may be monitored to assess the effects of cabozantinib on 
bone metabolism. Additional exploratory studies may be performed to 
characterize disease subtypes and potential biomarkers of response or 
resistance. Analyses may include but are not limited to quantification and 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_698203], evaluation of micro RNAs, and 
analyses of additional soluble markers.   
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Tissue Banking  
Archival tumor tissue slides should be submitted . If a patient does not 
have tissue available, the study chair must be notified prior to 
enrollment.  Tumor analyses may involve evaluation of the signaling 
pathways related to cabozantinib targets (eg, VEGFR, MET, KIT, RET) 
and include methods such as genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC). Broader 
genome -wide copy number and mutation profiling may also be conducted.

9.1 Cabozantinib  
(XL-184, Cabozantinib s -malate, EXEL -7184, EXEL -02977184 ) NSC# 761968    
  
9.1.1 Structure and molecular weight  
The chemical name [CONTACT_698222] N-(4-[(6,7 -dimethoxyquinolin -4-
yl)oxy]phenyl) -N’-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane -1,1-dicarboxamide, (2S) -
hydroxybutanedioate .  The molecular formula is C 28H24FN 3O5C4H6O5 and the  
molecular weight is 635.6.

9.1.[ADDRESS_947863] an oval shape.    In active 
ingredients include the following: microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH -102), 
lactose anhydrous (60M), hydroxypropyl cellulose (EXF), croscarmellose sodium 
(Ac-Di-Sol), colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate.  Inactive 
components of the yellow fi lm coating include HPMC 2910/hypromellose [ADDRESS_947864] bottles at controlled room temperature, 20 ° to 25 °C. 
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_947865] bottles is on-going. Cabozantinib  (XL184)  should be 
dispensed in its original container. Cabozantinib (XL184)  tablets are stable up to 24 
hours when dispensed in an open container , such as  in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_408200], and  are stable for  up 
to 7 days when dispensed in a closed container , such as a pharmacy dispensing bottle 
(i.e., one other than the original container ).  
 
9.1.6 Administration  
Take cabozantinib on an empty stomach ; patients should fast 2 hours before and 1 
hour after taking the drug .  Do not crush or chew the tablets; tablets should be 
swallowed whole.   
 
Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4.  Coadministration of cabozantinib  with 
medications that are strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. 
Examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers are rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, rifampentin, Phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort. Strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor s are ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir.  Refer to Section 7.5  regarding  use of 
corticosteroids.  Use alternative medications. Avoid grapefruit/ grapefruit juice , 
star fruit  and Seville oranges while participating in this trial.  Refer to Appendix  
IX for additional details.  
 
Cabozantinib is highly protein bound (99.9%).  Use caution when coadministering 
cabozantinib with medications that are highly protein -bound (e.g., diazepam, 
                                ADVL1211

furosemide, dicloxacillin, and propranolol).  Avoid administration of warfarin with 
cabozantinib as warfarin is highly protein -bound and has a very narrow therapeutic 
index.  
 
Avoid concomitant use of cabozantinib with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H 2 -
antagonists if possible. The PPIs and H 2 –antagonists may decrease cabozantinib  
plasma exposure levels and its effectiveness in humans. Examples of PPIs are 
omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole; examples of 
H2 –antagonists are ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine.  Cimetidine is a moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor.  Avoid using cimetidine with cabozatinib.  If needed, antacids are 
recommended for the initial treatment of dyspepsia or indigestion.  If antacids are not 
adequate, the use of H2 blockers (other than cimetidine) is preferred over  PPIs. If 
antacids , H [ADDRESS_947866] 2 hours (preferably 4 
hours) after taking cabozantinib  but at least [ADDRESS_947867] (CAEPR)  
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a 
single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent 
using a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the 
comprehensive list,  a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and 
italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol 
specific exceptions to expedited repo rting to NCI (except as noted below).

Below is the CAEPR for XL184 (Cabozantinib s -malate).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in 
parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination 
protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different 
SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.

9.2 Agent  Ordering and Agent Accountability  
NCI supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be 
treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior 
approval from PMB is obtained.) The CTEP assigned protocol number must be used for  
ordering all CTEP supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental  Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If 
there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_698223] i nstitution.

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
Parts of the Study : 
Part A:  Patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including CNS tumors and 
excluding patients with medullary thyroid cancer  
Part B:   Patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)        
 
A minimum of 2 evaluable patients will be entered at each dose level for determination of 
MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Part A. Once the MTD or RP2D has been 
defined, up to 6 additional patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors without hem e 
restrictions may be enrolled to acquire PK data in a representative number of young 
patients (i.e. patients < 12 years old).  Review of the enrollment rate into previous COG 
new agent studies indicates that 1 -2 patients per month are available, which wil l permit 
enrollment and determination of the MTD or RP2D within 15 -29 months if all dose levels 
are studied with six evaluable patients. A maximum of 51 patients is anticipated in Part A, 
which accounts for potential expansion to 12 patients at each dose l evel (see Section 
11.2.2 ) and an inevaluability rate of 20%.  COMPLETE  
 
Patients with medullary thyroid cancer may enroll to Part B of the study if there are no 
available slots on Part A. Part B will enroll concurrently at one dose level below that of 
solid tumor patients enrolled in Part A. If dose escalation has not yet occurred in Part A, 
patients in Part B will enroll at the initial dose level 1. Up to 6 patients may be enrolled 
onto ea ch lagging dose level, for a maximum total of 18 evaluable patients in Part B.  
COMPLETE  
 
Once the MTD or RP2D is identified, intra -patient dose escalation will be allowed for 
patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) remaining on study in cycles of therapy 
subsequent to cycle 1, provided that  the patient did not experience dose -limiting toxicity 
(DLT) at the dose at which they began therapy . Patients who are one dose level below the 
MTD  or RP2D can escalate to the MTD  or RP2D . Patients who are more than one dose 
level below the MTD  or RP2D can escalate one dose level per cycle until they reach the 
MTD  or RP2D as long as they do not experience a DLT when escalating .  COMPLETE   
 
The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with solid tumors was determined to 
be 40 mg/m2 (see details in Section 2.6 ).  In order to acquire additional PK data at this dose 
level, an additional 6  evaluable patients will be enrolled for a total of 12 evaluable patients 
at this dose level (6 < 12 years of age and 6 ≥ 12 years of age).  If at any time cycle 1 DLT 
occurs in ≥ 33% of evaluable patients in Part A at 40 mg/m2, the maximum tolerated dose 
will have been exceeded and the cohort will be closed to further enrollment.  Part B will 
remain open with Part A at 40 mg/m2 (the RP2D) to patients with MTC and may enroll a 
maximum of 6 evaluable patients (4 more in addition to the 2 already enrolled).  Part B 
will close to enrollment when the PK cohort in P art A at 40 mg/m2 has completed 
enrollment, or if 2 or more out of 6 evaluable patients in the Part B cohort experience cycle 
1 DLT.  Up to 12 additional patients will be enrolled for a maximum total of 41 patients  in 
the study, which accounts for a 20% inevaluability rate.  It should take an additional 3 -6 
months for completion of enrollment.

Page 46 
Version Date: 1/31/[ADDRESS_947872] 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines and had the appropriate 
toxicity monitoring studies performed are also considered evaluable for Adverse 
Effects. Patients who are not evaluable for Adverse Effect s at a given dose level 
will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose (Part A) : COMPLETE  
The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one -third of patients 
experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy. In the event that two 
DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are different classes of Adverse Effects 
(e.g. hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression), expansion of the cohort to 12 
patients will be considered if all of the following conditions are met:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose -related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice chair, 
and IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  
 
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose -limiting 
toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.  
 
11.3 Dose Escalation and Determination of MTD :- COMPLETE  
 
The rolling six phase [ADDRESS_947873] of this study. 17 Two to six 
patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of 
patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced 
DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients  entered but with tolerability 
data pending at the current dose level.  Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has 
enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the 
cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity ). For example, 
when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is available for all 
three when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and 
the fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent d ose level. If data is not yet available 
for one or more of the first three participants and no DLT has been observed, or if one 
DLT has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if 
two or more DLTs have been observed, th e dose level is de -escalated. This process is 
repeated for participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three 
participants, accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants 
are inevaluable for toxicity, t hey are replaced with the next available participant if 
escalation or de -escalation rules have not been fulfilled at the time the next available 
participant is enrolled onto the study.

the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective treatments on the one 
hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the 
other. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are noted, 
accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those 
differences more fully.

11.5 Pharmacokinetic and Correlative Studies and Response Analysis  
 
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of XL184  will be performed to 
define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK 
parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, medians, 
ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution  permit).   
 
While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of XL184  patients will have 
disease evaluations performed as indicated in Section 8.[ADDRESS_947875] criteria for patients with solid tumors, and will be reported 
descriptively.  Overall survival from study entry will also be assessed and summarized 
using the Kaplan -Meier method at the 6 month, 12 month, and 5 year timepoints.  
 
All these analyses  will be descriptive and exploratory  and hypotheses generating in nature .

12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
12.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_947876] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.   A 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
12.2 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors  
See the table in section 8.0  for the schedule of tumor evaluations. In addition to t he 
scheduled scans, a confirmat ory scan should be obtained 21-28 days following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -
247, 2009].  Key points are that [ADDRESS_947877]  
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria.  
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluable for objective response : Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle [ADDRESS_947878] had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of 
measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -
target disea se.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.   
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_947879] x -ray, as ≥[ADDRESS_947880] scan, or ≥[ADDRESS_947881] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).   
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator 
thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which 
such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol .

Page 50 
Version Date: 1/31/2019  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_947882] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardi al 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as 
non-measurable.   
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection  as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeat ed 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included  in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize 
any objecti ve tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.

All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_947883] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickn ess.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans). Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document 
that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identic al diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over tim e.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  
If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease.

[IP_ADDRESS]  FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional 
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression 
(particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, addit ional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date 
of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of  disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
 
12.2.4  Response Criteria  for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <[ADDRESS_947884] be detected by [CONTACT_6777].  
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demons trate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions 
is also considered progressions). Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non -target or non -
measu rable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
                                ADVL1211   
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
 
Page 53 
Version Date: 1/31/2019  
an overall level of substantial worsening in non -
target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis)  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.     
 
12.2.[ADDRESS_947885] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.8 from a sequence of overall response assessments.  
 
12.3 Biomarker Response Criteria for Patients with MTC  
 
Patients with MTC will use the response criteria outlined above in Section 12.2  to 
evaluate response and progression . Additional biomarker response data will be collected 
in patients with tumor markers (CEA and/or calcitonin) 2x ULN at baseline . 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Normalization (≤  ULN) of CEA or calcitonin 
(CTN) level following treatment, confirmed with 
a repeat CEA/CTN level at least 4 weeks apart.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : A ≥ 50% decrease in the CEA or CTN level 
relative to the baseline level, confirmed with a 
repeat CEA/CTN level at least 4 weeks apart.  
                                ADVL1211

Version Date: 1/31/2019  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : A ≥ 50% increase in the CEA or CTN relative to 
the prior value on [ADDRESS_947886] 4 weeks apart (e.g., if the last prior CTN 
value was 1,000 pg/ml, consecutive values of 
1,500 pg/ml and then 2,250 pg/ml at least 4 weeks 
later would represen t progression). The patient 
must have been taking XL184 for [ADDRESS_947887] 
continued to take the drug through the time that 
the second measurement was drawn.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : <50% increase or decrease in CTN or CEA level 
relative to the baseline level.

measures.   
 
12.4.2  Complete Response  
Disappearance of all evaluable disease.  
 
12.4.3  Partial response  
Partial responses cannot be determined in patients with evaluable disease  
 
12.4.4  Stable Disease (SD)  
That which does not qualify as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response  (PR), 
or Progressive Disease.  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_947889] Response Assessment

Version Date: 1/31/[ADDRESS_947890] show viable neuroblastoma.  
 
12.5.2  The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:   
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions  
Progressive disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions  
 
12.5.3  The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess 
efficacy for study endpoint. See Section 8.3.1 for details on transferring images 
to the Imaging Research Center.   
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_6779].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 

                                ADVL1211   
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
 
Page 56 
Version Date: 1/31/2019  
 
The relative score is calculated by [CONTACT_99239] -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved. 
If morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6713], no tumor cells can be detected by [CONTACT_6783][INVESTIGATOR_6714] 21 
days apart to be considered a Complete Response . 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced).  
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
12.5.[ADDRESS_947891] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as  described in Table 5 in Section 12.8. 
 
12.6 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
12.6.1  Bone Marrow Involvement   
Bone marrow obtained within 28 days  prior to study enrollment  with tumor cells 
seen on routine morphology (not by [CONTACT_442837]) of 
bilateral aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99203].  
 
Bone Marrow responses are determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone marrow 
biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] [ADDRESS_947892] 21 days  apart. Normalization of urinary 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at 
study enrollment.  
 
Progressive Disease:   In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_6786] a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND 
a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_5293]. (For example, a patient entering with 5% 
tumor in marrow by [CONTACT_6787] ≥ 25% 
tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 
30% tumor must increase to > 60%).  
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma 
in bone marrow will be defined as progressive disease if 
tumor is detected in [ADDRESS_947893] 21 days  apart.

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
 
Page 57 
Version Date: 1/31/2019  
Stable Disease:  Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive 
disease.  
 
12.6.[ADDRESS_947894] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as  described in Section 12.8. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_947895] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If 
multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Targ et lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the 
thickness of the slic es showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect 
(e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
Any change in size of non -target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.  
 
12.7.[ADDRESS_947896] perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesi ons – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the 
initial baseline measurements.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.

Page 58 
Version Date: 1/31/2019  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the  sum of the products 
of the  perpendicular diameters of the target lesion s, taking as reference the 
smallest sum of the product s observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
12.7.5  Response Criteria for Non -Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non -target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
 
12.7.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
12.7.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The 
overall response a ssessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are r eported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the data collection packet 
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6716].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 4.[ADDRESS_947900] access to a copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3 :  Review Table A  in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements.   
 
Note :  This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_947901] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the 
agent(s) must also be repor ted according to the instructions  in the table  
below . Attribution categories are as follows:  Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possible, Probable, and Definite.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 
21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via CTEP -

• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A ) to NCI via 
the web at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  
(telephone CTEP at: ([PHONE_034] within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event if 
the CTEP -AERS  24-Hour Notification web -based application is unavailable) and by 
[CONTACT_99243] . Once internet connectivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_947907] be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_10064].  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event  (refer to Table A ). 
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.h
tm. 
 
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 
13.3.1  CTEP -AERS  Reporting  
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System ( CTEP -AERS ) that can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
 
A CTEP -AERS  report must be submitted electronically  via the CTEP -AERS  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_eve
nts.htm . If prompted to enter a sponsor email address, please type in: 
[EMAIL_1961] . 
 
Fax supporting documentation to the NCI (fax # [PHONE_100] ) and send by [CONTACT_463556]1211 COG Study Assigned  Research Coordinator.  ALWAYS 
include the ticket number on all faxed and emailed documents . 
 
13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG data 
submission forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
 
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_947908] (most severe) 
grade of the Adverse Effects.  
 
13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline  or less than Grade 1, whichever level is higher  (note that the resolution 
date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE 
decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
                                ADVL1211   
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY

Version Date: 1/31/2019  
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_947909] be reported 
each course it r ecurs.  
 
13.5 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_6681]  
 
13.5.1  Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP -AERS  reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the data 
form packet (See Section 14.1 ). 
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_947910] reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to 
the FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for 
industry sponsored trials).  
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_947911] responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS  
All cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients on NCI -sponsored trials following their chemotherapy for cancer must be 
reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluati on 
Program (CTEP) via CTEP -AERS  and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm 
reporting requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the 
completed CTEP -AERS  report within 14 days of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after 
treatment for cancer on NCI -sponsored trials.  
 
Secondary Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  (e.g., acute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML]) ,  
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS) , or  
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.   
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms out lined in each protocol.  
Second Malignancy :  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.

13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
When submitting CTEP -AERS  reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and faxed along with any 
additional medical information to (301) 230 -0159 ( Appendix VI). Copi[INVESTIGATOR_698204]1211 COG Study Assigned Research 
Coordinator. The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent should 
be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS  report.  
 
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy 
occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_947912] dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited m anner via CTEP -AERS  as 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (Pregnancy) 
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC and 
reported as Grade 3.  
 
• Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. The “Pregnancy 
Information Form” should be used for all follow -ups. If the baby [CONTACT_521474] a birth defect or other anomaly, the n a second CTEP -AERS  report is 
required.  
 
13.7.2  Fetal Death  
• Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “ A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_293861]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after expulsion 
from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation. ” 
 
•  Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy,  
puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss)” under the  
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC.   
 
•  A fetal death should NOT be reported as “Fetal death,” a Grade 5 event  
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC,  as 
currently CTEP -AERS  recognizes this event as a patient death.  
 
13.7.3  Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by  
[CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life” that is felt by  
[CONTACT_698217]/intervention, should be reported expeditiously.  
 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “General 
disorders and administration - Other (neonatal loss)” under the General 
disorders and administration SOC.  
 
• Neonatal death should NOT be reported as “Death neonatal” under the 
General disorders and administration SOC, a Grade 5 event. If reported as

APPENDIX  VII:  URINE PROTEIN TO CREATININE (UPC) RATIO  
 
 
Clinical Meaning of UPC  
There is a good correlation between the ratio of urine protein to creatinine concentrations (UPC) in a random 
urine sample and the amount of protein excreted in a 24 -hour urine collection period .18 Thus, the UPC 
allows for an estimation of the 24 -hour urine protein excretion from a random sample.  The creatinine 
excretion is fairly constant throughout the day regardless of changes in urine flow rate:  
• Men excrete 20 mg to 25 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day  
• Women excrete 15 mg to 20 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day  
• Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 150 mg per 24 hours.  
• The UPC ratio is roughly equal to the 24 hour urine protein excretion in g/day  
 
 
Calculating UPC Ratio  
UPC ratio = (Urine protein [mg/dL]) / (urine creatinine [mg/dL]) = numerically equivalent to grams (g) 
protein excreted in urine over 24 hours.  
 
Example :  If a s ubject has a urine protein of 90 mg/dL and urine creatinine of 30 mg/dL ,   
then UPC ratio =  90 (mg/dL)   = 3 
30 (mg/dL)  
Result UPC is 3 correlat ing to roughly 3g of protein excretion in a 24 -hour period.  
 
 
Units for UPC ratio  
UPC is a calculated ratio. The guidelines in the protocol are based on having urine protein and urine 
creatinine measured in the same units (e.g., mg/dL). The SI units for urine protein and urine creatinine are 
not the same, so these must be converted to m g/dL before calculating the ratio.  For reference, the 
conversion factors for commonly used units for protein and creatinine are provided below.  
 
Starting units  Conversion to mg/dL  
Protein (g/L)  Multiply by 100  
Creatinine ( mol/L)  Divide by 88.4 
Creatinine (mmol/L)  Multiply by 11.3

APPENDIX  XIV:  PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR TREATING DIARRHEA  
 
Guidelines for the Treatment of Diarrhea  
 
Institutional practice may be used  in place of these guidelines.  
 
Each family will be instructed to have antidiarrheal medication available and begin treatment at the first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_527301]. Patients will  also be instructed to contact [CONTACT_99256]. Patients will be given loperamide  based on body weight. The doses and schedules for loperamide 
included here are higher than the standard but consistent with COG protocols D9802, P9761,  ARST0121, 
and ADVL0918.  
 
Be aware of your child's bowel movements. At the first sign they become softer than usual or if your child 
has any  notable  increase in the number of bowel movements over what is normal for him/her, begin taking 
loperamide (Imodium).  
 
Please follow these directions carefully, using dosing guidelines below:  
• Take _____________  at the first sign of diarrhea.  
• Continue taking  __________   every 2 hours until the diarrhea slows or the normal pattern of 
bowel movements returns. Repeat the same doses and frequency if the diarrhea returns.  
• Do not exceed ___________ in a 24 hour period.  
• Please call your doctor if you have any questions about taking loperamide, if your child's diarrhea 
is not under control after two days, or if he/she is feeling extremely weak, lightheaded, or dizzy.  
• Make an extra effort to give your child lots of fluids (several glasses of pedialyte, fruit juices, 
soda, soup, etc.) while your child is participating in this study.  
• Side effects may include tiredness, drowsiness or dizziness. If your child experiences these side 
effects, or if your child is urinating less frequently than usual, please contact [CONTACT_51443]'s 
physician.  
• Do not give your child any laxatives without consulting with his/her physician.

LOPERAMIDE DOSING RECOMMENDATIONS  
(NOTE: maximum dose of loperamide for adults is 16 mg/day)  
ALL patients: discontinue loperamide when the patient is no longer experiencing significant diarrhea.  
Weight (kg)  ACTION  
<13 kg   Take 0.5  mg (one -half teaspoonful of the 1 mg/5 mL oral solution) after the first 
loose bowel movement, followed by 0.5  mg (one -half teaspoonful of the 1 mg/5 
mL oral solution) every 3 hours.  During the night, the patient may take 0.5  mg 
(one-half teaspoonful of the 1 mg/5 mL oral solution) every 4 hours.  Do not 
exceed 4  mg per day.  
 
≥ 13 kg to < 20 kg  Take 1  mg (1  teaspoonful of the 1 mg/5 mL oral solution or one -half capsule or 
tablet) after the first loose bowel movement, followed by 1  mg (one teaspoonful 
of the 1 mg/5 mL oral solution) every 3  hours. During the night, the patient may 
take 1 mg (one teaspoonful of the 1 mg/5 mL oral solution) every 4 hours.  Do not 
exceed 6  mg per day.  
 
≥ 20 kg to < 30  kg Take 2  mg (2 teaspoonfuls of the 1 mg/5 mL oral solution or 1 capsule or tablet) 
after the first loose bowel movement, followed by 1  mg (one teaspoonful of the 1 
mg/5 mL oral solution or one -half capsule or tablet) every 3 hours.  During the

APPENDIX XVI: CTEP AND CTSU REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) policy require all 
individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and to renew their registration annually.  To 
register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Acce ss 
Management (IAM) account ( https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ).  In addition, persons with a registration type 
of Investigator (IVR), Non -Physician Investigator (NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6731]), or Associate Plus (AP) (i.e., clinical site staff 
requiring write access to OPEN, RAVE, or TRIAD or acting as a primary site contact) must complete  their 
annual registration using CTEP’s web -based Registration and Credential Repository (RCR) 
(https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr).  Documentation requirements per registration type are outlined in the table 
below.

CTSU Registration Procedures  
 
This study is supported by [CONTACT_6818] (CTSU).  
 
IRB Approval:   
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol and 
submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can be 
approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Support System 
(RSS) uses extensive data to make  a determination of whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria 
including but not limited to the following:  
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization  
• A valid IRB approval  
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements . 
 
In addition, the site -protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572  
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site.  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by [CONTACT_698221]. For sites using the CIRB, IRB 
approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process. Signatory 
Institutions  must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager 
to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then commu nicated 
to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Institution 
must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are 
participating in the study.  
 
Requirements for ADVL1 211 Site Registration:  
 
• IRB approval (For sites not participating via the NCI CIRB; local IRB documentation, an IRB -signed 
CTSU IRB Certification Form, Protocol of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB 
Certification/Declaration of Exemption Form, or combination is accepted )  
• For applicable studies with a radiation and/or imaging (RTI) component, the enrolling site must be 
aligned to a RTI provider.  To manage provider associations access the Provider Association tab on 
the CTSU website at https://www.ctsu.org/RSS/RTFProviderAssociation , to add or remove 
associated providers.  Sites must be linked to at least one IROC credentialed provider to participate on 
trials with an RT component. Enrolling sites are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate 
agreements are in place with their RT I provider, and that appropriate IRB approvals are in place.   
 
Submitting Regulatory Documents:  
Submit required forms and documents  to the CTSU Regulatory Office, where they will be entered and 
tracked in the CTSU RSS.  
 
Regulatory Submission Portal: www.ctsu.org   (members’ area) → Regulatory Tab →Regulatory

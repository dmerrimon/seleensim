CONFIDENTIAL Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of CNSA -001 as measured by [CONTACT_145398] -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), including assessment of severity of TEAEs, and changes in clinical 
laboratory  and HbA1c  tests, vital signs, and physical examinations  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the  change in maximal tolerated volume consumed during the 
nutrient satiety test from Day [ADDRESS_166258] of changes in the following from baseline to  Day 14 and 
baseline to Day 28 (±1 day):  
 GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale  
(heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal 
pain, and lower abdominal pain) scores  
 Gastric emptying as measured by [CONTACT_145399]:  
The following study populations will be analyzed:  
 Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study drug 
(CNSA -001 or placebo ) 
 Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study drug 
(CNSA -001 or placebo), an d had available  Day [ADDRESS_166259] maximum 
tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population . Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and p ercentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and treatment group . Severity of 
AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study dru g and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a 
listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each visit as 
will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal phys ical 
examination results will be provided.  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The change s from Day [ADDRESS_166260] will be 
compared between treatm ent groups using a student’s t -test. Results from the nutrient satiety test  
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29,  and the  GCSI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) through Day 14 (+1) and 
through Day 28 (±1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group . The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided . 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan .

CONFIDENTIAL 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis  
Gastroparesis is characterized by [CONTACT_145400]; symptoms are chronic with epi[INVESTIGATOR_145356] ( Parkman et al,  
2004).  Gastroparesis affects women 4  times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998 ). Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accounts for most cases, but gastroparesis is frequently associated with diabetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis) (Soykan, et al, 1998 ; Karamanolis et al, 2007 ). Several 
cross-sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30 % 
to 50% of patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes ( Horowitz et al, 2002 ). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983 ).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis (Stacher,  
2001; Parkman et al,  2004 ). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri et al,  2013).  
At a molecular level, attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by [CONTACT_145401] ( Wood et al, 1999 ). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric oxide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter 
in the regulation of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003 ); it is the principal nonadrenergic 
noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. In diabetic rats,  which serve as a 
model for type 1 diabetes, nNOS expression was found to be impaired. This impairment in 
nNOS messenger RNA expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the proximal 
stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997 ). It has been demonstrated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats, female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls, and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabetic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats 
(Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis by [CONTACT_145402] (92% to 96%), 
vomiting (68% to 88%), postprandial fullness (54% to 77%), early satiety (42% to 60%), and 
upper abdominal pain (36% to 85%) ( Soykan et al, 1998 ; Hoogerwerf et al,  1999 ; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009).  Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of severity. Pain is less prevalent in diabetic gastroparesis than idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose control because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may,  in turn,  affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition,

CONFIDENTIAL esophagitis, and Mallo ry-Weiss tears. Gastroparesis adversely affects the lives of patients 
with the disease, resulting in decreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression ( Soykan et al,  1998 ; Parkman et al,  2004 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_166272] gastric hypersensitivity, 
especially in the postprandial state, and impairment of the postprandial accommodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008 ). The stomach functions as 2 separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure,  
and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. Receptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated resulting in the release of NO and activation of nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation and pyloric 
relaxation in response to a meal (Ishiguchi et al, 2001 ). 
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss 
in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis (Karamanolis et al, 2007 ). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a 
nutrient meal (Kumar et al, 2008 ). In the distal stomach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that triturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closure; lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation (Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
Several co-factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH), calcium,  and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
(Werner et al, 2003 ). The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase ( NOS ) is regulated by [CONTACT_8060]4 (Werner et al, 2003 ). In the absence of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in further impaired 
nNOS bioactivity. 
1.[ADDRESS_166273] been targeted at accelerating gastric emptying or controlling 
symptoms. Available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_145357]. These include metoclopramide (Snape et al, 1982 ), erythromycin ( Arts et al, 2005 ), 
and domperidone (not available in the [LOCATION_002] [US]) (Prakash and Wagstaff, 1998 ). 
There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline symptom severity 
(Karamanolis et al, 2007 ; Talley et al, 2001 ) and in response to therapeutic intervention.  In 
part, as a result of lack of understanding of the underlying pathogenesis that leads to 
alterations in GI motility and sensation, medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_145358].   
The first-line medical therapy for patients with diabetic gastroparesis  is generally a 
combination of an antiemetic agent in addition to the promotility drug. Unfortunately, many  
patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despi[INVESTIGATOR_145359]-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination prokinetic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric 
stimulation  (Fass, 2010 ; Camilleri et al, 201 3).

available product,  was administered at equivalent doses for the first 3  dose levels (2.5 mg/kg, 
7.5 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg). Dose-dependent correlations between CNSA-001 and plasma 
BH4 concentr
ations were observed with each successive dose level. Dose proportionality was 
observed between the top 2  dose levels (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) and resultant BH4 
concentrations. Administration with a standard high-fat (approximately 50 percent of total 
caloric content of the meal) and high calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal 
resulted in approximately 80% higher plasma BH4 concentrations (area under the

TEAEs in subjects who received CNSA 001 were mild or moderate and consistent with the 
TEAEs in subjects 
who received placebo: TEAEs were experienced by 10 subjects (55.6%, 
10/18) who rec

4 subjects (66.7%, 4/6) who received placebo. No TEAEs were severe, serious, or led to 
discontinuation. Of the 10 TEAEs reported in subjects who received CNSA-001, only 4 were 
judged to be related to study drug, and,  of the 4 TEAEs reported in subjects who received 
placebo, only 1 was judged to be related to study drug. Somnolence, fatigue, headache, and

CONFIDENTIAL 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
Study GAS -001 is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_145364]-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) powder for suspension administered orally in 
women with moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis. This is an outpatient study in which 
up to 20  patients will be enrolled at approximately 4  centers. 
The Schedule of Events is provided in Appendix 1. The study schema is displayed in Figure 
1.  
Screening Period (Day -28 Through Day 1 Predose) 
An informed consent for
m (ICF) must be signed before any study-related procedures are 
performed. After providing consent, patients will undergo Screening procedures to determine 
study eligibility, as indicated in Appendix 1. Patients who are eligible based on Screening 
evaluations will undergo baseline evaluations before initiation of study drug (CNSA-001 or 
placebo), be randomized, and proceed to the Treatment Period.  
Treatment Period (Day 1 Through Day 14) 
Following the Screenin
g Period and completion of baseline evaluations, all randomized 
patients will take their first dose of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) on Day 1 while in the 
clinic. Patients will undergo procedures during the Treatment Period as indicated in 
Appendix 1. 
Study drug may be prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, as described in 
Section 6.14.1 . Patients may also withdraw from the study for any reason, as described in 
Section 6.14.2 . If a patient discontinues study drug early, the patient should return to the 
study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the 
End of Treatment (EOT) ( Section 7.5, Appendix 1). If a patient withdraws early from the 
study before undergoing EOT evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site 
within 24  hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EOT 
(Section 7.5, Appendix 1). If a patient withdraws from the study before undergoing End of 
Study (EOS) evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site within 24 hours 
of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EOS ( Section 7.6, 
Appendix 1).  
End of Treatment Period (Day 14 Through Day 15 Evaluations) 
Patients will undergo EOT evaluations on Day [ADDRESS_166279] 
(Section 6.7) on Day 14. The GCSI ( Section 6.8, Appendix 2 ) and PAGI-SYM ( Section 6.9, 
Appendix 2 ) will also be administered on Day 14 (+1 day), and the GEBT ( Section 6.10) will 
be conducted on Day 15.

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
CNSA-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH4 via the pterin salvage pathway. Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multi
ple ascending-dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by [CONTACT_145407][INVESTIGATOR_145365]4 . It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA-001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired ( Xu et al, 2007 ). 
CNSA-001 was studied in two 14 -day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies,  as 
described in Section 5.3, and in a single and multiple ascending-dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU-001, as described in Section 1.5.

their assigned study drug, the study design of a randomized study of CNSA-001 versus

Clinical Trial Protocol: GAS- [ADDRESS_166282] is CNSA-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) oral powder for suspension. CNSA-001 contains 
the new chemical entity, sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]. Sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145360] 2-amino-6 -[(2S)-2 -hydroxypropanoyl]-
7,8-dihydro-1H-pteridin-4-one with a molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of 
C9H11 N5O3. Inactive ingredients in CNSA-001 include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, and ascorbic acid. CNSA-001 will be suspended in Medisca® 
Oral Mix prior to dispensing it to the patient.  
5.1.2 Placebo Control 
The placebo is a ready-made suspension containing microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid,  and colorant (Yellow No. 6) that is suspended 
in Medisca® Oral Mix.  
5.2 Treatments Administered 
Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1 :1 to the following treatment groups :  
• CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day (1 0 mg/kg BID) for 14  days 
• Placebo BID for 14 days 
Dosing of CNSA-001 is based on the patient’s weight. The weight obtained on Day -[ADDRESS_166283] amount ( mg) of CNSA-001 active ingredient (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) 
required for each patient’s daily dose.   
The placebo is  formulated as ready-made suspension. The placebo will be administered in the 
same manner (volume) as CNSA-001 . 
Details on preparation of study drug and dosing guidelines will be provided in a pharmacy 
manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients.   
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
All patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1 :1 to receive CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day 
(10 mg/kg BID) or placebo BID.  
The CNSA
-[ADDRESS_166284] level from both studies was set at 
1000 mg/kg/day,  which represents a human equivalent dose of 161.3 mg/kg/day based on 
allometric scaling. Consequently, the proposed dose of 20 mg/kg/day represents an 8.1 -fold 
safety margin.

CONFIDENTIAL Study drug will be dispensed on Day 1 (Section 6.11) with a dosing diary in which patients 
will record all doses taken and times they were taken (Section 5.8.1 ). The first dose on Day [ADDRESS_166285] (Section 6.7). 
If a patient vomits after taking a dose of study drug,  the patient should wait until the next 
scheduled timepoint to take another dose.  A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, 
but >2  doses should not be taken on the same day. 
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients  to Treatment Groups 
Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria and provide informed consent will be randomized 
in a ratio of 1:1 to the CNSA-001  or placebo group via the randomization scheme generated 
for the study.  Patients who are randomized will be considered to be enrolled.  
5.5 Blinding 
This study has a double-blind design. The Investigator, study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study drug is being received. Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site) personnel will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug. 
Patients 
will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential for the clinical management or welfare of a specific patient, may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_145368]. If emergency 
unblinding is required, the Investigator will have immediate access to individual sealed codes 
containing treatment allocations. However, before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate 
Sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible and without revealing the patient’s study drug 
assignment (unless important to the safety of patients remaining in the study), the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and the Investigator 
was unable to contact [CONTACT_145409]. The Investigator will record in 
source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment 
for any p atient and  the names and roles of personnel unblinded. 
5.6 Concomitant T
herapy 
Patients will be permitted to take:  
 Analgesics, including narcotics, if the patient has been on a stable dose of the 
medication for >30 days before randomization; dose escalation is NOT permitted 
during the study through the EOT

Clinical Trial Protocol: GAS- [ADDRESS_166294], patients consum e 120 mL of Ensure™ every 4 minutes. At 
5-minute intervals, patients score their fullness using a rating scale that combines verbal 
descriptors on a scale graded 0 to 5 (0: no symptoms, 1: first sensation of fullness [threshold], 
2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: maximum or unbearable fullness). Patients are told to 
stop when a score of 5 is obtained. The actual volume of Ensure™  consumed at this point is 
the maximum tolerated volume. Symptoms are measured [ADDRESS_166295] 
with patient s scoring each symptom of bloating, fullness, nausea and pain on a visual 
analogue scale with 100-mm lines and the words “unnoticeable” and “unbearable” as 
anchors. The sum of the four 100- mm visual analogue scales provides an aggregate symptom 
score (Park, 2011 ). 
The nutrient satiety test will be administered in the clinic at Screening, on Day 1 (predose),  
and on Day [ADDRESS_166296] volume of ≤600 mL at Screening is required for patients to participate in this study.

(Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ), will be administered in the clinic at Screening and on Day 1 
(predose), Day 14 (+1 day), and Day 28 (±1 day). A GCSI score >21 at Screening, indicating 
moderate to severe sy
mptoms, is required for patients to participate in this study. 
6.9 Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Symptom 
Severity 
The PAGI-SYM  (Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI symptom severity instrument with 
6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper 
abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. It will be administered in the clinic on Day 1 
(predose) and on Day 14 (+1 day), and Day 28 (±1 day).  
6.[ADDRESS_166297],  will be administered in the clinic on 
Day -1 , Day 15, and Day 27 or Day 29 after the patient has fasted overnight (a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_166298]). At the clinic, the patient provides baseline (premeal) breath samples and then 
consumes a standardized 230 kCal meal,  consisting of a proprietary standardized 13C-labeled 
egg component (which is rehydrated and then microwaved for 1.5 minutes) and 6 saltine 
crackers
, accompanied by 6  ounces of water. The meal is to be consumed within 10 minutes. 
Single postmeal breath samples are collected in capped glass tubes at 45, 90, 120, 150, 180,

intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related. 
The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) (Section 6.12.6 ) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study patient presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic 
reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes, but is not limited to, the event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study drug (assessed only by [CONTACT_26563] a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. Action taken regarding study medication (e.g., drug withdrawn, interrupted ) will 
also be collected in the eCRF. All AEs that start during the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All treatment-related AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation will be followed to an adequate resolution,  as determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient is screened will be 
considered as medical history and not reported as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of severity to be performed. The AEs characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

All SAEs should be reported after the patient signs the informed consent and followed until 
resolution, stabilization,  or until the In vestigator provides su fficient evidence th at no fu rther 
information can be obta ined. 
All SAEs and pregnancies (in a patient or partner of a male patient) occurring while the 
patient is on the study or within 30 (±3) days after the patient received the last dose of study 
drug must be reported within 24 hours of the knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_145415]. 
Deaths that occur ≥30 (±3) days after the patient’s last study dose must be reported within

of the pregnancy) for data transmission purposes. In the event that a pregnancy complication 
occurs,  or elective termination of a pregnancy is required for medical reasons, then the 
complication will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. 
While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for medical reasons does not 
constitute an AE or SAE (even if the patient or patient’s partner is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145370]), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be reported as an AE 
and SAE,  as appropriate. 
Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study in a female patient 
should be reported using Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event by [CONTACT_3462]. Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy will be followed for 
outcome. 
If the patient has received the investigational drug prior to becoming pregnant, the patien t 
will continue the efficacy assessment and Follow-up periods and measures of safety and 
efficacy will be obtained. 
The patient will be follo wed until the outcome of the pregnancy is det ermined.  It is the 
responsibility of the In vestigator to obtain and document pregn ancy info rmation on the most

CONFIDENTIAL 6.12.2 Severity 
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows: 
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s 
daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that  persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alternatively, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE. 
6.12.3 Relationship 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For 
purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing causality are provided below: 
CNSA-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345])                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence  exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by [CONTACT_145416].  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study drug; 
related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or patient’s 
clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the  event did not occur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the trial medication) and in  which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying dise ase provides plausible explanations (e.g., the  patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of  the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event 
(e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an 
AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be 
flagged as requiring mor e information and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnorm al laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, 
and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallen ge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an 
abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug 
administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19010]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should 
be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmac ologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided,  if available.  
6.12.4 Expectedness 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
CNSA-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345])                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL or, if an Investigators’ Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol. 
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the 
study agent (e.g., Investigators’ Brochure). 
6.12.5 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated 
with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention, as determined by [CONTACT_3786]. However, each laboratory abnormality (e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel, urinalysis, urine microscopic, and HbA1c 
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or 
surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be 
recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clinical 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the 
individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal 
test assessments (e.g., vital signs) performed that are associated with signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described 
below. 
6.12.6 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition 
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life-threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

CONFIDENTIAL [IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse reaction to study 
treatment tha
t is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3  of the definitions: 
 Suspected adverse reaction 
 Serious 
 Unexpected 
If the AE does not meet all 3  of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within [ADDRESS_166304] include sufficient information on the 
SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should include at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug, and Investigator signature. 
The designated drug safety team will acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via email to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow-up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145371]) to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for 
closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_737]. 
The Inv estigator is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in acco rdance with institutional policie s and pro cedures including relevant initia l and 
follow-up info rmation about the SAE. 
Treatment-related SAEs or events leading to discontinuation of study drug will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested by [CONTACT_145417] (or designee) and should be provided 
as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_145418]-related.

All prescription and over-the-counter medications (including herbal medications) taken by a 
patient starting from the 30-day period before Screening through Day 28 (±1 d ay) before the 
patient leaves the clinic after completion of all EOS evaluations will be recorded. Any 
concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study will be recorded at each 
visit. 
6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug 
6.14.1 Early Discontinuation From Study Drug Administration 
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of 
study drug for an individual patient before the required full course of study drug is 
completed. Reasons for premature discontinuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the 
following: 
 Occurrence of an  AE, SAE, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], warrants the patient’s p ermanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration 
 In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administration 
 There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administrati on 
 Pregnancy 
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pregnancy or nursing during the study drug 
administration period occur. 
Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug due to any of the above reasons will 
complete the EOT assessments within 24 hours of withdrawal.

appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are 
not limited to: 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• AEs or SAEs  
• Significant patient noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the protocol 
requirements 
• The Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to withdraw from 
study participation, due to a reason other than safety 
Each patient who withdraws from the study after receipt of any amount of study drug will be 
asked to undergo EOT a
ssessments. However, patients may withdraw consent to participate 
in this study at 
any time without penalty. Withdrawn patients who receive any amount of 
study drug, will not be replaced. Withdrawn p atients who do not receive any study drug will 
be replaced. 
6.14.3 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_145372] (GCP) that 
compromise the ability to achieve the study objectives or compromise patient safety are 
observed at any time during the study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily 
suspended or terminated should the Investigator, Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of 
patients is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or permanent study hold 
will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled 
patients to date. In a temporary study hold, no additional patients will be enrolled into the 
study or dosed with study drug until the study team members (including the Investigator and 
the Medical Monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study.  
6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements 
Safety will be measured by [CONTACT_2695] (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory and HbA1c tests.  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutrient satiety test ( Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study.  Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography 
(Undeland et al,  1998 ), single-photon emission computed tomography ( Bredenoord et al, 
2003), and barostat testing ( Coulie et al, 1998 ; Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) . Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible (Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible (Kindt et 
CNSA-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345])                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL al, 2008 ) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity ( Tack et al, 2003 ). 
The GEBT is nonradioactive,  noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy. It has been accepted  by [CONTACT_86927] (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of 
gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying 
(gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can 
determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized meal with a 13C-labeled egg 
component by [CONTACT_145419] 13CO 2 to carbon-12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By [CONTACT_145420] 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by [CONTACT_145421]-emitting compounds (Section 6.10).  
The GCSI ( Section 6.8, Appendix 2 ), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI-SYM 
instrumen t (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and 
validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7 clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF-36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, 
and both clinicians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis-related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test-
re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician-
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found 
between the GCSI scores and SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symptom severity, as rated by 
[CONTACT_15098], reported greater symptom severity on the GCSI. The GCSI total scores were 
responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_15098] 
(p = 0.0002) and patients (p = 0.002) ( Revicki et al, 2003 ). 
The PAGI-SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI symptom severity 
instrument with 6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, 
patients with GERD (n = 810), dyspepsia (n = 767), or gastroparesis (n = 169) from the US, 
[LOCATION_009], Ge
rmany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI-SYM, the SF-36 
Health Survey, a disease-specific health-related quality of life measure (Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes
tinal Disorders-Quality of Life [PAGI-QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two-week reproducibility was evaluated in [ADDRESS_166308] reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI-SYM subscales. The 
PAGI-SYM subscale scores correlated significantly with SF-36 scores (all p <0.0001),

10.10 Data Generation and Analysis 
Some or all of the obligations of implementing or conducting this study may be transferred 
from Censa Pharmaceuticals to the CRO.  
A case report, comprised of individual eCRFs, will be completed for every patient who signs 
an ICF and is enrolled into the study. 
All original source documentation (laboratory results, treatment records, audit query 
responses, etc.) will be retained by [CONTACT_145432]. The results as they become available will be entered on the appropriate 
eCRFs. Legible reproductions of the original laboratory reports for selected tests or variables 
will be submitted to Censa Pharmaceuticals or CRO as requested. 
The eCRFs will be reviewed by a clinical monitor who will evaluate the completeness and 
accuracy of the data. Queries will be generated for omissions, corrections, and clarifications. 
Data may also be reviewed in-house by a clinical auditor and data management or other 
personnel. 
Data analyses will be performed after database lock, when all queries have been resolved.

microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid, and colorant 
(Yellow No. 6) that is suspended in Medisca® Oral Mix.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Patients will be treated for a total of 14 days.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of CNSA -001 as measured by [CONTACT_145398]- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), including assessment of severity of TEAEs, and changes in clinical 
laboratory  and HbA1c  tests, vital signs, and physical examinations  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the  change in maximal tolerated volume consumed during 
the nutrient satiety test from Day [ADDRESS_166362] of changes in the following from baseline to Day  14 and 
baseline to Day 28 (± 1 day):  
• GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2) PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale 
(heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal 
pain, and lower abdominal pain) scores 
• Gastric emptying as measured by [CONTACT_145399]:  
The following study populations will be analyzed: 
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) 
• Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study drug (CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available Day  [ADDRESS_166363] 
maximum tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®). The number and percentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and treatment group . Severity 
of AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal 
physical examination results will be provided. 
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The changes from Day [ADDRESS_166364] will be 
compared between treatment groups using a student’s t- test. Results from the nutrient satiety test 
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29, and the GC SI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9 , Appendix 2
) through Day  14 (+1) and 
through Day  28 (± 1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and ra nge) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group. The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided. 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis pla n.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis   
Gastroparesis is characterized by [CONTACT_145435]; symptoms are chronic with epi[INVESTIGATOR_145356] ( Parkman et al,  
2004).  Gastroparesis affects women 4 times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998).  Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accounts for most cases , but gastroparesis is frequently associated with diabetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis)  (Soykan, et al,  1998; Karamanolis  et al, 2007). Several 
cross -sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30% 
to 50% of patients wi th Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes ( Horowitz et al, 2002). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction  (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis ( Stacher , 
2001; Parkman  et al,  2004). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri et al , 2013).  
At a molecular level,  attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by [CONTACT_145401] ( Wood et al, 1999). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric ox ide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter in the regulatio n of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003) ; it is the principal non adrenergic 
noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the GI tract . In diabetic rats , which serve as a 
model for type 1 diabetes, nNOS expression was found to be impaired. This impairment in nNOS messenger RN A expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the proximal stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997).  It has been demonstrated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats , female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls , and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabetic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats  
(Gangula et al, 2007). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis by [CONTACT_145402] (92 % to 96% ), 
vomiting (68% to 88%), postprandial fullness (54% to 77% ), early satiety (42 % to 60%), and 
upper abdominal pain (36% to 85% ) (Soykan et al,  1998; Hoogerwerf  et al , 1999; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009). Patients may experience an y combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of severity. Pain is less prevalent  in diabetic gastroparesis  than  idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic  gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose cont rol because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may , in turn , affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition,

with the disease, resulting in d ecreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression ( Soykan et al, 1998; Parkman et al , 2004).

especially in the postprandial state, and impairment o f the postprandial accommodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008).  The stomach functions as 2 separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure, 
and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. Receptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated result ing in the release of NO and activation of nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation and pylor ic 
relaxation in response to a meal  (Ishiguchi et al, 2001).  
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis ( Karamanolis et al, 2007). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a nutrient meal ( Kumar et al, 2008). In the distal stomach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that triturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closu re; lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation  (Gangula et al, 2007). 
Several co -factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ( NADPH) , calcium , and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
(Werner et al, 2003).  The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS ) is regulated by  [CONTACT_8060]4  (Werner et al, 2003). In the absence of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in further impaired nNOS bioactivity.

There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline symptom severity

patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despi[INVESTIGATOR_145359]-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination prokinetic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric

Study GAS -001 is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_145364]-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) powder for suspension administered orally in 
women with moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis. This is an out patient  study in which 
up to 20 patients will be enrolled at approximately  4 centers . 
The Schedule of Events is provided in Appendix 1. The study schema is displayed in Figure  
1.  
Screening Period (Day -28 Through Day  1 Predose)  
An informed consent form (ICF) must be signed before any study- related procedures are 
performed. After providing consent, patients will undergo Screening procedures to determine 
study eligibility, as indicated in Appendix 1. Pa tients who are eligible based on Screening 
evaluations will undergo baseline evaluations before initiation of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) , be randomized, and proceed to the Treatment Period.  
Treatment Period ( Day 1 Through Day  14) 
Following the Scree ning Period and completion of baseline evaluations , all randomized 
patients will take their  first dose of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) o n Day 1 while in the 
clinic.  Patients will undergo procedures during the Treatment Period as indicated in 
Appendix 1. 
Study drug may be prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, as described in 
Section  6.14.1. Patients may also withdraw  from the study for any reason, as described in 
Section  6.14.2. If a patien t discontinues study drug early, the patient should return to the 
study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the End of Treatment (EOT) (Section 7.5, Appendix 1). If a patient  withdraws early from the 
study before undergoing EOT evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EOT 
(Section 7.5, Appendix 1). If a patient withdraws from the study before undergoing End of 
Study (EOS) evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site within  24 hours 
of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EO S (Section 7.6, 
Appendix 1).   
End of Tr eatment Period (Day 14 Through Day  15 Evaluations) 
Patients will undergo EOT evaluations on Day  [ADDRESS_166391] 
(Section 6.7) on Day  14. The GCSI ( Section 6.8, Appendix 2) and PAGI- SYM (Section 6.9,

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
CNSA-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH [ADDRESS_166394] . Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by [CONTACT_145437][INVESTIGATOR_145365]4. It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA -001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH 4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired ( Xu et al, 2007).  
CNSA-001 was studied in two 14-day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies, as described in Section 5.3, and in a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU-001, as described in Section 1.5.

their assigned study drug, the study design of a randomized study of CNSA-001 versus

C9H11 N5O3. Inactive ingredients in CNSA-001 include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, and ascorbic acid. CNSA-001 will be suspended in Medisca® 
Oral Mix prior to dispensing it to the patient.  
5.1.2 Placebo  Control 
The placebo is a ready -made suspension containing microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid , and colorant (Yellow No. 6) that is suspended 
in Medisca® Oral Mix.   
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1  to the following treatment groups :  
• CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day  (10 mg/kg BID) for 14 days 
• Placebo BID for 14 days 
Dosing of CNSA-001 is  based on the patient’s weight . The weight obtained on Day  -[ADDRESS_166402]  amount ( mg) of CNSA -001 active ingredient  (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345] )

This study has a double-blind design. The Investigator , study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study drug is being received.  Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site ) personnel will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug. 
Patients will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential f or the clinical management or welfare of a specific patient , may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_145380] . If emergency 
unblinding is required, the Investigator will have immediate access to individual sealed  codes 
containing treatment allocation s. However , before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate 
Sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible and without revealing the patient ’s study drug 
assignment (unless important to the safety of patients remaining in the study), the Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and t he Investigator 
was unable to contact [CONTACT_145409]. The Investigator will record in source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for any patient  and the names  and roles of personnel unblinded .

The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) (Section 6.12.6) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study patient presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate e CRF. 
Information to be collected includes, but is  not limited to, the  event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study dru g (assessed only by [CONTACT_26563] a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. Action taken regarding study medication (e.g., drug withdrawn, interrupted) will 
also be collected in the eCRF. All AEs that start during the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All treatment -related AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation will be followed to an adequate resolution, as determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Any medical condition that is pre sent at the time that the patient is screened  will be 
considered as medical history  and not reported as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. The AEs characterized as intermittent

occurs , or elective termination of a pregnancy is required for medical reasons, then the 
complication will be record ed as an AE or SAE , as appropriate.  
While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for medical reasons does not constitute an AE  or SAE (even if the patient  or patient’ s partner is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145370]), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be reported as an AE

CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.2 Severity  
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that  persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alternatively, a stroke that  results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE. 
6.12.3 Relationship  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing c ausality are provided  below:

AMENDMENT 1: [ADDRESS_166428] 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by [CONTACT_145416].  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or 
patient’s clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in  
which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of  the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnorm al laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallen ge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmac ologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided, if available . 
6.12.4 Expectedness  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected ” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed;

CONFIDENTIAL  or, if an Investigators’ Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol. 
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent ( e.g., Investigators’ Brochure). 
6.12.5 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention, as determined by [CONTACT_3786]. However, each laboratory abnormality ( e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel , urinalysis, urine microscopic, and HbA1c  
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clini cal 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments ( e.g., vital signs ) performed that are associated w ith signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described below. 
6.12.6 Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition  
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life -threatening AE, inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life- threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriat e medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judg ment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse reaction to study 
treatment that is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3 of the definitions: 
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious 
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all 3 of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within [ADDRESS_166431] include sufficient information on the SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should incl ude at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug , and I nvestigator signature . 
The designated drug safety team will acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via email to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow -up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145371]) to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_737]. 
The Inve stigator is responsible for in forming  the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in accordance with institution al policie s and procedure s including re levant initia l and

6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug  
6.14.1 Early Discontinuation From Study Drug Administration  
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of study drug for an individual patient before the required full course of study drug is 
completed.  Reasons for premature discontinuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the following: 
• Occurrence of an AE, SAE,  or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], warrants the patient’s permanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration  
• In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administr ation  
• There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administration  
• Pregnancy  
• Specific reasons related  to adverse events that have been observed in pre- and post-
marketing treatment with the same drug class of  CNSA-001 (i.e., sapropterin): 
o Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
o Gastritis  
o Abnormal liver function tests in patients with liver impairment  
o Unexplained hyperactivity  
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of childbearing pote ntial at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pregnancy or nurs ing during the  study drug 
administration period occur.

compromise the ability to achieve the study objectives or compromise patient  safety are 
observed at any time during the study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily suspended or terminated should the Investigator, Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of 
patients  is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or permanent study hold 
will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled patients to date. For example, the study will be temporarily  or permanently halted should 
either of the following occur:

CONFIDENTIAL  In a temporary study hold, no additional patients will be enrolled into the study or dosed with 
study drug until the study team members (including the Investigator and the Medical 
Monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study. 
  6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Safety will be measured by [CONTACT_2695] (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinic al laboratory and HbA1c tests .  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study. Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography 
(Undeland et al , 1998), single-photon emission computed tomography ( Bredenoord et al, 
2003), and barostat testing ( Coulie et al, 1998; Sarnelli et al, 2001).  Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible ( Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible ( Kindt et 
al, 2008) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity  (Tack et al, 2003).  
The GEBT is nonradioactive, noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy . It has been accepted by [CONTACT_86927] (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized  meal with a 
13C-labeled egg 
component by [CONTACT_145419] 13CO 2 to carbon -12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By [CONTACT_145420] 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by [CONTACT_145442] r elated to radiation -emitting compounds ( Section 6.10).  
The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI- SYM 
instrument (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7  clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF -36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, and both clini cians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis -related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test-re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician -
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found between the GCSI scores and SF -36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symp tom severity, as rated by 
[CONTACT_145443] -001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345])                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_15098] (p = 0.0002) and patients (p = 0.002) ( Revicki et al, 2003). 
The PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) is a 20-item upper GI  symptom severity 
instrument with 6  subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, patients with GERD (n  = 810), dyspepsia (n = 767), or g astroparesis (n  = 169) from the US, 
[LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI-SYM, the SF-36 Health Su rvey, a disease- specific health -related quality of life  measure ( Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes tinal Disorders -Quality of Life [PAGI -QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two-week reproducibility was evaluated in [ADDRESS_166438] reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI- SYM subscales. The 
PAGI -SYM subscale scores correlated significantly with SF -36 scores (all p <0.0001), 
PAGI -QOL scores (all p <0.0001), disability days (p <0.0001), and global symptom severity 
(p <0.0001). Mean PAGI-SYM scores varied significantly in groups defined by [CONTACT_145444] (all p <0.0001), in which greater symptom severity was associated with more disability days ( Rentz et al, 2004; Revicki et al, 2004).

AMENDMENT 2: [ADDRESS_166495] is placebo . The placebo is a ready -made suspension containing 
microcrystalline cellul ose, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid, and colorant 
(Yellow No. 6) that is suspended in Medisca® Oral Mix.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Patients will be treated for a total of 14 days.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of CNSA -001 as measured by [CONTACT_145398] -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), including assessment of severity of TEAEs, and changes in clinical 
laboratory  and HbA1c  tests, vital signs, and physical examinations  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the  change in maximal tolerated volume consumed during 
the nutrient satiety test from Day [ADDRESS_166496] of changes in the following from baseline to  Day 14 and 
baseline to Day 28 (±1 day):  
• GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale  
(heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal 
pain, and lower abdominal pain) scores  
• Gastric emptying as measured by [CONTACT_145399]:  
The following study populations will be analyzed:  
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo ) 
• Efficacy populati on: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study drug 
(CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available  Day [ADDRESS_166497] 
maximum tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population . Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and percentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and treatment group . Severity 
of AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table 
or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal 
physical examination results will be provided.  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The change s from Day [ADDRESS_166498] will be 
compared between treatment groups using a student’s t -test. Results from the nutrient satiety test  
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29,  and the  GCSI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) through Day 14 (+1) and 
through Day 28 (±1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group . The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided . 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis pla n.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis   
Gastroparesis is characterized by [CONTACT_145435]; symptoms are c hronic with epi[INVESTIGATOR_145356] ( Parkman et al,  
2004 ). Gastroparesis affects wo men 4 times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998 ). Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accou nts for most cases , but gastroparesis is frequently associated with di abetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis)  (Soykan, et al,  1998 ; Karamanolis  et al, 2007 ). Several 
cross -sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30 % 
to 50% of patients wi th Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (Horowitz et al, 2002 ). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction  (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983 ).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic ga stroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have a ll been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis  (Stacher , 
2001 ; Parkman  et al,  2004 ). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri  et al, 2013).  
At a molecular level,  attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by [CONTACT_145453] ( Wood et al, 1999 ). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric oxide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter 
in the regulatio n of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003 ); it is the principal non adrenergic 
noncholiner gic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the  GI tract. In diabetic rats , which serve a s a 
model for type 1 diabetes, n NOS expression was found to be impaired . This impairment in 
nNOS messenger RNA  expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the pro ximal 
stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997 ). It has been demonst rated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats , female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls , and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabe tic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats  
(Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis  by [CONTACT_145454] (92 % to 96 %), 
vomiting (68 % to 88 %), postprandial fullness (54 % to 77 %), early sat iety (42 % to 60 %), and 
upper abdominal pain (36 % to 85 %) (Soykan et al,  1998 ; Hoogerwerf  et al, 1999 ; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009 ). Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of s everity. Pain is less prevalent  in diabetic gastroparesis  than idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic  gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose cont rol because of unpred ictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which  may, in turn , affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe  signs and symptoms may cause  complications such as malnutrition,

with the disease, resulting in d ecreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression (Soykan et al, 1998 ; Parkman et al , 2004 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_166510] gastric hypersensitivity, 
especially in the postprandial state, and impairment of the postprandial ac commodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008 ). The stomach functions as 2  separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure , 
and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. R eceptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated result ing in the release of NO and activation o f nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation  and pyloric 
relaxation in response to a meal  (Ishiguchi et al, 2001 ). 
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss 
in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis  (Karamanolis et al, 2007 ). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a 
nutrient meal  (Kumar et al, 2008 ). In the distal stom ach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that triturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closu re; lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation  (Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
Several co -factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ( NADPH ), calcium , and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)  
(Werner et al, 2003 ). The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS ) is regulated by  [CONTACT_8060]4  (Werner et al, 2003 ). In the absence  of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in  further impaired 
nNOS bioactivity.

There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline  symptom severity

The first -line medical therapy for patients with diabetic gastroparesis  is generally a 
combination of an antiemetic agent in addition to the  promotility drug. Unfortunately, many 
patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despi[INVESTIGATOR_145359]-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination prokinetic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric

effect]). Additionally, K uvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) , a synthetic BH4 commercially 
available product , was administered at equivalent doses for the first 3 dose levels (2.5 mg/kg, 
7.5 mg/kg , and 20 mg/kg). Dose -dependent correlations between CNSA -001 and plasma 
BH4 concentr ations were observed with each successive dose level. Dose proportionality was 
observed between the top 2 dose levels (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) and resultant BH4 
concentrations. Administration with a standard high -fat (approximately 50 percent of total 
caloric content of the meal) and high calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal 
resulted in approximat ely 80% higher plasma BH4 concentrations ( area under the

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
Study  GAS -001 is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_145364] -001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) powder for suspension administered orally in 
women with moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis. This is an out patient  study in which 
up to 20 patients will be enrolled at approximately  4 centers . 
The Schedule of Events is provided in Appendix  1. The study schema is displayed in Figure  
1.  
Screening Period (Day -28 Through Day 1 Predose)  
An informed consent form (ICF) must be signed before any study -related procedures are 
performed. After providing consent, patients will unde rgo Screening procedures to determine 
study eligibility, as indicated in Appendix  1. Patients who are eligible based on Screening 
evaluations will undergo baseline evaluations before initiation of study drug (CNSA -001 or 
placeb o), be randomized,  and proceed to the Treatment Period.  
Treatment Period ( Day 1 Through Day 14) 
Following the Screening Period  and completion of baseline evaluations , all randomized 
patients will take their  first dose of study drug (CNSA -001 or placebo ) on Day 1 while in the 
clinic.  Patients will undergo procedures during the Treatment Period as indicated in 
Appendix  1. 
Study drug may be prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, as described in 
Section  6.14.1 . Patients may also withdraw  from the study for any reason, as described in 
Section  6.14.2 . If a patien t discontinues study drug early , the patient should return to the 
study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the 
End of Treatment (EOT) (Section 7.5, Appendix  1). If a patient  withdraws early from the 
study  before undergoing EOT evaluations , the patient will be asked to return to the study site 
within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EOT 
(Section 7.5, Appendix  1). If a patient withdraws from the study before undergoing End of 
Study (EOS) evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site within 24  hours 
of withdrawal and complete all of the procedur es outlined for the EO S (Section 7.6, 
Appendix  1).  
End of Treatment Period (Day 14 Through Day 15 Evaluations)

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
CNSA -001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH [ADDRESS_166521] . Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by [CONTACT_145457] e rapid intracellular conversion of sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145365] 4. It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA -001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis  will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH 4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired (Xu et al, 2007 ). 
CNSA -001 was studied in two 14 -day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies , as 
described in Section 5.3, and in  a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU -001, as described in Section 1.5.  
Because a ll patients will receive the standard of care for diabetic gastroparesis  in addition to 
their assigned study drug, t he study design of a randomized  study  of CNSA -001 versus 

CNSA -001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345])                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

5.5 Blinding  
This study has a double -blind design.  The Investigator , study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study d rug is being received.  Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site ) personnel  will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug.  
Patients will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential f or the clinical management or welfare of a specific patient , may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_145387] . If emergency 
unblinding is requ ired, the Investigator will have immedi ate access to individual sealed  codes 
containing treatment allocation s. However , before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate

CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.2  Severity  
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between seri ous and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alt ernatively, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE.  
6.12.3  Relationship  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For 
purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing causality are provided  below :

AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence  exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or 
patient’s clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, wh ose 
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the  event did not occur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the trial medication) and in  which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying disease provid es plausible explanations (e.g., the  patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial  
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event 
(e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be 
flagged as requiring more informat ion and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, 
and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an 
abnormal laboratory test resul t, occurs in a plausible time relationship to 
drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) 
should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologi cally or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be  unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided , if available . 
6.12.4  Expectedness  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed;

AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  or, if an Investigators’ Brochure  is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol.  
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the 
study agent  (e.g., Investigators’ Brochure ). 
6.12.5  Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated 
with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention , as determined by [CONTACT_3786] . However, each laboratory abnormality ( e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel , urinalysis, urine microscopic , and HbA1c  
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or 
surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be 
recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clini cal 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the 
individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal 
test assessments ( e.g., vital signs ) performed that are associated w ith signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described 
below.  
6.12.6  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition  
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life -threatening AE, in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ab ility to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be li fe-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Ex amples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  Medical and scientific judg ment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse r eaction to study 
treatment that is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3 of the definitions:  
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all 3 of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within [ADDRESS_166547] include sufficient information on the 
SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should include at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug , and Investigator signature . 
The designated drug safety team will  acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via e mail to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow -up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145371])  to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for 
closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_737].  
The Investigator is responsible  for informing  the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in accordance with institution al policies and procedures including relevant initi al and 
follow -up in formation about the  SAE. 
Treatment -related SAEs or events leading to discontinuation of study drug will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested by [CONTACT_145417] (or designee ) and should be provided 
as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_145418] -related.

CONFIDENTIAL  All SAEs through Day 44 ±3 days [30 ±[ADDRESS_166549] dose of study 
drug] will be recorded in the eCRF  and reported as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
6.13 Prior and Concomitant Medication Assessments  
All prescription and over -the-counter medications (including herbal medications) taken by a 
patient starting from the 30 -day period before Screening through Day 28 (±1 day) before the 
patient leaves the clinic after completion of all EOS evaluations will be recorded. Any 
concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study will be recorded at each 
visit.  
6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug  
6.14.1  Early Disco ntinuation From Study Drug Administration  
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of 
study drug for an individual patient before the required full cou rse of study drug is 
completed.  Reasons for premature dis continuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the 
following:  
• Occurrence of a n AE, SAE,  or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], warrants the patient’s permanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration  
• In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administr ation  
• There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administrati on 
• Pregnancy  
• Specific  reasons related  to adverse events that have been observed in pre - and post -
marketing treatment with the sam e drug class of CNSA -001 (i.e., sapropterin):  
o Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
o Gastritis  
o Abnormal liver function tests in patients with liver impairment  
o Unexplained hyperactivity  
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of ch ildbearing potential at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pr egnancy or nursing during the  study drug 
administration period occur.

Investigator or Sponsor. The reason for a patient ’s withdrawal must be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are 
not limited to:  
• Withdrawal of consent   
• AEs or SAEs  
• Significant patient  noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the protocol 
requirements  
• The Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to withdraw from 
study participation, due to a reason other than safety  
Each patient who withdraws from the study after receipt of any amount of study drug will be 
asked to undergo EOT  assessments. However, patients may withdraw consent to participate 
in this study at any time w ithout penalty.  Withdrawn patients  who receive any amount  of 
study drug,  will not be replaced.  Withdrawn p atients who do not receive any study drug will 
be replaced.  
6.14.3  Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_145388] ( GCP ) that 
compromise the ability to achieve the study objectives or compromise patient  safety are 
observed at any time during the study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily 
suspended or terminated should the Investigator,  Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of 
patients  is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or permanent study hold 
will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled 
patients to date. For exa mple, the study will be temporarily or permanently halted should 
either of the following occur:  
• The presence of the same system organ class (e,g., gastrointestinal, cardiac , etc. ) 
severe  AE for which no other alternative etiology can be identified, conside red 
related to study drug, in 2 or more patients  (Severity defined in Section 6.12.2 ). 
• The presence of life -threatening AE or AE requiring urgent intervention in 1 or more 
patients.  
• Death related to Adverse Event.

6.15 Appropriateness of M easurements  
Safety will be measured by [CONTACT_2695] (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory and HbA1c  tests.  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study . Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography  
(Undeland et al , 1998 ), single -photon emission computed tomography (Bredenoord et al, 
2003 ), and barostat testing  (Coulie et al, 1998 ; Sarnelli et  al, 2001 ). Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible  (Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible  (Kindt et 
al, 2008 ) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity  (Tack et al, 2003 ). 
The GEBT  is nonradioactive,  noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy . It has been  accepte d by [CONTACT_86927] (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of 
gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of del ayed gastric emptying 
(gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can 
determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized  meal with a 13C-labeled egg 
component by [CONTACT_145419] 13CO 2 to carbon -12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By [CONTACT_145420] 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by [CONTACT_145458] s related to radiation -emitting compounds  (Section 6.10).  
The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI -SYM 
instrumen t (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and 
validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7  clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF -36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, 
and both clini cians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis -related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test -
re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician -
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found 
between the GCSI scores and SF -36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symp tom severity, as rated by 
[CONTACT_145443] -001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345])                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_15098] 
(p = 0.0002) and patients (p  = 0.002) ( Revicki et al, 2003 ). 
The PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI symptom severity 
instrument  with 6  subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper  abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, 
patients with GERD (n  = 810), dyspepsia (n  = 767), or g astroparesis (n  = 169) from the US, 
[LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI -SYM, the SF -36 
Health Su rvey, a disease -specific health -related quality of life  measure ( Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes tinal Disorders -Quality of Life [PAGI -QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two -week reproducibility was evaluated in [ADDRESS_166551] reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI -SYM subscales. The 
PAGI -SYM subscale scores correlated significa ntly with SF -36 scores (all p < 0.0001), 
PAGI -QOL scores (all p <0.0001), disability days (p  <0.0001), and global symptom severity 
(p <0.0001). Mean PAGI -SYM scores varied significantly in groups d efined by [CONTACT_145422] (all p <0.0001), in which greater symptom severity was associated with more disability 
days (Rentz et al, 2004 ; Revicki et al, 2004 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 3  (FEBRUARY 21, 2019) 
Protocol GAS -001 is amended primarily for the following reasons: 
1. Modified Inclusion Criterion # 2 to increase the upper age limit from 65 to 75 years. 
2. Modified Inclusion Criterion #[ADDRESS_166596] historical GES or GEBT greater than 2 years 
prior to enrollment.  Consistent with FDA draft guidance, either GES or GEBT may be used to confirm delayed gastric emptying.  
3. Modified Exclusion Criterion #9 to state the method of QT correction required.  
Fridericia’s correction is being applied to ensure consistency across Censa sponsored clinical studies.  
Major changes to the protocol are as follows: 
Synopsis, Section 4.2 and Appendix 1: Modified exclusion criteria #2 and #4 to increase the 
upper age limit from 65 to 75 and to permit testing for gastric emptying with either the GES 
or the GEBT during screening, respectively. 
Synopsis and Section 4.3: Modified exclusion criterion #9 to clarify that QTc will be

Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of CNSA -001 as measured by [CONTACT_145398]- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), including assessment of severity of TEAEs, and changes in clinical 
laboratory  and HbA1c  tests, vital signs, and physical examination s 
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the  change in maximal tolerated volume consumed during 
the nutrient satiety test from Day [ADDRESS_166607] of changes in the following from baseline to  Day  14 and 
baseline to Day 28 (± 1 day):  
• GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2) PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale 
(heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal 
pain, and lower abdominal  pain) scores 
• Gastric emptying as measured by [CONTACT_145399]:  
The following study populations will be analyzed: 
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) 
• Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study drug 
(CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available Day  [ADDRESS_166608] 
maximum tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and percentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and treatment group . Severity 
of AEs and serious adverse events ( SAE s) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal 
physical examination results will be provided. 
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The changes from Day [ADDRESS_166609] will be 
compared between treatment groups using a student’s t- test. Results from the nutrient satiety test 
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29, and the G CSI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9 , Appendix 2
) through Day  14 (+1) and 
through Day  28 (± 1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and ra nge) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group. The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided. 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis pla n.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis   
Gastroparesis is characterized by [CONTACT_145435]; symptoms are chronic with epi[INVESTIGATOR_145356] ( Parkman et al,  
2004).  Gastroparesis affects women 4 times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998).  Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accounts for most cases , but gastroparesis is frequently associated with diabetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis)  (Soykan, et al,  1998; Karamanolis  et al, 2007). Several 
cross -sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30% 
to 50% of patients wi th Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes ( Horowitz et al, 2002). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction  (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis ( Stacher , 
2001; Parkman  et al,  2004). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri et al , 2013).  
At a molecular level,  attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by [CONTACT_145463] ( Wood et al, 1999). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric oxide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gas trointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter in the regulatio n of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003) ; it is the principal non adrenergic 
noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the GI tract . In diabetic rats , which serve as a 
model for type 1 diabetes, nNOS expression was found to be impaired. This impairment in nNOS messenger RNA  expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the proximal stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997).  It has been demonstrated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats , female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls , and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabetic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats  
(Gangula et al, 2007). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis by [CONTACT_145402] (92 % to 96% ), 
vomiting (68% to 88%), postprandial fullness (54% to 77% ), early satiety (42 % to 60%), and 
upper abdominal pain (36% to 85% ) (Soykan et al,  1998; Hoogerwerf  et al , 1999; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009). Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of s everity. Pain is less p revalent  in diabetic gastroparesis  than  idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic  gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose cont rol because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may , in turn , affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition,

with the disease, resulting in d ecreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression ( Soykan et al, 1998; Parkman et al , 2004).  
1.[ADDRESS_166621] gastric hypersensitivity, 
especially in the postprandial state, and impairment of the postprandial accommodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008).  The stomach functions as 2 separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure, and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. Receptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated result ing in the release of NO and activation of nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation and pyloric relaxation in response to a meal  (Ishiguchi et al, 2001).  
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis ( Karamanolis et al, 2007). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a nutrient meal ( Kumar et al, 2008). In the distal stomach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that tr iturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closure;  lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation  (Gangula et al, 2007). 
Several co -factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ( NADPH) , calcium , and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
(Werner et al, 2003).  The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS ) is regulated by [CONTACT_8060]4  (Werner et al, 2003). In the absence of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in further impaired nNOS bioactivity.

There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline symptom severity

patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despi[INVESTIGATOR_145359]-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination proki netic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric 
stimulation  (Fass, 2010; Camilleri et al , 2013).

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
CNSA-001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH [ADDRESS_166633] . Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by [CONTACT_145457] e rapid intracellular conversion of sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145365]4. It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA -001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH 4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired ( Xu et al, 2007).  
CNSA-001 was studied in two 14-day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies, as described in Section 5.3, and in a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU-001, as described in Section 1.5.

the new chemical entity, sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345]. Sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145378] 2-amino -6-[(2S)-2-hydroxypropanoyl]-
7,8-dihydro-1H- pteridin -4-one with a molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of 
C9H11 N5O3. Inactive ingredients in CNSA-001 include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, and ascorbic acid. CNSA-001 will be suspended in Medisca® 
Oral Mix prior to dispensing it to the patient.  
5.1.2 Placebo  Control 
The placebo is a ready -made suspension containing microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid , and colorant (Yellow No. 6) that is suspended 
in Medisca® Oral Mix.   
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1  to the following treatment groups :  
• CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day  (10 mg/kg BID) for 14 days 
• Placebo BID for 14 days 
Dosing of CNSA-001 is  based on the patient’s weight . The weight obtained on Day  -[ADDRESS_166639] amount ( mg) of CNSA -001 active ingredient  (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345] ) 
required for each patient’s daily dose.  
The placebo  is formulated as ready -made suspension. The placebo will be administered in the 
same manner (volume) as CNSA-001. 
Details on preparation of study drug and dosing guidelines will be provided in a pharmacy manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients .  
5.3 Selection and Timing  of Dose for Each Patient  
All patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to receive CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day  
(10 mg/kg  BID)  or placebo BID .  
The CNSA-[ADDRESS_166640] level  from both studies was set at 
1000 mg/kg/day, which represents a human equivalent dose of 161.3 mg/kg/da y based on 
allometric scaling. Consequently, the proposed dose of 20 mg/kg/day represents a n 8.1-fold 
safety margin.

will record all doses taken and times they were taken  (Section  5.8.1). The first dose on Day  [ADDRESS_166641] ( Section 6.7). 
If a patient vomits after taking a dose of study drug, the patient should wai t until the next 
scheduled timepoint to take another dose. A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, 
but >2 doses should not be taken on the same day. 
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients  to Treatment Groups  
Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria  and provide informed consent will be randomized 
in a ratio of 1:1  to the CNSA-001 or placeb o group  via the randomization scheme generated 
for the study. Patients who are randomized will be considered to be enrolled.  5.5 Blinding  
This study has a double-blind design. The Investigator , study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study drug is being received.  Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site ) personnel will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug. 
Patients will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential for the clinic al management or welfare of a specific patient , may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_145380] . If emergency 
unblinding is required, the Investigator will have immediate access to individual sealed  codes 
containing treatment allocation s. However , before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate 
Sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible and without revealing the patient ’s study drug 
assignment (unless important to the safety of patients remaining in the study), the Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and the Investigat or 
was unable to contact [CONTACT_145409]. The Investigator will record in source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for any patient  and the names  and roles of personnel unblinded. 
5.6 Concomita nt Therapy  
Patients will be permitted to take:  
• Analgesics, including narcotics, if the patient has been on a stable dose of the medication for > 30 days before  randomization; dose escalation is NOT permitted 
during the study through the EOT  
• Promotility agent s, including metoclopramide  if the patient has been on a stable dose 
of the medication > 30 days before  randomization; dose changes are NOT  permitted

found in the patient’s breath is proportional to the patient’s rate of gastric emptying. The 
patient’s 13CO 2 excretion rate at each breath collection time is reported using the GEBT 
metric “kPCD.” The “k” is a multiplier of 1000, and “PCD” is an acronym for percent 13C

The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) (Section 6.12.6) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study patient presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate e CRF. 
Information to be collected includes, but is  not limited to, the  event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study dru g (assessed only by [CONTACT_26563] a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. Action taken regarding study medication (e.g., drug withdrawn, interrupted) will 
also be collected in the eCRF. All AEs that start during the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All treatment -related AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation will be followed to an adequate resolution, as determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
Any medical condition that is pre sent at the time that the patient is screened  will be 
considered as medical history  and not reported as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. The AEs characterized as intermittent

information can be obta ined. 
All SAEs and pregnancies (in a patient or partner of a male patient) occurring while the 
patient is on the study or within 30 (± 3) days after the patient received the last dose of study 
drug must be reported within 24 hours of the knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_145415].

[ADDRESS_166659] be processed following SAE  timelines (e.g., within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy) for data transmission purposes. In the event that a pregnancy complication 
occurs , or elective termination of a pregnancy is required for medical reasons, then the 
complication will be record ed as an AE or SAE , as appropriate.  
While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for medical reasons does not constitute an AE  or SAE (even if the patient  or patient’ s partner is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145370]), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be reported as an AE 
and SAE, as appropriate.  
Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study in a female patient should be reported using Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_3462]. Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy will be followed for outcome. 
If the patient has received the investigational drug prior to becoming pregnant, the patien t 
will continue the efficacy assessment and Follow-up periods and measures of safety and 
efficacy will be obtained.  
The patient will be  followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is determined. I t is the

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.2 Severity  
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that  persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alternatively, a stroke that  results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE. 
6.12.3 Relationship  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing c ausality are provided  below:

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by [CONTACT_145416].  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or 
patient’s clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in  
which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of  the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnorm al laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallen ge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacol ogically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to  be unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided, if available . 
6.12.4 Expectedness  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected ” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed;

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  or, if an Investigators’ Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol. 
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent ( e.g., Investigators’ Brochure). 
6.12.5 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention, as determined by [CONTACT_3786]. However, each laboratory abnormality ( e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel , urinalysis, urine microscopic, and HbA1c  
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clini cal 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments ( e.g., vital signs ) performed that are associated w ith signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described below. 
6.12.6 Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition  
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life -threatening AE, inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life- threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriat e medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judg ment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse reaction to study 
treatment that is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3 of the definitions: 
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious 
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all 3 of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within [ADDRESS_166660] include sufficient information on the SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should incl ude at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug , and I nvestigator signature . 
The designated drug safety team will acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via email to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow -up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_145371]) to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_737]. 
The Inve stigator is responsible for in forming  the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in accordance with institution al policie s and procedure s including re levant initia l and 
follow-up information about the S AE. 
Treatment -related SAEs or events leading to discontinuation of study drug will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested by [CONTACT_145417] (or designee) and should be provided 
as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_145441] -related.

concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study will be recorded at each visit.  
6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug  
6.14.1 Early Disco ntinuation From Study Drug Administration  
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of study drug for an individual patient before the required full course of study drug is 
completed.  Reasons for premature dis continuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the following: 
• Occurrence of an AE, SAE,  or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], warrants the patient’s permanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration  
• In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administration  
• There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administration  
• Pregnancy  
• Specific reasons related  to adverse events that have been observed in pre- and post-
marketing treatment with the same drug class of CNSA -001 (i.e., sapropterin): 
o Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
o Gastritis  
o Abnormal liver function tests in patients with liver impairment  
o Unexplained hyperactivity  
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pregnancy or nursing during the study drug administration period occur.

will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled patients to date. For example, the study will be temporarily or permanently halted should 
either of the following occur: 
• The presence of the same system organ class (e,g., gastrointestinal, cardiac, etc. ) 
severe AE for which no other alternative etiology can be identified, considered related to study drug, in 2 or more patients (Severity defined in Section 6.12.2). 
• The presence of life-threatening AE or AE requiring urgent intervention in 1 or more patients.  
• Death related to Adverse Event.

CONFIDENTIAL  In a temporary study hold, no additional patients will be enrolled into the study or dosed with 
study drug until the study team members (including the Investigator and the Medical 
Monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study. 
  6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Safety will be measured by [CONTACT_2695] (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory and HbA1c tests .  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutr ient satiety test (Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study. Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography 
(Undeland et al , 1998), single-photon emission computed tomography ( Bredenoord et al, 
2003), and barostat testing ( Coulie et al, 1998; Sarnelli  et al, 2001).  Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible ( Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible ( Kindt et 
al, 2008) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity  (Tack et al, 2003).  
The GEBT is nonradioactive, noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy . It has been accepted by [CONTACT_86927] (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized  meal with a 
13C-labeled egg 
component by [CONTACT_145419] 13CO 2 to carbon -12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By [CONTACT_145467] o f 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by [CONTACT_145468] -emitting compounds ( Section 6.10).  
The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI- SYM 
instrument (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7  clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF -36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, and both clini cians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis -related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test-re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician -
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found between the GCSI scores and SF -36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symp tom severity, as rated by 
[CONTACT_145443] -001 (sepi[INVESTIGATOR_145345])                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL  clinicians, reported greater symptom severity on the GCSI. The GCSI total scores were 
responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_15098] (p = 0.0002) and patients (p = 0.002) ( Revicki et al, 2003). 
The PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) is a 20-item upper GI  symptom severity 
instrument with 6  subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, patients with GERD (n  = 810), dyspepsia (n = 767), or g astroparesis (n  = 169) from the US, 
[LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI-SYM, the SF-36 Health Su rvey, a disease- specific health -related quality of life  measure ( Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes tinal Disorders -Quality of Life [PAGI -QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two-week reproducibility was evaluated in [ADDRESS_166664] reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI- SYM subscales. The 
PAGI -SYM subscale scores correlated significantly with SF -36 scores (all p <0.0001), 
PAGI -QOL scores (all p <0.0001), disability days (p <0.0001), and global symptom severity 
(p <0.0001). Mean PAGI-SYM scores varied significantly in groups defined by [CONTACT_145444] (all p <0.0001), in which greater symptom severity was associated with more disability days ( Rentz et al, 2004; Revicki et al, 2004).

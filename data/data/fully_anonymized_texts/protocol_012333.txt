Period  December 2016  to December 2020  
Study Objectives:  Primary Study Objectives:  
There are two primary objectives for this study aimed to determine;  
1. The success of treatment at the subject level (“responder 
analysis”) [ADDRESS_267954] OTL -101 infusion , defined as:  
a) Evidence of erythrocyte ADA enzyme activity above 
baseline/pre -treatment level (>0 Units),  
b) Evidence of immune reconstitution (absolute number of CD3 
cells ≥200/mm3),   
c) Detectable gene -marked granulocytes by [CONTACT_223001] (dPCR)/qPCR (≥1/10,000 cells).  
This 6  month data will be used to compare the proportion of 
respon ders among subjects treated with the cryopreserved 
population with a comparable population obtained from one of the 
ongoing Phase  I/II studies using the fresh formulation.  
2. The overall survival and event free survival at 12  months among 
ADA -SCID subjects tr eated with a cryopreserved formulation of 
OTL -101.  
Overall survival is defined as the proportion of subjects alive. 
Event -free survival is defined as the proportion of subjects alive 
with no “event”, an “event” being the resumption of PEG -ADA 
ERT or the n eed for a rescue allogenic HSCT, or death.  
Secondary Study Objectives  
The secondary objectives to be evaluated among ADA -SCID 
subjects treated with a cryopreserved formulation of OTL -101 
include confirmation of the overall survival and event free survival 
at 24  months, safety evaluation including infection rates, quality of 
life and immune response.  
Exploratory Study Objectives  
Exploratory objectives include the measurement of biological 
correlates of efficacy including; percentage of gene marking in 
peripheral blood granulocytes, vector integration analysis,  
quantification of clonal diversity of vector integrants, T -cell receptor

(FACS) for T -cell receptor (TCR) V -β family use, ADA enzyme 
activity in erythrocytes, total adenine nucleotides in erythrocytes, and 
immune reconstitution. . 
Study Design:  This is a prospective, non -randomized, single -cohort, longitudinal, 
single -center, clinical study designed to assess the efficacy and safety 
of OTL -101 cryopreserved formulation administered in ADA -SCID 
subjects aged between ≥30 days to <18 years of age, w ho are not 
eligible for an HLA -matched sibling/family donor and meeting the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. This study aims to recruit [ADDRESS_267956] level (“res ponder analysis”) [ADDRESS_267957] OTL -101 
infusion , using predictive criteria for overall survival and event free 
survival and to compare data obtained from clin ical studies u sing the 
fresh formulation of OTL -101. 
Eligible subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222927]34+ cells. A backup harvest  of non -transduced CD34+  
cells will be obtained during the harvesting procedure to be used in 
the event of i) product damage during the thawing of the OTL -[ADDRESS_267958] that would prevent infusi on of OTL -101 although the patient 
has already been conditioned or ii) lack of engraftment/hematopo ietic 
reconstitution [ADDRESS_267959] infusion of OTL -101. A failure of 
hematologic reconstitution is defined as persistent ANC < 200/µl or 
platelets < 20,000/µl  on three independent and consecutive 
determinations over at least ten days  after day 42 from the day of 
OTL -101 infusion . 
OTL -101 is a cryopreserved formulation of autologous CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cells transduced ex vivo with EFS LV encoding 
for the human ADA gene (OTL 101). To enable the release of OTL -
[ADDRESS_267960], 
PEG -ADA  ERT use will be evaluated at the 1 Month follow -up visit 
([ADDRESS_267961] treatment ± 7 days) and discontinued at Day 30 ( -3/+15) 
after the transplant. Hematologic  reconstitution will be assessed at 
Day 42 (± 7 days), and in the event of no reconstitution th e backup 
HSC sample will be administered, if the investigator believes this is 
in the subject’s best interest. The subjects will then be seen at regular 
intervals to review their history, perform examinations and draw 
blood samples at Months 3, 6 and 9 (al l ± 2 weeks) as well as Months

12, 18 and 24 (all ± 4 weeks). Any medically -indicated interventions, 
including the need to reinstate PEG -ADA  ERT , will be assessed at 
all follow -up visits after Month [ADDRESS_267962] will be given ERT and/or HSCT, if 
available and deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. After the 
Month [ADDRESS_267963] (DSMB), who will review the nature and severity 
of emerging safety data during the study. The DSMB will also liaise 
with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_222928]. The Investigator, subjects and their 
families will be informed about any significant emerging safety data.   
Study Population:  This study aims to enrol 10  eligible subjects aged ≥30 days and 
<18 years,  with a diagnosis of ADA -SCID and ineligible for matched 
family allogeneic bone marrow transplantation  
Duration of 
Participation:  The total study duration for each subject is estimated to be up to 
2 years and 4 months . 
Study Evaluations:  Primary endpoints for this study include:  
1. Evaluation of OTL -[ADDRESS_267964] based 
on the following parameters and their  thresholds:  
 Erythrocyte  ADA  enzyme activity above baseline/pre -
treatment level  (>0 Units ),  
 Absolute CD3+ T -cell counts ≥200/mm3, and  
 Peripheral blood samples positive for vector sequences by 
[CONTACT_62865]( ≥1/10,000 cells).  
Subjects must meet all three criteria. Subjects not meeting these 
criteria will be designated a failure (non -responder)  and will be 
withdrawn from the study. This data will be used to  compare 
subject data from one of the ongoing Phase  I/II studies using the 
fresh formulation.  
2. Evaluate the overall survival and event free survival [ADDRESS_267965] OTL -101 infusion . Overall survival is defined as the 
proportion of subjects alive. Event -free survival is defined as the 
proportion of subjects alive with no “event ”, an “event ” being the  
resumption of PEG -ADA ERT or the need for a rescue allogenic 
HSCT, or death.  
 Secondary endpoints include:  
 Evaluate the overall survival and event free survival 
[ADDRESS_267966] OTL -101 infusion.  
 Immunoglobulin Replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_222929].

intractable dia rrhoea).  
 Response to tetanus vaccination.  
 Immune reconstitution: T and B cell reconstitution . 
 The exploratory endpoints will include laboratory correlates of 
efficacy that will be used to assess the level of gene correction, 
engraftment and immune reconstitution as exploratory endpoints. . 
Safety 
Evaluations:  The safety and tolerability of OTL -[ADDRESS_267967] results, vital 
signs measurements, el ectrocardiogram (ECG) and physical 
examination results, and concomitant medication usage.  
Statistical 
Considerations : The statistical analyses of efficacy data will be performed in three 
stages:  
1. The first analysis will compare the success/failure data [ADDRESS_267968] OTL -101 infusion  between fresh and cryop reserved OTL -
101 formulations. The success/failure of the OTL -101  will be 
defined by [CONTACT_223004]. This 
data will be compared with available data from one of the  ongoing 
Phase  I/II studies usin g the OTL -[ADDRESS_267969] disposition, safety and 
Busulfan  pharmacokinetic ( PK) data will also be described.  
Effica cy analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature.

1 B ACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1 Introduction 
A brief overview of the disease and the protocol treatment (OTL-101) is provided in this 
section; however, a comprehensive review is supplied in the Investigator Brochure (IB). 
1.1.1 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency due to Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency  
S
evere combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders 
characterised by a profound reduction or absence of T lymphocyte function ( Chinn 2015). 
Ade
nosine deaminase (ADA)-SCID was identified almost four decades ago and represents 
approximately 15-20% of all cases of SCID. Adenosine deaminase is a ubiquitous enzyme 
whose deficiency results in metabolic toxicity. The main features of the disease are impaired 
differentiation and function of T, B and natural killer ( NK) lymphocytes, recurrent infections, 
a
nd failure to thrive. In addition, non-immunological abnormalities occur as the consequence 
of the systemic metabolic defect, indicating that the disease is more complex than other forms 
of SCID. Adenosine deaminase-SCID is a genetic disorder and mutations in the ADA gene  
cause a lack or the poor functioning of the ADA enzyme leading to accumulation of Ado, 
d-Ado, and adenine deoxyribonucleotides (d-AXP) in plasma, red blood cells (RBC), and 
ti
ssues. The severity of genetic mutations and the residual ADA activity are usually related to 
the age of onset, clinical manifestations, and levels of d-AXP ( Hirschhorn 1990 ). 
The majority of ADA-SCID patients are diagnosed in the first year of life. The patients rarely 
survive beyond [ADDRESS_267997] with pathogens is 
avoided by [CONTACT_40397] a sterile environment around the patient (the so-called “bubble-children”). 
Lymphopenia, absence of both cellular and humoral functions, developmental delay, failure to 
thrive, and recurrent infections due to fungal, viral, and opportunistic agents are the key features 
of these early onset forms. These forms are essentially indistinguishable from other forms of 
SCID, with the exception for bony abnormalities in 50% of patients. 
1.1.2 Treatment Options  
Two therapeutic methods are currently used for the treatment of ADA SCID, hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and ADA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) but both 
options have significant limitations. This paved the way for the proposed OTL-101 treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-
compatible sibling donors is the treatment of choice for patients with SCID and other severe 
variants of primary immunodeficiency resulting in long-term survival of about 90% of patients 
and effective immune reconstitution ( Ferrua 2010 ). However, as only 10–20% of patients are 
a
ble to receive HSCT from an HLA-identical family member ( Stephan 1993 , Antoine 2003 ), 
transplants are often performed from mismatched family or matched unrelated donors (MUD). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_222932]-conditioning and post-transplant care, the use of less well matched 
HSCT is associated with reduced survival ( Gaspar 2009, H assan 2012 ) and delayed or 
suboptimal immune reconstitution in a significant fraction of surviving patients as a result of 
poor early engraftment or gradual decline in immune functions ( Railey 2009 ). Complications 
such as Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), autoimmune and inflammatory manifestations, 
persistent infections, and disease-related issues are often observed.  
If a matched sibling/family donor is unavailable, most ADA-SCID patients are treated with 
AD
A ERT. Enzyme replacement therapy leads to metabolic correction and clinical 
ORCHARD THERAPEUTICS, LTD. OTL- 101-4 
 CO

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 23/130 
 
im
provement, but the immunological reconstitution is often incomplete and dysregulated 
(Hershfield 1987 , G aspar 2009 , S auer 2012 ) and therefore individuals remain at risk of severe 
infection. This approach does not represent a curative treatment modality and is not always 
available as a long-term option. Enzyme replacement therapy with polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-
ADA was developed based on the concept that reduction of ADA substrate concentration in 
plasma results in lowering of intracellular concentrations of metabolites ( Hershfield 1995 ). An 
intramuscular injection of PEG-ADA is administered weekly or bi-weekly, and is considered 
to be an excellent (although very expensive) short-term measure to stabilize children with 
ADA-SCID; however, prolonged use has associated risks as described in the IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gene Therapy 
Gene therapy offers an alternative treatment for ADA-SCID whereby a correctly functioning 
copy of the ADA gene  is introduced into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that have been 
harvested from the patients themselves using a gene transfer vector. The transduced cells are 
then returned to the patient where they initiate immune reconstitution much like HSCs from a 
healthy donor. Because the cells originate from the patient, the likelihood of complications is 
reduced and there is no need to find a suitable donor. Importantly, unlike ERT, the treatment is 
curative. Earlier approaches relied on murine gammaretroviral vectors (GRV) to introduce the 
ADA gene  into the patient’s cells. Lentiviral vectors (LV) are derived from components of the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 lentivirus and display several attributes that make 
them potentially more effective and safe than retroviral vectors ( Naldini 1996 , Z ufferey 1998 ) 
as described in Section 1.4.2 .  
No gene therapy treatment has been approved in [LOCATION_002] (US) to date.  In Europe, 
Strimvelis®  is approved for the “treatment of subjects with ADA -SCID, for whom no suitable 
HLA matched related stem cell donor is available”.   Strimvelis®  is a GRV based ex vivo gene 
ther
apy treatment .  
1.2
 Name [CONTACT_223102] (OTL-101) is a cell suspension comprising autologous CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cells that are transduced ex vivo  with Elongation Factor 1α Short form 
(EFS) LV encoding for the human ADA gene .  
To create OTL-101, autologous CD34+ HSCs from ADA-SCID subjects will be modified using 
EF
S-ADA LV, a self-inactivating (SIN) LV expressing the ADA gene  codon optimized for 
human use and regulated by [CONTACT_143907].  
The
 cryopreserved formulation will be thawed at the subject’s bedside and infused directly 
without any further manipulation.   
Orphan Drug Designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation were granted for this gene 
therapy medicinal product (OTL-101 ) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 
[ADDRESS_267998] 2015, respectively. 
1.3
 Findings from Non-Clinical and Clinical Studies 
1.3.1 Non-Clinical Studies  
The non-clinical studies demonstrated the EFS-ADA LV developed by [CONTACT_223006]34+ cells (the target cells for human 
use) from healthy donors and ADA-SCID patients. Transduction efficiency was at levels 
comparable to GRV used successfully in gene therapy clinical studies. However, significant

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 24/[ADDRESS_267999] blood (UCB) or bone marrow (BM) of normal or ADA-deficient individuals. In vivo , 
CD34+ cells from ADA-SCID patient bone marrow were transduced with the EFS LV encoding 
for the human ADA  gene  before being injected in immunodeficient mice. The studies 
demonstrated that the transduced cells engrafted and differentiated in a human xenograft model. 
Finally, a proof -of-concept study was performed in an experimental ADA  deficient mouse  
model. This study demonstrated that cells transduced with the EFS LV encoding for the human 
ADA  gene  enabled T and B  cell recovery; in addition to ADA enzymatic activity. Overall these 
results demonstrate the biological activity of CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo with EFS -ADA 
LV.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_268000] round of studies 
demonstrated that the EFS LV (encoding the human ADA gene ) is not mutagenic and did not 
induce tumors in  in vivo models. In addition, in a separate  study, the proliferative capacity of 
clones of cells transduced with the vector was assessed and was found to be negligible. 
Therefore, OTL -[ADDRESS_268001] a safe profile .  
Ove
rall these results demonstrate that the EFS LV (encoding the human ADA  gene  or a reporter 
green fluorescent protein gene ) is not mutagenic and d oes not induce tumours in in vivo models.  
1.3.3 Clinical Studies  
Two parallel Phase I/II studies investigating the clinical effectiveness and safety of EFS-ADA 
LV-
modified autologous CD34+ cells have been performed to date.  
A 
first study, entitled: “Autologous Transplantation of Bone Marrow CD34+ Stem/Progenitor 
Cells after Addition of a Normal Human ADA cDNA by [CONTACT_223007]- ADA LV for Adenosine 
Deaminase-Severe Combined immunodeficiency”) at University of [LOCATION_004] Los Angeles 
(UCLA) in the US began in May [ADDRESS_268002] been treated under this 
protocol (as of 14 October 2016) and a single subject has been treated under an expanded access 
program. 
A second study, conducted in parallel, entitled: “Phase I/II, non-controlled, open-label, 
non-
randomised, single-centre study to assess the safety and efficacy of EFS-ADA LV 
mediated gene modification of autologous CD34+ cells from ADA-deficient individuals” began 
in August [ADDRESS_268003] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (GOSH) University College London (UCL) 
in the [LOCATION_008] ( [LOCATION_006]). Currently, [ADDRESS_268004] also been treated under compassionate use in the [LOCATION_006] (as of 14 
October 2016).   
In both studies, subjects receive PEG-ADA ERT and Busulfan conditioning before receiving a 
fr
esh formulation of EFS- ADA LV-transduced CD34+ HSCs . Following treatment, subjects 
continue to receive PEG-ADA ERT for a further [ADDRESS_268005] received comparable doses, characterized by [CONTACT_223008]34+ HSCs, as well as in transduction efficacy (vector copy number (VCN)) and

e
fficiency (vector positive colony forming unit analysis) in the OTL-[ADDRESS_268006] importantly, there appears to be extremely consistent 
immune reconstitution outcomes between the two studies: cell counts for all of the T and B cell 
populations and subpopulations demonstrate consistent and stable immune reconstitution over 
time post GTMP infusion at 6, 12, and 24 months in both studie s. As per 31 March 2016 data 
cut, the overall survival for the both studies is currently 100%. The event free survival for the 
second study (GOSH/UCL, [LOCATION_006]) is currently 93.3%. One subject from the second study was 
clinically indicated to restart ERT with PEG-ADA, although none from the first study (UCLA) 
ha
s required a restart of PEG- ADA (N =18, as per 31 March 2016 data cut). 
N
o serious unexpected adverse events have been reported in both studies to date. There have 
be
en no vector-related complications and no instances of leukoproliferation, as reported in GRV 
studies for other immune deficiencies. There have been no cases of autoimmunity with the EFS-
ADA LV reported to date. The safety profile of the two ongoing studies have been remarkable 
and the benefit/risk profile remains positive. 
Since
 both studies are still ongoing, formal analysis comparing both studies has not been 
completed.  
1.4 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits 
1.4.1
 Potential Benefits  
Adenosine deaminase-SCID represents a paradigmatic approach for gene therapy for inherited 
blood borne
 disorders. The results of clinical studies from 2000 onwards indicate that gene 
therapy with non-myeloablative conditioning is associated with significant clinical clinical 
benefit and should be considered for all ADA-SCID patients lacking an HLA-identical 
sibling/family donor ( Aiuti 2002 , Aiuti 2009, Ga spar 2011 , Candotti 2012 ). However, LV offer 
several potential advantages over murine GRV used in the previous studies, including the 
recently European Union approved treatment, Strimvelis®, GlaxoSmithKline. There is no gene 
therapy treatment for ADA -SCID approved in the US to date. 
L
entiviral vectors lack dependence on cell division such that the culture period and exposure to 
cytokines can be minimized and HSC activity can theoretically be preserved.  
Durable, life-long clinical benefit is highly dependent on the successful engraftment of 
genetically modified long term repopulating HSC.  The improved correction of HSCs should 
result in improved immune recovery due to correction of both T and B cell populations. 
Most importantly, LV have potential for a more favorable safety profile. Insertional 
oncogenesis (IO) is a possible consequence of the integration of retroviral vectors into the 
human genome, in which transcription of the therapeutic gene is under the control of the viral 
enhancer promoters present in the long terminal repeat (LTR). In previous GRV studies, 
oncogenesis has been caused by [CONTACT_223009] ( Hacein-Bey-Abina 2008 , Howe 2008 , 
Braun 2014 ). Thus far, none of the ADA-SCID subjects treated with GRV (N=42) have had 
e
vidence of IO despi[INVESTIGATOR_222933]-modified autologous HSC. Nevertheless, the use 
of alternative vector systems such as the LV with the SIN LTR configuration have improved 
integration profiles ( Biffi 2011 ) and allows for the use of safer, less transactivating cellular 
promoters. Immortalization studies in vitro  (IVIM) have shown that the potential of SIN LV 
ORCHARD THERAPEUTICS, LTD. OTL- 101-4 
 CO
NFIDENTIAL 
  
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 26/130 
 
with 
cellular promotors to transactivate neighboring genes is significantly diminished ( Modlich 
2006, Modlich 2009 ).  Furthermore, the EFS cellular promoter has resulted in negligible 
outgrowth of clones in the IVIM assay ( Zychlinski 2008, Carbonaro 2014).  
The
refore the use of LV and EFS-ADA LV, in particular, can thus promote similar or even 
im
proved immune recovery with the potential for enhanced genetically-modified HSC activity 
a
nd an enhanced safety, and therefore represents a significant advantage in furthering the use 
of 
gene therapy for ADA-SCID. 
Tr
ansplants of autologous CD34+ HSCs transduced with the EFS-ADA LV have resulted in 
clinical benefits in the vast majority of subjects treated to date. It is too early to determine 
whether these subjects will have durable, life-long ADA gene  expression/enzyme production 
and immune function, but the results indicate 100% survival, with all but one subject stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_222934]- ADA ERT. The longest follow-up is [ADDRESS_268007].  
The
 aim of this protocol is to expand the safety and efficacy database for OTL-101 and support 
analytical chemistry, manufacturing, and control ( CMC ) comparability between fresh and 
cryopreserved OTL -101 for mulations .   
1.4.2
 Potential Risks   
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Potential Risks Related to the Protocol Treatment 
The major risks to be considered with OTL-101 treatment are: 
1) I
nsertional oncogenesis (and leukemia) - risks related to IO have occurred during 
clinical studies of gene transfer using GRV in subjects with X-linked SCID and Wiskot t 
Aldrich Syndrome, but not ADA-SCID thus far. Studies have demonstrated that the 
risks of insertional mutagenesis are lower with LV that lack strong LTR 
enhancer/promoter sequences (as in the EFS-ADA LV) than with GRV with an intact 
LTR. In current LV subjects (39 subjects treated to date), there have been no cases of 
oncogenicity. Pre-clinical in vitro insertional mutagenesis studies have confirmed that 
the LV used in this clinical program has a lower risk versus the G RV. 
2) Replication-competent virus exposure - there is a small possibility and risk from this 
gene therapy treatment that undetected Replication Competent Lentivirus (RCL) might 
be present and cause an active HIV infection in the subjects. To date there has been no 
instance of RCL in subjects treated with autologous genetically modified HSC with a 
GRV or LV. 
3) Germ-line transmission of vector sequences - as the EFS- ADA LV will be used to 
transduce ex vivo CD34+ cells, rather than a direct administration to subjects via 
parenteral route, the probability of germ-line transmission is considered to be negligible. 
ORCHARD THERAPEUTICS, LTD. OTL- 101-4 
 CO
NFIDENTIAL 
  
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 27/130 
 
4) Aller
gic/immunological responses to cell processing excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] - stem cell factor and 
thrombopoietin are used to maintain stem cell viability and to promote gene transfer 
during the ex vivo  transduction process. When these factors are administered 
parenterally, they may have untoward immunologic or allergic consequences such as 
thrombocytopenia or allergic reactions. 
5) Risk of using cryopreserved bone marrow stem cells. Although in vitro  tests showed 
that cryopreserved genetically-modified bone marrow CD34+ HSC were similar to the 
fresh cells used in previous clinical studies, it is possible that the cryopreserved 
formulation of OTL-101 will not work as well in subjec ts, resulting in poorer recovery 
of 
immune function or even the need to receive back the unmodified bone marrow that 
was saved as back-up.   
6) As thawed OTL-101 is infused, an unusual odor or bad taste in the mouth may be 
experienced. This odor or taste is from the substance dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) used 
to protect the cells when OTL-[ADDRESS_268008] heart rate, or 
shortness of breath. Subjects will be monitored closely during the OTL-101 infusion. 
7) Immune response against “normal” ADA – as a result of "immunisation" to normal 
human 
ADA produced from the transgene. Most subjects will have previously received 
bovine PEG- ADA  ERT, which is more likely to be immunogenic than human ADA. 
Also, development of significant inhibitory antibodies has been relatively rare in 
patients treated with PEG- ADA ERT alone. 
8) Other immunological risks - onset of autoimmunity is of concern in post-treatment 
ADA-SCID patients. 
9) Immune dysregulation - gene transfer research may result in only partial improvement 
of the immune system. While this is unlikely to be a problem, it is possible that partial 
im
provement leading to an "imbalance" of the immune system could have adverse 
effects. Two children treated in the UCLA study using fresh OTL-[ADDRESS_268009] 
fully recovered, suggesting the inflammatory reaction may be temporary. Both children 
remain free of PEG-ADA therapy. 
10) F
ailure of the treatment. 
The
se risks are fully described in the IB.

[IP_ADDRESS]
 Potential Risks Related to Concomitant Therapy  
Busulfan 
Busulfan is used  for conditioning prior to the re-infusion of the HSCs. The Busulfan dose to be 
used in this clinical study will target a specific area under the curve ( AUC ), which will ensure 
more precise dosing and may reduce the risks of toxicity. The risks attached to Busulfan are 
minimal, although there is a very small possibility of Busulfan-related cancer.  
More common risks associated with Busulfan at higher doses include nausea, vomiting, 
diar
rhoea, constipation, loss of appetite, mouth sores, stomach/abdominal pain, dizziness, 
swelling ankles/feet/hand, flushing, headache, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] a period of neutropaenia. 
However, the above systemic side-effects have not been seen at the proposed Busulfan dose for 
this study. 
In the Sponsor's experience to date, there have been no Busulfan-related serious adverse events 
(SAEs ). 
Pegylated- ADA  
The withdrawal of PEG-ADA, which is required [ADDRESS_268010] does not 
respond to OTL-101 infusion.  
I
n the Sponsor's experience to date, there have been no severe infections nor causalities, related 
to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_222936]- ADA  ERT, 1 month after OTL-101 infusion as per protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Other Potential Risks 
Participation in this clinical study may have deleterious effects on subsequent attempts at 
allogeneic HSCT due to the "immunization" to normal human ADA produced from the 
tra
nsgene. Gene therapy for ADA-SCID using autologous stem cells, albeit with other vectors, 
has now been performed in 79  subjects, with over 15 years of follow-up. The results show that 
these
 subjects did not experience any permanently debilitating nor deleterious side effects, 
suggesting that the risk of long term side effects is low. 
As in any new form of therapy, there may be risks that are unknown or not anticipated.   
1.5 Selection of Protocol Treatment Dosage 
Cryopreserved autologous CD34+ HSCs transduced ex vivo  with EFS LV encoding for the 
human ADA gene  will be administered at a dose range of 2.0 x 10e 6 to 20  x 10e6 C D34+

a target minimum of 2 .0 x 10e 6 CD34+ cells/kg of OTL -101 is deemed sufficient to restore

2 P URPOSE OF THE STUDY AND STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Purpose of the Study 
The
 primary purpose of the study is to further explore the efficacy and safety of gene therapy 
with OTL-101, as an alternative treatment option for ADA-SCID patients. The current 
treatment of choice for ADA-SCID patients is a HLA-matched sibling/family HSCT, however 
the 
number of patients eligible for this procedure ranges from 10 to 20% ( Hassan 2012 ). 
OTL-101 is a gene therapy that aims to use genetically modified autologous CD34+ HSC from 
the individual patients to improve the outcome of transplantation to a wider population. Two 
ongoing P hase  I/II studies use a fresh cell formulation that is required to be infused within 
6 hours of manufacture. A cryopreserved formulation of OTL -101 was developed to enable the 
treatment, once m anufactured from the individual  subjec ts’ CD34+ cells, to be frozen and 
stored until the OTL -[ADDRESS_268013]  is fully released  (i.e. all q uality control testing  performed) , 
allowing the subjec t to receive targeted conditioning prior to tra nsplantation. The cryopreserved 
formulation will also permit the treatment to be shipped and delivered to a local expert site, 
thereby [CONTACT_223011][INVESTIGATOR_222937]. The advantages of a 
cryopreserved formulation are not limit ed to shelf -life and include ; a n improved manufacturing 
process ; improved  quality of the OTL -[ADDRESS_268014] already been treated with cryopreserved cells (with a different 
cryoprotectant as the one used under this protocol) ; two patients treated under Compassionate 
Use Program  and one patient treated as an exemption in the US . All three  subjects d emonstrated 
immune reconstitution and are currently event free  indicating success  of the OTL -101 
treatment .  
Additionally, the purpose of this study is to support the analytical CMC comparability of the 
cryopreserved versus fresh OTL-101 formulation with an interim analysis of clinical outcomes 
from the five subjects, based on predictive parameters at 6 months of overall survival and event 
free survival: gene -marked granulocytes , ADA enzyme activity, and absolute CD3+ cell 
number . 
These parameters are deemed adequate predictors at 6 months as well as long-term predictors 
for overall survival and event free survival based on the sponsor experience and previous gene 
therapy treatment.  
 Ge ne- marked granulocytes 
Af
ter genetic modification of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and 
reinfusion to the subject, the presence of genetically modified cells both in the periphery 
and in the BM can be used as a bona fide marker of the existence and the persistence of 
transduced cells in the subject. Genetically modified cells engraftment is usually 
assessed in the blood compartment that is readily accessible, via evaluation of the pro-
viral VCN by [CONTACT_223012] (especially the granulocytes). 
Thus, by [CONTACT_223013]-lived genetically modified progenitors in the BM (as VCN in BM CD34+ cells 
shows a close positive correlation with VCN in granulocytes). In our ongoing studies 
with fresh product formulation, over 3 months after administration of OTL-101 the 
g
ranulocyte VCN rises and is then stable up to 2 years after gene therapy treatment 
(based on our current follow up), therefore if a plateau is reached at 6 months (above 
ORCHARD THERAPEUTICS, LTD. OTL- 101-4 
 CO

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 31/130 
 
1/10,000 
cells), it is predictive of sustained effect. These data are similar between both 
ongoing Phase I/II studies.  
 AD A Enzyme Activity in red blood cells  
ADA enzyme activity in RBC reflects normalized/corrected biological activity of 
transduced CD34+ HSCs. As per experience from fresh formulation studies, there is 
peak observed at [ADDRESS_268015] OTL-101 infusion and then the level stabilizes for up to 
24 months, based on our current data. Therefore, erythrocyte ADA enzyme activity 
a
bove baseline/pre-treatment level compared to post treatment level at 6 months is 
predictive of long-term efficacy. 
 C D3+ cells number 
The engraftment of genetically modified CD34+ HSCs in this disease setting should 
give rise to immune system development. Based on experience from previous clinical 
trials based on gene transfer to CD34+ HSCs, longitudinal copy number quantitative 
determination in T cells revealed that the T cell pattern was stable with time. It is 
important to remind that T cell normal values were reached between 2 to 5 months after 
OTL-101 infusion in subjec ts. Therefore, corrective levels of T cells were stable from 
6 months to 10 years after OTL-101 infusion. Data suggests that once engraftment of 
g
enetically modified HSCs occurs and immune development is seen, CD3+ cells 
>200/mm3, there is no diminution of immune cell development ( Hace in-Bey-Abina 
2010). The data from the clinical studies using the fresh formulation of OTL-101 concur 
with 
these findings. Clinically, this also means that once immune recovery is seen and 
is s
ustained, the need to restart ERT is negated. 
2.2 Study Objectives 
2.2.1 Primary Study Objectives  
There are two primary objectives for this study aimed to determine; 
1. The  success of treatment at the subject level (“responder analysis”) [ADDRESS_268016] OTL-
101 infusion
, defined as :  
a
) Evidence of erythrocyte ADA enzyme activity above baseline/pre-treatment level 
(>0 Units), 
b) E
vidence of immune reconstitution (absolute number of CD3 cells ≥200/mm3),   
c) Detectable gene-marked granulocytes by [CONTACT_223014] 
(dPCR)/qPCR (≥1/10,000 cells). 
This [ADDRESS_268017] s 
tre
ated with the cryopreserved population with that in a comparable population obtained 
from one of the ongoing Phase I/II studies using the fresh formulation. 
2. The  overall survival and event free survival at 12 months among ADA-SCID subjects 
treated with a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101.  
Ove
rall survival is defined as the proportion of subjects alive. Event-free survival is 
defined as the proportion of subjects alive with no “event”, an “event” being the 
re
sumption of PEG-ADA ERT or the need for a rescue allogenic HSCT, or death.

3 S TUDY DESIGN 
3.1 General Design and Study Scheme 
This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-cohort, longitudinal, single-center, clinical study 
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of OTL-101 cryopreserved formulation administered 
in ADA
-SCID subjects aged between ≥30 days to <18 years of age, who are not eligible for an 
H
LA-matched sibling/family donor and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This study 
a
ims to recruit [ADDRESS_268018] level 
(“responder analysis”) [ADDRESS_268019] OTL-101 infusion, using predictive criteria for overall 
surviva
l and event free survival and to compare this with data obtained from one of the ongoing 
Phase I/II clinical studies using the fresh formulation of OTL-101. 
Onc
e informed consent has been obtained, the subjects enrolled will be screened to determine 
their full eligibility for participation over 1 month.  
Elig
ible subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222938]34+ cells. A 
backup harvest of non-transduced CD34+cells will be obtained during the harvesting procedure 
to 
be used in the event of i) product damage during the thawing of OTL-[ADDRESS_268020] although the patient has already been conditioned or ii) lack of 
engraftment/hematopoietic reconstitution [ADDRESS_268021] infusion of OTL-101. A failure of 
hematologic reconstitution is defined as persistent ANC < 200/µl or p latelets < 20,000/µl on 
three independent and consecutive determinations over at least ten days  after day 42 fr om the 
day of OTL -101 infusion .  
OT
L-101 is a cryopreserved formulation of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells 
tra
nsduced ex vivo  with EFS LV encoding for the human ADA  gene  (OTL -101). To enable the 
release of the OTL-[ADDRESS_268022], PEG-ADA ERT use will be 
evaluated at the 1 Month follow-up visit ([ADDRESS_268023] treatment ± 7 days) and discontinued at 
Day 30 (-3/+15) after the transplant. Hematologic reconstitution will be assessed at Day 42 (± 
7 days), and in the event of no reconstitution the backup HSC sample will be administered, if 
the investigator believes this is in the subject’s best interest. The subjects will then be seen at 
regular intervals to review their history, perform examinations and draw blood samples at 
Months 3, 6 and 9 (all ± 2 weeks) as well as Months 12, 18 and 24 (all ± 4 weeks). Any 
medically-indicated interventions, including the need to reinstate PEG- ADA  ERT, will be 
assessed at all follow-up visits after Month 1.  Hematopoietic reconstitution will be assessed 
a
gain at the Month [ADDRESS_268024] will 
be given ERT and/or HSCT, if available and deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. After the

4.[ADDRESS_268070] Withdrawal Criteria  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (and with the applicable country’s approval), 
each subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The Investigator also 
has the right to withdraw a subject from the study in the event of concurrent illness, AEs, 
pregnancy (see Section  8.2.4 ), or other reasons concerning the health or wellbeing of the 
subject, or in the event of a lack of cooperation. In addition, a subject may be withdrawn from 
the study as described in Section  3.6.  
Should withdrawal occur, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations up 
to the time of withdrawal as thoroughly as possible. A complete final evaluation should be made 
at the time of the subject’s withdrawal (see Section 5.1.8 ) and an explanation given of why the 
subject is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study. The reason for and date of 
withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the eCRF. If a subject withdraws consent, every 
attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason for withdrawal is an AE or a 
clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, monitoring will continue until the event has

the time they have been performed. The parents/legal guardian s of each subject will 
acknowledge and agree to the possible use of this information for the study by [CONTACT_223026]. 
After informed consent is obtained, subjects who are screened will be assigned a [ADDRESS_268076] (Visit 2: 
Assessment B).. The screening visit (Visit 1) is defined as the visit during which the informed 
consent form is signed, before any study-related procedures.  
The following assessments will be performed during the screening period so as to determine 
the subject’s eligibility:

the period required by [CONTACT_223027]),  
 Serum HCG (pregnancy test) if female of child-bearing age (and if more than [ADDRESS_268080]),  
 Urinalysis.  
Bone Marrow Harvest (Assessment  B) 
For BM harvesting, a central venous access device will be required (if not already in place) for 
ease of phlebotomy and drug administration. The decision between PI[INVESTIGATOR_67688], a tunneled 
central venous catheter, or an implanted subcutaneous access device will be made by 
[CONTACT_223028]. A PI[INVESTIGATOR_222953] a separate procedure with appropriate sedation or during the 
general anesthesia for the BM harvest.  
The
 harvest procedure will involve a bilateral BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_222954], where 
a total volume required should be between 15-20 ml/kg  of the subjects body weight. The BM 
sample will be directly transported to the GMP manufacturing location. 
Compatible irradiated PRBC (10 to 15 cc/kg) may be transfused following the completion of 
marrow harvest, if considered appropriate by [CONTACT_737].   
If the subject is otherwise well, he/she may be discharged to home, 1-[ADDRESS_268081] 
OTL-101 infusion (see S ection 3.4 ), and must constitute ≥3.0 x 10e7 mononuclear cells/kg.   
The backup sample will be cryopreserved, and CD34+ cells will be isolated from the remainder. 
The backup harvest will consist of  non-transduced cells that will be retained if required. A 
sec
ond backup sample is only required if the first backup is not reliable, e.g. if contamination 
of the initial marrow harvest had occurred. 
5.1.3 Baseline (Visit 3)  
Pre-Conditioning (Assessment C) 
After BM harvest and if the autologous OTL-[ADDRESS_268082] has met the release criteria 
(Section 3.7.1 ), additional baseline samples must be collected for the following tests within

The subjects will be kept in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222959] [ADDRESS_268093] OTL-101 
infusion. However, they may be kept in for longer if this is deemed clinically necessary and 
depending on the medical care they require (e.g. central venous catheter care, infections, 
protective isolation, nutritional support), the consequences of toxicity due to Busulfan, the 
engraftment of transduced cells, and immune reconstitution. Alternatively, for subjects who are 
not 
geographically close to the clinical site who are clinically stable, post-transplant care may 
be transferred to the home physician provided the identified clinician agrees to assume this 
post-transplant monitoring. The home physician will be asked to record all protocol specific 
assessments on a form provided. This data will be transmitted to the Investigator for data entry

to determine whether the genetically modified cells have engrafted and are able to produce 
mature lymphoid and hematopoietic cells containing and expressing the ADA gene , and the 
extent and time-course of immune reconstitution.   
The subjects will be evaluated at the following time-points: Month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 
(e

of blood that can be obtained from young children, it may not be possible to perform every 
scheduled investigation listed below at each time-point. Therefore, the priority for the ranking 
of blood tests will be as per the order presented for each visit. The following examinations will 
be performed:

This 
study does not permit the use of OTL-101 for purposes other than those defined in this 
protoc

intravenous infusion over 5 to 15  minutes, according to the instruction described in Section 17: 
Appendix 1 , beginning as soon as possible (and no longer than 30 minutes) after the final 
thawing steps. The subject will be pre-medicated with an appropriate dosage of acetaminophen 
(e.g., 10 to 15  mg/kg orally ), and diphenhydramine (e.g., 0.5 to 1.0  mg/kg intrav enous  or 
orally ), 15 to 90  minutes prior to infusion.  
F
inal OTL-101 Dose and Infusion Volume Calculations: 
D
ose calculation forms are provided in Section 17: Appendix [ADDRESS_268101]’s medical notes. 
Dose calculation : 
1. Prior to Busulfan administration, calculate the total Final Product (FP) CD34+ cells per 
kg as described on the appropriate worksheet. All values required to perform the 
calculation will be found on the Certificate of Analysis for the OTL-[ADDRESS_268102] course of action based on the following criteria:  
 The  Total FP CD34+ cells per kg  is less than 2.0x106 CD34+/kg.  An additional final 
product manufacturing process will be required to obtain the minimum acceptable dose,  
 The  Total FP CD34+ cells per kg  is greater than 2.0x106 CD34+/kg and less than 
20.0x106 CD34+/kg . Thaw and infuse the entire combined final product volume, 
 The  Total FP CD34+ cells per kg  is greater than 20.0x106 CD34+/kg. The volume to 
infuse must be calculated as described on the appropriate worksheet.  Do not rinse the

a
ccording to the physician's criteria if reconstitution is not observed by [CONTACT_2006] 42. Subject s may 
receive transfusions to give more time to observe whether signs of hematopoietic reconstitution 
are seen. This is not documented in the Schedule of Events tables as rescue procedures would 
follow standard institute protocols.

Any prior or concomitant therapy or medication given to a subject from Visit 1 before OTL-101 
a
dministration and during the study will be documented in the eCRF. Dose and generic name 
[CONTACT_223104]. The Sponsor will encode all therapy and medication according 
to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary. 
6.2.1 Permitted Concomitant Medication/Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Transplant-related Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_119057]-myeloa blative conditioning with Busulfan 
On Day -[ADDRESS_268107] will be given a loading dose of an anti-convulsant drug (e.g. 
levetiracetam (10 mg/kg intravenous slow infusion) or clonazepam (0.02 mg/kg orally q 
12 hours) prior to the administration of Busulfan, followed by [CONTACT_223032] 24 hours 
after completion of the Busulfan. Anti-emetic therapy will also be started prior to Busulfan 
therapy.  
Busulfan will be administered in two doses (on Days -4 to -3 and -2 to -1 prior to the day of 
transplant which is Day 0). The first dose (3 mg/kg intravenous over 3 hours) will be given on 
Day
 -4 or -3. Blood samples to determine plasma Busulfan concentrations will be drawn at the 
following time-points: at the end of the infusion, and then 1, 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_268108] dose, in order to calculate the AUC. These samples may be drawn +/-
15 minutes of the time-point, but the actual time with reference to the administration of 
B
usulfan should be recorded to enable an accurate AUC calculation.   
The
 AUC will determine the dosage for the second dose, to target a net AUC of 4,900 µM/min 
(20 mg/l/hr). The pharmacist will calculate the AUC from the first dose based on measured 
serum levels from the PK.The second dose of Busulfan will be given intravenous ly on Day - [ADDRESS_268109] THERAPEUTICS, LTD. OTL- 101-4

drawn +/-15 minutes of the time-point, but the actual time with reference to the administration 
of 
Busulfan should be recorded to enable an accurate AUC calculation. 
C
alculation of the Busulfan dose will be based on weight at admission for transplant. See 
Section 5.1.4  for the dose calculation instructions. 
A “wash-out period” of at least 24 hours will be required between completion of the Busulfan 
infusion and administration of the OTL-101.  
Enzyme replacement therapy with PEG- ADA  
1. Immediate ERT after OTL-101 infusion  
All subjects included in the study will receive PEG-ADA (Adagen®) prior to OTL-101 
infusion, which will be continued until Day 30 ( +/-3 days) post-transplant. If, at D ay 30 ( +/-
3 days) post infusion of OTL-101, the subject is not suffering from active infections or other 
major
 medical problems, PEG-ADA administration will be discontinued.   
2. R ules for re-starting ERT or plan allogenic HSCT (if available)  
If, by 6 months after the OTL-101 infusion, there is no evidence of hematopoietic reconstitution 
following the infusion of the back up OTL-101 and rescue medication/treatment, subjects will 
require rescue PEG-ADA or allogenic HSCT if available. Positive evidence of hematopoietic 
reconstitution will require: 
a. RBC ADA >0 Units,  
b. a bsolute CD3+ T-cell counts ≥200/mm3, and  
c. pe
ripheral blood samples positive for vector sequences by [CONTACT_62865]  
(>1/10,000  cells).  
I
n addition, PEG-ADA may be re-started if the Investigator deems it in the best interests of the 
subject on clinical grounds, e.g. multiple, serious or unresponsive infections or sub-normal 
immune reconstitution. Once ERT has been re-started, the subject will remain in the study and 
will continue to be followed-up.  If the subject fails to demonstrate hematopoietic reconstitution 
and has the possibility of receiving an allogene ic transplant, the subject should be withdrawn 
from the study in order to follow institute transplantation protocols. 
Once re-started, PEG-ADA may be discontinued if all the following criteria are met: no active 
infection, PBMC ADA >6 Units, absolute CD3+ T-cell counts ≥200/mm3, and peripheral blood 
samples positive for vector sequences by [CONTACT_62865].  
Prophylaxis for Infections 
Prophylactic antimicrobial agents will be used to provide coverage for Pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia and mucosal yeast:   
- P neumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis (PJP): Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
(TMP/SMX), which will be stopped prior to CD34+ cell harvest and then resumed when 
ANC >500. If, after Day 30, ANC is <500, an alternative PJP prophylaxis regimen will 
be
 used. Suitable alternative PJP prophylactic medications include pentamidine 
(intravenous or aerosolized) or atovaquone. Dapsone should be used with caution,

be
cause of its potential myelosuppressive effects. PJP prophylaxis can be discontinued 
when CD4 >200/µl ( Griffith2009).  
- S ubjects will continue to receive prophylactic antifungal medication, such as oral 
nystatin or fluconazole in standard doses. This can be discontinued when CD4 >200/µl.  
- Additional or alternative antibiotics may be administered, based on clinical care 
considerations (these will be recorded as concomitant medications).   
Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy  
Immunoglobulin G infusions will be given according to institutional standards (e.g., 400 
to 600 mg/kg q 3-4 weeks), and in general are expected to be maintained until through IgG 
leve
ls of at least 500 mg/dL. Indications for considering the discontinuation of immunoglobulin 
replacement therapy include: absolute CD4+ >200, absolute B cell >100/µl, IgA or IgM > lower 
limit of normal for age or gene marking >1% detectable in B cells. IgG levels will be checked 
monthly to document their independence from IgG infusions. If, at least 3  months later, IgG 
levels are >300 mg/dL, the subject will undergo vaccination, which will include three doses of 
teta
nus and two to three doses of 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine, according to published 
clinical standards ( Griffith2009). Immunoglobulin G antibodies to tetanus will be determined

determined by a titer of anti-tetanus antibodies >0.15 IU/ml at least [ADDRESS_268112] developi[INVESTIGATOR_222963]-IgG and 
on antibiotic prophylaxis.   
6.2.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medication/Therapy  
It is preferable that subjects should abstain from receiving myelosuppressive medications, 
including TMP/SMX, during the peri-transplant period. However, if medications that fit this 
description are clinically warranted, and there are no viable alternatives, then the subject may 
receive the medication and will be closely monitored.  
Subjects should not enrol in any other clinical studies involving gene therapy for [ADDRESS_268113] any interactions with 
other study agents. Enrolment in other data collection, sample banking, or registry studies is 
permitted. 
6.3 Administration Compliance 
The only occasion on which the subjects will be exposed to OTL-101 is the day that they receive 
their
 genetically modified cells (Day 0) . If a subject fails to demonstrate 
engraftment/hematopo ietic reconstitution at [ADDRESS_268114]’s parents/legal guardians .

7 ASS ESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
For the timing of efficacy assessments in this study, refer to the schedule in Table 1 and Table 2. 
Thr
ee analyses will be performed during the study, which are described in Section 9.6 . 
7.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
7.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The efficacy endpoints for this study include: 
1. Eva luation of OTL-[ADDRESS_268115] based on the following parameters and 
their thresholds:  
d) Erythrocyte ADA enzyme activity above baseline/pre-treatment level ( >0 Units),  
e) A
bsolute CD3+ T-cell counts ≥ 200/mm3, and  
f) Peripheral blood samples positive for vector sequences by [CONTACT_62865](≥1/10,000 cells).  
Please note: subjects must meet all three criteria. Subjects not meeting any of these 
criteria will be designated a failure (non-responder) and will be withdrawn from the 
study ( S ection 3.6.1 ).  
The proportion of responders in this study will be compared with the proportion of 
re
sponders in one of the Phase I/II ongoing studies using the fresh formulation. 
2. Eva luate the overall survival and event free survival [ADDRESS_268116] OTL -101 infusion . 
Overall survival is defined as the proportion of subjects alive. Event -free survival  is 
defined as the proportion of subjects alive  with no “event”;  an “event” being the 
resumption of PEG -ADA ERT or the need for a rescue allogenic HSCT, or death.  
The efficacy assessments are described in S ection 7.2 . 
7.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
 Ove rall survival and event free survival [ADDRESS_268117] OTL -101 infusion.  
 Use  of immunoglobulin replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_222964].  
 P erformance outcomes and quality of life measured by [CONTACT_223002]/Lansky scale and 
questions relevant to general well -being, school attendance and ability to practice sports , 
respectively .  
 R ate of s evere infections /opportunistic infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , define d as infe ctions

7.1.3
 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
The
 following laboratory correlates of efficacy will be used to assess the level of gene 
correction, engraftment and immune reconstitution:   
 Quantification of clonal diversity of vector integrants.  
 TREC  and FACS for TCR V-beta family use. 
 P ercentage gene marking in peripheral blood cells. 
 Ade nosine deaminase enzyme activity in erythrocytes.  
 Tota l adenine nucleotides in erythrocytes. 
 Ve ctor integration analysis.  
 I mmune reconstitution 
o Absolut e Lymphocyte Count. 
o Absolut e numbers of T, B, NK lymphocytes in peripheral blood. 
o T lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogen (PHA) and to antigens (tetanus 
toxoid after vaccination)  
o S erum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA and IgM).   
The efficacy assessments are described in Section 7.2 . 
7.2 Efficacy Assessments 
The timing of assessing efficacy data are discussed in Section 5 and summarised in Table 1:  
Schedule of Events – Screening to Day 24  and Table 2:  Schedule of Events – Month 1 to Month 
24.  
Immu
ne Function 
Immune function tests will include the phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_222966], the quantification 
of immunoglobulins ((IgG, IgA, IgM) and antibodies to Tetanus toxoid, and T-cell proliferation 
to PHA.   
Ongoing T lymphopoiesis will be assessed by [CONTACT_223033]3-enriched 
c
ells (Clinical Immunology Laboratory at UCLA). 
Immune function testing will be assessed using the following endpoint assays:  
- Absolute lymphocyte counts will be determined by [CONTACT_223034]. 
-
 Absolute numbers of T, B, NK lymphocytes in peripheral blood will be determined by 
[CONTACT_4133]. 
- T lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogen (PHA) will be determined by [CONTACT_223035] (CFSE) analysis by 
[CONTACT_223034]. 
- TREC and FACS for TCR V-beta family use will be analyzed by [CONTACT_223036]3 TREC by [CONTACT_62865], and TCR Vβ family use by [CONTACT_223037].

-
 Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA and IgM) will be determined using routine 
clinical laboratory tests.   
- Serum titers of isohemagglutinin antibodies and antibodies to vaccine antigen tetanus 
toxoid will be determined by [CONTACT_223034]. 
Tests Related to the Efficacy of Gene Transfer 
The following will be measured: 
 Me asurements of erythrocyte ADA enzymatic activity and deoxyadenine nucleotides in 
RBC (RBC dAXP, RBC ADA activity), 
 Qua ntitative PCR for vector sequences will be used to measure the frequency of cells 
containing the inserted ADA gene  in PBMC and granulocyte fractions, as well as FACS-
sorted T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells when sufficient samples are 
a
vailable.  
 S erum  and PBMC samples will be used to detect RCL. 
Gene Transduction/Expression  
Percentage Gene Marking in PB cells     
The efficacy of stem cell transduction/engraftment will be determined by [CONTACT_223038]-PCR examinations of PBMC and granulocytes  in order to quantify the percentages of 
cells containing ADA cDNA. Serial samples of peripheral blood will be collected and 
fractionated to obtain leukocytes on Ficoll-Hypaque to obtain PBMC and granulocyte 
populations. Genomic DNA isolated from each cell population will be assayed for the frequency 
of cells containing the EFS- ADA LV , using qPCR. If sufficient cells are available, then the 
PBMC cells may be sub-fractionated by [CONTACT_223039] T-cells (CD3+), 
B-cells (CD19+), NK cells (CD16+/CD56+) and myeloid cells (CD13+/CD14+, or CD33+), 
and DNA from these cell sub-populations will be assayed by [CONTACT_223040]. The 
presence of transduced peripheral blood leukocytes will demonstrate transduction and 
engraftment of the genetically manipulated CD34+ cells. An absence of transduced cells will 
indicate a failure of transduction and/or engraftment. 
Clonal Diversity of Vector Integrants  
Clonal diversity will be quantified and used as an index for the numbers of vector transduced 
HSC that have engrafted in the subjects. The number of LV integration sites will be amplified 
using a modified nrLAM-PCR protocol ( Paruzynski 2010 ) and sequenced via Illumina GAIIx 
high-throughput sequencers. A custom-made software code has been written to process raw 
sequence reads and determine the genomic positions of integration sites. We expect to identify 
>1 x 10e5 integration sites per experiment, which will lend significant statistical power to 
downstream analysis.  
Adenosine deaminase Enzyme Activity in Erythrocytes  
Ade
nosine deaminase enzymatic activity in erythrocytes will be measured for all subjects at the 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved laboratory at Duke 
University under the direction of Michael Hershfield. In this laboratory, the reference range for 
ADA enzyme activity in erythrocytes from normal donors is defined. Actual levels of ADA 
enzyme activity, and the attainment of sufficient enzyme levels within the normal reference 
ORCHARD THERAPEUTICS, LTD. OTL- 101-4

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 68/130 
 
ra
nge, and similar to those of the normal population with functional immune systems, will be 
recorded.  
Total Adenine Nucleotides in Erythrocytes  
The levels of deoxyadenine nucleotides in erythrocytes will be determined at each time point 
(at the laboratory headed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michael Hershfield, Duke University). The level of 
deoxyadenine nucleotides in erythrocytes provides an indirect assessment of systemic 
detoxification by [CONTACT_223041]. While not a primary study endpoint, this parameter 
will be measured to provide additional information on the effects of the procedure.  
Quality of Life  
An assessment will be made of general quality of life and neurological development accor ding 
to 
the schedule of events tables. During these visits, the impact of illness on health-related 
quality of life will be determined using the Karnofsky/Lansky performance scale (which is 
recommended for immune deficiencies and transplanted patients) (see Section 17: Appendix 
2).  
Questions relevant to general well-being, school attendance and ability to practice sports, will 
also be posed to the subject and his/her parents/legal guardians by [CONTACT_737]. These 
que
stions will form part of the eCRF.   Questions suitable/relevant to the age of the subject will 
be posed. 
Infections 
Although infections are safety evaluations, in ADA-SCID, they are also a clear feature of the 
disease. Evaluation of the frequency of severe infections or opportunistic infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_222967] (immune-reconstitution). This is defined as 
infections or severe infections requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222941]/or

to safety: 
 Gr ade  3/4 procedure-related AEs, including GvHD.  
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_222968].  
 C linical laboratory toxicities, including myelosuppression, abnormal blood cell counts 
and/or biochemistry parameters, according to AE grading scale described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 Toxicity related to the use of LV, specifically the emergence of replication competent 
lentivirus or monoclonal expansion or leukemia, due to vector insertion. 
The safety assessments are described in Se ction 8.[ADDRESS_268120]’s parents/legal 
guardians provide informed consent and then throughout the study (see Section 3.5  for 
definition of the study duration) and will be elicited by [CONTACT_67494], non-leading questioning or if 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423]/parent/legal guardian. Further details on AE reporting 
can be found in Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_268121]. An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies an AE 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run in or washout 
periods, even if no OTL-101 has been administered. 
De
ath due to disease progression will be recorded as part of the efficacy evaluation (due to 
failure of the OTL-[ADDRESS_268122] ) and will be regarded as an SAE unrelated to OTL-101.

[IP_ADDRESS]
 Causality Classification 
The relationship between an AE and study product administration will be classified according 
to the following:  
Related : reports that contain good reasons and sufficient information (e.g. plausible time 
sequence, dose response relationship, pharmacology, positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge) 
to assume a causal relationship with OTL-101 administration in the sense that it is plausible, 
c
onceivable or likely.  
Not related : reports that contain good reasons and sufficient information (e.g. implausible tim e 
sequence and/or attributable to concurrent disease or other drugs) to rule out a causal 
relationship with OTL-101 administration. 
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Assessment of Expectedness  
The reference document used to assess the expectedness of AEs in this study will be the current 
IB.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
Abnormalities in laboratory test values should only be reported as AEs if any of the following 
apply:  
 The y result in a delay of the OTL-101 treatment or other study procedures, 
 The y require an intervention or diagnostic evaluation to assess the risk to the subject,  
 The y are considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_737]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Physical Examination Findings  
In the judgment of the Investigator, clinically significant changes to the findings of physical 
e
xaminations (abnormalities) will be recorded as AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Investigation Abnormal Findings 
Abnormal test findings judged by [CONTACT_16426] (e.g. ECG, echo 
changes) and that require an intervention or diagnostic evaluation to assess the risk to the 
subject, should be recorded as AEs. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_268123] (or parent/legal guardian) should be asked a non- leading 
question such as: “How have you felt since transplantation (or last visit)?” All observed or 
voluntarily reported AEs, regardless of their potential causal relationship with OTL-101, will 
be
 recorded on the AE page(s) of the eCRF. Events involving drug reactions, accidents,

NFIDENTIAL 
  
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 71/130 
 
il
lnesses with onset during the study, or exacerbations of pre-existing illnesses should be 
recorded. Any AEs already recorded and designated as ‘continuing’ should be reviewed at each 
subsequent assessment.  
Any AEs reported at visits to the subject’s general practitioner must be transmitted by [CONTACT_223042], if possible on the same day, 
so that they can be recorded in the eCRF, notified to the Sponsor (if an SAE), and followed up 
a
ppropriately by [CONTACT_223043].  
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information that is adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as 
an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated representative. For all 
AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_223044] (i.e. protocol treatment or other illness). The Investigator is required to 
assess causality and record that assessment on the eCRF. Follow up of the AE, after the date of 
OTL-[ADDRESS_268124]. Follow up is required until the 
e
vent or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a value acceptable to the Investigator and the 
Sponsor’s clinical monitor or his/her designated representative. 
8.2.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs (as defined below) regardless of the suspected relationship to OTL -101, must be 
re
ported immediately (within 24  hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event) to the 
pharmacovigilance contact [CONTACT_223045]. If the immediate report 
is submitted by [CONTACT_756], this must be followed by [CONTACT_223046].  
For subjects who are not geographically close to the clinical site who are clinically stable, post-
transplant care may be transferred to the home physician provided the identified clinician agrees 
to assume this post-transplant monitoring. Any discharge from the clinical site and re-admission 
to the local site (second facility) would not meet the criteria for being reported as a serious 
adverse event.  
An SAE is any AE that:  
- Results in death,  
- Is life threatening, that is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death,  
- Results of in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
excluding admission for social or administrative reasons (see below),  
- Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, where disability is a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions,  
- Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received 
OTL-101,  
-
 Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm

re
quiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
In addition to the above criteria, any additional AE that the Sponsor or an Investigator considers 
serious should be reported immediately to the Sponsor and included in the corporate SAE 
database system.  
- Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222969]-patient admission (even if less than 24  hours). For 
chronic or long term in-patients, in-patient admission also includes transfer within the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care in-patient unit.  
- Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222970]-patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222971]/required in relation to the original reason for 
the initial admission, as determined by [CONTACT_68480]. For 
protocol specified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222972], prolongation is defined as any 
extension beyond the length of stay described in the protocol. Prolongation in the 
absence of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment emergent, clinical AE (i.e. not associated with the 
development of a new AE or worsening of a pre-existing condition) may meet criteria 
for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience and thus is not subject to immediate 
reporting to the Sponsor.  
-
 Preplanned or elective treatments/surgical procedures should be noted in the subject’ s 
screening documentation. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preplanned or elective treatment/surgical 
procedure should not be reported as an SAE unless there are complications or sequelae 
which meet the criteria for seriousness as described above.  
Any SAE must be reported immediately (within 24 hours), independent of the circumstances 
or suspected cause, if it occurs or comes to the attention of the Investigator at any time during 
the study period.  
Any AE/SAE with a suspected causal relationship to OTL-[ADDRESS_268125] be provided to Sponsor’s pharmacovigilance contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours 
for each SAE:  
- Study number  
- Center number  
- Subject number  
- AE  
- Investigator's name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_223047]. The Investigator should always provide an 
a
ssessment of causality for each event reported to the Sponsor. Upon receipt of the initial report, 
the Sponsor will ask for the Investigator's causality assessment if it was not provided with the 
initial report.  
The Investigator  should report a diagnosis or a syndrome rather than individual signs or 
symptoms. The Investigator should also try to separate a primary AE considered as the foremost 
untoward medical occurrence from secondary AEs which occurred as complications.

 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_222973]-101 has interfered 
with 
a contraceptive method. If pregnancy occurs during the study, the outcome of the 
pregnancy will then need to be collected (post-study if necessary).  
The subjects recruited into this study are under the age of [ADDRESS_268126] will be performed on 
all female subjects of childbearing potential at screening, baseline/pre-conditioning assessment, 
before the administration of Busulfan, and before the administration of OTL-101. For females 
of 
child-bearing potential in whom preventive measures fail, pregnancies will be reported as 
indicated below.  
In the event of any pregnancy reported in a participant no protocol treatment will be 
administered. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study, before the administration 
of Busulfan or before the administration of OTL-101, will be withdrawn. 
I
nformation regarding pregnancies must be collected on the AE page of the eCRF and reported 
to the Sponsor as an SAE. The Sponsor will request further information from the Investigator 
as to the course and outcome of the pregnancy.  
The Investigator must instruct all female subjects of reproductive age to use a medically 
approved method of contraception throughout study participation. The Investigator must also 
instruct all female/male subjects of reproductive age to inform them immediately should they/or 
their partner become pregnant during the study. The Investigator should counsel the subject, 
discuss the risks of a pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the 
subject/the partner should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy, which may involve 
follow up after the subject’s involvement in the study has ended.  
If the Investigator becomes aware of a pregnancy occurring in the partner of a subject 
pa
rticipating in the study, this should be reported to the Sponsor. After the partner has given 
written consent, she should be counselled and followed as described above. Monitoring of the 
partner should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_268127] be reported as an SAE within 24 hours 
of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
The
 convention for recording death is as follows:  
 Adverse event term: lead cause of death (e.g. multiple organ failure, pneumonia, 
myocardial infarction), 
 Outcome: fatal. 
The only exception  is if the cause of death is unknown (i.e. sudden or unexplained death), in 
which case the AE term may be ‘Death’ or ‘Sudden death’.  
8.2.6 Discontinuation/Withdrawal due to Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
Discontinuation/withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from discontinuation/ 
withdrawal due to an insufficient response to OTL-101.

8.2.7 Reporting to Competent Authorities/IECs/IRBs/Other Investigators  
The Sponsor will ensure that processes are in place for the submission of reports of Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) occurring during the study to the CA, 
IEC/IRB and other Investigators concerned by [CONTACT_223048]-101. Reporting will be done in accordan ce 
with t

For the single study center in the US, S[LOCATION_003]Rs and other important safety reports, when 
appropriate, will be submitted directly to the Investigators. It is the responsibility of 
I
nvestigators to notify their IEC/IRB and the FDA in a timely manner. 
8.3
 Physical Examination 
Physical examinations, including weight (kg) and body height (cm) will be conducted at times 
indicated in Ta ble 1 and Ta ble 2. 
Any clinically significant physical examination findings (abnormalities) observed during the 
study will be reported as AEs. Any physical examination findings (abnormalities) persisting at 
the
 end of the study will be followed by [CONTACT_223049] a

 He ad, including ears, eyes, nose, throat, if feasible.  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  
 C ardiovascular  
 Abdome n (including liver and kidneys)  
 Ne urological examination with sensory testing

A 
twelve-lead ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec so that the different ECG 
intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT) can be measured manually/automatically. The ECG will be 
recorded [with the subject in supi[INVESTIGATOR_222974]] until four regular 
consecutive complexes are available. Automated ECG interval estimates taken from the ECG 
recorder will be used in this study.  
Any clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded as AEs. 
8.6 Laboratory Safety Tests 
Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology, and a urine sample for urinalysis will be 
taken for evaluation of laboratory safety parameters listed in Table 3 according to the times 
indi
cated in Table 1 and Ta ble 2. All clinical laboratory assays will be performed according to 
the relevant laboratory’s normal procedures. Reference ranges will be supplied by [CONTACT_223050]-of-range 
pathological changes.  
For the evaluation of hematology and biochemistry panels, and urinalysis, the Investigator will 
review the safety laboratory test results, document the review, and record any clinically relevant 
changes occurring or observed during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. Changes 
compared to pre-harvest tests will be recorded as AEs if they are considered to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_737]. 
All clinically relevant abnormal laboratory tests occurring during the study will be repeated at 
appropriate intervals until they return to baseline or to a value deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_80468]’s clinical monitor (or his/her designated representative) or until 
the abnormality is explained by [CONTACT_223051].

9 S TATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 Background 
The primary objective of this clinical study is to further explore the safety and efficacy of 
OTL-101, an autologous, genetically modified CD34+ HSC based gene therapy for the 
treatment of ADA-SCID. The study will also be supportive of the analytical CMC 
comparability studies between fresh and cryopreserved OTL-101 formulations. The clinical 
outcome
s (good predictors of survival and event free survival) : RBC ADA >0 Units, absolute 
CD3+ T-cell counts ≥ 200/mm3, and peripheral blood samples positive for vector sequences by 
[CONTACT_62865](>1/10,000 cells) will be assessed as part of an interim analysis following completion of 
the [ADDRESS_268134] OTL-101 infusion, will be performed in support of CMC 
assessing comparability between cryopreserved and fresh formulations. Evaluation of the 
success of therapy will be based on the following parameters and their thresholds: 
a) Erythrocyte ADA enzyme activity above baseline/pre-treatment level ( >0 Units),  
b) Absolute CD3+ T-cell counts ≥ 200/mm3, and  
c) Peripheral blood samples positive for vector sequences by [CONTACT_62865](≥1/10,000 cells).  
Tr
eatment will be deemed sucessful in subjects meeting all three above thresholds.  These 
subjects will be designated as “responders”. Those subjects failing to meet at least one of the 
a
bove thresholds will be considered to be “non-responders.” 
Overall Survival is defined as the time-to death from the OTL-[ADDRESS_268135]’ s 
data will be considered censored at the last evaluation.  
Event Free Survival is defined as the time-to event from the OTL-[ADDRESS_268136]’s data will be considered censored at the last evaluation. Event is  defined 
a
s any of the following:  
 De ath  
 Returning to PEG-ADA ERT

 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
The
 following laboratory correlates of efficacy will be used to assess the level of gene 
correction, engraftment and immune reconstitution:   
 Quantification of clonal diversity of vector integrants.  
 TREC  and FACS for TCR V-beta family use. 
 P ercentage gene marking in peripheral blood cells. 
 Ade nosine deaminase enzyme activity in erythrocytes.  
 Tota l adenine nucleotides in erythrocytes.  
 Ve ctor integration analysis.

toxoid after vaccination)  
o Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA and IgM). 
All summari es of exploratory endpoints will be descriptive. 
9.3.4
 Safety Endpoints  
Safety endpoints in this study are AEs, including SAEs, with severity graded by [CONTACT_223054] (CTCAE) criteria, including relation to treatment. 
Special attention will be paid to the following AE types: 
1. Clinical toxicities  
2. Exposure to RCL

3. De velopment of monoclonal expansion or leukoproliferative complications from vector 
insertional effects.  
9.4 Sample Size Considerations 
Due to the ultra-orphan nature of this indication, the sample size for this study is based on 
practical considerations. Specifically, the number of ADA-SCID patients expected to meet 
eligibility criteria yearly is around four to five. With a planned enrollment of three to six 
subjects per year, the sample size (N=10) for this study is considered reasonable.  
It should be noted that the sample size will provide precision of 15% for 100% success 
(survival) at any particular time point. Precision is here defined as the half-width of the two-
sided 95% CI using the Exact Binomial computations.  
Ten subjects receiving OTL-[ADDRESS_268139] and gene therapy use RBC ADA enzyme activity >0 U, absolute CD3+ T-cell counts 
≥200/mm3, and peripheral blood samples positive for vector sequences by [CONTACT_62865] 
(>1/10,000 cells) as  predictors of survival and event free survival and ultimately the success of 
the OTL-[ADDRESS_268140] one dose of Busulfan 
and for whom there are sufficient plasma samples to allow reliable determination of PK profile. 
Subjects' evaluability will be determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
9.6 Statistical Methods 
9.6.1 Overview  
Full statistical methods will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The data will be 
summarized in tables displaying the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum 
and number of subjects for continuous data (e.g. age, weight) or in tables displaying count and 
percentage for categorical data (e.g. gender, previous treatment). Data will be presented by 
[CONTACT_765], if applicable.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS)® Version 
9.4. or higher.

relationship to treatment and TEAEs associated with premature withdrawal from the study.  
A TEAE is defined as any AE that occurs during the active phase of the study if:  
• it was not present prior to receiving the OTL-101 infusion, or  
• it  was present prior to receiving the OTL-101 infusion but the intensity increased during 
the active phase of the study, or  
• it  was present prior to receiving theOTL-101 infusion, the intensity is the same but the 
drug relationship became related during the active phase of the study.  
Summary statistics (mean, median, SD and range as appropriate) will be presented for vital 
signs, ECG parameters and clinical laboratory tests at each assessment along with change from 
baseline. For laboratory data, abnormal values will be flagged in the data listings. Shift tables 
will be presented of the number and percentage of subjects with low, normal or high values and 
normal or abnormal examinations at each visit and overall.

11 QUALIT Y CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
11.1 Protocol Amendments 
11.1.1 Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and CAs, except when 
this is necessary to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the subjects or when the change 
involves only logistics or administration. The principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_222975].  
In the event that an amendment to this protocol is required, it will be classified into one of the 
following three categories: 
Administrational changes are those that are not considered ‘substantial’ (e.g. administrative 
changes) and as such are not required to be notified to the IEC/IRB or CAs but are contained 
in the protocol under a subsequent notification of a substantial amendment.  
S
ubstantial Amendments  are those considered ‘substantial’ to the conduct of the clinical study 
where they are likely to have a significant impact on: 
- the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects, 
- the scientific value of the study, 
- the conduct or management of the study, or 
- the quality or safety of the protocol treatment used in the study. 
S
ubstantial amendments must be notified to the IEC/IRB and CAs. Prior to implementation, 
documente
d approval must be received from the IEC/IRB and either explicit approval or no 
raise of grounds of non-acceptance during the regulatory review period (country specific) must 
be received from the relevant CAs. 
Ur
gent Amendments  are those that require urgent safety measures to protect the study subjects 
from immediate hazard and as such may be implemented immediately by [CONTACT_223059]/IRB and CAs notification, forthwith.  
11.1.2
 Protocol Deviations, Violations, and Exceptions  
A protocol deviation concerns non-compliance with protocol-specific study procedures or 
schedules that do not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective evaluation criteria, 
and/or GCP guidelines. Such deviations are considered to be minor and do not impact the study.  
A protocol violation is any clinically significant divergence from the protocol, i.e. non-
compliance by [CONTACT_423], the Investigator, or the Sponsor with protocol-specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective evaluation criteria, and/or GCP guidelines. 
Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by [CONTACT_223060], in the eCRF.  
As a matter of policy, the Sponsor will not grant any exemptions from the protocol-specific 
entry criteria in order to allow subjects to enter a study. If, under extraordinary circumstances, 
such an action is considered ethically, medically and scientifically justified for a particular 
subject, prior approval from the Sponsor and the responsible IEC/IRB is required before the 
subject will be allowed to enter the study. If staff at an investigational center learn that a subject 
who did not meet the protocol eligibility criteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation), 
they must inform the Sponsor immediately. Such subjects will be withdrawn from the study,

and during the course of the study (e.g. when new staff become involved). The Investigator 
must ensure that all study staff members are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience and training to 
carry out their specific responsibilities. These study staff members must be listed on the study 
center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff member’ s 
responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary.  
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including the 
Investigator, and for ensuring their compliance with the protocol. Additional information will 
be made available during the study when new staff become involved in the study and as 
otherwise agreed with either the Investigator or the study monitor.

 Study Monitoring 
The Investigator is responsible for the validity of all data collected at the site.  
The
 Sponsor is responsible for monitoring this data to verify that the rights and well-being of 
subjects are protected, that study data are accurate (complete and verifiable to source data) and 
that the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and regulatory 
requirements.  
11.[ADDRESS_268149] operating procedures (SOPs), the 
protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. 
Sponsor assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits according to the monitoring plan . 
The Investigator will allow direct access to all relevant files (for all subjects) and clinical study 
supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for the purpose of verifying entries made in the eCRF, 
and will assist with the monitor’s activities, if requested. Adequate time and space for 
monitoring visits should be made available by [CONTACT_737].  
The site must complete the eCRFs according to the Sponsor's monitoring manual with respect 
to all visits by [CONTACT_223062] (within a maximum 5 days) to enable their 
regular review by [CONTACT_11200], both remotely via the internet and during site visits. The 
study monitors will use functions of the EDC system to address any queries that arise while 
reviewing the data entered by [CONTACT_26271], in a timely manner.  
Whenever a subject's name [CONTACT_29704] a document required by [CONTACT_1034] (e.g. laboratory

As part of the supervision of study progress, other Sponsor personnel may, upon request, 
accompany the study monitor on visits to the study centre. The Investigator and assisting staff 
must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or possible 
misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring visits.

Authorised personnel from external CAs and the Sponsor’s authorised Quality Assurance 
personnel or nominated representative (CRO) may carry out inspections and audits. 
11.6
 Data Quality Assurance 
Monitored eCRFs transferred from the investigational site to the assigned Data Management 
group will be reviewed (secondary monitoring) for completeness, consistency, legibility and 
protocol compliance. 
Reasons should be given on the relevant eCRF for any missing data and other protocol deviations. 
Any electronic queries and items not adequately explained will require additional electronic 
manual queries to be raised to the Investigator by [CONTACT_223064]/correction. The 
Investigator must ensure that queries are dealt with promptly. All data changes and clarifications 
can be viewed in the audit trail function of the eCRF. 
The handling of data, including data quality assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines 
(e.g., ICH and GCP) and the Sponsor’s SOPs and working instructions. Data management and 
control processes specific to this study will be described in a data management plan. All steps 
and actions taken regarding data management and quality assurance will be documented in a 
data handling report.  
The Sponsor will implement edit checks on the eCRF to enforce data entry guidelines, data 
consistency, and compliance to the protocol and regulatory requirements. The Study centre 
coordinator(s) will be responsible for entering study data on the eCRFs. Data management will 
track eCRFs and review them for completeness, the presence of mandatory values, consistency, 
and dated electronic signatures. In addition to checking for source data verification flags, data 
management will electronically attach data clarification queries directly onto the eCRFs during 
the review process to ensure data quality. Once study centre personnel have provided acceptable 
responses to the queries and implemented the changes on the eCRFs, data management will 
close the queries with the appropriate resolution status. 
During the study the database will be locked for the interim analysis (first five subjects at the 
6-month visit), 12-month (primary) analysis and the 24-month analysis at the end of study. The 
da
ta will be released for reporting and statistical analysis.

12 E THICS 
12.1 Compliance with Good Clinical Practice and Ethical Considerations 
This study will be conducted in compliance with IEC/IRB, local regulation for informed 
consent/assent, the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP Guidelines. 
The
 EDC system will comply with FDA, 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic Records, Electronic 
Signatures, and FDA, Guidance for Industry: Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials.  
In addition, this study will adhere to all local regulatory requirements.  
Before initiating a study, the Investigator/institution must have obtained written and dated 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_54053]/IRB for the study protocol/amendment(s), written 
informed consent forms, any consent form updates, subject emergency study contact [CONTACT_114376], 
subject recruitment procedures (e.g. advertisements), any written information to be provided to 
subjects and a statement from the IEC/IRB that they comply with GCP requirements. The 
IEC/IRB approval must identify the protocol version as well as the documents reviewed.  
After IEC/IRB approval, changes will require a formal amendment. Once the study has started, 
amendments should only be made in exceptional circumstances. Changes that do not affect 
subject safety or data integrity are classified as administrative changes and generally do not 
require ethical approval. If ethically relevant aspects are concerned, the IEC/IRB must be 
informed and, if necessary, approval sought prior to implementation. Ethical approval of 
administrative changes will be obtained if required by [CONTACT_5737]/site IEC/IRB.

consent/assent forms for the parents/legal guardians and subjects to read and sign. The final 
version controlled form must be agreed by [CONTACT_1034], and the IEC/IRB and must contain all 
elements included in the sample form, in language readily understood by [CONTACT_423]. A signed 
a
nd dated informed consent form will be obtained from each parent/legal guardian and a signed 
and dated assent form will be obtained from each subject (according to local regulations) before 
any study specific procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated 
benefits, and potential hazards are explained, according to local IEC/IRB requirements. 
Sufficient time must be allowed to discuss any questions raised by [CONTACT_48647]/legal 
guardians.  
The Investigator will keep the original consent/assent forms and copi[INVESTIGATOR_222976]/legal guardians. It will also be explained to the subjects and their 
parents/legal guardians that they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw 
from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment. 
The consent/assent form(s) may need to be revised during the study should important new 
information become available that may be relevant to the safety of the subject or as a result of 
protocol amendments. In this instance, approval should always be given by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB. It is 
the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that all subjects and the subject’s parents/legal 
g
uardians (including those subsequently entered into the study and those currently in the study) 
sign the amended form. This is documented in the same way as previously described. Subjects

12.3
 Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review 
Boards 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Sponsor’s Regulatory Affairs group will ensure all legal 
regulatory aspects are covered, and obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory bodies prior 
to study initiation in regions where such an approval is required.  
Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national/local health authorities 
and to each IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start [at a given centre] before 
the IEC/IRB and health authority (where applicable) for the centre give written approval or a 
favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_222977]-acceptance within the review 
timeframe. 
12.[ADDRESS_268151] assure that the privacy of the subjects, including their personal identity 
and all personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In eCRFs and other 
documents or image materials submitted to the Sponsor, the subjects will be identified not by 
[CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_1209] (e.g. initials and identification number).  
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purposes of verifying data recorded in 
the eCRF. This review may be conducted by [CONTACT_11200], properly authorized persons 
acting on behalf of the Sponsor, the quality assurance unit, or regulatory authorities. Personal 
medical information will always be treated as confidential.

13.1 Data Recording of Study Data 
In compliance with GCP, all medical records/medical notes, etc., should be clearly marked and 
permit easy identification of a subject’s participation in the specified clinical study. The 
Investigator must record all data relative to protocol procedures, study product administration, 
laboratory data, safety data and efficacy ratings in the eCRFs provided for the study. The 
Investigator, by [CONTACT_223065], may formally designate authority to complete 
eCRFs to appropriately qualified staff having certified user access to the eCRF. Questionnaires 
completed by [CONTACT_223066].  
The Investigator must, as a minimum, provide an electronic signature (e-signature) for each 
case report book so as to attest to the accuracy and completeness of all the data. If any changes 
are made to the eCRF once a form has been locked and electronically signed, the Investigator 
will be required to approve an additional e-signature [CONTACT_223105]/her agreement with any new 
information or changes to the eCRF. All corrections in the eCRF will be automatically tracked 
and a reason for any change is always required. In the eCRF, the audit trail function will allow 
the changes made to be viewed on each item entered. 
13.[ADDRESS_268153] successfully completed software application training prior to 
entering data in the eCRF.  
Data management will be performed by a CRO. All data management procedures will be carried 
out in accordance with the contracted CRO's SOPs. Prior to data being received in-house by [CONTACT_223067], they will be monitored at the Investigator site, (for further details please see 
Section 11.3 ). The eCRF and other data documentation removed from the Investigator site(s) 
will be tracked by [CONTACT_223068].  
The Sponsor will ensure that an appropriate eCRF is developed to capture the data accurately, 
and that suitable queries are raised to resolve any missing or inconsistent data. The Investigator 
will receive data from the clinical study in an electronic format (PDF files) that will be an exact 
copy of the eCRF and will include the full audit trail, for archiving purposes and future 
reference. 
Any queries generated during the data management process will also be tracked by [CONTACT_223069]/will be raised within the EDC system. It is the central study monitor’s 
responsibility to ensure that all queries are resolved by [CONTACT_223070]. 
The Sponsor will also ensure that SAE data collected in the eCRF are consistent with 
information provided to the Sponsor’s pharmacovigilance department (and vice versa).  
The coding of an AE, medical history and concomitant medication terms will be performed by [CONTACT_223071], directed by [CONTACT_1689], and reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1034] .

13.2.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
All records related to the study (i.e. source data, source documents, CRFs (see Section 10 ), 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_222978], drug accountability forms, correspondence, 
subject identification lists, signed informed consent forms, and other essential documents) must 
be retained until the Sponsor notifies the institution, in writing, that records may be destroyed.   
If the Sponsor has not provided written notification of records destruction after 10 years from 
study completion (or earlier in the case of an institution closing), and the institution determines 
the study record retention is unduly burdensome, the institution may submit a written request 
to the Sponsor at least 60 days before the planned disposition of the study records. No study 
document or image (e.g. scan, radiograph, ECG tracing) should be destroyed without prior 
written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to 
assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, advance written 
notice will be given to the Sponsor. 
13.2.2
 Sponsor Responsibilities  
The
 Sponsor will be responsible for the processing and quality control of the data.  Data 
management and filing will be carried out as described in the Sponsor’s SOPs for clinical 
studies. 
If data management and filing for this study are delegated to a contract organization, these 
functions will be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at that organization.  
These SOPs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_223072]. 
The original CRFs will be archived by [CONTACT_121190] 30 years (according with gene therapy 
traceability requirement) . If eCRFs are used in the study, electronic images will be archived by 
[CONTACT_1034]. Centre specific eCRF images will be sent to the study centre for archiving. 
13.[ADDRESS_268154] ensure that the archiving facilities 
are adequate and the archiving/retention responsibilities of the Investigator have been 
discussed.  
Study documents should be retained for at least [ADDRESS_268155] approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or planned marketing 
applications in an ICH region (that is at least 15 years), or at least [ADDRESS_268156]. However, these documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_223073]. The Investigator should take measures to prevent any 
accidental or premature destruction of these documents. The final archiving arrangements will 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_223074]. The Sponsor will inform the 
Investigator, in writing, as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
If the principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_222979], or otherwise withdraws his/her responsibility 
for the maintenance and retention of study documents, the Sponsor must be notified (preferably 
in writing) so that adequate provision can be made for their future maintenance and retention.

INTRODUC
TION  
The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) oversees clinical trials throughout the world which it sponsors 
and supports.  The clinical trials evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic products, vaccines, 
and other preventive modalities.  Adverse event (AE) data collected during these clinical trials 
form the basis for subsequent safety and efficacy analyses of pharmaceutical products and medical 
devices.  Incorrect and inconsistent AE severity grading can lead to inaccurate data analyses and 
interpretation, which in turn can impact the safety and well-being of clinical trial participants and 
future patients using pharmaceutical products.  
The DAIDS AE grading table is a shared tool for assessing the severity of AEs (including clinical 
and laboratory abnormalities) in participants enrolled in clinical trials.  Over the years as scientific 
knowledge and experience have expanded, revisions to the DAIDS AE grading table have become 
necessary.  
The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse  
Ev
ents, Version 2.[ADDRESS_268178] DAIDS clinical trial data in revising certain hematology parameters (i.e., 
hemoglobin, white cell counts, and absolute neutrophil counts).  DAIDS also took into 
consideration the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s guidance regarding the use of local 
laboratory reference values and ethnic differences among certain healthy adolescent and adult 
populations in defining parameter limits.  Finally, the revised DAIDS AE grading table also 
contains an updated glossary and acronyms section, expanded instructions for use section, and an 
a
ppendix that provides more age-specific information for an AE of concern to DAIDS.  
DAIDS is grateful to the DAIDS Grading Table Working Group, numerous government and non-
g
overnment affiliated medical subject matter experts and reviewers who were instrumental in the 
revision of the DAIDS AE grading table.  
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The Division of AIDS  (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events, Version 2.0  consists of parameters, or AEs, with severity grading guidance that are to be 
used in DAIDS clinical trials for safety data reporting to maintain accuracy and consistency in the 
evaluation of AEs.  The term “severe” is not the same as the term “serious” in classifying AEs.  
The severity of a specific event describes its intensity, and it is the intensity which is graded.  
Seriousness, which is not graded, relates to an outcome of an AE and is a regulatory definition.  
Clinical sites are encouraged to report parameters in the DAIDS AE grading table as they are 
written to maintain data consistency across clinical trials.  However, since some parameters can 
be reported with more specificity, clinical sites are encouraged to report parameters that convey

a
dditional clinical information.  For example, diarrhea could be reported as neonatal diarrhea; 
seizures, as febrile seizures; and pain, as jaw pain. 
The DAIDS AE grading table provides an AE severity grading scale ranging from grades 1 to 5 
with descriptions for each AE based on the following general guidelines:   
• Gr ade 1 indicates a mild event  
• Gr ade 2 indicates a moderate event  
• Gr ade 3 indicates a severe event  
• Gr ade 4 indicates a potentially life-threatening event  
• Gr ade 5 indicates death ( Note : This grade is not specifically listed on each page of the grading 
table).  
Other points to consider include:  
• Use  parameters defined by [CONTACT_223080].  
• Ma le and female sex are defined at birth.  
• Unle ss noted, laboratory values are for term neonates.  Preterm neonates should be assessed 
using local laboratory normal ranges.  
• W here applicable, Standard International (SI) units are included in italics.  
S
ELECTING AND REPORTING A PRIMARY AE TERM  
When selecting a primary AE term to report, sites should select the term that best describes what 
occurred to the participant.  For example, a participant may present with itching, urticaria, flushing, 
angioedema of the face, and dyspnea.  If the underlying diagnosis is determined to be an acute 
allergic reaction, sites should report “Acute Allergic Reaction” as the primary AE term.  
Primary AE terms should be reported using the DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System 
(DAERS) only if they meet expedited reporting criteria.  However, all primary AE terms should 
be reported using protocol-specific case report forms (CRFs).  Because the reported information 
is stored in different databases (i.e., safety and clinical), sites should report primary AE terms using 
the same terminology for data consistency.   
When reporting using DAERS, other clinically significant events associated with a primary AE 
term that more fully describe the nature, severity, or complications of the primary AE term should 
be entered in the “Other Events” section.  However, the severity grade for these events must be 
lower than or equal to the severity grade of the primary AE term.  In the example above, dyspnea 
and angioedema of the face may be entered in the “Other Events” section, because they are more 
descriptive and provide additional information on the severity of the acute allergic reaction.  
However, their severity grades must be lower than or equal to the severity grade of the primary 
AE term of “Acute Allergic Reaction”.

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT4 : VERSION 5.0, 28 MARCH 2018 PAGE 109/[ADDRESS_268179] in the reporting and recording of information (e.g., signs and symptoms, 
clinically significant events) in DAERS and CRFs.  Therefore, sites should refer to their protocols 
and CRF requirements for further instructions.   
GRADING ADULT AND PEDIATRIC AES  
When a single parameter is not appropriate for grading an AE in both adult and pediatric 
populations, separate parameters with specified age ranges are provided.  If no distinction  between 
adult and pediatric populations has been made, the listed parameter should be used for grading an 
AE in both populations.  
REPORTING PREGNANCY OUTCOMES  
In the Pregnancy, Puerperium, and Perinatal  section, all parameters are pregnancy outcomes and 
should be reported using the mother's participant ID.  If an infant is not enrolled in the same study 
as the mother, any identified birth defects should be reported using the mother's participant ID.  
However, if an infant is enrolled in the same study as the mother or in another study, any identified 
birth defects should be reported using the infant's participant ID.  Sites should refer to the 
applicable network standards for reporting abnormal pregnancy outcomes on the CRFs.  
DETERMINING SEVERITY GRADE FOR PARAMETERS BETWEEN GRADES   
If the severity of an AE could fall in either one of two grades (i.e., the severity of an AE could be 
either grade 2 or grade 3), sites should select the higher of the two grades.  
LABORATORY VALUES  
General. An asymptomatic, abnormal laboratory finding without an accompanying AE should not 
be reported to DAIDS in an expedited timeframe unless it meets protocol-specific reporting 
requirements.  Sites should refer to the applicable network standards for reporting abnormal 
laboratory findings on the CRFs.    
Value
s below Grade 1.  Any laboratory value that is between the ULN and grade 1 (for high values) 
or the LLN and grade 1 (for low values) should not be graded or reported as an AE.  Sites should 
consult the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to DAIDS, Version 2.0  and their 
protocol when making an assessment of the need to report an AE.  
Overlap of Local Laboratory Normal Values with Grading Table Ranges .  When local laboratory 
normal values fall within grading table laboratory ranges, the severity grading is based on the 
ranges in the grading table unless there is a protocol-specific grading criterion for the laboratory 
value.  For example, “Magnesium, Low" has a grade 1 range of 1.2 to < 1.4 mEq/L, while a 
particular laboratory’s normal range for magnesium may be 1.3 to 2.8 mEq/L.  If a study 
participant’s magnesium laboratory value is 1.3 mEq/L, the laboratory value should be graded as 
grade 1.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY   
STUDY number:  OTL -101-4 
Protocol Amendment 1, Version 2.0: 18 January  2017  
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The purpose of protocol amendment 1 (18 January 2017) is to provide furt her clarity on 
procedures, align consistent language and terms throughout  the document , and provide 
flexibility for blood sample volume due to the age of the subjects to be treated under the 
protocol.  
This document will summarise the key changes accordingly:  
1. Baseline immune function tests can be performed following consent/assent and prior 
to conditioning for subjects (particularly infants) where blood volume is restricted per 
visit. The window for screening assessments has also been aligned with standard 
practice to permit prior assessments to be used within [ADDRESS_268241] -transplant.  
3. The protocol has been updated in terms of current available information on the 
disease, current treatment options, trial details for the OTL -101 program, and 
permitted concomitant medication (including risks and benefits) . 
4. Language consistency applied throughout the document:  
o Age of subject s eligible for inclusion,  
o Quality of life tools to be used (with an added statement to apply age appropriate 
tools),  
o Hema topoietic  instead of immune  reconstitution , 
o Removal of “possible RT -PCR” from gene transduction assessment  
o Duplicate text removed.  
5. Further details are provided regarding the bone marr ow harvesting procedures and the 
requirement to obtain a back -up sample at bone marrow harvest . Further clarification 
on when to use the back -up sample and the withdrawal of subjects from the study if 
there is no evidence of hematopoietic reconstitution.   
6. Busulfan pharmacokinetic data description is removed from the second analysis.  
7. Further clarification of OTL -[ADDRESS_268242] storage and administration. Dose calculation 
forms (single and multi -bag) have been appended to the protocol for ease of use by [CONTACT_223083]. In addition,  an accountability log is provided in the appendix to ensure 
adequate recording and verification of OTL -[ADDRESS_268243] (regardless of 
reason) will be included in the intention -to-treat population .   
10. Administrative changes and typographical errors  (which are not shown in the table 
below) .

Risks Related to 
Concomitant 
Therapy  Busulf an 
Busulfan is used for conditioning prior to the re -infusion of the HSCs . The busulfan dose to be 
used in this clinical study will target a specific area under the curve ( AUC ), which will ensure 
more precise dosing and may reduce the risks of toxicity. The risks attached to busulfan are 
minimal, although there is a very small possibility of busulfan -related cancer.  
More common risks associated with busulfan at higher doses  include nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, constipation, loss of appetite, mouth sores, stomach/abdominal pain, dizziness, 
swelling ankles/feet/hand, flushing, headache, or trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_98710] a period of neutropaenia. 
However, the above systemic side -effects have not been seen at the proposed busulfan dose for 
this study.  
In the Sponsor's experience to date, there have been no busulfan -related serious adverse events 
(SAEs).

Study  Eigth sentence:  
Three  subjects have already been treated with cryopreserved cells (with a different 
cryoprotect ant as the one used under this protocol); two patients treated under Compassionate 
Use Program and one patient treated as an exemption in the US from the Phase  I/II studies 
conducted at GOSH/UCL and UCLA have received a cryopreserved formulation (not the ex act 
cyropreseved formulation used in this protocol) . [ADDRESS_268247] paragraph:  
This is a prospective, non -randomized, single -cohort, longitudinal, single -center, clinical study 
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of OT L-101 cryopreserved formulation administered 
in ADA -SCID subjects  aged between ≥30 days to <18  30 days and 17  years of  age, who are not 
eligible for an HLA -matched sibling /family  donor and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
This study aims to recruit 10 evaluable subjects.

3.7.1 OTL -101 
Storage and 
Security  The protocol treatment being investigated in this study ( OTL -101) is manufactured from the 
individual subject’s bone marrow CD34+ HSCs. The S ubject’s BM will be harvested at the 
clinical site and then transferred to a GMP compliant manufacturing facility for onward 
processing. At the GMP facility CD34+ cells will be isolated, transduced, formulated, filled 
into cryobags and then cryopreserved. The autologous, cryopreserved OTL 101 protocol 
treatment will be stored as part of a controlled inventory at ≤ -135°C in the vapor phase of LN2 
until released for administration to the subject. The storage of OTL -[ADDRESS_268298]  sample of non -transduced CD34+ cells will be retained in  i) the 
event of product damage or below product release specifications  during the thawing  of the 
GTMP OTL -[ADDRESS_268299] even of the GTMP al though 
the patient has already been conditioned or ii) lack of engraftment/hematopoeitic reconstitution 
at [ADDRESS_268300] GTMP  OTL -101 infusion  (see Sec tion 3.4). In the event that a second BM 
harvest is required, the same storage and security procedures will be followed .  A second 
backup sample is only required if the first back up is not reliable, e.g. if contamination of the 
initial marrow harvest had occurred . [ADDRESS_268301] bullet:

• Page 4, Synopsis , and Section 3.1, General Design and Study Scheme  – version 3.0 of the protocol included language regarding administration of 
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). This was modified to clarify that ERT use and discontinuation is to  be evaluated in tre ated patients at the 1 
month follow -up visit.  Additionally, the text was updated to clearly state that the need to reinstate ERT will be assessed at all follow -up visits after 
month 1 . The windows for all study visits were clearly stated in the synopsis, a nd the window for ERT discontinuation was  modified from (Day 30 
plus or minus 3 days ) to (Day 30 minus 3 plus 15 days ), allowing the Investigator to delay ERT discontinuation by a few days if in the best interest of 
the subject ;

ADA gene in PBMC/granulocytes” asse ssment was updated to include the possibility of being carried out in lineage -sorted cells. The “RCL assay in 
PBMC” assessment was added, and the schedules of the “ADA enzymatic assay” and “Deoxyadenine nucleotides in RBC” assessments were 
updated, in orde r to collect necessary s afety data and data on treatment effect and patient status. Flow cytometry markers in the legend of the

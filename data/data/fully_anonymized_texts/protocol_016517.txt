IL-[ADDRESS_723963] is bermekimab , a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody specific  for human interleukin- 1α (IL-1α). The entire bermekimab  heavy and light chain 
sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and 
heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a per ipheral blood B 
lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual. No in vitro  affinity maturation or 
modifications have been made to improve its natural binding affinity (211 +/ - 31 pM). We believe 
that a true human antibody should be effectively non- immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit 
optimal activity and pharmacokinetics.  XBiotech has conducted [ADDRESS_723964] been completed in  dermatologic indications 
(acne, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum), as well as one investigator sponsored study in 
Hidradenitis Suppurativa1,2,3.  Subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis experienced a rapid 
reduction in their psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), and subjects with acne vulgaris 
experienced reductions of inflammatory lesion counts, as well as reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_551025] (HADS). In both of these trials, there were few adverse events, which were all 
grade 1 (mild) and the only events that appeared to be related to therapy were mild injection site 
reactions in two patients.  
 
The investigator initiated study e nrolled patients with moderate to severe HS that were refractory 
to adalimumab.  The study was double blind, randomized and placebo controlled, and utilized the 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_723965]  2018                                            PAGE 13 of 52 
 Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score as a primary endpoint. Ten patients 
were randomized to placebo and 10 patients to treatment with bermekiamb .  A positive HiSCR 
score after 12 weeks was found in one (10%) and six (60%) patients respectively (OR: 13.50; 
95%CIs: 1.19- 152.61; p: 0.035). After withdrawal of therapy at week 12, a positive HiSCR score 
was found in nil (0%) and four (40%) patients after 24 weeks (p: 0.043).    
 
Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibodies are present in 5% to 28% of the general population4,5,6,7.  No 
negative correlations with disease have been noted for these individuals. To the contrary, the 
presence of natural anti -IL-1α antibodies has been associated with favorable outcomes, both with 
respect to rheumatoid arthritis and ischemic heart disease. Animal studies also indicate that IL -1α 
loss or antagonism does not result in harm. Moreover, the well -tolerated use of other approved 
biological agents that employ other strategies to block IL -[ADDRESS_723966] that bermekimab ’s 
targeting of IL -1α repr esents a safe treatment approach.  
 
1.2 RATIONALE  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease affecting as much as 20% of the population 
in western industrial societies. Chronic eczema in AD and associated pruritus can be a significant 
cause of morbidity and impact life quality. Disease pathogenesis is complex but ultimately 
converges on a pathological inflammatory process that disrupts the protective barrier function of 
the skin.  
 
The prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_551026] -1 alpha (IL -1⍺) plays a key role in the 
pathophysiology of a wide range of inflammatory skin disorders8.  Bermekimab  is a natural human 
antibody that exhibits immunoregulatory activity through blocking IL -1⍺ activity. Keratinocytes 
are a major reservoir of IL -1⍺ and may be a key source of inflammatory stimulus in AD. IL -1⍺ is 
present on leukocytes, where its role in leukocyte trafficking and infiltration may represent a key 
step in the chronic inflammation of AD. IL -1⍺ is a key inducer of matrix metalloproteinase s activity 
which could be directly involved in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_551027]9. Loss of regulation of 
IL-[ADDRESS_723967]  is bermekimab , a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody specific for human interleukin- 1α (IL-1α). The entire bermekimab  heavy and light chain 
sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and 
heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B 
lymphocyte that was obtained from a heal thy individual.  
 
Figure 2.1: Bermekimab  Antibody  
 
 
 
The bermekimab  primary glycoform has a molecular weight of 148.1 kilodaltons. Like all IgG1 
molecules, the heavy chains are joined at their hinge regions through two disulfide linkages, and 
each heavy ch ain is joined to one light chain through one disulfide linkage between their CH 1 and 
CL domains respectively.  
 
The main isoform has a pI [INVESTIGATOR_12862] 9.2 and comprises about 70- 80% of the total isoform population 
in all lots that have been manufactured to date, as determined by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_12863]. The 
heavy chain CH 2 domains are glycosylated primarily with the oligosaccharide structure shown in 
Figure 2.1, as determined by [CONTACT_12894]. The glycosylated residue 
(Asn -302 a s numbered from the N -terminus of bermekimab ) has been determined by [CONTACT_390918][INVESTIGATOR_390905] N -linked glycosylation site as found in endogenous 
IgG1 (Asn -297 according to the generic numbering system). Similarly, the primary glyc an, 
commonly referred to as G0F, is the same as that found on about 22% of endogenous human IgG 
molecules11.  
 
The entire bermekimab  heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally-
occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those 
originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy 
individual.

Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibody has been reported in 5% to 28% of healthy serum or plasma 
samples12,13. It has been measured in cord blood, children  and adults14. The anti-IL-1α antibodies  
measured in human plasma have been strictly of the IgG class, particularly IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4. 
Relatively equal distribution is seen in male and f emale plasma15. Binding affinities reported for 
endogenous anti -IL-1α antibodies, ranging from [ADDRESS_723969]  other therapeutic IgG products, for which 
the Fc regions are derived from a rare human allele, XBiotech’s product includes a heavy chain in 
which the constant (CH) region represents an allele found in approximately 70% of the human 
population. These two f eatures should make for a drug product with reduced potential for 
immunogenicity.

3.  STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES  
 
Phase 2, open label, dose escalation study of two dose cohorts of bermekima b in patients with 
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The study is multicenter, and will consist of two dose levels:  
Bermekimab  administered subcutaneously at a dose of 200 mg weekly (4 doses) and bermekimab  
administered subcutaneous ly at a dose of 400 mg weekly (8  doses).  Patients taking the 200mg dose 
will be followed for 5 weeks  (6 visits , day 35 +/-2), and patients taking the 400mg dose will be 
followed for 8 weeks (9 visits, day 56 +/-2) to allow for assessment of safety and preliminary 
efficacy . 
 
Dose escalation details can be found in Section 5.3.  
 
The protocol of the study will be approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) or the Ethics 
Committee (EC) of the participating study sites. Depending on the participating countries , both 
local and central IRB/EC approvals will be granted. The study will be registered at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov  before the enrollment of the first patient.  T he trial will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.

 3.1 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
Primary Endpoint:  
• Safety and Tolerability  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI) from baseline to visit  [ADDRESS_723982] to erythema, 
excoriation, infiltration and lichenification at 4 anatomic sites of the body: lower 
and upper extremities, trunk and head. The total EASI score shall be in a range 
(from 0 to 72 po ints ( from no disease to  maximum disease severity, respectively ). 
• Patients (%) achieving Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Response (0 or 1) at Visit 
8 
IGA assesses disease severity and clinical response using a 5 -point scale : 0 = clear; 
1 = almost  clear; 2 =  mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe. The score is determined by 
[CONTACT_551035]/infiltration. A clinical response to 
therapy will be an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear).  Patients receiving 
more than one treatment with  additional medication  to treat AD exacerbation  
during the study or missing IGA scores at Visit 8  will be treated as non -responders.  
• Patients (%) achieving ≥2 IGA Score Reduction at Visit 8  
• Pharmacokinetics (PK)  Assessment   
An enzyme -linked i mmunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to 
specifically measure b ermekimab  levels in human plasma. Blood will be drawn 
into a single 6 ml Na -Heparin collection  tube at each PK collection time point 
(sample collection is pre-dose at  visit 1,  visit 3, visit 5 , and visit  8). These samples 
will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor 
for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of 
antibodies against bermekimab . 
• Change (%) for peak weekly  averaged pruritus numerical rating scores (NRS) from 
baseline to visit 8  
1. The NRS rating system captures the intensity of patient’s itch  and pain over a 24- hour 
period. The following question will be presented to patients:  “how would a participant rate 
his or her  itch at the worst moment and on average  during the previous 24 hours (scale 0 -  
10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst possible itch] )?” and “ how would you rate your pain on average 
during the previous 24 hours  [0 = no pain ; 10 = severe pain ])? 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_723983]  2018                                            PAGE 22 of 52 
 • Change in weekly averaged peak NRS from baseline to visit 8   
• Change in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score from baseline to visit 8   
SCORAD was developed by [CONTACT_517764] 
(Severity scoring of atopic  dermatitis: the SCORAD index) as a measure of 
disease severity in AD. It includes assessment of the eczema in addition to patient 
reported symptoms. Total score ranges from 0 to 103 (no disease to most severe 
disease, respectively).  
• Patients (%) achieving  50%  or greater  reduction in EASI Score from baseline to  Visit 8  
• Patients (%) achieving 50%  or greater reduction in SCORAD Score to  Visit 8   
• Change (%) in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) Scores from baseline to Visit 8  
POEM is a 7 -item is a patient reported quality of life outcome measure based on a 
questionnaire to determine disease symptoms, including bleeding, cracking, 
dryness, flaking, itching, sleep loss and weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The scoring range is from 0 to 
28 (no disease to most severe disease, respecti vely). 
• Changes in Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) from baseline to visit 8  
• Change from baseline to visit 8  in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12845] (HADS)  
• Change (%) from pre - and post - injection of Visit [ADDRESS_723984] ionnaire for pruritus, pain and 
erythema 
 
 
 
 GISS assesses AD lesions for erythema, excoriations, lichenification and 
edema/papulation. Each component will be rated on a global basis (over the entire 
body surface rather t han by [CONTACT_11338]) using a 4- point scale (0=none, 1=mild, 
2=moderate and 3=severe) according to the EASI grading severity. Total score will 
range from 0 to 12 (no disease to most severe disease, respectively ). 
• Change from baseline to visit 8  in Dermatology Lif e Quality Index (DLQI)

5.3 DOSE ESCALATION RULES  
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) 
v4.03 will be used to grade the severity of adverse events.   
 Any AE (with the exception of worsening AD symptoms or injection site reactions) of 
grade [ADDRESS_724006] be reported to the 
sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event.   
 Any grade  [ADDRESS_724007] be reported to the sponsor within 24 
hours of learning of the event.  
 If three  or more probably or definitely related grade 2 or greater AEs,  and/or three or more 
grade 3 or greater injection site reactions occur i n either group, dosing will be stopped for 
safety assessment .  
 
5.4 RESCUE TREATMENT(S)  
If medically necessary (ie, to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD may be 
provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator. For the purpose of efficacy  analysis, 
patients who receive rescue treatment during the study treatment period will be  considered 
treatment failures, but they will continue study treatment if rescue consisted of topi[INVESTIGATOR_551030]. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_551031], but should be reserved for  problem areas 
only, eg, face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas, etc. If possible, investigators should attempt 
to limit the first step of rescue therapy to topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910], and escalate to  systemic medications 
only for patients who do not respond adequately after at least [ADDRESS_724008]  2018                                            PAGE 34 of 52 
 immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine, methotrexate , mycophenolate -mofetil, azathioprine, etc.) 
study treatment will be immediately discontinued.  Investigators should make every attempt to 
conduct  efficacy and safety assessments (eg, disease severity scores, safety labs) immediately 
before  administering an y rescue treatment.  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_724009] immediately be discont inued for any the following 
reasons:  
 Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason)  
 Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, inter -current illness, or clinical progression 
of disease which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_111651], indicates that continued 
participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject  
 Pregnancy  
 Termination of the study by [CONTACT_456]  
 Imprisonment or the compulsory detention for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., 
infectious disease) illness  
 Any Grade 2 or greater adverse event (with the exception of worsening AD symptoms  or 
injection site reactions ) that is determined to be probably or definitely related to study drug 
administration.  
 Any Grade 3 or g reater injection site reaction  
 Certain rescue treatments as specified in section 5.4  
 
 
5.6 T RIAL S TOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] R ULES  
Enrollment of any further patients for the trial will be suspended for the following events:  
• The death of a subject at any time during the trial that is deemed to be probably or 
definitely related to the administration of MABp1  
• The occurrence of [ADDRESS_724010]  2018                                            PAGE 35 of 52

6.  CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
6.1 PHARMACOKINETICS  (PK) SAMPLE COL LECTION  
An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure 
bermekimab  levels in human plasma. Blood will be drawn into a single 6 ml collection  tube at each 
PK collection time point (pre -dose sample collection at visit 1, visit 3 , visit 5,  and visit 8). These 
samples will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor for PK  
analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies against 
bermekimab  and biomarker analysis.   
 
7.  ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], vital signs, physical examinations,  ECG  and 
clinical laboratory measurements. All subjects who have received at least one dose of b ermekimab  
will be  included in the safety analysis.  Adverse eve nts will be monitored from Visit  1 (post -
infusion) to Visit 9.  Any serious adverse events or grade [ADDRESS_724011] stabilized.     
 
Any AE (with the exception of worsening AD symptoms or injection site reactions) of grade [ADDRESS_724012] demography (age, sex, race, weight, and BMI) , 
medical history, medication history, and prior biologic use for each patient.  Characteristics of the 
patient ’s atopic dermatitis, including duration of disease, baseline EASI score (including individual 
signs score), baseline Investigator’s Global Assessm ent, baseline body surface area involvement, 
baseline pruritus numerical rating score, baseline SCORAD score, baseline patient oriented eczema 
measure, baseline DLQI, and baseline HADS score, will be collected.   Baseline is defined as the 
visit 1 pre -injec tion assessment.  
 
8.2 S TUDY ENDPOINT  DEFINITIONS  
Eczema Area and Severity Index  
The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity 
and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_173894] a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (sev ere). In addition, the area of AD involvement 
will be assessed as a percentage by [CONTACT_12904], trunk, arms, and legs and converted to a 
score of 0 to 6.   
Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure 
bermekimab  levels in human plasma. Blood will be drawn into a single 6 ml  Na-Heparin collection 
tube at each PK collection time point (sample collection is pre-dose at visit 1,  visit 3, visit 5, and 
visit 8). These samples will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the 
Sponsor for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies 
against bermekimab . 
 
Investigator’s Global Assessment  
The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical 
response to treatment based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).   
 
Global Individual Signs Score  
Individual components of the A D lesions (erythema, edema /papulation, excoriations, and  
lichenification) will be rated globally (ie, each assessed for the whole body, not by [CONTACT_551038]) on a 4- point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria.  
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_724013]  2018                                            PAGE 37 of 52 
 SCORing  Atopic Dermatitis  
The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was  developed 
to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD.  There are 3 components to the 
assessment: A = extent or affected body surface area, B =  intensity , and C = subjective symptoms. 
The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each  defined body area  and reported as the sum of 
all areas, with a maximum  score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). 
The intensity  of 6 specific  symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin  
thickening/  lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1),  
moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assig ned as “B” in the overall  
SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each  
symptom by [CONTACT_12906] a VAS, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_724014] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), w ith a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter  is 
assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 +  7B/2 + 
C where the maximum is 103.   
 
Patient Assessment of Pruritus and Pain  
The NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus 
(itch)  and pain during a daily recall period using a study diary. Patients will be asked to complete 
the following questions:  
• For average itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the 
‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you rate your itch on average  during the previous 24 
hours?”  
• For maximum itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the 
‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you ra te your itch at the worst moment  during the 
previous 24 hours?”  
• For pain intensity: “ On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no pain’ and 10 being the ‘ most 
severe pain ’, how would you rate your pain on average  during the previous 24 hours? ” 
Patients will be instructed to record their NRS score daily from  day 0 to day 56  (+/-2). Sites will 
be expected to review the diary at each visit  and enter the data from the previous 7 days . 
 
Visit 1  Questionnaire  for Pruritus, Pain and Erythema  
The following  questions assess the intensity of pruritus (itch) and pain experienced by [CONTACT_551039] 1 .  The patient will answer the following 
questions : 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_724015]  2018                                            PAGE 38 of 52 
 1. On a scale of 0 to 10, what is the current intensity  of itch, with 0 being ‘no itch’ 
and 10 be ing the ‘worst itch imaginable’.  
2. On a scale of 0 to 10, what is the current  intensity  of pain, with 0 being ‘no pain’ 
and 10 being ‘severe pain’.  
The Investigator will assess the patient’s Erythema and complete the following on the  Visit 1 
Questionnaire : 
3. What is the current status of the patient’s erythema overall?  
a. None◻   Mild ◻ Moderate ◻  Severe ◻ 
b. Please describe area(s) and degree(s) of the patient’s erythema in detail  and if 
applicable any post -injection changes observed .  
 
The Visit 1  Questionnaire will be performed twice:  
1. Visit 1 , pre-injection of bermekimab ;   
2. Visit [ADDRESS_724016] -injection of bermekimab . 
 
Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  
The POEM is a 7 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess 
disease symptoms in children and adults. The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, 
flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 
0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = every day ) with a scoring 
system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease- related morbidity.   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101783]- psychiatric populations; 
repeated administration also provides information about changes to a patient’s emotional state. The 
HADS consists of 14 items, 7 each for anxiety and depression symp toms; possible scores range 
from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut -off scores are recommended for both subscales: 
[ADDRESS_724017] of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QOL. The format is a simple response (0 to 
3 where 0 is “not at all” and 3 is “very much”) to [ADDRESS_724018] 
week, with an overall scoring system of 0 to 30; a high score is indicative of a poor QOL.   
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_724019]  2018                                            PAGE 39 of 52 
 9.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
9.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENT (AE)  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a 
clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with the pharmaceutical or 
biological agent under study.  An AE can therefore be  any of the following : 
 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laborato ry findings), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of bermekimab , whether or not it is apparently related to 
bermekimab  
• A concurrent illness  
• An exacerbation, or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a preexisting 
condition, including intermittent or epi[INVESTIGATOR_11238].  However, anticipated day -to-day 
fluctuations or expected progression of the preexisting condition (based upon the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment) are not to be considered AEs  
• A significant or unexpected wor sening of the condition/indication under investigation.  
However, anticipated day -to-day fluctuations or expected progression of the disease under 
investigation (based upon the Investigator’s clinical judgment) are not to be considered AEs  
• A suspected inte raction between the investigational drug and concomitant medications  
• Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality (including radiological interpretations, 
histopathological findings, etc .) 
 
9.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENT (SAE ) 
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that  meets any of the 
following criteria :  
• Results in death  
• Life-threatening  
• Requires or pro longs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in a persi stent or significant disability  
• Congeni tal anomaly/birth defect  
• An important medical event that, while it may not result in death or be immediately life -
threatening or require/prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may jeopardize the subject and/or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of t he outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_724020]  2018                                            PAGE 40 of 52 
 bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Note that seriousness and severity should not be confused. A subject could experience a severe 
headache that would not qualify as an SAE, while another might experience a mild stroke that, 
while not severe, would be considered serious.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_724021] be recorded on the case report form (CRF)/eCRF and in the patient’s  
source document s occurring between visit  1 (post-injection)  and visit 9 (or if subject terminates 
from study prior to visit 9, seven days after the last administration of bermekimab) .   
 
All AEs should be recorded in standard medical terminology as concisely as possible.  The AE 
recorded should not be a procedure or a clinical/laboratory measurement but should reflect the 
event leading to the procedur e or the cause of the clinical/laboratory abnormality, if known.  
Whenever possible, AEs should be evaluated and recorded as a diagnosis, rather than individual 
signs and symptoms.  However , if a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs a nd 
symptoms should be recorded.  Any AE that worsens in intensity, or becomes serious, should be 
recorded as a new event.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_724022] be considered.  
 
Relationship to study drug is summarized as follows:  
• Not Related:   There is another obviou s cause of the AE  
• Unlikely to be related:   There is another more likely cause of the AE  
• Possibly related:  The AE could have been due to the investigational drug  
• Probably related:   The AE is probably attributable to the investigational drug  
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_724023]  2018                                            PAGE 41 of 52 
 • Definitely rela ted:  The AE is most likely attributable to the investigational drug  
 
9.6 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Any AE (with the exception of worsening AD symptoms or injection site reactions) of grade [ADDRESS_724024] be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the 
event . 
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_724025] should be made and recorded 
on the SAE form . The immediate and follow -up reports should identify subjects by [CONTACT_551040] d to the trial subjects rather than by [CONTACT_748]' names, personal identification 
numbers, and/or addresses. The Investigator should also submit SAEs to the IRB /EC according to 
their IRB /EC guidelines [ICH -GCP E6].  Drug -related Serious Adverse Events wi ll be reported to 
the FDA by [CONTACT_12913]’s Medical Safety Officer according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
9.7 REFERENCE SAFETY INF ORMATION:  POTENTIAL  ADVERSE REACTIONS  
[ADDRESS_724026] ered at 7.5 mg/kg to refractory, metastatic CRC patients with cancer 
associated symptoms at baseline (ECOG performance status 1 and 2).  In this trial (PT026), which 
is the largest controlled trial completed with bermekimab  to date (N=309), patients were dosed at 
7.5 mg/kg for metastatic colorectal cancer.  The most common AEs reported (>10%) were 
abdominal pain, peripheral edema, fatigue, anemia, constipation, decrease in weight, asthenia, 
decreased appetite, and nausea.  The majority of these events were grade 1 or 2 and appeared to be 
related to the underlying CRC.  The prevalence of these events was similar in the bermekimab  and 
placebo groups.  Two infusion reactions were reported in this trial, and they were not serious or 
severe (grade I or II).  
 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_724027]  2018                                            PAGE 42 of 52 
  Bermekimab  is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin-
1α (IL-1α). As such, it is an immunomodulator that has anti -inflammatory and anti -neoplastic 
properties.  Other agents that could be considered in the same pharmacolo gic class include biologic 
agents that target IL -[ADDRESS_724028] been made to improve its natural 
binding affinity (211 +/ - 31 pM).  We believe that a true human antibody should be effectively non-
immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit optimal activity and pharmacokinetics.  To date, no 
treatment emergent anti -drug antibodies specific to b ermek imab  have been identified.  
 
The mechanism behind infusion reactions is not clear in all cases.  It may involve a reactio n against 
the antibody , against excipi[INVESTIGATOR_551033], or against some minor 
residual component from the manufacturing process (i.e. host cell proteins).  To date, there has 
been a very low incidence of mild injection site or infusion reactions observed (20 patients out of 
831 total; 2.4%).  All except two of these patients had grade [ADDRESS_724029] be ensured.  Pre -medication with antihistamines or corticosteroids is not 
required.  
For the purposes of expedited safety reporting in clinical trials, the following should be considered 
expected events:  
• Infusion Related Reactions  
• Injection Site Reactions

 10.  STATISTICAL PLAN  
 
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol, and to make 
changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and dat a that may affect planned analyses.   
Analysis variables are listed in Section 8.  
 
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES IS 
No formal hypothesis tests will be performed for the primary endpoints.  
 
10.2 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 
The sample size chosen was one of convenience, and no formal sample size calculations were 
performed. 
 
10.3 ANALYSIS SETS  
10.3.1 Safety Analysis Sets  
The safety analysis set (SAF) consists of all patients that receive at least one dose of study 
medication and will be analyzed as treated.  
 
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed based upon the SAF, as well as the per protocol 
population (PP).  The per protocol population will consist of those patients that complete both the 
baseline and visit 8  assessments of their atopic disease ( as specified for the secondary endpoints ). 
 
10.4 PATIENT DISPOSITION  
A listing of all patients prematurely discontinued from the study, along with reasons for  
discontinuation will be provided. In addition, the total number of patie nts for each of the  
following categories will be summarized.  
 
• The total number of screened patients: met the inclusion criteria regarding the target

sheet(s), details of the subject recruitment procedures and any other relevant study documentation 
will be submitted to the responsible IRB or Ethics Committee (EC).  The Investigator will report 
promptly to the IRB/EC any new information that may adversely affect the safety of subjects or the 
conduct of the study. Similarly, the Investigator will submit written summaries of the study status 
to the IRB/EC annually, or more frequently if requested by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  Upon completion of the 
study, the Investigator will provide the IRB/EC with a brief report of the outcome of the study, if 
required.  
 
11.3 PROTOCOL MODIFICATIONS  
Modifications of the signed protocol are only possible by [CONTACT_551043].  The procedure for approval of a protocol amendment is 
identical to that for approval of the protocol.  The IRB/EC must be informed of all protocol 
amendments and sho uld be asked for its opi[INVESTIGATOR_12879] a full re -evaluation of the ethical 
aspects of the study is necessary by [CONTACT_942].  This should be fully documented.  The 
Investigator must not implement any deviation from or change to the protocol, without discussion 
with an agreement by [CONTACT_390925]/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_12880]/EC, except where it is necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects, or where the change(s) involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in CRA(s), change of telephone number(s)). 
Protocol amendments will be submitted to the appropriate authority(ies) as required by [CONTACT_12926](s).  
 
XBIOTECH [LOCATION_003] INC.             PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.[ADDRESS_724039] has given an IRB/EC approved informed consent.  The 
subject must give written consent after the receipt of detailed information.  The verbal explanation 
will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject.  The 
Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards 
of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject must be given every opportunity 
to clarify any points he/she does not understand and if necessary, ask for more information.  At the 
end of the interview, the subject may be given t ime to reflect if this is required, or if the subject 
requests more time.  Subjects and/or legal guardian forms will be kept and archived by [CONTACT_551044]'s study file.  It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to 
withd raw their consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.  Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent 
may not be included or continued in this study, but this will not impact their subsequent care.  The 
Investigator will notify in writing each subject’s primary care physician (or equivalent) of the 
subject’s intent to participate in the study.

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14)       page 2 of 41  Précis: Objective In this Phase I, proof-of-concept study, we aim to determine whether an antiretroviral regimen approved to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection would also suppress levels of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K (HERV-K) found to be activated in a subset of participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose to measure the of blood levels of HERV-K by [CONTACT_901518], during, and after treatment with an antiretroviral regimen. We will evaluate the safety of the antiretroviral regimen for participants with ALS and also explore clinical and neurophysiological outcomes of ALS symptoms, quality of life, and pulmonary function.   Study Population We will study a subset of ALS participants who have a ratio of HERV-K:RPP30 greater than or equal to 13.  About 30% of ALS participants may have detectable levels of HERV-K; about 20% of participants with ALS have a level >1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml. To show whether the HERV-K could be suppressed, we will recruit from the approximately 20% of participants with the high levels so that the antiretroviral effect can be determined.   Design This is an open-label study of a combination antiretroviral therapy for 24 weeks in up to 25 HIV-negative, HTLV-negative ALS participants with high ratio of HERV-K:RPP30. The study duration for each participant will be up to 72 weeks. Participants will be followed regularly for safety, clinical, and neurophysiological outcomes.  Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure will be the percent decline in blood HERV-K concentration measured by [CONTACT_956].  Percent decline for a participant is measured by: 100 x (screening visit – week 24 visit measurement) / screening visit. The safety of antiretrovirals in volunteers with ALS as measured by [CONTACT_901519], the ability to remain on assigned treatment (tolerability), physical examinations, laboratory test results, vital signs, and weight/body mass index (BMI). Efficacy will be explored by [CONTACT_901520]: the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), the ALS Specific Quality of Life Inventory-Revised (ALSSQOL-R), the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS), vital capacity and maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_901479], electrical impedance myography (EIM), the change in neurofilament levels in blood and/or CSF, and the change in urine p75ECD levels.

Introduction ALS Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, usually fatal degenerative disorder of large motor neurons of the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spi[INVESTIGATOR_901482]. It has a prevalence of 3.9 cases/100,000 persons in the [LOCATION_002] and the lifetime risk for individuals is 1/600 to 1/1000. ALS affects individuals of nearly all ages, genders, races, and geographic locations.1 The median age of onset is 55 years. There is a slight male predominance (3:2 men:women) in sporadic ALS. Age and gender are the only risk factors consistently seen in epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037].1 Fifty percent of people with ALS will die within three years of onset of symptoms and 90% die within five years.2 The only available pharmacotherapy for ALS, riluzole, prolongs survival by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 60-90 days.3  Essential features of ALS are progressive signs and symptoms of lower motor neuron dysfunction (atrophy, cramps, and fasciculations) associated with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_809905] (spasticity, enhanced and pathological reflexes) typi[INVESTIGATOR_901483].4 There is relative sparing of muscles of eye movement and the urinary sphincters. The course is relentless; strength, respi[INVESTIGATOR_901484]. Hypoxia and pneumonia account for the majority of deaths in patients with ALS.5  The majority of ALS cases are sporadic (sALS); 10% are familial (fALS). Mutations in specific genes or loci have been identified in ~40% familial and ~10% of sporadic cases.[ADDRESS_1264663] frequently detected involve C9ORF72, superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and the TAR-DNA-binding protein (TARDBP). C9ORF72 is strongly associated with ALS cases in which motor neuron degeneration is accompanied by [CONTACT_901521].7 Clusters of cases were also reported in football and soccer players, suggesting the possibility of trauma as a triggering event. Pathophysiological processes implicated in ALS include: toxicity from excess excitation of the motor neuron by [CONTACT_809945], free radical-mediated oxidative cytotoxicity, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmune processes, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and aberrant activation of cyclo-oxygenase.  ALS and Viruses It was also suggested that a virus may be associated with ALS, in part because of the marked similarities in the histopathologic and neuroanatomic findings in ALS and poliomyelitis.[ADDRESS_1264664]-viral syndrome is the primary cause of ALS.  A concrete link to a viral infection has never been documented in ALS; however, the research investigating such a link led to several noteworthy findings.   The first demonstration of a possible viral association with ALS was in 1975 when reverse transcriptase (RT), an enzyme essential for replication of retroviruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or Human T-lymphotropic virus [HTLV]), was found post-mortem in two Guamanian ALS patients’ brains but not in brains from two control individuals.9 Subsequent studies showed approximately 53% (n=131) of ALS patients have detectable serum levels of RT compared with 12% (n=152) of controls (Table 1).  Interestingly, relatives related by [CONTACT_901522].  To date, there are no reported genetic testing results for these unaffected controls with detectable RT levels to see if they share a genetic mutation associated with ALS.

NR, not reported  Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERV) The reason for some ALS patients having detectable levels of the RT enzyme in brain and serum is unclear.  The studies that have looked for retroviruses have not been able to detect them (Table 1).  However, RT may not be produced by [CONTACT_901523]/acquired retrovirus and could be associated with an endogenous retrovirus instead.  When retroviruses infect humans, they incorporate their genetic information into a host’s DNA.  Through ancestral retroviral infections, and the successive sharing of these retroviral genetic elements with infected persons’ progeny, 8-9% of our human genome is now made of retroviral elements.  These elements closely resemble viruses and thus are termed human “endogenous” retroviruses (HERV) in contrast to exogenous, infectious retroviruses such as HIV or HTLV.  Some of these elements may form viral particles although there is no evidence that these endogenous retroviruses remain infectious or are the primary etiologic agent of any disease.  Research studies have shown that some diseases are associated with an increased expression of endogenous retroviral elements, e.g., in rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus; however, the significance of these findings is uncertain.11,[ADDRESS_1264665] attention due to the presence of a complete open-reading frame (cORF) and the ability to form virus-like particles.  We analyzed serum samples from 190 different participants: 72 with ALS, 53 with frontotemporal dementia (a neurodegenerative condition often associated with ALS), 26 with Alzheimer’s dementia, 9 from family members of ALS patients, and 30 healthy controls. All samples were obtained from neurologists at Emory University. We analyzed the samples in a blinded fashion so that we did not know the diagnosis until after determining the results. The methods are described in Section 9.2.  Six of 72 samples from patients with

There was no detectable HERV-K in samples from healthy controls or patients with either frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia (Figure 1). Low level activation was found in first-degree blood relatives of ALS patients similar to the finding reported for reverse transcriptase detection.             We also confirmed the presence of HERV-K in post-mortem brain samples from ALS patients. Using samples from both patients and healthy controls, we determined that the entire HERV-K genome (Figure 2A) and spliced transcripts were expressed in both sets. Initial observations suggested that the 4.5 kb spliced env transcript was exclusively expressed in brains from ALS patients (3 of 11). Expression of HERV-K transcripts was further confirmed by [CONTACT_901524], gag, pol and env, were elevated in the ALS brain samples (Figure 2B and C). There was good correlation between the expression of each of these genes confirming that the entire viral genome is expressed in these patients. This is consistent with our previous observation where HERV-K pol RNA transcript was expressed in the brain of sporadic ALS patients but not in those with Parkinson’s disease13. No particular clinical phenotype was associated with the expression of HERV-K in ALS patients.  To determine the cell types in which HERV-K was expressed, we immunostained brain tissue from ALS patients using an antibody to the HERV-K env. We found expression of the env protein in 3 of 5 individuals (Figure 2D and E), with strong expression in the large pyramidal neurons of the cortex (Figure 2F). The expression was exclusively in the neuronal cytoplasm and was concentrated in foci at the cell membrane (Figure 2F). Anterior horn neurons in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_901485]-K env. These cells had a dysmorphic appearance (Figure 2G). No immunostaining was noted in the glial cells or in the white matter (Figure 2H).  It is likely that reverse transcriptase is a less specific finding than the RNA transcripts of HERV-K and thus fewer ALS patients have HERV-K compared to those with reverse transcriptase activity.  To date, there is no clear phenotypic differences in those ALS patients with or without elevated levels of HERV-K; however, the sample size of current data is limited to make such conclusions.

The significance of this immune response is not clear. We are thus validating these assays and developi[INVESTIGATOR_901486]. We will also develop a cell-based assay to monitor HERV-K expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Once developed we will determine the immune response to HERV-K in the context of this current study.  Neurofilament levels in ALS: Recent studies have shown that phosphorylated heavy and light chain neurofilament levels can be measured in CSF and blood. These levels correlate with disease severity and rate of progression.14 Neurofilament release in the CSF and blood is an indicator of neuronal injury and even though it may not be specific for ALS, it could be a useful marker for monitoring the effects of treatment in this population.  Urine p75ECD in ALS: Urine p75ECD has been shown recently to correlate well with ALS disease progression including with the clinical rating scale, the revised ALSFRS.15  Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Motor Neuron Disease: ALS occasionally affects patients with HIV infection with the first case described as early as 1985.[ADDRESS_1264666] been reported.17 With comorbid HIV, there were several unique characteristics of ALS that appear in some cases: younger age at onset, more rapid progression, and elevated CSF protein; however, the significance of these apparent differences is not entirely certain because the number of patients is limited and the phenotypic variability is rather high.

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14)       page [ADDRESS_1264668] when treated with HIV medications is remarkable.  In a small case series, HIV infection was newly diagnosed at the time of ALS symptom presentation for 38% of patients. The severity of immunosuppression was variable, with CD4 counts ranging from 2 to 618 cells/mm3, and HIV viral load ranged from undetectable to 7.8x104 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml. Because of the somewhat unique clinical characteristics and the potential for a clinical response to antiretroviral therapy (ART), ALS is often named “ALS-like” when it affects a patient with comorbid HIV even though patients meet El Escorial criteria for an ALS diagnosis.  Alternatively, some authors have referred to it as “motor neuron disease.”  Response to Antiretroviral Therapy: All patients with HIV-associated ALS who clinically improved or became stabilized were treated with ART. The response to ART typi[INVESTIGATOR_901487]4 count. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_901488], normal CD4 counts and an undetectable plasma viral load, three patients experienced a clinical relapse after a period of initial improvement (15 months in one and 24 months in two).[ADDRESS_1264669] that the neurological manifestations of ALS either with or without HIV are indistinguishable in many cases. The patients may be younger and the course of disease without treatment may be worse; however, the clinical phenotype is indistinguishable. A retrovirus as a cause of a subset of ALS cases is supported by [CONTACT_901525] 52% of HIV-associated ALS cases. This is quite controversial. HIV does not infect neurons.[ADDRESS_1264670] HIV, or any virus, directly to motor neurons and muscle fiber loss16,23,24 although the possibility exists that in these rare cases, HIV may transactivate an endogenous retrovirus25 which would explain the response to ART in these patients.   Treatment of ALS with ART Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_901489]. Zidovudine was used for 12 patients with ALS at a dose of 500 mg daily. Only interim results were published with patients completing between 2-10 months of therapy. The authors did not feel there was a significant change in the disease course with zidovudine since 5/12 patients died at the time of publication. They noted that zidovudine was well tolerated among the patients and that serum CK levels decreased during treatment although no other outcome measures were reported.26 Indinavir was tested in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial27 powered to measure safety and feasibility. Four of 23 participants receiving indinavir developed nephrolithiasis, and only 12 patients in the treatment group completed the 9-month trial. The authors cite disease progression and inability to travel as the two primary reasons why participants could not complete the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was a faster rate of

In a recent study in Australia, called the Lighthouse Study, 35 patients were treated with combination ART, Triumeq (abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine) for a period of six months. The patients were enrolled at four different sites. Serum samples from [ADDRESS_1264672] analyzed these samples for HERV-K using a newly developed digital PCR assay in our lab. The advantage of this assay as compared to the qPCR assay is that it is highly accurate, many of the steps are automated hence it is highly reproducible as well. Data from those 10 patients shows that in 4/[ADDRESS_1264673] viral load (Figure 3). The clinical significance of this drop in viral load is not clear.         Rationale Summary It is well established that a subset of patients with ALS have detectable blood levels of HERV-K viral load, and both the titer levels and proportion of patients with detectable levels are greater in patients with ALS compared to healthy controls and to those with other neurologic diseases. The clinical significance of this HERV-K viral load to disease pathogenesis and phenotype is entirely uncertain. It is also well established that HIV-infected patients who develop an ALS-like syndrome may have lasting improvement in strength and function when treated with antiretroviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This study will allow an initial clinical investigation to explore the concept that the HERV-K viral load is susceptible to suppression similar to levels of HIV RNA when treated with antiretroviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Rationale for Using Antiretroviral Therapy We have tested approximately [ADDRESS_1264674] HERV-K (Figure 3). Of note in Figure 3, indinavir has limited activity against HERV-K; this was the agent studied in one of the prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_901490].

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14)       page 12 of 41             We calculated the IC90 (the drug concentration required for 90% suppression, a standard for determining antiretroviral drug efficacy) for each of the drugs and compared it to that reported in the literature for effects on HIV replication (Table 2). It appears that the effects of zidovudine and abacavirare similar against both viruses, while lopi[INVESTIGATOR_901491]; however, the effects of darunavir appeared to be 3-[ADDRESS_1264675] on HIV although the effects are still in the nM range (Table 2). In addition to the protease inhibitor (darunavir boosted with ritonavir) with the highest impact on HERV-K replication, we propose using an integrase inhibitor (dolutegravir) because it penetrates into the CNS, is effective against a broad range of retroviruses (less specific for HIV) and it could prevent infection of new cells by [CONTACT_901526].  Rationale for tenofovir alafenamide fumerate (TAF) A recent study shows that the IC50 for tenofovir against HERV-K was 3.[ADDRESS_1264676] HERV-K.28 While the penetration of tenofovir across the blood brain barrier is poor, a new form of the drug, tenofovir alafenamide fumerate (TAF) has several hundred-fold higher concentrations in the brain. We thus propose to use TAF instead of zidovudine, which also has a better side effect profile.  Rationale for dolutegravir Dolutegravir is a newer integrase inhibitor with similar properties to raltegravir; however it has much better CNS penetration and thus is more appropriate for this study.

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14)       page 13 of 41  Rationale for Experimental Therapeutics in ALS Riluzole, a drug that has multiple mechanisms of action including inhibition of release of glutamate at pre-synaptic terminals, was reported in two controlled studies to extend survival by [CONTACT_901527] a concomitant improvement in strength. This is currently the only FDA-approved agent for use in ALS. Trials of thalidomide, tamoxifen, dexpramipexole, IGF-1, gabapentin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), xaliproden, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], celecoxib, creatine, lithium, talampanel, and ceftriaxone, among others, were shown to be ineffective in treating ALS.   Because there are no ALS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_901494], there is a need for trials to explore novel pathways in ALS.  This study is an early-phase proof-of-concept trial that may help open pathways for additional novel experimentation in ALS.  24-week Treatment Duration Rationale We anticipate that suppression of reverse transcriptase to undetectable levels will require treatment for several months. By [CONTACT_7661] a 24-week duration of medications, we expect to observe sustained suppression in HERV-K viral load if it can occur with the ART regimen.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-moderate hepatic or renal impairment.  Dolutegravir is available in 50mg film-coated tablets.   Darunavir with boosted ritonavir and another integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, were studied extensively in clinical trials.  8-12% of patients with HIV have not had virologic suppression during trials lasting up to 212 weeks.  During this time, 66-70% of patients starting either medicine remained on the medicine and on study until completion and remained virologically suppressed (Table 5).    Tenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transciptase inhibitor that blocks the enzyme required for replication of retroviruses.  It was FDA approved to treated HIV in 2016.  No dosage adjustments are recommeneded for patients with mild-severe renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment.  It is available only as a 25mg tablet to be taken once daily and there is no liquid formulation available.

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14)       page 15 of 41  The primary objective is to assess whether an antiretroviral regimen of darunavir + ritonavir, dolutegravir, and TAF for 24 weeks will suppress blood levels of HERV-K RNA below the limit of detection (1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) in patients with HERV-K-positive ALS.  2.2. Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study are: 1. To assess the safety of an antiretroviral regimen of darunavir + ritonavir, dolutegravir, and TAF in patients with ALS. 2. The percent decline in blood HERV-K concentration: 100% x (screening visit – week 24 visit measurement)/screening visit measurement.  2.3. Exploratory Objectives: The exploratory objectives will guide decisions on future studies of antiretroviral therapy in ALS patients. • Evaluate the efficacy of ART on clinical biomarkers of ALS that measure symptoms, neurophysiologic outcomes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], and quality of life. • Evaluate whether known genetic variability associated with ALS accounts for variable suppression of HERV-K viral load in blood levels by [CONTACT_309231]. • Evaluate effect of ART on HERV-K antibody levels in blood and/or CSF and effects on intracellular HERV-K expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes. These assays are currently under development in our laboratory and will be applied to stored samples once available.  3. Subjects 3.1. Description of study populations  Participants may be included with a diagnosis of clinically probable, laboratory-supported clinically probable, or clinically definite ALS. By [CONTACT_901528], we will allow participants to enroll earlier in the course of illness. This is a common inclusion method for ALS clinical trials because the median time from symptom onset to clinically-definite ALS is over 12 months. More than 25% of ALS patients die without meeting the El Escorial criteria for clinically definite ALS.[ADDRESS_1264684] elevated levels of the HERV-K:RPP30 greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1264685] the concept that antiretrovirals can suppress the HERV-K levels.

Study Overview This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, baseline-versus-treatment study of darunavir, dolutegravir, ritonavir, and TAF in ALS patients. Up to 25 patients with ALS and with a ratio of HERV-K:RPP30 greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1264689]-treatment follow-up for an additional 24 weeks.  The study duration for each participant could be up to 72 weeks (i.e. when 24 weeks elapses between initial blood draw and the screening visit). Study evaluations will be completed as outlined in Section 4.5.  For participant convenience, some of the visits may be completed as an inpatient or outside of NIH.   4.2. Recruitment Participants will be recruited from physician referral, self-referral, and through advertisement.  Referring providers may share the contact [CONTACT_901529].  Potential participants will be pre-screened for this study. Available records may be reviewed to evaluate eligibility for this study. We anticipate the following documentation to be available for pre-screening review: demographic information, the ALS diagnosis category, medications, and comorbid medical conditions. We anticipate that some patients may have been screened for HIV and HTLV during their diagnostic workup for ALS and these results may be available during the pre-screening review.   Potential participants who meet eligibility criteria based on the pre-screening review will be offered enrollment onto this study.   4.3. Screening After signing on to the Blood Draw Only Consent, participants will undergo a venipuncture with removal of up to 20 ml of whole blood to check the HERV-K:RPP30 ratio.  Subjects may have research blood drawn as outpatients at the NIH’s CRC in Bethesda, MD or at an offsite location for convenience of the participant.

Participants who are still eligible after the results are available will sign the consent for the full study and complete their screening at NIH.  The screening visit will take place at a maximum of 24 weeks from the date of the screening HERV-K blood draw.  During the screening and enrollment visit, participants will review and sign the study consent before any procedures are performed.  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature), height, and weight will be measured. A comprehensive medical history will be taken including details of medical illness, vaccinations, current medications, allergies, social and family histories, and participation in other research trials. Each participant will have a general and neurologic examination.  Prior neuroimaging will be reviewed.  Vital capacity and maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_901496] a handheld spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]. Laboratory evaluations will include tests for research and safety labs as detailed in Section 4.5. The ALSFRS-R, ALSSQOL-R, optional ALS-CBS, lumbar puncture and neurophysiologic measurements will be completed.  During times that participant participation in the Clinical Center is restricted or when participant travel to the Clinical Center is not safe, for example during times of pandemics, protocol screening and study visits will continue offsite.  The study team will use the most recent exam by [CONTACT_2299]’s community neurologist as the baseline neurological exam, vital signs, and weight.  Safety and research labs as outlined in Section 4.[ADDRESS_1264690] of the blood draw and laboratory tests. The study team will arrange a telehealth or telephone visit with the participant to get informed consent, a medical history, and administer the ALSFRS-R, ALSSQOL-R, and optional ALS-CBS. Participants that enroll offsite will continue the study offsite through Week 48.  Vital capacity, maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_27111], neurophysiologic measurements, lumbar puncture will be omitted for these participants.    An assessment of all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be completed using an eligibility criteria and eligibility will be documented in the participant’s NIH Clinical Center chart.   4.4.

Research Procedures History and Physical All participants who appear to be eligible based on the screening assessments and laboratory test results will undergo a physical exam and have their medical history collected to determine their eligibility for the study. In addition, participants will have physical exams performed at NIH visits on weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 36. For offsite visits, the participant’s interval history will be assessed over the phone.  A targeted clinical physical exam will be performed for individuals as necessary to evaluate AEs.   Drug Accountability and Compliance At each NIH visit when participants are taking study drugs (Weeks 1-24), participants will be asked to bring the study medications and empty study medication bottles.  Participants and caregivers will be asked about compliance with the study drug schedule at each study visit.    Specimen Collection a) Acute care, hepatic and mineral panels, and CBC with differential will be performed to monitor clinical status, document drug-related benefits, and detect any potential drug-related toxicities. These tests will be carried out during screening and every subsequent study visit.  b) Creatine Kinase, Amylase, and Lipase These parameters will be measured at screening and at weeks 1, 12, 24, and 36.  c) Hemoglobin A1c, Fasting Lipid Profile, and Urinalysis These parameters will be measured at screening and at weeks 12, 24, and 36.

Previous HIV and HTLV testing results from within one year of the screening visit are acceptable.  e) Hepatitis B and C Testing These parameters will be measured at the screening visit.  f) Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test The pregnancy test will be measured by a standard assay at every scheduled study visit for women of childbearing potential.  g) Research Samples  Research blood and HERV-K:RPP30 ratios will be collected at screening, unless collected as part of another study, and every subsequent study visit.  HERV-K:RPP30 ratios will be measured by [CONTACT_901532]. Avindra Nath.  Levels of urine p75ECD will be measured from research urine collected at screening and Weeks 12, 24, 28, and 36 if the participant is seen at the Clinical Center.  h) ALS genetics panel  If the participant is able to come to the Clinical Center, somatic mutation analysis will be performed.  Whole exome and/or whole genome sequencing including testing for hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 will be performed in the laboratory of [CONTACT_901556] or a CLIA certified laboratory at the participants first study visit at the Clinical Center.   i) PT, PTT These parameters will be measured at the screening visit.  Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and Electromyography (EMG) (Optional) NCS and EMG are standard diagnostic tests that have been used for many decades to diagnose disorders of muscle, nerves, and nerve roots.  Nerve conduction studies are performed using an electrical stimulator to activate the nerve and recording the nerve response in wire leads taped to the skin.  Needle EMG is performed by [CONTACT_2329] a specialized EMG needle to record electrical signals within the muscle. It will be an optional procedure at screening that may be performed for questions of ALS diagnosis by [CONTACT_901533].  Muscle ultrasound (Optional) Muscle ultrasound is performed to gain a better understanding of the muscle architecture and pathology.  The test is performed by [CONTACT_901534].  An image of the muscle or nerve can be seen and evaluated. Muscle ultrasound may be done in select cases.   It will be an optional procedure at screening that may be performed for questions of ALS diagnosis by [CONTACT_901533].  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) EIM is a device (Myolex, Inc) that uses a high frequency, low intensity electrical current via a surface electrode to measure the consequent voltage.  This produces measurements of resistance, reactance and a calculated phase angle.  This is used to follow muscle pathology but is not a diagnostic test. It will be

The quantitative data generated from the EIM will be used as an exploratory outcome measure.  Vital Capacity and Maximal Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_901497] (FVC) and maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (MIP) will be measured. The FVC and MIP will be calculated as the percentage of the predicted vital capacity for a participant’s height, gender, and age. The FVC and MIP will be completed at screening and weeks 12, 24, and 36 if the participant is seen at the Clinical Center.  Questionnaires a) ALSFRS-R The ALSFRS-R is a validated, reproducible, and reliable functional measure that assesses participant function across four domains: bulbar, fine motor, gross motor, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]. It can be performed both in person and by [CONTACT_901535]. The ALSFRS-R takes approximately 5 minutes to complete and will be measured at screening and weeks 12, 24, 28, 36, and optionally at week 48.  b) ALSSQOL-R The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Specific Quality of Life Instrument-Revised (ALSSQOL-R) is a 50-item inventory that measures overall quality of life and six specific domains for patients with ALS. The test is completed by [CONTACT_901536] 15-20 minutes to complete and will be completed at screening and week 24.  c) ALS-CBS   The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Cognitive Behavioral Screen is a validated screening tool that attempts to identify ALS patients at risk for cognitive and/or behavioral impairment by [CONTACT_901537]: initiation and retrieval, concentration, attention, and tracking-monitoring. The questionnaire will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.  It will be an optional measurement at screening and week 24.   Lumbar puncture A lumbar puncture will be completed during the screening evaluations as well as within the time frame of the Week 24 visit if the participant is seen at the Clinical Center.  The procedure may be completed under fluoroscopy or at bedside.  Up to 30 cc of CSF will be collected with each LP.  CSF tests will include cell count, glucose, and protein, and research specimens will be stored for future testing (for example, neurofilament levels).  4.6. End of Participation Participants will continue care with their providers after this study.    Early Termination Visit Participants requiring discontinuation as well as those who elect to discontinue study drugs prior to treatment completion for medical or personal reasons should have an end of treatment visit scheduled as soon as possible after study drugs are discontinued.  Additionally, participants will be given the option of being followed as outlined in Section 4.5 for safety or research labs until the end of the participant’s planned final study visit.

CNS IRB Protocol Template (rev 11.20.14)       page 23 of 41  Any participant who chooses to be followed after discontinuation of study drugs will be followed closely for resolution of active laboratory abnormalities or AEs which are considered related to the study agents.  Participants who discontinue treatment early and opt not to be followed will be removed from the study after it is deemed safe to do so (i.e., abnormal test results return to a safe range).  Sharing of Information with Participants Results of genetic testing will not be disclosed to participants unless it may have a direct medical or reproductive implication for the participant or family.  In that case, genetic counseling will be provided to participants to discuss these implications in more detail.  Results of other procedures will be shared with the participant and with the participant’s ALS physician if follow up is necessary.  Should there be a clinical need to communicate urgently with the participant or his/her physician, this will be pursued via telephone communication in addition to the written communication. 5. Management of Data and Samples 5.1. Storage All collected samples, including blood, urine, and CSF will be coded and stored in secured freezers on the NIH campus. NIH samples will be transferred and retained at the end of the study under a repository protocol after the appropriate IRB approval is received.  Only study investigators will have access to the stored samples and data.  Any loss or destruction of samples will be reported to the IRB. 5.2. Data  This protocol is not subject to the Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy. It does not generate “large-scale” human genomic data as defined in the NIH Supplemental Information to the GDS Policy. Data and samples may be shared with collaborating laboratories at NIH or outside of NIH and/or submitted to NIH-designated repositories and databases if consent for sharing was obtained in the original consent form.  Samples and data will be stripped of identifiers and may be coded (“de-identified”) or unlinked from an identifying code (“anonymized”). When coded data is shared, the key to the code will not be provided to collaborators but will remain at NIH.  Data and samples may be shared with investigators and institutions with an FWA or operating under the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH) and reported at the time of continuing review.  Sharing with investigators without an FWA or not operating under the DoH will be submitted for prospective IRB approval.  Submissions to NIH-sponsored or supported databases and repositories will be reported at the time of Continuing Review.  Submission to non-NIH sponsored or supported databases and repositories will be submitted for prospective IRB approval.  Required approvals from the collaborating institution will be obtained and materials will be shipped in accordance with NIH and federal regulations. 6. Additional Considerations 6.1.

Gene Therapy This protocol does not involve gene therapy. 7. Risks and Discomforts Risks associated with use of darunavir Based on clinical trials,[ADDRESS_1264696] commonly reported adverse drug reactions with darunavir in combination with ritonavir are:  diarrhea (16%), nausea (7%), headache (6%), and abdominal pain (6%).  Drug-induced hepatitis was reported with darunavir at a rate of 0.5% of patients receiving combination darunavir + ritonavir; pre-existing liver dysfunction is a risk factor. Severe skin reactions were reported in 0.4% of patients in clinical trials receiving darunavir (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was diagnosed in 0.1% of cases). Rash of mild-to-moderate severity occurred in 10.3% of participants with a discontinuation rate of 0.5%.  Darunavir has a sulfonamide moiety and must be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy; the incidence and severity of rash were similar in participants with and without a history of sulfonamide allergy.  Other rare, serious side effects include increased bleeding in patients with hemophilia, diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia, and increased cholesterol.  In a clinical trial of darunavir versus lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054] (both combined with ritonavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), 5% of participants discontinued darunavir because of AE or death in comparison with 13% of subjects discontinuing lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054].  Risks associated with use of dolutegravir Based on clinical trials,[ADDRESS_1264697] commonly-reported adverse drug symptoms with dolutegravir are:  insomnia (3%), headache (2%), and fatigue (2%). The most commonly-reported adverse drug-related laboratory abnormalities are: elevated CK (7%), increased lipase (7%), increased liver function tests (4-5%), hyperglycemia (6%), increased bilirubin (3%), and neutropenia (4%).  The most serious complications associated with dolutegravir are potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194].  Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may have worsening development of transaminase elevations.   Other rare (<2%) significant side effects include: abdominal pain and discomfort, myositis, pruritic, hepatitis, renal impairment, and suicidal ideation/behavior.

Risks associated with use of ritonavir Note: The dose of ritonavir used for clinical trials as monotherapy is 600 mg twice daily.  The dose used for this study is 100 mg twice daily.  Potential risks are presented here for the full dose because the risks for the 100 mg dose are described in clinical trial information together with the other protease inhibitors with which it is always prescribed (i.e., the risks of darunavir include the risk of ritonavir).  Potentially fatal skin reactions have occurred with ritonavir.[ADDRESS_1264698] occurred.  Hepatic reactions included significant elevations in liver function tests (>5x ULN) and hepatitis, with pre-existing liver disease being a risk factor.  Other rare (<2%) significant side effects include: diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia, fat redistribution, myopathy and abnormal bleeding in patients with hemophilia.  Common (>5%) side effects with ritonavir include diarrhea (68%), nausea (57%), fatigue (46%), vomiting (32%), abdominal pain (26%), arthralgia (18%), dizziness (15%), elevated triglycerides (9%), myalgia (9%), flatulence (8%), urticaria (8%), elevated liver function tests (8%), blurred vision (6%), and edema (6%).  Risks associated with TAF Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%; all grades) were headache, abdominal pain, fatigue, cough, nausea and back pain. Cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome have been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs. Tenofovir but not TAF has been associated with rare cases of lactic acidosis and hepatotoxicity with steatosis.  Risks of medication interactions with the study drugs The study drugs, particularly the protease inhibitors, have the potential for significant interactions with a number of medications.  A list of significant interactions is found at:  http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/adultandadolescentgl.pdf.  The document contains tables for drug-drug interactions with the protease inhibitors darunavir and ritonavir, reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir, and the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir.   Risks of blood draw There may be some discomfort and bruising at the site of venipuncture. There is a very small risk of fainting. Infection in the area of needle entry is rare.  Risks of Nerve conduction studies (optional) The risks of the electrical stimulation using commercial isolated stimulators are low. Most subjects find electrical nerve shocks to be mildly uncomfortable; it is usually perceived as a brief stinging or tappi[INVESTIGATOR_739148]. The intensities required for nerve conduction studies are usually well tolerated. Risk is minimized by [CONTACT_901538].  Risks of Electromyography (optional)

Sterile needles are used to minimize this risk.  Risks of Nerve and muscle ultrasonography (optional) There are no known medical risks and minimal discomfort associated with this test.  Risks of Electrical Impedance Myography EIM device is placed on the muscle and a high frequency current is delivered to the skin. There is no sensation related to the application of the high frequency impulse.  The only discomforts would be pressure of placing the EIM on the skin.  Risks of vital capacity and maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_901498].  Participants may feel short of breath or lightheaded during testing.  Risks of ALS questionnaires (ALSFRS-R, ALSQOL-R, ALS-CBS)  Some patients may feel frustrated or stressed when answering questions.  There are no other risks with the questionnaires.  Risks of lumbar puncture Subjects may experience a brief pain or tingling sensation in their legs during the procedure if the needle brushes against a nerve. If this happens, the needle will be adjusted. Following the LP, some people have a mild backache at the site of needle insertion. About one-third of people have a headache for a few days following the procedure. Usually the headache is not severe and improves without treatment other than mild pain relievers. Headaches lasting longer than seven days develop in [ADDRESS_1264700] persisted longer. Prolonged headaches may be due to persistent leakage of CSF from the area of the LP and may require a “blood patch.” For a blood patch, venous blood will be removed from the patient and then injected into the area of the back where the lumbar puncture was performed to seal off the CSF leak. We will not perform an LP if neuroimaging suggests that the patient is at increased risk of herniation. If the LP is done under fluoroscopy, there is also a small amount of radiation exposure. Conscious sedation is associated with a small risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_901499]. Patients will be monitored closely for possible side effects and treated with medications or intubation, if necessary. The LP will be performed by [CONTACT_901539].

They might feel differently about their life if they learned that they or their children were at increased risk of a disease, especially if there were no treatments. Their children, brothers or sisters may find out that they are at risk for health problems because of information found out about the participants, which might affect the participants’ relationships with family members.  Other family members may also be affected by [CONTACT_901540]. This information can cause stress, anxiety, or depression.

Clinically actionable findings for the purpose of this study are defined as disorders appearing in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of incidental findings that is current at the time of primary analysis. If participants state that they would like to obtain the results, confirmatory testing will be conducted at a CLIA-certified laboratory either at NIH or elsewhere which will be paid for by [CONTACT_248977]. If the research finding is verified by [CONTACT_129433]-certified laboratory, the participant will be offered the opportunity to receive genetic counseling from an NIH genetic counselor (at our expense) to explain the results. Participants have the option to receive a referral to a local genetic healthcare provider (at their expense). This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.  Genetic information will be kept confidential to the extent possible. The results of genetic testing will be kept in a locked and secured manner at the NIH.     Problems, such as with insurance or employment discrimination, may occur if they disclose information about themselves or agree to have their research records released.  We will not release any information about participants to any physician, insurance company or employer unless they sign a document allowing release of the information. 8. Subject Safety Monitoring The Principal Investigator (PI) and study personnel will be responsible for monitoring individual subjects during participation in study procedures.  Parameters to be monitored Previous experience demonstrated a low human toxicity profile for darunavir, ritonavir, dolutegravir, and TAF. The most frequently and consistently experienced adverse reactions reported are headache, insomnia, abdominal pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], hyperglycemia, increased amylase and lipase, abnormalities in liver function tests and elevated CK levels. Hematologic abnormalities such as decreased absolute neutrophil count and thrombocytopenia are also expected adverse events.   In particular, given the rare risk of severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]; rash with fever, fatigue, malaise, conjunctivitis or other constitutional symptoms), the patient will be instructed to immediately discontinue all the study medications and contact [CONTACT_901541] a severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity symptoms occur.

Medical events typi[INVESTIGATOR_901500] (i.e., typi[INVESTIGATOR_777905]/symptoms that a patient experienced during pre-treatment baseline and their worsening as would be expected from the natural history of ALS) can be regarded as expected events in the course of the current trial.  Because the clinical course of ALS is known to be a steady decline in neurologic and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], we expect participants to have certain ALS-specific events that will not be attributed to study drugs.  Examples of these events include: 1. Increased motor weakness, either defined by [CONTACT_901542], by [CONTACT_3445]’s self report, or by [CONTACT_5292].  Careful attention to the pattern of weakness will be important because ALS causes both upper and lower motor neuron patterns of weakness.   2. Dyspnea.  Dyspnea is a known complication of ALS and may be noted by a decline in vital capacity or participant’s self report.   3. Dysphagia.  Dysphagia is also a known complication of ALS and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_901501].  Dysphagia may be noticed because of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_901502].  Participants who may not be able to tolerate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_901503] 4. 4. Cognitive changes.  10-15% of patients with ALS reach criteria for frontotemporal dementia at some point in their disease course.[ADDRESS_1264704] the study investigators and/or seek medical care if they have any questions or concerns. Participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_901543] 36. After this period of time, participants should report to the investigator only AEs they perceive as possibly related to their participation in this study.   Definitions of AEs and SAEs and assessments of AE severity and causality are listed in Appendix A.  Laboratory monitoring will occur according to the schedule described in Section 4.5. In the event of unexplained clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be repeated immediately and followed up until they have returned to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  If a clear explanation is established it should be recorded.  Toxicity tables/ criteria to be used The Investigator will grade the severity of each AE according to the “Division of Aids Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events” Version 2.1, July 2017 which can be found at:  http://rsc.tech-res.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/Table_for_Grading_Severity_of_Adult_Pediatric_Adverse_Events.pdf

These normal values will not be reported as grade 1 adverse events. The grade 1 values for these tests will be reported as follows:  • Fibrinogen: 100 - 176 mg/dL • Phosphate (low): There is no grade 1 reportable value  • Calcium (low): 1.95 - 2.04 mmol/L • Uric Acid (males): 8.7 – 10.0 mg/dL   Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_901504] A participant must permanently discontinue study drug treatment for any of the following reasons:  1. The participant becomes pregnant (pregnancy test will be performed for female patients with child bearing potential during each study visit as indicated in Section 4.5). If a patient becomes pregnant, treatment must be immediately discontinued. The pregnancy must be reported to the IRB immediately. Information about the participant, the participant’s pregnancy, and the outcome of the pregnancy will also be collected. 2. The participant desires to discontinue study drug treatment under this protocol.  3. If the participant develops a severe skin or hypersensitivity reaction to a study drug(s) he will be instructed to immediately discontinue all study drugs and contact [CONTACT_901544]. 4. Laboratory safety criteria may be used as a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_901505].  Participants may resume the study drugs if the laboratory abnormality resolves within one week.   a. ALT, AST, amylase, or lipase more than three times the upper limit of normal. b. Hemoglobin reduction of >25% of baseline value or Hemoglobin <7.5mg/dl. c. Absolute granulocyte count reduction of >50% of baseline value or absolute granulocyte count of <1000 cells/mm3 d. Any other highly abnormal laboratory finding that is deemed critical by [CONTACT_2413]. 5. The participant has greater than 30% weight loss compared to weight at baseline. 6. The participant has rapid muscle weakness beyond what is expected for the natural course of ALS.   There will be no dose reductions in the study drugs due to intolerance or toxicity, and all four study drugs will be held/discontinued even if the AE is likely attributable to only one study drug.  The reasons for discontinuation of the study drugs must be recorded in the participant’s Clinical Center patient file. If discontinuation was because of an AE, the patient will be followed until the event is resolved or stabilized. If the discontinuation was because of pregnancy, the participant will be followed until after the birth.  Criteria for individual subject withdrawal from the study Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator also has the right to withdraw participants from the study in the event of an intercurrent illness, AEs, treatment failure, protocol violations, administrative reasons, or other reasons.

Missing data plan Missing data can impact interpretation of the study data. Values for missing data will not be imputed.  Any participant with missing data due to premature discontinuation of the study drugs (see Section 10.5 below) will be considered a failure at the time points on, or following, the date of discontinuation.   Where appropriate, safety data for participants not completing the study will be included in summary statistics. For example, if a participant received study drugs, the participant will be included in a summary of adverse event.  If safety laboratory results for a participant are missing for any reason at a time point, the participant will be excluded from the calculation of summary statistics for that time point. If the participant is missing a pre-dose value, then the participant will be excluded from the calculation of summary statistics for the pre-dose value and the change from pre-dose values.  10.2. Power analysis Accrual number request Sample size:   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_901506] 1000 HERV-K copi[INVESTIGATOR_901507] (n=5), there is an average percent decline in serum concentration of 38% with a standard deviation of 50%. Only individuals with greater than 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_901508]. The average percent decline of 38% is close to the estimated minimally biologically meaningful percent decline of 50%.   To calculate the number of subjects needed, we will power using an inflated standard deviation, due to the issues with using standard deviation from a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_901509] a study. Browne (1995) indicates that using an 80% percent UCL on standard deviation will provide a sample size sufficient to achieve planned power in at least 80% percent of trials, and we will use that adjustment here.[ADDRESS_1264708] deviation is 76%. We estimated that untreated, these individuals will have a 0% decline from baseline.

Patients who voluntarily stop study drugs before [ADDRESS_1264711] selection The investigational nature and objectives of this trial, the procedures and treatments involved, as well as the attendant risks, discomforts, and potential benefits will be carefully explained to the patient. A signed consent form will be obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_901510]. It will be carefully explained to patients that they may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  All adult ALS patients fulfilling all inclusion criteria and for whom none of the exclusion criteria are applicable, irrespective of gender or race, are included in the trial. Patients 18 years and older will be included in the trial as long as they are willing and able to comply with all the aspects of testing and treatment.   11.2. Justification for the exclusion of children Children less than 18 years old are excluded from the trial. Since ALS is exceptionally rare in the second decade, pediatric cases might not be representative of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_901511].   11.3. Justification for the exclusion of those who lack consent capacity  Due to the complex nature of this clinical trial, and the off-label use of the study medications, those who are cannot provide informed consent will not be allowed to participate in this trial.   11.4. Justification for sensitive procedures Genetic testing will be completed as part of this protocol. Approximately 40% of familial ALS and 10% of sporadic ALS cases are associated with a known genetic mutation. It is likely that other genetic mutations account for even larger percentages of familial and sporadic ALS cases. Patients with a C9ORF72 mutation are more likely to have associated frontotemporal dementia; however, there are few other phenotypic differences between cases with genetic mutations. Therefore, it will be difficult to look for genetic differences that could account for the variability in suppression of the HERV-K RNA without assessing for the known genetic mutations.  11.5.

Adverse Event definitions Definition of Adverse Event (AE) An AE “is any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen.” An AE is a term that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analyses.  Severity of Adverse events Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The DAIDS toxicity table displays Grades 1 through 4 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Potentially life-threatening AE (SAE)  Grade 1:  Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social & functional activities Grade 2:  Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social & functional activities Grade 3:  Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social & functional activities Grade 4:  Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self-care functions OR Medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death   Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect at any dose, that: • results in death,  • is life threatening,  • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  • requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]‡ or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], • results in cancer, • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant, • is deemed, by [CONTACT_093], an important or serious medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above should be considered serious (i.e., intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.)  Assessment of causality Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_901548], if any, to the study medication. The degree of certainty with which an adverse event can be attributed to the study medication (or alternative causes, e.g., natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, etc.) will be determined by [CONTACT_615782]: • Reaction of similar nature previously observed with this type of medication. • The event reported in the literature for similar types of medication. • Subject’s underlying clinical state or other medical conditions (defined further in Section 8.1).

The causal relationship, if any, to study medication will be defined by [CONTACT_739230]:  Assessment Definition Definitely There is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a relationship between study medication and AE (without determining the extent of probability); there are no other more likely causes and study medication is suspected to have contributed to the AE. Probable AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604] (i.e., clinical condition, environmental/toxic factors or other treatments). Possible AE can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604] (as mentioned above). Unlikely AE occurs within an unusual time frame of administration of study medication and can also be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604] (as mentioned above). Unrelated There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_177872] a relationship between study medication and AE; there are other more likely causes and study medication is not suspected to have contributed to the AE.

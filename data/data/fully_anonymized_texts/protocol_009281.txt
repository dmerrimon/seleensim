Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September  2015  Page 4 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL    Subjects who are currently receiving denosumab in study 20040215 will receive denosumab at a 
dose of 120 mg dosing according to their current Q4W schedule and will not receive any loading doses (ie, study day 8 and 15).  
For subjects with a complete tumor resection, denosumab treatment continues for 6 doses  after 
pathological confirmation of partial response or complete response.  In all other cases, 
denosumab treatment continues until confirmation of disease progression, investigator’s 
recommendation of discontinuation, [COMPANY_010]’s recommendation of discontinuation, the subject’s decision to discontinue for any reason, or administration of any of the proscribed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
During the time the study is still open, re- treatment  may be allowed for subjects who 
demonstrated a response to denosumab and are currently not receiving denosumab treatment (eg, in the case of recurrent disease while subject is in the safety follow up phase or subjects that 
have completed the study and have later experienced disease progression).  The re -treatment 
decision including the use of the loading dose and discontinuation of therapy will be handled on a case -by-case basis; prior authorization from [COMPANY_010] is required.  Subjects must meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to being considered for re -treatment.  
To evaluate the long -term safety profile of denosumab, data (treatment plus follow -up) will be 
collected for all subjects enrolled through November [ADDRESS_1235943] ( Section 3.4.2 ).  For subjects enrolled after 
November 2012 (PK substudy), data (treatment plus follow -up) will be collected until the end of 
the clinical study ( Section 3.4.2 ).  
Subjects who discontinue(d) investigational product will have an End of Treatment visit approximately [ADDRESS_1235944].  Thereafter, they will complete safety follow -up visits approximately every 6 months (± 1 month) for the first year and 
every 12 months (± 1 month) thereafter until the end of the clinical study ( Section 3.4.2 ).  During 
the safety follow -up phas e, subjects will be asked about serious adverse events, adverse 
events of interest, and disease treatments and outcomes ( Section 9.2). 
Prior to Amendment 7 IRB/IEC approval, subjects currently in the safety follow -up in study 
20040215 will continue on the safety follow -up in this study for up to 2 years after their end of 
study visit on study 20040215.  The total length of safety follow -up on this  study for patients 
enrolling from the safety follow -up phase of [COMPANY_010] study 20040215 will be 2 years less the time 
spent in safety follow -up on study 20040215.  Upon the approval of Amendment 7, subjects who 
enrolled in 20062004 from the 20040215 study will also follow the 20062004 schedule, and complete the assessments as described in Appendix  A. 
Approximately 50 sites will participate.  
Primary and Sec ondary Endpoints:   
Safety profile of denosumab characterized in terms of the type, frequency, and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities for  each cohort .

free liquid in open label glass.  Denosumab will be administered as a SC injection.  
All subjects should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (at least 
500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D),  except in the case of pre- existing hypercalcemia.  
Control Group:    
None 
Procedures:    
Study procedures will only be performed after written independent ethics committee / institutional 
review board (IEC/IRB) approved informed consent is obtained from each subject.   
The site will complete an Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Worksheet for each subject to be enrolled to 
this study .  Once this worksheet is submitted  to [COMPANY_010] and signed as approved, the site will 
receive a written enrollment confirmation from [COMPANY_010] allowing the specific subject to enroll in the 
study .  The approval process is required for new enrolling subjects  and subjects considered for 
retreatment .  Subjects enrolling from [COMPANY_010] study [ADDRESS_1235945] complete the 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Worksheet, but do not need to complete the approval process .  The 
site must receive the signed enrollment confirmation form back from [COMPANY_010] before dosing may 
begin.  
The following procedures will be performed at screening for all subjects (except 20040215 safety follow -up subjects) enrolled to the study: medical history; Karnofsky performance status; physical 
exam; disease status; pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential; serum collection for anti-denosumab antibody assay (baseline); patient reported outcomes (baseline).  Local 
laboratory values, adverse events, concomitant medications, and treatment procedures will be collected.  Subjects enrolled to the PK substudy will also have serum and urine collection for PK 
and biomarker assessments.   A copy of the standard of care imaging reports obtained within 
[ADDRESS_1235946]’s 
medical record.  H istopathology reports dated within [ADDRESS_1235947]’s medical record .  Select 
historical and select on-study imaging performed as standard of care will be required to be sent to 
a central imaging vendor for evaluation of disease response. 
Statistical Considerations:    
The sample size for this study is determined by [CONTACT_883462] .  
It is anticipated that approximately [ADDRESS_1235948]:  Denosumab (AMG 162)

CONFIDENTIAL    (Szendroi  et al, 2003; Szendroi , 2004 ).  Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) develops after 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_883432].  However, cases occur rarely in skeletally mature adolescents (ie, 
adolescents who have closed epi[INVESTIGATOR_728044]) . 
Symptoms that accompany prim ary GCTB  include localized pain, tenderness, and 
swelling and the osteolysis may lead to pathologic fractures, decreased joint motion and impaired function.  Lesions that originate in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_883433].  
Surgery is the definitive therapy for GCTB  and about 80% of primary GCTB  patients 
have lesions amenable to surgical resection.  Although en bloc excisions of the tumor 
may be curative, they also carry significant morbidity (eg, amputation of a limb, joint 
resection) and greatly influence quality of life.  Curettage procedures with and without 
bone graft may allow for complete resection of the tumor and preservation of the limb or 
joint, but the risk for recurrence is greater.  Larger GCTB  lesions may not be amenable 
to curettage resections and may result in severe morbid procedures.  In addition, lesions in bones of the hand and distal radius have the highest rate of metastasis even with 
en bloc excision.  Overall, the risk for recurrence is estimated at 10 to 20 percent after  
en bloc excision and at 40% to 75% ( Malawer et al, 2005) after curettage, albeit a less 
debilitating procedure.  
The GCTB  lesion has a wide transition zone and poorly defined borders.  In order to 
decrease the risk for recurrence with curettage resections, aggressive adjuvant surgical 
procedures are usually necessary.  These procedures are used to remove normal bone 
and ensure a wider surgical margin beyond the transition zone.  Adjuvant procedures such as cryosurgery, phenol instillation, high-speed burr, reconstitution with cement, and/or radiation therapy have been described.  Side effects may include localized bone 
necrosis, increased risk for fracture, and delayed union of bone.  Radiation therapy may 
be used and carries the risk of malignant induction to the bone. 
Prognosis for GCTB  is excellent if it does not recur.  Recurrent GCTB  commonly 
manifests as localized recurrence, however distant recurrence/metastasis may also 
occur.  The definitive therapy for local recurrences is also surgery.  More aggres sive 
surgery for local recurrences carries significant morbidity and patients with local recurrences are at increased risk for subsequent localized and distant recurrences.

CONFIDENTIAL  Eventually, patients become surgically unsalvageable.  For some patients with pri mary 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_883434], there may be no definitive surgical option.  In these cases, 
treatment options are limited.  Radiation therapy may control local tumor growth; 
however, there is a risk for malignant transformation.  Systemic therapy with 
chem otherapy is of limited value and serial embolization of larger lesions may provide 
symptomatic relief.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_1235966] in GCTB  is not prognostic 
for recurrence or metastasis.  Giant- cell rich osteosarcoma may be difficult to 
differentiate from benign GCTB .  Likewise, the presence of giant cells in osteosarcoma 
is not prognostic for better outcomes.  A grading scale was described; grade I (completely benign), grade II (borderline), and grade III (frankly sarcomatous).  Grade I and II have not been correlated with decreased risk for recurrence or metastasis 
(Malawer  et al, 2005). 
2.1.3 Pathophysiology of Giant Cell Tumor of Bone (GCTB)  
Giant Cell Tumors  of bone (GCTB) are highly vascularized, expansile osteolytic lesions 
with indistinct borders and wide transitional zones.  The histological appearance of giant cell tumors includes three distinct cell types; multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells, spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853]-shaped osteoblast-like stromal cells and monocytes (likely precursors of the 
giant cells).  Although the name [CONTACT_883488] “giant cells” are the neoplastic 
component, the true neoplastic component remains unknown and controversial.  The 
similarity in appearance of giant cells to normal osteoclasts suggests that the stromal component (spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853]-shaped cells) may be the true neoplastic component and that the 
giant cells are the reactive component (Morgan et al, 2005; Zheng et al, 2001).    
In archival samples (n = 33) of primary and recurrent GCTB , RANKL was expressed and 
detected by [CONTACT_9064]  (IHC)  and in situ hybridization.  RANKL expression 
was observed in the stromal  component and osteoprotegerin and RANK were expressed 
on the giant cells.  In addition, soluble factors, presumably RANKL, secreted from 
stromal cells of GC TBs are able to induce osteoclastogenesis from peripheral blood 
monocytes (Nishimura et al, 2005).  Although TGF-b1, MCP -1, TNF IL-1, 6, 11, 17, 18, 
MCS -F and PTHrP are expressed in the tumor, none of these factors are known to 
induce osteoclast differentiation.  Endothelial cells of normal vessel did not express RANK or RANKL (Roudier  et al, CTOS  2006).

CONFIDENTIAL  2.2 Denosumab Background 
Perturbations in the balance between bone formation and resorption can lead to 
generalized osteoporosis (resulting from estrogen deficiency and aging) or local bone lysis (resulting from rheumatoid arthritis and bone metastases).  RANK -RANK ligand 
(RANKL) system has been identified as an essential mediator of osteoclast formation, 
function, and survival ( Teitelbaum  et al, 2003).  RANKL  binds RANK on osteoclasts or 
osteoclast precursors to stimulate or promote differentiation into osteoclasts and activate mature osteoclasts to resorb bone.  Therefore, RANKL  is a therapeutic target for 
diseases associated with increased bone resorption. 
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL  that binds with high 
affinity (Kd 3 x 10
-12 M) and specificity to the soluble and cell membrane- bound forms of 
human RANKL.  Denosumab is highly specific because it binds only to RANKL  and not 
to other members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, including TNFα, TNF β, 
TNF-related apoptosis -inducing ligand, or CD40 ligand (Elliott  et al, 2006 ).  Denosumab 
binding prevents the activation of RANK and inhibits the formation, activation, and 
survi val of osteoclasts.  As a consequence, bone resorption and cancer -induced bone 
destruction are reduced.   
Refer to the latest version of the investigator brochure for additional and updated 
information on denosumab background, clinical experience, and safety information. 
2.2.1 Clinical Experience With Denosumab in Giant Cell Tumor  of Bone 
(GCTB)  
The Phase [ADDRESS_1235967] month of treatment.   
The primary endpoint was tumor response, defined as complete or near complete 
elimination of giant cells or in the absence of histology data, a lack of radiologic progression (single largest dimension < 20% increase by [CONTACT_20420] [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). 
Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September 2015  Page 18 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL  The primary analysis was conducted of 37 subjects (20 female) with a data cut off date 
of 07 April 2 008.  Of these 37 subjects, 35 were evaluable for response to treatment.  
Eighty -six percent (30/35) of subjects had a tumor response:  20 of 20 by [CONTACT_27183], and 
10 of 15 by [CONTACT_268899].  Adverse events (AEs) were reported in [ADDRESS_1235968] diagnosed with 
giant cell sarcoma who developed disease progression (not treatment-related) during the off treatment follow -up period.  No treatment-related serious AEs were reported. 
2.2.2 Summary of Effects of OPG -Fc Treatment on Tooth Eruption and 
Long Bone Geometry in Neonate Rats 
Genetic ablation of RANKL in knockout mice, and lifelong inhibition of RANKL by [CONTACT_883464], was associated with deleterious changes in long bone growth, geometry 
and/or strength ( Ominsky et al, 2009; Li et al, 2000; Kong et al, 1999). RANKL knockout 
mice, but not OPG transgenic rats, also exhibited failure of tooth eruption 
(Kong et al, 1999). The pharmacologic effects of RANKL inhibition on tooth eruption and 
on long bone growth, geometry, and strength were therefore evaluated in several 
nonclinical studies in neonatal rats. RANKL inhibition in neonatal rats via administration 
of OPG -Fc or RANK -Fc resulted in reduced weight gain, growth plate abnormalities, 
reduced bone length, increased bone mass and increased structural bone strength 
parameters. Although material bone strength parameters were on average unchanged, femoral toughness was consistently reduced. Inhibited tooth eruption and impaired root 
developmen t were also observed with doses of OPG -Fc that effected a dramatic 
reduction in bone resorption. These effects were partially reversible upon discontinuation 
of OPG -Fc, however, extrinsic long bone strength was reduced and reduced bone 
length, femur toughness, and abnormal tooth root development persisted.  
Overexpression of OPG in OPG -transgenic (OPG -Tg) rats prenatally through to skeletal 
maturity resulted in a suboptimal long bone phenotype. These data suggest that the use 
of denosumab in the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_883435], decreased bone growth, decreased bone toughness, and impaired dentition.  
2.3 Rationale 
GCTB  is a rare disease characterized clinically by [CONTACT_883465] -nucleated giant cells that are similar to osteoclasts, the cells that 
mediate bone destruction.  The tumor cells express RANKL and its receptor, RANK.  
The RANK/RANKL pathway is an essential mediator of osteoclast function, formation and survival.  Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody of RANKL, inhibits 
Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1235969]- mediated bone destruction and may provide therapeutic benefit for patients 
with giant cell tumor.   
For subjects with surgically unsalvageable GCTB , current treatment options are limited 
and may include treatments (radiation, embolization, chemotherapy) that lead to 
significant disability, poor quality of life and possibly death.  Bisphosphonates are currently under investigation in this subject population; however, only limited preclinical and clinical data are currently available ( Cheng et al, 2004). 
Study 20040215 was an open-label, phase 2 safety and efficacy study of denosumab in subjects (n = 37 ) with recurrent or unresectable GCTB .  The  primary analysis, 
demonstrated that denosumab has significant biological activity in GCTB  based on 
assessment of histologic or radiologic response.  The safety profile of denosumab in this study appeared to be consistent with that observed in other settings.  
The potential elimination of osteoclasts by [CONTACT_883466], inhibit the progression of GCTB  and potentially 
improve clinical outcomes for these subjects.  
In addition, for patients with surgically salvageable GCTB  that require severe morbid 
procedures, treatment with denosumab may reduce the size of the lesion and improve surgical options to allow limb and joint-sparing procedures . 
There have been rare reported cases  of GCTB  in adolescents.  Giant Cell Tumor of 
Bone (GCTB)  usually occurs  in skeletally mature adolescents after the epi[INVESTIGATOR_883436], and all adolescent subjects enrolled into this study will have radiological 
confirmation of skeletal maturity.  No further long bone growth is anticipated after 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_883437] e closed.  In the adolescent subset, eruption of adult dentition may 
not be complete, but in the majority of cases the non-erupted teeth are likely to be 
limited to non-essential wisdom teeth, which are absent from many adults.  There are 
few treatment options for adolescents with mature skeletons and GCTB .  Based on the 
seriousness of GCTB  and the limited treatment options, [COMPANY_010] believes that this 
protocol, which includes adolescents with mature skeletons and GCTB , presents greater 
than minimal risk, but also presents the prospect of direct benefit to the subject.  
2.3.[ADDRESS_1235970]:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September 2015  Page 20 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL    [COMPANY_010] study 20040215.   Subjects enrolling from study 20040215 will receive 
denosumab at a dose of 120 mg dosing according to their current Q4W schedule and 
will not receive any loading doses (ie, study day 8 and 15). 
The selection of the dose and schedule of denosumab was based on safety, 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data obtained from the phase 1 and 2 studies 
described above.  Specifically, study 20040113 provided a comprehensive dataset guiding the dose selection for subjects with bone metastases.  All the denosumab arms 
showed biological activity in reducing bone resorption, which was comparable to that 
seen with the IV bisphosphonate arm.  The rate of skeletal -related events in the 
denosumab arms was similar to that observed in the bisphosphonate arm.  Among the denosumab doses and schedules evaluated, the regimen of 120 mg every 4 weeks was 
associated with maximum reduction of the bone turnover marker uNTX by [CONTACT_5875] 13, the 
primary endpoint in the study.  
Unlike the 30 mg every 4-week dosing, the 120 mg every 4- week schedule avoided low 
exposures of denosumab (eg, serum levels below 4000 ng/mL) that could potentially 
translate into reduced efficacy in some subjects based on preliminary population PK/PD 
modeling of the phase 2 data.  Denosumab was found to be safe and well tolerated in all 
study arms.  While no symptomatic hypocalcemia was reported in study 20040113, the 120 mg every 4-week schedule (n = 41) appeared preferable as no grade 2 or higher 
hypocalcemia was recorded as opposed to 5, grade 2 and one, grade 3 hypocalcemia in the denosumab 180 mg every 4- week treatment group (n = 43). 
The subjects on this study have active GCTB  with surgically unsalvageable or large 
GCTB  lesions.  The goal of denosumab treatment is to reduce or halt the growth of the 
GCTB  lesion and prevent further osteolysis.  The pharmacodynamic goal is to quickly 
attain target serum concentrations of denosumab and maintain a constant level of 
maximal s uppression of osteoclast activity and bone resorption. 
Based on the PK model, denosumab [ADDRESS_1235971]:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1235972] a similar adverse event profile as adults in this lower  
weight range.   
2.4 Hypotheses 
It is anticipated that denosumab, an inhibitor of RANKL, will be a well -tolerated treatment 
for patients with surgically unsalvageable GCTB  disease, and patients with surgically 
salvageable disease whose planned on-study surgery is associated with severe 
morbidity.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a  phase 2, international, multi -center, open-label study in subjects with GCTB , 
receiving denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC Q4W with a loading dose of 120 mg SC 
on study days 8 and 15.   There are 3 cohorts in this study:  
•Cohort #1:  Subjects with surgically unsalvageable disease ( eg, sacral, spi[INVESTIGATOR_883431] ,
or multiple lesions including pulmonary metastases)
•Cohort #2: Subjects with surgically salvageable disease whose planned  on-study
surgery is associated with severe morbi dity (eg, joint resection, limb amputation, or
hemipelvectomy)
•Cohort #3:  Subjects who are currently participating in [COMPANY_010] study 20040215 giant
cell tumor study who are eligible to enroll
Subjects who are currently receiving denosumab in study 20040215 w ill receive 
denosumab at a dose of 120 mg dosing according to their current Q4W schedule and 
will not receive any loading doses (ie, study day 8 and 15). 
For subjects with a complete tumor resection, denosumab treatment continues for 
6 doses after pathological confirmation of partial response (PR) or complete response 
(CR) .  In all other cases, denosumab treatment continues until confirmation of disease 
progression, investigator’s recommendation of discontinuation, [COMPANY_010]’s  
recommendation of discontinuation, the subject’s decision to discontinue for any reason, 
or administration of any of the proscribed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
During the time the study is still open,  re-treatment may be allowed for subjects who 
demonstrated a response to denosumab and are currently not receiving denosumab 
treatment (eg, in the case of recurrent disease while subject is in the safety follow up 
phase or subjects that have completed the study and have later experienced disease progression).  The re-treatment decision including the use of the loading dose and 
Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September 2015  Page 22 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL  discontinuation of therapy will be handled on a case-by -case basis; prior authorization 
from [COMPANY_010] is required.  Subjects must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to 
being considered for re-treatment.   
To evaluate the long-term safety profile of denosumab, data (treatment plus follow -up) 
will be collected for all subjects enrolled through November [ADDRESS_1235973] (Section 3.4.2).   For 
subjects enrolled after November 2012 (PK substudy), data (treatment plus follow-up) 
will be collected until the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2).   
Subjects who discontinue(d) investigational product will have an End of Treatment visit approximately [ADDRESS_1235974].  Thereafter, they will complete safety follow -up visits approximately every 6 months (± 1 month) for the 
first year and every 12 months (± 1 month) thereafter until the end of the clinical study 
(Section 3.4.2). 
Prior to Amendment 7 IRB/IEC approval, subjects currently in the safety follow-up in 
study [ADDRESS_1235975] within 6 months  of site initiation may be terminated.  
3.3 Number of Subjects 
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  
The sample size for this study is governed by [CONTACT_883462] .  It is anticipated that approximately [ADDRESS_1235976]:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September 2015  Page 23 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL  approx imately 20 subjects (approximately 10 adolescents and approximately 10 adults) 
will be enrolled to the PK substudy.  
No more than 30 subjects will enroll from the [COMPANY_010] study 20040215.  No adolescents 
will enroll into cohort 3, since all subjects participating in study 20040215 are adults 
(≥ 18 years of age). 
3.[ADDRESS_1235977] enrolled through November 2012 (before Amendment 7 ), the total 
duration of a subject’s participation will be at least [ADDRESS_1235978].  For subjects enrolled 
after November 2012 (PK substudy), data (treatment plus follow -up) will be collected 
until the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2).    
The total duration of this study from start of enrollment to end of follow -up for the last 
subject is expected to be approximately 9 years (approximately 4 years of enrollment 
prior to Amendment 7, and approximately 5 years of treatment and follow -up).  
3.4.2 End of Study  (EOS) 
The end of the clinical study  for all subjects  will occur when all subjects enrolled through 
November 2012 (before Amendment 7) have completed at least [ADDRESS_1235979].  Study enrollment (prior to 
Amendment 7) concluded in November 2012; therefore the final study visits will be 
conducted and the study is anticipated to end by  [CONTACT_883467] 2017.  
Subjects enrolled in the PK substudy will complete treatment and/or follow -up at the 
same time as subjects included prior to Amendment 7. 
4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (ie, age, sex, 
and race), date, and outcome of the screening process (eg, enrolled into study, reason 
for ineligibility, or refused to participate). 
Before any study -specific procedure, the appropriate written informed consent must be 
obtained (see Section 12.1).  For adolescents , in addition to written informed consent, 
the assent of the adolescent also must be obtained if requested by [CONTACT_38893]/independent ethics committee.

Exclusion Criteria for 20040215 subjects:  
4.2.[ADDRESS_1235985] to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures  
5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects may be entered into the study, [COMPANY_010] requires a copy of the site’s 
written independent ethics committee/institutional review board (IEC/IRB)  approval of the 
protocol, informed consent form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment 
material, if applicable (see Section 12.3).  
All subjects who enter into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent) will receive a unique subject identification 
number before any study procedures are performed.  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed at the time of 
rescreening or enrollment.  Subjects enrolling from the [ADDRESS_1235986]:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1235987] 3 digits will represent a 
protocol identifier (ie, 204) and will be identical for all sites.  The next 3 digits will 
represent the site number (ie, 101, 102, 103, etc.) and will be identical for all subjects at 
a particular site.  The last [ADDRESS_1235988] identification and will be 
assigned in sequential order, per site, as subjects are screened (ie, 00 1, 002, 003, etc.).  
Therefore, the first subject to enter screening at site 101 will receive the number 
204101001; the second subject at this site will receive the number 204101002, etc.  
Once the site deems the subject is eligible for enrollment to the study and all screening procedures have been completed, the Eligibility Criteria Worksheet (found in the Regulatory Binder) and a case history of the subject’s disease must be completed and 
faxed to the US or European Sponsor Contact (see cover page for contact [CONTACT_3031]) 
as appropriate, for approval before the first dose of investigational product can be 
administered to any  subject.   The approval process is required for new enrolling subjects  
and subjects considered for retreatment .  Subjects enrolling from [COMPANY_010] study 
[ADDRESS_1235989] complete the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Worksheet, but do not need to 
complete the approval process.  The case history must include the treatment history , 
including original and translated imaging reports and histopathology reports (specimen 
source must be clearly identified in the report) .  
Those subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Screening visit and who receive an enrollment confir mation from [COMPANY_010] may be enrolled into the study and 
begin the treatment period.  A  subject is considered enrolled into the study once the 
eligibility criteria worksheet is signed by [CONTACT_11337].  
5.[ADDRESS_1235990] management will be automatically resupplied to the sites through an interactive 
voice response system (IVRS).  
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
Denosumab is considered to be the investigational product in this study; therefore, drug accountability must be obtained on all used and unused denosumab vials.  For further 
details regarding preparation and administration of the investigational product, refer to the Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), which is a document 
external to this protocol. 
Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1235991] Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Denosumab is to be administered by a licensed healthcare professional at a dose of 
120 mg SC Q4W wit h a loading dose of 120 mg SC on study days 8 and 15.  Subjects 
enrolling from study 20040215 will receive denosumab at a dose of 120 mg dosing 
according to their current Q4W schedule and will not receive any loading doses 
(ie, study day 8 and 15). 
6.2 Dose Escalation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_883438], if the study day s 8 and 15 doses are delayed more than 8 calendar 
days, it will be considered a missed dose and recorded as such on the electronic case 
report form (eC RF).  The next dose is to be given at the next scheduled visit date (based 
on study day 1).  There must be at least 4 days (ie, 96 hours) between the study day s 1, 
8, and 15 doses (ie, ±  3 days from the scheduled visit date).  
For Q4W doses, the planned dose may be given up to [ADDRESS_1235992] 21 days between doses.  I f a planned dose 
(eg, week 5, week 9, etc.) is delayed more than 7 calendar days, it will be considered a 
misse d dose and recorded as such on the eCRF .  The next dose is to be given at the 
next scheduled visit date (based on study day 1).  
For subjects with a complete tumor resection, denosumab treatment continues for 6 doses after pathological confirmation of partial response or complete response.  In all 
other cases, denosumab treatment continues until confirmation of disease progression, investigator’s recommendation of discontinuation, [COMPANY_010]’s  recommendation of 
discontinuation, the subject’s decision to discontinue for any reason, or administration of any of the proscribed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  See Section 3.[ADDRESS_1235993] is recommended to  be withheld 30 days prior to 
any elective invasive oral/ dental procedure.  Investigational product administration is 
recommended to be withheld until documented evidence of complete mucosal healing 
following any invasive oral/ dental procedure.  Subjects with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)  on study may temporarily or permanently 
discontinu e investigational product at investigator discretion.  Re-exposure to 
investigational product may occur if the investigator and sponsor agree subject safety 
will not be compromised. 
The dosing schedule is described by a schema in the protocol synopsis.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.3 Dosage Adjustments 
There will be no dose adjustments allowed in this study.  
6.4 Concomitant Therapy  (Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements)  
All subjects should be adequately supplemented with calcium and Vitamin D (at 
least 500 mg of calcium and 400 IU of Vitamin D ), except in the case of pre-existing 
hypercalcemia.  Due to differences in regional availability, a dosage form of vitamin D 
that gives an equivalent of at least [ADDRESS_1235994] is on study  (embolization immediately prior to 
planned definitive surgery [ e.g. to improve operative hemostas is] is allowed in 
accordance with local guidelines ).  Use of any unapproved (ie, no marketing 
authorization has been granted) investigational product (other than denosumab) or 
device is not allowed until after all study  assessments are completed. 
Invasive dental procedures should be avoided.  If a subject undergoes an invasive 
dental procedure while on study, a clinical decision to continue the subject on investigational product must be documented in the medical chart. 
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain an IEC/IRB -approved, signed, 
informed consent from all subjects before any protocol -related procedures are 
performed.  
Study visits during the treatment period will occur every 4 weeks until the end of 
treatment w ith an additional visit at study days 8 and 15.  For those subjects enrolling 
from the 20040215 study, study visits will continue at every 4 week intervals until the end 
of treatment.  When possible, all assessments/procedures during the treatment phase of 
study should be obtained within 7 calendar days or less of the specified study visit (except during the loading dose period), relative to study day 1.  Every effort should be made to keep subjects on the study schedule as planned from study day  1.

Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September 2015  Page 32 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL  The uNTx will be corrected for urine creatinine by [CONTACT_57148] a ratio.  Using the uNTx as 
reported in units of nM and urine creatinine in units of mg/dL, the creatinine 
measurement will be multiplied by 0.0884, and used to generate the corrected ratio.  The 
resulting equation will be:  uNTx/Cr (nM BCE/mM) = uNTx/(Cr*0.0884). 
Urine will be obtained on a subset of approximately 20 subjects (approximately 
10 adolescent and 10 adult subjects) at baseline (prior to administration of 
investigational product on study day 1)  and on study as outlined in the schedule of 
assessments  (Appendix  A).  
Urine collection instructions 
A urine sample will be collected from subjects after the first void and preferably in the 
morning.  It is recommended that urine samples be collected in the clinic, if feasible.  If 
the subject is to collect the urine sample at home, he/she will need to be provided with 
containers for sample collection and for transporting the sample to the site on the day of collection.  Subject instructions will be provided on how and when to collect the sample, 
recording the time of collection, and storing the sample (refrigerated) until it is brought to the study site for processing.  
7.7.5 Anti-denosumab Antibody Assay 
Serum for anti -denosumab antibody assay will be collected at baseline and as outlined 
on the schedule of assessments (Appendix  A).  
Prior to Amendment 7 IRB/IEC approval, for subjects who were in the safety  follow -up of 
study 20040215 and are enrolling in this study, serum samples for anti -denosumab 
antibody assay will  be collected approximately every 6 months for up to 24 months after 
the end of study visit in the 20040215 study.  Upon the approval of Amendment 7, 
subjects who enrolled in 20062004 from the 20040215 study will also follow the 
20062004 schedule, and complete the assessments as described in Appendix  A. 
[COMPANY_010] Inc., or its designee, will be responsible for analyzing serum samples for the assessment of anti -denosumab antibodies.  [COMPANY_010] Biological Sample Management 
(BSM) will provide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_883439].
  These samples may also be used for future biomarker 
development testing.  
7.8 Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any serum or urine samples collected according to the s chedule of a ssessments 
(Appendix  A) can be analyzed for any of the tests  outlined in  the protocol and for any 
Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1236009]’s identification number for the study.  Results are stored in a secure 
database to ensure confidentiality.   
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand Giant 
Cell Tumor of Bone, the dose response and/or prediction of response to denosumab,  
characterize antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_1236010]’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947].  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining serum or urine samples and any other components from the cells can be located and 
destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337]. 
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  If a commercial product is developed from this research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definitions 
9.1.1 Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.” (ICH E6:1.2)  
This definition of adverse events is broadened in this study to include any such occurrence (eg, sign, symptom, or diagnosis) or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition from the time that a subject has signed informed consent to the time of enrollment to or initiation of investigational product.  
This definition of adverse events also includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition (eg, cancer, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has  increased in severity, frequency, or duration of 
the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes. 
Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September 2015  Page 37 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL  Interventions for pretreatment conditions (eg, elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered adverse events. 
Pregnancy is not considered an adverse event (see Appendix  C for reporting any 
pregnancy). 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from 
values before the study.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical 
significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse events; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in pr ior 
therapy are considered adverse events.  
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of 
the following serious criteria: 
•is fatal
•is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of de ath)
•requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•other significant medical hazard
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37349] “serious” is any inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256170] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health care facility excluding 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883442] -specified procedures ( eg, to perform resection 
on affected limb/region with giant cell tumor) or blood product transfusions, if being administered for cancer -related treatment.  However, prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883443]-admission after the subject has been discharged would be considered a Serious Adverse Event.  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_883444].  
Any adverse event that does not meet one of the definitions of serious (eg, emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or requires urgent investigation) may be considered by [CONTACT_883471] “other significant medical hazard” criterion for classification as a 
serious adverse event.  Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.2 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (as defined in 
Section 9.1 and as further specified below) and adverse events of interest  
(Section 7.11) observed by [CONTACT_883472] 
(excluding cohort 3 subjects), treatment, through the first 6-month safety  follow up visit  
as well as through the end of safety follow -up phase for adverse events of interest  
(Section 3.4.2) are collected and recorded in the subjects’ medical records and in 
designated study documents ( ie, eCRF, and, on the serious adverse event report 
(SAER) form for serious adverse events).  These adverse events  will include all serious  
and non serious adverse events (as defined in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2) that occur after  
the subject has signed the informed consent form .   
The following adverse event attributes must be assigned by [CONTACT_093]:  adverse 
event diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known); event description (with detail appropriate to the event); dates of onset and resolution; severity; 
assessment of relatedness to investigational product and action taken.  Diagnoses or 
syndromes -rather than signs or symptoms -should be recorded.  The investigator may be 
asked to provide follow-up information, discharge summaries, and extracts from medical 
records or e CRFs.  
If applicable, the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational product will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_7859]:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?”  The investigator should respond 
to this question with either Yes or No. 
The severity grading scale used in this study is described in  Appendix  B. 
Medicall y significant adverse events considered related to the investigational product by 
[CONTACT_883473].  
It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse 
event is related and of sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment 
or from the study.  A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what 
he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event.  If either of these situations arises, the subject should be strongly encouraged to undergo an end-of-study assessment and be under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.

Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1236023] from the European Medicines Agency that 
included approximately 507 subjects and a median follow up time of 20.8 months.  
Additional  interim analyses may be conducted to monitor the ongoing safety of 
denosumab or to make decisions regarding the use of denosumab in the treatment of 
giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB). 
10.6 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.6.1 General Approach/Considerations 
The statistical analysis in this open-label study will be descriptive in nature and no 
hypothesis testing will be performed.  All the efficacy  analyses will be conducted 
separately in each cohort and for cohorts 1 and 2 combined unless specified otherwise; 
and the safety analyses will be conducted for all cohorts combined.  The analyses  will be 
repeated for the adolescent population as  applicable.  Categorical data will be presented 
in the form of number and percentage.  Continuous data will be provided with the 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, 25
th percentile, 
75th percentile, minimum, and maximum).  The primary analysis will be conducted after 
all subjects have an opportunity to complete [ADDRESS_1236024] on this study, or  any worsening of adverse events initially experienced before 
initiation of this study.  This summary for adverse events will be performed for the following categories:  
•All adverse events
•Investigational product (IP)  related adverse events

Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  15 September 2015  Page 44 of 69 
CONFIDENTIAL    • CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events  
• IP related CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events  
• Serious adverse events  
• IP related serious adverse events  
• Adverse events leading to study discontinuation 
• IP related adverse events leading to study discontinuation 
• Adverse events leading to investigational product discontinuation 
• Fatal events  
Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Summary statistics for serum concentrations of denosumab will be provided for each 
timepoint (scheduled visit).  Summary statistics for the bone turnover markers, uNTx/Cr 
and sCTx, and their changes from baseline (absolute and % change) will be provided at 
scheduled visits. The analysis will be based on adolescent and adult subjects enrolled in the PK substudy receiving at least one dose of denosumab.   
Laboratory Parameters  
The analysis will be based on the combined sets of subjects receiving at least one dose 
of denosumab.  Summary statistics for lab values and their changes from baseline will 
be provided at scheduled visits.  Laboratory shift tables summarizing the worst changes 
in Common Terminology Criteria for adverse event (v3.0 or higher) grades between baseline and any study visits during the treatment period will be provided. 
Time to D isease Progression, T ime to D isease Recurrence, Progression F ree 
Survival, and T ime to Surgery 
Kaplan-Meier estimates will be graphically displayed.  K aplan-Meier event rates at 
various time points  (eg, month 3, month 6, etc ) with 2-sided confidence interval s will be 
summarized.  In addition, Kaplan-Meier estimates of quartiles (median, 25th and 
75
th percentiles) with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated if applicable.  
Time to disease progression, time to disease recurrence, and p rogression free survival 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_883475] [ADDRESS_1236025] -baseline,

Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1236026]’s eCRF . 
11.[ADDRESS_1236027]’s investigational product 
compliance (eg, amount administered) will be recorded on the subject’s eCRF .     
12. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
12.1 Informed Consent 
An initial generic informed consent and a Pediatric Assent Informed Consent form has 
been provided to the investigator for prepar ation of the informed consent document to be 
used at his or her site.  Updates to the template will be communicated by [CONTACT_883476].  The written informed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from the subject / subject’s parent or legally 
acceptable representative after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific screening 
procedures (with the exception of procedures performed as standard of care) or any 
investigational product is administered.   
A legally acceptable representative is an individual or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective subject, to the subject’s participation in the clinical study.   
If applicable, the investigator is also responsible for asking the subject / subject’s par ent 
or legally acceptable representative if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care 
physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical study  and recording the 
subject’s preference in the medical chart.  If the subject / subject’s parent  or legally 
acceptable representative agrees to such notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s primary care physician of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the 
subject does not agree to such notification, the investigator shall not inform the subject’s primary care physician.  
The acquisition of informed consent if applicable, the subject’s / subject parent’s  or 
legally acceptable representative agreement or refusal of his/her notification of the primary care physician, should be documented in the subject’s medical records, and the 
Product:  Denosumab (AMG 162)  
Protocol Number:  20062004  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1236028] and by [CONTACT_28506] (not necessarily an investigator).  The original signed informed consent form should be retained in 
accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form should be 
provided to the subject / subject parent’s  or legally acceptable representative. 
If a potential subject is illiterate or  visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the 
subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood.  
In this study, obtaining assent from the adolescent and consent from the parents or 
legally  authorized representative, as defined by [CONTACT_1769] , will apply.  An adolescent is 
defined as a person who has not attained the legal age for consent for  treatments or 
procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction 
in which the clinical investigation will take place.  The local  IEC/IRB  will determine the 
process for obtaining and documenting the assent process for pediatric  subjects, but 
should follow the guidelines established by [CONTACT_9930] (DHHS) Office of Human Research Protections guidelines, which state an 
explanation of the procedures involved in the study should be made in a language 
appropriate to the adolescent’s age, experience, maturity and condition.  
12.2 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board 
A copy of the protocol, proposed informed consent form, Pediatric Assent form (if 
appropriate), other written subject information, and any proposed advertising material 
must be submitted to the IEC/IRB for written approval.  A copy of the written approval of 
the protocol and informed consent form must be received by [CONTACT_883477].  
The investigator must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IEC/IRB 
for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent and 
Pediatric Assent form (if appropriate) documents.  The investigator should notify the IEC/IRB of deviations from the protocol or serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010] Global Safety, in accordance with 
local procedures.

the new responsible person and/or the new locati on. 
13.[ADDRESS_1236032] confidentiality is respected.  
The [COMPANY_010] monitor is responsible for verifying the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The 
monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study -related records 
needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs . 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing eCRFs , 
are resolved.

All data capture for this study is planned to be electronic, however if necessary data 
capture may be performed utilizing paper CRFs: 
• Corrections to paper forms will be made by a single line stroke through the error and 
insertion of the correction above or beside the error.  The change must be initialed 
and dated by [CONTACT_1720] a member of the study staff authorized by [CONTACT_883479].  No erasures, correction 
fluid, or tape may be used.   
• Correcti ons to electronic forms will be automatically documented through the 
software’s “audit trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review will be performed on subject data received at [COMPANY_010].  Dur ing 
this review, subject data will be checked for consistency, omissions, and any 
apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence to the protocol and GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data 
management review process, data queries and/or site notifications will be raised in 
the EDC system for site completion.  
• EDC only:  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_883447].  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_883448].  These signatures will indicate that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_883449] e CRFs, the data queries, and the site notifications, and 
agrees with the content.  P aper output of the e CRF is available should the 
Investigator or the IEC/IRB require hard copy output for review, signature, and 
storage at the study site.  
• [COMPANY_010]’s clinical data management department or designees will correct the database for the following e CRF issues without notification to site staff:  
− misspellings that do not change the meaning of the word (excluding adverse 
events and medications)  
− location of data recorded on an incorrect eCRF  (eg, moving lab data from 
general comments to the appropriate lab table)  
− date errors that occur into the new year  
− standard time to 24-hour clock  
− temperature unit errors (Fahrenheit vs Centigrade)  
− weight unit errors (pounds vs kilograms) if a baseline weight has been established  
− height unit errors (in. vs cm) 
− administrative data (eg, event names for unscheduled visits or retests)  
− clarifying “other, specify” if data are provided (eg, race, physical exam)  
− if both the end date and a status of continuing is indicated (eg, for adverse events, concomitant medication, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), the end date will supersede 
− deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same date but different clinical planned events —week 4 and early termination)

13.5 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, [COMPANY_010] encourages the formation of a publication committee consisting of several principal investigators and appropriate 
[COMPANY_010] staff.  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other 
investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff as appropriate.  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff) does not guarantee authorship-the criteria described below should be met for every publication. 
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 2005), which states: 
•Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the
version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.
•When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.
•Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research
group, alone, does not justify authorship.
•All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who
qualify should be listed.
•Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take publicresponsibility for appropriate portions of the content.

CONFIDENTIAL    1. Subjects will continue to receive denosumab  until complete tumor resection (if applicable), disease progression physician’s or subject’s decision, or [COMPANY_010]’s 
decision to discontinue for any reason, or administration of any of the proscribed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_883450]:  
6.5.  Denosumab 120 mg is given by [CONTACT_883481] a 
1.7 mL injection of denosumab 70 mg/mL.  
2.  Safety Follow -Up:  For all subjects, including the PK substudy, data (treatment plus follow -up) will be collected until the end of the clinical study ( Section 3.4.2) 
which is when subjects enrolled before Amendment [ADDRESS_1236040] discontinued.  For subjects who 
discontinue(d) investigational product , safety follow -up visits will be conducted approximately every 6 months ( ± 1 month) after the End of Treatment visit 
(approximately [ADDRESS_1236041]) for the first year, then every 12 months ( ± 1 month).   The final safety follow -up visit will be 
conducted at the time of the end of the clinical study (Section 3.4.2) (even if this in not approximately 6 or 12 months since the previous  follow -up visit).  Prior to 
Amendment 7, for subjects who were in the safety follow -up of  study [ADDRESS_1236042] be conducted in the clinic.  Thereafter, subjects may be contact[CONTACT_883468] (eg telephone) to complete the assessments.  
3.  Histopathology reports confirming the diagnosis of GCT of bone and demonstrating active disease are to be obtained to determine eligibility at screening (not 
required for 20040215 subjects) .  All on -study reports are to be attached to the subject’s medical record  if performed as standard of care except at end of study 
where this may be requested.  
4.  Histopathology samples may be requested during or  at end of study.  
5.  Imaging report will be required at screening to confirm eligibility  (not required for 20040215 subjects) .  All on -study imaging reports  must be attached to the 
subject’s medical  record  if performed as standard of care.  Select historical and select on-study imaging performed as standard of care will be required to be 
sent to a central imaging vendor for evaluation of disease response.  
6.  Serum chemistries performed by [CONTACT_883482], calcium, albumin, magnesium and phosphorus.  
7.  Physical exam: The screening PE includes medical history, Karnofsky performance status, disease status, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, weight and height. (After the subject has signed the informed consent and the medical history is recorded on the Medical and Surgical History eCRF, any new or 
worsening conditions should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF, including any reported during the screening period.) Thereafter, only a disease status and 
Karnofsky performance status will be collected during the treatment phase of the study and at [ADDRESS_1236043] for women of childbearing potential is to be conducted at screening, on study (approximately every 12 weeks while receiving denosumab treatment) and during safety follow up (only at 6 months after EoT).  A urine/serum  pregnancy test must be done at baseline prior to first dose of denosumab if 
study day 1 is greater than 7 days from the pregnancy confirmation done at screening.  
9. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO): Consist of BPI -SF. The BPI -SF will be administere d prior to each administration of investigational product at baseline, study 
days 8 and 15, then every 4 weeks (Q4W) from weeks 5 – 25, then every 12 weeks (Q12W) to end of study.  
10. Serum for anti - denosumab antibod y assay  will be collected at baseline and as outlined on the schedule of assessments, including 2 samples during follow up 
(approximately 6 and 12 months after the end of study visit) .  Prior to Amendment 7, for subjects who were in the safety follow -up of study [ADDRESS_1236044]:  Denosumab (AMG 162)

12. Informed consent may be obtained more than 28 days before Day 1 week 1.  
13. Cohort 3 subjects will  enroll at their next Q4W visit (based on their 20040215 schedule).  Informed consent will be obtained prior to any protocol specific 
procedures; PROs will be collected at their next Q12W assessment visit.  
14. Prior to Amendment 7, for subjects who were in the safety follow -up of study 20040215 and are e nrolling in this study, serum chemistries, physical examination, 
disease status, Karnofsky performance status,and pregnancy testing are not required during the safety follow- up.  Upon the approval of Amendment 7, subjects 
that enrolled in 20062004 from the 20040215 study will also follow the 20062004 schedule, and complete the assessments as directed in Appendix  A. 
15. Pharmacokinetic Substudy – Approximately 10 adolescent and approximately 10 adult subjects will contribute to the PK substudy.  Samples for pharmacokinetic, 
uNTx, and sCTx analysis on Study Day 1 will be obtained prior to IP administration.  Subjects enrolled in the PK substudy will be followed (treatment plus 
follow -up) until all subjects enrolled before Amendment [ADDRESS_1236046]:  Denosumab (AMG 162)

Rationale: 
•Safety follow -up period information was updated and adverse events of interest
were listed to align the protocol language with post marketing data collection
requirements and to increase compliance with long-term follow -up data
requirements.
•Interim analysis 4 was removed as it is not a regulatory requirement and no study
report is expected from this interim analysis per regulatory requirements.
•Pharmacy guide is obsolete and has been replaced by [CONTACT_883484].
•Medical history  section was updated for clarification and to align with other
sections of the protocol.
•The dose escalation and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_883451] [ADDRESS_1236056] 21 days between doses.
•Calcium and Vitamin D information was updated to match Xgeva productinformation.
•The number of birth control methods and amount of washout time required
between the end of treatment and pregnancy or breastfeeding was updated to
align with the informed consent and current safety information.
•Pregnancy reporting was changed from the Pregnancy Surveillance Program to
[COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety  as per current [COMPANY_010] standard.
•Administration, typographical  and formatting changes were made t hroughout the
protocol.

Rationale:  
• Safety follow -up period information was updated and adverse events of interest 
were listed to align the protocol language with post marketing data collection 
requirements and to increase compliance with long- term follow -up data 
requirements.  
• Interim analysis 4 was removed as it is not a regulatory requirement and no study report is expected from this interim analysis per regulatory requirements.  
• Pharmacy guide is obsolete and has been replaced by [CONTACT_883484].  
• Medical history section was updated for clarification and to align with other 
sections of the protocol.  
• The dose escalation and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_883458] [ADDRESS_1236097] 21 days between doses. 
• Calcium and Vitamin D i nformation was updated to match Xgeva product 
information.  
• The number of birth control methods and amount of washout time required 
between the end of treatment and pregnancy or breastfeeding was updated to 
align with the informed consent  and current safety  information. 
• Pregnancy reporting was changed from the Pregnancy Surveillance Program to 
[COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety  as per current [COMPANY_010] standard.  
• Administration, typographical  and formatting changes were made throughout the 
protocol.

 Amendment 7:  Rationale and Summary of Amendment Changes  
An Open- label, Multi- center, Phase [ADDRESS_1236098] 2008- 001606 -16 
 15 May  2013 
Summary of Changes:   
The primary reason for the amendment is to include  pharmacokinetic analyses for an 
additional approximately 20 subjects, approximately 10 adolescents and 10 adults.  
Additionally, the end of the clinical trial is defined as  when subjects enrolled through 
November 2012 (before Amendment 7 ) complete a minimum of [ADDRESS_1236099] .  Safety follow -up visits are 
described.  
Additional changes include the following:  
• Added objectives, endpoints, sample collection, and analyses consistent with the 
pharmacokinetic subset  
• Clarified that subjects who rolled over from 20040215 will follow the 20062004 
schedule under Amendment 7  
• Clarified the End of Treatment visit and Safety Follow -up visits  
• Added oral examinations for all subjects, and provided additional guidance regarding IP dosing and oral/dental procedures  
• Clarified safety reporting timelines  
• Added updated pregnancy and lactation reporting section, with additional instructi ons 
regarding counseling women of childbearing potential on the risks of pregnancy while 
receiving denosumab and discussing methods to decrease the risk  
• Removed references to and sections pertaining to Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd and 
Japanese sites, as there are no Japanese sites in this trial.  
• Typographic and formatting errors, redundancies, and inconsistencies were 
corrected

Protocol Title: 
 An Open-label, Multi-center, Phase [ADDRESS_1236106] 2008-001606-16 
IND # BB-9838 
 
  
Amendment 1 Date: 12 December 2008 
 Rationale:
  
The primary reason for this amendment is to include skeleta lly mature ad olescent s (ie, 
adolescents who have closed epi[INVESTIGATOR_728044]) into this study.  There have been rare 
reported cases of GCT of bone in adolescents.  Giant Cell Tumor of bone usually occurs in skeletally mature adolescents after the epi[INVESTIGATOR_883459], and all adolescent subjects enrolled into this study will have radiological confirmation of skeletal 
maturity.  No further long bone growth is anticipated after epi[INVESTIGATOR_883460]. 
 There are few treatment options for adolescents with mature skeletons and GCT of bone.  Based on the seriousness of GCT and the limited treatment options, [COMPANY_010] believes that this protocol, which includes adolescents with mature skeletons and GCT 
of bone, presents greater than minimal risk, but also presents the prospect of direct 
benefit to the subject 
Additional changes include the following: 
• The sample size has been clarified to include approximately 100 subjects 
enrolled and the supporting sample size calculations  
• An eligibility criteria excluding wome
n of child-bearing potential who are evidently 
pregnant or breast feeding has been added 
• 
Extension of follow-up visit to up to 12 months from 6 months 
• Other minor changes and typographical errors have been corrected throughout

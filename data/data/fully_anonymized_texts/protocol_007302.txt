3/Protocol  CO39303 , Version 8 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 8: RATIONALE  
The intent of this amendment is to simplify the protocol  assessments after the final 
overall survival (OS)  analysis, which is the last efficacy analysis planned for the study.  
The primary goals of the amendment have been to reduce the number of study visits 
and limit assessments in support of efficacy analyses after the final OS analysis.  
With the Clinical Trials Regulation  (CTR)  entering into application on 31  January  2022 
and the retirement of the Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP) in European 
countries , the Sponsor has decided to consolidate the former C O39303  VHP and 
CO39303  non‑VHP protocol versions into one protocol with this protocol amendment.  
The countries which have been following the VHP protocol are Austria, Belgium, 
Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the Unit ed 
Kingdom.   All other countries have been following the non-VHP protocol.  
The VHP protocol is different from the non‑VHP protocol in its requirement for daily 
glucose self -monitoring at home.  Mandatory self -monitoring of glucose was 
implemented with Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_83809] -prandial 
home glucose monitoring for the entire duration of study treatment to monitor the risk of 
hyperglycemia . 
In addition, safety requirements for hyperglycemia Grade  1 are different between the 
two protocol versions .  Home glucose monitoring is already performed daily for patients 
from VHP  countries w hereas , for patients from non -VHP countries , home glucose 
monito ring should only be considered.  For hyperglycemia Grade  2 and above , home 
glucose monitoring is mandatory for all patients.   The differences between the 
two protocol versions are highlighted in Sections  4.5.7  and [IP_ADDRESS]  as well as  in 
Appendix  1.  Of note, the differential requirements regarding glucose monitoring were 
already described in previous VHP and non -VHP protocol versions , and there were 
no changes introduced related to this aspect as part of this amendment.  Therefore, 
the countries should c ontinue with country ‑specific requirements for home glucose 
monitoring without introducing any changes.  
Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below:  
 Personal identifiable information (i.e., name [CONTACT_77064] r) for the 
Medical  Monitors has been removed from the protocol (front matter and 
Section  5.4.1).  Medical Monitor contact [CONTACT_76943] a 
sentence indicating that this information will be provided separately to sites.  
 The synopsis has been simplified to align with CTR , TransCelerate , and the Clinical 
electronic Structured Harmonised Protocol (CeSHarP) M11 s. 
 Update s to indicate that after the final OS analysis, study visits will be performed 
every 3  months instead of monthly for patients  who are still on ipatasertib treatment.   
Only safety data will be collected at study visits.  Tumor assessments will continue 
to be performed as per local practice and at the investigator ’s discretion , but these 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
4/Protocol  CO39303 , Version [ADDRESS_83810] already discontinued from study 
treatment and patients who are in the placebo arm and are receiving abiraterone 
only will no longer be followed after the final OS analysis , and no data will be 
collected from these patients  (Sections  3.1, 4.5.6 , and Appendix 1 ). 
 Update s to indicate that, after the final OS analysis, the following assessments are 
no longer required  were made ( Sections  3.1, 4.5.6, 4.5.7, 4.5.10, 4.5.11, 
Appendix  1, and Appendix  2): 
– All patient -reported outcome (PRO) assessments  
– Consumption of analgesics  information  (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438])  
– Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status  
– Symptomatic skeletal event  
– Optional blood for RBR (for DNA extraction)  
– Plasma samples for somatic tumor mutations and explora tory biomarkers 
analysis  
– Subsequent line of prostate cancer therapy and outcome  
– Disease Follow up and Post -Treatment Follow up visits for patients who have 
discontinued from study treatment  
– Study visits for patients who are in the placebo arm and are still  receiving 
abiraterone after the final OS analysis  
– Serum testosterone and PSA  samples for the central laboratory should no 
longer be collected since no additional analysis will be performed after this 
analysis  
 A section describing duration of participation  has been added to align with CTR 
requirements  (Section  3.2.1)  
 The responsibilities of the investigator and the role of the Medical  Monitor in 
determining patient eligibility and during study conduct have been clarified 
(Sections  4.1.1, [IP_ADDRESS], 4.4.2, 4.5 .7, Appendix 1) . 
 Clarified  that after the final OS analysis, investigators and patients will be unblinded 
about the treatment that the patient has been receiving in the study because 
efficacy analysis will be completed and blinding will no longer be requir ed 
(Section  4.2) 
 Clarified  that after the patients’ unblinding, the patients who are on placebo and 
abiraterone  will continue receiving abiraterone only.  These  patients will no longer 
be required to attend study visits.  The only patients that will contin ue to be followed  
via regular 3 -mothly study visits are those that are receiving ipatasertib  
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
 Update to indicate that after the patients’ unblinding , home glucose monitoring will 
be performed in countries with mandatory self ‑monitoring of glucose only for 
patients  who are receiving ipatasertib  (Section  4.5.7 , Appendix 1) 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
5/Protocol  CO39303 , Version 8  Clarified that the post -trial access to ipatasertib may be provided through the 
extension study or post-trial access program  for patients who are still receiving 
ipataserti b after the final OS analysis  (Section  4.3.5 ). 
 The email address for withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository after site 
closure has been corrected  (Section  4.5.12).  
 Update to reflect guidelines provided to VHP and non ‑VHP countries regarding  
home -glucose monitoring in case of hyperglycemia  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 A description of the technical and organizational security measures taken to protect 
personal data has been added to align with CTR requirements (Section  8.4). 
 Due to certain local requirement s and an alignment of Sponsor process, it has been 
clarified that summaries of clinical study results may be available in health authority 
databases for public access in addition to redacted Clinical Study Reports 
(Section  9.6). 
 A comprehensive list of inv estigational medicinal products and auxiliary medicinal 
products (non-investigational medicinal product) has been added to align with 
CTR requirements (Section  4.3 and Appendix  14). 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics .  This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

22/Protocol CO39303 , Version [ADDRESS_83826] commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the second leading 
cause of death in men in the Western world (Ferlay et al. 2015).  Although most men are 
diagnosed with localized disease, progression to metastatic disease to the bones and 
visceral  organs leads to significant morbidity and mortality (Logothetis  et al. 2012; 
Basch  et al. 2014).  In the [LOCATION_002], prostate cancer is the most common non -skin 
cancer diagnosed, with over 180,890  new cases and 26,120  deaths 
(American  Cancer  Society 2016).  Likewise, in Europe, prostate cancer leads male 
cancer diagnoses with approximately 417,000  new cases and 92,000  deaths 
(Ferlay  et al. 2013).  
Treatment of localized prostate cancer often incorporates multimodality therapy and can 
be associated with  significant functional sequelae.  Multimodality treatment includes 
surgery and/or radiation with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  For  men 
with metastatic disease, primary treatment for prostate cancer is ADT; however, 
most  patients will pro gress despi[INVESTIGATOR_76908] 
( 50 ng/dL) either through surgical or medical castration.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_76909] -extending therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76910] -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), 
the maj ority of men will die of their disease as the median life expectancy in this 
population is less than 3 years (Ryan et al. 2013;  Beer et al. 2014).  
The phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI3K) -AKT pathway is one of the most frequently 
activated pathways in prostate  cancer, with genomic alterations occurring in 
approximately 50% of cases with genetic loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog  
(PTEN)  as the most common cause (Robinson et al. 2015).  Deregulation of this 
pathway results in activation of downstream targets (e.g., PRAS40, mammalian target of 
rapamycin  [mTOR], [COMPANY_004]3b, FOXO, etc.) involved in survival, proliferation, cell ‑cycle 
progression, growth, migration, and angiogenesis (Yuan  and Cantley  2008).  
Prostate‑specific deletion of  PTEN  in mouse models mimics fea tures of human prostate 
cancer, and AKT1 deletion in a conditional PTEN  knockout model significantly reduces 
prostate cancers (Chen et al. 2006 ; Guertin et al. 2009 ; Nardella et al. 2009).  
Additionally, PTEN  deletion promotes androgen independence in cell  lines and mouse 
models of prostate cancer (Gao et al. 2006 ; Jiao et al. 2007).  Activation of the 
PI3K‑AKT pathway is physiologically relevant as it compensates for androgen receptor 
(AR) downregulation and provides a means for receptor blockade escape; i n a similarly 
reciprocal manner, blockade of the PI3K -AKT pathway leads to increased stability and 
activity of the androgen receptor, demonstrating the cooperative action of both pathways 
to enable prostate cancer progression (Carver et al. 2011 ; Mulhollan d et al. 2011).  
Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that low PTEN expression and PTEN 
loss (further described as PTEN loss) is associated with worse prognosis

23/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 (Yoshimoto  et al. 2007 ; Reid et al. 2010 ; Antonarakis et al. 2012 ; Chaux et al. 2012 ; 
Zafarana  et al. 2012 ; Cuzick et al. 2013 ; Barnett et al. 2014 ; Ferraldeschi  et al. 2015 ; 
Kim et al. 2015), regardless of whether patients are newly diagnosed, receiving 
treatment for localized disease, or have late -line advanced 
metastatic  castration resistant disease.  Collectively, these results suggest that 
activation of the PI3K -AKT pathway is an important driver for prostate cancer and that 
the pathway is a relevant target for treatment.  
1.2 BACKGROUND ON IPATAS ERTIB   
Ipatasertib is a potent, highly selective, small -molecule inhibitor of all three  isoforms of 
the serine/threonine kinase AKT and showed potent activity in nonclinical models, 
including prostate cancer, and in models both in vitro and in vivo with PTEN  loss.  
In nonclinical prostate cance r models unselected for PTEN loss, the combination of 
ipatasertib with hormonal therapy (abiraterone acetate [hereafter referred to as 
abiraterone] or enzalutamide) resulted in more substantial tumor growth inhibition versus 
either agent alone.  In the Pha se Ib/II study  GO27983 in the post -docetaxel setting, 
ipatasertib (400 -mg dose) when added to abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone 
showed improved radiographic progression -free survival (rPFS) benefit compared with 
abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolon e in the all -comer population and, in particular, 
in patients with PTEN -loss tumors (see Section  1.3). 
Refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and 
clinical  studies.  
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT−RISK ASSESSM ENT 
The activity of anti -hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76911] -resistant setting has 
resulted in improved survival for patients with prostate  cancer.  Abiraterone  acetate  
(Zytiga®), a pro -drug for abiraterone, is  an androgen  biosynthesis inhibitor that blocks the 
enzyme CYP17, which is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues.  
The efficacy and safety of abiraterone  were initially demonstrated in patients with 
mCRPC who had  received prior docetaxel and were assessed in a Phase  III, 
randomized, placebo -controlled,  multicenter, clinical trial (de Bono et al. 2011).  A  total of 
1195  patients  were  randomized  2:1 to recei ve either abiraterone orally at a dose of 
1000  mg once daily (QD) in combination with  prednisone/prednisolone orally at a dose 
of 5 mg twice daily (BID; n   797) or  placebo QD plus prednisone/prednisolone at the 
same dose of 5  mg BID (n   398).  This Phase  III study demonstrated  that abiraterone is 
well tolerated and prolongs overall survival (OS) relative  to placebo in  patients with 
mCRPC previously treated with taxanes.  These results indicate that AR  signaling 
continues to play a  critical role in the set ting of castration ‑resistant disease.  Additional 
clinical benefit for abiraterone was demonstrated in the pre -docetaxel setting 
(Ryan  et al. 2013 ).  Although treatment with  abiraterone can significantly delay 
progression of disease and improve OS, there i s nearly universal development of 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
24/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 therapeutic resistance and  disease progression.   Refer to the Zytiga® prescribing 
information ( Zytiga PI ) for additional details.  
Recent nonclinical data suggest that reciprocal crosstalk between the AR and  
PI3K/AKT  pathwa ys occurs in PTEN -loss mCRPC.  Specifically, activation of  the 
PI3K/AKT  pathway is associated with repressed androgen signaling, and inhibition of the 
PI3K/AKT  pathway restores AR signaling in PTEN -deficient  prostate cells.  Proposed 
mechanisms to  account for these observations include  PI3K/AKT inhibition resulting in 
feedback activation of AR via upregulation of human epi[INVESTIGATOR_76912], relieving feedback inhibition of AKT by [CONTACT_76944] -rich repeat -protein phosphatase (Carver  et al. 2011).  
This reciprocal cooperativity between PI3K/AKT and AR  pathways suggests inhibition of 
only one  pathway would lead to suboptimal clinical efficacy.  Therefore, combined 
inhibition of the AR and PI3K/AK T pathways may result in measurable decline of 
tumor  cell viability and more durable clinical benefit.  Given the strong implication of  
PI3K/AKT  activity in prostate cancer cell survival  and therapeutic resistance, ipatasertib 
could be particularly  effecti ve given in combination with abiraterone in 
PTEN‑loss mCRPC dependent o n the PI3K/AKT pathway for growth and survival.  
A Phase  Ib/II clinical trial (Study  GO27983; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was conducted to evaluate 
ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone and predn isone/prednisolone in patients with 
mCRPC (de Bono et al. 2016a, 2018).  The Phase  Ib portion of the study was 
open  label, using dose escalation to determine the recommended Phase  II dose of 
ipatasertib.  In  the Phase  II portion of the trial, patients with  mCRPC previously treated 
with docetaxel -based therapy were randomized to three arms (in a 1:1:1 ratio) in a 
double‑blind fashion:  ipatasertib 400 mg, ipatasertib 200 mg, or placebo.  Each  arm was 
in combination with abiraterone (1000 mg) and prednisone/p rednisolone (5  mg 
twice  daily [BID]).  Patients were stratified according to previous enzalutamide treatment 
(yes or  no), number of chemotherapeutic regimens (1 or  1), and progression 
(prostate ‑specific antigen [PSA] only or other).  The co -primary efficacy endpoints were 
rPFS in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population (i.e., with unselected tumors), as well as in 
patients with PTEN -loss tumors.  Secondary endpoints included safety, OS, time to PSA 
progression, and PSA response rate.  
The primary efficac y endpoint, as measured by [CONTACT_76945]/prednisolone, indicated a larger improvement at 400  mg 
versus placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR]   0.75; 90% CI: 0.56  to 1.04; p   0.17) relative 
to ipatasertib 200  mg v ersus placebo (stratified HR   0.94; 90% CI: 0.69  to 1.28; 
p  0.75).  A trend for improved OS was observed in the ipatasertib 400 ‑mg arm versus 
the placebo arm (median, 18.9 vs. 15.6 months, respectively; stratified HR   0.72; 
p  0.22), which was overall  improved as assessed by [CONTACT_76946] 
200‑mg vs. placebo arm (median, 21.5 vs. 15.6 months, respectively; 
stratified  HR   0.96; p  = 0.87).  Additionally, time to PSA progression was prolonged in 
the ipatasertib 400 ‑mg plus abiraterone and prednisone arm compared with the placebo 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
25/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 plus abiraterone and prednisone arm (median, 5.6 vs. 3.7 months, respectively; 
stratified  HR   0.70; p   0.07) and relative to the ipatasertib 200 ‑mg plus abiraterone and 
prednisone arm (medi an, 3.8  vs. 3.7 months, respectively; stratified HR   0.95; p   0.79).  
Overall, both ipatasertib treatment arms had numerically favorable results over the 
placebo, with the ipatasertib 400 -mg arm trending for improved OS.  
Ipatasertib dose levels of 400 mg  and 200 mg QD in combination with abiraterone and 
prednisone were generally well tolerated; the adverse events were manageable and 
reversible in patients with mCRPC.  Major adverse events attributable to ipatasertib 
include diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, vom iting, rash, and hyperglycemia.  The  most 
common adverse events ( 10%) associated with abiraterone are fatigue, joint swelling 
or discomfort, edema, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, hypertension, dyspnea, 
urinary tract infection, and confusion.  Alth ough data for the combination of ipatasertib 
and abiraterone indicate reasonable patient tolerability, there is some overlap in adverse 
event types.  Adverse events of special interest, in addition to overall safety, will be 
monitored as outlined in this p rotocol.  
In addition, as a component of the co -primary analysis, rPFS in patients with PTEN  loss 
was assessed.  PTEN expression was analyzed by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) via the 
Institute of Cancer Research assay (de Bono et al. 2016b).  PTEN  status was 
IHC evaluable in 165 cases, with PTEN loss reported in 71 cases (43%).  PTEN  loss 
was associated with a worse rPFS outcome in the placebo arm, but ipatasertib improved 
rPFS compared with placebo at both the [ADDRESS_83827] at 400  mg and in PTEN -loss cancers (de  Bono  et al. 2016b).  
Exploratory PTEN -loss assays included a Ventana  IHC assay, and genomic loss of 
PTEN was further explored by [CONTACT_26707] (FISH) and 
next-generation sequencing (NGS).  There was high concordance for PTEN  loss 
between FISH, NGS, and IHC.  This clinical data strongly support PTEN  loss as being a 
predictive response biomarker for mCRPC for agents targeting the PI3K -AKT pathway.  
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS  
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib plus 
abiraterone plus prednisone or prednisolone (hereafter referred to as “abiraterone”), 
compared with placebo plus abiraterone in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patie nts 
previously untreated for mCRPC.  Specific objectives and corresponding endpoints for 
the study are outlined below (see  Table  1).

computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Analysis will be based 
on the ITT and PTEN -loss populations, the latter defined using the Ventana  
PTEN  IHC assay.  Patients must also have a valid PTEN  IHC result from tumor to be 
enrolled.  
All eligible patients will receive abiraterone 1000  mg administered orally  QD, 
prednisone/prednisolone 5  mg or ally BID, and either ipatasertib at a dose of 400  mg 
(experimental arm) or placebo administered orally QD (control arm).  Study  treatment 
will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, elective withdrawal from the 
study, or study completion  or termination.  
Tumor measurement for disease evaluation will be performed with bone scans and 
CT/MRI per schedule in  Appendix  1, and respon se will be evaluated per Prostate 
Cancer Working Group  3 (PCWG3) guidelines.  For  patients who have evidence of 
progression by [CONTACT_76948], a confirmatory scan must be performed.  For  patients 
with soft tissue progression, a confirmatory scan is not ne eded.  Patients with 
progression by [CONTACT_76949].   Images for tumor assessments will be collec ted for 
independent data review to enable blinded, independent central review as needed.  
Cross over will not be allowed.  
The study will enroll approximately 1100 patients at approximately 200  centers 
worldwide in about 20 months.  The study schema is shown in Figure  1.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
30/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 and the China extension cohort.  The Chinese patients enrolled in the 
China  extension  cohor t will undergo the same schedule of assessments and will receive 
study treatment as in the global (main study) cohort.  
The China subgroup may include all Chinese patients enrolled in the global (main study) 
cohort and the China extension cohort.  The China  subgroup analysis will be performed 
as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and summarized in a separate clinical 
study report.  The Chinese patients enrolled in the global (main study) will be analyzed 
together with all other patients enrolle d in the main study and reported in the main study 
clinical study report.  
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1  ratio to one of the 
two following treatment arms (each consisting of 28 -day cycles of oral administration):  
 Arm 1:  abiraterone (1000  mg QD) plus prednisone/prednisolone (5  mg BID) plus 
ipatasertib (400  mg QD)  
 Arm 2:  abiraterone (1000  mg QD) plus prednisone/prednisolone (5  mg BID) plus 
placebo (matched to ipatasertib appearance)  
 
A randomization scheme will be used across all study sites through a centralized 
interactive voice - or web-based response system (IxRS).  In this study, randomization of 
patients will be stratified on the basis of the following factors:  
 Prior taxane -based therapy in the hormone -sensitive setting (yes vs. no)  
 Progression factor (PSA only vs. other)  
 Presence of visceral metastasis (liver or lung) (yes vs. no)  
 Tumor PTEN -loss status by [CONTACT_76950] (yes vs. no)  
 Geographic region (not a factor for stratified anal ysis) 
 
Prior to enrollment, but after signing the Informed Consent Form, patients will have the 
PTEN -loss status of their tumor assessed by [CONTACT_76951] a validated 
IHC assay with defined criteria for PTEN loss.  Patients whose tumor samples have 
invalid PTEN  IHC test result will not be permitted to enroll in the study.  
Study assessments (efficacy, safety, patient -reported outcomes, and pharmacokinetic 
[PK] measurements) and timing of those assessments during each [ADDRESS_83829] or MRI, and bone scans will be 
evaluated locally by [CONTACT_473].  Res ponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 
Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1) will be used to assess CT or MRI scans of lesions in soft 
tissues.  Bone lesions will be assessed by [CONTACT_76952], using the PCWG3  criteria to 
assess disease progression.  All scans wil l be prospectively collected and centrally 
archived.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
31/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 Timely and complete disease assessments by [CONTACT_76953].  Each tumor assessment will be performed as scheduled according to the 
calendar, regardless of any study treatment  doses omitted, to prevent the introduction of 
bias into the assessment of efficacy.  Failure to perform any of the required disease 
assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that timepoint.  
In addition, an independent review  facility (IRF) may provide an assessment of 
radiographically assessed disease progression as an exploratory endpoint to support the 
findings of the investigator assessed outcomes.  Details are included in the SAP.  
The data will be collected from all pati ents.  
Patients will receive study treatment until radiographically assessed disease progression 
(as assessed by [CONTACT_76954]  v1.1 and/or PCWG3  criteria as applicable), 
intolerable toxicity, elective discontinuation of the study treatment, el ective withdrawal 
from the study, initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, study completion or termination by 
F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd (the Sponsor), or physician decision, whichever occurs first.  
For patients where disease progression is assessed only on t he basis of bone  scan 
findings, a confirmatory scan MUST be performed per PCWG3  criteria to establish 
disease progression.  Patients who discontinue one of the study treatments 
(i.e., ipatasertib/placebo or abiraterone) in the absence of radiographically a ssessed 
disease progression may continue the study and receive the remaining single ‑agent 
treatment (i.e., abiraterone if ipatasertib/placebo is discontinued or ipatasertib/placebo 
if abiraterone is discontinued) at the discretion of the investigator.  
Patients who discontinue from study treatment will return for a study treatment 
completion visit within [ADDRESS_83830] dose of study treatment.  
Crossover between treatment arms is not allowed.  
Following radiographically assessed disease progression (as  assessed by [CONTACT_76955]  v1.1 and/or PCWG3  criteria as applicable) and study treatment 
discontinuation, patients will continue post -treatment follow -up for selected assessments 
supporting secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, until death, loss to follow -up, 
withdrawal of consent from study, or study termination by [CONTACT_2728].  
Sites should record for all patients who are in follow -up, survival information including 
symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs), initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy 
(including the date of the first dose of agent, the date of the last dose of agent, patient’s 
best response, and date of disease progression), date of second radiographically 
assessed disease progression and any post -progression therapy for prostat e cancer , as 
well as any serious adverse events considered by [CONTACT_76956] (abiraterone and/or ipatasertib/placebo).  
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
32/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 Patients who discontinue from study treatment for reasons other than radiographically  
assessed disease  progression will be asked to return to the clinic for disease follow -up 
visits approximately every 3 months to complete tumor assessments until 
radiographically assessed disease progression (per RECIST  v1.1 and/or PCWG3  criteria  
as applicable) or withdraw al from study.  
All patients who discontinue from study treatment because of radiographically assessed 
disease progression or any other reasons will be asked to report at home or at the clinic, 
pain medications (including dose and type of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27251]), pai n severity (7 -day recall), 
and other patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures approximately every [ADDRESS_83831] -progression ther apy or after 1  year, patients will be asked to report 
pain severity, analgesic use (yes vs. no), EuroQol 5 Dimensions, 5  Levels (EQ ‑5D‑5L); 
and three scales from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnaire C ore 30 (EORTC  QLQ -C30) every 3  months completed at 
home or at the clinic or via telephone calls.  
After the final OS analysis, only patients who are still receiving ipatasertib will be 
required to attend study visits.  Adverse events and drug accountability  will be 
collected at 3 monthly study visits until the patient’s discontinuation from study 
treatment.  Tumor  assessments will no longer be required at the study visits but will be 
conducted as per local practice and at the Investigator discretion.  Tumor assessment 
data will no longer be collected after the final OS analysis (please see Appendix  1).  
For all patients who have discontinu ed study treatment, only reportable serious adverse 
events will be collected after the final OS analysis.  
An independent Data Coordinating Center (iDCC) will prepare all summaries and 
analyses for the independent Data Monitoring Committee’s (iDMC’s) review .  The  safety 
summaries will include but will not be limited to demographic data, adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and relevant laboratory data (see iDMC  charter for details).  
Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor and will follow a cha rter that 
outlines their roles and responsibilities.  Following the data review, the iDMC will provide 
a recommendation to the Sponsor whether to continue the study, amend the protocol, or 
stop the study.  The final decision will rest with the Sponsor.  
Any outcomes of the iDMC’s reviews on the safety and benefit risk balance that affect 
study conduct will be communicated in a timely manner to the investigators for 
notification of Institutional Review Boards and Ethics Committees (IRBs/ECs).

3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
3.3.1  Dose Rationale for the Combination  
In the aforementioned Phase  Ib/II study, ipatasertib was administered at doses of 
200 mg and 400  mg QD, continuously in 28 -day treatment cycles.  Abiraterone was 
administered at a dose of 1000  mg QD alongside prednisone at a dose of 5  mg BID, 
continuously in 28 -day treatment cycles.  The combination was wel l tolerated.  
Based  upon the spectrum and frequency of adverse events attributable to the ipatasertib 
and abiraterone/prednisone combination, in addition to the trend of favorable efficacy, 
the recommended dose was determined to be 400 mg ipatasertib given continuously in 
28‑day treatment cycles, in combination with the standard dose for abiraterone.  
Complete information for ipatasertib is found in the Investigator’s Brochure, as the 
single  reference safety document.  The single refe rence safety document for abiraterone 
is the most recent version of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).  
3.3.2  Rationale for Patient Population  
The Phase  II study (GO27983) evaluated ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone and 
prednisone in the pos t-docetaxel mCRPC setting.  This study will give the same 
combination in a n mCRPC patient population that has not received docetaxel treatment 
in this setting (i.e., patients may have received docetaxel or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76913] -sensitive setting).   Specifically, this study will investigate the efficacy and 
safety of ipatasertib as an add -on therapy to abiraterone and prednisone (standard of 
care) in previously untreated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with mCRPC.  
Although there are cur rently no data with this combination in previously untreated 
patients with mCRPC, the expectation is that the mechanism of action for ipatasertib is 
relevant in the pre - and post -docetaxel settings because PI3K -AKT pathway alterations 
are frequent in prost ate cancer and are not limited to specific disease stage(s) as 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
34/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 discussed above.  For patients with untreated mCRPC, options for therapy include either 
hormonal ‑based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76914].  Current  recommendations 
support the use of cytotoxic  therapy for symptomatic disease, and therefore the defined 
study  population will include only those patients with asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic disease at enrollment.  As described in Section  1.3, there was a greater 
rPFS  improvement with the addition of ipatasertib to abiraterone in patients with 
PTEN‑loss cancers versus those without evidence of PTEN loss using both 
protein‑based and DNA -based assays.  As such, Study  CO39303 was designed to test 
for a significant improvement of rPFS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors as a co ‑primary 
endpoint alongside testing rPFS in the all -comer population (see Section  6.4.1 ). 
3.3.[ADDRESS_83834] ‑docetaxel 
mCRPC settings.  Thus, the treatment benefit seen with ipatasertib in combination with 
abiraterone and prednisone in the post -docetaxel setting is likely to be observed in the 
pre‑docetaxel setting ( Section  1.3). 
During this study, abiraterone administration will be as described in the most recent 
version of the local prescribing information.  
3.3.4  Rationale for Double -Blind Design  
This is a double -blind study.  The use of abiraterone plus placebo control is to allow for 
discrimination between patient outcomes (changes in symptoms, signs, and other 
morbidity) caused by [CONTACT_76957] p atient expectations (via PROs).  
3.3.[ADDRESS_83835] 
1 patient is enrolled in China during the global enrollment phase, additional patients in 
China will be enrol led into a subsequent China extension phase, as needed, to enroll a 
total of approximately 200  patients in the China subpopulation.  Thus, 
the China  subpopulation will include patients enrolled at sites in China during both the 
global enrollment phase and the China extension phase , if it is necessary.  
3.3.6  Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Sampling and Schedule  
A sparse sampling strategy will be applied in this study (see Appendix  2 for schedule).  
The sampling schedule is designed to enable characterization of ipatasertib PK following 
first dose and at steady -state using population PK (popPK) methodology.  Individual 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
35/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 PK parameters estimated from the sparse sampling scheme will be used for exploratory 
exposureresponse analyses.  
3.3.7  Rationale for Patient -Reported Outcomes Assessments  
In this study, examining and measuring the patient ’s experience of symptoms and their 
interference with daily life will be a ccomplished using patient -completed rating scales.  
Symptomatic bone metastases are associated with high pain severity, which interferes 
with patients’ ability to function.  
Because these concepts cannot be observed , they are therefore best documented 
throu gh standardized PROs.  PRO assessments provide the means to validly and 
reliably quantify subjective information, which can only by [CONTACT_76958].  
Instruments implemented in t he study —namely, a pain severity Numeric Rating Scale 
(NRS), the EORTC  QLQ‑C30, and the urinary scale from the Prostate Cancer Module 
(EORTC  QLQ -PR-25), the EQ -5D-5L in its entirety (including the visual analog scale 
[VAS]) and selected items from the Nati onal Cancer Institute (NCI) -developed 
Patient‑Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (PRO ‑CTCAE) item bank —have been selected on the basis of their content 
validity and performance and to minimize patients’ completi on burden.  
A patient -completed log will be used to document the consumption of analgesic 
medications (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]) to treat pain related to prostate cancer.  The term “opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]” 
in the context of this study encompasses both natural and synthetic substances that act 
on the main opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328].  
Changes in symptom severity and interference with daily life will be documented at 
specified time points throughout the study.  Data will be collected via a patient 
provisioned electronic device, including reminding alerts in order to maximize 
compliance.  Back -up paper forms will be available if needed in order to capture 
patient  data.  It is critical to rigorously collect the PRO data as they support secondary 
endpoints.  
PRO data collected after initiation  of post -progression therapy until death will be used as 
a unique opportunity to quantify patients’ post -treatment experience in terms of 
humanistic outcomes.  
In addition, the EQ -5D-5L will be completed to inform pharmacoeconomic models.  
3.3.8  Tissue and Blood -Based Biomarker Assessments  
A key objective of the study biomarker analysis is to investigate candidate  biomarkers 
assessed in tumor tissue and blood, obtained prior to treatment, for their potential 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
36/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 predictive value in identifying patients who may benefit from treatment with abiraterone 
and prednisone in combination with ipatasertib.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PTEN Expression Analysis by [CONTACT_76959] -primary endpoint of rPFS in patients with tumor PTEN  loss in 
Study  GO27983 demonstrated that these patients derived greater r PFS benefit relative 
to those without PTEN  loss using multiple protein - and DNA -based methods.  
The Ventana PTEN  IHC assay is a validated assay that will be performed at a central 
laboratory and will be used to prospectively describe the PTEN  status of baseline tumor 
sample, as described in the laboratory manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RNA and DNA Sequencing Analysis  
NGS techniques such as targeted exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing 
(WGS) may offer a unique opportunity to identify biomarkers of response and/or de  novo 
mechanisms of resistance to the study treatments.  In addition to the mutational 
activation of proteins detected by [CONTACT_76960], NGS  methodologies can detect 
changes in RNA and DNA that can also activate the PI3K and AR pathways.  Therefore, 
the NGS a nalysis of DNA and RNA from the patient specimens (e.g.,  tumor tissue and/or 
plasma -derived nucleic acids) allows further in -depth molecular characterization of the 
patient samples to help develop an integrative genomic landscape of patients with 
castrate‑resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plasma Sample for Somatic Tumor Mutation Analysis  
There is increasing evidence that circulating -tumor DNA obtained from blood specimens 
of cancer patients is representative of the DNA and mutational status of tumor cells 
(Diehl  et al. 2008 ; Maheswaran et al. 2008 ).  Assays are available that can detect the 
major AR  mutations and copy number (CN; and other cancer ‑related genes) in plasma, 
and results from these analyses may be correlated with the mutation result in tumor 
specimens ( Romanel et al. 2015 ).  The use of circulating tumor DNA to monitor 
response to treatment is an area of great interest.  It could allow for an early, 
non-invasive, and quantifiable method for use in the clinical setting to identify candidates 
for sp ecific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76915] 
(Higgins  et al. 2012 ).  In addition, sensitive methods for the purification and quantitation 
of RNA  expression levels and specific RNA variants (e.g.,  AR‑V7) have enabled the 
analysis of RNA extracted from cancer cell vesicles released in blood 
(Del Re et al. 2016) and enables the opportunity to explore RNA ‑based methodologies 
to identify possible predictive or prognostic biomarkers in CRPC.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blood Sample for the Detection of Plasma Protein  Biomarkers  
Emerging evidence indicates that increases in levels of systemic  cytokines and 
chemokines, such as receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, can attenuate responses 
to drugs, particularly, targeted agents (Wilson et al. 2012 ).  Assays that assess the 
expression of soluble, systemic cytokines and chemokines from the plasma of patients 
may be performed using ELISA -based mass spectrometry or appropriate methodologies.  
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
37/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 [IP_ADDRESS]  Blood Sample for Next -Generation Sequencing  
NGS technologies generate a large  quantity of sequencing data.  Tumor  DNA can 
contain both reported and unreported chromosomal alterations because of the 
tumorigenesis process.  To help control for sequencing calls in previously unreported 
genomic alterations, a blood sample for NGS contr ol will be taken during predose to 
determine whether an observed alteration identified in the tumor tissue is somatic 
throughout the evaluation of the DNA isolated in peripheral blood.

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLIND ING 
Patients will be allocated to one of two treatment arms through use of a permuted block 
randomization algorithm with predefined stratification variables:  prior taxane ‑based 
therapy in the hormone -sensitive prostate cancer setting (yes vs. no), progression 
disease factor (PSA vs. other), presence of visceral metastasis (liver or lung, y es vs. no), 
and tumor PTEN ‑loss status by [CONTACT_76966] (yes vs. no).  The stratification factor of 
geographic region will not be a factor used for the stratified analysis.  A  placebo for 
ipatasertib will be used in the control arm.  Patients, investigators, a nd the Sponsor will 
be blinded to treatment arm assignment  until the final OS analysis, at which time 
unblinding will be done by [CONTACT_1034], and patients and investigators will be informed 
about the treatment the patient has been receiving . 
If unblinding is necessary  before the final OS analysis  for patient management related to 
adverse events during study treatment (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse  event for 
which patient management might be affected by [CONTACT_76967]), the in vestigator will be able to break the treatment arm code by [CONTACT_76968]; approval from the Sponsor is not required in such circumstances.  Treatment 
arm codes should not be broken except in emergency situations.  If the investigator 
wishes to know t he identity of the study drug for any other reason, he or she should 
contact [CONTACT_66324].  In the event of unblinding prior to study completion, 
the investigator should document and provide an explanation for any premature 
unblinding (e.g. , accidental unblinding, unblinding on account of a serious adverse 
event).

dosing time),  the patient should resume dosing with the next  scheduled dose the 
following day.  Missed, omitted, or vomited doses will not be made up.  
For all clinic visits, the glucose level of the patient must be reviewed prior to furthe r 
ipatasertib/placebo administration and prior to discharge from the clinic.  
On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle  1 and on all other clinic visit days that require a predose  
blood draw for PK  sampling (see  Appendix  2) and/or laboratory assessments, patients 
will be instructed to take their morning  oral dose of study drug in the clinic after 
completion of the pretreatment  assessments outlined in  Appendix  1.  For all other days 
of Cycle  1 and other cycles, the daily dose of study  drug should be taken approximately 
the same time each day at home . 
Patients may temporarily suspend study treatment for up to 28  consecutive  days if they 
experience a toxicity that is considered related to study treatment and requires a 
dose  hold.  Patients who miss  28 consecutive days of scheduled treatment with 
ipatasertib/placebo or  28 consecutive days of abiraterone because of 
study  treatment related adverse events will discontinue the respective study treatment, 
except for patients with a favorable benefit risk assessment who may be allowed to re -
initiate treatment at the investigator’s discretion following consultation with the 
Medical Monitor.  Treatment interruptions for reasons other than toxicity (e.g.,  surgical 
procedures) may be allowed at the investigato r’s discretion following consultation with 
the Medical Monitor.  Patients who discontinue one of the study treatments 
(i.e., ipatasertib/placebo or abiraterone) in the absence of radiographically assessed 
disease progression may continue the remaining sing le‑agent treatment 
(i.e., abiraterone if ipatasertib/placebo is discontinued or ipatasertib/placebo if 
abiraterone is discontinued) until radiographically assessed disease progression.  
Patients whose treatment with ipatasertib/placebo is transiently held or discontinued for 
adverse effects should continue abiraterone, and vice versa.  The 
prednisone/prednisolone dose may be reduced or discontinued for safety in either 
treatment arm.  Equivalent doses of dexamethasone (e.g.,  0.5 mg BID) may be 
substituted f or prednisone/prednisolone.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
45/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 An increase in PSA, without evidence of radiographically assessed disease progression, 
should not be used as a criterion to discontinue study treatment and to start a new 
systemic anti ‑neoplastic therapy during the study.  
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are 
provided in  Section  5.1.  Complete information for ipatasertib is found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure as the single reference safety document.  The single reference 
safety document for abiraterone is the most  recent version of the SmPC.  
Any dose modification should be noted on the Study  Drug Administration electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of overdose, medication error, drug abuse, or drug 
misuse, along with any associated adverse events, should be re ported as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
4.3.3  Dosage Modifications  
Every effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and 
sched ule.  However, in the event of significant treatment -related toxicity, administration 
of study  drugs (ipatasertib/placebo or abiraterone or prednisone/prednisolone) may need 
to be adjusted as described below and in further detail in Section  5.1.  Depending on the 
nature of the toxicity observed, dosing adjustment(s) may be required for just one or 
both study drugs in the combination. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification 
should be based on the worst toxicity observed.  Patients are to be instructed to notify 
investigators at the first occurrence of any adverse sign or symptom.  
Dose modifications may occur in three ways:  
 Dosin g interruption  
 Dosing reduction(s)  
 Permanent discontinuation  
 
Patients discontinuing ipatasertib/placebo treatment because of 
treatment ‑related  toxicity may continue on the active treatment phase of the study 
receiving abiraterone monotherapy as per the investigator’s discretion.  Patients 
discontinuing abiraterone treatment because of treatment -related toxicity may continue 
in the active treatment phase of the study receiving ipatasertib/placebo monotherapy as 
per the investigator’s discretion.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ipatasert ib/Placebo  
The ipatasertib/placebo dose reduction instructions provided in Table  2 are intended to 
serve as recommended guidelines to allow ong oing treatment for patients without signs 
or symptoms of disease progression while monitoring patient safety.  Guidelines for 
implementing dosage modifications and treatment interruption or discontinuation for 
patients who experience specific adverse event s are provided in Section  5.1.1 .

Refer  to the local prescribing information for other guidance.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prednisone/Prednisolone  
The dose of prednisone/prednisolone may be decreased to 5  mg daily for adverse 
effects or taken as 10  mg once da ily, at the discretion of the investigator.  In  the event 
discontinuation of  prednisone/prednisolone is necessary for the management of 
study  treatment related adverse events, it may be replaced by [CONTACT_76970].  Patients may continue other study treatments despi[INVESTIGATOR_76920]/prednisolone.  For patients who were taking chronic prednisone 
 10 mg/day (or equivalent) prior to start of study treatment, the total daily dose of 
prednisone with study treatment will be 10  mg/day (or less, if decreased by [CONTACT_1697]).  
Any overdose or incorrect administration of prednisone/prednisolone will not be collected 
as an adverse ev ent unless accompanied with concurrent symptoms.

The [COMPANY_002] Global Policy on Continued Access to Investigational Medicinal Product is 
available at the following website:  
http://www.roche.com/policy_continued_access_to_invest igational_medicines.pdf  
 
Participants who are still receiving ipatasertib after the final OS analysis may be 
eligible to receive ipatasertib via a post -trial access program or as part of an extension 
study.  
4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY,  PROHIBITED THERAPY,  AND 
EXCL UDED DRUGS  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over ‑the‑counter 
drugs, vaccines, homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 
7 days before the screening visit (or [ADDRESS_83849]) until [ADDRESS_83850] be 
recorded on the concomitant medication  eCRF.  
Concurrent use or initiation of bisphosphonates, or other approved 
bone‑targeting  agents, and standard -of-care steroid and pain management are allowed 
and should not result in discontinuation of study treatment.  All such medications should 
be recor ded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF until initiation of a subsequent line of 
therapy and identified for their use as pain relief.  
Because the hyperglycemia observed with ipatasertib treatment is consistently 
associated with endogenous elevations in ins ulin, insulin -based therapy to manage any 
hyperglycemia should be used with caution because severe hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_76921].  Therefore, initial treatment should be considered with metformin 
(preferred), sulfonylureas, and other hypogl ycemic treatments.  
Focal palliative radiotherapy (e.g., external -beam radiotherapy to address single sites of 
disease) for preexisting bone metastasis or other oncology ‑related  issues may be 
considered; however, patients should be evaluated for evidence of  radiographically 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
49/Protocol CO39303 , Version [ADDRESS_83851] 7  days before and after the procedure 
(at least 14  days after radiation is recommended).  After the temporary treatment hold is 
complete, study  treatment may be re -initiated when the patient has sufficiently 
recovered.  
Diarrhea is observed with ipatasertib and abiraterone, and patients will be asked to be 
cognizant of the onset, duration, severity, and frequency of symptoms.  Treatments such 
as loperamide (racecadotril as used in Europe), a loperamide/simethicone combination, 
or bismuth subsalicylate are options for treatment.  Additional details are provided 
in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
4.4.2  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76922]:  
 Cytotoxic chemotherapy, systemic radiopharmaceuticals (e.g.,  radium‑223, 
strontium ‑89, excluding imaging agents), alternate anti -hormone  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(e.g.,  enzalutamide), or other investigational agents for the treatment of prostate 
cancer are not allowed.  
– Initiation of any of these treatments requires discontinuation of study treatment.  
 Quini dine or other anti -arrhythmic agents with a narrow therapy window.  
 Systemic corticosteroid use ( 20 mg of prednisone or prednisolone or an equivalent 
dose of other anti -inflammatory corticosteroids) for  7 days or use of other 
immunosuppressant agents  
 Chronic use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer, or sensitive CYP3A and 
CYP2D6  substrates with a narrow therapeutic window that are deemed not 
permissible by [CONTACT_76974] (refer to the guidance below).  Patients are permitted to take moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 with caution.  
 Concomitant use of herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33401], safety profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are generally 
unknown.   However, herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76923] . 
– Formulations containing St.  John’s Wort are prohibited due to 
CYP3A4  induction.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Protocol -Specific Guidance on CYP450 Drug Interactions  
 Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, such as  but not limited to atazanavir, clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
50/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole, and/or grapefruit juice o r grapefruit 
supplements  
– Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases ipatasertib AUC and C max by 
[CONTACT_3450] 5 -fold and 2 -fold, respectively (DDI  Study  GP30057).  Given that 
ipatasertib is a substrate of CYP3A4/5, other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 /5 may 
also result in an increase in ipatasertib exposure.  
 Strong CYP3A4/5 inducers, such a, but not limited to rifampin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
rifapentine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and/or St. John’s  wort or hyperforin  
– In vitro data suggest that abiraterone and ipatasertib are partially metabolized 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers in vivo have shown 
to reduce their exposure by [CONTACT_3450] 50%.  
 CYP3A4/5 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index  
– In vitro data suggest that ipatasertib is a ti me-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, 
and in vivo data of ipatasertib have been shown to moderately increase 
CYP3A4 substrate midazolam exposure by [CONTACT_3450] 2.2 -fold. 
 CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index  
– In vitro data suggest that abiratero ne is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, and 
in vivo data of abiraterone have been shown to moderately increase CYP2D6 
substrates exposure by [CONTACT_3450] 2.8 to 2.9 -fold. 
 
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or use of sensitive 
CYP3A  substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment (i.e.,  an 
alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and ipatasertib/placebo 
should be temporarily held until at least [ADDRESS_83852] a narrow therapeutic index.  If an alternative 
treatment cannot be used, exercise caution and consider a dose reduction of the 
concomitant CYP2D6 substrate (refer to abi raterone prescribing information).

4.5 STUDY ASSESS MENTS   
Please see Appendix  1 for the schedule of activities to be performed during the study.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
51/Protocol CO39303 , Version [ADDRESS_83853] be performed and documented for each patient.  Patients will be 
closely monitored for safety and tol erability throughout the study.  Patients should be 
assessed for toxicity prior to each dose when administered in the clinic; dosing will occur 
only if the clinical assessment is acceptable.  
4.5.[ADDRESS_83854] reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
If eligibility assessments for PTEN tumor testing and/or CT/MRI are not completed within 
28 days prior to planned date of Cycle  1, Day 1, bone scans are not completed within 
42 days prior to planned da te of Cycle  1, Day 1, or if appropriate wash -out for 
medications/procedures per exclusion criteria have not been fulfilled during screening 
window prior to the planned date of Cycle 1, Day 1, the patient will need to be 
rescreened for eligibility.  Rescree ning refers to repeating the entire screening process 
except for assessments that are still within the 28 -day window.  In  the case of 
rescreening, and if required by [CONTACT_1295], HBV, HCV, HIV testing from the initial 
screening may be acceptable for s creening assessment if performed  60 days from 
Cycle  1, Day 1.  Patients will be allowed to be rescreened only once.  Blood samples 
may be redrawn because of sample handling problems, breakage, or sample integrity, 
without the patient being considered a r escreen.  
4.5.2  Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases within the previous 5  years, 
surgeries, complete cancer history (including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), 
complete cardiovascular history, repro ductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol, 
and drugs of abuse.  In addition, all medications (e.g.,  prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used 
by [CONTACT_4672] 7 days before screening (or [ADDRESS_83855]) will be recorded.  
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.  
4.5.3  Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination should be perfor med at screening and at study 
treatment discontinuation visit and should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
52/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologica l systems.  Any abnormality identified at 
baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions 
eCRF.  
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed.  Chan ges from baseline abnormalities should be 
recorded in patient notes.  New  or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be 
recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
4.5.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , pulse (heart) rate systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures while the patient is in a seated position, and oral, axilla, or 
tympanic temperature.  Oxygen saturation will be assessed by [CONTACT_61871] 
(optional).  Record abnormalities observed at ba seline on the General Medical History 
and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), record 
new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
4.5.5  ECOG Performance Status  
Performance status will be measured using the ECOG Performance Status scale 
(see Appendix  3) and recorded on the eCRF.  
4.5.6  Tumor and Response Evaluations  
On the basis of  the recommendations of the PCWG3 guidelines (Scher et al. 2016), 
tumor assessments will be performed at screening, every 8 weeks (approximately every 
two cycles) following randomization for 24 weeks (i.e., Cycles 2, 4, and 6), and every 
12 weeks thereafte r (i.e., Cycles 9 and every three cycles after) regardless of dose 
delays.  Any measurable and non -measurable disease should be documented at 
screening and re -assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Baseline tumor 
assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI within  28 days and by [CONTACT_76975] 
42 days of Cycle  1, Day 1.  Subsequent tumor assessments during the study should be 
performed  [ADDRESS_83856] recent assessment 
was completed  28 days before the treatment completion visit or radiographically 
assessed disease progression has already been confirmed.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than confirme d 
radiographically assessed disease progression (e.g.,  toxicity) should continue to 
undergo scheduled tumor assessments per the protocol schedule until death, the 
patients experiences confirmed radiographically assessed disease progression per 
PCWG3 guidel ines, the patient withdraws consent, or the study is closed, whichever 
occurs first.  Tumor assessments should continue regardless  of whether  the patient 
starts a new anti -cancer therapy in the absence of confirmed radiographically assessed 
disease progres sion unless the patient withdraws consent.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
53/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 After the final OS analysis, tumor assessments will no longer be required at 
study  visits for patients who are still on ipatasertib treatment , but they should be 
performed as per local practice and at the investigator ’s discretion in order to monitor 
for possible tumor progression and whether  the patient is in need for a new cancer 
therapy.  These  tumor assessment data will  not be collected.   Patients who are in the 
placebo arm and are receiving abiraterone only will no longer be required to attend 
study visits after the final OS analysis.  These patients will be followed up by 
[CONTACT_76976].  
Response assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_11168], on the basis of CT  or MRI 
scans, acc ording to RECIST v1.1 (see  Appendix  5) for soft tissue disease and on the 
basis of bone scan according PCWG3  criteria  (see Appendix  6) for the bone lesions.  
The same imaging method and serum marker  tests used at screening must be  used 
throughout the study.  A documented standard -of-care tumor assessment  performed 
within 28  days before  Cycle  1, Day 1 may be used for the screening  assessment, 
provided it meets  the following  requirements:  
 CT scans are the preferred imaging modality for soft tissue tumor assessment s.  
Tumor  assessments should include a diagnostic quality, contrast -enhanced CT  scan 
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline.  CT scans of other body region(s)  
should be included if clinically  indicated.  To be suitable for RECIST  v1.[ADDRESS_83857], abdomen, 
and pelvis (and other known body region[s] if applicable).  In addition to the  
scheduled on -protocol CT scans, CT scans  may be performed at the  investigator’s 
discretion at any time  if progressive disease is suspected.  
 In patients for whom a CT scan is contraindicated because of an allergy to  
CT IV contrast, a CT of the chest without contrast and MRI of the  abdomen and 
pelvis with contrast are recommended.  
 MRI scans may be performed in lieu of  CT scans.  
 In case MRI measurements are performed, the following conditions should be met:  
– At screening, tumor assessments should include a diagnostic quality,  
contrast -enhanced MRI  scan of the chest, abdomen, and  pelvis.  
– MRI scans of other body region(s) should be  included if clinically indicated.  
– To be suitable for RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_83858], abdomen, and pelvis (and 
other  known body region[s] if applicable).  
– In addition to the scheduled on -protocol MRI scans,  MRI scans may be 
repeated at  the investigator’s discretion at any time if  progressiv e disease is 
suspected.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
54/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8  Bone lesions should be assessed by [CONTACT_76977]3 criteria.  
During study treatment, the bone scan may be performed with  1 week for flexibility 
in the event of isotope shortage; the Medical Monitor should be con tacted if the scan 
cannot be performed within allowed time window.  For adequate assessment of 
bone lesions, it is expected that the radiologist will adjust window leveling 
accordingly.  If  progressive disease is suspected only on the basis of new lesions 
detected by [CONTACT_15222], a confirmatory bone scan MUST be performed at least 
6 weeks after the initial scan which showed disease progression.  Bone scans done 
prior to Week  12 of study treatment may show a false positive due to “flare” 
phenomenon and should not be considered a confirmatory scan for disease 
progression (see Appendix  7 for guidance).  
 PSA samples collected will be tested at a centra l laboratory obtained on Day  1 of 
each cycle starting with Cycle  1.  If medically indicated, additional PSA samples 
maybe collected and tested locally.  Patients with rising PSA levels only (i.e.,  in the 
absence of radiographic or clinical disease progression) should remain on study 
treatment per PCWG3 criteria and recommendations.  
 
4.5.7  Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples  
Laboratory samples should be  drawn according to the schedule of activities 
(see Appendix  1 and Appendix  2).  Screening local laboratory asses sments obtained 
 [ADDRESS_83859] to be repeated for Cycle  1, Day 1. 
 Hematology:  complete blood count, including RBC count,  hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
WBC count with differential (neutrophils [bands, segmented optional], eosinophil s, 
basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other cells), and platelet count  
 Coagulation (aPTT, PT, and INR)  
 Fasting blood glucose (may be obtained by a glucometer [fingerstick])  
 Chemistry panel:  BUN or urea, creatinine,  sodium, potassium, chloride, 
magnesi um, phosphorus, bicarbonate, uric acid, calcium, total protein, albumin,  total 
and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, and LDH  
 For investigational sites in countries where bicarbonate may not be collected as part 
of the standard chemistry pan el, bicarbonate will not be measured.  
 Fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein, low -density  
lipoprotein, triglycerides, amylase, and lipase) performed  following  8-hour fast  
 Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
 Urinalysis:  specific gravity, pH,  glucose, protein, ketones, and blood  
 PSA (local laboratory assessment at screening, a central laboratory sample should 
also be submitted at screening  and at every cycle visit) .  After the final OS 
analysis, PSA central laboratory sample s shoul d no longer be collected.  
 Serum testosterone (local and central laboratory sample should also be assessed at 
screening and study treatment discontinuation visit).   After the final OS analysis, 
serum testosterone central laboratory samples should no longer be collected . 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
55/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8  In countries where home self -monitoring of glucose is mandatory1, self‑monitoring 
of glucose levels will be performed at least once daily by [CONTACT_76978] a "bigger 
meal" throughout the study treatment period (i.e.,  until discontinuation of 
ipatasertib/placebo).  After the final OS analysis  and patients’ unblinding, home  
glucose monitoring will be performed only for patents who are receiving 
ipatasertib.  
 
Instruction manuals and supply kits will be provided for central laboratory assessments.  
The following assessments will be performed at Genentech, at a central laborato ry, or at 
a specialty laboratory:  
 Blood samples for PK analyses (see  Appendix  2):  plasma samples to measure 
ipatasertib and abiraterone  
 Blood sample for DNA extraction to enable analysis via WGS and NGS  
 Pharmacogenomic sample (if approved by [CONTACT_31665])  
 PSA samples collected at screening and subsequently on Day  1 of every cycle to be 
tested at a central laboratory  
 In the even t that multiple  tissue  blocks  are available  for a given  patient (i.e., primary 
tumor and metastatic  site), the most recently collected tumor  sample  that fulfills  the 
criteria  listed  below  should  be submitted.  
 Evaluation  of the patient’s  archival  tumor  sample for  PTEN status  must occur prior 
to enrollment . 
– Archival or newly collected (fresh) tumor samples for central  laboratory 
assessment of PTEN loss:  All patients must consent to protocol -mandated 
exploratory assessments at baseline.  Tumor tissue shou ld be of good quality 
on the basis of total and evaluable tumor content.  Evaluation of the patient’s 
tumor sample for adequate tumor tissue content and determination of PTEN 
status by a central laboratory must occur before the initiation of study treatmen t.

laboratory manual.  
Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for 
optional exploratory research (see Section  4.5.12 ), biologic samples will be destroyed 
when the final Clinical Study Report (CSR) has been completed, with the following 
exceptions:  
 Plasma samples collected for PK analysis will be destr oyed no later than 5  years 
after the final CSR has been completed.  
 Blood samples collected for WGS will be stored until they are no longer needed or 
until they are exhausted.  
 
When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected before the date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the 
samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples.  However, 
if samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.  
Data arising from sample analysis will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section  8.4. 
4.5.8  Assay Methods for Biomarker Samples  
If multiple tumor samples that were surgically obtained at different times are submitted to 
satisfy this enrollment criterion, the assay result (i.e., tumor PTEN IHC status) will be on 
the basis of a valid result f rom the most recently collected tumor sample that meets the 
protocol tumor tissue eligibility criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ventana PTEN IHC  
The PTEN IHC assay will be performed by a central investigational testing site.  
PTEN loss is defined as a minimum of 50% of the speci men’s tumor area with no 
detectable PTEN staining in a patient’s FFPE prostate cancer sample.  A designation of 
PTEN  IHC status (e.g., PTEN loss, PTEN intact, or invalid/failed) will be assigned to a 
sample.  Patients with an “invalid” or “failed” PTEN IHC  result will not be eligible for 
enrollment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Foundation  Medicine Next -Generation Sequencing  
On samples with sufficient tumor tissue, NGS will be performed using the Foundation 
Medicine, Inc. solid tumor platform (FMI NGS).  
The FMI NGS platform detects somatic genomic alterations within hundreds of 
cancer‑related genes in tumor tissue samples.  These somatic alterations include base 
substitutions, insertions, deletions, CN alterations, and rearrangements 
(Frampton  et al. 2013 ; Sun et al. 2014).

The proposed definition of the PTEN  loss NGS classifie r by [CONTACT_76979] a 
composite group consisting of genetic abnormalities predicted to lead to a loss of 
PTEN  function as described below.  
 Homozygous deletion (CN of 0)  
 Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are predicted to contain a deleterious 
mutation, described below, with a concomitant loss of the non -mutant PTEN  allele 
defined by [CONTACT_76980]   1 (LOH1) or loss of heterozygosity with 
CN  1 (LOHx)  
 LOH1 without concomitant SNVs that is predicted to be a deleterious mutation  
 Known dominant negative SNV (e.g., C124S, G129E, R130X; Papa et al. 2014); 
details to be provided in the SAP  
 
It is anticipated that approximately 40% of patients with mCRPC would be classified as 
part of a PTEN -loss sample using this definition.  
Additional e xploratory analyses may be performed to assess for associations between 
somatic alterations identified by [CONTACT_76981].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Circulating -Tumor DNA and RNA Analysis  
Circulating -tumor DNA and RNA may be extracted from plasma samples collected from 
patients and used for the detection of oncogenic mutations, copy number changes, 
DNA  methylation, and/or RNA expression using appropriate technologies.  
The prevalence of the mutations me asured at baseline and after treatment may provide 
information on response or resistance to therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Messenger RNA Expression Profiling  
In cases where there is sufficient archival tissue to isolate RNA, gene expression may be 
performed using gene expressio n assays conducted using appropriate technologies.  
Analysis may include the entire transcriptome or a limited panel of genes that are 
important for prostate cancer biology, immune oncology, and signaling related to the AR 
and PI3K pathways.

59/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 4.5.10  PROs  
To more fully characterize the clinical profile of ipatasertib, patients will rate their 
symptoms an d their functioning impacts through use of the following instruments:  the 
EORTC  QLQ -C30 and selected items from the Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate 
Cancer Module (QLQ -PR25), pain severity NRS, selected items from the PRO -CTCAE, 
and the EQ -5D-5L.  In addition, patients will record their analgesic medication 
consumption in a log from Cycle  1, Day 1 to initiation of the next line of prostate cancer 
therapy.  
Patients will complete these assessments as follows:  
 Pain severity at its worst (24 -hour recall ) NRS will be captured at screening to be 
used for inclusion.  
 A medication analgesic log will be completed, starting on Cycle  1, Day [ADDRESS_83862].  
 Selected  items from the PRO -CTCAE will be completed by [CONTACT_76984] 1 on Days  1, 8, 
and 15; from Cycle  2 to Cycle  6 on Days  1 and  15; and on Day 1 of each 
subsequent cycle and as clinically indicated while on study treatment.  
 The pain severity at its worst (7 -day reca ll) NRS, the EORTC QLQ -C30, the 8 ‑item 
urinary scale from the QLQ -PR25, and the EQ -5D-5L (including VAS) will be 
completed on Cycle  1, Day 1 and every cycle thereafter until the end of treatment 
visit (included) and as clinically indicated.  In addition, t hese questionnaires will be 
completed approximately every 28 days from treatment discontinuation (for any 
reason) to initiation of subsequent line of therapy.  
 Selected scales from the EORTC QLQ -C30 (physical functioning [PF], role 
functioning [RF], global health status [GHS]), the pain severity at its worst 
(7‑day recall) NRS, and the EQ -5D-5L in its entirety will be completed by [CONTACT_76985] [ADDRESS_83863], until death.  Patients will be asked (i.e.,  not 
part of the electronic device) to report any recent (7 -day) analgesic uses (response: 
yes or no). 
 
The pain severity at its worst (24 -hour recall) NRS completed at screening at the site will 
be admin istered on paper and documented on the appropriate eCRF.  
It is imperative that each PRO questionnaire and NRS be completed on Cycle  1, Day 1 
until initiation of subsequent line of therapy, disregarding treatment discontinuation.  
All PRO questionnaires and  NRS that are completed at the clinic are required to be 
completed prior to any study assessment(s) that could bias patient responses.  
The questionnaires and NRS will be translated in the country language(s) and as 
feasible in the local language.  
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
60/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 Patients will use an electronic device to capture all PRO data.  Instructions to use the 
device and to complete the PRO questionnaires and medication log will be provided by 
[CONTACT_76986].  
If needed, back -up paper forms will be available to ensure collection of PRO data from 
each patient.  The data will be transmitted to a centralized database maintained by [CONTACT_76987].  
After the final OS analysis , PROs data and analgesics medication consumption 
information will no longer be collected (see  Appendix  1).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  EORTC QLQ -C30 and Urinary Scale from QLQ -P25 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 (see  Appendix  8) consists of 30 questions that assess five 
aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and  social), 
three  symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), GHS/quality of life (QoL), 
and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and 
financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week (van  Andel  et al. 2008).  
In addition, an 8 -item urinary scale from the EORTC prostate module 
(EORTC  QLQ -PR25; see  Appendix  9) will be added to capture symptom -specific to 
prostate cancer (Dąbrowska -Bender et al. 2015).  
All items other than those forming the GHS scale are rated on a 4 -point categorical 
scale.  A high score (4) for a functional scale represents a high or healthy level of 
functioning, a high score (7) for the GHS/QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score 
for a symptom scale or item represents a high level o f symptomatology or problems.  
To understand patients’ symptom experience post -treatment and the course of their 
health -related QoL, the PF, RF, and GHS scales will be completed as part of the 
follow -up visits.  These scales were selected for their content validity in documenting 
patients’ functioning in daily activities and QoL.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pain Assessments  
Cancer -related pain will be assessed using a patient report of pain severity at its worst 
and rated on a [ADDRESS_83864] outcome.  This ass essment is a 
commonly used assessment across diseases and treatments.  Patients will complete the 
pain severity assessment (24 -hour recall) at screening; this recall period was selected to 
account for the fact that patients will have had no training to app ropriately recall their 
pain experience over a longer time period.  Following randomization, patients will 
complete the pain severity assessment (7 -day recall) at each visit.  Recognizing that a 
monthly assessment using a short assessment window (past 24  hours) would provide 
only limited information of patients’ experience with signs of clinical deterioration, the 
assessment window was broadened to 7 days.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Medication Log  
A country -specific patient -reported medication log will be used to document analgesic 
use for cancer -related  pain, particularly opi[INVESTIGATOR_76925] (e.g.,  name [CONTACT_77066], form, 
number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/patch) from Cycle  1, Day 1 to initiation of the next line of prostate cancer 
therapy.  The patient medication log should be used when completing the concomitant 
medications eC RF pages for the consumption of analgesics for cancer -related pain.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PRO -CTCAE  
The PRO -CTCAE is an item bank reflecting 78 symptomatic adverse events rated 
according to their severity, interference with daily function, frequency, and/or occurrence.  
The item bank was designed and validated as a repository of stand -alone items.  
Symptoms selected for this study include those symptoms occurring in  15% of patients 
for any treatment (ipatasertib and/or abiraterone) and/or those with a Grade  3 event, 
with i ncidence of  5% in the treatments of any treatment (ipatasertib and/or 
abiraterone), and/or those with a Grade  3 with incidence of  5% in the treatments of 
any study arm.  
Only adverse events relevant for patient reporting, as being subjective, with or without 
observable components (e.g., vomiting and nausea, respectively) or primarily observable 
with subjective components (e.g., rash), were selected (Basch et al. 2014).  
Adverse  events of which assessments relied on laboratory testing (e.g., anemia) tha t 
were presented as being primarily asymptomatic or with non -specific signs and 
symptoms (e.g.,  hyperglycemia) were disregarded.  Adverse events that did not have an 
identifiable symptom equivalent in the PRO -CTCAE were also excluded.  Lastly, 
considering patients’ completion burden, symptoms with substantial coverage across 
PRO measures (e.g., pain) were also excluded from the pool.  Based on the above 
criteria, eight symptomatic adverse events were selected from the PRO ‑CTCAE 
item bank, namely decreased a ppetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, rash, 
and fatigue , representing a total of 11  items.  The free -text item from the PRO ‑CTCAE 
item bank was not included.  
An additional item providing an overall assessment of symptom tolerability was added to 
the [ADDRESS_83866] PRO -CTAE items (see  Appendix  12). 
Based on the data available to date regarding the tolerability of ipatasertib in 
combination with abiraterone, the targeted symptomatic adverse events should have 
occurred by [CONTACT_51199]  6.  Therefore, patients will be asked to complete the 11 -item 
PRO -CTCAE  1 tolerability item on Days  1, 8, and  15 of Cycle  1, on Days  1 and 15 of

[IP_ADDRESS]  EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a validated self -report health status questionnaire that is used to 
calculate a health status utility score for use in health economic analyses 
(EuroQoL  Group 1990; Brooks  1996; Herdman  et al. 2011; Janssen et al. 2013).  There 
are two components to th e EQ -5D-5L:  a five -item health state profile that assesses 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a 
VAS that measures health state.  Published weighting systems allow for the creation of a 
single composi te score of the patient’s health status.  The EQ -5D-5L will be used in this 
study to inform pharmacoeconomic evaluations (see  Appendix  13). 
4.5.11  Survival Follow -Up 
Survival follow -up information will be collected via telephone calls, patient’s  medical 
records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 3 months until death,  loss to follow -up, 
or study termination by [CONTACT_2728].  All patients will be followed  for survival information 
unless the patient  requests to be withdrawn from study; this request must be  
document ed in the source file and signed  by [CONTACT_093].  If the patient withdraws 
from the study, the study staff may use a  public information source (e.g., county  records) 
to obtain information  about survival status only.   After the final OS analysis , survi val 
follow -up information will no longer be collected.  
4.5.12  Optional Samples for Research Biosample Repository  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of the Research Biosample Repository  
The Research Biosample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administered group of facilities 
used for the lon g-term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection, 
storage, and analysis of RBR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new 
pharmaceutica l agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for 
individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.  
Specimens for the RBR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  RBR spe cimens will be used to achieve the 
following objectives:  
 To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progression  
 To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology  
 To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition  
 To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays

[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Collection  
Leftover patient samples (e.g.,  blood and/or residual tumor tissue samples) collected for 
this study will be stored in the RBR and used  for research purposes, including but not 
limited to research on biomarkers related to ipatasertib or prostate cancer.  
The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for DNA extraction to 
enable analysis of germline mutations, somatic mutations via WGS, NGS, or other 
genomic analysis methods.  
Genomics is increasingly informing researchers ’ understanding of disease pathobiology.  
WGS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical 
data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_76926].  Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but will also be explored 
in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability of a larger dataset will assist 
in identification  of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
RBR specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted.  However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Confidentiality  
Specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification

[IP_ADDRESS]  Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository  
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR.  The investigator or authorized designe e will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR.  Patients will be

In the event of an RBR participant’s death or loss of competence, the participant’s 
specimens and data will con tinue to be used as part of the RBR research.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Respository  
Patients who give consent to provide RBR specimens have the right to withdraw their 
consent at any time for any reason.  After withdrawal of consent, any remai ning samples 
will be destroyed or will no longer be linked to the patient.  However, if RBR samples 
have been tested prior to withdrawal of consent, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.  If a patient wishes to withdraw  consent to the testing of 
his or her RBR samples during the study, the investigator must inform the 
Medical  Monitor in writing of the patient’s wishes through use of the appropriate RBR 
Subject Withdrawal Form and must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR Research

has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
4.6.2  Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients discont inuing study treatment for any reason other than radiographically 
assessed disease progression should continue to undergo tumor response evaluations 
until confirmed radiographic evidence of progressive disease regardless of initiation of 
another anti ‑cance r therapy.  Additionally, because the secondary endpoint of pain 
progression may occur after radiographic progression, collection of pain endpoints will 
continue to be collected on a periodic basis, until initiation of another anti ‑cancer therapy 
or up to [ADDRESS_83869].  See Section  5.1 for adverse events and 
discontinuation details.  
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN  
Ipatasertib is not approved, and clinical development is ongoing.  The safety plan for  
patients in this study is based on clinical experience with ipatasertib in completed and 
ongoing studies.  
The anticipated important safety risks for ipatasertib and abiraterone are outlined below.  
Refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for a co mplete summary of safety 
information.  Refer to the abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone local prescribing 
information for a summary of safety information.  
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this 
study.  Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for 
toxicities.  Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including 
assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events, as well as 
expedited report ing of protocol -defined adverse events of special interest regardless of 
seriousness.  In  addition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for 
dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided below to 
investigators.  Educational materials will be provided to patients outlining these safety 
guidelines.  
This study will use an iDMC .  The iDMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the 
safety of patients in the study according to the iDMC Charter.  Durin g the study, the

analysis.  The iDMC will make recommendation as to whether or no t the trial should 
continue based on ongoing reviews of safety data.  The Sponsor will designate an iDCC 
to prepare data for iDMC review.  Only if action or consultation with health authorities is 
required will other than designated Sponsor staff be involv ed.  Clinical sites will be 
restricted from access to study results until the conclusion of the study.  
5.1.1  Management of Selected Identified and Potential Risks of 
Ipatasertib and Abiraterone  
Guidelines for managing selected adverse events are provided in this  section to improve 
safety and tolerability; however, patients may be treated per institutional practices as 
appropriate.  If  any observed toxicity is attributable to only one drug as assessed by [CONTACT_1275], the dose of the other drug may not require  modification.  Reasons for dose 
modifications (interruptions or reduction) or delays, the supportive measure taken, and 
the outcome will be recorded in the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diarrhea  
For diarrhea occurring after Cycle  2 that persists for more than 5 days, despi[INVESTIGATOR_76927] -diarrheal agent, a stool culture for infectious workup (i.e.,  Clostridium 
difficile , enteric bacteria, CMV) will be obtained, and diarrhea should be treated with the 
appropriate antibiotic.

Interrupt ipatasertib/placebo until diarrhea improves to Grade   1. 
Ipatasertib/placebo should be reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (see  Table  2) 
when treatment is restarted.  
For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea, reduce ipatasertib/placebo dose by [CONTACT_76994] (see  Table  2), or permanently discontinue 
ipatasertib/placebo per investigator discretion.  
Grade 4  Management as per Grade 3 guidelines.  Permanently discontinue 
ipatasertib/placebo.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fasting Hyperglycemia  
Fasting is defined as abstaining from food and drink (with the exception of water)  for at 
least 8  hours.  
Dose modification guidelines for fasting hyperglycemia attributable to study treatment 
are outlined below (see  Table  4) and are intended to provide guidance for fasting 
glucose measurements assessed in the clinic.  Decisions regarding s tudy treatment 
should be made on fasting levels drawn in the clinic whenever possible.  
Home glucose measurements may be used to trigger contact [CONTACT_76995] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
69/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 glucose.  Guidance for when to call the investigator/site staff (or designated 
endocrinologist, if applicable) should be provided to patients for hypoglycemia 
(e.g.,  glucose value under 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L] ) and hyperglycemia (e.g.,  glucose 
value over 300  mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L] ).  Alternative thresholds may be selected as 
clinically indicated per investigator discretion or institutional guidance and noted in the 
source documents.  For any patients performing home glucose monitoring, a blood 
glucose log should  be reviewed at each clinic visit (and source data retained); entry of 
results into the patient’s eCRF will be limited to values, which result in intervention.  
In the event of ipatasertib/placebo interruption, anti -diabetic medications may need to be 
held or reduced (per investigator judgement) and glucose should be monitored closely to 
minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.  
Ipatasertib/placebo should be discontinued for recurrent Grade  4 fasting hyperglycemia 
or a single event of hyperglycemia Grade  3 associ ated with metabolic acidosis 
Grade   3.

therefore be any of the following : 
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
 Any new disease or exacerbation of a n existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described 
in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]

baseline  
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g.,  ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug  
 Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)  
 
5.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or lead s to death)  
 Is life threatening (i.e.,  the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)  
– This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue might ha ve caused death.  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug  
 Is a significant medical even t in the investigator’s judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)  
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adver se event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to 
NCI CTCAE  v4.0; see  Section  5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see  Section  5.4.2  for 
reporting instruc tions).  
5.2.[ADDRESS_83880] (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
76/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 see Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this 
study include the following:  
 Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]’s law (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below:  
– Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g.,  prion protein 
transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an 
infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory 
findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  
This term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.  
 Grade  3 diarrhea  
 Grade  3 hyperglycemia  
 Grade  3 rash  
 Grade  2 pneumonitis  
 Grade  2 colitis/enterocolitis  
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING F OR CAPTURING AND ASS ESSING 
SAFETY  PARAMETERS  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see  Section  5.2.1  for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event  eCRF and reported to  the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections  5.4−5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section  5.2.2  for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section  5.3.3 ), and causality (see  Section  5.3.4 ). 
5.3.[ADDRESS_83881].  
All adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743],  will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
After informed consent  has been obtained but before initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g.,  invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section  5.4.2  for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).  
After initiation of study drug , all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_83882].  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
77/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in  Section  5.6. 
5.3.2  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints .  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:  
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"  
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3  Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table  9 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.  
Table  9 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically 
Listed in NCI CTCAE  
Grade  Severity  
1 Mild; asympt omatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
78/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 5.3.4  Assessment of Causality of  Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, ind icating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see 
also Table  10 ): 
 Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug  
 Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (as applicable)  
 Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments  
 Known association of the event with the disease under study  
 Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications kno wn to 
increase the occurrence of the event  
 Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event  
 
Table  10 Causal Attribution Guidance  
Is the adverse event suspecte d to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?  
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuat ion of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if  applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .   
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than t he study drug 
(e.g.,  preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
or concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_83884] dose of study drug).  
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_83885] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
79/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 [IP_ADDRESS]  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
For adverse events, a diagnos is (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse  Event 
eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g.,  record only liver failure or 
hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if  a 
constellation of signs and/or sy mptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously 
reported adverse events bas ed on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting date that 
corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events That Are Secondar y to Other Events  
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g.,  cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant seco ndary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
 If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiti ng should be reported on the eCRF.  
 If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.  
 If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both  events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
 If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three  events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
 If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
 
All adverse events should be recorded separ ately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity s hould also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; 
see Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be 
updated by  [CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that 
the event became seri ous, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse 
events.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
80/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event  on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by [CONTACT_77000]  
 Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinical ly significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as a n adverse event.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5   ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e.,  cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the nor mal range 
(e.g.,  "elevated LDH" as opposed to "abnormal LDH").  If the laboratory abnormality can 
be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term 
should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an  elevated ser um potassium 
level of 7.0  mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign  result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
 Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
81/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertension) should be record ed on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3  baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin ( 2  ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s  law).  T herefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin  2  ULN (of which  35% is direct bilirubin)  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in combination with 
clinical  jaundice  
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see   Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event  or an adverse event of special interest 
(see Section  5.4.2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths  
Deaths that are attributed by [CONTACT_77001].  During the study 
adverse event reporting period (as defined in  Section  5.3.1 ) all other deaths, regardless 
of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section  5.4.2 ).  Instructions for reporting 
deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in  Section  5.6.  
An independent monitoring committee will monitor the frequency of deaths from all 
causes.  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If  the 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
82/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should  
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g.,  "sudden cardiac death").  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is prese nt at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  
When  recording such events on the  Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the 
concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g.,  "more frequent headaches").  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lack o f Efficacy or Worsening of mCRPC  
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events.  These  data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST  v1.1 and PCWG3 criteria.  In rare cases, the 
determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration.  
However, every effort should be made to document progression through  use of objective 
criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, 
it should be reported as an adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76930], and should not be reported  as an adverse event.  
Any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e.,  inpatient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25676] a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in  Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.  
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:  
– The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33403].  
– The patient has not experienced an adverse event.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76931] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
83/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76932] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76933].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient -Reported Outcome Data  
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by [CONTACT_1034], and safety 
analyses will not be performed using PRO data.  No attempt will be made to reconcile 
the findings from reports of treatment -related symptoms by [CONTACT_47656] (NCI  CTCAE) 
and from the patients (NCI PRO -CTCAE) given the different ways in which these 
two data sources are collected.  
Although sites are not expected to review the PRO data, it is possible that an 
investigator could become aware of PRO data that may be indicative of an 
adverse  event.  Under these circumstances, the investigator will determine whether the 
criteria for an adverse event have been met, and, if so, will report the event on the 
Adverse Ev ent eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cases of Accidental Overdose, Medication Error, Drug Abuse, 
or Drug Misuse  
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse 
Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "specia l 
situations"), are defined as follows:  
 Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
 Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned  dose  
 Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug  
– In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.  
 Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead to addiction or 
dependen ce, physical harm, and/or psychological harm  
 Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not 
qualify as drug abuse  
– In cases where drug is to be self -administered by [CONTACT_102], drug misuse 
could involve the drug being adm inistered to someone other than the patient.  
 
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events but may result in adverse 
events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the  associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria  or qualifies as an adverse event of special interest , the event should 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e.,  no more than 24  hours after learning of the 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
84/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 event; see  Section  5.4.2 ).  For ipatasertib, placebo, and abiraterone, adverse events

As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require 
two entries on the Adve rse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and 
one entry to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" 
boxes would need to be checked for both entries.

6. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS A ND ANALYSIS PLAN  
All analyses discussed in this section will be restricted to the patients enrolled in the 
global enrollment phase only (i.e., excluding the China extension cohort), unless 
otherwise noted.  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
Approximately 1100 pa tients in total will be randomized into this study in about 
20 months.  Assuming 50% prevalence of IHC PTEN -loss tumors in all patients, it’s 
estimated that approximately [ADDRESS_83897] PTEN loss tumors.  
6.1.1  Type I Error Control  
The overall type I erro r () for this study is 0.05 (two -sided).  Type  I error will be 
controlled for the following efficacy endpoints:  
 Co-primary efficacy endpoints:  Investigator -assessed rPFS (per PCWG3  criteria, 
see Section  6.4.1 ) in the ITT population and in patients with PTEN ‑loss tumors 
by [CONTACT_4658] 
 Key secondary endpoints:  OS in the ITT population and in patients with 
PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77006] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
89/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 Type I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_77007]  2). 
Figure  2 Type I Error Control  
 
Dx   diagnosis; ITT   intent to treat; OS   overall survival ; rPFS   radiographic 
progression ‑free survival . 
 
Testing of rPFS  
Both rPFS in the ITT population and in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77008]:  
 Firstly, test the null hypothesis of no difference in rPFS between the two  arms in 
patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77009] -rank test with 
significance level  of 0.05.  
 If the null hypothesis of test 1 described above is rejected,  of 0.05 will then be 
passed along and allocated between rPFS in the ITT population (0.01) and OS in 
patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658] (0.04).  That is, rPFS in the ITT population 
will be tested using the stratified log -rank test with significance level  of 0.01.  
Testing of OS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658]  
 OS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77010] i n 
patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658] (i.e., test 1 described above) is positive with 
 of 0.05.  If the test of rPFS in the ITT population (i.e., test 2  described above) is 
also positive with  of 0.01, then the OS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by I HC 
will be tested with  of 0.05; otherwise the OS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by 
[CONTACT_77011]  of 0.04.  When the test of rPFS in patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658] (i.e., test 1 described above) is passed, at the time of the 
primary analysis of rPFS, an interim analysis of OS in patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumors by [CONTACT_77012].  The interim analysis boundary for 
statistical significance will be determined based on the Lan -DeMets  implementation 
of the O’Brien -Fleming alpha spend ing function according to the type  I error   
allocated to this endpoint (see Figure  2 ). 

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
90/Protocol CO39303 , Version [ADDRESS_83898] of OS in patients with 
PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658] (i.e. , test 3 described above) is positive, and it will be tested 
with the same type I error  that is used for the test of OS in patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658].  At the time  of the primary analysis of rPFS, if the interim 
analysis of OS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77013], an interim 
analysis of OS in the ITT population will be performed.  At the time of final OS analysis in 
patients with PTEN -loss tumor s by [CONTACT_4658], if the test of OS in patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumors by [CONTACT_77014], an interim analysis of OS in the ITT  population will 
be performed.  The interim analysis boundary for statistical significance will be 
determined based on the Lan -DeMets impl ementation of the O’Brien -Fleming  
alpha  spending function according to the type I error  allocated to this endpoint, which 
should be the same type I error  that is used for the test of OS in patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658].  
 
6.1.2  Co-Primary Endpoint:  P rogression -Free Survival  
This study has two co -primary endpoints:  rPFS in the ITT population and rPFS in 
patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658].  At the time of primary analysis of rPFS, rPFS in 
patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77015]  of 5%.  I f the test is 
positive, then rPFS in the ITT population will be tested with  of 1%.  
The primary analysis of rPFS will occur when approximately [ADDRESS_83899] patient is randomized.  
In the PTEN -loss population, 275 events will allow for 98.4%  power to detect an 
improvement in m edian rPFS from 14 months in the placebo arm to approximately 
23 months in the ipatasertib arm (HR   0.61) at the 5% level of significance (two ‑sided).  
The largest hazard ratio deemed to be statistically significant will be approximatel y 0.79 
(with median  rPFS improvement from 14 months in the placebo arm to approximately 
17.7 months in the ipatasertib arm).  
In the ITT population, 550 events will allow for 94.5% power to detect an improvement in 
median rPFS from 16.5 months in the placebo arm to approximately 23.6  months in the 
ipatasertib arm (HR   0.70) at the 1% level of significance (two -sided).  The  largest 
hazard ratio deemed to be statistically significant will be approximately 0.80 (with 
median  rPFS improvement from 16.5 months in the plac ebo arm to approximately 
20.6 months in the ipatasertib arm.  
6.1.3  Key Secondary Endpoint:  Overall Survival  
The “final” analysis of OS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77016] 24  months after the rPFS primary analysis when there are ap proximately 
 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
91/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 327 OS events in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658] (with an assumption of 5% 
loss to follow -up for OS per two years).  It’s estimated that, for the interim analysis of OS 
in patients with PTEN -loss tumors at the time of the rPFS primary ana lysis, there are

92/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 (i.e., the China subgroup) in the combination of the global (main study) cohort and the 
China extension cohort.  
Among the approximately 200 Chinese patients in the  ITT population, 100  rPFS  events 
will allow to demonstrate approximately 83% probability of maintaining  50% of rPFS 
risk reduction from the global cohort .  It is estimated that there will be approximately 
53 rPFS events among the Chinese patients with PT EN-loss tumors that can 
demonstrate approximately 84% probability of maintaining  50% of rPFS risk reduction 
from the global cohort.

[CONTACT_2939].  
6.3 SUMMARIES OF DEMOGRA PHIC AND BASELINE 
CHARACTERISTICS  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, and race), and baseline 
disease characteristics such as presence of visceral metastasis (liver or lung; yes vs. 
no), progress ion factor (PSA only vs. other), prior taxane -based therapy in the 
hormone -sensitive setting (yes vs. no) and tumor PTEN -loss status by [CONTACT_76950] (yes 
vs. no) will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].  Continuous variables will be summarized 
with use of means, SDs, medians, and ranges.  Categorical variables will be

6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ipatasertib plus 
abiraterone compared with placebo plus abiraterone on the basis of rPFS in patients in 
the ITT population and in patients with PTEN -loss tumors determined by [CONTACT_76950].  
Efficacy analyses will include all patients who were included in the randomization, except 
for the objective response rate (ORR) analysis.  ORR a nalysis will include all patients 
with measurable disease at baseline only.  For efficacy, patients will be analyzed 
according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized.

baseline visit).  
Firstly, the primary efficacy analysis of rPFS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77024] -sided log -rank test (  0.05) using the followi ng 
factors in stratified analyses to compare rPFS between the two  treatment arms:  
 Presence of visceral metastasis (liver or lung; yes vs. no)  
 Progression factor (PSA only vs. other)  
 Prior taxane -based therapy in the hormone -sensitive setting (yes vs. no)  
 
A Cox proportional -hazards model stratified using the four factors above will be used to 
estimate the HR and 95% CI.  The results from the unstratified log -rank test will also be 
provided.  
The Kaplan -Meier approach will be used to estimate median rPFS for each 
treatment  arm, and the Kaplan -Meier curve will be constructed to provide a visual 
description of the difference between the treatment arms.  
When the primary efficacy analysis of rPFS in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77025], (i.e., a  p-value  0.05), similar methods will then be used for the 
primary efficacy analysis of rPFS in the ITT population.  The two -sided log ‑rank test 
(  0.01) stratified by [CONTACT_77026]:  
 Presence of visceral metastasis (liver or lung; yes vs. no)  
 Progression factor (PSA only vs. other)  
 Prior taxane -based therapy in the hormone -sensitive setting (yes vs. no)  
 Tumor PTEN status by [CONTACT_76950] (loss vs. non -loss)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Time to Pain Progression  
Pain severity progression refers to pain onset for those patients asymptomatic at 
baseline (i.e., patients with a score of [ADDRESS_83906] on the 
10‑point  NRS) or pain worsening for those patients who are mildly symptomatic at 
baseline (score of 2 or 3).   Pain severity progression is defined as a  2‑point 
absolute  increase from baseline.  
Pain severity progression at a given timepoint will be considered clinically meanin gful if 
followed by [CONTACT_39132]:  
 A subsequent pain severity assessment within approximately [ADDRESS_83907] is stable or increased  
 Initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_76934] (AQA) score within approximately 28  days following the 
initial pain event.  AQA scores range from 0 to 7, in which a score of 0 is no 
analgesic use and a score of 7 is strong opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (Chung et al. 2014).  The  QA 
score will be ca lculated based on the consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_76935].  Equianalgesic potency conversions and AQA are displayed in  Appendix  11. 
 Initiation of palliative radiotherapy within approximately 28  days following the initial 
pain event  
 Any increase i n glucocorticosteroids usage for the intent of treating cancer pain 
within approximately 28 days following the initial pain event  
 In the absence of further pain assessments and initiation of analgesic or palliative 
therapy, documentation of death attributa ble to cancer progression (not death of 
other causes, including adverse events) within a [ADDRESS_83908] at follow -up 
 
Note that an initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_76936] -related  pain be defined as an 
increase from a score 0 or 1 at the time of the initial pain event to a score of  [ADDRESS_83909] occurrence of a confirmed clinically meaningful cancer -related pain progression 
event.  
All patients who underwent randomization will be included in the time to pain progression 
analysis.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Objective Response Rate  
An objective response is defined as a CR or PR on two  consecutive occasions  [ADDRESS_83913] an objective response in patients 
with measurable disease at baseline.  An estimate of ORR will  be calculated for each 
treatment arm, and its 95% CI will be calculated using the Blyth -Still-Casella  method.  
ORR will be compared between treatment arms using the stratified 
Cochran ‑Mantel‑Haenszel  test.  The stratification factors will be the same as those 
described for the analysis of the primary endpoint (see Section  6.4.1 ).  The differen ce in 
ORR between treatment arms will be calculated, and its 95% CI will be calculated using 
the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prostate -Specific Antigen Response Rate  
PSA response rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving  a PSA  decline 
 50% from baseline.  Patients without a postbaseline PSA assessment will be 
considered non -responders.  The analysis population for PSA response rate will be all 
randomized patients.  The  analysis methods will be the same as for the ORR end point 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).

The exploratory efficacy endpoints will be evaluated in patients in the ITT population and 
in patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658].  P -values will be repor ted for descriptive 
purposes.  The exploratory efficacy endpoints include IRF -assessed radiographic 
progression, PFS after next line of treatment (secondary PFS; PFS2), time to 
deterioration in health -related QoL, time to deterioration in urinary symptoms (per 
EORTC QLQ -PR25 urinary scale), time to deterioration in fatigue (per EORTC QLQ -C30 
fatigue scale, clinical PFS, and PRO -CTCAE.  Analyses will be performed as data allows 
as described in the SAP.  
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES  
Safety analyses will be conducted in all  patients who were randomized and received any 
amount of ipatasertib, placebo, or abiraterone (the safety -evaluable population).  
Patients will be analyzed accordingly to the treatment arm associated with the actual 
regimen received.  Specifically, a patien t will be included in the ipatasertib plus 
abiraterone arm in the safety analyses if this patient receives any amount of ipatasertib, 
regardless of the initial treatment assignment at randomization.  
Safety endpoints will include incidence, severity, and se riousness of adverse events, 
deaths, and clinically significant laboratory measurement.  
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_77030].  All adverse events occurring during or after the first dose o f 
study treatment until the end of the adverse event reporting window will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_2939].  In addition, serious adverse events, adverse events of special 
interest, and adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation will be summarized  
accordingly.  Multiple occurrences of the same event will be counted once at the 
maximum severity.  
Deaths will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].  
Laboratory data with values outside the normal ranges will be identified.  In addition, 
selected laboratory data  will be summarized by [CONTACT_70165].  
Drug exposure will be summarized to include duration of treatment, cumulative dose, 
and dose intensity by [CONTACT_2939].

98/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 parameters for ipatasertib.  Covariates such as patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, 
body size), may be tested for significance on PK parameters of interest.  
The PK data may be combined with the safety, efficacy, and biomarker data for 
exposure -response modeling as an exploratory objective.  PK and PK/pharmacodynamic 
analyses may be reported in separate stand -alone reports.  Additional analyses may be 
explored as warranted by [CONTACT_26739].  
Abiraterone levels will be measured on Day  15 of Cycle  1 and Day  1 of Cycle  3.  
Abiraterone trough plasma concentrations will be compared between arms (ipataser tib 
vs. placebo).  
6.7 BIOMARKER ANALYSES  
Exploratory biomarker analyses (in tumor tissues and plasma, whole blood, or serum) 
will be performed in an effort to understand the association of these markers with study 
drug response, including efficacy and/or adver se events.  Results will be presented in a 
separate report.  
WGS data will be analyzed in the context of this study and explored in aggregate with 
data from other studies to increase researchers’ understanding of disease pathobiology 
and guide the developme nt of new therapeutic approaches.  
6.8 INTERIM ANALYSES  
6.8.1  Planned Interim Safety Analyses  
An iDMC will evaluate safety data (including but not limited to serious adverse events, 
death, and adverse events of special interest) during the study on a periodic basis, 
approximately every [ADDRESS_83915] year and approximately every 6  months 
thereafter, until the time of the rPFS primary analysis (see Section  6.4.1 ), according to 
the policies and procedures detailed in an iDMC ch arter.  The Sponsor will be blinded 
until the rPFS primary analysis.  
An iDCC will prepare all summaries and analyses for the iDMC’s review.  The  safety 
summaries will include demographic data, adverse events, serious adverse events, and 
relevant laboratory  data.  
Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor and will follow a charter that 
outlines their roles and responsibilities.  Following the data review, the iDMC will provide 
a recommendation to the Sponsor whether to continue the study, amend the protocol, or 
stop the study.  The final decision will rest with the Sponsor.  
Any outcomes of the iDMC’s reviews on the safety and benefit risk balance that affect 
study conduct will be communicated in a timely manner to the investigators for 
notification o f IRB/ECs and competent authorities as required.  

 
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
99/Protocol CO39303 , Version 8 6.8.2  Planned Interim Efficacy Analyses  
No interim efficacy analyses are planned for the primary endpoint of  rPFS.  
A total of four analyses of OS are planned:  
 The first interim analysis of OS was performed at the time of primary analysis 
of rPFS.  
 The second interim analysis of OS will take place when approximately 
229 OS events in the patients with PTEN -loss tumors by [CONTACT_77031], or when the 
minimum follow -up time (from the last patient enrollment date of 17  January  2019) is 
approximately 32 months, whichever occurs later.  
 The third analysis of OS is the final analysis of OS in the patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumors by [CONTACT_4658] , and it is also the third interim analysis of OS in the 
ITT population. It is scheduled when approx imately 327  OS events in patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumors by [CONTACT_77031].  This target number of OS  event s is unchanged 
per the original Protocol Version 6, Section  6.1.3.  
 The fourth analysis of OS is the final analysis of OS in the ITT  population. It  is 
scheduled when approximately 660 OS events in the ITT  population occur.  
This target number of OS event s is unchanged per the original Protocol Version  6, 
Section  6.1.3.

interim analysis.  The iDMC charter will be updated to document potential 
recommendations the iDMC can make to the Sponsor as a result of the analysis 
(e.g.,  stop the study for futility), and the iDMC charter will also be made available to 
relevant health authorities.  
If there is a potential for the study to be stopped for futility as a result of the interim 
analysis, the threshold for declaring futility will be included in the SAP.  Additional criteria 
for recommending tha t the study be stopped for futility may be added to the 
iDMC  charter.  An interim analysis that might lead to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76938] 67% of the information in both the ITT population and patients with 
PTEN‑loss tumor s has been accumulated.  
After the primary analysis for PFS, additional OS interim analyses may be conducted to 
provide additional OS data, per the recommendation from health authorities.  
If conducted, the Lan -DeMets -spending function with an O’Brien ‑Fleming  boundary will 
be used to control the overall type I error for OS accounting for the additional OS interim 
analyses.  
6.9 CHINA SUBGROUP ANALY SES 
The primary efficacy objective of the China subgroup analysis is to evaluate whether the 
efficacy, as measur ed by [CONTACT_77033], of ipatasertib plus abiraterone compared with placebo 
plus abiraterone in the Chinese patients with mCRPC is  consistent with the efficacy 
observed in the global cohort.  Consistency is defined as maintaining  50% of risk 
reduction from the glo bal cohort.  Therefore, the China subgroup is not powered to 
demonstrate the statistical significance of efficacy and no formal hypothesis testing will 
be performed.   The results of the China subgroup analyses will be summarized in a 
separate CSR .  The sta tistical details for such analyses in the China subgroup will be 
documented in the SAP.

At screening, patients will complete one pain severity item (24 -hour recall) by [CONTACT_77037].  Upon randomization, patients will use an electronic device to capture 
PRO  data.  Back -up paper form s will be available if needed in order to capture 
patient  data.  The data from the electronic device will be transmitted to a centralized 
database maintained by [CONTACT_40893].  
Once the study is complete, the data, audit trail, and trial and system documentation will 
be archived.  The investigator will receive patient data for the site in both human ‑ and 
machine ‑readable formats on an archival -quality compact disc that must be kept with the 
study records as source data.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is 
required.  In addition, the Sponsor will receive all data in a machine -readable format.  
7.4 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT ATION  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_77038], complete, and verifiable from source  documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  Th ey include but are not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097],

Notes:  All visits should occur within ± [ADDRESS_83944] dose of study treatment no later than 7  days after 
randomization.  Unplanned visits not specified by [CONTACT_77047] (possibly inc luding PK  sample collection) may be 
performed as clinically indicated at discretion of the investigator; the associated data should be recorded on the relevant e CRF in support of an 
adverse event diagnosis or tumor assessments.   After the final OS analysis , for the patients who are still on ipatasertib , the study visits will 
occur every 3 months ( ± 7 days) instead of monthly.  The patients who are receiving abiraterone only will no longer be required to attend study 
visits.  
a Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to Cycle  1, Day 1 may 
be used; such tests do not need to be repeated for screening.  Bone scans within 42 days prior to Cycle  1, Day 1 may be used.  If  eligibility  
assessments were not completed within 28  days from the original date of the screening visit, the patient will need to be rescreened for eligibility 
(see Section  4.5.1  for details).  
b Patients who discontinue study treatment will return to the clinic for a treatment discontinuation visit within 30  (± 3) days  after the last dose of 
study treatment.  The visit at which response assessment sh ows progressive disease may be used as the treatment discontinuation visit, 
provided that all tests required at the treatment discontinuation visit are performed.  Tumor assessments at the treatment di scontinuation visit 
may be omitted if the most recent p rior assessment was performed less than [ADDRESS_83945] tumor assessment (CT  or MRI  scan and 
bone  scans) until radiographically assessed disease progression.  See Section  4.5.5  and PCWG3 guidelines.  Following initiation of a new 
anti‑cancer therapy for prostate cancer, information on disease progression fr om patient’s medical records may be used to complete disease 
follow‑up via telephone calls and/or clinic visits.  These data will not be  collected after the final OS analysis .

at screening for confirmation of eligibility (if no data are available prior to screening).  
q Regardless of PSA used for confirmation of progression disease at screening, historic values of PSA will be collected as avai lable for calculation  
of PSA velocity per PCWG3 criteria (at least three PSA values with each values  0.2 ng/dL, including the most recent value during 
androgen ‑derivation therapy, and the interval between first and last PSA value to be  8 weeks but  12 months).  A  central laboratory sample 
should also be submitted at screening and at all other timepoints.  PSA central laboratory samples will no longer be collected after the final OS 
analysis.  If medically indicated, additional PSA samples may be coll ected and tested locally.  An increase in PSA, without evidence of 
radiographic progression or unequivocal clinical progression, should not be used as a criterion to start a new systemic anti -cancer therapy during 
the study.  
r May be performed  96 hours p rior to dosing for each clinic visit during study treatment ; screening assessments performed  [ADDRESS_83953] to be repeated on Cycle  1, Day 1.  PSA may be performed  96 hours prior to dosing at each Day  1 visit.  
s Serum testosterone samples will be assessed locally and centrally at screening for determination of eligibility and at study treatment 
discontinuation to confirm testosterone remains at castration level.  Serum testosterone central laboratory samples will no longer be collected 
after the final OS analysis.  
t Hematology includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and differential count (neutrophils, bands [optional] 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and other cells).  
u For all clinic visits during study treatment, the glucose level of the patient must be performed   [ADDRESS_83954] be done  [ADDRESS_83955] be reviewed prior to further ipatasertib/placebo administration and prior to

subsequent tumor assessments, even if there a re no detectable lesions at baseline.  CT scans are the preferred imaging modality for tumor 
assessments.  MRI scans may be substituted for CT scans and the same imaging method used at screening must be used throughout  the study.  
Soft tissue responses wil l be assessed locally by [CONTACT_093] (and/or radiologists) according to RECIST v1.1 for patient management.  
All films should be submitted for central archive to enable radiologic review if determined by [CONTACT_77051] e primary 
endpoint analysis.  
z A technetium bone scan will be performed at screening (within 42  days before Cycle  1, Day 1) to evaluate for the presence of bone metastases.  
In cases of ambiguous findings on bone scan, an X -ray or CT/MRI confirmatory scan should  be performed at baseline, to ensure that ambiguous 
findings on bone scan are related to cancer and not healing bone.  For adequate assessment of bone lesions, it is expected th at the radiologist 
will adjust the window leveling accordingly (refer to the Imaging C harter).  In case of isotope shortage, the Sponsor or Medical Monitor should be 
contact[CONTACT_77052] 1  week from the allowable window.  All films should be submitted for central archive, to enable

required at study visits , but they will be performed as per lo cal practice and at the investigator ’s discretion.  Data will not be collected from 
tumor assessments performed after the final OS analysis.  
bb The pain severity at its worst (24 -hour recall) NRS at screening will be co mpleted on paper.  The PRO questionnaires, namely, the 
EORTC  QLQ‑C30 scales, urinary scale from QLQ -PR25, pain severity (7 -day recall) NRS, and EQ -5D-5L, should be completed by [CONTACT_73458] a provisioned electronic device or back -up paper forms as needed .  It is imperative that each questionnaire aforementioned is completed 
at Cycle  1, Day [ADDRESS_83958] a baseline, then on Day  1 of each cycle, at the end -of-treatment visit, and at unscheduled visits as clinically indicated.  
In addition, these questionnaires will be completed approximately every 28 days from treatment discontinuation (for any reason) to initiation of 
subsequent line of therapy.  Selected scales from the abbreviated EORTC QLQ -C30 (physical functioning [PF], role functioning [RF], global 
health status [GHS]), pain NRS, and EQ -5D-5L will also be completed after initiation of subsequent line of therapy or [ADDRESS_83959], then every 3 months until death.  The PRO -CTCAE will be completed by [CONTACT_77053]  1 Days  1, 8, 
and 15, then from Cycle  2 to Cycle  6 on Days  1 and  15, and then on Day  1 of each subsequent cycle and as clinically indicated while on study 
treatment.  All PRO questionnaires are required to be completed prior to any study assessment(s)  that could bias patient’s responses.  
PRO  data will not be  collected after the final OS analysis.  
cc Consumption of analgesics (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) will be documented by [CONTACT_77054], using the provisioned d evices or back -up 
paper forms .  These data will not be  collected after the final OS analysis.  
dd If dosing of study treatment is withheld for any reason, study day count should continue and the omitted dose will not be mad e up and will be 
reported on the eCRF as “not administered” for  that day.

MEASURABILITY OF TUM OR AT BASELINE  
DEFINITIONS  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will  be categorized measurable or 
non-measurable as follows:  
MEASURABLE TUMOR LES IONS  
Tumor Lesions.   Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a 
minimum  size of:  
 [ADDRESS_83963] or MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater 
than 5 mm) 
 10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
 [ADDRESS_83964] be  [ADDRESS_83965] scan (CT  scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow ‑up, 
only the s hort axis will be measured and followed.  See  also notes below on “Baseline 
Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions” for information on lymph  node 
measurement.  
NON -MEASURABLE TUMOR  LESIONS  
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longes t diameter  10 mm 
or pathological lymph nodes with  10 to  15 mm short axis), as well as truly 
non‑measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIO NS REGARDING LESION MEASURABILITY  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particu lar comment, as outlined below.  
Bone lesions:  
 Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, 
these  techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disap pearance of bone 
lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue com ponent 
meets the definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not  be 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if noncystic lesions are pre sent in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
 
TARGET LESIONS:  SPE CIFICATIONS BY [CONTACT_77055], using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.

129/Protocol CO39303, Version 8  Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study.  
Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option.  
Clinical Lesions.   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and  10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g.,  skin nodules).  
For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested.  
Chest X -Ray.   Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying 
new lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
CT, MRI.   CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesi ons 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_83967] due to allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a 
non‑contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at 
baseline and during the study should be guided by [CONTACT_77056].  For patients who develop contraindications to 
contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast  CT 
or MRI (enhanced o r non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the 
tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized to allow for 
comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each case should be discussed with the 
radiologist to det ermine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, 
the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward.   Care must be 
taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality and interpretation of 
non-target disease or new  lesions since the same lesion may appear to have a different 
size using a new  modality.  
Ultrasound.   Ultrasound is not useful in the assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy, Tumor M arkers, Cytology, Histology.   The utilization of 
these techniques for objective tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised.

one measurable lesion, as detailed above.  
BASELINE DOCUMENTATI ON OF TARGET AND NON -TARGET LESIONS  
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identified as target le sions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means in instances where patients have only one or 
two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four  lesions 
(two sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit  measurable) in those 
organs will be recorded as non -measurable lesions (even if the size is  [ADDRESS_83969] scan).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs,  but additionally, should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, 
on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, 
in which circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should 
be selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by [CONTACT_33490].  As noted above, pathological 
nodes that are defined as measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet 
the criterion of a short axis of  [ADDRESS_83970] in which the image is obtained (for CT  scan, this 
is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, 
or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an 
abdominal node that is reported as being 20  mm   30 mm has a short axis of 20  mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20  mm should be recorded 
as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  10 mm 
but  15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a shor t axis 
 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for  all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diamet ers.  If  lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:   
Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)  
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
131/Protocol CO39303, Version 8  into the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the  measurable dimensi on of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required and these lesions should be followed as “pres ent,” “absent,” or in rare 
cases “unequivocal progression.”  
In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ 
as a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes” or “multiple  liver metastases”).  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.  
 Complete response (CR) :  disappearance of all target lesions  
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to  10 mm.  
 Partial response (PR) :  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
 Progressive d isease (PD) :  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), 
including  baseline  
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at  least 5 mm.  
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.  
 Stable disease (SD) :  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  
 
Special No tes on the Assessment of Target Lesions  
Lymph Nodes.   Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the  actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to  10 mm on study.  This  means that 
when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of lesions may not be zero  
even if CR criteria are met since a normal lymph  node is defined as having a short axis 
 10 mm. 
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.   While in the study, all lesions 
(nodal and non -nodal) that are recorded at baseline should be recorded as actual 
measurements at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g.,  2 mm).

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
132/Protocol CO39303, Version [ADDRESS_83971] measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  
When  this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on t he CRF as follows:  
 If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  
 If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to  measure, a 
default value of 5 mm sho uld be assigned and below  measurable limit (BML) should 
be ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this  rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size  when  normal and  are frequently surrounded by 
[CONTACT_77057]; however, if  a lymph node is believed to be 
present and is  faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should 
be assigned in this circumstance as well and BML should also be ticked.)  
 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, even if it is below [ADDRESS_83972] diameter for the coalesced lesion.  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determi ne the tumor response 
for the group of non -target lesions.  While some non -target lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol.  
 CR:  disappeara nce of all non -target lesions and (if  applicable) normalization of 
tumor marker level)  
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size ( 10 mm short axis).  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
(if applicable) maintenance  of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 PD:  unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.  
 
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease  
When the Patient Also Has Measurable Disease.   In this setting, to achieve 
unequivocal progression on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall 
level of substantial worsening in non -target disease in a magnitude that, even in the 
 
Appendix  5 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:   
Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)  
Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
133/Protocol CO39303, Version [ADDRESS_83973] measurable 
disease.  The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this 
instance, there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of 
an increase in n on-measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in non -target 
disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]:  if all lesions are truly 
non‑measurable), a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consid er if the  increase in overall disease burden based 
on the change in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase 
that would be required to declare progressive disease (PD) for measurable disease, that 
is, an increase in tumor burden re presenting an additional 73%  increase in volume 
(which is equivalent to a 20%  increase in diameter in a measurable lesion).  Examples 
include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to  “large” or an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to  widespread or may be  described in protocols as 
“sufficient to require a change in therapy.”  If unequivocal progression is seen, 
the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be 
ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the very nature of 
that disease makes it impossible to  do so; therefore, the increase must be substantial.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detecti on of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imagi ng modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply healing or  flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or 
compl ete response.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a 
CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion  and will indicate disease progression.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify whether it represents truly new disease.  If  repeat scans

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
134/Protocol CO39303, Version 8  confirm there is definitely a new  lesion, then progression should be declared using the 
date of the initial scan.  
EVALUATION OF RESPON SE 
Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified timepoint, a response assessment occurs.   
Table  [ADDRESS_83974] non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table  2  is 
to be used.  
Table  1 Timepoint Response:  Patients with Target Lesions

a “Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for non -target 
disease since stable disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some studies; thus, assigning “stable disease” 
when no lesions can be measured is not advised.

Ipatasertib —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
135/Protocol CO39303, Version 8  Missing Assessments and Not -Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient i s not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual mis sing 
lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This would be most likely 
to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient had  a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_83975] achieved PD  status, regardless of the 
contribution of the missing lesion.  
If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done 
or the scan could not be assessed because  of poor image quality or obstructed view, the 
response for target lesions should be “unable to assess” since the patient is not 
evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more non -target lesions are not assessed, the response 
for non -target lesions should be “unabl e to assess” except where there is clear 
progression.  Overall response would be “unable to assess” if either the target response 
or the non -target response is “unable to assess,” except where this  is clear evidence of 
progression as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that timepoint.

a If a CR is truly met at the first timepoint, any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint, 
even  disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, qualifies as PD at that point 
(since  disease must have reappeared after CR).  Best response wo uld depend on 
whether the minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes CR may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in 
fact the patient had PR, not CR, at the first timepoint.  Under these circumstance s, the 
original CR should be changed to PR  and the best response is PR.   
Special Notes on Response Assessment  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size ( 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  
This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As  noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum  of “zero” on the CRF.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be  reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be ma de to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  
The objective response status of such patients is to be deter mined by [CONTACT_77058] -target disease as shown in  Table  1, Table  2, and

137/Protocol CO39303, Version 8  Table  3.  
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain  new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression wa s suspected.  
In studies for which patients with advanced disease are eligible (i.e.,  primary disease still 
or partially present), the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or non -target 
lesion, as appropriate.  This is to avoid an incorrect ass essment of complete response if 
the primary tumor is still present but not evaluated as a target or non -target lesion.

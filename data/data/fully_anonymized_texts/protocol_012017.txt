April [ADDRESS_723449] injury (SCI) is too often made in a vacuum of 
knowledge, with limited guidance from clinicians, and in many cases, in the face of bias and discrimination. 
Literature suggests that knowledge about S CI and pregnancy is poorly disseminated to women1 with many 
receiving inadequate information before becoming pregnant .[ADDRESS_723450] the efficacy and acceptability of a new preg nancy 
decision -making  tool designed for women with SCI to support the decision -making  proc ess.  
METHODS  
Sample Characteristics  – Women will have a traumatic or non -traumatic cause of SCI and at least 18 years old; 
aim-specific criteria are given below. Three items from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System16 will 
determine disability severity based on the need for assistance with daily life activities and/or personal care; women with mild, moderate or severe severity will be eligible. Women who are eligible will be actively planning or in the process of makin g a decision about whether or not to get pregnant in the near future. The language is 
deliberately open based on feedback from women during development. The decision -making process for many 
women with SCI can be protracted given many uncertainties and a ge neral lack of information and health care 
provider expertise.  
Description of the Decision Making Tool  – T
 he decision making tool is a web -based  site with a set of 9 
downloadable worksheets  (uploaded in Section 12, Exemption 3, #8  of the application) . We de veloped the tool 
through iterative brainstorming sessions with stakeholders and used  a survey , focus group , and interview data 
from women with SCI who have been pregnant, decided not to get pregnant, or are considering a future 
pregnancy. The tool  covers topi[INVESTIGATOR_232849] a pregnancy  and 
reflects core elements of decision making tools based on the Ottawa Framework for Decision Support .17 This 
framework targets determinants of decisions that may be potentially modifiable by a decision -making tool, but 
are currently suboptimal for patients and health care providers due to factors such as inadequate knowledge, 
high uncertainty, or biased per ceptions of others.   
• O verview of Pregnancy  – Reviews changes in a woman’s body during pregnancy. This  is not meant to be 
exhaustive but a general overview.  
 
Page 3 of 6 
 • Knowing what is important to you – Reflects Ottawa Framework’s values  component. Worksheet focuses on 
what is important to the woman as a foundation for decision making.  It has several options to answer 
questions about values and learn more about how other women with disabilities answered the same 
question (links out to a summary report).  
• P artners, family and important relationships  – Reflects Ottawa Framework’s support  component. G uides the 
woman in talking about her decision and engaging those most important to her. The worksheet support s 
conversations that can be challenging to have.   
• P hysical function and independence  – Reviews major domains of physical function and the possible effects 
of pregnancy on the woman’s independence. The worksheet highlights topic areas to discuss with different 
health care providers.  
• H ealth and wellbeing  – Provides an ove rview of the different medical specialties that might be involved in 
care during planning and during a pregnancy and reviews major areas of mental and physical health that could be affected during pregnancy. The worksheet presents a series of questions a woman can review with 
her family and health care providers.  
• C
aring for an infant  – Encourages women to consider various aspects of caring for an infant that may apply 
to them. The worksheet provides a list of considerations to support further dialog with he r family and health 
care providers.  
• S CI after pregnancy  – Addresses possible changes after pregnancy, such as regaining physical  fitness, to 
consi der in decision -making .  
• F inancial resources & insurance  – Addresses the need for financial planning in anticipation of a pregnancy 
and childcare . The worksheet reviews various aspects of planning a woman should consider as part of her 
decision making.   
• H ow to find reliable information and resources  – Provides guidance for how to find information and judge its 
quality. The worksheet provides a step by [CONTACT_550660].  
• C onnecting with other women with SCI – Gen eral guidance for connecting to their peers . 
• Dealing with reactions of others, stigma and bias, pressure  – Addresses the pressures women with 
disabilities can face during decision making about pregnancy.  
• R eaching a decision – A closing section that highli ghts  that it is OK to be wherever the woman is in the 
process, the different ways she may feel, and that it’s OK to take a break if needed.  
Intervention Delivery, Feasibility and Efficacy Testing  – W e will provide the tool for a [ADDRESS_723451] design was selected following the 
recommendations of O’Connor and Jacobsen18 for pi[INVESTIGATOR_232850] -making tools; this will help us 
prepare the tool for the next phase of testing that will utilize a parallel groups design. Similarly, th e sample size 
was based on feasibility at this stage of the tool’s development. We will assess outcomes at baseline, 6 weeks 
and the end of the trial period. For pi[INVESTIGATOR_232851]’s development, we are interested in 
several dimensions  of feasibility and preliminary support for its efficacy. Using Bowen et al.’s19 phases of 
intervention development, we are primarily  concern ed with assessing “can it work” .  Participants will be 
compensated $40 for their time.

 Recruitment  – Three methods will be utilized to recruit pi[INVESTIGATOR_798]: (1) study announcement published in 
our project newsletter requesting that interested  women contact [CONTACT_3019], (2) social media postings on our project 
webpage and with groups we have connected with in the past, and (3) study announcement posted on UM 
Health Research. It is possible that women who participated in the earlier development work for this project, 
under HUM00149452 , will choose to participate in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Data generated under HUM00149452  will 
not be linked to data from this study.  
Outcome Assessment  – I n pi[INVESTIGATOR_232852], we are interested in feasibility  and prelimina ry 
effectiveness. Specifically, we are interested in the tool’s acceptability, demand for it, and its implementation (or 
use of the tool). For preliminary efficacy , the goal for pi[INVESTIGATOR_550656] a woman to make a decision about 
pregnancy during the intervention period. Rather, assessment will focus on three domains of interest we expect to be influenced positively by [CONTACT_232861].  
We will also ask a sub -set of women if they would be i nterested in an opened ended interview to learn more 
about their experience using the tool and any other feedback they wish to share. This is not required and is not highly structured; it will be an informal conversation for those wishing to share more in depth feedback.  
• Decisional conflict is characterized by [CONTACT_232862] a decision . The Decisional Conflict Scale
[ADDRESS_723452] , the support subscale  for having the support of others,  and the 
values subscale  for clarity of values.  
• Decision or choice predisposition will be assessed using the single -item Stage of Decision- Making Scale.23 
The scale ranges from “haven’t begun to think about choices” to “have already made a decision and unlikely to change my mind” but are modified to fit pregnancy and excludes the option of not having begun to think 
about choices since we are only including women actively planning or considering a future pregnancy.  
Outcomes , measures, and time when collected are summarized in the table.  Outcome measure items are 
presented on pages 6 -8. All measures will be completed via online survey, or by [CONTACT_550661].

Screening, Demographic and Background Variables  – The list of screening, demographic and background 
variables are uploaded in the application, Section 12, Exemption 3, #8. These data will be collecte d at time of 
screening by [CONTACT_648]; demographic and background variables will be collected  post consent.  
Analy sis  – Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize single item Likert scales. To examine preliminary 
efficacy of the tool, statistical analysis will include within -subjects, repeated measures analytic approaches (i.e., 
linear mixed models) to test the direction and magnitude of change on efficacy outcomes. Models will include 
selected disability characteristics (e.g., congenital vs. acquired) to test if the tool performs similarly across 
disability types .

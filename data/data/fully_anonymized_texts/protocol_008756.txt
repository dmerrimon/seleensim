Context :  (Background)  
Behavioral sleep problems such as insomnia and insufficient sleep are common in toddlers 
and preschoolers and disproportionately impact lower socioeconomic status (SES) children. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a robust evidence base, behavioral sleep interventions are rarely tested with lower -
SES children or in primary care, an accessible service delivery setting.  
Objectives :  
The primary objective of this study is to  determine the whether the Sleep Well! behavioral  
sleep intervention is feasible and acceptable to families. We will also examine the direction 
and magnitude of change in child sleep from pre -intervention to post -intervention.  
Study Design :  
This is a prel iminary open trial of the Sleep Well! program with pre -intervention and post -
intervention assessments.  
Setting/Participants:  
Caregiver -child dyads (child ages 1-5 years with a sleep problem) will be recruited from 3 
CHOP urban primary care sites (South Phi ladelphia, Cobbs Creek, Karabots). A maximum 
of 20 caregiver -child dyads will participate in the intervention.  
Study Interventions and Measures :  
Sleep Well! is a brief, behavioral sleep intervention for toddlers and preschoolers who have 
a caregiv er-reported sleep problem or who are not getting enough sleep. The intervent ion 
includes evidence -based behavioral sleep approaches  and strategies to engage and empower 
families. The primary outcomes for this open trial are feasibility (number of caregiver s 
recruited, engaged, and retained in intervention ; participant intervention attendance rate ) and 
caregiver acceptability, assessed via a questionnaire and qualitative post -intervention 
interview. Secondary outcomes are the  direction and magnitude in any p re- to post -
intervention change in child sleep.

Sleep Well! , a behavioral sleep intervention for toddlers and preschoolers , is being  tested. 
The program includes standard behavioral sleep treatment approaches (caregiver education 
about healthy sleep habits; development of bedtime routine and sleep schedule; behavioral 
management of bedtime tantrums) with adaptations  (see 1.3, below)  for the target population 
(lower -SES caregivers) and context (pediatric primary care).  
1.[ADDRESS_5136] concurrent and subsequent neurobehavioral (inattention; poor response inhibition)2-4 
and social -emotional10-12 problems, which can impair school outcomes.13,14 
 
Behavioral sleep problems are more prevalent in lower -socioeconomic status (SES) 
children.6,8,15 Behavioral sleep pr oblems including pediatric insomnia (bedtime problems; 
night awakenings) and insufficient sleep are found in  20-30% of young children.16,17 Lower -
SES children show greater insomnia symptoms,7,15,18 shorter sleep duration, and worse sleep 
quality,3,6,8 even when controlling for other factors such as child race/ethnicity.7,18,[ADDRESS_5137] behavioral treatments for child sleep problems , studies rarely 
examine these treatments in lower -SES children with sleep problems .17,20,21 Brief 
interventions result in improvements in child sleep and behavior.22,23 Intervention content 
generally involves  caregiver education about child sleep needs and healthy habits and 
implementing behavioral interventions, such as a consistent bedtime routine and sleep 
schedule, parental limit -setting, and reducing caregiver presence in the child’s bedroom at 
bedtime.17,20,[ADDRESS_5138] 20 years, there has been a major emphasis on integr ating 
behavioral health services into primary practice.28 To be re sponsive to this important 
practice shift , which has incorporated behavioral health clinicians into primary care,  research 
is needed  to identify how evidence -based  interventions can be implemented in an 
integrated primary care context.37  
 
Adaptations to behavioral sleep intervention  are needed for effective implementation in 
urban primary care.  Previous research38 indicates a high need to adapt the content  and 
service delivery methods  of early childhood sleep interventions  for a lower -SES sample  and 
for implementation in the primary care context . Content adaptations  include developi[INVESTIGATOR_5764] -SES caregivers .39 Shift -
work  and single parenthood , which are both common in lower -SES families, are each linked 
to increased parenting stress ,40-43 which  can make intervention components such as consistent 
bedtime routines difficult to implement.7 Other intervention components,  such as reducing 
parent presence in the bedroom, may also need adaptation to accommodate socio -cultural 
variation in beliefs about sleep18,44 and increased bed- and room -sharing  in lower -SES 
families.45 Other modifications may be needed, such as tailoring parenting strategies for 
mothers with depressed mood , as previous studies15,46,47 show that caregiver depression and 
child sleep problems are significantly associated  across different levels of SES . 
 
Service delivery method adaptations  include enhanced  engagement , empowerment,  and 
retention strategies  may be needed, as attrition is common in lower -SES families facing 
multiple stressors (e.g., housing instability, childcare and transportation issues ).48-52 
Additionally, p retreatment motivational strategies53 to increase engagement may be needed. 
Supplemental methods  to provide content to families, such as via text messages, may also be 
appropriate. A trauma -informed approach  may also need to be integrated  due to high rates of 
violence exposure in lower -SES co ntexts .54-56  
 
1.4 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5765] 45 CFR 46  and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline 
approved by [CONTACT_5787] (ICH ). All epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s of 
noncompliance will be documented.  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance  with this protocol, will obtain consent 
and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others  in 
accordance with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5766] 
   
   [ADDRESS_5139] the preliminary feasibility  and acceptability of a behavioral 
sleep intervention for lower -SES toddlers and preschoolers that is implemented in primary 
care.  
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the whether the behavioral sleep 
intervention is  feasible and acceptable to families.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondary objectives are to:  
• Examine the magnitude and direction of change in child  sleep from pre - to post  
intervention.  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
This is a small open pi[INVESTIGATOR_5767]!, a behavioral sleep program for toddlers and 
preschoolers that will be implemented at 3 of the CHOP urban primary car e sites. Following 
referral, potentially eligible families will be screened by [CONTACT_5788]. 
Eligible and interested participants will be consented and scheduled for a pre -intervention 
(baseline) assessment occurring [ADDRESS_5140] -intervention (see Figure 1, above). 
Outcomes related to intervention feasibil ity and acceptability will be assessed throughout the 
duration of the study period (see Table 1, above). Caregiver participants will complete 
baseline demographic information and ratings of their child’s sleep. Actigraph devices to 
objectively measure slee p will also be offered as an optional assessment . At post -intervention, 
caregiver participants will also provide ratings of their child’s sleep and participate in a 
qualitative interview to provide intervention content and delivery feedback.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_5141],  providers (physicians, nurses, social workers, and psychologists) practicing at the South 
Philadelphia, Cobbs Creek, and Karabots primary care locations will identify potentially 
eligible families of young children with sleep problems for this study. The study team will 
also post a flyer for participants (see below  and uploaded recruitment document ) in providers’ 
office to remind them of the study and to encourage referrals.  This flyer will also be emailed 
to all of the providers. A smartphrase in Epic (s ee uploaded recruitment document) will be 
made available to providers practicing at these sites to facilitate recruitment and to provide 
   
   [ADDRESS_5142] sleep concerns and are potentially eligible will 
be asked if they would be  interested in participating in an intervention program to improve 
child sleep. The providers will then provide the child’s name [CONTACT_5819]/or 
medical record number (MRN) of interested families to the study team , or provide the 
smartp hrase to families in the After Visit Summary.  
Second, the study team will also identify possible participants by [CONTACT_5789]’ 
schedules prior to the date of the visit for basic eligibility criteria, and will contact [CONTACT_5790].  
Third, the study team will also use printed flyers and tear pads, which will be posted in the 
providers’ waiting rooms, will be handed out to families, and will be displayed for potential 
families to take.  
Fourth,  we have r equested approval to  use data collected as part of IRB 18-[ADDRESS_5143] these potentially eligible 
participants for recruitment in the current study by [CONTACT_5791] t he screening procedure 
and methods identified below.  
Fifth, the Recruitment Enhancement Core (REC) will provide in assistance with recruitment 
plan development and may assist in identifying and contact[CONTACT_5792], the CHOP Recr uitment Registry, social media and internal communication resources. 
Please see the REC e -mail uploaded with this protocol for further information. The REC also 
engages community partners and facilitates outreach on behalf of the research Institute and 
CHO P research studies . Any recruitment materia ls distributed by [CONTACT_5793], such as tear pads  and 
recruitment flyers, will first be submitted to the IRB for review and approval prior to use.  Of 
note, we have included the REC e -mail, tear pads, and recruitment flyers  with this submission. 
Any additional recruitment materials, such as social media posts, will be submitted to the IRB 
for review prior to any use of these materials.  
For these methods we are requesting a waiver  of HIPAA authorization to screen medical 
records in the EHR  to ensure that families that are contact[CONTACT_5794]’s medical record.  
For potentially eligible families, the study team will contact [CONTACT_5795], for 
interested fa milies,  screen them for the stud y using inclusion/exclusion criteria and an 
associated eligibility screening survey, and schedule eligible and interested families for 
informed consent procedures . The study team is also requesting a n alteration of 
documenta tion of HIPAA authorization to screen given that the study team is located in 
the Roberts building and will not have in -person contact [CONTACT_5796].  It would therefore not be feasible to obtain written documentation of HIPAA 
authorization for screening from these families. In addition, this method will reduce any 
burden to participants in traveling to complete in -person eligibility screening.  
   
   5 
The phone screening will include  requesting that parents /legal guardians  respond to q uestions 
to determine whether exclusion criteria are present. If families are eligible, they will be 
scheduled for a study visit at their child’s CHOP primary care practice to obtain written 
consent  for the main study  and collect baseline data. If families  are unable to meet in -person 
for baseline procedures, they will be provided the option to complete electronic informed 
consent procedures via REDCap  (see below). During the screening phone call , families will 
be informed of their choice to participate or not. If families decide not to participate, they will 
be referred to the CHOP Sleep Center, consistent with the current standard of care for 
behavioral sleep problems.  
Given that the CHOP urban primary care sites see approximately 49,600 children per year,  
we believe that we will be able to recruit a sufficient number of participants to meet the goals 
for this objective. In addition, this recruitment strategy has been discussed with the primary 
care sites for this study, and has been approved by [CONTACT_5797].  
3.1.2 Study Intervention Phase  
Sleep Well! is a brief, behavioral sleep intervention. The intervention was originally 
comprised of healthy sleep advice and tested in the context of a sleep health education 
campaign for impoverished children .[ADDRESS_5144] expanded the intervention to more 
comprehensively  address poor sleep health behavi ors (e.g., use of electronics at bedtime; 
inconsistent and variable sleep schedules; lack of a bedtime routine)  as well as  insomnia 
(difficulty falling and staying asleep; the need for caregiver presence at bedtime) and 
insufficient sleep in toddlers and p reschoolers who are living in disadvantaged contexts. 
Intervention components are based on effective pediatric behavioral sleep treatments .21,22,24,[ADDRESS_5145] been made based on preliminary results 
from our previous study (IRB 18 -015041) with primary care providers in the target urban 
primary care context and caregivers of young children with sleep problems who are reflective 
of the target intervention population . For example, interventionists will use strategies to 
engage with and empower families, such as motivational interviewing and collaborative 
problem -solving.53 In-person session content will be reinforced via phone calls from 
interventionists. We will also send families intervention session appointment reminders and 
information about intervention content (e.g., reminde rs to follow a bedtime routine), using 
Twilio, which is integrated with REDCap . No PHI will be transmitted via text message, and 
families will be asked to contact [CONTACT_5798]. Consistent with 
standards of clinical care for behavioral health services in the CHOP primary care network, 
sessions will be scheduled in the electronic health record, with progress notes for in -person 
visits and in tervention -related phone calls also documented in the electronic health record.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_5146] with the Sleep Well! interventionist. The 
follow -up assessment will include caregiver -complete questionnaires and a brief qualitative 
interview. The follow -up assessment will be conducted by a research team member . 
   
   6 
3.2 Allocation to Intervention  Groups and Blinding  
All participants will be allocated to the intervention condition, as this is a non -randomized, 
open trial. Blinding is not applicable.  
3.3 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
3.3.1 Duration of Study Participation  
The study duration pe r participant will be up to 3 months, to accommodate families needing 
to reschedule any assessments or intervention sessions. After screening and, for eligible 
families, enrollment, a baseline assessment will occur within 3 weeks. The enrolled family 
will then participate in the Sleep Well! intervention over the course of 4 -7 weeks. The 
follow -up assessment will occur 1 -2 weeks after the end of the intervention phase.   
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
This study will be conduc ted at the 3 CHOP -affiliated urban primary care sites in 
Pennsylvania (South Philadelp hia, Cobbs Creek, and Karabots).  
It is expected that 80 caregiver -child dyads (total screening N = 160) will be screened to 
meet the recruitment goal of enrolling 30 care giver -child dyads (total enrollment N = 60). 
Based on our previous research with the target population (IRB 18 -015041) and intervention 
attrition rates (20 -30%) in similar urban primary care contexts,58 it is expected that of tho se 
80 caregiver -child dyads screened, 30 will be enrolled in the main study to produce 20 
evaluable caregiver -child dyads (total evaluable N = 40).  
3.4 Study Population  
3.4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1) Parental/guardian permission (informed consent)  
2) Caregiver participant is  the parent or legal guardian of the child subject  
3) Caregiver/legal guardian 18 years of age .

5) Presence of caregiver -reported child sleep problem determined by a Brief Child Sleep 
Questionnaire  item59,60 included in an eligibility screening questionnaire (see below ) or 
child meets American Academy of Sleep Medicine51 diagnostic criteria for either pediatric 
insomnia or insufficient sleep, assessed through an eligibility screening questionnaire.  
6) English -speaking.  
 
3.4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1) Caregiver is not parent or legal guardian of child participant.  
2) Presence of a diagnosed child neurodevelopmental (e.g., autism spectrum disorder; 
Trisomy 21) or c hronic medical condition (e.g., sickle cell disease, cancer)  in which the 
disorder or treatment of the disorder impact sleep.   
3) Caregivers/guardians or subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may be non -
compliant with study schedules or procedures . 
 
   
   [ADDRESS_5147] be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.  
4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Screening Phase  
Procedures for screening referred and poten tially eligible participants are described in detail 
above (section 3.1.1). The screening phase will be completed by a study team member and 
will include:  
• EMR review by a study team member after potential participant referral  
• Phone screening using eligibil ity screening questionnaire (section 5.1.2), after 
completing verbal HIPAA authorization  
• Scheduling of informed consent and baseline assessment (completed in person or 
electronically)  
4.2 Baseline Assessment  (Pre-Intervention)  
The baseline assessment will be c onducted by a study team member and will be completed 
in person or electronically. It will include:  
• Informed consent  
• Abstraction of child demographic information  
• Caregiver completion of caregiver demographic and family information 
questionnaire,  previous t reatment questionnaire, and Brief Child Sleep Questionnair e 
• 7-day daily sleep diary questionnaire via text messages delivered via REDCap and 
its integration with Twilio  
• Actigraphy for families who are able to  conduct the baseline assessment in person 
(optional)   
If a caregiver has difficulty completing measures independently, a research assistant will 
read the items and provide assistance as needed. If a caregiver is unable or unwilling to 
receive the 7 -day di ary via text messages, we will offer to (a) e -mail the daily diary to the 
caregiver for 7 days or (b) have a research assistant call the caregiver by [CONTACT_5799] 7 days, with the research assistant entering caregiver re sponses 
into a REDCap database.  
4.3 Study Treatment Phase  
Sleep Well!  will be provided over approximately [ADDRESS_5148] about an hour, but session length may vary. Content  
is delivered in a modular format based on family goals and the child’s sleep concern (e.g., 
using electronics before bedtime; an inconsistent bedtime routine; etc.). To ensure high -
quality care, intervention providers  will receive regular supervision . Providers will also 
contact [CONTACT_5800]  (a) promote attendance , engagement,53 and implementation of 
Sleep Well! strategies , (b) assist in resolving barriers to treatment, and (c) guide families to 
community resources as needed.  As noted above (3.1.2), text messages about the intervention 
   
   [ADDRESS_5149] will also document any feedback regarding the intervention as a method to 
assess intervention feasibility  and usability .  
4.3.1 Procedures for training Sleep Well! interventionists  
The initial Sleep Well!  provider  for th e first [ADDRESS_5150]. 
Williamson’s ment or, [CONTACT_5821], Associate Director of the CHOP Sleep Center and 
Diplomat in Behavioral Sleep Medicine. Other study interventionists will be advanced 
clinical, counseling, school psychology or social work graduate students.  [CONTACT_5822] will 
provid e each interventionist with  approximately [ADDRESS_5151]. Williamson will provide the interventionists with weekly supervision based on 
review of audio -recorded intervention sessions.  
4.4 Follow -up Phase (Post -Intervention)  
The follow -up assessment will be conducted by a study team member and wil l be completed 
in person or electronically  (questionnaires) and via telephone (interview) . It will include:  
• Caregiver completion of Treatment Evaluation Inventory -Short Form, Brief Child 
Sleep Questionnaire  
• Caregiver completion of Multicultural Therapy Competency Inventory - Client 
Version (MTCI -CV)  
• 7-day daily sleep diary questionnaire  via text messages delivered via REDCap and 
its integration with Twilio  
• Audio -recorded caregiver interview on intervention co ntent and acceptability  
• Actigraphy for families who completed actigraphy assessment at baseline  
If a caregiver has difficulty completing measures independently, a research assistant will 
read the items and provide assistance as needed.  If a caregiver is un able or unwilling to 
receive the 7 -day diary via text messages, we will offer to (a) e -mail the daily diary to the 
caregiver for 7 days or (b) have a research assistant call the caregiver by [CONTACT_5799] [ADDRESS_5152] may occur 
with some participants  (e.g., concern related to participant safety report ed by [CONTACT_5801]; issue with actigraph) . 
Participant safety concern. Please see sections [ADDRESS_5153] Completion/Withdrawal  
Caregiver -child dyads  may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their 
care, education or employment.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion 
of the i nvestigators for lack of adherence to the study and/or the emergence of exclusionary 
criteria. Children  will be withdrawn from the study if any exclusionary criteria emerge during 
the study. Child  well-being will be monitored by [CONTACT_5802]. If any adverse events occur that require clinical intervention during the 
course of study participation, a PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator who is a licensed clinician will  conduct 
a risk and safety assessment and make clinically appropriate ref errals . If the investigators 
become aware of any serious, related adverse events after a participant completes or

5.1.2 Eligibility Screening Q uestionnaire  
Caregivers will be asked questions to identify whether dyads are eligibility for the study. 
These questions are related to child medical or neurodevelopmental conditions, medications, 
and the presence of child sleep problems.  
5.2 Measures of Treatment Feasibility and Acceptability (Primary Outcomes)  
• Screening rate (feasibility):  The study team will track the number of potentially 
eligible participants screened of those referred per month.  
• Recruitment rate (feasibility):  The study t eam will track the number of potentially 
eligible participants enrolled of those screened per month.  
• Retention rate (feasibility):  The study team will track the number of caregiver -child 
dyad participants who complete all study procedures following enrollm ent. 
• Assessment process (feasibility):  The study team will track the number of proportion 
of participants who complete all assessments (pre -intervention and post -intervention) 
that were planned.  
• Intervention usability (feasibility):  Study interventionists will keep records of 
barriers to and facilitators of the intervention content and procedures.  
• Family engagement and adherence (feasibility):  Study interventionists will keep 
records of family intervention attendance, including the number of sessions that t he 
family attended, rescheduled, and no -showed, and the number of phone calls that 
families completed. Study interventionists will also keep records of families’ usage 
of intervention strategies, based on feedback from families in -session.  
• Intervention fid elity (feasibility):  Intervention fidelity , or the extent to which the 
intervention is delivered as intended, will be assessed using the following two 
methods.  
1. Intervention sessions will be audio -recorded and coded by a study team 
member. This information will be provided to the PI/interventionist 
supervisor, [CONTACT_5823], who will use the information in her 
supervision of study interventionists. Telephone contact [CONTACT_5804].  
   
   11 
2. Interventionists will comp lete fidelity checklists61 that include items 
corresponding to the core components of Sleep Well! and to process items, 
including establishing trust, listening attentively, and re -directing tangential 
comments.  
• Treatment acceptability:   Treatment acceptability will be assessed using the 
following two methods.  
1.  Caregivers will complete the Treatment Evaluation Inventory —Short 
Form,62 a widely used measure of treatment acceptability that has been 
adapted for the purposes of the Sleep Well! intervention.  
2. Caregivers will complete the Multicultural Therapy Competency Inventory - 
Client Version (MTCI -CV)63 to assess patient’s  perceptions of the Sleep 
Well! therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s cultural sensitivity durin g discussions about safe sleep.  
3. Caregivers will complete an audio -recorded, open -ended qualitative 
interview (15 -20 minutes) with questions related to aspects of the 
intervention that were helpful/unhelpful, how the intervention could be 
improved, and the acceptability of the measurement process  (see interview 
guide uploaded with study measures) . 
5.3 Demographic and Child Sleep Measures  (Secondary Outcomes)  
• Child Demographic Information: Child demographic information will be abstracted 
from the EMR (see section  5.1.1).  
• Caregiver D emographic  and Family  Questionnaire: Caregivers will complete a 
caregiver and family demographic questionnaire  at baseline . Child data will include 
CHOP primary care site where child receives care , whether the child attends 
daycare/pres chool, and where the child typi[INVESTIGATOR_5769] . Caregiver/family data will 
include age, sex, race, ethnicity, highest educational level obtained, relationship to 
child, income, employment status, relationship  status, number of times the family has 
moved in the last year, and information about children and adults living in the home.  
• Previous Service Use Form: At baseline, caregivers will complete a form related to 
any previous treatment for child sleep or beha vior problems.  
• Brief Child Sleep Questionnaire (BCSQ): Caregivers will complete the BCSQ59,60 to 
report on child sleep habits (sleep time, total sleep durations, night wakings, aspects 
of the sle ep environment, etc.) and the severity of any caregiver -perceived sleep 
problems. The BCSQ is appropriate for children ages 1-5 years and has shown good 
reliability and moderate correspondence with actigra phic recordings of child -sleep .60  
• 7-Day Daily Child Sleep Diary: Items drawn from the BCSQ will be used to track 
regularity in child bedtime routines, bedtime activities, and 24 -hour sleep schedule 
over 7 days  at baseline (pre -intervention) and follow -up (post -intervention).  
• Actigraphy: Objective child sleep  will be assessed using a Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Inc., 
Actiwatch Spectrum ,63 which is a water -resistant accelerometer devic e. Consistent 
with guidelines for the reliable and valid use of actigraph devices in children ,64 
caregivers will be instructed to keep the actigraph on their child’s wrist  continuously 
for the 7-day period at baseli ne and the [ADDRESS_5156] 5 days of data (to account for 2 days 
of missing data) are obtained .64 Caregivers will be asked to press an event marker at 
lights -off and lights -on. Actigraph data show an 85.1 -88.6% agreement with 
   
   [ADDRESS_5157] for objectively assessing sleep .64 
Actigra ph data will be analyzed using Philips Actiwatch software and scored using 
guidelines for young children .64 Actigraphs will generate daily total estimates of 
child sleep onset, offset, and sleep time variability.  
5.4 Safety Evaluation  
Participant safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_5805]. Please see the 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (section 8.4.1) for further information.   
6  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 Primary Endpoint s 
The primary endpoints are ov erall ratings of intervention feasibility and acceptability for 
specific outcomes.  
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include the magnitude and direction of change in child sleep.  
6.3 Control of Bias and Confounding  
As a convenience sample, our participa nts may differ in important ways from those who 
choose not to participate in the study, which will limit the generalizability of our findings. 
We will mention this as a limitation of our study in any publications. In addition, in order to 
ensure that the s ubjects recruited from the study sites are representative of primary care 
patients presenting to these sites, we will monitor the demographics of our samples from 
each site to the CHOP Pediatric Research Consortium data on the demographics of patients 
at each site and to the demographics of primary care providers .  Finally, although we will 
attempt to recruit subjects evenly throughout the study period, recruitment during different 
times of the year (i.e., various seasons) could potentially impact child sle ep. We will note 
this as a limitation in any study publications.  
6.4 Statistical Methods  
I will examine the following quantitative feasibility and acceptability outcomes  through the 
use of descriptive statistics, which include means for continuous variables a nd proportions for 
categorical variables.  
• Screening (number of caregiver -child dyads referred and screened/month)  
• Recruitment (number of caregiver -child dyads enrolled/month)  
• Retention (number of dyads who complete intervention condition of those enrolled ) 
• Intervention usability (interventionist -rated perceptions of intervention manual and 
strategies)  
• Family engagement (number of intervention sessions/phone calls completed)  
• Intervention adherence (interventionist -rated checklist)  
• Intervention fidelity (a: interventionist self -reported checklist; b: coding of the 
implementation of audio -recorded intervention sessions)  
• Intervention acceptability (caregiver -rated TEI -SF and MTCI -CV) 
   
   13 
• Assessment process (number of planned assessments that are completed)  
 
I will examine the following quantitative child sleep -related outcomes  drawn from the 
caregiver -rated BCSQ and, for families that have it, actigraphy, through descriptive statistics 
(means; proportions). I will also estimate within -group effect  sizes (Cohen’s d) with 95% 
confidence intervals. Effect sizes will be estimated as the ratio of the mean within -person 
change scores (post -treatment minus pre -treatment) to the standard deviation of change scores. 
Cohen’s d values will be examined to iden tify the direction and magnitude of effects.  
• BCSQ:  
o Child total (24 -hour) sleep duration  
o Child sleep onset latency  
o Child night awakenings  
o Child bedtime resistance  
o Child sleep problems  
 
• Actigraphy (for families who have opted to complete it)  
o Sleep onset and offset  
o Sleep time regularity  
 
Interview data analysis  will utilize an integrated approach ,65 with both a priori codes and 
grounded theory codes that emerge from the data . We will use QSR NVivo© software for 
interview data analysis. The study team will create a codebook from the first three transcripts. 
After establishing a stable codebook, all transcripts will be coded. Every fifth transcript will 
be double coded to generate an interrater relia bility (Kappa) index. Coding disagreements will 
be resolved through discussion. We will examine each code to identify patterns in the data 
and key themes.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_5158] the efficacy or 
significance of intervention effects. A power analysis was thus not appropriate. The sample 
size for this study was identified through a review of the literature on the testing of preliminary 
behavioral intervention development/adaptation66-68 and through discussion with my mentors  
and co -investigators Drs. Alexander Fiks, Jodi Mindell, and Thomas Power.   
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 4 08: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
   
   14 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review . 
8 STUDY ADMIN ISTRATION  
8.1 Treatment Assignment Methods  
Randomization and blinding procedures are not applicable for this non -randomized, open 
trial. 
8.2 Data Collection and Management  
The data collection and management plan described below is  consistent with CHOP Policy 
A-3-9: Acceptable Use of Technology Resources that defines the requirements for 
encryption and security of computer systems.  
Confidentiality: A separate, password -protected REDCap database will be used  as a master 
list linking PHI and study ID number s. This  master list will contain the child  name, MRN , 
and the contact [CONTACT_5806]  (caregiver name, family address, phone number, 
e-mail addresses) for communicating with participants . This master list database will be 
accessible only to members of the study team. All paper consent forms will be stored 
separately, in locked filing cabinets in the Roberts Center for Pediatric Research . Any 
electronic ally completed consent forms will be entered by [CONTACT_5807] a separ ate, 
password -protected REDCap database with consent documents only identified by [CONTACT_5808]. These electronic consent forms will be printed out from REDCap and 
stored with paper consent forms in the same locked filing cabinets in the Robert s Center for 
Pediatric Research.  
Participants will complete study questionnaires  by [CONTACT_5809] s. Daily sleep diary information will be administered to 
participants via Twilio and its integration with  REDCap. The REDCap databases are 
password -protected , accessible only to members of the study team , and only contain  subject 
ID numbers and questionnaire responses.  
Actigraphy  data will be identified via unique participant ID. These coded data will be stor ed 
in a password -protected CHOP network drive accessible only to study team members for 
actigraphy analysis. Once data have been downloaded from the actigraph device, data on the 
actigraph will be destroyed.  
Intervention sessions  will be audio -recorded in person for fidelity purposes. For the 
qualitative  post-intervention  interview , participants’ responses will be audio -recorded in 
person or by [CONTACT_756]. All audio files will also be password -protected and temporarily 
saved on the  secure CHOP computer network drive. Transfer of audio files from the audio 
device to the secure CHOP computer network drive will occur via a flash drive that is 
encrypted and password -protected per CHOP IT standards. Once the audio file is transferred 
from the audio -recording device, it will be deleted from the flash drive and from the audio -
recording device. In the drive on the password -protected computer, audio files will be 
labeled according to participants’ unique study ID numbers, and no identifying i nformation 
   
   15 
will be used to label the files. Audio files of the intervention sessions will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_5810]. Audio files of the interviews will also be 
transcribed and checked for accuracy. All audio files will be  retained for a minimum of 6 
years, consistent with CHOP Data Retention Policy A -3-9, after which point they will be 
destroyed. Audio recordings may be sent to an outside professional transcription agency, 
ACTS Document Management located in South Point, O hio. All files are securely stored, 
transmitted, and encrypted. The agency will remove all identifying information from the 
transcripts and destroy their copy of the audio files after transcription is complete. 
Transcribed interview data will be coded usin g participants’ unique study ID numbers. Any 
interviewer field notes taken during the interview will be coded using only the participants’ 
unique study ID numbers, and stored in a locked filing cabinet in the Roberts Center for 
Pediatric Research  until the  point of transcription.  Interviewer field notes will then be 
destroyed. The transcribed interview and interviewer field note data will be stored in the 
secure and password -protected CHOP network drive .  
Security:  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_5771] (i.e., with part icipa nt unique study ID, demographic 
information , questionnaire responses , the transcribed interview and interviewer field note 
data) will be downloaded from REDCap for data analysis purposes. These data will be 
stored on the secure CHOP network drive . No identifying data from the separate, password -
protected REDCap dataset that contains the master list linking the participants’ identifying 
information and their  unique study ID number will be downloaded, and the database will 
only be accessible on the secur e, password -protected REDCap server.  As noted above, for 
audio files, transfer of files from the audio device to the password -protected computer will 
occur via an encrypted and password -protected CHOP flash drive, consistent with CHOP IT 
security procedure s. Uploads of audio files to the ACTS Document Management site for 
transcription purposes will also be encrypted.  ACTS Document Management has been 
vetted by [CONTACT_5811].  
Anonymization:  All identifiers that are stored in the separate, password protected REDCap 
database master list and the separate, password protected REDCap electronic consent 
database will be retained for [ADDRESS_5159] obtaining IRB approval. The 
investigator will obtain a data use agreement betwee n the provider (the PI) of the data and 
any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset ( PHI 
limited to dates and zip codes).  
   
   [ADDRESS_5160] by [CONTACT_5812]. In additio n, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5773] -Investigators are licensed 
pediatric providers who are experienced in talking with individuals  who are under stress due 
to mood concerns, child behavior concerns, or contextual issues (e.g., poverty, housing 
instability , work -related s tress). In addition, we will work closely with the CHOP Office of 
Research Compliance to insure data collection integrity, the privacy of data, and participant 
safety, and to monitor procedural compliance.  We will inform the IRB of serious adverse 
events  (SAEs)  in a timely manner. Other adverse events  (AEs)  will be reported annually.  
Additionally, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) , comprised of a pediatric sleep 
provider, a pediatric psychologist, and a pediatric primary care provider who work inte rnally 
at CHOP , will be appointed at the outset of this study, and this board will meet every [ADDRESS_5161] with 
the study team and are not involved in any study procedures.  
8.4.2 Risk Assessment  
Risks of participati ng in this study are not greater than minimal. There are no known 
physical or legal risks to participating in the study intervention. Potential risks are as 
follows:  
Families who are able to  conduct the baseline assessment in person may choose to participate 
in an  Actigraphy assessment. Ther e are no risks with wearing an A ctigraph, which is the size 
and shape of a small wristwatch , though s ome participants may consider it a minor 
inconvenienc e. 
Families may experience continued child sleep problems following the intervention phase. 
If families report continued child sleep concerns at post -intervention w e will offer families a 
referral to the CHOP Sleep Center, which is the current standard of care for managing child 
sleep problems . 
Although we are not asking caregivers to report on any instances of child abuse or neglect , 
should a caregiver or child spontaneously disclose this information to us during the study 
procedures or intervention phase,  we will file a Department of Human Services report in this 
regard. Based on standard behavioral health practices within the CHOP system, these 
procedures are likely to be effective in the case that additional behavioral health treatment 
and/or risk assess ment are necessary.  
   
   [ADDRESS_5162] on their experience (i.e., ‘debrief’) after they have completed t he study 
procedures/intervention. In the rare  event t hat a participant necessitates psychological 
treatment due to adverse effects of study participation , or a caregiver spontaneously 
discloses low mood or other psychological concerns, the study team member  will contact 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5774], and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5775], provide behavioral health 
resources, and screen for  any suicide/homicide risk  in a manner consistent with routine 
behavioral health  practice  at CHOP . Resources to mitigate risk (crisis numbers; referral 
resources) will be provi ded to participants verbally.  
All information obtained during any of the risk assessment procedures  described above will 
be used only for the purposes of determining appropriate follow -up care. Information about 
mandated child abuse reporting or concerns f or the child’s safety will be documented in the  
child's medical record, and will not be stored with study data, or used for any study -related 
data analysis.  It will not be stated in the medical record documentation that the child or 
caregiver are participa ting in a research study. For any caregiver -related risks (i.e., caregiver 
homicidal or suicidal risk), risk assessment information will be documented in a Note to File 
coded by [CONTACT_5813] a 
separate REDCap database used for tracking purposes only.  
There is also the risk related to the potential loss of confidentiality .  All reasonable 
safeguards to secure the confidentiality of data will be taken by [CONTACT_3476] (section 8.2).  
The risk o f breach of privacy and confidentiality are greatly reduced by [CONTACT_5814] -
protected REDCap databases, storing data on secure CHOP computers and servers, and de -
identification of data when applicable.   
Additionally, a Certificate of Confidentiality (Co C) will be obtained to protect identifiable 
research information from forced disclosure. The CoC will allow all individuals who have 
access to research records to refuse to disclose identifying information on research participants 
in any civil, criminal, a dministrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, 
state, or local level. By [CONTACT_5815], the CoC will help achieve the 
research objectives and promote participation in the study by [CONTACT_5816].  
 
8.4.3 Potential Benefits of Trial Participation  
Families in this study may learn information to manage their child’s sleep problems. 
Knowledge gaine d from this study will inform a larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_5776]! intervention. It is possible that families will not derive any direct benefits from study 
participation.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_5163] of care in the community (i.e., referral to the CHOP Sleep Center ). 
   
   18 
8.5 Recruitment Strategy  
Potential participants will be recruited for study eligibility screening through multiple 
methods, including provider referral, review of well child visit schedules and related EMR 
data, study flyers and tear pads, recruitment emails to providers and via the REC, and 
participant information from a previous study ( IRB 18-015041 ). Please see the detailed plan 
for study recruitment and screening described above in section  3.1.1. for further information.  
8.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
8.6.[ADDRESS_5164] l to the 
primary care sites or the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5777].  
8.6.3 Combined Informed Consent -Authorization of HIPAA for Study Procedures  
Members of the study team will be responsible for  obtaining informed consent for study 
procedures for all participants. For eligible families, informed consent using a combined 
consent -HIPAA authorization  will occur either in person or  electronically, via a secure 
REDCap  portal, pending caregiver preferences and availability.  Informed consent will be 
obtained from the child participant’s legal guardian . For families who agree to meet with the 
study team to perform the consent process in person, this meeting will take plac e in the waiting 
room of the primary care sites  or at the CHOP Main Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , in spaces that are semi -private 
and far enough away from other patients in order to maintain privacy. If the waiting room at 
the primary care site is too crowded to maintain pati ent privacy , we will request to use a 
private room at each primary care site for the consent process. If informed consent is obtained 
electronically, the participant will receive a link to the secure REDCap portal in which they 
will be asked to enter their  name , their child’s name,  and the date to indicate their consent. 
The provision of the caregiver’s and child’s name [CONTACT_5820]. The REDCap portal will contain the exact same information in the 
same fo rmat as the paper consent copy . The study team will email a copy of the completed 
electronic consent form to the family, with the instruction to either save or print a copy of this 
form. See section 8.[ADDRESS_5165] any future medical care . Families will be asked to explain 
back to the investigato rs the nature of the study, study procedures, and risk and benefits of 
participants to assure their understanding. A copy of the completed consent form will be 
provided to participants for their records. For families completing the consent process 
electron ically, we will print a copy of the completed consent from the secure REDCap portal 
and provide this to the family.  
8.6.4 Waiver  of Assent  
A waiver of child assent  is requested as all child participants will be between the ages of 
1 and 5 years. The capacity of children in this age group is so limited that they cannot 
reasonably be consulted about their assent and study participation.  
8.7 Payment to Subjects/Families  
8.7.1 Payments to caregivers for time, effort and inconvenience  (i.e. compensation ) 
The compensation for study participation will be provided to caregivers of the participating 
child as described below. All payment will be provided either in cash or by [CONTACT_5817] (for 
those completing assessments electronically, without an in -person visit).   
• $20.00 (for those completing surveys electronically) for questionnaire completion at 
the baseline  assessment.  
• $1.00 for each day that the caregiver completes the daily sleep diary over the 7 -day 
baseline  measurement period (7 days x $1.00 = $7.00 total)  
• For those participating in actigraphy: $2.00 for each day that the child wears the 
actigraph over the 7 -day baseline  measurement period (7 days x $2.00 = $14.00 
total)  
• $5.00 for having complete data (i.e., all measurement occasions complete, either 
diary o nly or diary + actigraphy) over the 7 -day daily baseline measurement period.  
• $30.00 for questionnaire and interview completion at follow -up (post -intervention).  
• $1.00 for each day that the caregiver completes the daily sleep diary over the 7 -day 
follow -up measurement period (7 days x $1.00 = $7.00 total)  
• For those participating in actigraphy: $2.00 for each day that the child wears the 
actigraph over the 7 -day follow -up measurement period (7 days x $2.00 = $14.00 
total)  
• $5.00 for having complete data (i.e., all measurement occasions complete, either 
diary only or diary + actigraphy) over the 7 -day daily follow -up measurement period.  
For the daily measures, providing subj ects with daily incentives and additional 
compensation for complete data has been shown to increase measure adherence to ≥ 94%.69 
The total possible payment for adherence to all measurement strategies (actigraphy 
included) is $102.00.

8.7.2 Gifts  
During Sleep Well! intervention participation, families may be provided with small stuffed 
animals or age -appropria te books to keep and use during their child’s bedtime routine.

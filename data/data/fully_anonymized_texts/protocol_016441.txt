Protocol Title  A Phase 2a Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and 
Efficacy of CAD-1883 Oral Treatment in Adults with Essential Tremor 
(CADENCE -1) 
Study Phase  2a 
Study Rationale  CAD -[ADDRESS_444046] being developed as a new treatment 
for Essential Tremor (ET), a movement disorder characterized by [CONTACT_356376] ( Haubenberger 
et al, 2018 ). Tremor is defined as a rhythmic and oscil latory movement of a 
body part with a relatively constant frequency and variable amplitude. It is 
caused by [CONTACT_356377]. Tremor is the 
most common of all movement disorders, and ET is the most common neurologic cause of tremor. The usual course of ET is one of gradual 
progression. Patients with persistent disability from ET need continuous 
symptomatic drug therapy. Available drug treatments  are not effective in all 
patients,  often  provide inadequate symptomatic relief, and the symptomatic 
benefit of chronic administration often declines over time and is frequently associated with intolerable side effects. Therapy options for ET patients who 
do not benefit from pharmacologic treatment include deep brain stimulation 
(DBS)  requiring surgery for placement of brain stimulator(s), magnetic 
resonance image (MRI) -guided thalamotomy via focused ultrasound (to treat 
persistently disabling unilateral  limb tremor), or botulinum toxin injections 
(to treat persistently disabling hand, head, or vocal cord tremor). The efficacy 
of these invasive, non -pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_356363], and 
may be associated with intolerable side effects.  Therefore, to address these 
important unmet medical needs, efforts are required to develop  new 
treatments for ET targeting the cerebellar dysregulation responsible for the 
movement disorder. 
The cerebellum is required for  coordinated motion, including movements of 
the hands, limbs, trunk, and eyes, and the synchrony of speech, all of which 
are disrupted in ET. The cerebellar cortex, together with the inferior olivary 
nucleus and deep cerebellar nuclei, comprise s the olivoc erebellar circuit. 
Cerebellar output critically depends on the precise timing of action potentials in the principal neurons of the olivocerebellar circuit, especially cerebellar 
Purkinje neur ons ( Llinas, 2014).  
Small conducta nce calcium -activated potassium (SK) channels are a family 
of potassium channels gated by [CONTACT_356378]  (Kshatri, 2018
). In 
neurons, SK channels are g ated by [CONTACT_356379] -gated 
calcium channels , which are activated by [CONTACT_356380]. SK channels

Version Amendment 3.0,  09 July  2019 5 regulate action potential timing  by [CONTACT_356381]. In principle neurons of the olivocerebell ar 
circuit, including cerebellar Purkinje neurons and their major afferent 
neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus , SK2 and SK3 channel -mediated after-
hyperpolarizing currents represent a molecular pace- making mechanism 
centrally implicated in the coordination of movement. 
CAD -1883 is a small molecule positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of SK 
channels 
CAD-[ADDRESS_444047] selective SK channel PAM 
candidate suit able for entering clinical development in patients with ET.  
CAD -1883 is anticipated to be used for the treatment of ET throughout the 
course of the patient’s disease. This study offers the opportunity to 
understand the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CAD -[ADDRESS_444048] participation could be up to 56 days.

, to allow the effects of previous 
medication( s)  to be eliminated. During the S creening period, each 
subject will undergo full assessment including medical and treatment history 
for ET , physical and neurological examination, in addition to laboratory 
testing, 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and other screening assessments. 
The diagnosis of ET must be established by [CONTACT_356382] (MDS)  criteria  (Bhatia, 2018 ) with 
a documented severity of tremor based on the clinician -administered 
TETRAS -PS (Elble, 2012 ). 
Per the Investigat
or’s discretion, re- testing of any laboratory abnormality at 
the central lab or at a local lab is permissible, with prior approval from the 
Medical Monitor.  
Subjects who previously fail ed screening can be invited to rescreen  up to two 
additional times , with recommendation by [CONTACT_356383].  
The study will be open  label consisting of [ADDRESS_444050] on reducing 
the magnitude and severity of tremor while limiting the potential risk associated with a novel investigational drug.  
Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study duration 
including in- clinic assessments of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse 
events (SAEs), vital signs including orthostatic vital signs, 12-lead ECG, urinalysis, hematology, clinical chemistry , composite b iomar ker panel for 
renal tubular injury , and CAD-1883 plasma concentration level on Days 1, 7, 
14, and 21 . 
Efficacy will be evaluated as follows:  
•TETRAS -PS total score change from Baseline to Day 14
•TETRAS -PS upper limb subsc
 ale sc
ore change from Baseline to Day
14

Efficacy Assessments: 
Rating Scales The treatment effect will be evaluated by [CONTACT_356385] -PS, which is 
a validated scale that has been used in recently conducted clinical trials in 
subjects w ith ET (Elble, 2012) . It provides an accurate reflection of the 
clinical response to treatment on the amplitude  of tremor over multiple bodily 
locations and over time. 
The TETRAS assessments at Screening, Baseline/ Pre-dose, Da ys 1, 7, 14, 
and Follow- up visit (Day  21) will be administered by a certified rater. 
TETRAS rater s at each site must demonstrate expertise in the administration 
of the T ETRAS according to criteria pre set by [CONTACT_356386] . The TETRAS rater s at each site can be the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a 
staff member delegated as a rater by [CONTACT_079]. Each site must 
make every effort, to the extent that is possible, to ensure av ailability of a 
primary rater and a backup rater to perform all TETRAS assessments on the 
same subject s throughout the study duration.  
The TETRAS -PS assessments at the Screening visit, Baseline/ Pre-dose, Day 
1, Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21 clinic visits will be recorded using 
videography for centralized evaluation and rating by [CONTACT_356387] s (neurologists ) with expertise in the assessment of ET.

Version Amendment 3.0,  [ADDRESS_444062] being developed as a new treatment for Essential 
Tremor (ET), a movement disorder characterized by [CONTACT_356390] ( Haubenberger et al, 2018). Tremor is defined as a rhyt hmic and 
oscillatory movement of a body part with a relatively constant frequency and variable amplitude. It is caused by [CONTACT_356377]. Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders, and ET is the most common neurologic cause of tremor. The usual 
course of ET is one of gradual progression. Patients with persistent disability from ET need 
continuous symptomatic drug therapy. Available drug treatments are not effective in all patients, often provide inadequate symptom atic relief, and the symptomatic benefit of chronic 
administration often declines over time and is frequently associated with intolerable side effects. Therapy options for ET patients who do not benefit from pharmacologic treatment include deep brain stimulation (DBS) requiring surgery for placement of brain stimulator(s), magnetic resonance image (MRI) -guided thalamotomy via focused ultrasound (to treat persistently 
disabling unilateral limb tremor), or botulinum toxin injections (to treat persistently dis abling 
hand, head, or vocal cord tremor). The efficacy of these invasive, non- pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_356364], and may be associated with intolerable side effects. Therefore, to 
address these important unmet medical needs, efforts are required to develop new treatments for 
ET targeting the cerebellar dysregulation responsible for the movement disorder. 
The cerebellum is required for coordinated motion, including movements of the hands, limbs, 
trunk, and eyes, and the synchrony of speech, all of which are disrupted in ET. The cerebellar cortex, together with the inferior olivary nucleus and deep cerebellar nuclei, comprises the olivocerebellar circuit. Cerebellar output critically depends on the precise timing of action potentials in the princ ipal neurons of the olivocerebellar circuit, especially cerebellar Purkinje 
neurons ( Llinas, 2014).  
Small conductance calcium -activated potassium (SK) channels are a family of potassium 
channels gated by [CONTACT_356378]  (Kshatri, 2018) In neurons, SK channels are gated by 
[CONTACT_356379]- gated calcium channels, which are activated by [CONTACT_356391]. SK channels regulate action potential timing by [CONTACT_356392]. In principle neurons of the olivocerebellar circuit, including cerebellar Purkinje neurons and their major afferent neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus, SK2 and SK3 channel- mediated after -hyperpolarizing currents represent a molecular pace-making 
mechanism centrally implicated in the coordination of movement.

medications, to allow the effects of previous medication(s) on tremor to be eliminated. During 
the Screening period, each subject will undergo full assessment incl uding medical and treatment 
history for ET, physical and neurological examination, in addition to laboratory testing, 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and other screening assessments. The diagnosis of ET must be established by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_356365]  
(MDS) criteria (Bhatia, 2018) with a documented severity of tremor based on the clinician-
administered TETRAS -PS (Elble, 2012).
Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study duration including in- clinic 
assessments of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs including orthostatic vital signs , 12-lead ECG, urinalysis, hematol ogy, clinical chemistry, and CAD -1883 
plasma concentration level on Days 1, 7, 14, and  21. 
Efficacy will be evaluated as follows: 
•TETRAS -PS total score change from Baseline to Day 14
•TETRAS -PS upper limb subscale score change from Baseline to Day 14
•Change from Bas
eline to Day 14 in upper limb tremor severity, mean amplitude, and
mean frequency, measured in the clinic using a wearable sensor
The TETRAS -PS will be recorded via videography for centralized evaluation and rating by [CONTACT_356393] (s).  
At the Baseline/ Pre-dose visit, subjects will undergo all required procedures including 
confirmation that all eligibility criteria are met.  
The Day  1 visit can occur up to 3 business days following the Baseline/ Pre-dose visit. Analysis 
of the pre-dose laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) should be conducted by [CONTACT_15622], with the results available and reviewed by [CONTACT_079], 
or designee, prior to dosing the subject with CAD-1883 (Day 1 visit). On Day 1, subjects will be dosed in the clinic with the first dose of CAD-1883 300 mg ( 3 capsules of 100 mg each ) and will

completed after the 2nd in clinic dose on Day 1 as specified in the SOA (Appendix A , Table  2). 
Subjects will be dispensed study drug for continued twice- daily oral self -administration at home. 
After Day  1, subjects are instructed to ingest the first daily dose of CAD-1883 of 300 mg (3 
capsules of 100 mg each). The second daily dose of CAD-1883 300 mg (3  capsules of 100 mg 
each) will be taken 8 hours (±2 hours) after the first daily dose. Each subject is provided with a 
medication diary to denote the date and time of at -home study drug dosing.  
The pre- dose laboratory assessments (chemistry,  hematology, urinalysis) should be sent to the 
Central Laboratory for analysis. Under exceptional circumstances, the pre-dose laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) can be sent for expedited analysis at the local laboratory, along with duplicate samples sent to the Central Laboratory. The results of laboratory assessments should be available an d reviewed by [CONTACT_079], or designee, prior to 
dosing the subject . 
Additionally, a urine s ample will be collected for determination of baseline levels of composite 
biomarker panel for renal tubular injury, which is not part of eligibility determination.  
Subjects will return to the site for further assessments on Day 7 ( -1 day) and Day 14 (±1 day) 
and the Follow-up visit (Day 21 [±1 day]). 
On Days 1, 7, 14, and 21, subjects will undergo safety monitoring consisting of reporting of AEs 
or SAEs, collection of vital signs including orthostatic vital signs , undergo a 12-lead ECG, and

•Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SOA ( Appendix A , Table 2) .
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed .
•Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Investigator, Medical Monitor,
and Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to  determine if the subject
should continue or discontinue study intervention.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SOA(Appendix A , Table 2) , is essential and required for study conduct.
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential
subjects meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to
record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reason s for
screening failure, as applicable.  See Section  6.1.1 for information about re- screening
subjects.
6.1 Study Visits  
The study period consists of Screen ing, Baseline/ Pre-dose visit, treatm ent period, and Follow-up 
visit for a total study period that could be up to 56 days. Subjects will undergo a screening period 
of a minimum of 14 days up to a maximum of 35 days, a 1-day Baseline/ Pre-dose visit, a Day [ADDRESS_444079] the Baseline/ Pre-dose visit, a treatment period for 
14 days (including Day  1), and a Follow-up visit at Day 21. All procedures and assessments will 
occur as indicated in the SOA ( Appendix A , Table 2).  
6.1.[ADDRESS_444080] will “wash -out” from prior tremorgenic and anti-tremor medications, to 
allow the effects of previous medication(s) on tremor to be eliminated. During the Screening period, each subject will undergo full assessment including medical and treatment history for ET, physical and neurological examination  (including a focused neurological exam to include full 
assessment of tremor per Movement Disorder Society classification criteria (Bhatia, 2018 )), in 
addition to laboratory testing, 12- lead ECG  and other screening assessments  as indicated in the 
SOA (Appendix A , Table 2).  The diagnosis of ET must be established by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_356367] (Bhatia, 2018) with a documented severity 
of tremor based on the clinician- administered TETRAS -PS (Elble, 2012). 
Per the Investigator’s discretion, re- testing of any laboratory abnormality at the central lab or at a 
local lab is permissible, with prior approval from the Medical Monitor. 
Subjects who previously failed screening can be invited to re -screen up to two additional times, 
with recommendation by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigat or and with approval by [CONTACT_1034].

with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product. All AE s, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
AEs, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from 
the time the subject signs the informed consent form ( ICF) until Follow- up Day  21. Subject s 
should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator, whether or not 
they think the event is due to study treatment. Beginning at Screening , the Investigators should 
make an assessment for AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE  eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a separate AE  on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an AE , not the procedure itself .  
Any medical condition already present at  Screening should be recorded as medical history and 
not be reported as an AE  unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at pre-dose 
change in severity , frequency, or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should 
be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at S creening  and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as AE s, as described below. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical 
and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an error should not 
be reported as an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings ( e.g., ECG  
abnormalities) should be reported as an AE  if any of the following are applicable:  
•If an interven tion is required as a result of the abnormality
•If action is required to be taken with the study drug as a result of the abnormality

will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
‘yes’ or ‘no’. 
Assessment of severity : 
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality assessment : 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed according to 
the following definitions: 
No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related ) – The time course between the administration 
of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  rules out a causal relationship and 
another cause ( concomitant drugs, ther
api[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected. 
Yes ( possibly, probably, or
 definitely related) – The time course between the adminis tration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause ( concomitant drugs, th
erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonable  possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
•The temporal sequence from study drug administration-
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. 
•Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases-
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject  may have.  
•Concomitant drug-
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject  receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
•Known response pattern for this class of study drug-
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect.  
•Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses -
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical 
and better explanation for the event.

vents 
An AE  or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or the 
Sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes: 
•Death
•A life -threatening AE
Note : An AE  or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or the Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject  at immediate risk  of death. It 
does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.

no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042] , respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) will not be 
considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
•A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to
conduct normal life functions
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect
•An important medical event.
Note : Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria may be considered 
an SA E when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency.

ness regardless of the relationship to the study drug. The 
SAE report form should be completed as thoroughly as possible; however, submission of the 
report should not be delayed if information is not available at the time of the initial report.   
Follow-Up Reports 
The Investigator must continue to follow the subject  until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) , or the 
subject  dies.  
Within [ADDRESS_444085] update the paper SAE report form and the AE form electronically in the eCRF  and submit any supporting 
documentation ( e.g., patient  discharge summary or autopsy reports) to CRO  via fax or email.

In order to obtain orthostatic VS, the subjects will undergo the following procedures in sequential order: 
1. The subject will rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662]-supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_444096] will then be asked to sit on the edge of the bed/chair with feet on the floor (or with feet dangling from the bed/chair depending on the height of the bed/chair) for approximately 30 seconds. 
4. The person performing the assessment will then ask the question, “Are you ready to 
stand?”  
• If the subject responds in the affirmative, the subject will proceed to stand and 
then be asked to remain standing for 2 minutes. After standing for 2 minutes, blood pressure and 
heart rate will be recorded.  
• If the subject states that he or she is not ready to stand, the subject will be allowed to sit 
as positioned for one additional minute and will be asked again if they are ready to stand. The subject will pro ceed to stand. After standing for 2 minutes, one measurement will be 
taken for blood pressure and heart rate.

validated scale that has been used in recently conducted clini cal trials in subjects with ET ( Elble, 
2012). It provides an accurate reflection of the clinical response to treatment on the amplitude of 
tremor over multiple  bodily locations and over time. 
The TETRAS assessments at Screening, Baseline/ Pre-dose, D ays 1, 7, 14, and Follow-up visit 
(Day  21) will be administered by a certified rater. TETRAS raters at each site must demonstrate 
expertise in the administration of the TETRAS according to criteria preset by [CONTACT_356401] s. The TETRAS raters at each site can be the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a staff 
member delegated as a rater by [CONTACT_079]. Each site must make every effort, to the ex tent that is possible, to ensure availability of a primary rater and a backup rater to perform 
all TETRAS assessments on the same subjects throughout the study duration. 
The TETRAS -PS assessments at the Screening visit, Baseline/ Pre-dose, Days  1, 7, 14, an d 21 
clinic visits  will be recorded using videography for centralized evaluation and rating by 
[CONTACT_356402] (neurologists ) with expertise in the assessment of ET.

8.2.1 In-Clinic Assessment  
The wearable sensor measurements of upper limb tremor  assessments will be completed  in the 
clinic once at an y time during the Screening visit and at two different times during the  
Baseline/ Pre-dose site visit.  
During the site visit on Day 1  the wearable sensor measurements of upper limb tremor will be 
captured once,  2 to 4 hours following the second in -clinic dose. 
During the site visit on Days 7 and 14, the wearable sensor measurements of upper limb tremor 
will be captured once,  2 to 4 hours following the in- clinic dose. 
During the Follow-up visit (Day 21), the wearable sensor measurements of upper limb tremor will be completed at any time during the visit.  
In-clinic assessments will be obtained during the performance of 4 maneuvers:  
1. extended arms posture,
2.wing -beating posture,
3.kinetic “finger -to-chin” movement , and
4. arm on table posture.
These assessments will be performed twice, once with the sensor on the left index finger and 
once with the sensor on the right index finger.

11.1 Analysis Populations 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 
Safety popula
tion: All enrolled subjects who take at least 1 dose of study intervention. 
•Full Analysis Set (FAS): FAS consists of subjects in the safety population who had at least
[ADDRESS_444101] -baseline assessmen t of both TETRA S-PS . FAS will be used to 
summarize all efficacy data.  
•Exposed Population (EP): The exposed population includes all subjects in the Safetypopulation who are at least 90% compliant with study treatment
Selected efficacy analyses will be repeated in this population if this population differs from 
FAS.  
11.2 Statistical Me
thods  
The statistical analysis plan  (SAP)  will be developed and finalized before database lock and will 
describe the subject populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for 
missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analy ses 
of the primary and secondary endpoints. 
11.2.1 Analysis of Primary (Safety) Endpoint Data 
•Vital sign parameters outside the normal range will be listed and flagged for review.
•Orthostatic vital signs parameters for blood pressure outside the ranges specified inSection  7.10 below will be listed and flagged for review.
•Descriptive statistics of absolute and change from Baseline (pre-dose) SBP, DBP, pulse rate,
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral temperature at each timepoint, will be tabulated. The mean change
from Baseline data will also be plotted across time.
•Twelve- lead ECG p arameters will be listed with any values outside the normal range flagged.
Descriptive statistics of absolute and change from Baseline (pre-dose) heart rate, PR, QRS,
QT, and QTcF interval s at each timepoint, will be tabulated. The mean change from Baseline
data will also be plotted across time.
•In addition, frequencies of QTcF data will be calculated according to the followingcategories:

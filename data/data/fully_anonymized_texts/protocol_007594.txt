Study Phase  3 
Study Objectives  Primary objective :  Assess the efficacy of a levonorgestrel  52 mg  
intrauterine system (LNG20  IUS) as a treatment for  heavy menstrual 
bleeding.  
Secondary objectives : Assess  safety, tolerability, bleeding patterns, and 
continuation rates of LNG20  IUS in women using LNG20  IUS for heavy 
menstrual bleeding . 
Planned Study 
Dates Start of stu dy/recruitment:  October  2018  
End of recruitment:  December 2020  
End of study treatment:  July [ADDRESS_946340] -treatment follow -up:  August [ADDRESS_946341] treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding, provide consent, and 
satisfy entry criteria will be enrolled for treatment.   
Study Design  The study is a multicenter, open -label, evaluation of the efficacy and safety 
of LNG20  IUS for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.   
After consent is obtained, screening procedures will be performed and 
eligible subjects enrolled into the trial.  The Screening Phase will include  
up to four visits (Visits 1 to 4) to  evaluat e menstrual bl ood loss (MBL)  in 
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 of 107 
 up to three  cycles to establish a diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding 
(MBL ≥ 80 mL/cycle for two of three cycles) and confirm eligibility.  
Subjects will receive standardized feminine hygiene products and detailed 
instructions on how to record daily vaginal bleeding  in a diary .   
Visit 1  will include consent and  initial screening  activities . Visits 2, 3 and 
4 (if needed) will occur  approximately monthly (ideally within 5 days of 
end of menses) to collect feminine hygiene products. The products will be 
evaluated using the alkaline hematin (AH) method to evaluate  MBL . 
Subjects who have qualifying MBL  in at least two of three screening 
cycle s and  who meet  all other eligibility requirements may enter  the six -
month Treatment Phase (Visits 5 to 8). If the qualifying MBL occurs in 
the fir st two screening cycles, a third cycle and Visit 4 will not occur.  
The Enrollment Visit (Visit 5) is when IUS placement occurs.  The study 
IUS will be inserted by a study Investigator using a standardized insertion 
procedure.  
Subjects will be evaluated du ring study treatment use for up to 
approximately 6 months .  Study assessments will be performed at a clinic 
visit at Treatment Phase Month 1  (Visit 6), and at the end of Cycle 3 (Visit 
7) and Cycle 6 (Visit 8 /study exit ).  The IUS will be removed when 
requested  or when clinically indicated ; if the IUS is removed before Cycle 6, 
Visit 8/study exit procedures will be completed at the visit for removal . At 
the end of the [ADDRESS_946342] s 
or visits, as appropriate,  until the event is resolved or stabilized .   
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 107 
 Routine safety monitoring (adverse event assessments and vital signs) will 
be conducted for all subjects at all protocol study visits .   
Investigational 
Drugs:  A levonorgestrel 52 mg IUS (LNG20  IUS, marketed in the U.S. as Liletta®) 
with an initial levonorgestrel release rate of approximately 20 mcg/day will 
be evaluated.  There will be no comparator.  
Dosing Regimen:  A study Investigator will insert a LNG20  IUS into the uterus using 
standardized procedures  in subjects who qualify after screening and 
desire to enroll . 
The IUS may be removed at any time  if requested by [CONTACT_697236] d necessary by [CONTACT_737].  
Subjects who experience IUS expulsion (part ial or complete) may have 
another study IUS inserted ; only one replacement IUS is allowed per 
subject. Replacement can occur only if all of the following conditions are 
met: 
• Reinsertion occurs  no more than 14 days  after the expulsion ; 
• Reinsertion occurs at least 7 days prior to treatment Cycle 3 or 
Cycle 6 ; 
• Reinsertion cannot occur during treatment Cycle 3 or Cycle 6 ; 
• Pregnancy can reasonably be excluded . 
An IUS removed during the study will not be replaced with a new LNG20  
IUS except when the IUS is removed because of  incorrect IUS placement 
at the enrollment visit (first attempt only) or within two weeks of an 
expulsion (complete or partial) during the Treatment Phase . 
Primary Outcome 
Measure:  The proportion  of subjects with successful treatment , defined as:  
• End of Treatment MBL < 80 mL, and  
• End of Treatment MBL 50% or less than baseline  
Baseline MBL is the MBL averaged over each of the cycles measured 
during the Screening Phase.  End of Treatment MBL is the MBL during 
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 107 
 the sixth 28 -day cycle after initial LNG20 IUS insertion. This outcome 
will be established in the Modified -Intent -To-Treat  (MITT) population.   
Key Secondary 
Outcome 
Measures:  Key secondary outcome measures will be:  
• Absolute change from  baseline MBL to  mid-treatment MBL (C ycle 3)  
• Percent change from base line MBL to mid -treatment MBL (C ycle 3)  
• Absolute change from baseline MBL to end of treatment MBL (Cycle 
6) 
• Percent change from baselin e MBL to end of treatment MBL (C ycle 6)  
• Changes f rom baseline to mid -treatment (C ycle 3) , from mid -treatment 
(Cycle 3) to end of treatment (Cycle 6) and from baseline to end of

subjects with major protocol deviations (to be identified prior to 
data lock).  
Each treatment cycle will be considered as a 28-day interval with the day 
of IUS placement  as day 1 .   
The primary efficacy analysis of successful treatment rate will be 
analyzed with 95% confidence interval for subjects in the MITT 
population. A point estimate of 80% or higher successful treatment rate 
with a lower bound of 70% or higher will establish the efficacy of LNG20  
IUS for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding  in the study.   
All other secondary endpoint analyses will be  descriptive.  
All treatment emergent adverse event data will be presented by [CONTACT_53157], preferred term and treatment group.  Quantitative 
safety variables (e.g., vital signs) will be summarized at each visit and by 
[CONTACT_697239].   
Sample Size:  Approximately 100 women will be enrolled into the study  treatment 
phase  with the goal that 85 women will complete the study to achieve the 
lower bound 70% or higher of a two-sided 95% confidence interval for an 
anticipated successful treatmen t rate 80% or higher .

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Normal menstrual blood loss ( MBL) ranges between 20 and 60 mL /cycle.  Heavy menstrual 
bleeding (HMB), formerly referred to as menorrhagia, is defined as excessive blood loss that 
occurs alone or in combination with other symptoms and has a negative impact on a 
woman’s physical, social, emotional, and material quality of lif e (Qiu et al., 2014 ). 
Approximately 30% of women are affected by [CONTACT_697240], 
resulting in increased health costs (OHTAC, 2016). A variety of functional, structural, and 
non-structural conditions can cause HMB, including adenomyosis , leiomyomas, and 
coagulopathies as well as iatrogenic causes. In many women, the underlying cause of HMB 
is unknown and is referred to as functional HMB ( Mawet et al., 2014 ). Heavy menstrual 
bleeding is commonly defined as MBL exceeding 80 mL of blood los s per cycle, although 
only about half of women who complain of HMB actually meet these criteria (Qiu et al., 
2014; Bahamondes et al., 2015 ). Clinical guidelines recognize that because HMB has a major 
impact on a woman’s quality of life , the diagnosis shoul d be based on subjective measures 
rather than the objective measure of MBL (NCCWCH, 2007 ). However, the quantity of MBL 
is still important for predicting outcomes as iron depletion and anemia can occur when 
menstrual flow exceeds 60 and 120 mL, respectivel y (NCCWCH, 2007).  
Although  hysterectomy is the preferred  option for  definitive treatment for women with HMB , 
medical management is always indicated first ; hysterectomy, like  any major surgical 
procedure, has potential significant complications and incurs social and economic costs, 
including incompatibility with a woman’s wish to remain fertile ( Maybin and Critchley , 
2015, 2016; OHTAC, 2016 ). Endometrial ablation emerged as a more conservative surgical 
treatment for HMB in the 1990’s but still result s in impaired fertility. Currently, reversible 
non-hormonal and hormonal medical treatments are available as first -line therapy for most 
women with HMB regardless of their desire for future fertility.   
Non-hormonal treatments for HMB include antifibrinolytics an d non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are off -label uses of these products in the U .S. Both 
antifibrinolytics and NSAIDs produce gastrointestinal side effects but only require dosing 
during periods of heavy menstrual flow. Tranexamic acid  is an antifibrinolytic medication 
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 107 
 that counteracts the degradation of fibrin clots that form to induce hemostasis during the 
menstrual phase. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs inhibit cyclooxygenase and limit the 
production of inflammatory mediators th at can lead to increased and prolonged tissue 
damage during menstruation (Maybin and Critchley, 2016).  
Hormonal treatments for HMB include oral or injectable progestins, combined hormonal 
contraceptives  (CHCs)  and intrauterine systems (IUSs).  CHCs  decrea se menstrual flow and 
reduced symptoms for women with HMB (Bahamondes et al., 2015). During the menstrual 
cycle, progesterone levels sharply decline in the absence of pregnancy and trigger an influx 
of inflammatory mediators into the endometrial environmen t, leading to shedding and 
menstruation. However, maintenance of progesterone levels, as with progestin -only therapi[INVESTIGATOR_697205], limits endometrial inflammation and 
prevents menstruation, resulting in an effective  HMB treatment (Maybin and Critchley, 
2016). CHCs  are available as oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_71678], vaginal rings  used monthly , or patches  
changed weekly .  
In the early 1990s, the progestin -releasing IUS containing levonorgestrel (LNG) 52 mg 
emerged as an option for medical management of HMB. While combined oral 
contraceptives, NSAIDs, and antifibr inolytics can reduce MBL by 50%  within a few cycles 
of treatment , a LNG 52 mg IUS can decrease menstrual loss by 71% within 6  months and up 
to 94% after 1 year .  Additionally, the LNG IUS can  lead to greater improvement in women’s 
assessment of the effect of HMB on their daily routine and psychological and physical well -
being com pared to usual medical treatment ( Gupta et al., 2013 ; Qiu et al., 2014; Maybin and 
Critchley, 2016 ; Kaunitz  et al., 2010 ). An IUS has the additional advantage of a “fit and  
forget” method that increases patient compliance.  
A substantial body of literature has demonstrated the efficacy of the LNG  [ADDRESS_946356]-line treatment for HMB  (Espey , 2013 ). Currently only one LNG 
IUS, Mirena®, is approved in the U .S. for HMB treatment in women who choose to use 
intrauterine contraception as their method of contraception  (Mirena Package Insert) . The 
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 107 
 other approved LNG 52 mg IUS, LNG20  IUS (brand name [CONTACT_697288]®), is currently approved 
only for contraception in the U .S. although it is approved for HMB treatment in Europe and 
Africa (under the brand names  Levosert®, Avibela®, MireffikTM, BenilexaTM, DonasertTM, 
LevonortisTM, and TresovelleTM). If approved for HMB treatment  in the U.S. , LNG20 IUS 
would  offer prescribers and patients another HMB treatment option.  Other currently available 
lower -dose LNG IUS products are not approved for HMB treatment.  
LNG20 IUS has been investigated in a Phase 3, multicenter, single -blind randomized trial in 
Europe to assess the non-inferiority as  compared to Mir ena in patients wi th HMB  utilizing a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_697206] .  Enrollment of 280 subjects was completed in 
January 2009 and 50% were randomized to LNG20  IUS.  LNG20 IUS substantially reduced 
MBL  in these women and based on  this trial was approved in [ADDRESS_946357] hoc  analysis supports 
that LNG20 IUS was generally well tolerated in female subjects with HMB .   
The LNG20 IUS consists of a T -shaped polyethylene frame (T -body) w ith a steroid reservoir 
around the vertical stem.  The steroid reservoir is covered with a polydimethylsiloxane 
membrane which controls the release rate of levonorgestrel from the reservoir.  The reservoir 
contains levonorgestrel 52 mg , providing an initia l release rate of approximately 20 mcg/day  
(Creinin  et al., 2016 ).  A polypropylene monofilament blue thread is attached to the end of 
the vertical stem.  Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for full details on the components of 
LNG20  IUS. 
 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
This study is being performed to evaluate the Medicines360 levonorgestrel [ADDRESS_946358] of LNG20 IUS on mens trual blood  
loss (MBL) from baseline to 6 months (during the sixth 28-day cycle)  after initial LNG20 IUS 
insertion in women with HMB .  The primary outcome measure is  the p roportion of subjects

 with successful treatment define d as: 
o end of treatment MBL <80  mL, and  
o end of treatment MBL 50% or less than baseline  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are to assess:  
• The absolute change from  baseline MBL to mid -treatment MBL (C ycle 3)  
• The percent change from base line MBL to mid -treatment MBL (C ycle 3)  
• The absolute change from baseline MBL to end of treatment MBL (Cycle 6)  
• The percent change from baselin e MBL to end of treatment MBL (C ycle 6)  
• Changes fro m baseline to mid -treatment  Cycle 3, from baseline to  end of treatment 
Cycle 6, and from mid-treatment Cycle 3 to end of treatment Cycle 6 in the number of 
days of bleeding, spotting, bleeding and spotting and number of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
• Percent change in hemoglobin, hematocrit and serum ferritin  from baseline to mid -
treatment (Visit 7), from baseline to end of treatment (Visit 8), and from mid -treatment 
(Visit 7) to end of treatment (Visit 8)  
• Continuation rate during Treatment Phase  
• Subject ive assessment of menstrual bleeding changes  
• Adverse even ts 
 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
This is a Phase 3, open -label, multicenter evaluation of the efficacy of a levonorgestrel  52 mg 
intrauterine system (LNG20  IUS) for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding .   
Approximately [ADDRESS_946359] enrollment based on parity , weight or BMI.   Women who do not 
require contraception (e.g., not heterosexually active, using permanent contraception) may be 
included.  
Only women who are willing to forgo contraindicated confounding treatments and systemic 
hormones for the ascribed pe riod prior to screening, during the Screening Phase and during the 
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_946360] use appropriate 
contraceptive methods  during the screening phase , such as male or female permanent 
sterilization,  be willing to use a barrier method, withdrawal  (if has been using as current method 
prior to screenin g) or abstinence .  No other contracepti ve is required during the treatment phase , 
although subjects may choose to do so as long as contraindicated products are not used . 
After written consent is obtained , the subject will undergo a Screening Phase to estab lish 
eligibility and confirm the diagnosis of HMB.  At the  initial screening visit (Visit 1) , medical 
history  and vital signs  including height and weight  will be obtained and a  gynecologic  exam , 
uterine ultrasound  (unless performed within 6 months) , endome trial biopsy (unless 
performed within 6 months) , high sensitivity urine pregnancy test , gonorrhea/Chlamydia 
testing  and blood tests to evaluate eligibility criteria will be performed.  Women who meet 
entry criteria at Visit 1, exc lusive of  pending testing results (e.g., blood tests, endometrial 
biopsy, Pap test, etc.) will initiate participation in up to 3 more screening visits (Visit 2, Visit 
3 and Visit 4) over approximately 90 days to establish the diagnosis of HMB based on MBL 
of ≥80 mL/cycle in at least 2 of 3 cycles as assessed by [CONTACT_697241] (AH) method.    
The subject will be provided specific brands of feminine hygiene products and trained to 
complete a daily  bleeding d iary.  Any subject for whom a pending test result from Visit 1 is 
reported  with an exclusionary result will be discontinued from screening  (screen failure) . 
The diagnosis of HMB will be established in 2 -3 screening phase  cycles . 
A Screening Cycle may be re peated  under the following conditions:  
• If a subject indicates she was unable to collect all used feminine hygiene products 
during a menses and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the discarded products 
contained a substantial volume of blood, then that cycle collection may be discarded 
and the cycle collection repeated ; 
• If a subject indicates she used non -study feminine hygiene products and , in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , these products contained a substantial volume of the 
blood to be assayed, then that cycle collection may be discarded and the cycle 
collection repeated.   
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 107 
 • If subject indicates that the first  cycle had significantly less bleeding than her usual 
cycle , then that cycle colle ction may be discarded and the cycle collection repeated 
(first cycle only).  
Only one screening cycle may be repeated.  Any screening cycle collection that is assayed 
cannot be repeated . 
All screening cycles, including a repeated screening cycle, must be c onsecutive.  
The Screening Phase MBL is the MBL averaged over all cycles measured during the 
Screening Phase.  Each Screening Phase visit will include a high sensitivity urine pregnancy 
test.   
Enrollment (Visit 5) will occur when the LNG20  IUS is inserted by a study Investigator  
using standardized procedures  and must occur within 45 days of the Screening Phase vis it 
(i.e., Visit 3 or Visit 4) in which eligibility is established .  Up to two insertion attempts will 
be allowed  within [ADDRESS_946361]  which 
will be repeated if a second insertion attempt is required on a separate day . Additionally, 
gonorrhea/Chlamydia  testing will be repeated for any women with a change in sexual partner 
since last tested, but IUS insertion does not require waiting for the results.   The following 
baseline assessments will occur on the day of the initial insertion attempt and not repeated 
should a second attempt on a different day be needed: hemoglobin, hematocrit and ferritin 
testing , and a  subjective assessment of menst rual bleeding using a Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS) questionnaire.  
In the T reatment Phase s ubjects will continue to  use only the study provided feminine hygiene 
products and  record their bleeding on a daily diary.  Feminine hygiene product collection will be 
limited to Cycle 3 and Cycle 6 during the Treatment Phase; no repeat collection is permitted.  
Study assessments  will be performed at  clinic visit s at Treatment Phase Month 1  (Visit 6) , and 
at the end of Cycle 3  (Visit 7) and  Cycle 6  (Visit 8).   Each visit will include a high sensitivity 
urine pregnancy test .  Ferritin/hematology  assessments and  a subjective bleeding assessment 
using a VAS questionnaire will be performed at Visit s 7 and 8.  The IUS can be removed during 
the study when requested by [CONTACT_70579] t or when clinically indicated.  At the end of 6 28-day 
cycle s of use , unless medically contraindicated, study participants may opt to keep the IUS  or 
otherwise it will be removed . 
Medicines360

Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 107 
 Participation will end at Visit 8 except for the following circumstances:  
• The IUS was removed at Visit 8: these subjects will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 7 to 10 days after the 
visit to assess bleeding and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_697207] -related or IUS 
procedure -related adverse events.   
• Subjects with ongoing IUS -related adve rse events after completion of the Treatment 
Phase that are not resolved or stabilized will have monthly contacts or visits, as 
appropriate, until the event is resolved or stabilized.  
Routine safety monitoring (including clinically indicated  physical exams , adverse event 
assessments, and vital signs) will be conducted for all subjects.   
3.1 Outcome Measures  
3.1.1 Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome measure will be the proportion  of subjects with successful treatment of 
heavy menstrual bleeding based on the decrease in MBL from baseline to 6 months (during 
the sixth 28 -day cycle) after initial LNG20  IUS insertion .  This outcome will be established 
in the Modified -Intent -To-Treat ( MITT) population measuring the change in absolute value 
from baseline MBL to the end of treatment MBL.  Baseline MBL is the MBL averaged over 
all of the cycles measured during the Screening Phase.  A subject with successful treatment 
will be defined as :   
• end of treatment MBL <80  mL, and  
• a decrease  to a value of no greater than 50% of the baseline MBL  
3.1.2 Key Secondary Outcome Measures  
Key secondary outcome measures will be:  
• Absolute change from  baseline MBL to mid -treatment MBL (C ycle 3)  
• Percent change from base line MBL to mid -treatment MBL (C ycle 3)  
• Absolute change from baseline MBL to end of treatment MBL (Cycle 6)  
• Percent change from baselin e MBL to end of treatment MBL (C ycle 6)  
• Changes f rom baseline to mid -treatment (C ycle 3), fr om mid -treatment (Cy cle 3) to end

All expelled (when available) and remov ed IUSs will be stored.  All retained used IUSs will be 
appropriately disposed of only after accountability verification by a study monitor.  
5.4 IUS Replacement  
Subjects experiencing an expulsion (complete or partial) may have another study IUS inserted ; 
only one replacement IUS is allowed per subject. Two insertion attempts are allowed as long as 
replacement criteria are met for both attempts.  Replacement can occur only if all of the 
following conditions are met:  
• Reinsertion occurs no more than 14 days after the expulsion;  
• Reinsertion occurs at least 7 day s prior to treatment Cycle 3 or Cycle 6;  
• Reinsertion cannot occur during treatment Cycle 3 or Cycle 6.  
• Pregnancy can reasonably be excluded  
5.[ADDRESS_946372] beginning 30 days prior to screening  through IUS discontinuation  (Visit 
8/Early Discontinuation) and for those subjects with continuing evaluation of an ongoing IUS -
related or IUS procedure -related adverse event  through resolution  or stabilization .  All 
concomitant medications, including excluded therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], must be documented in the 
Concomitant Medication CRF.   Subjects who use excluded therapi[INVESTIGATOR_697213] .  The Medical Monitor  should be contact[CONTACT_697242] .

 • Hormonal contraceptives  
o EXCEPTION: emergency contraception in any situation when the subject feels the 
IUS expelled, she subsequently had intercourse and was not using any other 
permitted method of contraception (e.g., barrier or sterilization)  
 
o Subjects will not be discontinued from the study because of emergency 
contraceptive use if the IUS is eventually identified to be in the correct location in 
the uterine cavity  
• Use of antifibrinolytics, platelet aggregation inhibitors, anticoagulants or other simila r 
medications that can increase or decrease bleeding  
o EXCEPTION: NSAIDs can be used as second -line treatment for pain 
management . Acetaminophen should be the first line treatment for pain 
management  but if not effective then NSAID use is allowed   
• Iron or folate supplement use are allowed if currently in use at screening entry but initiation 
of any new iron  or folate  supplementation during study participation is allowed only for the 
treatment of clinically significant iron -deficiency anemia  
• Any non-contraceptive estrogen, progesterone , testosterone , or gonadotropin  (e.g. hCG)  
• Misoprostol on the day before or day of IUS insertion or removal  
• Any investigational treatment or medication other than the LNG20  IUS (experimental 
diagnostic testing is allowed but may not substitute for any study required evaluations)

 laboratory  normal ranges are available). Blood testing does not require fasting. Documented 
Pap test results indicating that no further testing or follow -up duri ng the duration of study 
participation is indicated may be used for screening.  Additionally, endometrial biopsies will 
be performed by [CONTACT_779] (unless a documented biopsy result obtained  within 6 months prior 
to screening  is available ).  High sensitivity  urine pregnancy testing may be performed  in the 
clinic.   
6.4 Screening Transvaginal Ultrasonography  
A transvaginal ultrasound during initial screening (unless documented by a formal report

3 cycles (Visit 7 ) and 6 cycles (Visit 8 ) of treatment . 
6.6 IUS Insertion Definitions  
Up to two insertion attempts are  permitted.   
• An insertion attempt  starts with placement of the IUS inserter through  the external 
cervical os .  IUS insertion ends with completion of cutting the IUS threads following 
successful intrauterine IUS placement  or IUS insertion failure . 
▪ IUS insertion failure is considered to occur when after the IUS inserter passes 
through the external  os of the cervix  and completion of IUS insertion is not 
achieved.   
▪ Successful IUS insertion  is considered as retention of the I US in the uterus 
through cutting of the strings, unless removed for incorrect placement as 
determined by [CONTACT_697243]; the day of successful IUS insertion is considered Study Day 1 .

Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 107 
 • Note that IUS in sertion  is the general process that starts with opening of the LNG20  
IUS kit with the intent to perform an insertion. The insertion process may stop before 
IUS insertion is attempted (see definition above); in such circumstances, an IUS 
insertion attempt h as not occurred.  Examples of procedure discontinuation prior to an 
insertion attempt include:  
▪ notable defect upon inspection of the product  
▪ loss of product sterility  
▪ inability to sound the uterus  
▪ subject intolerance of the procedure prior to LNG20 IUS con tact with the

The Treatment Phase Visit 5 should  occur within 45 days of the screening visit  (i.e., Visit 3 or 
Visit 4)  that determined eligibility .  An IUS i nsertion attempt enrolls the subject into the 
Treatment Phase.   Second insertion attempts are allowed  and can occur on the same day or 
different day , but a second attempt must be within [ADDRESS_946400] attempt .  The da y of 
successful  IUS insertion is considered Study  Day 1 .   
6.8.1 Enrollment visit (insertion) scheduling  
• The LNG20 IUS can be inserted at any time the provider is reasonable certain the 
woman is not pregnant.  Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception 
prior to initiation of the product  
• If the LNG20 IUS is inserted after the f irst [ADDRESS_946401] is not using permanent contraception , she should use a barrier 
contraceptive method or abstain from heterosexual vaginal intercourse for 7 days 
after insertion to prevent pregnancy  
6.8.2 Enrollment Procedures  
• Prior to IUS insertion  attempt : 
o Review medical history changes since the prior  visit 
o Review medication history changes since the prior  visit 
o Obtain blood pressure, pulse and weight  
o Obtain high sensitivity urine pregnancy test (if test is positive then subject is 
a screen failure)  
o Confirm eligibility criteria  
o Subject completion of Baseline VAS questionnaire  (Appendix D) 
o Collect venous blood sample  for hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin  
o Perform pelvic exam (repeat exam if second insertion attempt on separat e 
day) 
▪ Perform Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing if the subject has a new 
sexual partner since the Screening Phase Visit 1

 • IUS insertion can occur without test results  
• Women with positive tests should  be contact[CONTACT_697251]  
▪ If a pelvic exam demonstrates signs of acute cervical or uterine 
infection, provide appropriate antibiotic treatment and postpone the 
insertion attempt until subject is  considered clinically cured for at 
least 7 days  
▪ Vaginal infections (e.g., trichomaniasis, symptomatic bacterial 
vaginosis or symptomatic vaginal candidiasis) can be treated at the 
time of IUS insertion  
• Insert the study IUS using the techniques described in  the Investigator’s Brochure  
o Up to two attempts for insertion can be made  (on the same day or 30 days of 
each other)  
▪ If a second attempt is performed on a different day, repeat all steps 
listed under “Prior to IUS insertion attempt” except blood testing  and 
VAS questionnaire  
▪ Each attempt should use a new IUS  
o If the IUS is unable to be inserted after two attempts or the uterus sounds to 
<5.5 cm:  
▪ If there are no AEs related to the insertion attempt (s), the subject 
will be discontinued from the study and is not required to have any 
subsequent study -related follow -up 
▪ If there are AEs related to the insertion attempt (s) the subject should 
be followed at appropriate intervals by [CONTACT_697252] d, after which 
the subject can be discontinued from the study  
• Evaluate for adverse events related to IUS placement procedure  
• Distribute study -specific feminine hygiene products and diaries as needed

 o How to correctly check  for the IUS string in the vagina  (subjects will not be 
required to routinely check for IUS placement but if a subject believes the 
IUS is expelled or no longer in the correct place, she can check for the IUS 
string if she desires ) 
o Do not use a Diva Cup to  collect bleeding because it could cause IUS 
expulsion ; only use the provided feminine hygiene products  
o Call for an urgent study visit if she:  
▪ Suspects she is pregnant  
▪ Has expelled the IUS  (if subject has the expelled IUS, she should 
bring it  to the study site at the next visit)  
▪ Has symptoms of a pelvic infection  
▪ Attempts to feel the strings and cannot  feel the m 
▪ Believes she feels the IUS in her cervix or vagina  
o If an urgent study visit is required, she should refrain from having sex or use 
appropriate non -hormonal contraception until a study  evaluation is 
completed  
• Counsel regarding ST I precautions  
• Schedule Visit 6 for 4 to 6 weeks after successful study IUS insertion (Day 28 to

6.13 Diagnostic Ultrasound  Examination s 
Diagnostic ultrasound examinations may be required during th e study for pregnancy (see 
Appendix F), missing IUS  strings (see Appendix G), confirmation of IUS location  or possible 
IUS related adverse events.  Any time an ultrasound examination is performed for diagnostic 
purposes, the image must be documented in a p hoto or digital image to be included in the source 
documentation.  If the exam is not documented in a formal report , a high resolution copy of the 
image documentation should be forwarded  within 5 business days for a verifying review by [CONTACT_697258].  All ultrasound findings should be 
documented as follows:  
• Printed image(s) with the subject’s study number on the image  
• Indication, impression and plan related to the images written in the source documentation  
All ultrasound examination documentation should be maintained with the subject’s study source 
documentation.

the course of study participation (i.e., within approximately 10 months after screening) .  A prior 
printed cytology report may be used in place of performing Pap testing at the Screening Visit 1.  
6.15 Management of Abnormal Testing During  the Study  
Clinically significant study -related results should be managed as follows:  
• Gonorrhea or Chlamydia:  treatment in accordance with current Centers for Disease Control 
and P revention ( CDC ) guidelines.  The IUS should not be removed because of a positive 
test or a diagnosis of cervicitis   
• Hemoglobin/hematocrit and ferritin :  a value consistent with clinically significant anemia 
should be evaluated and treated within the local standard of care  
6.[ADDRESS_946412] for which the sample or specimen could not produce a result.  
• Screening Phase Tests:  
o Visit 2 allows for repeat of unevaluable tests  
o If the samples or specimens from Visit 2 are also unevaluable then repeat at Visit 3 –
the results must be available and reviewed for eligibility prior to enrollment  
• Treatment Phase Tests (including Treatment Phase Discontinuation/Early Discontinuation)  
o Unevaluable hemoglobi n/hematocrit or ferritin should be repeated as soon as 
possible at an Unscheduled Visit

reduction in MBL with LNG  52 mg  IUS is greater than that achieved with combined oral

 contraceptives (COC), tranexamic acid, or long-course (≥3weeks/cycle) oral progest ins (Bitzer  et 
al., 2015 ).   
In a randomized study comparing LNG 52 mg IUS to MPA  over 6 months , approximately 8 5% 
of the LNG IUS users had successful treatment compared to 22% of MPA  users.  Treatment 
success was defined as achieving MBL of <[ADDRESS_946414]  a 50% reduction from baseline .  
Additionally, bleeding was rated as significantly improved according to investigator assessment 
(93.6% LNG IUS vs. 61.0% MPA) and self -assessment (93.6% LNG IUS vs. 67.1% MPA)  
(Kaunitz  et al., 2010 ).  In a randomized study in Europe comparing LNG20 IUS to Mirena , both 
products produced similar reductions in MBL after the 6 months of study treatment (79.0% vs. 
79.2%, respectively)  (Mawet  et al.,  2014 ). 
A study comparing the LNG 52 mg IUS  to a usual -treatment group ( tranexamic acid, mefenamic 
acid, COC or oral progesterone)  demonstrated that improvements as measure d by [CONTACT_102] -
reported Menorrhagia  Multi -Attribute Scale (MMAS) were significantly higher at the end of 6 
months of treatment with the LNG IUS group comp ared to the usual treatment group (32.7 points 
and 21.4 points, respectively).  Additionally, improvements in all MMAS domains (practical 
difficulties, social life, family life, work and daily routine, psychological well -being, and 
physical health) were si gnificantly better for the LNG IUS group.  At the end of two -years 64% 
of the LNG IUS group continued to use the product compared to 38% of the usual -treatment 
group (Gupta  et al., 2013 ).   
Hemoglobin and ferritin values increase with LNG 52 mg IUS use in women with HMB.  In a 
randomized study assessing the efficacy of a LNG IUS and oral MPA (10 mg/day for 10 days) in 
women with confirmed HMB , hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels were assessed at baseline, 
and at Cycle s 3 and 6 of treatment .  Baseline media n hemoglobin and ferritin levels were 12.4 
g/dL and 19.0 mcg/L with the LNG IUS and 12.2 g/dL and 19.0 mcg/L with oral MPA, 
respectively. At Cycle 6, the corresponding medians were 13.4 g /dL and 34.0 mcg/L with the 
LNG IUS and 12.6 g/dL and 21.0 mcg/L with  oral MPA  (Kaunitz  et al., 2010 ). The i ncreases 
from baseline to Cycle 6 were greater in the LNG IUS group than in the oral MPA group for 
hemoglobin levels (7.5% vs. 1.9%; p<.001) and median serum ferritin levels (68.8% vs. 14.3%; 
p<.001).

 Of note, amenorr hea rates in women who use the LNG 52 mg IUS for HMB are lower than the 
rates reported in women who use the LNG 52 mg IUS primarily for contraception. In 
contracepting women, approximately 20% of women are amenorrheic for a period of [ADDRESS_946415] year of use (Andersson et al., 1994, Schreiber et al ., 2018); this 
amenorrhea rate is reached within about 9 months of use (Schreiber et al., 2018).  Pooled data 
from four randomized trials comparing the levonorgestrel 52 mg IUS to medroxyprogesterone 
acetate orally, tranexamic acid orally, mefenamic acid orally and endometrial resection in 163 
women with HMB demonstrates the change in bleeding seen in this specific population (Jensen  
et al.,  2013).  Amenorrhea rates in this populati on were 2% at 6 months and 9% at one year.  By 
[CONTACT_122467], an additional 24% were reporting infrequent bleeding/spotting.  Only 6% of women 
using the LNG [ADDRESS_946416] 
use. 
7.1.2 Contraception  
Subjects at risk for pregnancy should be using a contraceptive method during screening phase. 
However, during the Treatment Phase, subjects are not required to use a contraceptive other than 
the LNG20  IUS. Any method of contraception may not prevent pregnancy.  LNG20 IUS is 
currently FDA -approved for contraception for up to 6 years of use.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Ectopic Pregnancy  
Women who become pregnant while using an LNG IUS can experience an ectopic (extrauterine) 
pregnancy.  Overall, the risk of a woman having an ectopic pregnancy is lower than the general 
population because the risk of pregnancy is significantly decreased.   
 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Effects on gestation and offspring  
When pregnancy continues with the LNG20  IUS in place, the risks of long -term effects on the 
offspring are unknown.  Based on data from copper IUDs, pregna ncies that continue are at an 
increased risk of pre -term (<37 weeks) delivery as compared to women who conceive without an 
IUD in place (Ganer et al., 2009).  The risk is highest if the IUD is not removed (18%) as 
compared to if the IUD is removed (14%); t he risk in the general population is around 7%.  
Additionally, pregnancies that continue are also at a higher risk of being complicated by 
[CONTACT_697259]; 7% if the IUD remains, 4% if the IUD is removed, and slightly less than 1% in 
the general populatio n (Ganer et al., 2009).  It is unknown whether these risks are similar for 
women who conceive while using a LNG IUS.

7.1.7 Perforation  
The incidence of uterine perforation during a LNG20 IUS placement attempt in the M360 -L102 
study is  0.1%  (Eisenberg et al., 2015) .  Perforation mana gement is outlined in Appendix G. 
7.1.8 Pelvic/Abdominal Pain  
Some women experience pelvic pain or cra mpi[INVESTIGATOR_697219] a small percentage notice 
continued or intermittent pain with continued use of LNG20  IUS.  Pain may be due to uterine 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (perhaps related to placement  or the presence of the IUS ) or functional ovarian cysts.  
However, there i s no clear data on whether the incidence of functional ovarian cysts is increased 
in LNG20 IUS users as compared to the general population.  In the M360 -L102, ovarian cysts 
over multiple years of use are reported in 4.5% of women and discontinuation for ov arian 
functional cysts occurred in only 0.3%  (Teal et al., 2019) .

7.1.10  Mortality   
The risk of death with IUD use ranges from 1 to 6 per million users per year.  This rate is low er 
than all other female methods of contraception and lower than use of no contraception when 
considering the risk of pregnancy (Harlap et al., 1991).

result in infection or uterine perforation.  
7.1.15  Vaginal Ultrasound  
A formal vaginal ultrasound examination will be performed for women at screening (if not 
performed within the last 6 months), if a subject has missing IUS strings, if a subject becomes 
pregnant, and for other indications that would clinically require such an  examination.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , 
the subject may feel mild discomfort similar to a pelvic examination.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_946420] on IUS treatment through Visit 8/Early D iscontinuation : 
• Immediately obtain a serum quantitative hCG  
• Within [ADDRESS_946421] re turn in 
approximately 1-2 weeks  for an unscheduled visit and repeat ultrasound 
examination  
• Complet e a Pregn ancy Narrative (See Study Reference Manual ) 
If the subject reports a positive pregnancy test on her own (performed at home)  she should be 
seen as soon as possible for a high-sensitivity urine pregnancy test to be performed at the clinic  
and if the test is positive perform the required procedures above.   
For pregnancies occurring before  IUS discontinuation , ultrasonography will also be used to  
verify presence of the IUS in the uterus.   
All confirmed pregnancies occurring during study treatment will be followed to completion.   
Pregnancy outcomes, including normal births, septic abortions, ectopic pregnancies, birth defects, 
and premature delive ries, whenever this information is available, will be obtained.  Pregnancy 
reporting should include a Pregnancy Report Form Case Report Form ( CRF) and Pregnancy 
Outcome CRF.  
Pregnancy management is outlined in Appendix F. 
7.5 Adverse Events Assessments  
During the study, the Investigator or study site personnel will be responsible for querying and 
recording adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), as detailed below.  For the 
Sponsor to fulfill safety assessment obligations the I nvestigator should report all SAEs resulting 
from study participation (e.g., complications resulting from a study -required procedure, such as 
the taking of a blood sample).

causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (that could include a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.   The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the  
event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis 
should be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset  
before the study IUS insertion is considered to be pre -existing and should not be 
documented in the CRF as an AE, but should be recorded as medical history.   
• Any AE (i.e., a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with an onset 
from the beginning of study IUS insertion through Visit 8/Early D iscontinuation  and the 
post-Treatment Phase safety contact (if applicable) should be recorded .   
• All AE s must be recorded regardless of the severity or relationship to study medication.   
• All AEs that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product must be 
reported , whether serious or non -serious.  
• An AE does  include:  
o exacerbation of a pre -existing illness  
o increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]  
o condition occurring after study IUS insertion  
o continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen 
following the start of the study  
• An AE does not  include:  
o medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure may be an adverse event  if 
the condition has worsened since enrolling in the stud y

7.7 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any adverse event occurring within the timeline s specified in 
the protocol that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation  
o The subject was at immediate risk of death  from the event as it occurred  
o Does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with 
greater severity  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o Does not require inclusion of elective surgery; however, any adverse event 
occurring during that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697220]  
o Does not have a requirement to be greater than a twenty -four hour stay; if the 
subject was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209747] a day for treatment or 
observation, the definition of “Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” is met  
o Treatment in an outpatient cli nic or Emergency department does not constitute 
“inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”  
o Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]; if a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, b ased upon appropriate medical 
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_946424] and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at h ome for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 
7.[ADDRESS_946425] be notified within 24 hours of discovery  
and the Investigator determines that an adverse event meets the protocol definition of an SAE.  
Any fatal or life -threatening events s hould be reported immediately by [CONTACT_697260]. 
All SAEs occurring from the beginning of study screening  through Visit 8/Early D iscontinuation 
and the post-Treatment P hase safety contact (if applicable) require reporting to the Sponsor.  
Investi gators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event prior 
to notifying the Sponsor but should provide as much relevant information as immediately 
available.  Further details of the event can be provided as they become avail able.  The procedures 
for reporting SAEs are in the Study Reference Manual.  
• It is very important that the Investigator provides an assessment of the causal relationship 
between the event and the study drug at the time of the initial report (see 7.10.2 for 
Causality definitions)  
• The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply 
with the applicable local regulatory requirements concerning the reporting of SAEs to 
regulatory authorities and the IRB  
7.9 Clinical Laboratory Abnorma lities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse 
Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology) or other abnormal 
assessments (e.g., X -rays, vital signs) per se are not reported as AEs.  However, abnormal 
findings that are deemed clinically significant  (i.e., associated with signs an d/or symptoms or 
requiring therapeutic intervention) must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an

LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 107 
 adverse event (and recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious) as described 
previously.  Clinically significant abnormal labor atory or other abnormal findings that are 
detected after IUS insertion or that are present at baseline and worsen following study IUS 
insertion are included as AEs (and SAEs if serious).   
The Investigator should exercise his or her medical judgment in dec iding whether an abnormal 
laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  A clinically significant 
laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical symptoms may also jeopardize the subject and 
may require intervention to preven t immediate consequences (e.g., a markedly high serum 
potassium concentration may not be accompanied by [CONTACT_284967], yet be of a magnitude to 
require potassium -binding resin administration to prevent such sequelae).  Subjects should 
undergo repeat testing o f clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings as soon as they are 
recognized.

exception is due to data system requirements)  
o Bleeding and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_249209] t erminology -consistent use of adverse event 
terminology is essential for characterization of the product:  
▪ Heavy menstrual bleeding ( increase in flow worse than baseline)  
▪ Irregular  bleeding  (variation in bleeding pattern ) 
▪ Infrequent bleeding (bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_697221])  
▪ Amenorrhea  (no bleeding or spotting)  
▪ Frequent bleeding (too many bleeding/spotting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841])  
▪ Prolonged bleeding (persistent bleeding/spotting)  
7.10.2  Causality  Assessment : Adverse E vent Relationship  
The Investigator’s causality assessment sh ould consider the potential etiologies for the observed 
adverse event.  An adverse event may be related to the study drug, other concomitant 
medications, the underlying disease pathology, intercurrent illness, a procedure performed in the 
course of the stu dy, or another reason.  Among the potential etiologies, the Investigator should 
make a determination based on the most likely causal relationship.  When a causality assessment 
is provided for a serious adverse event, it is important to include a rationale for the assessment so 
that a better understanding of the reported event can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602].  The rationale should be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_209789], including relevant laboratory tests, 
histopathology evaluations and the results of other dia gnostic procedures.  The Investigator’s 
rationale with supporting evidence is valuable when the Sponsor performs a cumulative analysis 
of similar events.  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to the study IUS or the IUS insertion or 
remov al procedures by [CONTACT_697261]:  
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 107 
 • Not Related : A causal relationship between the study IUS/procedures and the AE can be 
ruled out (e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a reasonable 
pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause).  
• Unlikely related : A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to IUS insertion or the onset of an IUS insertion or removal 
procedure which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, 
chemicals or underlying  disease provide plausible explanations.  
• Probably Related : A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to IUS insertion or the onset of an IUS insertion or removal 
procedure, unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_697262].  
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
• Related:  A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to IUS insertion or the onset of an IUS insertion or removal procedure, cannot 
be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a 
clinically reasonable response on withdrawal.  
7.10.3  Adverse Event Severity  
The Investigator will assess the severity of the AE using the following gene ral guidelines:  
• Mild:  An AE that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities  
• Moderate :  An AE that introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject 
and may interfere wi th daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_39508]  
• Severe :  An AE that interrupts a subject’s usually daily activity and typi[INVESTIGATOR_697222] (a severe AE may not necessarily qualify as a 
SAE) 
• Life-threatening :  An AE that put the subject at immediate risk of death  from the event 
as it occurred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had 
occurred with greater severity .

M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 107 
 7.10.4  Adverse Event Outcome  
The Investigator will categorize the outcome of each Adverse Event according to the definitions 
below:  
• Resolved:  The subject recovered from the AE   
• Resolved with sequelae  / Stable : A condition whereby [CONTACT_40770] a disease or 
injury include lingering e ffects  that are not worsening  
• Ongoing:  At the time of the last assessment, the event is ongoing, with an undetermined 
outcome.  Note: Ongoing AEs are not considered resolved as a result of death and no AE 
stop date should be recorded for an AE that is ongo ing at the time of death . 
• Fatal: Adverse Event directly caused death.  The Sponsor may request that the Investigator 
perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations.  If a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the 
Sponsor should be provided with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology . 
• Unknown:  The outcome is not known and cannot otherwise be categorized  (e.g., subject 
became lost to follow -up (LTFU ) or withdrew consent)  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on the signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented 
as the AE (and SAE if serious) and not the i ndividual signs/symptoms.  
In the case of abnormal labs or diagnostic tests judged to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786] a diagnosis, if known, or clinical signs or symptoms if the diagnosis is unknown, 
rather than the clinically significant labo ratory finding or abnormal assessment, should be used to 
complete the AE/SAE page.  If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs or symptoms are not 
present, then the abnormal finding should be recorded on the AE/SAE page.  If an SAE report is 
completed, pe rtinent laboratory data should be recorded on the SAE form, preferably with 
baseline values and copi[INVESTIGATOR_284944].  
7.11 Clarification of Action Taken with  IUS 
The Investigator will categorize the Action Taken with IUS according to the definitions bel ow: 
• None:   The IUS was not removed  as result of the Adverse Event   
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_946427]  
o IUS was removed at the time of the AE but due to : 
▪ A different AE  
▪ A different  reason  
▪ The subject wanting the IUS removed because of the AE despi[INVESTIGATOR_697223] a reason to have the IUS removed  
o IUS was already removed prior to the AE start date  
o AE was a full expulsion  
o subject was LTFU  or withdrew consent prior to IUS removal  
• IUS Removed for Non -Safety Reasons : The IUS was remove d for an Adverse Event 
even though the IUS could have remained in place without placing the subject at 
immediate risk for a serious complication  related to the IUS  
• IUS Removed for Safety Reasons : The IUS was removed for an Adverse Event because 
the subject  was at immediate risk for a serious complication as a direct result of the AE if 
the IUS had not been removed  
• Unknown :  The IUS was removed by [CONTACT_425405]  
7.12 Clarification of “Other Action Taken”  
The investigator will indicate the specific treatment provided as a result of the Adverse Event (this 
does not include diagnostic tests or refer rals). 
7.[ADDRESS_946428] event that occurs from the beginning of the IUS insertion procedure until 
completion of insertion, or from the beginning of the removal procedure until the completion of 
removal, will be reported as an AE.  Bleeding and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/ pain occurring during IUS insertion 
or removal will be recorded on the IUS Insertion and Removal CRF s, as appropriate .  Any other 
insertion or removal AEs should be recorded on the AE CRF with a causality assessment of 
“related to IUS procedure.”  If any AE meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event, even if it 
is recorded on the diary or Insertion or Removal CRF, it should also be reported on the AE and 
SAE CRFs and submitted to Sponsor .   
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_946429] to follow -up (including withdrawal of 
consent).  The Investigator is responsible to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or 
causality of the AE/SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathologic examinations, or consultation with other hea lth care professionals.  Follow -up 
information should be submitted to the Sponsor in a timely many as the information is obtained.  
7.[ADDRESS_946430] deaths (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be reported that oc cur from 
the signing informed consent  through declaring the subject as a screen failure or Visit 8/Early 
Discontinuation  and the post-Treatment P hase safety contact (if applicable) .  The information 
should be recorded on the Subject Death form and the SAE form.   
Death is an outcome of an adverse event and not an adverse event itself.  All reports of subject 
death should include an a dverse event term (other than “d eath”) for the cause of the death.  Since 
reporting of an SAE is required  within 24 hours of discovery, d eath can be reported as an initial 
event term and updated to the final diagnosis in a follow -up report.  If an adverse event term is 
not provided, the Investigator will be queried to obtain the cause of death.  Only in the r are 
occurrence that no verbatim description of an adverse event can be obtained from the 
investigative site will “Death – Unknown Cause” be used as the event term.  
7.[ADDRESS_946431] should be withdrawn f rom 
treatment (removal of study IUS) : 
• Subjects may choose to discontinue IUS use at any time during the study  
• Subjects who become pregnant during study participation will have the IUS removed   
o Subjects who become pregnant during study treatment will cont inue to be followed 
until pregnancy completion or termination to determine health -related outcomes of 
the pregnancy  
o The Investigator  will provide pregnancy outcome information as a follow up to the 
initial pregnancy reporting form  
• When IUS  perforation occurs during insertion or while on treatment, the IUS will be 
removed and the subject will be discontinued  
• Subjects who experience an IUS expulsion (partial or complete ) unless a second study IUS 
can be inserted within 2 weeks (one -time only)  and reinsertion occurs at least 7 days prior to 
and not during  either treatment Cycle 3 or Cycle 6  
• The Investigator or Sponsor may discontinue a subject from treatment for other reasons.  
These may include, but are not limited to, the following:   
o Noncompliance with return visit schedule, diary completion, or use of an excluded 
therapy  
o A clinically significant IUS -related adverse event or the development of a new 
significant medical condition that compromises the subject’s ability to participate in 
the study  
o Determination that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue treatment  
7.17.[ADDRESS_946432] should be withdrawn from the 
study:   
• A subject may withdraw consent for further participation in the study at any time without 
giving a reason

M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 of 107 
 • A subject may choose to stop participation in the study for any reason.  If the subject has 
not withdrawn consent and has an IUS in place they should be brought in for IUS 
removal and have appropriate safety follow -up procedures .  
• A subject may also be discontinued from the study at the request of the  Investigator  or the 
Sponsor.  If the subject has an IUS in place they should be brought in for removal and 
have  appropriate safety follow -up procedures .   
• Sponsor decision to terminate the study or discontinue the investigative site’s 
participation  
Reason s for subject withdrawal from the study should be documented in the subject's file and 
entered into the CRF.  
Subjects that are designated as withdrawn from the study, lost to follow -up or who withdraw 
consent may not re -enter the study  and no further data collection will occur . 
7.17.[ADDRESS_946433] that has given consent to participate in the study (i.e. 
signed an Informed Consent  Form) and subsequently was not enrolled for IUS insertion . 
7.17.4  Missed Visits/Contacts and Lost  to Follow Up  
All reasonable efforts should be made to ensure that subjects in screening and enrolled subjects 
return to the investigational site for all study visits. Once a s ubject  is designated as lost to follow -
up, no additional information is to be o btained on any outcomes and no further study -related 
activities are to be conducted , even if the subject later resumes contact . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  During Screening  
Any subject who misses a scheduled visit should have further contact [CONTACT_697263]:  
• At least three documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_363843], e -mail or similar 
mode of communication

Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 of 107 
 • If the subject cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], or is contact[CONTACT_697264] a scheduled 
visit, a certified letter must be sent to th e subject indicating that she will be considered a 
screen failure (lost to follow -up) and cannot continue in the study  
[IP_ADDRESS]  After Enrollment  
Any subject who misses a scheduled visit should have further contact [CONTACT_697263]:  
• At least th ree documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_363843], e -mail or similar 
mode of communication  
• If the subject cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], or is contact[CONTACT_697264] a scheduled 
visit, a certified letter must be sent to the subject indicating  the importance of follow -up 
and instructed to contact [CONTACT_29261]  
• If subject contact [CONTACT_697265] a missed Visit [ADDRESS_946434] the site 
immed iately. The letter should indicate that failure to reply within 30 days of the 
letter date will result in study discontinuation and no future study -related 
activities will be provided.  Certified letters do not need to be sent for subsequent 
missed study visits if a previous delivery attempt was unsuccessful  (letter returned 
or accepted with no subsequent response) . 
A subject should be considered lost to follow -up when : 
• A subject in the Treatment P hase does not report for V8  
• The safety follow -up contact (if applicable) is missed and three documented contacts and 
a certified letter do not result in subject contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_946435] documents her 
withdrawal of consent in writing.   
 DATA QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
Electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs) for this study will be designed and provided by 
  [CONTACT_697266].   will be responsible for data management of this trial, including quality checking 
of CRFs.  In the event of incomplete or inconsistent data, requests for data correction will be sent 
to the sites for resolution.  A complete audit trail of changes to the data will be maintained and 
available from the clinical trial database.  Laboratory data (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit, ferritin , 
chemistry, quan titative hCG, urine pregnancy, Chlamydia, gonorrhea , FSH, TSH, PRL, vWF, 
ALT , AST ) will be collected util izing the site’s local accredited laboratory  (unless performing 
CLIA -waived tests ).  The site  will enter the lab oratory  values for subjects in the clinical trial 
electronic database.  The Data Management Plan will describe the quality check s that will be 
performed on the CRFs and the electronic data.  CRFs and correction documentation  will be 
converted to pdf format  and bookmarked for index ing.  Records retention for study data will be 
consistent with  standard procedures.  Routine system backup and archiving will also 
be performed based on  standard procedures.  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable FDA guidances and regulations . 
 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
The following statistical methods will be used to assess the efficacy and safety of LNG20  IUS 
for the treatment of HMB .  Prior to implementing the analysis a detailed statistical analysis plan 
will be written.  

Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 79 of 107 
 9.1 Sample Size  
Eligible subjects 18 -50 years of age will include approximately 100 subjects using L NG20  IUS.  
The s ample size estimate is based on results from previous studies with similar endpoints as well 
as the goal of a lower 95% confidence around the point estimate of the primary outcome with 
acceptable precision, i.e., being no more than 10% lowe r than the point estimate. The estimation 
of the required number of subjects needed to evaluate the efficacy of the LNG20  IUS is based on 
the following assumptions:  
• The expected successful treatment rate is estimated to be 80% or higher  
• The lower bound of  95% confidence interval should be within 10% from the point 
estimate, i.e., 70% or higher to establish the efficacy of LNG20  IUS for the treatment of 
HMB  
• Early discontinuations due to dropouts, IUS expulsions, pregnancies and other reasons 
will not exceed  15% 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_946436] 71.5% lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for 
an expected successful treatment rate of 80% or higher based on normal approximation. 
Therefore, [ADDRESS_946437] populations will be created:  
• Safety (Safety) :  All subjects enrolled who underwent the IUS insertion p rocedure, 
regardless of outcome.  
• Modified -Intent -To-Treat (MITT) :  All subjects at study entry for whom the IUS is 
successfully placed in the uterus with valid baseline data and for whom there is at least 
one assessment of MBL  during the treatment phase . 
• Per Protocol (PP) :  A subset of the MITT population that excludes subjec ts with major 
protocol deviations (to be identified prior to data lock).  
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_946438] (any prescription 
medications or over -the-counter preparations) taken during the screening phase through the 
active study treatment phase.  Pre -trial medications include any medications taken within seven 
days (30 days  for anticoagulants) of Screening Visit 1 .  The number and percentage of subjects 
using medications, as captured on the Concomitant Medication CRF form, will be tabulated 
according to the medication’s World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Drug Class 
and Generic Name  [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_6654].  Pre -trial and concomitant medications will 
be presented separately.  
9.7 Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome measure will  be the proportion  of subjects with successful treatment of 
heavy menstrual bleeding based on the decrease in MBL from baseline to 6 months (during the 
sixth 28 -day cycle) after initial LNG20  IUS insertion. This outcome will be established in the 
Modified -Intent -To-Treat (MITT) population measuring the change in absolute value from 
baseline MBL to the end of treatment MBL. Baseline MBL is the MBL averaged over each of 
the cycles measured during the Screening Phase. A subject with successful treatment will b e 
defined as:  
• the end of treatment MBL <80 mL, and  
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 of 107 
 • a decrease to a value of no greater than 50% of the baseline MBL  
The primary outcome measure will be analyzed with 95%  confidence interval based on normal 
approximation. The efficacy of LNG20  IUS for the t reatment of heavy menstrual bleeding will 
be established in this study if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval equals or exceeds 
70%.  
9.8 Key Secondary Outcomes  
All key secondary outcomes will be summarized by [CONTACT_697267]/or spotting analyses will be summarized using both Safety 
and MITT Populations.

• Percent change from baseline MBL to mid -treatment MBL ( Cycle 3)  
• Absolute change from  baseline to end of treatment (Cycle 6)  
• Percent change from baseline MBL to end of treatment MBL ( Cycle 6)  
• Changes from baseline to mid -treatment ( Cycle 3), from mid -treatment ( Cycle 3) to end 
of treatment ( Cycle 6) and from baseline to  end of treatment ( Cycle 6) in the number of 
days of bleeding, spotting, bleeding and spotting and number of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  
9.9 Other Secondary Outcomes  
All other secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the Safety Population unless noted 
otherwise.  
• Percen t change in hemoglobin, hematocrit and serum ferritin from baseline to mid -treatment 
(Visit 7 ), from baseline to end of treatment (Visit  8 ) and from mid -treatment ( Visit 7 ) to end 
of treatment ( Visit 8 )

• IUS Safety -Related Removal Rates  
o Cumulative IUS safety -related removal rates at Treatment Phase Visit 6, Visit 7 
and Visit 8 will b e summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods  
• Vaginal Bleeding Flow  
o Vaginal bleeding flow  (none, spotting, and light, normal, or heavy flow 
[bleeding]) will be summarized by [CONTACT_697269] .  Vaginal 
bleeding is recorded on the daily diary during the Screening Phase  and baseline 
will be considered the worst flow severity  during the screening cycles .   
▪ Based on World Health Organization ( WHO ) terminology, bleeding and 
spotting are defined as:  
- Bleeding: any bloody vaginal discharge for which protection, such 
as pads is used  
- Spotting: any bloody vaginal discharge for which protection is not 
used (for women who use mini pads for daily protection, extra 
protection is not required); if spotting and bl eeding occur on the 
same day, it is recorded as a bleeding day  
o Vaginal Bleeding Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]

 APPENDIX F: MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY  
Among women who conceive with an IUS in situ , the spontaneous abortion rate is two -fold 
higher than that of the general obstetric population.  A retained IUS also increases the risk of 
several late gestational adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes; this risk is reduced, but not 
eliminated, with early removal of the IUS.    
For any subject who has a posit ive urine pregnancy test, the pregnancy should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_697280].  The location of the pregnancy must be determined 
(intrauterine or extrauterine ) using ultrasonography .  Determine the location of the IUS using 
physical examination, ultrasonography and/or radiography as appropriate.  
 
1. Management of intrauterine pregnancy with IUS in place  
The following steps may be considered in the evaluation and management of intrauterine 
pregnancy in a subject with an IUS in situ : 
• First trimester intrauterine pregnancy:  
o If the IUS strings are visible on speculum examination, remove the IUS to 
decrease the risk of subsequent miscarriage and infection.  Antibiotics are 
unnecessary.  
o If the strings are not visible and the patient wishes to continue the pregnancy, 
remove the IUS under ultrasound guidance using an alligator forceps or an IUS 
hook.  Removal can also be attempted by [CONTACT_697281].  Data on hysteroscopic 
removal of IUS in early pregnancy are limited; therefore, it is not clear whether 
this technique poses greater o r lesser risk of pregnancy loss than instrument 
removal under ultrasound guidance.  Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended 
when instrument removals are performed during pregnancy, including when IUS 
removal is to be followed by [CONTACT_697282] (see be low).  The IUS may be 
left in situ  if findings on ultrasound examination suggest removal will be difficult 
or disrupt the pregnancy (e .g., IUS embedded in the placenta or membranes).  
o If the woman desires pregnancy termination, IUS removal can be performed  at the 
time of the termination.  Manual or electric vacuum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_697233], alligator forceps, ring forceps, or ovum forceps can be used 
to remove the IUS.  
Medicines360  
LNG20  IUS Clinical Study Protocol  
M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_946460], it is re commended to 
remove the IUS and prescribe antibiotics (e .g., doxycycline  100 mg twice a day or 
ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]  500 mg four times a day for seven days).  
• Second trimester pregnancy —Counsel subject  if the IUS remains in situ , that there is an 
increased risk of preterm labor and delivery (fourfold increase), second trimester fet al 
loss, and infection, but no proven increase in risk of birth defects.  Removal of the IUS 
may cause rupture of membranes, bleeding, pregnancy loss, or fetal trauma; however, if 
the IUS is removed or expelled without complications, there is no increased risk of 
miscarriage.  
o Given this information, for pregnancies after 12 weeks, consider removing the 
IUS by [CONTACT_697283] (based upon ultrasound localization of the IUS 
and placenta).  
o If the strings are not visible in the early second trimester, the IUS may be 
removed under ultrasound guidance if removal appears feasible, the IUS is not 
located behind the placenta, and it does not appear to be incorporated into t he 
gestational sac.  In particular, ultrasound guided removal is recommended in these 
cases if the IUS is in the lower uterine segment. If the IUS appears embedded in 
the placenta, located behind the placenta, or protrudes into the gestational sac, we 
sugg est leaving the IUS in situ . 
o In the later second trimester, if the strings are not visible, the IUS should be left in 
place. The subject should be counseled that her risk of spontaneous abortion and 
premature delivery is increased relative to women whose I USs may be ea sily 
removed.  
2. Management of intrauterine pregnancy with extrauterine IUS  
• If the IUS was expelled, the pregnancy should be managed as any other intrauterine 
pregnancy . 
• If the IUS is extrauterine (perforation), the pregnancy should be managed without removal 
of the IUS until after the pregnancy is complete or, if applicable, at the time of cesarean 
delivery .

 3. Management of extrauterine pregnancy  
• Management should be perfo rmed within the local standard of care for the extrauterine 
pregnancy.  
• If the IUS is intrauterine, the IUS should be removed and the subject discontinued from the 
study following appropriate safety follow -up.

 APPENDIX G: MANAGEMENT OF IUS ISSUES  
1. Difficult Insertion  
If insertion is difficult because the cervix cannot be properly visualized then the subject should 
have been excluded prior to randomization.  
• If insertion is difficult because the uterus cannot be instrumented, the following measures 
are allowed:  
o Use of cervical anesthesia to make sounding and manipulation more tolerable  
o Use of rigid dilators to dilate the cervix if needed to allow passage of the sound.  
If needed, a lacrimal duct probe or os finder may be used to start dilation.   
o Abdominal ultrasound guidance during dilation and/or insertion.  
If the uterus still cannot be appropriately instrumented after the above measures are taken, 
or the uterus sounds to less than 5.5cm, then the subject should be considered an insertion 
failure  and discontinued from the study.  No further follow -up or visits are required.  
2. Perforation  
• Perforation may occur during insertion. The risk of perforation is increased in women 
with fixed retroverted uteri, during lactation, and postpartum.  If during or after insertion 
there is clinical concern or exceptional pain or bleeding, appropriate and timely measures 
and assessments, such as ultrasound, should be performed to exclude perforation.  
• Perforation or penetration of the uterine wall or cervix may occur d uring insertion 
although the perforation may not be detected until sometime later.  The IUS must be 
located and removed; surgery may be required. Delayed detection of perforation may 
result in migration outside the uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, i ntestinal 
perforations, intestinal obstruction, abscesses and erosion of adjacent viscera.  Ensure a 
radiographic image of the entire abdomen is obtained to ensure the IUS hasn’t migrated.   
• If recognized and the IUS is intra -abdominal, a laparoscopy shoul d be performed by a 
clinician experienced in such procedures to remove the IUS.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], minimal 
adhesions are present with intra -abdominal IUSs.  If necessary, a laparotomy should be 
performed.  
If the IUS is partially into or through the myometrium, it  is reasonable to attempt removal 
with transcervical instrumentation.  Initial attempts s hould be performed under ultrasound

 guidance using an Alligator forceps (or similar instrument).  If unsuccessful, attempts via 
hysteroscopy should be made before proc eeding to laparoscopy.  
3. Missing Strings  
The site should check for the IUS strings by [CONTACT_697284].  
Ultrasound examination to verify the IUS is in place cannot substitute for checking the strings.   
If the strings ar e not evident on exam follow these steps, moving to the next one if unsuccessful:  
• Use endobrush in cervical canal to attempt to tease down string.  
• Perform a transvaginal ultrasound examination to locate the IUS.  If the IUS is confirmed 
to be present in th e uterus and the strings are missing, then transvaginal ultrasonography 
should be performed at all follow -up visits to confirm presence of the IUS.  
• Obtain a flat plate abdominal x -ray to check if the IUS is within the abdomen.  
o If it is not visible on abdominal x -ray, the case will be considered a spontaneous 
expulsion.  
o If it is visible on x -ray, but not within the uterus on ultrasound, the case will be 
considered a perforation.  The patient should then be referred, as necessary, for 
IUS removal by [CONTACT_697285], and for any other necessary care.  
• Subjects who experience IUS expulsion  may have another study IUS inserted ; only one 
replacement IUS is allowed per subject. Replacement can occur only if all of the 
following conditions are met:   
o Reinsertion occurs no more than 14 days after the expulsion;  
o Reinsertion occurs at least 7 days prior to treatment Cycle 3 or Cycle 6;  
o Reinsertion cannot occur during treatment Cycle 3 or Cycle 6;  
o Pregnancy can reasonably be excluded . 
4. Partial E xpulsion  
Define d as visual evidence of the lower portion of the IUS stem protruding through the cervical 
os OR evidence of increased bleeding and/or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_697234].  The system can be expelled from the uterin e cavity without the 
woman noticing it, resulting in the loss of contraceptive protection. As menstrual flow typi[INVESTIGATOR_697235] 3 to 6 months of IUS use, an increase of menstrual flow may be 
indicative of an expulsion.

M360 -L105  
 
Version 4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 105 of 107 
 • The IUS should be re moved  as soon as possible .   
• Subjects who experience a partial IUS expulsion may have another study IUS inserted 
(see criteria in #3 above)  
5. Infection  
• Patients must be taught to recognize and report to their physician promptly any symptoms 
of pelvic inflammatory disease.  These symptoms include development of menstrual 
disorders (prolonged or heavy bleeding), unusual vaginal discharge, abdominal or pelvic 
pain or tenderness, dyspareunia, chills, and fever.  Following a diagnosis of PID, or 
suspected P ID, bacteriologic specimens should be obtained and antibiotic therapy should 
be initiated promptly.  
• Any woman treated by a medical professional for uterine infection/PID will be 
considered to have that diagnosis.  At a minimum, uterine tenderness must be present.  
The IUS should not be removed when such a diagnosis is made unless the infection is 
refractory to antibiotic therapy or the subject has a pelvic abscess or sepsis.  
6. Difficult R emoval  
If the IUS cannot be removed by [CONTACT_697286] s, first ma ke sure the clinician is certain the 
IUS is still in the uterus.  Embedment can result in difficult removal and, in some cases surgical 
removal may be necessary.  An embedded IUS should be removed.  Embedment may decrease 
contraceptive effectiveness and re sult in pregnancy.  Once certain the IUS is in the uterus, 
consider any of the following options alone or in combination:  
• Abdominal ultrasound guidance  
• Cervical anesthesia to make manipulation more tolerable  
• IUD thread retriever  
• Alligator forceps (or compa rable instrument)  
If the IUS still cannot be removed in an office setting using the above techniques, hysteroscopic 
evaluation for removal should be performed.  
After removal of the IUS, verify that the system is intact.  If the system is not intact, any missing 
parts must be located and removed.  If removal of missing parts cannot be completed in the office, 
contact [CONTACT_697287].  As a reminder, all removed 
IUSs should be collected and stored in a temperature controlled freezer.

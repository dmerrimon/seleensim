1.0 Background and Introduction : 
 
Cosmetic satisfaction has become increasingly important in modern era especially for elective surgical 
procedures (1). While p ostoperative scarring is inevitable , improved scar treatment and prevention has the 
potential to improve  a patient’s health -related quality  of life (2). Although there are multiple scar 
assessment scales,  but five most frequently used scales are: Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS ), Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS ) and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS ), Manchester Scar 
Scale (MSS) and Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES)(3). 
 
We will be using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for our study. For this study scar assessment will be 
performed by [CONTACT_855649] a larger group of assessors and eligible 
patients than would be possible with in- person assessment. The patient will also be asked to provide 
assessment based on these parameters. Evaluators will be physicians including medical students, 
residents, fellows, and attending surgeons.   
   
Our main aim of th is study is to evaluate the difference in  cosmetic outcomes for patients whose post -
operative wound was treated with hydrocolloid dressing vs petrolatum ointment (Vaseline) after excision 
or M ohs surgery for cutaneous malignancy  or other cutaneous conditions that require surgical 
intervention. Scar cosmesis will be assessed using the VAS.   
 
 
2.0 Objective: 
 2.1 Primary Objective  
 
1) To determine the difference in scar cosmesis using a hydrocolloid dressing vs petrolatum jelly 
after Mohs surgery  or conventional excision.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objective:  
 
2) To compare the complication  rate in patients using a hydrocolloid dressing vs petrolatum jelly 
after Mohs surgery  or conventional excision. 
 
 3.0 Outcome measures:  
 
 3.1 Primary outcome measure:  
         
• Both the patient and external evaluators (residents, Mohs fellow, other surgeons)  will score the 
outcome of the scar based on the  VAS. External evaluators will assess and score the scar by 
[CONTACT_42574] a high-quality photograph taken 7 days , 30 days  and 90 days  after surgery .  
 
 
3.2 Secondary outcome measure:  
 
• Complication rate  including hematoma, seroma, wound infection requiring antibiotics, opening 
and drainage of wound, dehiscence. Complications will be assessed by [CONTACT_855650].

4.0 Eligibility Criteria:  
 
4.1   Inclusion Criteria:  
  
1) Adult > 18 years of age  
2) Linear scars  
3) Patients underwent conventional excision or Mohs micrographic surgery for primary cutaneous 
cancer or other cutaneous condition that require d surgical intervention  
      
4.2 Exclusion Criteria:  
   
1) Age < 18 years of age  
2) Scar localization on acral or hair bearing sites  
3) Patients unable to converse in English  
4) Patients requiring flap or graft for closure of wound  
5) History of allergy to adhesives  
6) Patient using topi[INVESTIGATOR_855648] 3 
months after surgery  
7) Use of h ydrocolloid dressings for post -operative wound care in the past  
  5.0 Study Design: 
 
• Subjects >[ADDRESS_1191784]. Syril Keena Que 
 
• After informed consent  is signed , patients will be  randomized either to receive standard daily 
dressing or hydrocolloid dressing using a randomization generator . After closing the wound with 
the sutures, the scar will be covered by a hydrocolloid dressing, which will be left in place for 7 
days (Experimental) or  the standard dressing  (Control) that will be covered with petrolatum jelly  
and bandaging during this time period, which has to be re-applied daily .  
 
• Patients will be followed up at 7, 30 and 90 days after surgery for photographic scar evaluation by [CONTACT_855651] . 
 
• Variables recorded: name, DOB, s ex, contact [CONTACT_3031], primary cutaneous condition  
diagnoses , anatomic site, pathologic report , postoperative scar length, postoperative 
complications, patient VAS scores, and  external evaluator (physician or medical student)  VAS  
scores. External evaluators will be blinded as to the side treated with hydrocolloid dressings. 
One week after undergoing the procedure, patients will be contact[CONTACT_855652] (other than the primary surgeon) and will be asked for their responses to the  Modified 
Bluebelle Q uestionnaire . Version 1 of this questionnaire is for patients who received 
conventional dressing and version 2 for patients who received hydrocolloid dressing.
 Patients 
will be given the option to mail back a paper version of the completed survey, if they prefer.  
 
• Data will be captured in Redcap and exported in excel file for statistical analysis.  
V 10.6.2022  
• Statistical tests: Will be performed with the assistance of an  experienced biostatistic ian. 
 
 
    
 
     
 
 
   
 
     
 
    
 
     
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
    Recruitment of initial subject pool  
Inclusion of consecutive patients that present to IU Meridian Crossing clinic with primary cutaneous cancer.  
Initial screening and consent  
Conduct baseline assessment, provide study materials, etc.  
• Subjects who will qualify for inclusion receive a copy of their signed authorization 
for release of health information form and a copy of the signed informed consent 
form 
• Any questions from the subject will be answered by [CONTACT_25715] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator.  
 
Scar Covering  
• After the placement of sutures,  the scar  will be covered by [CONTACT_855653], 
which will be left in place for 1 week (Experimental) or with petrolatum jelly, which 
will be re -applied by [CONTACT_855654] 1 week .  
• A randomization generator will be used to determine which wound  is treated with 
hydrocolloid dressing. The study will be conducted until there is an equal number in each arm.

    6.0 Enrollment/Randomization 
 
Participants will be identified by [CONTACT_855655] n or Mohs surgery. 
After a discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, if the patients choose to undergo surgical excision 
via conventional excision or Mohs , they will be given the option to participate in this study. After 
explaining the study, patient consent will be taken on the day of surgery.  
One week after surgery,  patients will be followed up either in clinic or contact[CONTACT_855656]. Patients will also be given an option to complete the questionnaire via email, if they 
prefer.   All surgical procedures and physical interventions will be conducted as part of standard clinical care. The 
only element performed as part of research is collection of survey data relating to scar assessment and 
satisfaction.  
 7.0 Reportable Events  
 All adverse events or deviations of the protocol will be documented as per date, reason and all deviation 
will be presented to the clinical trials team and communicated to the IRB committee as required per institutional policies and federal regulations.  
 8.0 Data Safety Monitoring  
 
This is a minimal risk study and data will be stored in a secure database to ensure patient privacy and 
confidentiality.  
 9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 Patients may withdraw from the study at any time on the day of their procedure by [CONTACT_855657]. Incomplete surveys will be collected and destroyed. 
Patients may be withdrawn from the study if they meet any exclusion criteria that were not immediately apparent at time of enrollment.  
  
10.[ADDRESS_1191785] size of 0.2. With an alpha value of 0.05, the study will require 100 patients to achieve this statistical power. A 95% confidence interval will be used to 
determine significance.   
Any feasible potential outliers have been identified and will be included in the survey and statistical 
analysis. Statisticians will provide ongoing assistance with data analysis throughout the study.  
  11.[ADDRESS_1191786] system,  which will be incorporated into the Excel sheet or REDCap workbook, as needed.  
Quality assurance steps will include: testing of database by [CONTACT_524052].  The following quality control methods will be used: extraction and cleaning of data that will be 
used for analysis every 3 months.  
 
12.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 All patient identifying information (name, MRN, phone number, skin cancer type, date of surgery, etc .) 
collected in this study will be deidentified prior to data analysis. All written records will be converted to a computerized database and subsequently destroyed.

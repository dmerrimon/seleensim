 7 PRÉCIS   Study Title  GET Living: Graded Exposure Treatment for Adolescents with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Objectives  Reducing elevated pain-related fear promotes participation in daily activities1-4. When patients experience how disengagement from safety behaviors does not lead to catastrophic consequences, their misinterpretations are challenged and disconfirmed, enabling them to correct their fear expectancies5-7. GET Living is the first program to explicitly targeted pain-related fear and associated disability in adolescents. Currently, most rehabilitative treatments for adolescents with chronic pain involve promoting pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_841859]. Unfortunately, the debilitating influence of pain-related fear can stymy progress in both domains resulting in continued high healthcare utilization without symptomatic improvement. Design and Outcomes   This study will be a randomized control trial (RCT) including approximately [ADDRESS_1169779] Children’s Health (SCH).  A “participant” in this study is defined as a child and at least one parent. The term “patient” is used to describe the child participant only. Participants will attend an initial baseline assessment (BAS) to perform consent/asset, undergo a biomechanical assessment by [CONTACT_841895], and complete self-report questionnaires. Child participants will also be given an Actigraph and will be introduced to the daily diaries. Following BAS, participants will undergo a pre-treatment baseline period where daily diaries will be collected and Actigraphy monitoring will occur. After the baseline period, participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group, Graded Exposure Therapy (GET Living) or Typi[INVESTIGATOR_841860] (TPM) stratified on their fear and disability scores. Participants in the GET Living intervention group (n=37) will engage in 1-hour sessions of GET Living for [ADDRESS_1169780]. Participants randomized into the TPM treatment group (n = 37) will engage in 6 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy and 6 sessions of physical therapy following BAS. Parents enrolled into the TPM arm will engage in 3 parent-only sessions with the child’s cognitive-behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. All participants complete a Daily Diary during treatment.  At treatment discharge for the GET Living intervention group and TPM treatment, participants will undergo a second biomechanical assessment and complete self-report questionnaires. After completion of the second assessment evaluation, participants are contact[CONTACT_51095]-up evaluation, which includes completion of the Daily Diary for a 7-day window and self-report questionnaires at each follow-up time point ([ADDRESS_1169781]-second assessment).  Interventions and Duration  The GET Living intervention will be compared to Typi[INVESTIGATOR_841860] (TPM) provided at Stanford Children’s Health. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for up to 40 weeks – Starting with the BAS visit, 2 weeks (on average) of a pre-treatment baseline period, approximately [ADDRESS_1169782]-discharge follow-up. (See Figure 3 for a break-down of the study milestones and expected timeline.)  Sample Size and Population  An ideal recruitment site, Stanford houses a tertiary care pediatric pain management treating approximately 300 unique patients in the clinic each year. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be informed of the study by [CONTACT_841896] a study brochure. We aim to recruit a total of 74 participants into the study.  
 
 8 1.1 Primary Objective 1a. To evaluate pain-related fear outcomes between GET Living and TPM. Hypotheses: Compared to TPM, the GET Living group will (1) have significantly less pain-related fear avoidance (adolescent, parent) at discharge, with continued gains at 3 and 6-month follow-up; Exploratory: (2) have fewer number of days to pain-related fear avoidance improvement via daily diaries.  1b. To evaluate disability and parent responses to pain outcomes between GET Living and TPM. Hypotheses: Compared to TPM, adolescents receiving GET Living will have (1) significantly less functional disability and protective parent responses at discharge, with continued gains at 3 and 6-month follow-up; Exploratory: (2) fewer number of days to achieve decreased functional disability and protective parent responses, assessed via daily diaries; (3) significantly better adolescent joint kinetics at discharge, assessed via motion analysis; and (4) demonstrate significantly greater increases in daily physical activity levels at discharge via Actigraphy. We will also examine treatment response correlates: age, pain, gender, diagnosis, and readiness to change.  2. To characterize feasibility and acceptability of GET Living compared to TPM to inform implementation of a large multi-site RCT. Hypotheses: GET Living participants will have (1) high treatment satisfaction ratings (mean score ³ 40 of 60; reflective of satisfied or very satisfied); Secondary: (2) ³ 80% sessions completed on-schedule, ≤ 20% attrition rate, ³ 80% adolescent and parent daily diary adherence; Exploratory: (3) fewer health care costs at 3 and 6-month follow-up compared to TPM.  2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Background and Significance Overall Scientific Premise. Chronic musculoskeletal pain in adolescence is a significant public health concern with median prevalence rates of 11 to 38%8,9, with 3 to 5% of adolescents suffering from significant pain-related disability10,11, costing society $19.5 billion annually in the US alone12. Notwithstanding the personal suffering and persistent physical and economic consequences for families, chronic pain in adolescence can predispose the development of adult chronic pain13. Fear avoidance is a particularly salient influence on pain outcomes14-17 and is a risk factor for less treatment responsiveness18.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_841860] (TPM) yields only modest improvements in functional disability and no change in pain-related fear avoidance19. These findings underscore the need to specifically target pain-related fear avoidance in adolescents to potentially avert sustained pain-related disability. Thus, the current exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) tests graded in-vivo exposure treatment (GET) for adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain (GET Living). While TPM focuses on pain control via pain management psychology and impairment-based physical therapy, GET Living is jointly delivered by a pain psychologist and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841861]-injury. Implementing GET Living will represent a significant treatment paradigm shift by [CONTACT_342310] a key mechanism (pain-related fear avoidance) rather than on pain itself. Knowing that RCTs of GET are successful in adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain2,3,20-[ADDRESS_1169783] rehabilitative treatments for adolescents with chronic pain involve promoting pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_841862] 
 
 9 therapy prescribed. Unfortunately, the debilitating influence of pain-related fear can stymy progress in both domains resulting in continued high healthcare utilization without symptomatic improvement.   Scientific premise for addressing pain-related fear in adolescents and parents. Adolescent pain-related fear is associated with disability, depressive symptoms, and school impairment24,25. Recent work has identified that it is equally important to assess and address parental fears. Parent emotional responses serve as key guides to a child’s learning of safety and danger, in turn influencing subsequent behavior26,27. Growing evidence supports parent pain catastrophizing and protective behavior in prioritizing pain control28, higher functional disability29,30 and school dysfunction31 in youth with pain. Building from the Fear Avoidance Model of Pain32-34, we developed and validated the Interpersonal Fear Avoidance Model of Pain (IFAM) (Figure 1)35. Within the IFAM, parents interpret an adolescent’s pain expression through the lens of their own catastrophic appraisals and pain-related fears, and are more likely to engage in maladaptive parenting behaviors (i.e., protective responses), in turn negatively influencing adolescent pain-related function.   Scientific premise for biomechanical assessment and physical activity monitoring. A cycle of fear of movement, activity avoidance, and abnormal movement patterns (kinesics) in adolescents with chronic pain can lead to decreased tolerance to physical activity that persists into adulthood37. Abnormal kinesics, such as asymmetry in range of motion, or timing of muscle activation or joint motions, commonly exist as a compensatory mechanism in (adult) chronic pain38,39 and potentially amplified by [CONTACT_77368]-related fear40. Adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM) have higher fear of movement and greater variability in lower extremity mechanics during gait assessment and drop landing compared to healthy controls37. Moreover, in a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (n=11) of CBT and neuromuscular training in JFM, improvements were observed in walking gait (stride length) and functional performance (drop vertical jump)41. Building from work in JFM, examining biomechanics of gait and functional movements among a diverse group of chronic pain patients in this RCT allows us to precisely define the joint motions and forces that are altered by [CONTACT_229721], and the changes that occur with TPM compared to GET Living.  In order to understand the impact of altered biomechanics observed in the laboratory, this trial includes real world objective physical activity (PA) monitoring via a wrist-worn actigraph. Actigraphy is particularly useful as self-report measures can be prone to response shift and reporter bias42,43. Unlike laboratory-based objective measures of physical activity, such as timed walks and peak oxygen consumption during exercise, actigraphy provides high ecological validity with unobtrusive measurement of activity levels during daily life44. Adolescents with chronic pain have lower mean and peak activity levels compared to healthy peers43. Although changes in physical activity via actigraphy have not been demonstrated for adolescent fibromyalgia patients using cognitive-behavioral therapy alone45, it is hypothesized that the integrated GET Living approach will increase mean and peak physical activity levels.

 10 fear eradication, and (3) providing proof-of-principle of innovative daily tracking and biomechanical measures to define clinical endpoints and assess treatment progress within this clinical trial.     2.2 Study Rationale Preliminary Studies/Progress Report  Over the past [ADDRESS_1169784] US pi[INVESTIGATOR_841863]-vivo exposure for youth with chronic pain (GET Living; NCT:01974791). GET Living was designed in close consultation with Johan Vlaeyen, PhD, developer of GET and consultant on this application. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_841864] a sequential replicated and randomized single-case experimental design with multiple measures with no comparator arm.   Preliminary Clinical Endpoints without Controls. As displayed in Table 1, patients reported significant improvements in disability, fear, avoidance (large effects). Moreover, parent fear, avoidance, and protective behavior were also impacted (large effects). These results suggest that  1) GET Living treatment results in significant improvements in primary (disability) and  secondary/mechanistic (fear, avoidance) endpoints, 2) gains continue at 3 and 6-months follow-up, and 3) this approach is particularly effective for parents on fear, avoidance, and protective behavior. In addition to standard questionnaires, patients complete the Photographs of Daily Activities-Youth English (PHODA-YE)46, a diagnostic tool we validated to determine perceived harmfulness of activities and movements. The PHODA-YE is administered electronically with a photograph for each activity. Treatment providers receive a detailed PHODA-YE report that is shared with the patient to develop an exposure hierarchy prior to the start of exposures. Examining PHODA-YE outcomes (Figure 2), patients report significant decreases in activity-engagement worries (large effect sizes across domains), with largest sports activity engagement improvements. These results suggest that specifically targeting worrisome activities in GET Living treatment results in appreciable improvements at end of treatment that are maintained.  The proposed study focuses on evaluating an innovative treatment adolescents with pain-related disability and fear. GET is successful and empi[INVESTIGATOR_841865]-related fear. However, the efficacy of exposure-based treatment for children with chronic pain has not been tested.  Feasibility and Acceptability Data. A total of 37 patients (Mean age=13.7; 82% female) enrolled. Of the 34 patients who began treatment (3 dropped out during baseline), 28 completed (18% attrition rate) and [ADDRESS_1169785] to follow-up (96% follow-up retention rate). Average duration of treatment for completers was 64 days with an 86% patient daily diary completion rate and 82% for parents. Families also provided feedback at discharge interviews: "My son gained confidence, and I was taught how to support him" (mom), "I can break activities down- it doesn't have Table 1.

 11 to be all or nothing" (patient). Developmentally sensitive modifications. “The word “worry” was used too often.” (mom and dad). Patients also struggled distinguishing between numerical ratings of worry and pain. In response, we developed a rating scale for exposure activities based on W: Willingness, I: Importance, L: Likelihood of Success, and D: Degree of Difficulty (WILD scale). “Diaries became repetitive” (patient). In response, we created multiple versions of the diaries with items in varying order. Families requested ‘copi[INVESTIGATOR_125656]’. In response, we devised exposure action plans (EAP) to increase task persistence (e.g., movement break, music during task).  3. STUDY DESIGN This study employs a two-group randomized, controlled design to test GET Living, for adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain and elevated pain-related fear (Figure 3). Primary outcome is pain-related fear avoidance (adolescent, parent). Secondary outcome is disability. Additional outcomes are parent responses to pain and pain acceptance. Exploratory: adolescent biomechanics and physical activity.  Figure 3. Study Design. a) Eligibility Screening: musculoskeletal pain patients (ages 8-18; pain > 3 months) at Stanford Children’s Health (SCH); b) Baseline Visit (BAS): Consent/Assent, Baseline Assessment: SR, motion analysis; Baseline Daily Diary: DD and actigraphy; c) Randomization: randomization to treatment group; d) GET Living and TPM begin: DD and actigraphy ongoing; e) Discharge Assessment: SR, motion analysis; f) 3-month Follow-Up: SR, 7-day DD, g) 6-month Follow-Up: SR, 7-day DD. Note. DD=daily diary; SR=self-report; W=week.  Recruitment. An ideal recruitment site, Stanford houses a tertiary care pediatric pain management treating approximately 300 unique patients in the clinic each year. We will recruit adolescent patients and a primary parent (N = 74) from the outpatient pediatric pain management clinic (PPMC) at Stanford Children's Health (SCH). We will also recruit patients from Kaiser Permanente Bay Area satellite clinics, contingent upon referrals from pain rehabilitation clinicians. For inclusion, the patients: 1) are 8-18 years old; 2) have musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain (e.g., localized [back, limb], diffuse)47 not due to an acute trauma (active sprain or fracture); 3) have pain-related fear (FOPQ ≥ 35), 4) functional limitations (FDI ≥ 13), and 5) be English language proficient. Patient exclusion criteria are: 1) significant cognitive impairment (e.g., brain injury) and 2) significant medical or psychiatric problem that would interfere with treatment (e.g., seizures, psychosis, suicidality). Identification of Eligibility: Patients and their parents who meet eligibility criteria will be informed of the study by [CONTACT_841896] a study brochure. Additionally, a study flyer will be posted on our bulletin board of all active clinical studies in the patient waiting room. Screening: For each patient referred to the trial, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by [CONTACT_841897], along with the Clinician Referral Checklist (MOOP Supplemental Materials I) and a screening phone call. Study Entry and Randomization: Individuals passing the first two stages will enter the study by [CONTACT_841898] (BAS). Once enrolled, adolescents will be randomized to either GET Living or TPM and stratified on fear (moderate/high; FOPQ-C: low [0-34] moderate [35-49] high [50-96]) and disability (moderate/severe; mild [0-12] moderate [13-29] severe [30-60]48), to minimize the possibility of imbalance between the two treatment arms. To allow the use of small blocks while minimizing the probability of a blinded staff member predicting the next assignment, we will use blocks of size two and four and randomly choose block sizes. The study biostatistician (Derek Boothroyd, PhD) will create separate randomization lists for each of the four strata prior to the start of patient recruitment with each list long enough to include the total planned study size. A series of block sizes (either two or four, with probability weights two thirds and one third respectively) will be randomly created and within each block half will be randomly assigned to GET Living and the other half to TPM. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_841866]. The 

 
 12 biostatistician will also create a randomization scheme to determine the number of days for the pre-treatment baseline period for each individual participant (2 weeks on average).  Study Procedures. At the BAS visit participants will complete informed assent/consent, complete baseline questionnaires, begin daily diaries, and begin wearing an Actigraph. Child participants will undergo biomechanical assessment (Michael Orendurff, Director of the Motion and Sports Performance Laboratory at SCH) during this visit. Notification of treatment arm allocation will occur at the end of the pre-treatment baseline period, and treatment will begin according to randomized group allocation: GET Living or TPM. Discharge testing occurs at the end of GET Living or TPM and includes participant questionnaires, child biomechanical assessment, and an exit interview. Daily diary and actigraphy ends at discharge. At 3 and 6 months follow-up, participants complete daily diaries for 7-days and self-report questionnaires.   Treatment Conditions. Participants will be randomized into: GET Living or Typi[INVESTIGATOR_841860] (TPM). During the study, participants will be instructed to not seek new treatments for pain. GET Living. An outpatient team consisting of a pain psychologist and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PT) provide GET Living, both trained in this modality of treatment by [CONTACT_841899], PhD with ongoing consultation from Johan Vlaeyen, PhD (lead innovator of GET in adults) and exposed to treatment session videos from participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. GET Living is focused and individually tailored. The primary aim of GET Living is returning to valued activities of daily life and restoring daily functioning, including return to school. The treatment manual, entitled GET Living: Graded Exposure Treatment for children and adolescents with chronic pain was adapted from the adult treatment manual49 (see Section 5.1 detailed description). The protocol consists of 12 50-minute sessions delivered twice a week for up to 12 weeks. Sessions 1-5 (education, formulation, goals) are conducted with the psychologist, PT, adolescent, and parent. Graded exposure begins in session 6. The psychologist and PT co-lead a portion of the exposure sessions. During the remaining exposure sessions, the PT leads the exposures while the pain psychologist meets individually with the parent. The final two sessions focus on relapse prevention and future goal setting. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_841860]. After randomization, participants allocated to the TPM group will initiate treatment, as indicated by [CONTACT_841900]. To ensure dose equivalency, we increased this to 6-Psychology/6-PT with 3 parent-only sessions. In pain management psychology50 child and parent sessions focus on biopsychosocial model education, goal setting, pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25125], and cognitive restructuring. PT sessions are based on Guide to Physical Therapy Practice 3.051consisting of 1) therapeutic exercise, 2) balance and proprioception, 3) strength training, and 4) use of modalities (e.g., heat/cold pack). 4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  4.[ADDRESS_1169786] meet all the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study:  • 8-18 years old; Male or Female • Musculoskeletal or neuropathic pain  (e.g., localized [back, limb], diffuse)45 not due to acute trauma (e.g., active sprain or fracture).   • Moderate to High pain-related fear (≥ 35 on the Fear of Pain Questionnaire, FOPQ), or clinician-indicated referral if scores below 35.   • Moderate to High functional disability (≥ 13 on Functional Disability Inventory, FDI), or clinician-indicated referral if scores below 13.   • Be English Language Proficient  
 
 13 4.2 Exclusion Criteria Child participants meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from study participation:  • Significant cognitive impairment (e.g., brain injury) • Significant medical or psychiatric problems that would interfere with study (e.g. seizures, psychosis, suicidality)  4.[ADDRESS_1169787] a secondary screening assessment to determine if the patient’s scores on the FOPQ and FDI meet cut-offs for the clinical trial. If eligible, patients and parent will be asked to come into the clinic for an initial baseline study visit (BAS) where consent and assent will be obtained. During this visit, following consent, participants will complete baseline assessments, including a baseline biomechanical assessment and self-report questionnaires. Child participants will also be set up with an Actigraph (activity monitoring device), and all participants (child & parent) will be introduced to the Daily Diaries. Following BAS, participants will undergo a pre-treatment data collection period (2 weeks on average). During this time, participants will be asked to complete Daily Diaries and child participants will wear the Actigraph. Following the pre-treatment baseline period, participants will be randomized into one of two treatment conditions: GET Living or Typi[INVESTIGATOR_841860] (TPM).   5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  GET Living: Participants randomized into the GET Living intervention group, will participate in 12 sessions, 1-hour each, delivered twice a week over for up to 6 weeks.    Phase I-III. The goals of Phase I-III are to educate the participants about the fear avoidance model of pain (individual and interpersonal), present the treatment rationale and formulation, create values-based treatment goals to enhance motivation, and create a pain-related fear hierarchy from the PHODA-YE results to design specific exposures. The pain psychology therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PSY) and PT are both present for these sessions to ensure that the treatment message is consistent from both providers to the family. Most of these activities are conducted jointly with the adolescent and parent present, although this varies with the developmental level of the adolescent. For example, while younger adolescents require parental input when developi[INVESTIGATOR_841867], most older adolescents do not want or need parent involvement to complete this task. In addition, depending on parent awareness of their own distress and behavior that may be impacting their adolescent’s functioning, the interpersonal fear avoidance model formulation may initially be presented separately. The decision on whom to include for the different treatment exercises in these initial sessions will be jointly negotiated by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_11437], patient, and parents.   Phase IV. Graded Exposure consists of engaging in activities perceived as potentially ‘harmful’ or ‘worrisome’ in a controlled and continuous manner in order to elicit anxiety and to foster habituation and the subsequent 
 
 14 reduction of the fearful response (extinction). Exposures can be either in-vivo or imaginal, depending on the ability to execute the activity in session. Exposures are presented in a graded fashion according to a fear hierarchy. Milder feared activities are presented first to allow patients to more easily practice the treatment techniques and to maximize the chance of successful habituation and initial treatment success. Each activity or movement is first modeled by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541], conveying to the patient that it is a safe thing to do. After completing exposure activities and having anxiety diminish within the safety of the clinician-supervised treatment session, patients are asked to complete exposure activities outside of session until distress diminishes across settings. Parent presence during exposures is at the discretion of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841868]. An adolescent may not want a parent present for any exposure sessions.   Behavioral Experiments, or methods used to empi[INVESTIGATOR_841869] a belief, are conducted during exposure sessions. In essence when an adolescent performs an activity that challenges the validity of their catastrophic assumption or belief, they are empi[INVESTIGATOR_841870]. Progress can be monitored by [CONTACT_841901], “How would you rate the probability (0-100%) that you will be unable to move after doing this activity?” When the rating has decreased substantially, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_841871]. You can also ask the patient to predict their performance level, “How far do you think you will be able to go? One foot? 10 feet? 50 feet?” Often patients will under estimate their ability and this can serve as salient feedback on their performance.    WILD Scale: Clinical experience from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_841872] a numeric rating of distress/worry about anticipated pain. This renders the SUDs rating scale (Subjective Units of Distress) typi[INVESTIGATOR_841873]-based interventions somewhat difficult to use in a meaningful way (as a measurement of distress) in this population. Therefore, in order to assess distress as required (as well as extend our assessment of each particular activity on the ladder), we generated a rating scale to assess four relevant aspects of each task. These are:  • Willingness: patient’s willingness to complete the task • Importance: important of the activity to the patient • Likelihood of Success: patient’s assessment of their likelihood of successfully completing the activity • Difficulty: patient’s assessment of the activity’s level of difficulty  Exposure Action Plan (EAP): Once again, clinical experience from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_841874], if any, exposure to pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], or active pain management strategies. The Exposure Action Plan is intended to provide the patient with a basic foundation in active pain management strategies, so that should pain increase (as is very possible) during an activity, the patient is able to persist with that activity. This plan is not intended as an all-encompassing pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_841875]; rather, it is intended to offer the patient a number of basic pain management strategies so that they may feel more empowered and in control while completing challenging tasks. Such strategies included in the EAP are breathing, stretches, movement breaks, helpful thoughts, “getting into it,” and facilitators. (Note: Facilitators should not be confused with distractions. The patient needs to attend to the activity at least in part to observe that the feared outcome either did not happen or was manageable. Facilitators are activities that can coincide with the exposure activity to facilitate its completion – e.g., listening to music while working out).   Home-based exposures (HBEs): are “homework” activities implemented at home or in the community, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_841876], continuation, or extension of exposure activities already completed in session. However, on occasion, HBEs can also be used to address activities that cannot be completed in session (e.g., riding public transportation, prolonged activities) and to address values-based goals as appropriate.    HBE Worksheets describing the specific instructions for the exposure activities, the pre-activity WILD scale, and the EAP are completed in session and sent home with patient to be brought back in the following session.

A total of 37 patients (Mean age=13.7; 77% female) consented for treatment. Of the 34 patients who began treatment (3 dropped out during baseline), 26 completed treatment (18% attrition rate). One patient was lost to follow-up (96% follow-up retention rate). To account for the observed attrition rate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim to recruit 74 patients for this exploratory clinical trial.  Patients will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_978], Laura Simons, as well as the treatment and research team. Patients are compensated for their time and contribution to this study, with increased compensation for the 3 and 6-month follow-ups. Follow-up will occur at 3 and 6-months for both treatment groups. They will be asked to complete 7-days of daily diaries and self-report assessments.

 21 6.2 Description of Evaluations  The Schedule of Evaluations will include Recruitment (i.e., screening, demographics, preliminary medical chart review), a Baseline Visit (i.e., informed consent/assent, enrollment in study, baseline assessment (i.e., completion of self-report questionnaires, biomechanical motion analysis, report of adverse events), Pre-treatment Baseline Period (i.e. Daily Diaries, Actigraphy), Treatment randomization allocation, Treatment Sessions (i.e., Daily Diaries, Actigraphy, reports of any adverse events during treatment), Discharge Assessment (i.e., self-report questionnaires, biomechanical motion analysis, exit interviews, reports of any adverse events), and 3 and 6-month follow-up (i.e., medical chart review, self-report questionnaires, Daily Diaries, and reports of any adverse events post-treatment).   6.2.1 Screening Evaluation Screening Clinicians will complete the “Clinician Referral: Eligibility Checklist” (Supplemental Materials I – CRF Templates) to indicate if a patient may be eligible for the GET Living study. Once potential participants are identified for participation at SCH, a brief screening phone call will be made by a study staff member to confirm general eligibility requirements (see Supplemental Material II for Phone Screening Form). At this point, the research team will conduct a secondary screening assessment to determine if the patient’s scores on the FOPQ and FDI meet cut-offs for the clinical trial.   Screen Failures Participants will be considered a screen failure if they do not meet all of the inclusion criteria listed in section 4.1 or if they meet any of the exclusion criteria listed in section 4.2.  Consenting Procedure Before obtaining formal written assent/consent from patients and their parents, clinical providers at the PPMC and Kaiser will obtain verbal consent to be approached by [CONTACT_8362]. Study staff, which will include a research coordinator (RC) or postdoctoral fellow trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Laura Simons, will conduct the consent and assent procedure. Eligible participants will be educated about study procedures or any changes in those procedures. Signed consent/assent forms will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in [CONTACT_841915]’ office.  6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and Randomization Enrollment Study consenting/assenting and enrollment will take place at the initial study visit. All procedures will be completed by a research coordinator (RC) and/or postdoctoral fellows.    Consenting Procedure for Enrollment This study will follow the Informed Consent Process for Research according to the Stanford University Research Compliance Office. Each participant’s consenting process will be recorded by [CONTACT_841903] “Screening and Enrollment Log” (MOOP Supplemental Materials I) within an online REDCap CRF. The signed consent/assent documents will be stored in a locked cabinet in the PI, [CONTACT_841916]’, office.   The informed consent process will take place in a private office, and participants will have the opportunity to choose their seating, read the consent form, and ask any questions they may have 
 
 22 at the beginning of the data collection session. Signed consent/assent forms will be stored in a locked file. Participants will be reminded that their involvement in this study is completely voluntary, and that they can withdraw it any time without any negative repercussions whatsoever (e.g., with regard to clinical care or healthcare access). They will also be explicitly told that they may leave any question blank for questionnaires or unanswered for the clinical interview if they do not feel comfortable answering.  See Supplement Material for the consent and assent form.  Non-English Speaking Participants – Individuals who do not speak or understand English will not be recruited to the study. While we recognize the limitations of this approach, practical considerations necessitate the inclusion of only those who are able to speak or understand English.   Enrollment date will be recorded in the “Screening and Enrollment Log” ECRF, which will also include documentation of inclusion/exclusion criteria.   Baseline Assessment (BAS): During the initial study visit, a baseline biomechanical assessment will be conducted and self-reports questionnaires will be completed by [CONTACT_86547].  • Child & Parent Baseline Self-Report Measures:  See Supplemental Materials III for baseline self-report measures • Patient Biomechanical Assessment – Motion analysis will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michael Orendurff, PhD, of the Motion and sports Performance Laboratory of Stanford Children’s Health. Gait (stride length and velocity) 37, drop jump landing37, and dynamic postural control41 tasks will be performed by [CONTACT_102]. Pre-Treatment Baseline Period During the Pre-Treatment Baseline period, patients will complete the following:  • Child and parent will complete daily diaries collected via REDCap to monitor daily fear of pain, avoidance, acceptance, catastrophizing and pain ratings.  • Actigraphy data will be collected to track daily physical activity and sleep.  The pre-treatment baseline period will last an average of 2-weeks.  See Supplemental Materials III for child and parent daily diaries  Randomization After a 2-week (on average) pre-treatment daily diary, adolescents will be randomized to either GET Living or TPM and stratified on fear (moderate/high) and disability (moderate/high). A block randomization strategy (Table 5) will be used with randomly generated blocks of [ADDRESS_1169797]. Derek Boothroyd.

AEs are categorized according to the following scale:   Severity Ratings Adverse Events (AEs) will be rated on the following three-point scale, to the determine the severity of  • Mild: An experience that is transient and requires no special treatment or intervention. The experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activities. • Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments. This experience impacts usual daily activities. Includes laboratory tests alterations indicating injury, but without long-term risk.  • Severe: An experience that requires therapeutic intervention unrelated to clinical trial treatment intervention. The experience interrupts usual daily activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841882], this will be classified as an SAE.   Relatedness Ratings Adverse Events (AEs) will be rated on the following three-point scale, to the degree to which the event appears to be related to the study intervention: • 0, Unrelated • 1, Possibly Related • 2, Definitely Related  Expectedness Ratings Adverse Events (AEs) will be assessed as to wither they were expected to occur or unexpected, meaning not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol or based on the treating clinician’s experience:  • Unexpected: the nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, or clinician’s experience • Expected: the event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.    Unanticipated Problem (UP): an unanticipated problem involving risk to human participants or others, is one that (1) was unforeseen at the time of its occurrence, (2) is related or possibly related to participation in the research, and (3) indicates that participants or others are at an increased risk of harm.  
 
 25   Serious Adverse Events (SAE): Any AE that result in any of the following outcomes:  • Death • Suicide/Homicide Attempt • Life-Threating event  • Event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Persistent or significant escalation of disability/incapacity   There is no evidence that participation in this treatment trial will increase risk of a serious adverse event (SAE). 7.[ADDRESS_1169800] occurred since the end of treatment. The known potential risks will be described in informed consent documents and protocol.  All AEs and SAEs will be monitored on a continual basis and documented, by [CONTACT_3445], in the respective eCRFS (MOOP Appendices B-C) on REDCap. All AEs and SAEs will also be collated across participants into a Master Sheet for presentation to the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) at quarterly meetings.  In addition, all SAEs and UPs are reported according to the Stanford Medical IRB reporting guidelines (within 10 working days of occurrence). Follow-up remediation will occur within five days of the IRB’s response or decision. All AEs will be reviewed quarterly by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187211].  SAEs and specific treatment intervention-associated AEs will be reported to the PI, [CONTACT_841916], and responsible study staff within 24 hours. All SAEs and UPs will be reported to the NIAMS within 48 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. There are no SAEs anticipated for this research study.  7.5 Follow-up for Adverse Events All AE’s will be reported to the IRB of record within five days. Follow-up remediation will occur within five days of the IRB’s response or decision. 7.6 Safety Monitoring  Oversight of this clinical trial is provided by [CONTACT_079] (PI), [CONTACT_841915]. The Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) will involve the following individuals:  • Lonnie Zeltzer, MD (Medical Expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700]) – Mattel Children’s at UCLA • Soumitri Sil, PhD (Clinical Psychology Expertise) – Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta • Tarcisio De Campos, PT (Physical Therapy Expertise) – Macquarie University As this is a single-site clinical trial involving low risk, the individuals listed above, along with the PI, [CONTACT_841915], and the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be responsible for the duties involved with this DSMP.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  9.1 General Design Issues    Aim 1a: To evaluate pain-related fear outcomes between GET Living and TPM. Hypotheses: Compared to TPM, the GET Living group will (1) have significantly less pain-related fear avoidance (adolescent, parent) at discharge, with continued gains at 3 and 6-month follow-up; Exploratory: (2) have fewer number of days to achieve pain-related fear improvement, assessed via daily diaries.  Aim 1b: To evaluate disability and parent responses to pain outcomes between GET Living and TPM. Hypotheses: Compared to TPM, adolescents receiving GET Living will have (1) significantly less functional disability and protective parent responses at discharge, with continued gains at 3 and 6-month follow-up; Exploratory: (2) fewer number of days to achieve decreased functional disability and protective parent responses, assessed via daily diaries; (3) significantly better adolescent joint kinetics at discharge, assessed via motion analysis; and (4) demonstrate significantly greater increases in daily physical activity levels at discharge via actigraphy. We will also examine treatment response correlates: age, pain, gender, diagnosis, and readiness to change.  Aim [ADDRESS_1169802] scores. Exploratory endpoints. Daily Diary (DD): We will use a randomization test (https://tamalkd.shinyapps.io/scda/)53 to assess the difference between baseline (BAS) to discharge (END) and BAS to 3 and 6-month follow-up (FU)21,54. We will also examine at what point during treatment significant improvements occur using delayed effect lags (one effect equals 1 day) until p-value 0.05 is reached. Actigraphy: Actilife software will be used to extract data and calculate mean and peak daily activity. Published data reduction methods will be used43. We will model physical activity (mean, peak) at two time points using mixed 2 (time) x 2 (group) ANOVAs. Rate of change in physical activity from BAS to END will also be examined using DD method. Biomechanical assessment: Full body joint kinematic (motion) and kinetic (force) data will be collected with a 20-camera Vicon system (Centennial, CO, [LOCATION_003]) with 5 integrated force plates (Bertec; AMTI).  Markers will be placed on each participant according to the 3D Plug In Gait model (Vicon) with data recorded and processed in Nexus 2.6.1. Participants will walk, complete the Star excursion balance test and drop jump task37,41. Biomechanical variables (stride length; peak hip and knee extensor moments; peak ankle plantarflexor moment; Star excursion balance score) will be extracted using Event Analyser (Vicon) for error free data reduction.  We will model biomechanical variables using mixed 2 (time) x 2 (group) ANOVAs. We will also examine treatment response correlates: age, pain, gender, diagnosis, and readiness to change. 
 
 27  Aim 2: To characterize feasibility of GET Living to inform implementation of a large multi-site RCT. Hypotheses: GET Living participants will have (1) high treatment satisfaction ratings (mean score ³ 40 of 60; reflective of satisfied or very satisfied); Secondary: (2) ³ 80% sessions completed on-schedule, ≤ 20% attrition rate, ³ 80% adolescent and parent daily diary adherence; Exploratory: (3) fewer health care costs at 3 and 6-month follow-up compared to TPM.  Aim 2 Analysis Plan. Satisfaction. We will examine mean satisfaction scores. Adherence/Retention. We will examine mean parent and adolescent adherence to daily diary completion, percent of patients who dropout prior to treatment completion, and percent of sessions completed on-schedule. Health care costs. We will examine mean costs across arms at [ADDRESS_1169803] us a starting total sample size of 74 (37 in each arm). Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we expect roughly 19% attrition during treatment to a total of [ADDRESS_1169804] and error variances. The mixed models simulation allowed us to use more data and yielded slightly higher power estimates. Primary Outcome: In our primary power calculation, we assumed that the improvement in adolescent pain-related fear at [ADDRESS_1169805] power of 87% with 58 (29 in each arm) at end of study. Under more conservative assumptions, we still have power of 80% with only [ADDRESS_1169806] power of 80% with 50 at end of study and a treatment difference of 15.4. Other Outcomes: For parent pain-related fear, our estimated treatment difference at [ADDRESS_1169807] deviation for change of 8.5. This would give us power close to 100% for [ADDRESS_1169808] 90% power with a treatment difference of only [ADDRESS_1169809] of 65% assuming [ADDRESS_1169810] deviations of 11.2 for change and 12.6 at each time point and estimated power by [CONTACT_841904] 3 and 6-months was significant at level 0.05. This provided a slightly higher power estimate of 67% and an estimated power of 79% if the treatment difference is 8 (1 point larger than expected).  Treatment Assignment Procedures  After a 2-week pre-treatment baseline period, patients will be randomized to either GET Living or TPM and stratified on fear and disability scores (see Table 6 for scoring criteria). A block 
 
 [ADDRESS_1169811]. Derek Boothroyd (please see Table 5 in section 6.2.2 for fear and disability stratification).  Patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_137980]-blinded research coordinator or postdoctoral fellow. Those who are randomized to the TPM group can opt to participate in GET Living after their study assessments are complete (6.5 months after baseline). They will no longer be considered a participant of this study at that time.  9.3  Definition of Populations We do not plan to differentiate ITT and per protocol populations for the analyses.  9.4 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_841884] 50% of our planned sample of treatment completers, we will conduct an interim analysis. The intent of this interim analysis is to implement stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_841885].   In order to maintain power at full planned enrollment (in the case that the interim analysis does not stop the study) without adding subjects while also accounting for the additional look at the data, we will use O’Brien-Fleming significance levels (0.0054 for the interim analysis and 0.0492 for the final analysis). For futility, we propose a conditional power approach where we will stop for futility if the conditional power is below 10%. Adding a futility rule for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_841886] a type I error. 9.5 Outcomes  Please refer to Section 9.1. Analysis and outcomes will be reviewed by [CONTACT_976], Co-Is, and consultants as needed.  9.5.1 Primary Outcome   The primary outcome is pain-related fear (adolescent and parent). This will be measured through the Fear of Pain Questionnaire (FOPQ-C, FOPQ-P) measure collected at Baseline, treatment study Discharge, and [ADDRESS_1169812]-discharge follow-up time points. The Photographs of Daily Activities (PHODA-YE) will also be used to measure pain-related fear outcomes at Baseline and treatment study Discharge.  9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes   The secondary outcome is disability. This will be measured with the Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) measure at Baseline, treatment study Discharge, and [ADDRESS_1169813]-discharge follow-up time points with the following measures: Adult responses to Child’s Symptoms (ARCS), Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_821969] (HHI), Parent Psychological Flexibility Questionnaire (PPFQ), Chronic Pain Questionnaire (PPAQ), and Pediatric Quality of Life – School Functioning Subscale (PedsQL).  
 
 29 9.5.4 Exploratory Outcomes Physical Activity (Actigraphy), Daily Diary (Child and Parent), and Biomechanics (motion analysis) are exploratory outcomes. Actigraphy will be measured during 2-week pre-treatment baseline throughout active treatment. The Daily Diary will be administered for an average of 14 days during the initial baseline period through treatment, and again for 7 days at the 3 and 6-month follow-up time points. Motion analysis will be conducted at Baseline and Discharge sessions.   9.5.5 Feasibility Measures Feasibility will be measured in terms of treatment satisfaction, acceptability, adherence, fidelity, and healthcare use/cost. Treatment satisfaction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_841905] (PSST)60 scores completed by [CONTACT_841906]. Treatment Acceptability will be measured by [CONTACT_841907] (TEC-C, TEC-P)61, along with exit interviews collected at the discharge session. Adherence and Retention will be examined through mean parent and patient adherence to daily diary completion, percent of patient who drop out prior to treatment completion, and percent of sessions completed on schedule. A trained research assistant will listen to audio/video recordings of treatment sessions and complete treatment fidelity checklists for content and process, for both parents and child sessions (See Supplemental Materials I for checklists). Healthcare use/cost will be measured at the Baseline and [ADDRESS_1169814] Diary62.  Table 6.

With a starting sample of 74 (37/37), we expect 58 at follow-up (18% discharge attrition, 5% at 3 and 6-month follow-up). Using GET Living pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (see Table 2), we used a mixed model simulation using the standard deviations at each time point and standard deviations of change to calculate correlation and hence the random effect and error variances. In our primary power calculation, we assumed that the improvement in adolescent pain-related fear at [ADDRESS_1169816] 87% power with 58 (29 in each arm) at study end. Under more conservative assumptions, we still have power of 80% with only [ADDRESS_1169817] power of 80% with 50 at end of study and a treatment difference of 15.4. 10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 10.1 Data Collection Forms  REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), the free, secure, HIPAA compliant web-based application, will be used to collect, store, and manage data. Vanderbilt University, with collaboration from a consortium of academic and non-profit institutional partners, has developed this software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical study data. Data will be maintained in private, non-shared, protected folders stored on central computers at Stanford University School of Medicine.  The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_841887]. Only approved research staff will have access to these files.  Identifying information will not be entered or stored on the computer with the behavioral data; thus, all relevant data other than separated consent forms will be de-identified. Documentations of clinical treatment sessions from the Screening and Treatment Delivery team will be collected weekly and stored in a study file for the participant by [CONTACT_9137].  10.[ADDRESS_1169818]. Simons (PI) and research team as needed. The database will be stored on a password protected, secured and encrypted server maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Simons and Stanford University IT.   The Photographs of Daily Activity (PHODA) is a data collection platform that will be maintained by [CONTACT_841909]. Biomechanical data and analysis will be collected and maintained by [CONTACT_841910] (MSPL) at SCH and verified by [CONTACT_841911] a weekly basis.   Actigraphy data will be collected using ActiLife software and maintained by [CONTACT_9137].   Scheduling and enrollment data will be stored in an excel spreadsheet within a PHI-safe folder on Stanford Medicine Box – a secure, HIPAA compliant cloud-based data storage platform.  Treatment session audio/video recordings will be collected digitally and saved on the secure, private drive on the server and only personnel associated with the study will have access to the files. After completion of the study, all audio and video recordings will be destroyed. 10.[ADDRESS_1169819] University. The University uses the “CITI” training program (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative; https://www.citiprogram.org/). All staff must pass required tests on each module. A refresher course must be passed every 24 months.  Per NIH requirements, all staff will be trained in Good Clinical Practice (GCP), consistent with 
 
 32 principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 (R2). The research coordinator will be responsible for maintaining documentation of all CITI and GCP training certifications.  An outpatient team consisting of a pain psychology therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PSY) and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PT) provide GET Living treatment, both trained in this modality of treatment by [CONTACT_841899], PhD with ongoing consultation from Johan Vlaeyen, PhD (lead innovator of GET in adults) and Rikard Wicksell (lead innovator in CBT and ACT in adolescent chronic pain). Training for GET Living will involve outpatient team being exposed to treatment session videos from pi[INVESTIGATOR_63839] (n=16).  10.3.[ADDRESS_1169820] demonstrated psychometric soundness, including reliability and validity. 10.3.4 Protocol Deviations Each protocol deviation (PD) will be captured and documented, by [CONTACT_3445], in the Protocol Deviation Tracking Log eCRF (MOOP Appendix E). All PDs will be collated and reviewed by [CONTACT_841912]. A major protocol deviation or violation includes any procedure that differs from the IRB-approved protocol that was intended to eliminate an immediate hazard to the participant, was harmful, or is possible serious or continue non-compliance by a study staff member.   Major protocol deviations will be communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318]. All events will be communicated to the NIAMS (through KAI) within 48 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_223305].  Protocol deviations/violations that occur but do not affect participant safety will be submitted as part of the quarterly reports distributed to the SMC and subsequently shared with the NIAMS. 10.3.5 Monitoring The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_841913]. Oversight of this clinical trial is provided by [CONTACT_079] (PI), [CONTACT_841915] and a Study Monitoring Committee (see section 7.6).  11.

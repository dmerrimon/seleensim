2. Objectives  
The objectives of this clinical study are to evaluate:  
• The effectiveness of treatment of cavitated caries in children by [CONTACT_682687] f luoride (SDF) in  comparison to conventional restorati ve treatments  
• The perceptions of parents and patients to both treatment modalities and their levels of acceptability  
• The opi[INVESTIGATOR_682677] 
• The relative cost -effectiveness of the two treatment approaches regarding both practitioner 
chair time and material- based cost  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_924723] 
report s of the use of silver compounds in dentistry to reduce the incidence of caries in the primary 
dentition date back to the 1840s.6   In the late 60’s and early 70’s research by [CONTACT_682688].7,8,9,[ADDRESS_924724] arisen 
regarding Arresting Caries Treatment (ACT) as opposed to traditional restorative dental 
treatments, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_682678] a restoration.[ADDRESS_924725] – 1. It offers control of pain and infection. 2. Its ease of use is great. 3. It is highly 
affordable. 4. There is minimal time involvement for its application. 5. It is a non- invasive option.[ADDRESS_924726] few decades regarding the effectiveness of SDF has been relatively consistent.  In comparison to 5 percent sodium fluoride (NaF; used commonly in professionally applied fluoride varnishes), [ADDRESS_924727] shown this black discoloration 
appears to be a non -issue, as the coloration of the teeth follow ing treatment did not decrease patient 
satisfaction.21  However, additional research has still been aimed at reducing the black 
discoloration of the tooth by [CONTACT_682689] (KI) following SDF application or by [CONTACT_682690], such as ammonium hexofluorosilicate ((NH
4)2SiF 6).[ADDRESS_924728] used intraorally is its compatibility with intraoral 
soft-tissues.  Recent research has confirmed that tissue ulcerations and argyria were not present 
following treatment with SDF.
19 Only transient mild erythema of the gingiva near the SDF -treated 
tooth and a metallic taste in the patients’ mouths were noted in some p atients, supporting that the 
use of silver diamine fluoride is quite safe. 19, [ADDRESS_924729] shown that 
applications of 10% stannous fluoride or tannic acid were not shown to have an additional benefit in arresting caries although they may have appeared to accelerate the process of SDF uptake by 
[CONTACT_682691].

3.6. Current Research  
According to Rosenblatt at el., the advantages of SDF are numerous.  While it can control the 
infection, it is also easy to use, highly affordable, involves minimal chair time, and is quite non-
invasive.12  They also concluded there is no [published] research that addresses all of these topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. 
SDF was approved in the [LOCATION_002] in July [ADDRESS_924730] caries in children.
 13  Also, there seem 
to be no studies that address the failure rates of SDF in comparison to conventional one and two-surface restorations for the treatment of dentin caries.  The researchers’ aims in this study will be 
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 7 to address  affordability, ease of use, and both patient/parent and provider acceptance, in addition 
to clinical success rates when compared to conventional restorations. 
 
4. Materials and Methods  
4.1. Purpose  
To determine the effectiveness of the application of s ilver diamine fluoride (SDF) in comparison 
to conventional restorative treatments in International Caries Detection and Assessment System 
criteria ( ICDAS ) 5 and 6, one and two surface carious lesions in primary molars which will be 
assessed based on major and minor failure criteria when followed for one year. Additionally , 
parents ’/children ’s and providers ’ perceptions will be assessed  as well as the cost of both regimens, 
to include both chair time spent and materials’ costs . 
 
4.2. General Outline  
Children, 2-10 years  of age  will be invited to participate. The original study site is Mott Children’s 
Health Center (MCHC) in Genesee County, Michigan. Following a slow recruitment period, the 
University of Michigan School of Dentistry (UMSOD) Children’s Clinic was added as a second 
study site .  Given the current data in the literature, the combined failure rate for conventional 
restorative techniques (e.g . compomers ) is approximately 29% at  one year follow -up,30 while 
application of silver diamine fluoride  has a failure rate of 63% at one year follow -up, with 
increased success over time.28  Although the failure rate of SDF at one -year follow -up seems 
alarming, as indicated by [CONTACT_682692], et al . it may be possible to increase the success rate with additional 
applications providing success rates up to 90.1% at 24 months. 28  Using these data, α- value of 0.05 
and a Power set at 80%, the resulting sample size would be 68 (34 per group)  as calculated using 
the software, nQuery (Appendix 1). To account for 30% attrition, the final number needed for the initial study will be 98 (92 for 25% attrition, 86 for 20% attrition). Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_682693] (plus a final study visit)  to reduce 
attrition (Table 1 ). Given a review of the current literature of the few Randomized Controlled 
Clinical Trials involving SDF worldwide, the majority of this research has been completed with 
pre-school aged children. Almost all research discusses arresting or prevention of c aries in the 
Version 4.[ADDRESS_924731] permanent molars. Due to the strength of 
the current research, this study will be focused on the primary dentition of children in the U.S. 
These children and their parents will be approached when presenting for examination/recall/or 
treatment at Mott Children’s Health Center, Flint, MI , or the University of Michigan School of 
Dentistry Children’s Clinic, Ann Arbor, MI .  Interested families with children that qualify 
following screening  examination will be provided with an Informed C onsent /Assent  (Appendix 3) 
and an Enrollment Information Form (Appendix 4). 
 
4.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Eligible children will be identified during a screening at initial presentation.  They must fulfill the 
inclusion criteria which include (Appendix 10, CRF 10): 
• Patients must be ages 2-10. 
• Presence of at least one active (soft) cavitated carious lesions in the primary dentition, 
extending into dentin (ICDAS 5 or 6) – Only one tooth will be selected for the study. All 
others will be restored and monitored according to the American Academy of Pediatric 
Dentistry (AAPD) guidelines . 
• The selected tooth must have a one or two surface lesion (more than 1/[ADDRESS_924732] be remaining) and must allow for direct application of SDF. 
• Study teeth will not have any spontaneous or elicited pain due to caries, tooth mobility, or signs of pulpal infection.  
• Selected primary teeth must have an anticipated exfoliation date greater than [ADDRESS_924733] . 
 
Exclusion criteria include children with: 
• Hereditary developmental defects such as Amelogenesis Imperfecta and Dentinogenesis Imperfecta  
• Severe medical conditions that do not allow the child to be managed in the 
MCHC/UMSOD clinics  
• Known allergy /sensitivity to  dental materials being used, including SDF 
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 9 • Inability of the child to cooperate for treatment, recall examinations, or periapi[INVESTIGATOR_682679].  
• Wards of the State, for consenting reasons 
 After approaching the parent with a brief discussion of the study, determining interest and asking 
brief pre -screening eligibility questions as approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB), the 
informed consent process will occur . Parents will provide both written and verbal consent , and 
written and verbal assent will  also be asked of the children older than age 8 (Appendices 2 &3) .  
Following the informed consent process, full study eligibility criteria will be reviewed with the 
pediatric dental r esident performing the procedure.  At time of consent, the parent will also be 
provided the Enrollment Information Form  (Appendix 4)  as a reminder of important information 
and frequently asked questions.  This form will include information regarding  study purpose, 
duration (12 months, including application/restorative appointm ent, 3 fo llow-up visits, and 
additional follow -up phone calls /contacts ), possible resulting appearance , and overall study 
protocol.  
Children who are enrolled to participate in the study will receive a full mouth caries examination 
using the ICDAS criteria  (Examiners will be trained and calibrated in the ICDAS criteria prior to 
study initiation.), and will be randomly divided into two groups:  
1. Conventional management of caries group : This group will receive traditional 
restorative care for one tooth with a one or two surface lesion – including composite, 
amalgam, or glass -ionomer restorations according to the current AAPD treatment 
guidelines.  
 
2. SDF management of caries group : This group will receive application s of SDF applied 
to their carious lesion, in lieu of restoration placement, with the goal of “arresting caries”.   
 
4.4. Participant Allocation and B linding  
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 10 Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two caries management 
groups in a 1:[ADDRESS_924734] -operative appearance is 
likely to differ markedly between groups. In the event treatment for the patient is failing , regardless 
of the treatment arm assigned , the provider will recommend additional treatment and can withdraw 
the patient at an y time  and appropriate reasoning will be recorded. Patients/parents have the right 
to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason as well .  Additionally their reasoning 
for withdrawal will be recorded (Appendix 10, CRF 04, 11, 14-17).   
 
5. Interventions  
Patients will be randomly assigned to the following groups, and managed under that philosophy for a 12 month period.  Each appointment for either intervention group will follow the designated 
Workflow  for that appointment  (Appendix 5- 8) and appropriate subsequent documents will be 
completed at each visit (Appendix 9).  
5.1. Conventional management of caries 
These children will receive restorative dental care in alignment with the AAPD guidelines, within the confines of the MCHC or UMSOD clinic s.  This tr eatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_682680], placement of rubber dam, caries removal with rotary and hand instruments, and placement of a final restoration. Following completion of the 
conventional caries management, the provider will com plete the CRF 02 Intervention Visit: 
Conventional Restoration CRF (Appendix 10, CRF 02).  For b oth study interventions, fluoride 
varnish application should not be applied within one week before or after study intervention  
so that the effects noted will not be confused with known positive effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_682681]. 
 
 
 
5.2. SDF management of caries  
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 11 • The selected tooth with notable decay into dentin will be isolated with cotton rolls . 
• No caries removal will be performed, except for food or other obvious debris.21 
• Tooth will be dried with gauze and SDF solution will be placed on the carious dentin 
until it is saturated . 
• Excess SDF will be blotted dry with a cotton pellet.  
• A second application of SDF solution will then be placed to ensure tha t the entire 
carious surface is wetted, and excess will again be blotted with a cotton pellet.  
• Following the second application of SDF, the area will be isolated for [ADDRESS_924735] with saliva and soft tissues  
• Should the SDF come in contact [CONTACT_682694], soft tissue should immediately 
be wiped with a saline wipe 
• Following completion of the SDF intervention visit, the provider will complete the CRF 
03 Intervention Visit: Silver Diamine Fluoride CRF  (Appendix 10, CRF 03). 
• A second application of SDF will be applied at 6 month recall, following the same 
protocol as noted above  (Due to the potential for increased caries arrest rate with a 6 
month application
28). 
• Any new carious lesions that develop aft er the initial treatment will be recorded, and 
treated using conventional treatment methods and will not be included in the study.  
• Following the completion of this study,  teeth in the SDF group will be treated according 
to AAPD guidelines or observed for e xfoliation.  The parent of an SDF treated child 
can elect a restoration  following AAPD guidelines at the [ADDRESS_924736] procedures at the MCHC /UMSOD: 
• Oral Health Instruction (OHI) and diet instruction  
• Tooth brushing/dentifrice use at home 
• Fissure sealants for permanent teeth will be placed if deemed necessary . 
• Traditional preventative care at recalls based on AAPD guidelines ( Regular recall exams, 
prophylaxis, scaling, flossing, and fluoride  varnish at 6 month recalls  will be provided 
for both treatment arms.  Special care will be taken to not apply fluoride varnish directly 
to the carious lesion which is being treated with SDF.) 
 
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 12 6. Study Visits and Intermediate Contacts  
Recalls for both groups  will occur via phone questionnaire as well as follow -up visits.  Participants 
will be contact[CONTACT_278285] 1 month, 2 months, 4.5 months and 9 months (± 2 weeks) following restoration 
placement or application of SDF.  Subjects will need to present to the clinic for follow -up visits at 
3 months  (± 6 weeks) , 6 months  (± 6 weeks) , and for study completion at 12 months  (± 6 weeks) 
(Table 1) . Subjects will also be called to schedule and confirm these follow -up visits; these short 
calls will require no payment to the study subjects . In the case of an emergency, an  emergency 
visit will be scheduled at Mott Children’s Health Center  or the University of Michigan School of 
Dentistry . An emergency will be evaluated and treated according to the AAPD guidelines, 
followed by [CONTACT_682695] s (CRFs) and reporting to IRBs and study 
sponsors (Appendix 10, CRF 14-17) . In the event of minor or major failure in either study group, 
the subject will we withdrawn from the study and teeth will be given the appropriate treatment as 
stated in the AAPD Guidelines free of charge, these teeth will be categorized as a failure, an d a 
CRF 04 Treatment Deviation  CRF (Appendix 10, CRF 04) will be completed.

7. Study Outcomes  
7.1. Questionnaires  + Acceptability Measures31,32 
At the baseline  clinical visit:  
• Pediatric Medical History Form  
o Mott Children’s Health Center/University of Michigan School of Dentistry Children’s Clinic standard form  
• CRF 05 Baseline Parent Questionnaire (Appendix 10, CRF 05) 
• CRF 06 Child Questionnaire  (Appendix 10, CRF 06) 
 
When scheduled intermediate contact [CONTACT_682697] (or in person if presenting to 
MCHC/UMSOD for other reasons)  at 1, 2, 4.5, and [ADDRESS_924740] , documenting the answers provided by [CONTACT_7071]: 
• CRF [ADDRESS_924741] (Appendix 10, CRF 07) 
 
At recall visits (3 & 6 months, 12 month final recall, plus emergency visits) the parent and patient 
will complete: 
• CRF 08 Follow-up Parent Que stionnaire (Appendix 10, CRF 08)  
OR 
• CRF 09  6 & 12 Month Parent Questionnaire  (Appendix 10, CRF 09) 
• CRF 06 Child Questionnaire  (Appendix 10, CRF 06) 
 
7.2. Clinical V ariables  
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 14 At the baseline visit the study teeth carious lesions will be assessed based on size (mm), dentin 
color (yellow, brown, black), dentin hardness (soft - any explorer penetration of dentin when very 
light force is applied or hard – no dentin penetration when using an explorer with very light 
force21), and periapi[INVESTIGATOR_171396] (outer/middle/inner third of dentin, major/minor failure 
criteria) .  All information will be noted on the respective CRF Intervention Visit by [CONTACT_682698].  These clinical characteristics will also be recorded for the SDF groups at 
follow-up visits (a s the lesion is exposed clinically). Recall clinical visits will involve assessment 
of the lesion based on minor and major failure criteria  (Table 2) . All assessments will be noted on 
the respective CRF 3 & 6 Month (Appendix 10, CRF 10 & 11) or on the CRF 12 Month at the 
patient’s 12 month recall  (Appendix 10, CRF 12 & 13). Both groups will have periapi[INVESTIGATOR_682682] 6 and 12 month recalls (and at any other time if deemed 
clinically necessary). If a radiograph from within [ADDRESS_924742] for each intervention will be calculated and analyzed for 
comparison. 
 
Table 2. Major and Minor Failure Criteria30 
 
 SDF Application  Conventional Restoration  
Success  • Caries arrested – dentin feels 
hard to explorer  
• No clinical signs or symptoms  of 
pulpal pathology  
• Tooth exfoliated without major or 
minor failure  • Restoration appears satisfactory  
• No clinical signs or symptoms of pulpal pathology  
• Tooth exfoliated without major or minor failure  
Minor Failure • Caries progre ssion – soft dentin, 
increase in  lesion size clinically or 
radiographically  
• Reversible pulpi[INVESTIGATOR_682683]  • Secondary caries  
• Restoration fracture or wear requiring repair 
• Loss of restoration  
• Reversible pulpi[INVESTIGATOR_682684] 4.0 27Apr2016 15 Major Failure  • Pulpi[INVESTIGATOR_682685]  
• Abscess formation  
• Caries progress to the extent that 
tooth is unrestorable  • Pulpi[INVESTIGATOR_682685]  
• Abscess formation  
• Restoration loss leaving tooth unrestorable  
 
 
7.3. Providers:  
Dentists ’/pediatric residents’  preferences for the 2 treatment options and time needed to complete 
a baseline visit will be recorded for each of the 2 interventions and logged on the  respective CRF 
Intervention Visit (Appendix 10, CRF 02 & 03).  
 
Provider preference of treatment modality cannot be collected through the clinical measurements 
on the study Case Report Forms. Therefore, collecting this data from the provider in addition to 
the clinical measurements will show feasibility and likelihoo d of future use. It would also be of 
great interest to the dental community.   
 
7.4. Economic Measures  
The economic evaluation of the two treatment strategies will be based on the time and material-
based cost  which will be calculated with the assistance of a Mas ters of Public Health student. 
 Additionally, this study offers the potential opportunity for continued research in long -term recalls 
and histological analysis of the study teeth upon exfoliation.  
8. Retention Strategy for Participants 
Mott Children’s Health  Center serves children and families 200% of the poverty level and below.  
While the  children are receiving care at Mott Children's Health Center  and the University of 
Michigan School of Dentistry , their parents, however, are not. The intention of this study is to 
assess the effect of SDF, yet we are very interested to promote oral health  (which in the case of 
young children is very dependent on family health) , so we will seek a study participant fee  to 
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 16 account for transportation costs  to study visits and funds that can be used for assistance with the 
oral health care needs of any family members of the study participants, if necessary .  Parents will 
receive $50 for their child’s participation  in the intervention appointment. Following successful 
recall conta cts, the parents will be provided with a $10 reimbursement (this has been used very 
successfully by [CONTACT_682699]33). 
Parents will receive payment for each of three clinical recall visits : $60 at 3 months, $70 at 6 
months and $80 at 12 months.  Following initial intervention ($50), four recall contacts  ($10 each) 
and three recall visits ($ 210 total ) this will result in a total possible participation fee  of $300.  All 
payments will be provided in the form of a gift card, and given to the parent of a participant.  The 
parent will acknowledge receipt.  Payments are funded by [CONTACT_682700], study sponsor, and are in 
no way funded by [CONTACT_682701]’s Health Center  or the University of Michigan School of 
Dentistry . 
 
9. Withdrawal Procedures  
Subjects will have the right to withdraw at any time.  Alternative conventional treatment can  also 
be provided to the SDF group at any time, if it is believed by [CONTACT_682702]’s 
best interest. Reasoning will be recorded, as a preference for or against one treatment arm may 
provide further information as to public acceptance of a tre atment, and these subjects will be 
withdrawn, CRF 04  Treatment Deviation (Appendix 10, CRF 04)  and appropriate additional forms 
will be completed and the parent will receive a Study Completion or Disenrollment Letter  
(Appendix 11). Although no adverse events are expected CRF 15 Unanticipated Problem & CRF 
16 Adverse Event Logs will be available if necessary  (Appendix 10, CRF 15 & 16 ).  In the event 
that the protocol is ever deviated from (ie. Missed recall or appropriate study procedure not completed) a CR F 14 Protocol Deviation (Appendix 10, CRF 14) will be completed .   
 
 
 
10. Statistical Analysis  
Power of the study will be fixed at 80% (β=0.20) just as was used in calculation for necessary 
sample size, with α = 0.[ADDRESS_924743] protected computer using an encrypted file and will be maintained as confidential 
protected health information (PHI). Examiners will be trained at the start of the study and 
calibrated on the use of the ICDAS criteria, and on the clinical outcome variables using extracted teeth to determine intra and inter -examiner rel iability ( dentin color, dentin hardness, and lesion 
size in mm), which will be measured with kappa statistics. A Chi- square test will be applied to 
determine if there is a difference in distribution of variables such as age, gender, brushing habits, 
fluoride exposure, etc. Chi -square tests will also be used to determine differences in dropout rates, 
failure rates, patient satisfaction/acceptance, and overall cost. The primary outcome, the proportion of children reporting major failures during the 12 month follow up period, will be analyzed using 
a mixed model with a binomial error structure. We will also analyze minor failures in a similar 
manner. The dependent variables will be a binary indicator of major failure, with differences 
between study treatments fitted as fixed effects. Estimates of the relative risk of major failure in 
the two groups will be presented in the form of odds ratios and associated 95% confidence 
intervals. Within this framework we will be able to estimate: 
1. The mean difference between groups at the end of the follow up period; 
2. The mean difference between groups across the whole of the follow up period; and 
3. The difference in the rate of change of the outcome across the follow up period 
 
11. Potential Limitations  
An initial potential problem in the study may be to obtain the 98 patients needed per the power 
analysis calculation.  Hopefully this will not remain too much of an o bstacle, as children are 
frequently seen at Mott Children’s Health Center and University of Michigan School of Dentistry 
Children’s Clinic with carious lesions of this nature. When enrolling in this study, parents are 
either simply enrolling their children  in a study where they would be provided the care that they 
would otherwise be provided outside of the study or , if receiving the alternative SDF treatment , 
they always have the ability to opt out and receive their definitive, conventional treatment. At the 
completion of the study, children who received care in the SDF group will have their study teeth 
restored according to AAPD guidelines or monitored for exfoliation, whichever is deemed most 
appropriate by [CONTACT_682703] . 
Version 4.0 27Apr2016 18  
In order to prevent confusion and withdrawal from the study following intervention due to 
misinformation, all residents at Mott Children’s Health Center and the University of Michigan  
School of Dentistry Children’s Clinic who are providers for this study will be standardized in terms 
of the presentation of the study to the parents and patients and in the informed consent and assent 
process for the parents and children involved.  It is important that these patients and their parents understand especially how the tooth may look following treatment. Teeth treated with SDF may 
become darker, and it is important to standardize this presentation by [CONTACT_682704] d 
consequences of the treatment.  
    
In order to achieve a sample population of this size in such a short amount of time, five or six 
residents at each clinical site  will be completing the screening, treatment, and recall of these 
patients.  While having m any providers is a limitation of the study, all providers will be trained 
and calibrated in their assessmen t of the tooth color and hardness  as well is in their SDF application 
technique.    
As with any treatment provided in children, especially those as young as two, it is possible that the 
children may be uncooperative for their appointments and that recall procedures cannot be performed. If a complete recall procedure cannot be fully completed, it is possible to simply 
complete the portions of the recall  that are able to be completed safely. Children who cannot 
complete an intermediate clinical recall visit but still wish to remain in the study will be continued to be monitored until the final study visit, and the reason for failure to complete the recall  will be 
noted.   
Finally, given the socioeconomic status of these patients, it may be difficult for parents to miss 
work as well as arrange transportation to and from appointments. For this reason, it was determined 
that study participants will receive a study participant fee to help offset transportation costs and to 
hopefully additionally assist with any other oral health care needs of the patient's immediate family if necessary.

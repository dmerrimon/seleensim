This study has several arms.  The overall objective  of the study is to evaluate the 
improvements in cardiac, skeletal muscle, and whole body performance after treatment 
with dietary nitrate (NO 3-) derived from beet root juice (BRJ) .  The rationale for this study  
is that it was fairly recently discovered that NO 3- from the diet can be a source for nitric 
oxide (NO) production in the body through an ‘enterosalivary pathway.’  NO has 
pleiotropic effects in the body including relaxing smooth muscle (e.g., around arter ies 
causing vasorelaxation) and, pa radoxically, stimulating skeletal muscle contraction .  
Subjects with heart failure have reduced bioavailability of NO, so they may particularly 
benefit from increased NO production via the dietary pathway.   
Substudy #1  (V̇O2peak study) . The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of acute 
ingestion of a single dose of dietary nitrate vs. placebo on exercise performance ([ADDRESS_1058820]; V̇O2peak test; short physical performance battery ), skeletal muscle (energetics, 
blood flow and/or oxygen levels),  and cardiac muscle function (using magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy and imaging). Breath NO, plasma NO 3-  and nitrite (NO 2-) will 
also be measured before and after nitrate ingestion.   
 Subjects with HF or controls (without HF) will be studied.  The study design is a 
randomized, double -blind crossover study with at least a 7 d washout in between the 2 
study days (placebo [BRJ depleted of nitrate] and BRJ ). 
Substudy #2  (Neuromuscular study) .  The purpose of this study is to assess the 
effects of acute ingestion of a single dose of dietary nitrate on exercise performance (6 
min walk; muscle power and speed of contraction as measured using a Biodex machine; 
short physical performance battery). Breath NO, plasma NO 3-  and nitrite (NO 2-) will also 
be measured before and after nitrate ingestion. There is an optional muscle biopsy as a 
part of this substudy. The purpose of this is to evaluate the molecular changes a fter 
nitrate ingestion  v. placebo.   
 Subjects with heart failure or controls (without heart failure) will be studied.  The 
study design is a randomized, double -blind crossover study with at least a 7 d washout 
in between the 2 study days (placebo [BRJ depleted of nitrate] and BRJ).   
 
A2 Primary Hypothesis  
The primary hypothesis is that patients with heart failure  will have improvements in 
exercise performance  (primary endpoint is neuromuscular power , secondary is V̇O2peak) 
after ingestion of BRJ containing dietary nitrate as compared to after ingestion with 
placebo.   We further hypothesize that breath NO, plasma nitrate and nitrite as well as 
cardiac or skeletal muscle nitrate/nitrite and cGMP will increase after ingestion of BRJ as 
compared with after placebo.  
A3 Purpose of the Study Protocol  
The primary purpose of this study  protocol is to outline the procedures for each of the 
above -listed Substudies that comprise the overall dietary nitrate intervention study.   
 
 
   
 
 6 B Background  
 
B1 Prior Literature and Studies  
• Significance of Heart Failure (HF) : HF is a major public health problem affecting 5.[ADDRESS_1058821] a 1 in 5 chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_771315]. Total HF costs are ~$39.[ADDRESS_1058822] is great as well: 40% 
of patients die within 1 y of di agnosis.1 Moreover, the number affected by [CONTACT_771319].  In addition to being a major cause of death, 
HF is a significant cause of disability. Indeed, the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association 
classification system of HF is base d on the severity of patients’ inability to exercise and 
to perform normal activities of daily living. Patients with class II HF have mildly limited 
physical activity; those with Class III have markedly limited physical activity; and those 
with Class IV ca nnot carry out any physical activity without discomfort and have 
symptoms even at rest. Given the disabling nature of HF and its tremendous impact on 
quality of life, any improvement in exercise capacity or tolerance would be of enormous 
benefit to patient s with this disease.   
 
• Significance of Nutrition and Diet in the Management of HF : Compared to what is 
known about pharmaceutical treatments for HF, relatively little is known about how diet, 
nutrition, and the microbiota may improve HF. The main nutritional guidelines for HF 
recommend avoidance of high sodium and promoting ‘healthy’ diets. Guidelines on 
specific nutrients are mostly limited to advice to include adequate vitamin and mineral 
intake to avoid rare causes of HF (e.g., Beriberi and Kesh an’s disease). Overall, there is 
a dearth of studies related to nutrition in HF patients. Our proposed study would help fill 
this gap in our knowledge.   
 
• Significance of Dietary NO3 - for Improving Exercise Tolerance in Patients with 
HF: Pharmaceutical nitrates (in combination with hydralazine) improve quality of life and 
survival2 in HF patients. By [CONTACT_771320]3 - on exercise 
tolerance in a well -designed and controlled study, our study would not only help improve 
our knowledge of nutrition in HF, but also potentially point towards a novel, relatively 
inexpensive “nutraceutical” that could be widely applied to HF treatment. There  is 
already a burgeoning literature demonstrating the effectiveness of dietary NO3 -, from 
beet root juice (BRJ) (from a standardized BRJ drink from James White Drinks Inc.), in 
enhancing exercise tolerance in normal subjects ,3-[ADDRESS_1058823] (in addition to peak performance) would be important since most 
activities of daily living and work do not require a maximal exercise capacity  but rather 
the ability  to tolerate sustained exercise.  
 
• Significance of Dietary NO 3- as a Substrate for the Alternative NO Production 
Pathway : One of the most powerful efficiency -enhancing molecules is nitric oxide (NO). 
 
   
 
 [ADDRESS_1058824] of endothelial NO production from L -arginine, mediated 
by [CONTACT_184523], is dependent upon the presence of oxygen (O 2).[ADDRESS_1058825] for NO production (i.e., NO3 - → NO2 - → NO) dietary 
NO3- is first reduced to NO2 - by [CONTACT_771321]. After NO2 - (and 
residual NO3 -) are swallowed, stomach acid, and/or ischemic/deoxygenated condi tions 
further reduce these compounds to NO. This process is O2 independent. Details of this 
enterosalivary pathway for NO2 - and NO production are expanded upon in recent 
reviews.9,[ADDRESS_1058826] cannot. These conditions 
include local ischemic and acidic conditions, which in HF patients can result from 
increased lef t ventricular (LV) wall stress, coronary artery disease, or rigorous exertion. 
Importantly, as listed in Figure 1, tolerance does not appear to develop following 
repeate d stimulation of this alternative pathway, in contrast to treatment with 
pharmacologic nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin).9 In sum, this is a heretofore under -
appreciated NO production system that may be exploited through the use of dietary 
NO3- to improve ene rgy efficiency and, hence, function in patients with HF.   
 
• Significance of O xygen Uptake  Inefficiency in HF : Inefficiency (a poor cardiac 
work:O2 use ratio) is a hallmark of HF.[ADDRESS_1058827] work from a given amount of O 2, the normally tight coupling 
between the two is impaired. This inefficiency feeds into a vicious cycle in HF: 
decreased function leads to inefficiency, which further impairs function.11 Clearly, 
inefficiency in HF is an attractive target for the development of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If this 
important input that contributes to continuing progression of HF can be improved, more 
energy should be available for work for the heart, skeletal muscle, and p otentially other 
organs.   
 
• Significance of Dietary NO 3- as a Treatment of Inefficiency in HF : There are limited 
therapeutic options for improving efficiency in HF. A few medications exist that may 
improve efficiency by [CONTACT_771322] (e.g., trimetazidine and 
perhexiline), but they are not available in the U.S., and the l atter an unattractive side 
effects. However, studies of dietary NO3 - supplementation show that it reduces the O [ADDRESS_1058828] of exercise, i.e., after dietary NO3 - supplementation peak exercise time and output 
increase, but V̇O2 at a given power decreases.3-5,13-15  An in vitro study of mitochondria 
from healthy volunteers who were supplemented with BRJ demonstrated improved 
oxidative phosphorylation efficiency (i.e., an improved P:O ratio) and a decrease in state 
4 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].15 The improved P:O ratio correlated with a decrease in the O [ADDRESS_1058829] of 
whole -body exercise. Thus, thermodynamic efficiency and coupling of muscle 
mitochondria was improved by [CONTACT_771323]. Whether BRJ -derived NO can also 
improve the whole body inefficiency of HF is unknown. Our study will help fill this gap in 
our knowledge.   
 
 
B2 Rationale for this Study  
The rationale for this study  is that it was fairly recently discovered that NO 3- from the diet 
can be a source for nitric oxide (NO) production in the body through an ‘enterosalivary 
pathway.’  NO has pleiotropic effects in the body including relaxing smooth muscle (e.g., 
around arteries causing vasorelaxation) and, paradoxically, stim ulating skeletal muscle 
 
   
 
 [ADDRESS_1058830]. This increase 
in NO bioavailability should translate into improved skeletal and cardiac mus cle and 
blood vessel function.  These improvements in organ function should, in turn, result in 
improved exercise performance, especially in patients with heart failure.  
 
 
C Study Objectives  
 
C1 Primary Aim  
The primary aim  of this study is to determine if dietary nitrate (NO 3-), in this case from 
BRJ, is efficacious in improving exercise performance  (V̇O2peak and muscle power and 
speed)  in patients  with heart failure . 
Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome measures are the V̇O2peak and peak leg muscle power  and speed .  
These were chosen because they have been correlated with survival in patients with 
heart failure.  Furthermore, these endpoints directly impact a patient’s ability to perform 
activities of daily living.  
Note: there are other Tertiary Aims  including assessment of the mechanisms by [CONTACT_771324]. To this end, the Tertiary Aims are to 
determine the effects of BRJ on plasma nitrate and nitrite levels, breath NO . 
D Investigational Agent  
 
D1 Preclinical Data  
In 2004, Webb et al.  (Proc Natl Acad Sci [LOCATION_003] 2004;101:[ZIP_CODE] –[ZIP_CODE].)  reported 
protective  effects of nitrite in isolated perfused heart preparations subjected to IR 
injury. Under  ischaemic conditions, both rat and human myocardium generated  
NO from nitrite. Although NO was produced in a dose -dependent  manner (10 –
100 mM), t he degree of protection did not differ,  suggesting that the beneficial 
effect of nitrite treatment was reached  already at low concentrations. 
Furthermore, the authors showed  that the convers ion to NO was dependent on 
xanthine oxidoreductase  (XOR), since co -administration of allopurinol or BOF -
4272 attenuated  nitrite -dependent NO f ormation. XOR is generally thought to  
contribute to IR injuries via production of reactive oxygen species  (ROS), 
including superoxide (O −  2). However, the findings by [CONTACT_771325]. suggest that 
during hypoxic conditions, nitrite supplementation  may partly shift the activity of 
XOR from generation of damaging  
O −2 to protective NO.  
 Soon after, Duranski et al.  (J Clin Invest 2005;115:1232 –1240.)  
demonstrated potent cytoprotective  effects of low dose nitrite using in vivo mouse 
models of myocardial  infarction and liver ischaemia. The nitrite -mediated effects 
 
   
 
 9 were independent  of NOS and abolished by [CONTACT_3252] -administration of the NO 
scavenger  carboxy -PTIO (cPTIO), suggesting NO as an active mediator.  
D2 Clinical Data to Date  
Based on the results from this study, we have shown that dietary nitrate (in the 
form of BRJ) has improved: 1) muscle power, 2) speed of muscle contraction, 3) 
nitrate, nitrite, and NO levels, 4) V̇O2peak.  The improvements in muscle power 
and speed and nitrate/nitrite levels was shown in patients with HF and in 
controls. Our preliminary data also suggest that muscle blood flow  and oxygen 
levels are increased in patients with heart failure.  
D3 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Initially, we had started off with giving one bottle of BRJ with ~5 -6mmol of dietary 
nitrate.  However, we were not seeing any differences between the BRJ studies 
and the placebo studies.  After increasing the dose to ~ 11.[ADDRESS_1058831] Selection and Withdrawal

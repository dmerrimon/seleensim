Confidential and Proprietary  2. SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  A Multicenter, Randomized, Double  Blind, Placebo Controlled Exploratory Study to Assess the 
Efficacy and Safety of Acthar® Gel in Subjects With Pulmonary Sarcoidosis  
Protocol Number:  MNK14344100  Type:  Phase 4 (US)  / Phase 2 (all other countries)  
Condition/Disease :  Pulmonary Sarcoidosis  
Approximate Number of 
Subjects : [ADDRESS_840291] Participation : Up to 14 month s.  
Approximate Number of Study 
Centers : Approximately  75 sites 
globally  Approximate Duration of Study : The estimated study period is  
approximately [ADDRESS_840292] 
visit (completed open -label extension and follow up visit). Expected 
enrollment period is approximately 3 years (first subject enrolled to last 
subject enrolled).  
Objective:  The object ive of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Acthar® Gel in the treatment of 
pulmonary sarcoidosis .  
Design:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled exploratory study evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of Acthar Gel in the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis. The study will have 3 phases: Screening  
(up to 28  days); double -blind treatment (24 weeks); and an optional open -label, 24 weeks extension. A follow -
up visit will be conducted 4 weeks (± 2 days) after the last  dose of IMP is administered. Following signature [CONTACT_630048] a screening period of up to 28 days, subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly 
assigned to receive :  
• Double -blind treatment: Acthar  Gel, 1 mL (80 U) or matching placebo (1 m L) administered twice 
weekly SC for up to 24 weeks.  
• Optional open -label treatment: Acthar  Gel, 1 mL (80 U) administered twice weekly SC for up to 
24 weeks.  
Subjects will be assigned to treatment in a 1:1 ratio with up to 50 subjects per arm for a total of approximately 
100 subjects.  
Dose reduction of 50% may be implemented once during the study if a subject meets one of the following 
pre-specified safety criteria based on clinical judgment:  
• Uncontrolled hypertension (newly developed or worsening of existing  hypertension) before/or in 
conjunction with addition/adjustment of antihypertensive therapy.  
• Uncontrolled diabetic signs/symptoms (newly developed of worsening of existing diabetes) before/or 
in conjunction with addition/adjustment of antihyperglycemic th erapy.  
• Unacceptable toxicity defined as any adverse event (AE) of at least moderate intensity not adequately 
controlled by [CONTACT_629991]-related measure.  
The justification for dose reduction will be captured in the eCRF.  Subjects will remain on the 40 U or 
matching placebo 2 ×/week for the remainder of the study. Subjects , who despi[INVESTIGATOR_629964], they will be withdrawn from the study due to AE.  
Subjects will b e followed every 4 weeks (±  5 days) for 24 weeks (Visit 2 to Visit 8). During each visit 
following randomization, steroid tapering evaluation will occur based on the following algorithm.  
 
Protocol MNK14344100 Acthar®Gel (Repository Corticotropin Injection)
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_840293] results. Any additional visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
additional tests or imaging performed beyond those dictated by [CONTACT_760], at the discretion of the investigator (or other disciplines for extra-pulmonary manifestations) will also be captured in the eCRF. 
Following the completion of the double blind phase, subjects will be invited to continue participation in an 
optional Open-label Extension Phase (Visit 9 to Visit 11). Subjects who decline participation in the Open-label Extension Phase, or those ineligible, will have their End- of-Treatment visit during Visit 8. 
All subjects will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks (± 2 days) after the last dose of IMP, regardless of treatment 
group, and/or participation in the optional Open-label Extension Phase.
During the optional Open-label Extension Phase, subjects will be treated with Acthar Gel 80 U 2×/week for up 
to24 weeks. Subjects who had their dose reduced once by [CONTACT_629992] 40 U 2×/week. 
There will be 3 scheduled visits during this phase: Visit 9, 4 weeks (± 5 days) into the extension phase 
(Week 28), Visit 10 (Week 36) and Visit 11 (Week 48). During these visits corticosteroid taper will follow the 
same procedures and algorithm as in the double blind phase. Subjects and physicians will complete patient 
reported outcomes, and safety will be evaluated based on targeted physical examination per organ involved, vital signs, imaging, and laboratory test results. Any additional visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or additional tests or imaging performed beyond those dictated by [CONTACT_760], at the discretion of the investigator (or other disciplines for extra-pulmonary manifestations) will also be captured in the eCRF.
During Visit 11, End-of-Treatment procedures will be completed. 
Responder rate analysis (efficacy endpoints) will be determined by [CONTACT_629993]. Adjudication will serve to address inter-rater variability. In case of discrepancies, the 
adjudication determination will be utilized for purposes of efficacy endpoint analyses. Likewise, central HRCT and C XR readings will be used for the purpose of the imaging efficacy analyses.

Confidential and Proprietary  6. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
6.1. Sarcoidos is Overview  
Sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystem granulomatous disease , with a heterogeneous clinical 
presentation and disease course , characterized  by [CONTACT_630006]. 
Although sarcoidosis has been identified as a specific disease  entity for more than a century , 
the specific cause of sarcoidosis is unknown . Current understanding is that the pathogenesis 
likely includes exposure to one or more, possibly airborne -transmitted antigens (bacterial, 
organic, anorganic), which then trigge r an abnormal immune response in a genetically 
predisposed host ( Ahmadzai et al., 2014 ; Chopra et al., 2016 ; Iannuzzi et al., 2007 ; 
Judson,  2012 ; Korsten et al., 2016 ). The disease may affect any organ system. Pulmonary is 
the most prevalent and is present in over 90% of patients. Ocular, lymph -node, and cutaneous 
manifestati ons are next in frequency  (Al-Kofahi et al., 2016 ).  
To date, there is n o gold standard for diagnosis . Presently, the diagnosis is a clinical one as no  
reliable diagnostic test exists  ATS  criteria  described in Hunninghake  et al.,  1999 ). Several 
biomarkers have been explored, including amyloid A,  lysozyme, calcium, angiotensin 
converting enzyme, vitamin D, tumor necrosis factor -α, and various interleukins (eg , sIL-2R), 
to name a few. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_629968], there is still a lack of adequately specific and sensitive disease markers for clinical 
usage, necessitating f urther research on these fronts. Accordingly, the diagnosis is based on 
the combination of c linical , radiologic al and histological (noncaseating epi[INVESTIGATOR_629969])  parameters. In lieu of diagnostic test(s), diagnostic criteria have been developed , 
and w hile vetted by [CONTACT_106971] , these are arbitrary and inexact ( Chopra et al., 2016 ; Judson, 2014 ; 
Ahmadzai et al., 2014 ).  
Sarcoidosis does not mandate treatment because  the disease may never cause symptoms , or 
organ dysfunction may remit spontaneously , in about 2/3 of patients  (Iannuzzi et al., 2007 ), 
and therapy (particularly corticosteroids) is associated with a myriad of significant side 
effects . While t he indications for treatment and the optimal treatment approach have not been 
standardized , the general consensus is that treatment should only be administered to avoid 
danger (eg, cardiac or neurologic manifestations) or to improve quality of life. ( Judson, 2014 ; 
Baughman et al., 2012 )  
Various expert driven treatment recommendations exist for pulmonary and extra -pulmonary 
manifestations of sarcoidosis, however, the available evidence to guide treatment is limited. 
Corticosteroids are typi[INVESTIGATOR_629970]-line when treatment is required . Several off label 
alternative  agents may be used, usually as corticosteroid sparing agents, because of the 
development or concerns of significant corticosteroid toxicity . Although o ften a small amount 
of corticosteroid may be continued for adequate efficacy . Second -line disease -modifying anti -
sarcoid drugs may include a ntimetabolites  (eg, methotrexate; azathioprine; leflunomide ). 
Third-line typi[INVESTIGATOR_232826] a nti-tumor necrosis factor -α biological agents  (eg, infliximab; 
rituximab; adalimumab ). Use of these  agents should be individualized based on the patient’s 
potential for toxicity and the organ that is being treated . In the f uture , there are goals  to 
develop “personalized” or “precision” medical care where therapy will be individualized 
based on the patient’s specific clinical features or genetics ( Korsten et al., 2016 ; Judson, 2014 ; 
Judson,  2012 ; Baughman et al., 2012 ; Jamilloux et al., 2017 ).

Confidential and Proprietary  Acthar® Gel has been included as third - or fourth -line therapy in several treatment algorithm s 
(Korsten et al., 2016 ; Baughman et al , 2015 ). Three studies  describing safety and efficacy of 
Acthar Gel in pulmonary sarcoidosis were recently published  and described as follows .  
The first study was a  retrospective chart review of [ADDRESS_840319] 6 months of 
posttreatment follow -up. All patients initially received Acthar Gel 80 U i ntramuscular or SC 
administration twice a week ( 2×/week). Eighteen patients (37%) discontinued drug within [ADDRESS_840320] (4 patients), death (2 patients), or drug toxicity 
(11 patients), or noncompliance (1 patient). Of the remai ning 29 patients, 11 experienced 
objective improvement in 1 or more affected organs. All but 2 patients noted disease 
improvement or oral glucocorticoid reduction. Twenty -one patients were treated for more than 
6 months (median 274 days). Nineteen patients  were taking prednisone at time of starting 
Acthar  Gel: 17 had their prednisone dosage reduced by [CONTACT_726] 50%, and [ADDRESS_840321] 3 months ( Baughman et al., 2016 ). 
The second study was a  prospective study of [ADDRESS_840322] 5% in FVC in the previous year. 
Acthar Gel  was administered at a loading dose of 80 U SC for 10 days. Patients were 
randomized at Day 14 to receive either 40  U or 80 U Acthar Gel 2×/week for 24 weeks. The  
dose of prednisone was modified by [CONTACT_630007]’s dosage of 
Acthar  Gel. At Week 24, there was a decrease in the dose of prednisone and improvements in 
DLCO, the King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire (general health status ), and the F atigue Scale. 
There was no significant change in FVC % predicted. For the positron emission tomography 
scan, there was a significant fall in the standard uptake value of the lung lesions. Only 
3/8 patients remained on 80 U repository corticotropin  for full 24 weeks. There was no 
significant difference in the response to therapy for those treated with 40 U vs 80 U Acthar  
Gel. The authors concluded that Acthar Gel treatment was prednisone -sparing and associated 
with significant improvement in DLCO, posit ron emission tomography scan, and patient -
reported outcome measures. A dose of 40 U repository corticotropin  2×/week was as effective 
as 80 U Acthar Gel and was better tolerated ( Baughman et al., 2017 ).  
 
 
 
. 
The third study was large case series of patients with advanced symptomatic sarcoidosis 
treated with r epository corticotropin injection (RCI). This  large case series study describes 
patient characteristics, RCI utilization patterns, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and physicians’ 
assessments of treatment response.  The study included 302 patients (mean  age =  51 years; 
52% women) with a mean of 4.[ADDRESS_840323] patients 
(76%) had extrapulmonary involvement, primarily in the skin (28%), joints (25%), heart 
(22%), and eyes (22%); 34% had multiple ( ≥2) organ involvement. The me an duration of RCI 
treatment was 32.5 weeks, with 61.6% of patients continuing RCI therapy for ≥6 months. The

Confidential and Proprietary  percentage of patients who used corticosteroids decreased from 61.3% during the 3 months 
before initiation of RCI to 12.9% at 3 months after RCI therapy; the mean daily dose of 
corticosteroid decreased from 18.2 mg  to 9.9 mg. The proportion of patients given 
<10 mg/day of prednisone increased from 21% before RCI use to 47% at 3 months after RCI 
use. According to physicians’ assessments of change in patients’ health status after RCI 
therapy, overall status improved i n 95% of patients, overall symptoms in 73%, lung function 
in 38%, and inflammation in 33%. The findings suggest that RCI is a viable treatment option 
for patients with advanced symptomatic sarcoidosis and provide insights on patient 
characteristics and pra ctice patterns to help clinicians determine appropriate use  
(Chopra  et al., 2019 ). 
Several studies of various agents (eg, infliximab, ustekinumab, golimumab;  
Baughman  et al., 2006 ; Judson, 2014b ; Gibson et al., 1996 ) have highlighted important issues 
that may confound trial results, including selecting patients with active disease, identifying 
IMP effects in patients receiv ing concomitant corticosteroids, and establishing proper study 
endpoints. Establishment of an appropriate endpoint is probably the single most challenging 
issue in the design of a clinical sarcoidosis trial ( Judson, 2014 ). Th e appropriate endpoint in 
sarcoidosis is dependent upon whether  one wishes to measure the degree of granulomatous 
inflammation, the physiologic impact of that inflammation, or the effect of physiologic 
impairment on the patient’s quality of life.  This is a  particularly important distinction in 
sarcoidosis, where active granulomatous inflammation may not significantly impair 
physiology or cause significant symptoms. Ideally, a clinically useful intervention in 
sarcoidosis should demonstrate a reduction in gr anulomatous inflammation that results in 
improved physiology and quality of life . Thus, multiple endpoints are likely needed to 
demonstrate clinical benefit ( Baughman et al., 2012 ; Baughman et al , 2015 ).  
The WASOG  Diseases Task Force  suggested that clinical endpoints for pulmonary 
sarcoidosis  should be based on [ADDRESS_840324] categories: PFT, chest imaging, quality of life,  and 
steroid -sparing . A composite score that include 2 or more of these categories was proposed as 
more effective than individual scores ; however, these have not been rigorously tested 
(Baughman et al , 2015 ).  
Clinical endpoints to measure disease activity in other systems affected by [CONTACT_630008], cardiac, ocular, and neurological endpoints are also planned for much needed attention 
by [CONTACT_630009] ( Baughman et al , 2015 ).  
6.2. Acthar Gel Overview  
Acthar Gel is a naturally sourced complex mixture of ACTH  analogs and other pi[INVESTIGATOR_629971] . It is approved by [CONTACT_630010]  
(Mallinckrodt ARD LLC, 2019 ). ACTH  is a member of the family of structurally related 
peptides known as melanocortin peptides. Melanocortin peptides, which in addition to ACTH 
include α -, β-, and γ -melanocyte stimulating hormones, are derived from the natur al protein 
pro-opi[INVESTIGATOR_629972] G -protein 
coupled receptors known as melanocortin receptors (MCR) ( Mountjoy et al, 1992 ). Five 
subtypes of MCRs have been identi fied to date (MC1R to MC5R), each with different tissue 
distributions, binding affinity characteristics, and physiological roles ( Getting,  2006 ). MCRs  
play a key role in regulating inflammation and other cellular function ( Catania, 2010 ). Acthar 
engages MCRs expressed on immune cells and other tissues throughout the body and is 
Protocol MNK14344100  Acthar® Gel (Repository Corticotrop in Injection)  
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_840325] 
(Catania,  2010 ; Wright et al., 2019 ; Olsen et al., 2015 ; Healy, 2017a ; Wright et al., 2019b ). 
Production of cortisol is mediated by [CONTACT_630011]2Rs primarily expressed on the adrenal 
cortex. In i n vitro  studies in cultured cells lines expressing MCR1 -MCR5, the relative 
functional potency of MCRs was measured. It was shown that 6% of Acthar’s relative 
functional potency occurred at MC2R. The remaining 94% occurred at the other MCRs 
(Wright et al., 2019 ). These data suggest that Acthar acts directly on cells involved in the 
pathogenesis of disease in addition to its indirect action via corticosteroid stimulation . 
The effects of Acthar on human B -lymphocyte function in vitro were evaluated using highly 
purified B -cell populations cultured in the absence of glucocorticoids and stimulated by 
[CONTACT_630012] -4 and cluster of differentiation 4 0 ligand as specific B -cell activating 
signals. I mmunoglobulin G was measured in supernatants from healthy human peripheral B 
cells that had been cultured for 6 days. The p ercent age of cells that divided and 
immunoglobulin G production were assessed under b asal conditions ( unstimulated) or 
stimulate d with interleukin -4/cluster of differentiation 4 0 ligand  plus vehicle. Acthar reduced 
B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin G production independent of cortisol release 
(p<0.05 , compared to vehicle -treated grou p) (Olsen et al., 2015 ; Healy, 2017a Healy_2017 , 
Healy, 2017b ). In further experiments to explore the direct effects of Acthar on human  
macrophages and  focusing on induction of pro -inflammatory mediators following 
lipopolysaccharide stimulation , Acthar inhibited the production of the pro -inflammatory 
cytokines interleukin -6 and tumor necrosis factor (p<0.0001 , compared to vehicle -treated 
group; (Healy, 2017a Healy_2017 , Healy, 2017b ). These data further demonstrate a direct 
effect of Acthar on immune cell modulation independent of cortisol release.

While the exact mechanism of action of Acthar Gel is still unknown, further i nvesti gation is 
being conducted. This information is based on nonclinical data and pharmacodynamic data 
and the relationship to clinical benefit is unknown.

Confidential and Proprietary  6.3. Rationale  
This study will provide additional data to support the efficacy and safety of Acthar Gel  in 
pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
The Acthar Gel  dose and dosing regimen for this study, namely 80 U 2×/week, are informed 
by [CONTACT_630013] , 2 recent ly published studies ( Baughman  et al.,  2016 ; 
Baughman  et al.,  2017 ) and the package insert .  
The prescribing information for Acthar Gel  recommends the use of 40  U to 80 U administered 
intramuscularly or SC every 24 - to 72 hours in adults and children over 2 years of age ; the 
specific dose is individualized according to the medical condition  
(Mallinckrodt  ARD  LLC,  2019 ).  
6.4. Risk and Benefits  
The most common adverse reactions for Acthar Gel  are similar to those of corticosteroids and 
include fluid retention, alteration in glucose tolerance, elevation of blood pressure, behavioral 
and mood changes, increased appetite , and weight gain. Acthar Gel  may also be associated 
with increased susceptib ility to new infection and increased risk of exacerbation, 
dissemination, or reactivation of latent infections . For a complete reference of known 
potential risks please refer to the Acthar Gel  product labeling ( Mallin ckrodt  ARD  LLC,  2019 ).

7.1. Objective  
The objective of th is study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Acthar Gel in the treatment 
for pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
7.2. Assessments of Efficacy  
The following assessments will be performed during  this study:  
• STS, a newly developed composite endpoint .  
• PFT.  
• Imaging: HRCT; CXR (including Scadding Score).  
• Corticosteroid tapering.  
• Physician Global Assessment . 
• Patient -reported outcomes: King’s Sarcoidosis  Questionnaire; Fatigue Assessment 
Scale; Patient's Global Assessment .  
• Symptom  Assessments : Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale ; Leicester 
Cough Questionnaire ; steroid toxicity questionnaire.  
• Functional testing: 6MW T (including the Borg Scale) . 
• ePOST.  
• Biomarkers  (including RNA and DNA samples (screening only) , if genetic ICF is 
signed) . 
• WPAI. 
7.2.1.  Sarcoidosis Treatment Score  
This is a newly developed composite score that combines the results of PFT, chest imaging, 
quality of life, and changes in corticosteroid dosing as recommended by [CONTACT_630014]  (Baughman et al., 2015 ) and based on the results of the Acthar Gel prospective study ; 
(Baughman et al., 2017 ). Individuals may score from -6 to +6. Higher scores indicate  
improvement.

• Partial Response is defined as scores of 2/6 points or stable with corticosteroid 
reduction (ie , a total score of +1 due to ≥ 50% reduction  in corticosteroid dosage ).  
• Non Response  is defined as scores of ≤ 1/6 points without significant 
corticosteroid taper (stable or deterioration) . 
 
7.2.2.  Pulmonary Function Tests 
PFTs are routinely used in  the evaluation of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. However, there is 
no diagnostic pattern in PFTs. The most prevalent pattern of PFTs is restrictive lung disease, 
although obstruction can nevertheless also be present, either in isolation or concomitantly.  
FVC is most commonly used to measure response to therapy. Nonetheless, the volume of 
FVC does not correlate clinically with symptoms of dyspnea, and there is no definite 
consensus on how to follow changes in FVC in response to treatment. Based on 
intrapul monary fibrosis, in the absence of better data, a decline of ≥ 5% (absolute change of 
predicted) FVC is consistent with refractoriness in sarcoidosis patients ( Korsten et al., 2016 ; 
Baughman et al., 2015 ).

pulmonary disease in the absence of pulmonary arterial hyperte nsion as a cause of drop in

PFT will follow ATS/ European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_629973] ( Miller et al., 2005 ) and the revisions provided for DLCO 
(Graham  et al., 2017 ).  
PFT results will include FEV 1, FVC, FVC % predicted (NHANES III reference values), 
FEV 1/FVC ratio, PEFR or FEF max, TLC, RV, DLCO (uncorrected for Hb), D LCO % 
predicted and DLCO/VA at s creening visit, Visits 5, 8 , 10, and 11 (every 12 weeks).

Patients should be instructed to avoid s moking within at least [ADDRESS_840327] on each 
subsequent PFT.  
7.2.3.  Imaging (HRCT; CXR)  
Although granulomas are microscopic structures, sarcoidosis granulomas have a proclivity to 
coalesce into macroscopic nodular conglomerations tha t are capable of being detected with 
plain radiographic or HRCT radiographic techniques. HRCT reveals more sarcoidosis lung 
involvement than the CXR including, identifying more parenchymal and mediastinal/hilar 
disease as well as parenchymal details to rel iably differentiate  from other diffuse lung 
diseases. HRCT findings have been correlated with lung pathology and have been proposed as 
a biomarker of disease activity.  
The intriguing observations of chest radiographs in sarcoidosis published by [CONTACT_630015] i n 1961 
(Scadding, 1961 ; Attachment 11 ) are still considered the gold standard because of the limited  
use of radiation and its association with resolution or progression of the disease although these 
stages do not necessarily progress or regress from one to another. However, inter observer 
variability and lack of association with functional clinical parame ters (eg , PFT, 6MW T) are 
limiting factors ( Korsten et al., 2016 ; Chopra et al., 2016 ). 
Imaging will be evaluated by [CONTACT_093]/ radiologist and the central reader to determine 
if the cond ition is improving, stable, or deteriorating based on a 5-point  Likert score: much 
worse; worse; unchanged; better; much better.

Protocol Version [ADDRESS_840328]- line when treatment of sarcoidosis is required. Concerns 
of significant corticosteroid toxicity results in efforts to taper as early as possible. There is 
little consensus regarding the optimal algorithm for tapering corticosteroids ( Judson, 2014 ). 
Subjects will be evaluated at each vis it (following randomization) and the following algorithm 
will be used to taper the corticosteroid dosage: 
Incremental doses of prednisone for the study are 40, 30, 20, 10, 7.5, 5, 2.5, and 0 mg 
(Baughman et al., 2002 ).
7.2.5. Steroid Toxicity Questionnaire
This directed questionnaire ( Attachment 2 ) provides a Likert scale for the subject to score 
several specific potential symptoms which could be attributed to steroid toxicity
(Baughman et al., 2002 ).
7.2.6. King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire
The King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire ( Attachment 4 ) is a 28 item questionnaire for subjects 
to indicate the status of their sarcoidosis and treatment ( Patel et al., 2013 ). Higher scores 
indicate improvement. A change of 4 points is considered clinically meaningful. 
7.2.7. Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS)
The Fatigue Assessment Scale ( Attachment 5 ) is a [ADDRESS_840329] for subjects to indicate 
their level of fatigue ( De Vries et al., 2004 ). Lower scores indicate improvement (less 
fatigue). A change of 4 points is considered clinically meaningful. 
7.2.8. Patient’s Global Assessment
The Patient’s Global Assessment ( Attachment 6 ) is a numerical rating scale typi[INVESTIGATOR_629975]. Patients report on improvement/worsening of their overall disease 
compared to the condition at baseline and at every visit ( Nikiphorou et al., 2016 ).

7.2.12.   Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT)  
The 6MWT ( Attachment 1 2) is objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. It is a  
practical test that requires a [ADDRESS_840331] surface during the period of 6 minutes (treadmill 
are not recommended ). The 6MWT  evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the 
systems involved during exercise, including the pulmo nary and cardiovascular systems, 
systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle 
metabolism. It does not provide specific information on the function of each of the different 
organs and systems involved in exercise or t he mechanism of exercise limitation, as is 
possible with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing.  Changes in 6MW T after therapeutic 
interventions  correlate with subjective improvement in dyspnea .  
The 6MWT will be performed according to ATS guidelines wit h an impr ovement of 
≥ [ADDRESS_840332] ( ATS, 2002 ).  
7.2.13.  Extrapulmonary Physician Organ Severity Tool (ePOST)  
The ePOST examine s 18 extrapulmonary organs and assigns a score to each one (0  = not 
affected to 6  = very severely affected).  The state of sarcoidosis is evaluated at each visit, by 
[CONTACT_093]. Investigators use all clinical information available to them, including 
laboratory analyses, and assessments by [CONTACT_630016]. Scores are 
calculated by [CONTACT_630017] ( Judson et al., 2008 ).  
7.2.14.   Biomarkers/genomics  
As stated in Section 6.1, despi[INVESTIGATOR_629976], there is still a lack of adequately specific and sensitive disease markers for 
clinical usage, necessitating further research on these fronts. Accordingly, biomarkers levels 
will be collected as an exploratory assessment and compared between Screening , and every 
12 weeks  (up to 48 weeks  for those subjects participating in the optional Open -label

Genomic profile (optional) will be assessed based on the evolution of science at the time of 
study completion . 
7.2.15.  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment  
The WPAI is a validated assessment of work and activity impairment associated with health 
problems ( Zhang et al., 2010 ). This questionnaire is to be completed by [CONTACT_1766]. When this 
assessment is required, it should be the first assessment done at any visit (with the subject 
completed efficacy questionnaires) and must be completed prio r to any study drug dosing.  
Subjects will be provided a quiet, private place to complete the assessment. Subjects will be 
instructed to answer all questions to the best of their ability and without help from others 
(including study staff, relatives, or fr iends). Subjects may refrain from answering any 
question.  
The study staff should review the questionnaire after it is completed and encourage the 
subjects to complete any missing information. Study staff will record the refusal of subjects to 
answer any questions in the source documents.  
7.3. Efficacy Endpoint s 
The endpoint s for th e efficacy objective are: 
• STS response rate at 24 weeks  (Visit 8) .

Following signature [CONTACT_630050] a screening period of up to 2 8 days, subjects who meet all 
eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive either 1 mL ( 80 U) of Acthar Gel or 
1 mL of a matching placebo SC 2×/week. Subjects will be assigned to treatment in a 1:1 ratio 
with up to 50 subjects per arm  for a total of approximately 100 subjects . 
Dose reduction of 50% may be implemented once during the study , if a subject meets one of 
the following prespecified safety criteria  based on clinical judgment : 
• Uncontrolled hypertension (newly developed or worse ning of existing 
hypertension) before/or in conjunction with addition/adjustment of 
antihypertensive therapy.  
• Uncontrolled diabetic signs/symptoms (newly developed of worsening of existing 
diabetes)  before/or in conjunction with addition/adjustment of antihyperglyc emic 
therapy.  
• Unacceptable toxicity defined as any AE of at least moderate intensity not 
adequately controlled by [CONTACT_630019]-related

The justification for dose reduction will be captured in the eCRF. Subjec ts will remain on the 
40 U or matching placebo 2×/week for the remainder  of the study. Subjects  who, despi[INVESTIGATOR_40808] , continue to experience any of the above mentioned AEs, (meet a criteria as above) 
or experience another event  will be withdrawn fro m the study due to AE  (Section 12.3).  
Subjects will be followed every 4 week s (± 5 days) for 24 weeks  (Visit 2 to Visit 8). During 
each visit following Visit 2 , steroid tapering evaluation will occur based on the corticosteroi d 
tapering algorithm  (Section  7.2.4 ). A justification for any deviation will be captured in the 
eCRF.  
In addition, subjects and physicians will complete patient re ported outcomes, and safety will

Protocol MNK14344100  Acthar® Gel (Repository Corticotrop in Injection)  
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_840344]  
Acthar Gel is a naturally sourced complex mixture of ACTH analogs and other pi[INVESTIGATOR_629978] 16% gelatin for intramuscular or SC injection. Acthar Gel contains 0.5% phenol, 
not more than 0.1% cysteine (added), sodium hydroxide and/or  acetic acid to adjust pH, and 
water for injection. Acthar Gel is obtained from processing porcine pi[INVESTIGATOR_629979].  Sarcoidosis is an approved indication  for Acthar Gel  
(Mallinckrodt  ARD  LLC,  2019). 
Placebo is a sterile preparation of 16% gelatin for intramuscular or SC injection. Placebo 
contains 0.5% phenol, not more than 0.1% cysteine, sodium hydroxide and/or acetic acid to 
adjust pH, and water for injection. The p lacebo  formulation is identi cal to Acthar Gel except 
that it contains no active medication . 
12.1. Methods of Assigning Subject s to Treatment Groups  
12.1.1.  Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized according to computer -generated allocation scheme to receive 
either Acthar Gel  1 mL (80 U) or placebo 1 mL administered 2×/week. Both investigators and 
the subjects will be blinded to the treatment assignment. A block randomization will be 
performed. The biostatistician will decide on the details at the time of the creation of the 
randomization scheme.  
12.1.2.  Interactive Telephone/Web Response System  
The investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_630028]  (Visit 1) . The 
subject’s identification number  (ID) will be determined by [CONTACT_630029]. 
Subject identification numbers will consist of 7 digits: the first [ADDRESS_840345] ’s 
name. The investigator  must follow all applicable privacy laws in order to protect a subject ’s 
privacy and confidentiality. Information that could ident ify a subject  will be masked on 
material received by [CONTACT_456].  
Protocol MNK14344100  Acthar® Gel (Repository Corticotrop in Injection)  
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_840346] 
notify the sponsor’s MM or physician designee  before unblinding, if at all possible, or  
immediately after unblinding  the treatment assignment. The investigator and sponsor should 
make every effort to document and limit the subjects who are unblinded to the tre atment  
assignment. The investigator must also indicate in source documents that the blind was broken 
and provide the date  and reason for breaking the blind.   
12.3. Dosing Procedures  
Both Acthar Gel  and placebo are supplied as 5 mL multidose vials. Acthar Gel  vials contain 
80 U of ACTH per mL.  Vials  will be labeled according to all applicable national and local 
regulations.  
The vials should be warmed to room temperature before using. The vials should not be over 
pressurized ; assure that no excess air (beyond the volume of product to be withdrawn) is 
inserted into the vial prior to withdrawing the product.  After use the vial should be returned to 
refrigeration.  
Subjects  or their caregivers will administer SC injections of Acthar Gel  or placebo after 
randomly assigned to treatment at Visit [ADDRESS_840347]’s caregiver will administer 
the first dose of study drug and the first dose of Acthar Gel in the Open -Label at Week [ADDRESS_840348]’s caregiver at home, but no dose shoul d be 
administered on study visit days . 
IMP cannot be t aken on 2 consecutive days and cannot be taken more than 3 days apart.  
Therefore the following  dosing  schedule should be recommended to subjects at Visit 2 , dose 
administration  on either  Monday and Thursday, Tuesday and Friday, or Wednesday and 
Saturday , and would be determined by [CONTACT_630030] 2 occurred.   
In the double -blind treatment period Acthar Gel , 1 mL (80 U) or matching placebo (1 mL) 
will be administered twice weekly SC for up to 24 weeks. In the optional open -label 
extension , Acthar Gel 1 mL (80 U) will be administered SC twice weekly for up to 24 weeks.  
If a dose reduction of IMP is deemed necessary , a reduction of 50% (40 U) may be 
implemented once during the study  based on safety criteria previously defined (see 
Section  8.1). The justification for dose reduction will be captured in the eCRF.  
Subjects who , despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574] , continue to experience any of the AE defined in 
Section  8.1, will be withdrawn from the study due to AE.  
Subject who required dose reduction  (50%)  will inject 40  U (0.5mL) throughout the study, 
including during the opt ional Open -label Extension Phase , if applicable.

Confidential and Proprietary  12.3.1.  Treatment Discontinuation  
Should any of the following occur, treatment with IMP may be reduced once by 50% 
(Section  8) or should be discontinued:  
• Development of accelerated hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure 
≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg) that cannot be 
managed by [CONTACT_630031].  
• Development of congestive heart failure (Class III or IV) that cannot be managed 
by [CONTACT_630032].  
• Development of uncontrolled diabetic signs/sympt oms that cannot be managed by 
[CONTACT_630033].   
• Development of any other AE of at least moderate intensity and possibly, probably 
or definitely related to IMP that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_630034].  
If the subject is withdrawn due to an AE, all efforts should be made to complete end -of-
treatment procedures (Visit 8 , Section 11.5) as soon as deemed possible and follow -up 
procedures (Visit 12 , Section 11.9). If applicable, the suitability of subject continuing into the 
optional Open-label Extension Phase  will be determined by [CONTACT_093].   
12.4. Storage of Clinical Supplies  
Acthar Gel  and placebo  will be maintained in a temperature controlled, secure  locked area 
with restricted access at the study site.   
Both Acthar Gel  and Placebo  will be supplied in kits containing the appropriate amount of 
vials . Both Acthar Gel  and placebo will be stored under refrigeration between 2 °to 8°C 
(36°to 46°F). Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for complete information regarding storage 
and accountab ility of IMP.  
12.5. Drug Accountability  
In accordance with US FDA and ICH requirements, the investigator  will, at all times, be able 
to account for all IMP furnished to the study site. A drug accountability record will be 
maintained for this purpose. The invest igator  must maintain accurate records indicating dates 
and quantity of IMP received, to whom it was dispensed ( subject -by-subject  accounting) and 
accounts of any IMP accidentally or deliberately destroyed. All unused IMP not involved in 
immediate subject  dosing will be maintained under locked , temperature -controlled  storage at 
the study site.  
12.6. Compliance  Monitoring  
Prior to beginning the administration of IMP, subjects and/or their caregiver will be trained on 
dosing  and SC injection, and must exhibit proper technique of SC administration  during initial 
IMP administration at Visit 2 . Subjects and/or their caregiver will be trained on the 
Protocol MNK14344100  Acthar® Gel (Repository Corticotrop in Injection)

reports. The  clinical significance of each laboratory abnormality will be documented. New 
clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or clinically significant changes in laboratory 
values will be reported as AEs, as appropriate.  
In addition:  
All female subjects o f child bearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at Screening  
(Visit 1) . Urine pregnancy tests will be done at all other visits throughout the study. Results 
must be available prior to dosing with IMP. Subjects with positive results will be ineligible for 
study entry (Visit  1 or Visit 2 ) or immediately withdrawn from the study  (Visit 3 through 
Visit 11 ) and the pregnancy report ed as per Section  16.5. 
HBsAg and HBcAb  will be performed at Screening  (Visit 1). Results of these tests must be 
negative or nonreactive for subjects to qualify for the study.   
HCV will be performed at Screening  (Visit  1). A positive HCV will automatically trigger a  
HCV PCR analysis.  HCV PCR must be < 25 IU/mL  to qualify for the study.  
IGRA  for TB will be performed at Screening  (Visit 1). Results of this test must be negative 
for subjects to qualify for the study.

Protocol MNK14344100  Acthar® Gel (Repository Corticotrop in Injection)  
Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_840354] recent version of the Package Insert  
(Mallinckrodt ARD LLC, 2019 ).  
16.2. Definitions  
AE  
An AE is any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in a subject  who is administered an 
IMP, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
• Clinically significant laboratory findings . 
• Clinically significant changes in physical examination findings . 
• An AE occurring due to IMP overdose whether accidental or intentional . 
• An AE occurring from investigational medicinal abuse . 
• An AE associated with investigational medicinal withdrawal . 
• Unexpected AE. 
An unexpected AE is defined as an AE, the nature and severity of which is not consisten t with 
the applicable product information in the most recent version of the package insert 
(Mallinckrodt ARD LLC, 2019 ). 
Adverse experiences (serious or non -serious) that commonly occur in the study population or 
back ground regimen will be considered anticipated events. Such events include known 
consequences of the underlying disease (disease -related) or condition under inves tigation (eg,  
symptoms, disease progression) and events unlikely to be related to the underlying disease or 
condition under investigation but common in the study population independent of drug 
therapy.  Anticipated events, when reported, to be associated with the use of the investigational 
product, are a subset of unexpected AEs (events not listed in the packag e insert 
[Mallinckrodt  ARD LLC, 2019 ]). However, these events do not warrant expedited re porting 
as individual cases when serious criteria have been met because it is not possible to determine 
that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. As a result, they do not 
meet the definition of a suspected adverse reaction.  
SAE  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of the 
following outc omes:  
• Death . 
• A life -threatening AE . 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions .

Protocol  Version 2 Amendment 1  
 
72 
Confidential and Proprietary  • Results in a congenital anomaly/bir th defect . 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical interv ention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency department  or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.   
Death  
Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in death should be recorded  and 
reported on the SAE Form. All causes of death must be reported as SAEs. The investigator 
should make every effort to obtain and send death certificates and autopsy reports  (if

Life-Threatening Event  
A life -threatening event refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred per the 
reporter. A life -threatening event  does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death but, as it actually occurred, did not create an immediate 
risk of death. For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would 
not be c onsidered life -threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. 
Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life -
threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaph ylaxis 
can be fatal.

Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_840355]  Relatedness  
The following classifications should be used when evaluating the relationsh ip of AEs or SAEs 
to study treatment ( Table 3). 
Table 3:  AE Relationships  
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related  No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
treatment; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or 
subject ’s clinical state.  
Unlikely Related  The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship is unl ikely.  
Possibly Related  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the study treatment and follows a known response pattern to the suspected 
study treatment. The reaction might have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s 
clinical  state or other modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Related  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the study treatment and follows a known response pattern to the suspected 
study treatment and can be confirm ed with a positive re -challenge test or 
supporting laboratory data.  
 
Severity Assessment  
For purposes of consistency, if required , the investigator may use the intensity grades 
presented in  Table 4.  
Table 4:  AE Severity Grades  
Grade  Definition  
Mild  Does not interfere with subject 's usual function and activities  
Moderate  Interferes to some extent with subject 's usual function and activities  
Severe  Interferes significantly with subject 's usual function and activities  
 
If an AE increases in severity (eg, from moderate to severe); decreases in severity (eg, 
changes from moderate to mild); or there is a change in seriousness, a new AE will be opened 
and the original AE will be closed. If an AE is still ongoing at the time of a subject ’s 
completion of the final visit , the resolution/stop date and time is left blank.  
To ensure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided:  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively 
minor medical importance (such as a sever e headache). This is not the same as “serious,”

that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide 
for defining r egulatory reporting obligations.  
16.4. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording and 
Reporting  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded  from signing of the ICF through completion of the follow -up 
visit, which will take place 4 weeks  (± 2 days) after the subject has  received the last 
administration of IMP. The investigator is required to record  the AE or SAE regardless of the 
severity of the event or  its relationship to study treatment. The investigator must follow up on 
all AEs and SAEs until the even t has resolved  or stabilized or at such time  the investigator  
refers the subject  to a nonstudy physician. The investigator will document the further follow -
up information in the subject ’s source document.   
During the period specified above, the investigator will:  
Record  all AEs and SAEs  in the source documents  from the signing of the ICF  through the 
completion of  the follow -up telephone call.  
Record all AEs and SAEs in the eCRF from the initial IMP dose through the completion of 
the follow -up telephone call .  
Report all  SAEs on an SAE Report Form to Mallinckrodt Pharmacovigilance . 
Report all pregnancies to Mallinckrodt  Pharmacovigilance on the Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form . 
Submit the Safety Alert from Mallinckrodt to the IRB /IEC . (Submit any Expedited Safety 
Report or Sus pected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction from Global Pharmacovigilance 
to the IRB/IEC. ) 
The reporting requirements for AEs are summarized in Table 5.

AEs 
AEs can be reported spontaneously or elicited during open -ended questioning ( ie, "How have 
you been feeling since your last visit?"), examinati on, or evaluation of a subject . Signs and 
symptoms must be recorded using standard medical terminology.

Confidential and Proprietary  All fields on the AE CRF page should be completed for each event with a full description of 
the event and date and time of onset/start and resolution/stop. A medical diagnosis if kno wn, 
should be recorded in lieu of each individual sign and symptom associated with the diagnosis 
and experienced by [CONTACT_423] . If no medical diagnosis is known, the term used by [CONTACT_630037] d be recorded.  
SAEs 
Initial Reporting  
SAEs  (based on US FDA/ICH definition of an SAE) require immediate reporting to 
Mallinckrodt  Global Pharmacovigilance  or designated representative.  
• For all fatal or life -threatening events, the investigator , or design ee, must report 
information to the MM.  
• For all SAEs, the investigator , or designee , must complete the SAE Report Form 
with the minimum information required by [CONTACT_630038] [ADDRESS_840358] 
knowledge of the event even if the experience does not appear to be related to the 
IMP. 
• The investigator , or designee , will receive acknowledgement of receipt of the SAE 
Report Form from Mallinckrodt.  
• If there is any doubt about whether the information constitutes an SAE, the 
information is to be treated as an SAE.  
The investigator(s) or designee is required to submit the Safety Alert to the responsible 
IRB/I EC. 
The sponsor will submit safety reports  to the US FDA  and other regulatory agencie s, as 
appropriate . 
Follow Up Reporting  
The investigator or designee must complete an SAE Report Form for all follow -up 
information received and fax or e-mail it to Mallinckrodt Global Pharmacovigilance or 
designee  within 24 hours  of receipt (eg, detailed written descriptions that include copi[INVESTIGATOR_629983], autopsy reports and other supporting documents). The investigator(s) 
or designee will receive acknowledgement of receipt for each SAE Report Form from 
Mallinckrodt.

The subject will remain in the

symptom atic 
sarcoidosis treated with 
repository corticotropin 
injection (Chopra et al., 
2019).  Section 7.[ADDRESS_840387] study was large case series of 
patients with advanced symptomatic 
sarcoidosis treated with repository 
corticotropin injection (RCI). This large 
case series study describes patient 
characteristics, RCI utilization patterns, 
concomitant the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and physicians’ 
assessments of treatment response. The 
study included 302 patients 
(mean  age = 51 years; 52% women) with a 
mean of 4.[ADDRESS_840388] patients (76%) had 
extrapulmonary involvement, primarily in 
the skin (28%), joints (25%), heart (22%), 
and eyes (22%); 34% had multiple (≥2) 
organ involvement. The mean duration of 
RCI treatment was 32.5 weeks, with 
61.6% of patients continuing RCI therapy

for ≥6 months. The RCI utilization 
pattern indicated an indiv idualized 
approach to therapy, with a higher 
starting dose associated with a shorter 
duration of therapy compared with a 
lower starting dose. The percentage of 
patients who used corticosteroids 
decreased from 61.3% during the 3 
months before initiation of RCI to 12.9% 
at 3 months after RCI therapy; the mean 
daily dose of corticosteroid decreased 
from 18.2 mg to 9.9 mg. The proportion of 
patients given <10 mg/day of prednisone 
increased from 21% before RCI use to 
47% at 3 months after RCI use. 
According to p hysicians’ assessments of 
change in patients’ health status after RCI 
therapy, overall status improved in 95% 
of patients, overall symptoms in 73%, 
lung function in 38%, and inflammation 
in 33%. The findings suggest that RCI is a 
viable treatment option fo r patients with 
advanced symptomatic sarcoidosis and 
provide insights on patient characteristics 
and practice patterns to help clinicians 
determine appropriate use (Chopra et al., 
2019).

MCRs  pi[INVESTIGATOR_629987]. Further down in the 
same paragraph:  
MCRs play a key role in regulating 
inflammation and other cellular function 
(Catania, 2010). Acthar engages MCRs 
expressed on immune cells and other 
tissues throughout the body and is thought 
to produce both an indirect anti -
inflammatory effect and a direct cell effect 
(Catania, 2010; Wright et al., 2019; Olsen 
et al., 2015; Healy , 2017a; Wright et al., 
2019b). Production of cortisol is mediated 
by [CONTACT_630011]2Rs primarily 
expressed on the adrenal cortex. In in 
vitro studies in cultured cells lines 
expressing MCR1 -MCR5, the relative 
functional potency of MCRs was 
measured. It was shown that 6% of 
Acthar’s relative functional potency 
occurred at MC2R. The remaining 94% 
occurred at the other MCRs (Wright et 
al., 2019). These data suggest that Acthar 
acts directly on cells involved in the 
pathogenesis of disease in addition to its  
indirect action via corticosteroid 
stimulation.  
The effects of Acthar on human B -
lymphocyte function in vitro were 
evaluated using highly purified B -cell 
populations cultured in the absence of

glucocorticoids and stimulated by 
[CONTACT_630012] -4 and cluster of 
differentiation 40 ligand as specific B -cell 
activating signals. Immunoglobulin G was 
measured in supernatants from healthy 
human peripheral B cells that had been 
cultured for 6 days. The percentage of 
cells that divided and immunoglobulin G 
production were assessed under basal 
conditions (unstimulated) or stimulated 
with interleukin -4/cluster of 
differentiation 40 ligand plus vehicle. 
Acthar reduced B cell proliferation and 
immunoglobulin G production 
independent of cortisol release (p<0.05, 
compared to vehicle -treated group) 
(Olsen  et al., 2015; Healy, 2017a, Healy, 
2017b). In further experiments to explore 
the direct effects of Acthar on human 
macrophages and focusing on induction of 
pro-inflammatory mediators following 
lipopolysaccharide sti mulation, Acthar 
inhibited the production of the pro -
inflammatory cytokines interleukin -6 and 
tumor necrosis factor (p<0.0001, 
compared to vehicle -treated group; 
(Healy, 2017a, Healy, 2017b). These data 
further demonstrate a direct effect of 
Acthar on immu ne cell modulation 
independent of cortisol release.

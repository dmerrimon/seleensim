 SYNOPSIS  Sponsor: Theracos Sub, LLC Name [CONTACT_2756]: Bexagliflozin Tablets, 20 mg  Name [CONTACT_3261]: Bexagliflozin Study Title: An Integrated Assessment of the Safety and Effectiveness of Bexagliflozin Tablets, 20 mg, for the Management of Essential Hypertension Protocol Number: THR-1442-C-603 Study Phase:  2/3 
Overall Design : 
This integrated ass essment consists of two studies, 603A and 603B, to be carried out 
sequentially in a common study population.  Participating subjects will be informed of the 
trial design and their consent to participate in  both studies will be obtained  in a single consent 
form . Primary Objective of Study 603A In study 603A, the effectiveness of bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, will be assessed in a study population randomized 1:1 to receive either active agent or placebo. The primary endpoint will be the change from baseline (Day 1) to week 12 of the average ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the bexagliflozin group compared to the placebo group. Secondary Objectives of Study 603A Additional effectiveness outcomes will be assessed from ambulatory as well as seated office blood pressure measurements. Secondary endpoints based on mean ambulatory SBP will include the proportion of subjects who achieve a reduction of mean ambulatory SBP of 10 mm Hg or greater and the proportion of subjects who achieve a mean ambulatory SBP of 135 mm Hg or less at week 12. Secondary endpoints based on seated office SBP will include the placebo-adjusted change from baseline to week 12 in seated office SBP and the proportion of subjects who achieve a mean seated office SBP of 140 mm Hg or less at week 12. Secondary endpoints based on mean ambulatory DBP will include: the placebo-adjusted change in mean ambulatory DBP from baseline to week 12; the proportion of subjects who achieve a mean ambulatory DBP of 87 mm Hg or less at week 12; and the proportion of subjects who achieve a reduction of mean ambulatory DBP of [ADDRESS_500717] (peak-trough ratio) by [CONTACT_397905] 12.

Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_500718] b e dosed with bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, for 12 weeks. At week 12 the 
participants will undergo a 1:1 randomization to bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, or placebo. The 
primary endpoint will be the change from week 12 to week 24 of the mean ambulatory SBP 
of the bexagliflozin group compared to the placebo group.  
Secondary Objectives of Study 603B  
The secondary objectives of study 603B are  based on s eparate assessments of effects on 
mean ambulatory and seated office systoli c and diastolic blood pressures.  
Study 603B will also include a population pharmacokinetic assessment between weeks 6 and 
12, when all participants will be receiving bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg.  
Integrative Objectives of Study 603A and 603B  
Integration of m easures collected in studie s 603A  and 603B will be used to assess consistent 
effects on mean ambulatory SBP/DBP after [ADDRESS_500719] as a function of time.  Integrated Safety Objectives: The integrated safety objectives will assess the hazard ratio for adverse events associated with bexagliflozin exposure compared to placebo in all segments of both studies in which a placebo-exposed cohort is present. The assessments will include: • the frequency and severity of all adverse events • the frequency and severity of adverse events of special interest • changes in concomitant medication use • changes in laboratory test values • changes in cardiac rhythm determined by 12-lead ECG • changes in vital signs • effects on general health detected by [CONTACT_397906]:  THR-1442-C-603 is an integrated assessment of the potential utility of bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is composed of two studies, 603A and 603B, measuring effects in a common population. Study 603A  Approximately 680 male or female adult subjects who exhibit an office seated blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and <180 mm Hg, and who are taking no more than 4 anti-hypertension medications will be enrolled in study 603A. In the desired population, > 10% of the subjects will have a baseline ABPM >160 mm Hg and < 30% of the subjects will have type 2 diabetes

 mellitus.  
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at the screening visit (visit 1) will st art a [ADDRESS_500721] been 
compliant in taking the run -in medication, and who exhibit a seated SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and <  
[ADDRESS_500722] dose of run -in drug, will be fitted with an ABPM device and will start a 24 -h 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to establish the baseline ABPM SBP and 
DBP.  On the following day, qualified subjects who have completed the 24 -h ABPM with a 
mean 24 -h SBP ≥ 135 mm Hg will be randomly assigned to receive bexagliflozin tablets, 20 
mg or placebo, using an interactive web resp onse system (IWRS).  If <  [ADDRESS_500723] be repeated within 2 days .  Prior to randomization, subjects who 
cannot successfully complete the ABPM within two attempts will be considered screen 
failures.  
Randomization will be strat ified according to  diabetes status ( history of T2DM or not ), renal 
function (eGFR ≥  60 or not) , presently medicated for hypertension  or not, and ABPM SB P (< 
160 mm Hg or not).   
A bottle of double blind study drug will be dispensed to each randomized subje ct with  an 
instruction to take one tablet daily in the morning with a glass of water before or after 
breakfast.  It will be recommended that subjects take the study drug at about the same time 
every day except on the days of scheduled site visit when the s tudy drug will be administered 
at the investigational site .    
A six week visit to the investigational site will allow seated office measures of systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure to be recorded.  
At week 12 (end of study), the subject will visit the investigational site, consume the final 
tablet, and be fitted for AB PM.  
An interim non -binding futility analysis will be conducted  when approximate 50% of the 
randomized subjects have completed study 603A .  The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_397907]. Results from the analysis 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_23275] (DMC).  
Study 603B 
Upon returning to the investigational site to surrender  the ambulatory monitor  at the 
conclusion of study 603A , subjects will begin participation in study 603B. They will receive 
a 12-week supply of bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg.  
At week 6 (cumulative week 18) subjects will return to the investigational site for 
measurement of seated  systolic and diastolic blood pressures.  
At week 12  (cumulative week 24)  subjects will visit the investigational site to consume the 
bexagliflozin tablet and to be fitted with an ambulatory monitor to record their baseline mean 
blood pressure.  
The followi ng day, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive a 12-week supply of

 bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg or bexagliflozin tablets, placebo.  Assignment to the active or 
placebo arm will be balanced to approximately equalize the representation in each arm of the 
following groups:  
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a > 20 mm Hg 
reduction in mean SBP between  Day 1 and cumulative  24 
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a > 5 mm Hg 
and ≤ 20 mm H g reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumulative 24  
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a ≤ 5 mm Hg 
reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumulative 24  
• Subjects requiring rescue medication prior to week 24  
 
An asse ssment of bexagliflozin population pharmacokinetics (PK) will also be conducted , to 
include approximately 200 subjects. Samples will be taken between weeks 6 and 12. The 
population PK study design and analysis plan will be described in a separate designate d study 
protocol and the analysis will be reported separately.  
Integrated management of hypertension, including use of rescue medications  
Subjects will be counseled to be compliant with all their medications, to exercise  regularly, 
lose weight if overweigh t or obese,  adopt  a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low -fat dairy 
products (the DASH diet, with appropriate modifica tions for participants with CKD),  reduce  
sodium intake and alcohol consumption to recommended levels. Patients who smoke will be 
encoura ged to stop.  Every effort will be made to secure the continued participation of the 
subjects . 
Rescue medications are recommended following the guidance below if the SBP shows an 
increase of 30 mm Hg from baseline or exceeds 189 mm Hg in office measurements  over 3 
consecutive days.

 Assessments for studies 603A and 603B will be combined to further assess the effectiveness of bexagliflozin after treatment of 12, 24, and 36 weeks. There are four (4) separate treatment sequences after combining studies 603A and 603B, namely:  Sequence  Period 1  Period 2  Period 3  Seq 1 PBB  (603A) placebo  (603B) bexagliflozin  (603B) bexagliflozin  Seq 2 PBP  (603A) placebo  (603B) bexagliflozin  (603B) placebo  Seq 3 BBB  (603A) bexagliflozin  (603B) bexagliflozin  (603B) bexagliflozin  Seq 4 BBP  (603A) bexagliflozin  (603B) bexagliflozin  (603B) placebo   The following assessments will be assessed: • Change in mean ambulatory SBP or DBP after 12 weeks treatment of bexagliflozin using week 12 assessments for Seq 3 or 4’s Period 1 and Seq 1 or 2’s Period 2; • Change in mean ambulatory SBP or DBP after 24 weeks treatment of bexagliflozin using cumulative week 24 assessments for Seq 3 or 4’s Period 2 and Seq 1’s Period 3; • Change in mean ambulatory SBP or DBP after 36 weeks treatment of bexagliflozin using cumulative week 36 assessments for Seq 3’s Period 3; • Change in seated office SBP or  DBP after 12 weeks treatment of bexagliflozin using week 12 assessments for Seq 3 or 4’s Period 1 and Seq 1 or 2’s Period 2; • Change in seated office SBP or DBP after 24 weeks treatment of bexagliflozin using cumulative week 24 assessments for Seq 3 or 4’s Period 2 and Seq 1’s Period 3; • Change in seated office SBP or DBP after 36 weeks treatment of bexagliflozin using cumulative week 36 assessments for Seq 3’s Period 3.  PK Assessments: Samples for population PK analysis will be collected and the required plasma concentrations determined. The PK parameters will be assessed separately as part of the population PK analysis. Safety Assessments:  Safety will be assessed based on an analysis of the adverse events identified by [CONTACT_397909], laboratory data, including hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, urinary electrolytes and creatinine measurements; by [CONTACT_397910], measurements of vital signs and physical examinations; and by [CONTACT_397911].   Statistical Methods:   
The primary endpoint of study 603A is the change from baseline (Day 1)  to week 12 in the 
24-hour average SBP of the bexagliflozin group compared to the placebo  group using a 
superiority testing at an overall two -sided 0.05 level of significance.   
The primary endpoint of study  603B is the change from week 12 ( cumulative week 24 ) to 
week 24 (cumulative week 36) in the  24-hour average SBP in the bexagliflozin group 
compared to the placebo group using a superiority testing at an overall two -sided 0.05 level

 of significance.  
The assumptions to estimate the sample size for the primary endpoint of study  603A  are: 
1. The magnitude of the decrease f rom baseline to week 12 of the 24 h mean SBP in the 
bexagliflozin treatment arm will exceed that found in the placebo arm by 5 mm  Hg; 
2. The standard deviation of the change from baseline to Week 12 will be  15 mm  Hg for 
both the active and placebo groups;  
3. The two-sided significance level is 0.05 . 
 
The assumptions to estimate the sample size required for the primary endpoint of study 603B 
are: 
1. Bexagliflozin will remain effective for at least [ADDRESS_500734] 85% power to attain 
significance for the primary endpoint  of study  603B . It is estimated that 75% of subjects will 
complete the [ADDRESS_500735] randomization. Thus a total 
sample size of 680 subjects is planned for study  603A . It is estimated that approximately 8% 
of subjects will have ceased to participate by [CONTACT_209565] 603A. A sample size of 626 
subjects at the conclusion of study 603A will provide >95% power for the primary endpoint.  
An interim non -binding futility analysis when  [ADDRESS_500736] statistics (Z score) is less than 0.656 (or p -value  > 0.512).  The overall power 
for the first primary endpoint remains >95% with this inter im look.  The interim analysis will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_397912].  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method will be used in 603A for analyzing the mean 
change from baseline 24-hour average  SBP at week 12, adjusted by [CONTACT_284680] , renal

 1 INTRODUCTION  
Hypertension affects one billion people worldwide, including 30% of U.S adults. The 
incidence of hypertension is expected to continue to rise, especially given current trends in 
the prevalence of obesity and diabetes (Egan et al., 2010 ). Unfortunately, only half of those 
afflicted achieve goal blood pressure targets (James et al., 2014 ). Hypertension is a major 
preventable  risk factor for cardiovascular disease. There is a direct correlation between 
adverse outcomes and increasing blood pressure over 115/75 mm Hg  (Lewington et al., 
2002 ). Thus, novel anti -hypertensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_66039], especially those that may have 
additional beneficial effects on associated conditions  like diabetes mellitus, obesity and 
chronic kidney disease.  
Bexagliflozin is a specific and potent inhibitor of sodium -glucose linked transporter 2 
(SGLT2).  SGLT2 is responsible for the reabsorption of most of the glucose passing through 
the S1 and S2 s egments of the renal proximal tubule by a 1:1 cotransport of sodium ions and 
glucose (Hummel et al., 2012 ; Kanai et al., 1994 ). Inhibiting SGLT2 action leads to 
glucosuria and natriuresis. The mechanism of the natriuresis is thought to be at least partially  
dependent on osmotic diuresis. Individuals affected by [CONTACT_397913] (FRG), a 
syndrome resulting from mutations in the gene encoding SGLT2, SLC5A2  (Calado et al., 
2006 ; Calado et al., 2004 ; Calado et al., 2008 ; Francis et al., 2004 ; Kleta et al., 2004 ; Santer 
et al., 2003 ; van den Heuvel et al., 2002 ) present with a prominent glucosuria, mild to 
moderate polyuria, and, in severe cases, evidence of volume depletion attribu table to 
natriuresis. Affected individuals are euglycemic and exhibit no signs of renal tubular 
dysfunction apart from their glucosuria. In extreme cases of FRG, evidence of sodium 
depletion with mild hypotension and a compensatory activation of the renin -angiotensin -
aldosterone system (RAAS) have been noted (Calado et al., 2006 ; Calado et al., 2008 ). 
Several SGLT2 inhibitors have been approved as a single agent or in combination with other 
hypoglycemic agents for the treatment of patients with T2DM (Vivian, 2015 ; Whalen et al., 
2015 ). In clinical studies of diabetic adults, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to produce an 
antihypertensive effect  (Bake r et al., 2014 ; Lovshin and Gilbert, 2015 ; Mancia et al., 2016 ; 
Oliva and Bakris, 2014 ; Reed, 2016 ; Tikkanen et al., 2015 ; Weber et al., 2016 ; Weir et al., 
2014 ) A meta -analysis of 27 randomized controlled trials with 12,960 subjects showed 
SGLT2 inhibitors reduced  systolic blood pressure ( SBP) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) 
by 4.0 and 1.6 mm Hg respectively  (Baker et al., 2014 ). Orthostatic hypotension was rarely 
observed  (Baker et al., 2014 ). Baseline readings were typi[INVESTIGATOR_276898], around 130 mm Hg for 
SBP.  
In a trial assessing the cardiovascular hazards of administration of empagliflozin 
(EMPAREG), diabetic pa tients with increased cardiovascular risk were treated with 
empagliflozin or placebo in combination with standard of care for approximately 3 years. 
The primary composite outcome of death, MI, and stroke (MACE) occurred in 10.5% of 
patients in the empaglif lozin groups and in 12.1% of the patients in the placebo group. 
Empagliflozin has shown decreased rates of eGFR decline in those with mild and moderate 
chronic kidney disease (Zinman et al., 2015 ). SBP decreased over the course of the treatment 
period in empagliflozin arms compared to placebo (Scheen, 2016 ).

 1.1 Bexagliflozin  for the Treatment  of Hypertension  
Bexagliflozin is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the SGLT2 with an in vitro IC 50 of 
2 nM or 0.9 ng/mL and a [ADDRESS_500748] observable dose level in  male rats, as well as signs of reversible 
cardiac inflammation and abdominal distension at a dose level of 200 mg/kg in monkeys. 
Details of the adverse findings are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.1.2  Summary  of Bexagliflozin Clinical  Data   
Theracos has completed multiple phase 1 studies to evaluate safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and drug metabolism in healthy subjects, 
subjects with T2DM, and diabetic subjects with renal impairment. Bexagliflozin was well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_397914] (UGE) and decreases in blood pressure.  
In a [ADDRESS_500749] dose.  Among the patients with 
SBP ≥140 mm Hg  at baseline (mean SBP of 147±7.8 mm Hg ), bexagliflozin treatment 
resulted in a placebo corrected SBP reduction of [ADDRESS_500750] 
correlated wit h the baseline BP but was independent of the baseline HbA1c.  Details of the 
pharmacology, efficacy, and safety assessments are described in the Investigator’s Brochure 
and summarized in the following sections.

 2 OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Objectives of Study 603A  
Primary Objective  of 603A  Study  
In study 603A, the effectiveness of bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, will be assessed in a study 
population randomized 1:1 to receive either active agent or placebo. The primary endpoint 
will be the change from baseline  (Day 1)  to week  12 of the average ambulatory systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) of the bexagliflozin group compared to the placebo group . 
Secondary Objectives of Study 603A  
Additional effectiveness outcomes will be assessed from ambulatory as well as seated office 
blood press ure measurements.  
Secondary endpoints based on mean ambulatory SBP will include the proportion of subjects 
who achieve a reduction of mean ambulatory SBP of 10 mm Hg or greater and the proportion 
of subjects who achieve a mean ambulatory SBP of 135 mm Hg o r less at week 12.  
Secondary endpoints based on seated office SBP will include the placebo -adjusted change 
from baseline to week 12 in seated office SBP and the proportion of subjects who achieve a 
mean seated office SBP of 140 mm Hg or less at week 12.  
Secondary endpoints based on mean ambulatory DBP will include: the placebo -adjusted 
change in mean ambulatory DBP from baseline to week 12; the proportion of subjects who 
achieve a mean ambulatory DBP of 87 mm Hg or less at week 12; and the proportion of 
subjects who achieve a reduction of mean ambulatory DBP of [ADDRESS_500752] (peak -trough ratio) by [CONTACT_397905] [ADDRESS_500753] be dosed with bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg, for 12 weeks. At week 12 the

 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Design and Plan  
3.1.1  Study 603A  
Approximately 680 male or female adult subjects who exhibit an office seated blood pressure 
≥ 140 mm Hg and <  180 mm Hg, and who are taking no more than 4 anti -hypertension 
medications will be enrolled in study 603A . In the desired population, > 10% of the subjects 
will have a baseline ABPM >  160 mm Hg and < 30% of the subjects will have type 2 
diabetes mellitus.  
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at the screening visit (visit 1) will start a [ADDRESS_500758] been 
compliant in taking the run -in medication, and who exhibit a seated SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and 
< [ADDRESS_500759] dose of run -in drug, will be fitted with an A BPM device and will start a 24 -h 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to establish the baseline ABPM SBP and 
DBP.  On the following day, qualified subjects who have completed the 24 -h ABPM with a 
mean 24 -h SBP ≥ 135 mm Hg will be randomly assigned t o receive bexagliflozin tablets, 
20 mg or placebo, using an interactive web response system (IWRS).  If < [ADDRESS_500760] be repeated within 2 days.  Prior to randomization, subjects 
who cannot successfully complete the ABPM wit hin two attempts will be considered screen 
failures.  
Randomization will be stratified according to diabetes status (history of T2DM or not), renal 
function (eGFR ≥ 60 or not), presently medicated for hypertension or not, and ABPM SBP 
(< 160 mm Hg or not).   
A bottle of double blind study drug will be dispensed to each randomized subject with an 
instruction to take one tablet daily in the morning with a glass of water before or after 
breakfast.  It will be recommended that subjects take the study drug at abo ut the same time 
every day except on the days of scheduled site visit when the study drug will be administered  
at the investigational site.  
A six week visit to the investigational site will allow seated office measures of systolic and 
diastolic BP to be re corded.  
At week 12 (end of study), the subject will visit the investigational site, consume the final 
tablet, and be fitted for ABMP.  
An interim non -binding futility analysis is planned when approximately 50% of the 
randomized subjects  (i.e., 300)  have co mpleted study 603A.  The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_397916]. Results from the analysis 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_23275] (DMC).

Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_500761] their baseline mean blood pressure.  
The following day, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive a 12 -week supply of 
bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg or bexagliflozin tablets, placebo. Assignment to the active or 
placebo arm will be balanced to approximately equalize the representation in each arm of the 
following groups:  
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a > 20 mm Hg 
reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumulative 24  
• Subjects  not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and  exhibiting a > 5 mm Hg 
and ≤ 20 mm Hg reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumulative 24  
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a ≤ 5 mm Hg 
reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumulative 24  
• Subjects requiring rescue medication prior to week 24  
 
An assessment of bexagliflozin population pharmacokinetics (PK) will also be conducted to 
include approximately 200 subjects. Samples will be taken between weeks 6 and 12. The 
population PK study design and analysis plan will be described in a designated study 
protocol and the analysis will be reported separately.  
3.1.3  Integrated Management of Hypertension, Including Use of Rescue 
Medications  
Subjects will be counseled to be compliant with all their medications, to exercise regularly, 
lose weight if overweight or obese, adopt a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low -fat dairy 
products (the DASH diet, with appropriate modifications for participants with CKD), reduce 
sodium intake and alcohol consumption to recommended levels. Patients who smoke will be 
encourage d to stop (CDC guidance).  
Rescue medications are recommended following the guidance below if the SBP shows an 
increase of 30 mm Hg from baseline or exceeds 189 mm Hg in office measurements over 3 
consecutive days.

 3.2.2  Rationale for the Selected Dose  and Once daily Do sing Regimen  
The pharmacodynamics of bexagliflozin can be  directly measured by  [CONTACT_397917] (UGE). The UGE data from healthy volunteers are fit by a logistic 
equation with maximum effect size of 76.3 g/24 h and an ED 50 of 3.63 mg. The proposed 
doses of 20 mg are predicted to produce 85% of the maximum effect. Doses of [ADDRESS_500772] dose dependence of adver se event accrual 
was observed.  
The risk of induced hypoglycemia as a consequence of the inhibition of SGLT2 activity is 
low based on published data reporting  the euglycemic status of individuals with genetic 
mutations in SLC5A2  (the gene encoding SGLT2), i n subjects that have been treated with 
other SGLT2 inhibitors, and from previous clinical studies in healthy or diabetic subj ects 
treated with bexagliflozin . The p otential risk of diuretic effect s such as hypotension or 
electrolyte imbalance has been  monit ored. There has been one event each of hyponatremia  
(on day 99 ), hypokalemia  (on day 86 ), and hypotension  (on day 284 ) among study subjects 
who have received daily doses of 20 mg bexagliflozin in completed studies . The incidence 
rate for all electrolyte ev ents is approximately 0.2%.  
Bexagliflozin is formulated as a prolonged release tablet .  The average plasma concentrati on 
is above 10 ng/mL at [ADDRESS_500773] this consideration.  The target population will contain adequate representation 
of poorly controlled hypertensives  (greater than 10% of the total randomized population must 
have mean 24 h SBP ≥  160 mm Hg .). Although diabetes and hypertension are common 
comorbidities, the target population will consist of no more than  30% of subjects with both 
conditions, to avoid possible confounding influences attributable to potential effects specific 
to this population.  
3.3 Study Duration and Dates

A new bottle will be assigned to the sub ject every 12 weeks by [CONTACT_397919] 3, 6, and 9.  
There are two randomization procedures planned in this program , at visit 3 and visit 9 
(Appendix 1 ).  
Subjects who complete the run -in period  and meet the ABPM SBP ≥ 135 mm Hg  criterion at 
visit 3 will be randomized  to receive a bottle of bexagliflozin, 20  mg or placebo.  Subjects 
will be assigned to each group in a 1:1 ratio.  Randomization will be stratified according to  
diabetes status (history o f diabetes or not), baseline ABPM SBP (≥  160 mm Hg  or not) , 
unmedicated or not, and renal function (eGFR ≥  60 or not). The investigator or designated 
staff will log into the IWRS to receive the randomization code and assigned kit number for 
bexagliflozin t ablets, active or placebo.

the representation in each arm of the following groups:  
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a > 20 mm Hg 
reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumula tive 24  
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a > 5 mm Hg 
and ≤ 20 mm Hg reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumulative 24  
• Subjects not requiring rescue medication prior to week 24 and exhibiting a ≤ 5 mm Hg 
reduction in mean SBP between Day 1 and cumulative 24  
• Subjects requiring rescue medication prior to week [ADDRESS_500791] randomization will be deactivated for all sites when the planned number of subjects 
is met and a minimum of 10% of the subjects have an average 24 h ABPM SBP ≥ 160 and 
< [ADDRESS_500792] double -blind treatment phases.  The sponsor  study management team , 
investigators, study coordinators, pharmacists,  study subjects  and cardiovascular  endpoint 
committee  (CEC) will be blinded to the study medications .  
To maintain blinding of the individual treatment assignment, the results of urinary glucose 
testing will not be made available to any study personnel or subjects. If knowl edge of the test 
results is needed to manage a subject’s condition, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_397920]. If unblinding occurs for any reason, the time and reason for 
breaking the blind will be recorded on the case repo rt form (CRF) and the sponsor must be 
notified within [ADDRESS_500793] be submitted to regulatory agenc ies.

 The treatment assignment will continue to be withheld from the CEC adjudication committee 
members until all global investigational studies are completed and final analyses to assess 
cardiovascular risks are conducted.   
There is a planned interim futi lity analysis after approximately 50% of the randomized  
subjects (i.e., 300) have received at least [ADDRESS_500795] of care guidance documents. Subjects will be allowed to take 
any medications or medicinal supplements prescribed except another SGLT2 inhibitor 
(Appendix 4 ) to manage medical conditions during the study. Any concurrent medication or 
supplemental treatment of other medical conditions should be continued at a stable dose and 
frequency for the entire study duration unless there is a clinical reason to change the dose or 
frequency.  
Subjects may receive any medications for AEs that are necessary in the investigators’ 
judgment. Medications prescribed after the informed consent is signed are to be recorded on 
the CRF. The medication name, dose, frequency, route of ad ministration, date(s) of 
administration, and reason for administration must be recorded. This documentation should 
continue through the treatment period s.  
Medications that are prescribed for non -blood pressure modifying purpose but are known to 
cause bloo d pressure change should be used judiciously.  For example, using a beta -blocker 
to manage unstable angina may lower blood pressure. Other examples of medications that are 
frequently prescribed in this population are provided in Appendix 5. 
5.7 Hypertension Re scue Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
A rescue medication is defined as a dose increase of an existing blood pressure medication or 
initiation of a new blood pressure medication for the purpose of lowering blood pressure. 
Medications prescribed for other treatment indications ar e not considered rescue medications. 
Investigators can use any approved agent to treat blood pressure above the rescue threshold. 
Titrating up existing medications to the maximally tolerated/recommended doses prior to 
adding additional agents is recommende d.  
Subjects will be counseled to be compliant with all their medications, to exercise regularly, 
lose weight if overweight or obese, adopt a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low -fat dairy 
products (the DASH diet, with appropriate modifications for part icipants with CKD), reduce 
sodium intake and alcohol consumption to recommended levels. Patients who smoke will be 
encouraged to stop (CDC guidance). Every effort will be made to secure the continued 
participation of the subjects.

6.4 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination shall be pe rformed by [CONTACT_397922] ( Appendix 1 ). The examination shall include a general 
assessment of all body systems including the skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, heart, 
lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, and extremities.  
6.5 Abbreviated Physical Examination  
An abbreviated physical examination will include measurement of height at screening V1 
only and a general assessment of the skin, heart, lungs a nd abdomen. The investigator will

 perform abbreviated physical examinations at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Events ( Appendix 1 ), unless clinically indicated.  
6.6 Body Weight  
Body weight will be determined in the visits indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 
1). The weight must be determined using a scale that is calibrated. Every effort should be 
made to use the sam e scale throughout the study duration.  
6.7 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix  1) and will include  sitting,  supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and standing BP measurements, and heart rate. 
Only the BP measured in the seated  position will be used to determine eligibility.  The vital 
signs shall  be obtained before the scheduled blood draw . 
Devices designed to measure BP from the finger or wrist may not be used. BP shall  be 
measured using an appropriately sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80% of the arm) 
that is applied on the upper arm at heart level. The left arm and same cuff size should be used 
for each measurement at all visits. If the left arm cannot  be used at the screening visit or 
during the study for BP measurements, the reason should be documented, and the right arm 
should be used for BP measurements for all subsequent visits.  
At each visit, BP measurements shall be obtained using a calibrated sp hygmomanometer 
while the subject is in sitting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and standing positions. Prior to measuring seated  BP, 
the subject should be seated quietly in a chair, not an examination table, for at least [ADDRESS_500809] will stand. Standing BP and heart rate will be measured 
after 2 min of standing. For standing BP measurement s, the arm should be supported and 
extended such that the cuff is at heart level. The procedure for vital sign measurement  is 
shown in Figure 2.

6.8 12-Lead ECG  
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) shall be conducted at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Events in Appendix [ADDRESS_500811] abnormalities or arrhythmia.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review the results of the ECG as they become 
available. For each abnormal ECG resul t, the investigator shall ascertain if the observation 
represents a clinically significant change from the screening ECG for that individual 
subject.   This determination does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal 
result is observed. Th e investigator may repeat the ECG to verify the original result. If the 
ECG result is determined to be a clinically significant and abnormal change from baseline for 
that subject, it is considered to reflect an AE.

 LDL -C will be calculated by [CONTACT_6459]. If triglycerides are >  400 mg/dL, the 
calculated LDL -C value is invalid by [CONTACT_272260]. Direct LDL -C 
will be determined in subjects whose triglycerides are >  350 mg/dL at the screening visit. All 
subsequent LDL -C of these subjects will be determined by [CONTACT_272292] -C 
measurements only.  
An investigator can perfor m additional laboratory testing to diagnose or to follow up an 
adverse event progression or resolution. Clinical samples should be analyzed in a local 
laboratory if a fast turnaround is necessary to determine the treatment plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urinalysis  
Urine samples shall be collected routinely at designated clinic visits from a clean catch 
sample. Urinalysis shall be performed at the time points indicated in the schedule of events 
(Appendix 1  and Appendix 2 ). Investigator or staff should document if pre -menopausal 
female subjects are menstruating and note it in the source documents since hematuria is 
likely to be identified on dipstick urinalysis.  
Urine samples will be transported to the central laboratory for urinalysis. Microscopy will be 
conducted if the subject has a positive result on the leukocyte esterase or nitrite dipstick tests 
to clarify the significance of the finding. Results of glucose measu rement in the urinalysis 
must be suppressed from the laboratory reports so the sponsor, investigators, study 
coordinators, pharmacists, study subjects, and the CEC members will remain blinded to the 
dosing assignment.  
In addition, strips to assess leukocyt e esterase and nitrite but not glucose will be provided for 
immediate assessment at the clinical sites. If more than trace positive results are shown in the 
leukocyte esterase and /or nitrite testing, a urine culture should be performed in a  designated 
laboratory regardless of patient reported signs or symptoms. Results of the urinalysis and 
possible urine culture will be documented in the CRFs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Population PK Sampling  
Blood samples for the population PK analysis will be drawn when the subjects return to the  
clinic during  week 18 (V7) and/or week 24 (V8)  from  [ADDRESS_500816] dose 
(routine 1).  Another [ADDRESS_500817]-dose (routine 2). The sampling time should take into con sideration the study subject 
availability  and can be on any of the days during the week of the specified clinical visits. The 
precise  dosing time and sample draw time must be recorded in the CRF.  
Two mL (2 mL) of whole venous blood will be collected from a  peripheral vein. Samples  
will be placed in tubes containing K 2EDTA, stored on ice, and centrifuged under  
refrigeration for at least ten minutes at 3,[ADDRESS_500818] at or belo w -20oC. Processed frozen

 plasma samples will be transferred on dry ice to the analytical laboratory and will be stored at  
or below -20oC until analysis.   
Plasma concentrations of bexagliflozin will be determined by a validated LC -MS/MS  
method. Approximate ly [ADDRESS_500820] dose of run -in drug at the clinic with 1 cup 
(~250  mL) of water.  Subjects shall be instructed to withhold the study drug administration 
on the day of visit [ADDRESS_500821] after the 24 h -ABPM values are 
retrieved and ≥ 51 day time and ≥  [ADDRESS_500822], with one cup 
(250 mL) of liquid . The day of first double blind study drug dosing is considered Day [ADDRESS_500823] should not take the study drug until the visit procedures 
are completed . 
6.11 Efficacy Assessments  
6.11.1  24-h ABPM  
ABPM will be performed for 24 hours, with measurements every 15 minutes during the day 
(16 h) and every 30 minutes during the night ( 8 h).  Subjects will be fitted with the ABPM 
device, administer one tablet of study drug, and wear the cuff for 24 consecutive hours at the 
specified visit ( Appendix 1 ).  Sub jects should take the study drugs while taking all their 
normal medications and performing normal daily activities. Subjects will be instructed to 
refrain from strenuous exercise or shower during this period. The ABPM device will be

dosing.    
If the ABPM is not completed or if < 64 BP readings (51 day time and 13 night time BP 
readings) are recorded, the procedure must be repeated.  A new bottle of double blind study 
drug can be dispensed to a subject only after the [ADDRESS_500825] cannot complete a 24h ABPM 
within two attempts , the data will be considered missing.  
6.11.2  SBP and DBP from office visits BP  
Vital signs will be measured as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 ) and will 
include p ulse, sitting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and standing BP.  Vitals should be measured prior to blood 
draws following the procedures described in Section 6.7.  
6.11.[ADDRESS_500826] be determined using a scale that is calibrated.  The same scale should 
be used throughout the study duration.   
6.11.4  Pulse Pressure  
The pulse pressure will be calculated as the difference between mean systolic and diastolic 
BP of the ABPM.  
6.11.5  Trough/Peak Ratio  
Trough/Peak ratio will be calculated based on  the four valid measurements centered on 
approximate T max ([ADDRESS_500827] -dose) and the four valid measurements immediately prece ding the 
removal of the monitor and prior to administering  a tablet.  
6.12 Adverse Events Assessments  
6.12.1  Definition of Adverse Events  
Adverse event (AE ): Any untoward medical occu rrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal product use.  
Serious adverse event (SAE): A serious AE (SAE) or reaction is any untoward medical 
occurrence that at any dose:  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, LLC

 • results in dea th  
• is life -threatening (NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in this context refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is a medically important event or reaction.  Medical and scientific judg ment should be  
exercised in deciding whether a situation should be considered serious. Important medical 
events which jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse  
 
Adverse Reaction: An adverse reaction  means any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected AEs in which there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused 
the event.  
Expectedness:  
• Defines any adverse events that are expected, based on the Investigator Brochure and 
previous clinical trials.  
• Describe the means for determining and reporting unexpected adverse events.  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction (UADR): An adverse reaction, the nature or severity  
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g . Investigator’s 
Brochure for an unapproved investigational medicinal product).  
Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): A serious UADR.  The 
sponsor must report any suspected S[LOCATION_003]R in an IND safety report (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i)). 
Before submitting an IND safety report, the sponsor needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three of the definitions:  
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
 
Severity: AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated in the CRF. The 
intensity of an AE  is defined as follows:  
1 = Mild: event is medically significant but produces no disruption to daily activity  
2 = Moderate: event is medically significant and reduces or affects normal daily activity  
3 = Severe: event is medically signifi cant and results in inability to work or perform 
normal daily activity  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, LLC  
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_500829] Causality: An assignment made by [CONTACT_272262]. Cases with causal relationship classified as 
possible , probable, or definite are defined as related. Cases with causal relationship 
categorized as not likely or unrelated are defined as not related. Relationship of an AE to 
dosing will be assessed as follows:  
• Definite:  The event responds to withdrawal of the  investigational product (dechallenge), 
and recurs with rechallenge by [CONTACT_272263]  
• Probable:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. The event responds to dechallenge. Rec hallenge is not required  
• Possible:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. Dechallenge is lacking or dechallenge response is unclear  
• Not Likely : There is a temporal relationship to investigational product a dministration, 
but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and 
the event  
• Unrelated:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to investigational product 
administration  
 
6.12.[ADDRESS_500830] consents to participation in the study, the investigator will periodically assess 
subjects for the occurrence of AEs. To avoid bias in collecting information about AEs, the 
investigator should ask subjects the following question: "How have you felt si nce you were 
last checked?" All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_397923].   
It is the investigator's responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they 
become available. For ea ch abnormal laboratory test result, the investigator needs to ascertain 
if this is a clinically significant change from baseline for that individual subject.  This 
determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value  is observed. The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests 
to verify the results of the original laboratory tests. If the laboratory value is determined to be 
a clinically significant and abnormal change from baseline for tha t subject, this is considered 
a laboratory AE.  
In addition, the sponsor’s Medical Monitor or its designated personnel must be notified 
immediately by [CONTACT_756], email, or fax of any immediately reportable AEs (IRAE) 
according to the procedure outlined belo w. Special attention should be paid to recording 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34910].  
6.12.[ADDRESS_500831] report any SAE to the sponsor or its representative immediately after 
the investigator becomes aware of the even t. An SAE form should be completed and sent to 
the sponsor or its representative  within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.

laboratory abnormalities) should be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_500833].  
6.12.4  Pregnancy   
Women of childbearing potential  (WOCBP) are defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who is not permanently sterile or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined 
as [ADDRESS_500834] review guidelines about 
study participation for WOCBP. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_78609]:  
• General information  
• Informed consent form  
• Pregnancy prevention information  
• Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
 
Prior to study enrollment, WOCB P must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The 
subject must sign an informed consent form confirming that the above -mentioned risk factors 
and that the  consequences were discussed with her.  
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_397924] (e.g. missed or late menstrual cycle).  
If a subject or investigator suspects that the sub ject may be pregnant prior to investigational 
product administration, the investigational product administration must be withheld until the 
results of serum pregnancy tests are available. If the pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must 
not receive the inve stigational product and must not be enrolled or remain in the study. If 
pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the investigational 
product must be withheld immediately until the result of the pregnancy test is known. If 
pregnancy is confirmed, the investigational product will be permanently discontinued and the 
subject will be withdrawn from the trial. Exceptions to study discontinuation may be 
considered for life -threatening conditions only after consultations with a sponsor  Medical 
Monitor or designated personnel. The investigator must notify the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_500835] expos ure.  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, LLC  
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_500836] it to 
sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  
Protocol required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on 
the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_397925] ( e.g. x-ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor, on the appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form, 
follow -up information regarding the c ourse of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome. Infants will be followed for a minimum of six months.

treatment during the entire study unless knowledge of the subjec t’s treatment is required for 
clinical care and safety. The Emergency Code Break module in the IWRS is used for such 
situations. The investigator must confirm the intention to unblind the subject’s treatment to 
obtain the dose information in IWRS. Upon com pletion of the unblinding, the system will 
send an alert to designated study team members that an unblinding event has occurred. 
Documentation of breaking the blind should be recorded in the subject’s medical record with 
the date and time the blind was bro ken, and the names of the personnel requesting and 
authorizing unblinding. The treatment assignment will continue to be withheld from the CEC 
members.

Any new SAEs reported by [CONTACT_397926], and are determined by [CONTACT_272268], should be reported to the sponsor or designated personnel. This 
may include SAEs that are captured on follow -up telephone contact [CONTACT_397927] (i.e. up to last scheduled contact). The investigator should 
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, LLC  
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_500839] (AEOI)  
AEOI include the following categories: genital mycotic infections, u rinary tract infections  
including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, d iuretic effects including hypovolemia, hypotension 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], hepatotoxicity, hypoglycemia, falls and  fracture s, malignancies, hypersensitivi ty 
reactions, acid -base disorders including DKA, renal failure events , and major adverse 
cardiovascular events .  AEOI should be monitored carefully and documented in the CRFs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Genital Mycotic Infections (GMIs)   
The investigator shall query the subjects for signs or symptoms that may represent a GMI at 
all clinic visits. GMIs will be diagnosed based on symptoms and, if appropriate, physical 
exam and laboratory findings. Investigators must exclude the possibility of sexually 
transmitted infections before d iagnosing GMI. Diagnosis of GMIs must be documented in 
the CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)  
Events potentially representing UTIs, including cystitis, urethritis, pyelonephritis, or 
urosepsis, should be carefully evaluated.  Documentation of signs, symp toms, culture results 
for infectious agent, and treatment should be undertaken when appropriate.  
The investigator should query the subject at specified clinical visit for symptoms that may be 
related to a UTI and, if appropriate, document these events as symptomatic UTI in the CRF 
unless an alternative diagnosis is present. In addition, a clean catch urine sample will be 
obtained at the time points indicated in the schedule of events  and a urinalysis will be 
performed on that sample at these visits . A positive urinalysis will be defined as one with 
detectable leukocyte esterase and/or nitrites. If the subject reports symptoms consistent with 
a UTI or the urinalysis at the clinical site is positive, a urine culture will be performed at the 
central labora tory. A positive urine culture will be defined as one with 105 CFU of any 
species. The investigator may also perform a urine culture using local resources if necessary 
for clinical care.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatotoxicity  
If plasma AST and/or ALT concentrations > [ADDRESS_500840] in the source documents:  
• the date corresponding to the date of the laboratory abnormality  
• the type, frequency, and dose of any concurrent medications or supplements taken by [CONTACT_237066] 14 days of the det ected abnormality  
• any symptoms or change in physical exam that have occurred since the prior assessment

Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_500841] > [ADDRESS_500842] every 96 hours (4 
days) until ALT and AST return to < 2.[ADDRESS_500843] results are 
stable and significant changes are not expected anymore. Study medication shou ld be 
stopped and the event should be reported as a laboratory AE within the CRF if the enzyme 
elevation is confirmed or worsening.  
Should it be determined that the etiology is an unrelated acute or chronic medical condition 
(e.g.; NASH, Hepatitis A) and the return of LFT abnormalities to normal is unlikely during 
the course of the illness, further testing and follow up is at the investigator’s discretion.  
Hepatotoxicity will be diagnosed and entered as an AE should any of the following occur:  
• ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_500844]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_500845] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_500846] or INR > 1.5  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_500847] with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5 %) 
 
In the event of hepatotoxicity , investigational product should be permanently discontinued. 
The investigator is encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor regarding diagnostic 
evaluation for the hepatic enzyme elevations. Consultation with a hepatologist may also be 
appropriate in some circumstances.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypoglycemia  
Events of hypoglycemia or potentially representing hypoglycemia should be carefully 
evaluated. In the event of signs or symptoms, a diabetic subject is expected to check the 
blood glucose if it is reasonably safe to do so,  and, if appropriate, consume carbohydrates to 
treat hypoglycemia.  
Subjects who have type [ADDRESS_500848] the following 
information for each hypoglycemic event  in the glycemic control diary:  
• Signs and symptoms attributed to hypoglycemia and the time and date on which they 
occurred  
• SMBG reading at the time of the signs and symptoms attributed to hypoglycemia  
• Time elapsed from the most recent meal to the onset of signs and symptoms  
• Duration, intensity, and type of any exercise  within the 24 h prior to the signs and 
symptoms  
• Type of treatment used (e.g., juice, crackers) for the signs and symptoms and whether 
assistance was required from another person to administer the treatment  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, LLC

Conf idential  Page 50 of 78 
 • SMBG reading 15 minutes after treatment with carb ohydrate and the time at which this 
was measured  
• Whether or not the signs and symptoms attributed to hypoglycemia resolved after blood 
glucose returned to normal  
 
Subjects are encouraged to call the study clinic should signs and symptoms potentially 
relate d to hypoglycemia occur.  
At each study visit, the investigator should query the subject with regard to the occurrence of 
signs and symptoms potentially related to hypoglycemia.  
In the event of a blood glucose value < 70 mg/dL or signs and symptoms potenti ally related 
to hypoglycemia, the investigator should complete the supplemental CRF w.  
Hypoglycemia events will be recorded in the hypoglycemia log under 5 categories:  
1. Severe hypoglycemia: an event requiring assistance by [CONTACT_397928], glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_272210]. Plasma glucose 
measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery 
attrib utable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. All such 
events should be recorded as SAEs in the CRF  
2. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event du ring which typi[INVESTIGATOR_272211] a measured plasma glucose concentration <  70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L ) 
3. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: an event not accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_78237] a measured blood glucose concent ration  < 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L ) 
4. Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia 
are not accompanied by a blood glucose determination but that is presumably caused by a 
blood glucose concentration < 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L ) 
5. Relative hypoglycemia: An event during which the person with diabetes reports any of 
the typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and interprets those as indicative of 
hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≥ 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L).  
 
While eac h event meeting the criteria above will be entered into the hypoglycemia log, only 
severe  hypoglycemia, documented symptomatic hypoglycemia, and asymptomatic 
hypoglycemia, will be entered as AEs.  
The investigator should be alerted to the likelihood of imp roper glucose measurement 
technique if a study subject reports an SMBG value < 55 mg/dL that is not associated with 
any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia and is not treated by [CONTACT_397929].  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, LLC  
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_500850] to obtain glucose values, when possible, in the context of signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, even if the glucose value is measured after treatment for the symptoms is 
administered.  
If hypoglycemia oc curs, the total daily dose of the hypoglycemic  medication should be 
reduced 50% or more at the discretion of the investigator.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)  
DKA is a serious, acute complication of diabetes and can be life -threatening. Subjects with 
diabetes  will be educated on the signs and symptoms of DKA and will be required to call the 
study clinic and seek treatment should such signs and symptoms occur.  
During the clinical trial period, potential DKA in diabetic subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_397930]. Clinical presentations, such as difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting, lethargy, a fruity smell in the breath, or laboratory values tha t suggest clinically -
significant acidosis should be documented. Treatment of DKA should be provided when 
appropriate.  
If ongoing symptoms or signs suggest a possible DKA, the investigator should perform 
relevant laboratory testing while directing appropri ate medical care for the subject. If DKA is 
suspected, regardless of the blood glucose level, the following assessments should be done 
immediately: physical exam and serum glucose, bicarbonate, electrolytes, and serum ketones. 
Laboratory values should be m easured STAT at a local laboratory. If ketoacidosis is likely, 
investigational product administration should be discontinued and immediate appropriate 
medical therapy, including insulin, should be initiated. A glucose infusion may be provided if 
necessary to avoid hypoglycemia during insulin therapy. Insulin treatment should continue 
until resolution of the ketoacidosis and stabilization of the subject’s clinical condition. 
Investigational product administration may be resumed following stabilization of the  
subject’s condition.   The investigator should collect the data necessary for the completion of 
the DKA CRF.  
If symptoms suggestive of DKA may have occurred but are not ongoing, investigator should 
review available data in order to complete the DKA CRF. The investigator may also perform 
laboratory assessment using local resources if necessary for clinical care.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Acute Kidney Injur y 
Evaluation and management of subjects with and at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) should 
be performed during the study period based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline in 2012 ( KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline 
for AKI, 2012 ).  The c lassification/ staging System for AKI is described in Appendix 5. 
If serum creatinine increases suggesting a possible stage 1 AKI, the investigator should 
confirm the increase in serum creatinine within one week  of learning the result and enter an

 AE into the CRF if the serum creatinine does not spontaneously returns to  < 0.3 mg/dL from 
baseline. The investigator should encourage the subjects to maintain hydration and pursue 
any additional clinically relevant investigations to elucidate the cause or potential 
consequences of the decline in renal function. Study drug admi nistration may be suspended if 
clinically indicated until the creatinine value returns to < 0.3 mg/dL from baseline. Serum 
creatinine should be monitored based on the investigator’s judgment until creatinine returns 
to baseline level, within 0.3 mg/dL diff erence.  
If serum creatinine increases or other signs suggesting a possible stage [ADDRESS_500852] should be monitored daily and nephrology consultation or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 24 h 
should be considered.  Study drug administration should be stoppe d until the creatinine value 
returns to < 0.3 mg/dL from baseline. If potentially life -threatening conditions ( i.e., uremia, 
pulmonary edema, arrhythmia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hyperkalemia , 
metabolic acidosis ) are present occurring in the  setting of a possible stage [ADDRESS_500853] be stopped and the medical monitor should be 
informed. The medical monitor will advise on whether the study drug can be restarted after 
the resolution of the potentially l ife-threatening condition. Local laboratory testing will be 
acceptable when immediate lab results are necessary for clinical assessment.  
If interrupted, study drug may be reinitiated when serum creatinine returns to within 
0.3 mg/dL of the randomization va lue or if renal function remains 0.5 mg/dL above the 
randomization value but an alternative cause of the worsened renal function has been 
identified.  Dosing of study drug will be permanently discontinued if the subject is to start 
dialysis or other renal r eplacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The renal function monitoring plan is summarized in Figure 3.

 6.12.9  Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE)  
Evaluation of MACE will be undertaken across the development program for bexagliflozin. 
All MACE reports should also be captured as SAEs and every effort will be made to ensure 
that events recorded as MACE are coded in a similar manner within the safety database. The 
SAE listing will also be reviewed per iodically by [CONTACT_272272]. All subjects will be 
followed by [CONTACT_272273] . 
The independent CEC will receive and adjudicate the following events.

medications in the CRF. Any medication given to treat hypertension and continued for more 
than [ADDRESS_500856] be documented on the CRF. This 
documentation should continue unt il the subjects complete the study.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug

the IRB/EC determines that, based on good medical judgment, immediate cessation is 
appropriate for subject safet y. If a decision is made to withdraw a subject from the study, no 
further investigational product should be administered.  Reasons for all withdrawals should 
be recorded on the CRF.  Examples of reasons for withdrawal include:   
1. A protocol violation has oc curred , 
2. A serious or intolerable AE has occurred , 
3. A clinically significant change in a laboratory parameter has occurred ,  
4. The sponsor terminates the study, or  
5. The patient requests to be withdrawn  from the study.  
 
Subjects who do not complete the study but  who have received investigational product 
should complete the exit visit procedures including a physical examination, vital signs, ECG 
and clinical laboratory tests according to  Section 7 . 
Subjects who withdraw  from the study will not be replaced.

 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL  METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
The following sections provide a summary of the planned analysis of the trial data but a 
complete statistical analysis plan will be developed with further details before any unblinding 
occu rs.   
 
In general, descriptive summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of 
subjects [N] , mean, median, standard deviation  [SD] , quartiles, and minimum and maximum.  
Descript ive statistics in  categorical variables will include num ber and percentage of subjects  
in each category.  Summary  statistics will be p resented by [CONTACT_6660] .  Statistical 
analysis will be c arried out using SAS version 9.2  or later.  
 
Unless otherwise specified, all tests will be two -sided  at a 0.05 level o f significance.  All 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be two -sided 95% confidence intervals.   
9.2 Determination of Sample  Size 
The primary endpoint of study  603A  is the change from baseline (Day 1)  to week 12 in the 
24-hour average SBP of the bexagliflozin group compared to the placebo group using a 
superiority testing at an overall two -sided 0.05 level of significance.   
The primary endpoint of study  603B  is the change from  week 1 2 (cumulative  week 24) to 
week  24 (cumulative week 36) in the  24-hour average SBP in the bexagliflozin group 
compared to the placebo group using a superiority testing at an overall two -sided 0.05 level 
of significance.  
The assumptions to estimate the sample size for the primary endpoint of study 603A are: 
1. The magnitude of the decrease from baseline (Day 1)  to week 12 of the 24 h mean SBP in 
the b exagliflozin treatment arm will exceed that found in the placebo arm by 5 mm  Hg; 
2. The standard deviation of the change from baseline to week 12 will be  15 mm Hg  for 
both the active and placebo groups;  
3. The two -sided significance level is 0.05 . 
 
The assumptions to estimate the sample size required for the primary endpoint of study  603B 
are: 
1. Bexagliflozin will remain effective for at least 24 weeks.  The 24-hour average ABPM 
SBP will not change between week 12 and week 24 (cumulative week 2 4 and week 36) . 
2. Subjects who are randomized to receive placebo will show an increase in the ABPM SBP  
of 4 mm Hg between week 12 and week 24 (cumulative week 2 4 and week 36) . 
3. The standard deviation of the change  is 15 mm Hg for both the active and placebo 
groups.  
4. The two -sided significance level is 0.05.

significance for the second primary end point. It is estimated that 75% of subjects will have 
completed the [ADDRESS_500866] randomization. It is estimated that approximately 
8% will drop out for the first 12 weeks. With a sample size of 626 subjects at the end of 
study 603A , it will provide >95% power for the first primary endpoint.

value>0.512).  The overall power for the first primary endpoint maintains >95% with this 
interim look.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
The following populations will be used for analyses:  
9.3.1  Study 603A  
• Intent ion-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set : Include all subjec ts who are randomized to the 
study . All subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to wh ich they were 
randomized to receive . 
• Safety Analysis Set: Include all subjects who are randomized to the study and are treated.  
This data set will be used for both study 603A alone summaries and combined study 
603A and 603B summaries.  
  
9.3.2  Study 603B  
• Intent ion-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set:  Include a ll subjects who are randomized at week 
12 (cumulative week 24).  All subjects will be a nalyzed according to the treatment to 
which they were randomized to receive . 
• Safety Analysis Set: Include all subjects who are treated.  
• Safety Analysis Set for withdrawal period: Include all subjects who are randomized at 
week [ADDRESS_500868] one dose.  
 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

 9.5 Primary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary endpoint  of study 603A  is the change from baseline (Day 1) to week 12 of the 
24 h mean  SBP in the bexagliflozin group compared to the change in  the placebo group, 
testing for superiority at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance.   
The primary endpoint of study 603B  is the change from week  12 to week 24 (cumulative 
week 2 4 to week 36)  of the 24 h mean  SBP in the bexagliflozin group compared to the 
change in the placebo group , testing for superiority  at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance.   
For the primary efficacy assessment  in study 603A , an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
will be applied to analyze the mean change from baseline to week [ADDRESS_500870] square s mean s with 95% confidence interval s (CIs) 
will be generated for the difference between the treatment groups at week 12.  If a subject 
receives rescue medication or is withdrawn from the study early, the last post baseline 
observed value will be used for the primary analysis time point of week 12.  
For the primary efficacy assessment  in study  603B , a similar ANCOVA method will be 
applied , adjusted by [CONTACT_397932] 12 (cumulative week 24) . Changes 
from week [ADDRESS_500871] square s mean s with 95% CI s 
will be generated for the difference between the treatment groups at week 24. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be conducted as follows for missing data due to early 
withdrawal of  the study or receiving rescue medications.  
• Cumulative w eek [ADDRESS_500872] of evaluations prior to the rescue medication  
• Analyses will be based on subjects without rescue medication  
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] P oint analysis  will be conducted as follows:    
o Subjects in the b exagliflozin treatment arm who discontinue study participation or 
initiate rescue medication, will be analyzed assuming that their treatment effect  has 
worsen ed by G (where G = 0.5 to 5, with steps of 0.5) compared to the reduction of 
SBP for subjects who are in the study without rescue medication . 
o Subjects in the placebo treatment arm who discontinue study participation or initiate 
rescue medication, will be considered to hav e experienced a treatment effect the same 
as the reduction of SBP  for subjects who are in the study without rescue medication . 
 
9.6 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be accessed without multiplicity adjustment. Analyses will 
be pri marily based on ITT analysis sets.  
Absolute values and changes from baseline  (Day 1 for study 603A  or Week 12 value for 
study 603B ) in vital signs measurements, pulse pressure, body weight, peak -trough ratio  of 
ABPM SBP, and HbA1c will be summarized  descri ptively. Mean treatment effects will be 
estimated based on ANCOVA using similar method as  described  for the primary endpoint .

 The responder assessments, such as the proportion of subjects who achieve  specific goals,  
will be summarized by [CONTACT_397933]; logistic regression will be used to analyze the 
treatment effect with 95% CIs for the fraction responding within each treatment group and 
between treatment groups.  Analyses will be based  on all observed assessments prior to rescue 
medicati on or study end.  In addition, a sensitivity analysis by [CONTACT_397934] -responder for 
subjects who had no post baseline assessments prior to early withdrawal of the study or 
initiation of the rescue medication, will also be performed.  
In addition, changes in  mean ambulatory SBP /DBP  or office seated SBP/DBP after 12, 24, or 
36 weeks of b exagliflozin treatment  will also be summarized using  combined 603A and 
603B evaluations.  
Detailed analyses will be defined in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.7 Analysis of Safety  
Safety data include AEs, physical exam results, vital signs, ECG results, and clinical lab 
results includ ing serum chemistry, hematology parameters and urinalysis. Observed data will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_397935] (603A, 603B) or poole d studies using  
the safety analysis set s as defined in sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2 . 
9.7.1  Adverse Events  
AEs will be mapped to preferred term and body system using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. AEs that begin at or after the first 
administration of double -blind study medication  (i.e., first dose of study 603A)  or existing 
AEs that worsen in severity after the first dose of double -blind study medication are 
considered treatment emergent AEs (TEAE). Treatment emergent periods wi ll be divided 
into three periods: study 603A, study 603B prior to randomization, and study 603B after 
randomization . The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be summarized 
for each treatment group by [CONTACT_397936] d term , for each period 
as well as all periods combined . Further summaries by [CONTACT_397937]. Drug -related AE will be considered those to be at least 
possibly related to the study treatments based on t he investigators assessment.  
Similarly, t he number and percentage of subjects reporting serious AEs, and the number and 
percentage of subjects reporting AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will also be 
summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_397938].  
In addition, adverse events of special interest include, but not limited to UTI, GMI, 
hypoglycemia, hepatotoxicity, MACE, and DKA events, will be separately summarized.  
9.7.2  Laboratory Evaluations  and Other Safety Assessments  
Clinical laboratory tests (see Section [ADDRESS_500874]), vital signs, and 12 -lead ECG 
assessments will be descriptively summarized for actual values and changes from baseline  
(Day 1 for study 6 03A, and week 12 for study 603B) , by [CONTACT_397939].

 Laboratory data will be classified as low, normal or high relative to the parameter’s reference 
range. Laboratory abnormalities for each treatment will also be summarized by [CONTACT_397940].  
In addition, summaries based on assessments from both studies (603A and 603B) will also be 
presented.  T he changes  from the last assessment prior to first dose of bexagliflozin to after 
bexagliflozin treatment of [ADDRESS_500876] statistics (Z score) is less than 0.65 6 (or p -value>0.512).  The 
overall power for the first primary endpoint maintains >  95% with this interim look.  The 
interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_397912].

10.6 Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will m onitor overall safety information during the bexagliflozin 
development program. The safety review activity and potential risk benefit assessments 
utilized by [CONTACT_397946].  
10.7 Protocol Violations/Deviations  
Protocol violations include  deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria, concomitant 
medication restrictions, and any other protocol requirement that results in a significant added 
risk to the patient or has an impact on the quality of the data collected or the outcome of t he 
study. A deviation occurs when there is non -adherence to study procedures or schedules, as 
specified by [CONTACT_760], which does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria or the primary 
endpoint and which does not place the patient at any added risk or a ffect the data quality or 
study outcome. Examples of deviations may include common out -of-window visits, a missed 
procedure, etc. Protocol violations will reported in the final clinical study report, whereas 
protocol deviations may be mentioned but are not  required to be reported.  
It is important to conduct the study according to the protocol. Protocol deviation  waivers  will 
not be prospectively granted by [CONTACT_456]. If minor protocol deviations occur, the 
investigator must decide the most appropriate way  to proceed with study activities and 
should consult the study representative for assistance. If major protocol deviations occur, the 
sponsor’s Medical Monitor must be notified immediately so that a decision about whether to 
keep the subject in the study c an be made.  
Only when an emergency occurs that requires a departure from the protocol for an individual 
subject can there be a departure without the sponsor’s pre -approval. The nature and reasons 
for the protocol deviation/violations will be recorded in th e subject’s CRF, and the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_397904].  
Protocol deviations/violations must be reported in the final study report.

 Appendix 3  Hypertensive Emergency  
A hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure above either 180 mm Hg  SBP or 
120 mm Hg DBP (or an acute rise deemed significant by [CONTACT_15370]’s judgement) with

 Appendix 6  KDOQI Chronic Kidney Disease Classification and 
Acute Kidney Injury Stage Definition  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as either kidney damage or GFR < 60 
mL/min/1.73  m3 for ≥3 months.  Kidney damage is defined as pathologic abnormalities or 
markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies ( NFK 
KDOQ guidelines ). 
Stages of CKD are outlined in Table 2.  KDOQI CKD Stages Stage Description GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) 1 Kidney damage with normal or ↑↓GFR ≥ 90 2 Kidney damage with mild ↓GFR 60-89 3 Moderate ↓GFR 30-59 4 Severe ↓GFR 15-29 5 Kidney failure < 15 (or dialysis)  
Acute kidney injury stages based on the Definition by [CONTACT_378888] 
(AKIN) are outlined in Table 3 ( KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for AKI, 2012 ). Table  3. Classification/Staging System for Acute Kidney Injury Stage Serum creatinine criteria Urine output criteria 1 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline or ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 Pmol/L) increase from baseline <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 to 12 h 2 2.0 to 2.9 times baseline < 0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥ 12 h 3 3.0 times baseline, or Increase in serum creatinine to ≥4.0 mg/dL (≥ 353.6 Pmol/L), or Initiation of renal replacement therapy, or In patients < 18 years, decrease in eGFR to < 35 mL/min per 1.73 m2 < 0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥ 24 h or anuria for ≥ 12 h

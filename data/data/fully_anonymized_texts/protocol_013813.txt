 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objective  
 
The primary study objective is to assess the potential benefit of regorafenib in the 
treatment of advanced previously -treated pancreatic cancer.  The primary endpoint is 
progression free survival (PFS) calculated for each subject  and the primary objective 
is to evaluate the 16-week progression free survival rate relative to a historical 
control.  
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary objectives include critical examination of Response Rate (RR), Disease 
Control Rate (DCR, defined as CR+PR+SD), Overall Survival (OS), and toxicity.  
 
1.3. Exploratory Objectives  
 
Tissue and blood samples will be collected for MUC1 antigen  analyse s and future 
exploratory biomarker analyses.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Study Disease and Treatment History  
 
Approximately 40,000 people will develop pancreatic cancer in the [LOCATION_002] this 
year, the great majority of whom will die of their disease.  Only 15 -25% of patients 
have surgically resectable disease at the time of diagnosis, and most of those that are 
resected will recur after surgery.  For these reasons, cancer of the pancreas is the 
fourth -leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
Progress in th e treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer has been very slow, and 
novel approaches remain desperately needed.  Between the 1950’s and the 1990’s, [ADDRESS_1194355] treatment.  However, even with leucovorin -modulated 5 -
FU, response rates were only 5 -10%, with median survivals of approximately 5 
months.  In 1997, a randomized trial comparing 5 -FU with the nucleoside analogue 
gemcitabine suggested a small but clinically and statistically significant benefit for 
the newer agent.1  Gemcitabine demonstrated an improvement in the primary 
endpoint “clinical benefit response,” defined as a composite measure of pain, 
performance status, and weight (24% for gemcitabine vs. 5% for 5 -FU), as well as 
improvements in median OS (5.65 months vs. 4.41 months), and 1 -year survival 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
2 
 (18% vs. 2%).  This study has solidified gemcitabine as a standard therapy for the 
initial treatmen t of advanced pancreatic cancer.  
 
Attempts to improve upon the rather modest benefit of single -agent gemcitabine have 
met with mixed success.  Phase III studies have combined gemcitabine with 5 -FU2, 
cisplat in3, irinotecan4, pemetrexed5, capecitabine6, oxaliplatin7, exatecan8, 
cetuximab9, and bevacizumab10 without a survival benefit over gemcitabine alone.  A 
randomized phase III study demonstrated a clinically small but statistically significant 
survival benefit with the addition of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13403] -factor receptor (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlo tinib to standard gemcitabine therapy (median OS=6.37 
months vs. 5.91 months, HR=0.82, 95% CI:   0.69 -0.99).11  More recen tly, the 
addition of nab -paclitaxel to gemcitabine demonstrated an improvement in survival 
compared to gemcitabine alone (median OS 8.5 months vs. 6.7 months, HR=0.72, 
95% CI: 0.617 -0.835, p=0.000015), which establishes this combination as an 
appropriate f irst-line standard treatment option in patients with advanced pancreatic 
cancer.12  
 
The only non -gemcitabine based regimen to improve outcomes is the multi -agent 
combination of FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and infusional 
fluorouracil).  A 342 patient randomized study demonstrated a clinically a nd 
statistically significant improvement in OS (overall survival) for FOLFIRINOX 
compared to single -agent gemcitabine (11.1 months vs. 6.8 months, HR 0.57, 95% 
CI: 0.45 -0.73, p<0.0001)13, which makes it an appropriate front -line choice for 
healthier patients who can tolerate this relatively toxic regimen.   
 
Unfortunately, the prognosis for patients who have had failure of previous 
gemcitabine -based therapy is dismal with a median expected survival of less than 2.[ADDRESS_1194356] for advanced pancre atic 
cancer.  Thus, we wish to examine regorafenib in this setting.  
 
2.2. Experience with  Regor afenib  
 
2.2.1.  Pre-clinical  
 
In vivo, regorafenib exhibited anti -angiogenic and anti -proliferative effects in  
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194357] xenografts as demonstrated by a reduction in 
microvessel area, reduced Ki -67 staining, and reduced pERK1/2 staining in 
tissue sections from tumor xenografts, and dose -dependent inhibition of 
growth in multiple xenograft models (breas t, colon, renal, NSCLC, melanoma, 
pancreatic, thyroid, ovarian).  Immunohistochemical ex -vivo studies with a 
phospho –specific monoclonal anti -ERK 1 / [ADDRESS_1194358] five days after treatment with regorafenib in 
2 of 3 tumor models examined (MDA -MB 231 and BxPC -3), but not in 
NSCLC (H460).  
 
In addition, all tested human tumor xenografts (MDA -MB-231, H460, BxPC -
3 and Colo -205) demonstrated a significant reduction in new blood vessels by 
[CONTACT_115127] t umor samples using a murine CD31 
antibody.  These data suggest that regorafenib can target the tumor cell 
MAPK pathway (tumor cell survival) and tumor vasculature in some but not 
all tumors.  
 
2.2.2.  Clinical  
 
Two phase III global randomized studies have evaluated  the efficacy of 
regorafenib. The CORRECT (Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
treated with regorafenib or placebo after failure of standard therapy)  trial is an 
international, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study 
that enr olled [ADDRESS_1194359] supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus 
BSC. Treatment cycles consisted of 160 mg of r egorafenib (or matching 
placebo) once daily for three weeks on / one week off plus BSC. The primary 
endpoint of this trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included 
progression -free survival, objective tumor response rate and disease control 
rate. The safety and tolerability of the two treatment groups were also 
compared.[ADDRESS_1194360] ratio for overall 
survival was 0.773 (95% confidence interval [CI] , 0.635 to 0.941; 1 -sided p = 
.0051). Patients treated with regorafenib had a median overall survival of 6.4 
months, compared with 5.0 months for placebo — a 29% increase in survival. 
In addition to improved overall survival, progression -free survival was 
superior; median progression -free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.88 to 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016

 2.17) for regorafenib and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.68 to 1.74) for placebo. The 
estimated hazard ratio for progression -free survival was 0.493 (95% CI, 0.418 
to 0.581; 1 -sided p< .0000 01). There was a  substantial difference in disease 
control rate in the regorafenib and placebo groups (44% vs. 15%; p<.000001).  
Regorafenib demonstrated  comparable efficacy benefits across patient 
subgroups analyzed including age, number of metastases, nu mber of lines of 
prior therapy, and K -Ras status.[ADDRESS_1194361] frequent grade  3+ adverse events in the regorafenib group were 
hand –foot skin reaction (17%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (8%), 
hyperbilirubinemia (8%), and hypertension (7%).[ADDRESS_1194362] study supported FDA approval in September 2012.  
 
The efficacy and safety of regorafenib was also examined in the Phase III 
GRID trial in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who had 
exhausted all other treatment options. The study involved 199 patients with 
metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that had become resistant to imatinib and 
sunitinib. Patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib (160 mg orally once 
daily on a 3 weeks on/1 week off cycle) o r placebo, plus best supportive 
care.16 
 
The results showed that treatment with regorafen ib led to a statistically 
significant 3.9 -month improvement in progression -free survival 
(PFS),  compared with placebo (4.8 months vs. 0.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 
= 0.27; p<.0001). Overall survival was statistically similar between groups as 
expected due to a trial design that allowed crossover to regorafenib for disease 
progression (85% for placebo and 31% regorafenib randomized patients).  The 
overall disease control rate combining partial responses with durable stable 
disease for at least 12 weeks was 5 3% with regorafenib compared with 9% in 
the control group.  The most common grade ≥3 adverse events associated with 
regorafenib were hand -foot skin reaction (56.1%), hypertension (48.5%), and 
diarrhea (40.9%).[ADDRESS_1194363] -spectrum antitumor activity in xenograft models, with responses

Regorafenib has demonstrated activity in pancreatic xenograft models, and one 
patie nt with pancreatic cancer had prolonged stable disease to treatment with 
regorafenib (>21 months) in the published phase I experience.[ADDRESS_1194367] chemotherapy treatments

 2.3.1.  TAB 004 Studies  
 
In a collaborative study with the Hepatobiliary and Pancreas Surgery Department  
at Carolinas Medical Center, a novel antibody (TAB 004) based enzyme  
immunoassay (EIA) has been shown to detect circulating MUC1 in a stage - 
dependent manner in patients with pancreatic cancer.23 Furthermore, circulating  
levels of MUC1 correlated with its tissue expression. This study presents a unique  
opportunity to use the TAB 004 EIA and evaluate it as an indicator of  
regorafenib treatment efficacy. Protocol type TAB 004 EIA kits (manufactured at  
a GMP certified facility) will be provided by [CONTACT_857309], Inc .

3.3. Registration  
 
Subjects will be registered and assigned a Study ID number. The Study ID number 
will begin with “LCI” and include a two digit number identifying the enrolling 
investigational site, followed by a two digit number sequentially assigned to the 
subject. (e.g. “LCI0101” will be the Study ID number assigned to the first subject at 
the coordinating center.)  A Protocol Registration Form will be completed for each 
subject.  
 
3.4. Subject Wit hdrawal  
 
Subjects must be  withdrawn from the trial  (treatment and procedures) for the 
following reasons:  
 
• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures.  A 
subject must be removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the request 
of his/her legally acceptable representative.  At any time during the trial and 
without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate further.  The 
subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
10 
 • Pregnancy.  Pregnancy will be reported as an SAE.  (Note: Subjects who have 
been withdrawn from treatment with study drug because of pregnancy should 
not undergo CT scans [with contrast]/MRI or bone scans while pregnant.)  
• If, in the Investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the trial would be harmful to 
the subject's well -being.  
• Subject is lost to follow -up after three consecutive months of attempted 
contact.  
• Death.  
 
Subjects  may be  withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• The subject is non -compliant with study drug, trial procedur es, or both; 
including the use of anti -cancer therapy not prescribed by [CONTACT_4690].  
• Severe allergic reaction to regorafenib (such as exfoliative erythroderma or 
Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction).  
• The development of a second cancer.  
• Developme nt of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the 
judgment of the Investigator , significantly affect assessments of clinical status 
and trial endpoints.  
• Deterioration of ECOG performance status to 4.  
• Use of illicit drugs or other substances th at may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684] , have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise 
skewing trial result.   
• Any other (non -disease related) reason, at the Investigator ’s discretion.  
 
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until 
discharge or transfer is medically acceptable.  
 
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the 
subject's medical records.  
 
Details for the premature termination of the study as a whole (or com ponents thereof 
[e.g. centers, treatment arms, dose steps]) are provided in Section  12.2.  
 
3.5. Screen Failures  
 
A subject who, for any reason (e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria  or 
withdraws consent ), terminates the study before receiving first dos e of study drug is 
regarded a “screen failure”.   
 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
11 
  
 
All screen failures will be tracked in the CTMS (clinical trial management system).  
 
3.6. Replacement  
 
Subjects who withdraw consent after receiving first dose of study drug will not be 
replaced.  Screen failures may be replaced.  
 
4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN AND STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
4.1. Milestone Date Definitions  
 
Eligibility date : the date when the last procedure occurred that confirmed subject 
eligibility.  
Enrollment date : the date of initiation of regorafenib treatment.  
Treatment discontinuation date : the date the Investigator decides to discontinue the 
subject from regorafenib treatment.  
 
4.2. Overall Investigational Plan  
 
This is a single arm, single stage Phase II study designed to evaluate progression free  
survival in patients with locally -advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who have 
failed at least one prior line of therapy.  This study will initially open at  LCI.  
Additional investigational site(s) beyond the coordinating site will be added following  
activation. A total of [ADDRESS_1194384] stable disease will continue regorafenib therapy, at the  
Investigator ’s discretion, and will be radiologically restaged bimonthly.  The overall 
duration of the study is expected to be no longer than 24 months.   
 
Data from this study will be collected on electronic case report forms  (eCRFs).    
 
4.3. Study Procedures  
 
4.3.1.  Informed Consent  
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194385]  prior to 
undergoing protocol -specific evaluations or procedures and prior to  receiving 
treatment.   In addition, all subjects  will provide authorization for the release 
of their medical records for research purposes.  
 
4.3.2.  Demographics and Medical/Treatment History  
 
Demographics and medical/treatment history will be collected during the 
screening  visit. Medical and treatment history (oncological and relevant non -
oncological) will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  Cancer history will 
be obtained and the following  information (including but not limited to) will 
be reported in the eCRF:  
 
• Date of first histological/cytological diagnosis  
• Primary tumor site  
• Tumor histology and characteristics  
• Prior cancer therapy  
 
All medical history findings that occurred prior to the  patient signing 
infor med consent will be documented.  
 
4.3.3.  Pregnancy Test  
 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed at screening  and as clinically 
indicated for women of childbearing potential.  Women who are pregnant 
and/or breast -feeding are ineligible for study participation. Women will be 
counseled regarding risk of teratogenicity and need to use contraception 
through the course of the study.  Men will also be counseled on the need to 
use cont raception for all sexual encounters.  
 
4.3.4.  Office Visit  
 
Physical exam and documented evaluation by [CONTACT_6764], height ( screening  
only), and weight  will be documented during screening , repeated at Week 0 (if 
not within 7 days of study treatment)  and at each treatment visit.  Vital signs 
will be recorded and should include temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
blood pressure and oxygen saturation ( screening  and treatment).  ECOG 
performance status will be assessed during the screening  and treatment visits .  
Blood pressure will be monitored weekly for the first 6  weeks of treatment 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
13 
 and then every two weeks, or as  clinically indicated.  Office visits will occur 
according to the Study Calendar  in Section 5.  
 
4.3.5.  Adverse Event Assessment  
 
All adverse events and serious adverse events will be monitored and 
documented (regardless of grade or attribution) and reported to applicable 
agencies on an ongoing basis  beginning at screening .  Investigator s should 
refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for  regorafenib, 
including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected 
side effects of regorafenib.  As with any agent, there is always the potential 
for unexpected AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions.  The IB will be 
updated if any  new relevant safety data are obtained.  
 
4.3.6.  Concomitant Medications  
 
All medication that is considered necessary for the subject’s welfare, and 
which is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, 
may be given at the discretion of th e Investigator .  Specific caution should be 
taken when considering or administering a concomitant medication that is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_39705]2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9.  
Such concomitant medication should be avoided, if possible.  
 
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single 160 
mg dose of regorafenib  decreased the mean exposure of the drug , increased 
the mean exposure of the active metabolite M -5, and resulted in no change in 
the mean exposure of the active  metabolite M -2.  Avoid concomitant use of 
regorafenib  with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) . 
 
Co-administration of a strong  CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) with a single 
160mg dose of regorafenib  increased the mean exposure of regorafenib and 
decreased the mean exposure of the active metabolites M -2 and M -5.  Avoid  
concomitant use of regorafenib  with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity 
(e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole,  ketoconazole, nefazadone, 
posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole).  
Permitted concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430] : 
• Standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_39674].  
• Supportive care for any underlying illness.  
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
14 
 • Palliative radiation therapy is allowed if  the target lesion(s) are not 
included within the radiation field and no more than 10% of the bone 
marrow is irradiated.  
• Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) and other hematopoietic 
growth factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity, such as 
febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated or at the Investigator ’s 
discretion. However, they may not be subst ituted for a required dose 
reduction.  Subjects are permitted to take chronic erythropoietin.  
• Treatment with nonconventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as acupuncture), and 
vitamin/mineral supplements are permitted provided that they do not 
interfere with the study e ndpoints, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] . 
• Bisphosphonates . 
• Subjects who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or 
heparin will be allowed to participate provided that their medication dose 
and INR/PTT are stable.  Close monitoring ( within 7 days of the 
enrollment date  and as clinically indicated)  is mandatory.  If either of 
these values are above the therapeutic range, the doses should be 
modified and the assessments should be repeated weekly until they are 
stable.  
• Subjects taking na rrow therapeutic index medications should be 
monitored proactively (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin, quinidine, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Phenobarbital, cycl osporin, and digoxin).  Warfarin is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_857310]2C9 and its levels may be 
especially affe cted by [CONTACT_39707] . 
The following are not permitted:  
• Other investigational treatment during or within 30 days before starting 
study treatment . 
• Systemic antitumor therapy, including cytotoxic therapy, signal 
transduction inhibitors, immunotherapy, and horm onal therapy . 
• Bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue . 
• Use of St. Joh n’s wort (Hypericum perforatum).  Use of other herbal 
remedies is discouraged, and is permitted only with the specific assent of 
the Investigator.  All herbal and vitamin supplement use must be 
carefully documented.  
 
4.3.7.  Laboratory Tests  
 
The blood -based clinical laboratory tests  will include a complete blood count 
with differential and platelets, a basic metabolic panel (including  sodium, 
potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose,  and calcium .), and 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
15 
 liver function tests (A lbumin , Alkaline phosphatase , ALT  (SGPT) , AST  
(SGOT) , Direct Bilirubin , Total Bilirubin , and Total Protein ) which will be 
performed at screening and then again prior to the first dose of regora fenib if 
the enrollment date  is not within 7 days of eligibility confirmation. After  
enrollment , a complete blood count with differential and platelets and a 
comprehensive metabolic panel (including sodium, potassium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine , glucose, calcium,  albumin, alkaline phosphatase , 
ALT  (SGPT) , AST  (SGOT), total bilirubin , and total protein) will be 
performed  every 2 weeks  according to the Study Calendar .  LDH and CA  19-9 
will be collected at Week 0 and then every 4 weeks according to  the Study 
Calendar .  Amylase, lipase, coagulation panel  (INR, PT, PTT) , and pregnancy 
test (in appropriate subject s) will be collected at screening .   
 
4.3.8.  Radiology and Tumor Measurements  
 
A CT (computed tomography) scan with oral and intravenous contrast of  the 
chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed within [ADDRESS_1194386] 
dose of regorafenib ( screening  scan).  After enrollment,  scans will then be 
performed every eight  weeks  (+/- 2 weeks).  A contrast -enhanced MRI of th e 
abdomen and pelvis and an uncontrasted CT scan of the chest may be 
substituted if clinically necessary; however, subsequent studies must be 
performed using the same imaging modality throughout the study period. 
Scans will be submitted fo r Central Radiolo gy review per S ection 10.1.4.  
 
Every effort will be made to obtain imaging studies and tumor assessments 
every 8 weeks (+/ - 2 weeks) until documented progression for subject s who 
had a complete response, partial response, or stable disease, and/or 
disconti nued study therapy due to toxicity or reasons other than progressive 
disease.   
 
4.3.9.  Archived Tissue and Blood -based Biomarkers  
 
Tissue and serum will be collected and made available for analy sis for 
exploratory biomarker correlates by [CONTACT_553504].  For subject s who h ave archived 
tissue, the subject  agrees to tissue collection  being included in this study  by 
[CONTACT_1725] . Tissue will be requested after 
confirmation of study eligibility .  Subject s may be asked to undergo an 
optional core biopsy  after providing additional written informed consent .  
Subject s will not be excluded from this study if they choose not to undergo the 
optional core biopsy.  Core biopsy samples will be collected per standard

[IP_ADDRESS].  Initial Regorafenib Dosage and Administration (Cycle 1)  
 
Regorafenib will be started within 7 days of the eligibility date .  
Regorafenib is administered orally as monotherapy at 1 20 mg daily  
for 21 days  on /[ADDRESS_1194393] s will take three 40-mg 
regorafenib oral tablets (total dose 120 mg) each morning with a 
low-fat breakfast and approximately 8 fluid ounces (240mL) of 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194394] s will not take regorafenib  the following 7 days .  One cycle 
is 28 days.   Cycle start may be delayed up to 5 days.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Regorafenib Dose Escalation  (Cycle 2  and Subsequent Cycles ) 
 
After the first cycle of therapy on study  and at the start of cycle [ADDRESS_1194395] no worse tha n grade 1 toxicity (CTCAE v4 ) will 
have a dose escalation up to 160 mg daily, taken for 21 days  
followed by 7 days  off.  Subjects  with clinically significant grade 2 
or higher toxicity  considered possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to regorafenib, OR , in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] , may 
adversely impact the safety of the subject  will not have a dose 
escalation  (exclud ing alopecia, non -refractory nausea/vomiting, 
non-refractory hype rsensitivity and nonclinical and asympt omatic 
laboratory abnormalities) .  Subjects who undergo dose escalation 
up to [ADDRESS_1194396]  protocol guidelines (see section 7.2).   
 
Dose escalation by 1 level (i.e. from dose level -1 to dose level 0 , 
or from dose level -2 to dose level -1) can be considered as above 
at the treating Investigator’s discretion at the beginning of each 
subsequent [ADDRESS_1194397] 
protocol guidelines, whether or not dose escalation had previo usly 
occurred . 
 
6.1.2.   Regorafenib Drug Supply

 7. TREATMENT -REL ATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
7.1. Adverse Events Related to Regorafenib  
 
Based on data studies with regorafenib and from current knowledge of the 
pharmacological properties of other small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this 
drug class, as soon as there is reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_857305] , the Investigator  should immediately notify the appropriate agencies as 
outlined in Section 9.  
 
 
7.2. Prevention and Management of Adverse Events  
 
7.2.1.  Dose Modifications for Adverse Events  
The starting dose of regorafenib is 120 mg once daily  (starting dose 
level -1) but with a planned dose escalation (to dose level 0) with cycle 
2 if less than grade 2 clinically significant toxicity  (per the 
Investigator) is experienced (see section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  Study medication will 
be administered on a 21 days on/7 days  off schedule (3 weeks out of every 
4). Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant hematologic 
and non -hematologic toxicities that are related to protocol therapy 
according to the guidelines shown in the Dose Delays/Dose Modifications 
table that follows .  Dose modifications will follow predefined dose levels. 
Dose adjustments for hematologic toxicity are based on the blood counts 
obtained in preparation for the day of treatment.  
 
The modifications of regorafenib will follow the following predefined dose levels:  
Dose level [ADDRESS_1194402] causally re lated to study treat ment s.  If 
treatment is held for more than 4 weeks due to toxicity or if dose 
reductions beyond dose level -2 are necessary, then treatment will be 
permanently discontinued.

 The table above outlines dose adjustments for hematologic and non -
hematologic toxicities related to regorafenib except HFSR and 
hypertension.   In addition to these recommended dose modifications, 
subjects who develop diarrhea , mucositis , anorexia or other events 
predisposing to fluid loss or inadequate fluid intake should be carefully 
monitore d and rehydrated as clinically necessary.  This is in order to 
minimize the risk of postural hypotension and renal failure.

 • Check condition of hands and feet.  
• Suggest a manicure/pedicure, when indicated.  
• Recommend pumi ce stone use for callus or ‘rough spot’ removal.  
 
During regorafenib treatment:  
• Avoid pressure points.  
• Avoid items that rub, pi[INVESTIGATOR_39670].  
 
Use of creams  
• Non-urea based creams may be applied liberally.  
• Keratolytic creams (e.g. urea -based creams, salicylic acid 6%) may be 
used sparingly and only to affected (hyperkeratotic) areas.  
• Alpha hydroxyl acids (AHA) based creams may be applied liberally 2 
times a day.  Approximately 5% to 8% provides gentle chemical 
exfoliation.  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_39671] ( e.g. lidocaine 2%) are to be considered for pain 
control.  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_39672] 0.05% should be considered for 
subjects with Grade 2 or 3 HFSR.  Avoid systemic steroids.  
Tender areas should be protected as follows:  
• Use socks/gloves to cov er moisturizing creams  
• Wear well -padded footwear  
• Use insole cushions or inserts (e.g. silicon, gel)  
• Foot soaks with tepid water and Epson salts  
 
7.2.4.  Grading and Dose Adjustments for Hypertension  
Hypertension is a known AE associated with regorafenib treatment.  Subject will have their 
blood pressure measured at least weekly at the study site during the first 6 weeks of treatment.  If 
additional blood pressure measurements are done outside the stud y site, and the blood pressure is 
> 140 mm Hg systolic or > 90 mm Hg diastolic (NCI CTCAE v4.0), then the subject must 
contact [CONTACT_3462].  The management of hypertension, including the choice of 
antihypertensive medication, will be performed accordin g to local standards and to the usual 
practice of the Investigator .  Every effort should be made to control blood pressure by [CONTACT_857312].  If necessary, Table 7. 4 outlines suggested dose 
reductions.

7.2.6.  Prevention and Management of Diarrhea  
 
Diarrhea can be a common side effect of regorafenib.  The 
preventi ve/management strategies for diarrhea should be consistent with 
local standards (e.g., anti -diarrheals and optimized hydration status) and 
at the Investigator ’s discretion.  
 
Anti-diarrhea medications may be introduced if symptoms occur.  
Previous trials ha ve shown that the diarrhea could be managed with 
loperamide.  The recommended dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_1194415] onset, 
followed by 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea -free for 12 hours.

CTCAEv4 Grade 1 : mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention is not indicated.  
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 2 : moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is 
indicated; limiting to age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; 
instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing mon ey, etc.). 
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 3 : severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39676]; disabling; 
limiting to self -care ADL (self -care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressi ng, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 4 : life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.  
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 5 : death due to an AE  
7.4. Adverse Event Attribution  
 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question. AEs are considered to be “not 
related” or “related” to the study drug according to the following definitions:  
 
Not Related :  Evidence exists that the AE has a n etiology other than the study drug 
(eg, pre -existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  This includes events that are considered remotely or unlikely related to 
study drug.  
 
Related :  A temporal relationship  exists between the event onset and administration 
of the study drug.  It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In the case of cessation or reduction of 
the dose, the event abates or r esolves and reappears upon rechallenge.  It should be 
emphasized that ineffective study drug treatment should not be considered as causally 
related in the context of AE reporting.  This includes events that are considered 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug.  
Final attribution should be stated as follows (choose only one):  
Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
33 
 Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
7.5. Adverse Event Action and Outcome  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented  using the 
categories listed below:  
• Drug withdrawn  
• Drug interrupted  
• Dose reduced  
• Dose not changed  
• Dose increased  
• Not applicable  
• Unknown  
 
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
 
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Not recovered/not resolved  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
 
8. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
8.1. Safety Monitoring  
 
This trial will be monitored according to the processes in effect for all Levine Cancer 
Institute Investigator - Initiated Trials and will abide by [CONTACT_857313].  It is the 
responsibility of the Spon sor-Investigator  to monitor the safety data for this study.  
On at least a monthly basis, the Sponsor -Investigator , Study Statistician and Protocol 
Coordinator  will meet to monitor subject  consents, enrollment and retention, safety 
data for all subject s [including adverse events (AE’s) for all grades and attributions, 
serious adverse events (SAE’s)], study drug administration, and validity/integrity of 
the data.  SAEs will be reported to the IRB per their requirements.  Major protocol 
deviations that result  in a threat to subject safety or the integrity of the study will be 
reported to the IRB per their requirements. Following each meeting, a status will be

Carolinas Medical Center Office of Clinical and Translational Research, the FDA, 
and other appl icable regulations and guidelines (e.g. GCP).  
 
Data will be collected on electronic CRFs  in the CTMS .  
 
Subject s will be monitored by [CONTACT_857314]. This monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_857315]. Any variation between the two data sets will be discussed with the Protocol  
Coordinator  or Sponsor -Investigator . 
 
The study database will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and 
values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. 
Data queries requiring clarification will be generated and addre ssed by [CONTACT_857316]/or Sponsor - Investigator . Only authorized 
personnel will make corrections to the study  database and all corrections will be 
documented in an electronic audit trail.  
 
8.3. Communication Between Investigational Sites  
Investigational sites will be required to report AEs for all grades and attributions, 
SAEs, study drug administration, or any other problem that could affect the 
validity/integrity of the study data to the Sponsor -Investigator .  All investigational 
sites w ill report AEs using the eCRFs and SAEs  using the SAE reporting function in 
the CTMS  to the Sponsor -Investigator . AEs will be reported promptly of the 
Investigator  learning of the event.  SAEs will be reported within 24 hours , or next 
business day, of the Investigator learning of the event. Study drug administration or 
any other problem should be communicated to the Protocol  Coordinator and/or 
Sponsor -Investigator  by [CONTACT_857317] 2 business 
days of the Investigator  learning of the event.  
 
 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194418] one dose of study treatment will be valid for the safety 
analysis. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study treatment will be recorded an d 
included in the final report.  
 
Safety variables include the following: AEs and SAEs (whether related to regorafenib or 
not), laboratory changes (complete blood counts, electrolytes, chemistry, and coagulation), 
changes in vital signs (blood pressure, hea rt rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) and, in 
some instances, changes in radiologic  images . These assessments should be performed 
according to the Study Calendar.  Adverse events will be evaluated continuously 
through out the study. Safety and tolera bility, relationship to treatment and intensity will be 
assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0. All adverse events (Grades 1 – 5) will be determined by [CONTACT_857318].  
 
9.1. Unanticipated Problem Definition  
 
An UAP is any incidence, experience or outcome that is unexpected, given the 
information provided in research -related documentation ( e.g. Investigator ’s brochure, 
informed consent) and the study population characteristics that is related or possibly 
related to participation in the research study and places the participant at an increased 
risk.   
 
9.2. Adverse Event (AE) Definition  
 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, w hether or not considered drug related, including the following: An 
adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug in professional practice; an 
adverse event occurring from drug overdose whether accidental or intentional; an 
adverse event occurr ing from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected 
pharmacological action.  Pre-existing conditions that increase in frequency or severity 
or change in nature during or as a consequence of use of a drug in human clinical 
trials are also considered advers e events.  Adverse events may also include pre or 
post-treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol mandated procedures 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies).  
 
Any continuing medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnor mality 
with an onset date before the first date of study drug administration should be 
considered pre -existing and should be documented.  
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
36 
  
An AE does not include:  
• relapse or progression of the underlying malignant disease; however, the 
associated signs, sym ptoms, or diagnoses should be recorded as adverse events 
(e.g., “jaundice” due to new or increasing liver metastases, or “tumor pain” or 
“bone pain” due to progressive disease);  
• medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
 transfusion).  The condition that leads to the procedure is the adverse event;  
• situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and/or convenience admissions);  
• overdose of either study dru g or concomitant medication without any signs or 
 symptoms unless the subject  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913]; and  
• pregnancy  (Pregnancy during treatment should be reported as an SAE and on the  
      eCRF ) 
 
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as adverse events; however, signs 
and/or symptoms that are associated with laboratory findings requiring study 
withdrawal, dose modification, or medical intervention (e.g., anemia requiring 
transfusions or hyperglycemia requiring treatment) or other abnormal assessments 
(e.g., ECG, radiographs, vital signs) must be recorded as adverse events if they meet 
the definition of an adverse event .  In addition, laboratory abnormalities marked as 
clinically signific ant by [CONTACT_857319].  The Investigator  will record the most severe grade of the clinically 
significant laboratory abnormality and will evaluate its relationship to the study drug 
and clinical condition if/when a clinically significant  laboratory abnormality occurs.   
 
The relationship to study  drug therapy should be assessed using the following 
definitions:  
 
Not Related :  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug 
(eg, pre -existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  This includes events that are considered unrelated  or unlikely related to 
study drug.  
 
Related :  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and administration 
of the study drug.  It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
interc urrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In the case of cessation or reduction of 
the dose, the event abates or resolves and reappears upon rechallenge.  It should be 
emphasized that ineffective study drug treatment should not be considered as causally 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
37 
 related in the context of AE reporting.  This includes events that are considered 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug.  
 
All adverse events (including event name, grade, start/stop date and attribution) will 
be documented in the medical r ecord and on the case report form for this protocol .  
AEs wil l be captured from the time of enrollment through [ADDRESS_1194419] study d rug administration .  
 
The Investigator  is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for 
all adverse events and assigning the attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled 
on the trial.  
 
9.3 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Definition  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose 
should be considered adv erse drug reactions. The phrase “responses to a med icinal 
product” means in view of the investigator and/or company that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility 
and that the adverse event is associated with the use of the drug.  
 
9.4. “Serious Adverse Event (SAE)” Definition  
A Serious Adverse Event includes any event that:  
• Results in death.  
 
• Is life -threatening.  
NOTE: The term ‘life -threatening’ refers to an event during which the subject was 
at immediate risk of death from the adverse event.   It does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].

 NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition  is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. 
sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but d o not 
constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
 
• Is an important medical event.  
An event may be considered an important medical event when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definition.   Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
SAEs will be captured from the time of enrollment through [ADDRESS_1194420] lives elsewhere or has been released from his 
or her care and is being treated under another service at LCI.  
Laboratory abnormalities:  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will 
be recorded as such on the CRF and reported appropriately. The Investigator will 
record the most severe grade of the clinically significant laboratory abnormality 
and will evaluate its relationship to the study drug and clinical condition if/when a 
clinically significant laboratory abno rmality occurs.  
 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]:  
Elective surgeries that have been planned prior to subject enrollment in the study 
or for conditions existing prior to study enrollment do not need to be captured as

Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194421]’s 
baseline. They should however, be clearly documented on the case report form.  
Development of new cancers:  
Secondary malignancies are defined as new cancers, not transformations or 
progression of original disease.  
Secondary malignancies during 30 day time period:  
Any secondary malignancy diagnosed within [ADDRESS_1194422] be reported as an SAE.  
Secondary malignancies after the 30 day time period:  
Any secondary malignancy diagnosed greater than [ADDRESS_1194423] be 
reported as an SAE  
Deaths:  
Deaths during 30 day time period:  
Any death, expected or unexpected, occurring within [ADDRESS_1194424] be reported as an SAE.  
Deaths after the 30 day time period:  
Deaths occurring greater than [ADDRESS_1194425] be reported within 24 
hours  of knowledge of the event.  
 
All SAEs (including event name, grade, start/stop date and attribution) will be 
documented in the medical record and on the case report form for this protocol.  
The Investigator is responsible for verifyi ng and providing source documentation 
for all SAEs and assigning the attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled 
on the trial.  
 
9.5. Serious  Adverse Drug  Reaction (SADR) Definition  
 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
40 
 A Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is an event that meets any of the criteria for 
seriousness as previously defined and has a possible causal relationship to the study 
drug.  
 
The Sponsor -Investigator  is responsible for judging whether it is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the  serious  adverse event.  
 
9.6. “Unexpected” Definition  
An SAE or SA DR is to be considered unexpected if the event is not listed in the 
current Investigator  Brochure  or is not listed in the severity or specificity observed.   
Investigator s should refer to the Safety Information section of  the current IB for 
regorafenib , including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the 
expected side effects of, regorafenib.  As with any agent, there is always the potential 
for unexpected AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions.  The IB wi ll be updated if 
any new re levant safety data are obtained.  
9.7. SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
All Serious Adverse Events must be reported to the Sponsor -Investigator within 
[ADDRESS_1194426] be 
reported to Bayer within 24 hours , or next business day,  of the Principal 
Investigator’s awareness and must include the following m inimum information:  
1.  The name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_115177]  
2.  The name [CONTACT_115210](s)  
3.  A description of the reported SAE  
4.  A patient identified by [CONTACT_10980]:  
a.  Patient initials  
b.  Patient number  
c.  Knowle dge that a patient who experienced the adverse event exists  
d.  Age 
e.  Sex 
5.  An investigator assessment of study drug causality.    
 
Additional data which would aid the review and causality assessment of the case 
include but are not limited to:    
• The date of onset  
• The severity  
• The time from administration of study drug(s) to start of the event  
• The duration and outcome of the event  
• Any possible etiology for the event  
• The final diagnosis or syndrome, if known  
• Action(s) taken, if any  
 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
41 
 Expedited Reporting of Other Safety Information:  
The Investigator/ Sponsor shall report to Bayer within 24 hours , or next business day, 
of the investigator’s awareness of other events such as:    
 
• An adverse event related to study specific procedures  
• Any new and important eve nt related to treatment with the study drug(s).  
• Any pregnancy during which a female patient was exposed to the study drug(s)  
• Any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient, where the male patient was

Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194430]  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1.[ADDRESS_1194431] had their disease re -evaluated (either clinically or radiologically) 
will be considered evaluable for objective response.  These subject s will hav e 
their response classified according to the definitions stated below.   
 
10.1.2.  Disease Parameters  
Target lesions : When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline 
all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two 
lesions per org an) representative of all involved organs should be identified as 
target lesions  and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all invol ved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . It may be 
the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes  merit 
special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which 
are defined as measurable and may b e identified as target lesions must meet 
the criterion of a short axis of   ≥ [ADDRESS_1194432] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the 
axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal  or coronal). 
The smaller of these measures is the short axis. All other pathological nodes 
(those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but <15  mm) should be considered non -target 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194433] a short axis <10  mm are considered non -pathological 
and should not be recorded or  followed. A sum of the diameters  (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph nodes are to 
be included in the sum, then as noted above, only th e short  axis is added into 
the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of 
the disease.  
Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) includin g 
pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions  and 
should also be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’ (more details to follow).  
10.1.3.  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a 
ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_1194434] the images be burned to a disc  and de -identified,  and 
mail to the following address:

 Phone: (704) [ADDRESS_1194436] 1.1 Criteria.  
 Complete Response : 
• Target lesion: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph   
 nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to   
 <10 mm. 
• Non-target lesion: Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes   
 must be non -pathological in size (<10  mm short axis).  
 
Partial Response : 
• Target lesion: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target,  
 taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Non-target lesion: Not applicable  
 
Stable Disease : 
• Target lesion: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a partial response,   
 nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference   
 the smallest  sum diameters while on study.  
• Non-target lesion: Not applicable.  
 
Progressive Disease : 
• Target lesion: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target   
 lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the   
 baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative   
 increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at  
 least 5  mm. ( Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).  
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
45 
 • Non-target lesion: Unequivocal progression  (as described in RECIST version   
 1.1) of existing non -target lesions. ( Note:  the appearance of one or more new   
 lesions is also considered progression).  
 
Non-Complete Response / Non -Progressive Disease : 
• Target lesion:  Not applicable  
• Non-target lesion: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s)  
 
 Summary of RECIST : 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
‘normal’ size (<10  mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate pro gression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. This means 
that subject s with CR may not have a total sum of the diameters of ‘zero’.  
Subject s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objecti ve evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic 
deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_397473] .  It is included as part of the criteria for determination of Progression 
Free Survival.   The objective response status of such subject s is to be determined by

46 
 For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; 
cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next 
scheduled assessment. If at the next scheduled  assessme nt, progression is 
confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was 
suspected.  
 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1. Sample Size  
A total of [ADDRESS_1194438] s are alive and progression free at 16 weeks, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected (based on an exact binomial test) and regorafenib therapy may be considered 
for further evaluation in this subject  population.  Assuming a one -sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_1194439] 90% power to reject the null 
hypothesis, assuming the true 16-week progression free survival rate is 0.35.   An 
increase in the [ADDRESS_1194440] be documented 
in the medical records. The binary variable described above will be calculated 
for the primary objective.  
 
11.2.2.  Prog ression Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from enrollment to the study to time of 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194441] 1.1 criteria.  
 
11.2.6.  Safety Endpoints  
 
Safety endpoints will include treatment administration (cycles delivered, 
cumu lative dose administration, and relative dose intensity), AEs, SAEs, 
deaths while on study therapy, and laboratory determinations.  
 
11.3. Analysis Populations  
 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, [ADDRESS_1194442] 16 weeks of follow up time after the 
treatment start date. Preliminary analysis of the secondary endpoints 
(including PFS and OS) will also be done at the time of the primary analysis. 
However, an updated PFS analysis will also occur once the PFS censoring rate 
for all enrolled patients reaches 20% or after all patients have at least 1 year of 
follow up time (which ever occurs first). Additionally, for the purposes of OS, 
patients will continue to be followed until the OS censoring for all e nrolled 
patients reaches 20% or after all patients have at least 3 years of follow up 
time (whichever occurs first), and the final analysis will be conducted after 
this milestone is reached.    
 
11.4.2.  Subject  Disposition  
 
An accounting of all consenting subject s will be provided at the end of the 
study . This will include a breakdown of subject s who consented, were treated, 
discontinued treatment, died, and were lost to follow -up or withdrew consent.  
 
11.4.3.  Baseline Subject  and Disease Characteristics  
 
A summary of subject demographics and disease -related characteristics will 
be completed and subject  medical history will be assessed.  
 
 
11.4.4.  Efficacy Analyses  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Analysis  
 
The frequency and proportion of subject s alive and progression free 
Protocol Number:  LCI -GI-PAN -REG -001 
Version 7: February  19, 2016  
  
49 
 after 1 6 weeks will be calculated, along with a 95% Clopper Pearson 
confidence interval. A one -sided exact binomial test of proportions, 
with α = 0.10, will be carried out, testing the null hypothesis that the 
16-week progression free survival probability is less than 15%. 
Based on the sample size calculations described in Section 11.1, if at 
least [ADDRESS_1194443] s are alive and progression free at 16 weeks, the null 
hypothesis can be rejected.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Analyses  
 
Overall and progression free survival will be analyzed u sing Kaplan 
Meier techniques.  Medians, 25th, and 75th percentiles will be 
estimated.  Selected landmarks for OS (1, 3, 6, and 9 month survival 
rates) and PFS (1, 3, and 6 month PFS rates) will from the Kaplan 
Meier curve. Tumor response and disease contro l rates will be 
estimated with proportions and associated 95% Clopper Pearson 
confidence intervals will be calculated.  
 
11.4.5.  Safety Analyses  
 
Incident rates for adverse events, SAEs, and deaths while on study therapy 
will be summarized. Laboratory data will be analyzed quantitatively using 
methods for longitudinal data.  
 
11.4.6.  Exploratory Analyses  
 
Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression will be used to assess 
the correlation between baseline characteristics and biomarker expression 
levels with clinica l outcomes.  
 
11.5. Interim Analyses  
 
No interim analyses are planned for this study.

 Study Title : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_243702] T hyroid Carcinoma with Radiofrequency Ablation  
 
Protocol version number and date :  1; 10/2/2019 
 
Research Question and Aims 
 
Hypothesis :  
RFA can control or eliminate small papi[INVESTIGATOR_243703]. 
 
Aims, purpose, or objectives :  
We aim to study the changes in prima ry tumor volume, development of lymph node involveme nt, development 
of distant metastasis and changes in  serum thyroid hormone le vels in patients with papi[INVESTIGATOR_243704]. We will also asse ss the stability of these changes (n eed for repeat therapy) and the 
safety of the RFA procedure.  General Background:   
US population has a high prevalence of  thyroid nodules, with 50% of individuals after the age of 50% having at 
least one such lesion if ultrasound stud ies are performed. About 5-8% of thes e lesions harbor a thyroid cancer of 
which 80% are differentiated pa pi[INVESTIGATOR_243703]. 
The incidence of diagnosed papi[INVESTIGATOR_243705] (PTC) has increase d over the recent decades and this 
diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_243706] y. In a minority of these patients when the tumor 
size is < 10-15 mm the necessity of intervention is less clea r. The majority of these ca ses are treated surgically, 
with a minority observed and few treated with intra-lesional  ethanol injection. 
 
Surgery implies removal of (at least) ha lf of the thyroid with risk of surg ical complications, a neck scar and a 
high likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_243707] (50-80%) with subsequent  lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. 
However for these patients RFA opens new horizons. It has the ability to destroy the cancerous lesion (ref 
review (1) and avoids the developmen t of hypothyroidism (none noted in our  series of RFA therapy for much 
larger benign thyroid nodule (2). Adding to that the bene fit of avoiding surgical comp lications and a scar on the 
neck is a powerful motivator for patients to seek this therapy.  Background on Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) 
During the past ten years, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been shown to be a promising and well-tolerated 
new approach to benign TNs by [CONTACT_243714] (3). Randomized trials in 
Italy and South Korea reported a 50% to  80% volume reduction in treated TN s, with sustained results 3 years 
after the intervention (3-6). In the [LOCATION_002], RFA is commonly used for percutan eous treatment of tumors 
in the lung, liver, kidney and bone (7).  Yet until recently this intervention has not been validated for treating 
Greater than Minimal Risk Protocol Template   
 
C:\Users\slj19\Downloads\RFA_-_PTC_propos al_Feb_26._2020_VM.doc  Page [ADDRESS_295625]. Our results indicate substantial 
volume reduction of TNs by [CONTACT_147823] 45% at [ADDRESS_295626] undergone 
RFA for PTC, with reported 100% effic acy of tumor volume reduction ratio (VRR) ≥ 50% (8-9). In a most 
recent report from Jeong et al, (9) RFA has produced exce llent local tumor control for papi[INVESTIGATOR_243708]- and 
microcarcinomas. In addition to  the advantages listed above, complicatio ns of RFA are rare with only two cases 
related to vocal cord effects reported in literature so far, possibly attribut ed to nerve injuries during the ablation 
process; none life-threatening complications are reported. 
 
Therefore we aim to assess the effectiveness of RF A on eliminating small papi[INVESTIGATOR_243709], its 
ability for preservation of normal thyroid function and the overal l safety of RFA procedure. 
 Rationale: 
RFA delivers a large yet focused amount of energy to an area of thyroid ti ssue that becomes “charred” and thus 
nonfunctional and nonviable. The residua l tissue is slowly resorbed by [CONTACT_3433] e surrounding normal tissue, which 
leads to the resulting shrinkage of the original thyroid nodule (2, 10). Therefore this effect would be very 
desirable for a cancerous lesion, if it can be achieved safel y. Our experience confirms  that ultrasound-guided 
RFA is a clinically effective and sa fe outpatient treatment in patients w ith symptomatic or steadily growing 
benign, large, predominantly solid TNs. With appropria te expertise and world class infrastructure at Mayo 
Clinic this technique can be extended to treat papi[INVESTIGATOR_243710] d carcinomas and has the pot ential to become an 
alternative for the management of ca ncerous papi[INVESTIGATOR_243711]. Hence this pi[INVESTIGATOR_243712],  reveal factors predicting greater 
response, comparing the performance of RFA with other procedures, and timing of the additional RFA sessions, 
if needed.

 Study Design and Procedure 
 
STUDY DESIGN This will be an open-label clinical trial that will target patients di agnosed with small papi[INVESTIGATOR_243713] (<1.5 cm) interested in RFA therapy. They will be assessed clinically and if they are considered 
candidates for non-surgical choices (observation or percutaneous ethanol inj ection) these patients will then be 
offered also the option of RFA thera py. We will treat them with RFA therapy of the PTC lesion and monitor the 
clinical response through changes in nodule size as measured by [CONTACT_243715] (> 50% volume shrinkage at 18 
months considered positive outcome) and/ or development of cervical or dist ant metastatic disease. We expect 
that an individual will be thus in th e study for a total of [ADDRESS_295627] that we would be able  to identify 15 cases/year that woul d qualify for this trial. Given the 
potential acceptance to enrollment we expect that it would take 18-24 months for the tr ial completion.

 PROCEDURE:  
Enrolled patients will undergo RFA in a single session and then be followed for efficacy and safety of the procedure for 18 months.   Ultrasonography will be performed using a 6- to 15-MH z probe with the GE Logiq E9 ultrasound system. 
Nodule volume and the percentage of volume reduction are calculated us ing the following e quations: volume= 
length x width x depth x 0.525; volume reduction percentage = [(initial volu me - final volume)  x 100%] /initial 
volume. 
 
Patients will be sedated with general an esthesia during the procedure. General anesthesia is preferred in light of 
the improved pain control, and the desire to avoid any motion interference that could compromise the accuracy 
of the technique. A radiofrequency generator (Cool-tip; Covidi en) and an 18-gauge, 15-cm electrode with a 1- 
or 2-cm active tip will be used in th e procedure. All radiofrequency proce dures will be performed by [CONTACT_243716].  For electrode placement, an in-plane oblique approach will be employed as opposed to directly entering the TN 
using the shortest pathway. The longer oblique pathway is  chosen to lengthen the di stance between the skin and 
the active tip of the RF electrode to reduce the chance of skin burns.  Steps will be taken to protect 
extrathyroidal structures from gene rated thermal energy including sel ection of needle path, continuous 
ultrasound monitoring, and potential hydro- dissection if needed to generate  a safe margin. Nodules will be 
selected for treatment that can be ex pected to be treated with technical success without the zone of ablation 
extending beyond the margin of the thyroid. Subcapsula r lesions may be treated if the thyroid can be 
confidently isolated from adjacent structures with hydro- dissection. Safety will be pa ramount. The active tip of 
the electrode will be kept at a safe  distance to prevent a skin burn.   
The size and number of RF electrodes, total energy delivered, and total ablation times will be different according to target size and location. Patients will be intensively monitored during RFA and then closely 
observed for approximately 3 hours afte r the procedure and released home thereafter, unless adverse effects 
developed (11, 12).  To evaluate safety and efficacy of RFA procedure, post discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], patients will be asked to fill-in 
a pain questionnaire to assess any level of pain or discomfort post RFA procedure and contact[CONTACT_243717] [ADDRESS_295628] a face-to-face visit 1 month after the procedure for 
safety assessment as well. During this visit patients w ill provide blood sample for labo ratory tests (Calcium and 
thyroid tests TSH, T3, T4, and Tg). Next face-to-face vi sit will happen at 3 month after the procedure; at this 
visit patients will provide a small volume of blood to test thyroid receptor antibody. Further in the process, 
patients will be monitored clinically fo r up to [ADDRESS_295629] RFA procedure. 
 Note: For laboratory research a smal l volume of blood (5 ml) will be draw n from patient prior to and post RFA 
in the OR. Blood will be processed for Mass Spectrometry analysis to eval uate if high temperature generated 
from RFA would impart any conforma tional changes to thyroid hormone s and impact biological functions.

Title:   A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_803120] :  TARGET ANH  
 
Rationale:  The results of this study will help enha nce current  understanding of the impact of 
Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution  (ANH ) administration on transfusion requirements post 
cardiac surgery,  the effect of this procedure on  coagulation , and platelet hemostasis , and the 
amount of chest tube drainag e [ADDRESS_1108578] coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] ( CABG ) 
surgery . 
 
Objectives:    
Primary :  
The primary objective  will be assessment of hemostasis  at baseline and serially during 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_803126].  
 
Study Type:   Single center study, p rospective, observational, open label .  
 
Study Design:   A total of  [ADDRESS_1108579]- time isolated  (CABG) utilizing cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] 
(CPB)  with the administration of ANH, and [ADDRESS_1108580] - time isolated CABG 
between the ages of 18 - 85 years old not receiving ANH .  
 
Study Methodology:  We will analyze the hemostatic markers of 60 patients  undergoing cardiac 
surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) pre and post ANH infusion , and witho ut ANH 
infusion  at various time points which shall be different for both the experimental (ANH recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) 
and the control group (non -ANH recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) culminating at [ADDRESS_1108581] tube drainage.  Time points for the control group (non -ANH recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840])  
will include seven blood draws (7): baseline, [ADDRESS_1108582] CPB 
withdraw.  
Time points for the experimental group (ANH recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) will include eight (8)  blood draws: 
baseline,  [ADDRESS_1108583] ANH reinfusion .  
Statistical Methodology:  Categorical variables will be expressed as n (%). Continuous variables 
will be reported as mean ± (SD)],  or median (interquartile  range ), where appropriate . Paired t -
tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests or will be performed to test differences in lab  values before 
and after treatment . Correlation analysis  will be  performed by [CONTACT_141612]’s or Spearman’s Rho, 
where appropriate . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models will be used to 
determ ine predictors of clinical endpoints  (24-hours chest output  and total number of transfused 
Page 3 of 18 packed blood cells ). The predictive cut -point values of pla telet function tests to clinical endpoints 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_803127] ( ROC ) curve analysis  with Area Under Curve 
(AUC) statistics . We will use separate repeated me asures generalized linear mixed model s to 
associate changes  in hemostatic markers, reduced chest -tube drainage, reduction in transfusion, 
etc. Statistical calculations will be carried out using SAS  (Ver. 9.3, Cary, NC).  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Specific Aims  
 To better understand the relationship between ANH utilization during CABG  and its 
effect on the quantity and charact er of specific biomarkers of thrombogenicity  at 
baseline  and serially pre- withdraw and post- reinfusion  of the patients collected  
blood .  
 To identify variations in thrombogenic phenot ypes which play a role in the 
decreased incidence of bleeding  complications among  patients undergoing ANH 
transfusion post CABG  and those patients who do not undergo ANH transfusion . 
And to o btain pi[INVESTIGATOR_803121] [ADDRESS_1108584] among procedures that consume allogenic blood transfusions. 
Excessive bleeding in cardiac surgery is multifactorial in that it can be caused by [CONTACT_803128] 1. And while allogenic blood transfusion 
has been identified as a major mechanism of harm in cardi ac surgery patients it is balanced by [CONTACT_803129] 2. Predictors for the need of  allogenic blood transfusion include; 
advanced age, preoperative anemia, small  body size, female sex, preoperative antithrombotic 
therapy, coagulation disor ders, reoperation, and prolonged CPB time 3. Preoperative hematocrit is  
the most frequent indicator of  intraoperative transfusion in CABG patients 4. The incidence of chest 
tube drainage greater than [ADDRESS_1108585] for allogenic blood transfusion in the context o f  CABG 
utilizing CPB  are; infection, circulatory overload secondary to blood volume increase, immune 
suppression, transfusion mediated acute lung injury, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61150], renal failure, 
stroke, febrile reactions, hemolytic reactions, severe sepsis, sternal wound infec tion, post - operative 
pneumonia, multiple organ failure, frequent admission to intensive care, increased length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210] , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], and most significantly  an increased short and long term mortality  
Page 4 of 18 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,24. Patients undergoing CABG are also at risk for anemia related to periopera tive bleeding, 
coagulopathy,  hemodilution secondary to pump priming solutions 11, 12, 13 and pump trauma .  
The use of allogenic transfusion to increase tissue oxygenation in perioperative anemic patients  
while theoretically effective is disputed by [CONTACT_803130] 14, 15. Hemodi lution is a strategy that may 
avoid  or limit  the utilization of allogenic blood 16. 
Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH) involves the removal of the patients own blood 
immediately at the induction of an esthesia and replacement of that  blood with an equivalent 
volume of crystalloid or colloid solution in order to dissuade the loss of RBC  17 cell mass , the 
mechanism of action is dilution of the blood, hematocrit reduction, and reduction of the 
anticoagulant components of the blood 18 associated with bleeding during CABG utilizing CPB. 
The removed blood is isolated from the negative effects of CPB such as the activatio n and 
consumption of platelets 19, the retention of RBC’s in the pump mechanism, and the destruction 
of blood products secondary to pump trauma.  The collected  blood is then stored in anticoagulant 
treated blood bags and reinfused into the patient in reverse harvest order [ADDRESS_1108586] 16, 17. 
A review of relevant literature identifies many situations in which ANH is beneficial; in patients 
that refuse blood transfusion for religious reasons ANH provides RBC’s, plasma, and platelets, 
in patients who have a preoperative high hematocrit  count  [ADDRESS_1108587] effects of coagulation, hemolysis, fibrinolysis, or negative  
immune  response in the collected  blood as opposed to RBC transfusion 21.  
However, the beneficial attributes of ANH are countered by [CONTACT_803131]; the time 
consuming nature of harvesting and reinfusing the  patient’s blood, an initial low hemoglobin 
count limits the amount of blood that can be collected , and the role  of intraoperative blood 
conservation  has been touted to also reduce the need for allogenic transfusion without the 
disadvantages of ANH [ADDRESS_1108588] in patients undergoing ANH  on; the need f or allogenic blood 
transfusion, hemostatic  markers, and chest tube drain age [ADDRESS_1108589] CABG. Positive effects in 
reduced number of transfused RBC’s , the hemostatic markers of anticoagulation and platelets, 
and reduced chest tube drainage at [ADDRESS_1108590] use (OR= 0.41, p<0.001), including use of 
RBC (OR= 0.32, p<0.001) and fresh frozen plasma (OR=0.49, p<0.001). Transfusion of 
intraoperative RBC and FFP was independently associated with greater risk for prolonged 
mechanical ventilation (p<0. 001 and p=0.003, respectively) and operative mortality (p=0.005 
and p=0.04). However, how ANH influences hemostasis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery 
is unknown  27.

               incapacity will be not be enrolled in this study.  
 
2.6 Recruitment   
Recruitment will occur in one of two settings; while  inpatient at the IHVI upon first contact [CONTACT_803132], while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_803122], or  outpatient at the Inova Cardiac Surgery offices 
at [ADDRESS_1108593] (e.g. recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data quality; protocol compliance) does 
not suggest a proper completion of the trial within the reasonable time frame as agreed upon, the 
recruitment period may be extended to reach the desired sample size.  
 
2.7 Inclusion Criteria  
 Subject is 18 to 85 years old . 
 Subject undergoing a n isolated  CABG procedure  with or without ANH  
 Subject  is hemodynamically stable  
 The subject is able to read and has signed and dated the informed consent document    
including authorization permitting release of personal health information approved     
by [CONTACT_093]'s Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
  
2.8 Exclusion  Criteria : Subjects will be excluded from entry if ANY of the criteria listed below 
are met:  
 Prior CABG  
 Hematocrit < 30 at baseline  (ANH Group only). Hematocrit will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_803133]   
 Insufficient (Low) o n pump hematocrit  of <21%  
 Patient is hemodynamically unstable  
 Subject requiring an emergency procedure  
 Left main coronary artery stenosis  with evidence of hemodynamic instability (e.g. 
 hypotension, ST segment elevations on electrocardiogram).  
 Aortic valve stenosis (e.g. hypotension, ST segment elevations on 
 electrocardiogram).   
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1108594]- surgery  A total of 60- 80  mLs of blood will be collected  for research 
purposes  throughout the study  duration  based on  group designation (ANH recipi[INVESTIGATOR_803123]) . See timing of assessments table for specific laboratory tests drawn at each time  point for 
each group .  
 
The screening pr ocess will consist of the routine  pre-operative  screening process  which is 
standard of care for cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_4897] : imaging, laboratory blood draws and a  
complete history and physical examination . Those patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria 
and do not meet any of the  exclusion criteria will be offered enrollment.  
 
Baseline shall be defined as the commencement of CABG  surgery upon the induction of 
anesthesia, but before utilization of the c oronary artery by[CONTACT_348693].  Baseline laboratory 
assessments which will entail collection of the markers of coagulation and platelet function at the 
commencement of surgery upon induction of anesthesia and the insertion of the central venous 
catheter. D uring  CPB  just after the induction of anesthesia , a central venous catheter  and other 
monitoring catheters are inserted  into the patient . The insertion s of these  monitoring catheters are 
standard of care during CABG  surgery. Prior to  the start of the blood removal phase of the ANH 
procedure , blood samples will be obtained for baseline complete blood count, coagulation, 
inflammation, and hemosta tic markers. A calculated  amount of blood  will then be  removed and 
sequestered at room tempe rature in the cardiovascular operating room  (CVOR) to protect it from 
the damaging effects of both the CPB machine and the procedure.  
 
Once the CPB machine has been initiated, the subjects on - pump hematocrit (HCT) will be 
calculated.  A safety threshold for blood removal in the ANH process will be calculated 
according to the following formula by [CONTACT_408652]:  
 
EBV= fbv x kg        Eq.[ADDRESS_1108595] pre -cpb= Hct on cpb x (EBV + Prime volume)   Eq.2 
    EBV  
 
ANH Volume= EBV x (Hct baseline – Hct pre -cpb)  Eq.[ADDRESS_1108596] baseline  
 
 
 EBV= patient’s blood volume in milliliters.  
 Fbv= blood volume factor in cc blood per kilogram: usually 65 -70ml  
 Kg = patient’s weight in kilograms  
 Hct pre -cpb = percent estimated patient Hct required before CPB to achieve the  desired 
Hct on cpb  
Page 8 of 18  Hct on cpb = desired percent Hct after initiating CPB  
 Prime volume = extracorporeal circuit prime volume after retrograde autologous 
 priming (if applicable) . 
 Hct baseline = patient’s percent Hct after hemodilution after the induction of the 
 anesthetic agent  
 ANH volume = whole blood volume in cc to be sequestered prior to CPB  
 
This assessment will determine whether subjects undergo ANH or do not have sufficient 
hematocrit to undergo ANH. Once determination of adequate on - pump hematocrit has been 
confirmed blood samples from the subject  will be collected [ADDRESS_1108597] of care, others are trial-related (i.e. coagulation, 
inflammation, and hemostasis markers).  
 
The blood tests  that are done at [ADDRESS_1108598] reinfu sion are expected to be done in the 
CVOR  or in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU) depending on the patient’s 
location. These samples will be obtained through the central venous catheter.  The 16-24 hour 
blood draw will be done in the (CVICU) thr ough the central venous catheter  or phlebotomy  
depending on the time of discontinuation of the central line, and this will conclude blood 
sampling collection for the trial.  
 
Should the subject become hemodynamically unstable  (systolic BP less than 90 mmHg)  at any 
time within either the experimental or the control group  assessments will be stopped and 
standard of care will be continued as appropriate for the subject’s condition.  Patient will continue 
to be followed for [ADDRESS_1108599] con sent to the use of remaining specimens, plasma samples for possible future 
analysis will be stored at minus 70 - 80 degrees Celsius for up to 2 years.     
 
 
3.2 Endpoints/Outcomes Measurements  
 3.2.1 Primary Objective  
 The primary endpoint will be assessment  of hemostasis  at baseline and serially 
during CABG  surgery utilizing the CPB . 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1108600] will receive a copy of the signed consent form. 
Patients incapable of providing  consent due to a medical situation will not be approached for 
study participation. No study related procedures may commence without a signed consent 
form.  A separate signature [CONTACT_22862] a subjects agreement to allow any 
remaining specim ens obtained during the course of participation to be used for ancillary 
research. Subjects who decline to participate in this optional research will not provide this 
separate signature [CONTACT_803141].  
  
 
4. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS/DATA ANALYSIS  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1108601] on markers of coagulation and platelet activation in 
patients unde rgoing CABG surgery remains untested. As such a reasonable calculation of a          
sample size based on the accepted error rate is currently not feasible.  
      
4.2   Statistical Analysis  
Categorical variables will be expressed as n (%). Continuous variables will be reported as 
mean ±SD, or median (interquartile  range ), where appropriate . The paired t -test or Wilcoxon 
signed rank test or will be performed to test differences in lab values before and after treatment . 
Correlation coefficients will be pe rformed by [CONTACT_141612]’s or Spearman’s Rho, where appropriate . 
Predictive cut -point values of pla telet function tests to clinical endpoints will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_803134] (AUC) statistics and 95% confidence intervals 
presented . Although underpowered given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_774784], to address the hypothesis that ANH 
will be associated with changes  in hemostatic markers, reduced chest -tube drainage, reduction in 
transfusion, etc., we will use separate repeated me asures generalized linear mix ed model 
(GLMM) with a random intercept and the appropriate link function (e.g., binary , logit, etc. ). 
Statistical calculations will be carried out using SAS  (ver. 9.3, Cary, NC).  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1108602] of 1996 (HIPAA). 
Each subject screened and enrolled will be assigned a subject identification number ( SID) 
and a list of subject s with their corresponding SID will be maintained separately from 
collected data. Physical CRFs will be stored at the research site in a locked office and 
electronic subject data will be locked in a password protected file on a secure internet 
server, accessed only by [CONTACT_195762].   
 
4.3.2 Records Retention  
Page 10 of 18 The Investigator will maintain the records of final CRFs (CDROM copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), worksheets, 
source documents, and all other study -specific documentation in accordance with ICH 
Guidelines. Essential documents shoul d be retained for at least three  (3) years after the 
investigation is formally discontinued.  
 
 
5. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION (Risks, Benefits, and Alternatives)  
 
5.1 Risks  
 
5.1.1 Potential Loss of Privacy  
Protected health information (PHI) will be collected during the study. The risk for breach of 
confidentiality and privacy will be minimized by [CONTACT_195763].  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1108603] benefits to the patient. Participat ion in the study is entirely voluntary. The 
alternative is not to participate in the trial  but to still receive the ANH procedure as part of CABG 
surgery.

2. Précis/Abstract:  
The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether riluzole, a drug that increases glutamate reuptake, will decrease CNS glutamate in breast cancer survivors with increased 
inflammation and fatigue. We will also determine whether decreasing glutamate with riluzole will reverse inflammation -related fatigue and other symptoms including cognitive dysfunction and 
decreased motivation.  To accomplish these  goals, we plan to conduct  an 8 week,  double- blind, 
randomized control trial of riluzole (100 mg/d) versus placebo in [ADDRESS_510865] cancer survivors 
(n=20 per group).  All breast cancer survivors will have completed treatment within [ADDRESS_510866] a fatigue level of ≥4 (on a 10 point scale) and a plasma c-reactive protein (CRP) 
concentration >3mg/L (indicative of high inflammation ).  Patients will undergo magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to mea sure CNS glutamate before and after 1 and 8 weeks of 
riluzole  or placebo treatment.  Fatigue and other behavioral assessments including measures of 
cognitive function, motivation , and startle reactivity  will be conducted  before and after treatment  
and correlated with the change in CNS glutamate .  
 
3. Introduction and Background:  
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women with ~250,[ADDRESS_510867] 
for a significant percentage of women with up to 30% of women experiencing behavioral and/or 
cognitive symptoms months to years after treatment completion. [1-4] The mechanisms which 
contri bute to these symptoms are only beginning to be understood, however, mounting data 
suggest that inflammation may be involved.  
 Work from our group and others have demonstrated significant relationships between inflammatory markers and inflammatory signaling pathways and symptoms of fatigue and 
cognitive dysfunction in patients with multiple forms of cancer including breast cancer  2,7-11.[2, 
5-8] In addition, polymorphisms in genes for inflammatory cytokines have been associated with 
cancer -related fatigue in breast cancer patients. [9, 10] Moreover , blockade of the inflammatory 
cytokine TNF -alpha was found to reduce symptoms of fatigue in patients with advanced cancer, 
suggesting a cause and effect relationship between inflammation and behavioral change. [11]  
 
There are a number of theories as to how inflammation may influence fatigue and cognition 
function in breast cancer patients. One neurotransmitter pathway that may be involved is 
glutamate. [12, 13] Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to decrease glutamate reuptake 
and increase glutamate release from ast rocytes. [14-16] Excess glutamate has been shown to 
Emory IRB# 00086271  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_405184]: Donor Funds  
Page 3 of 30 
IRB#: [ADDRESS_510868] excitotoxicity and inhibition of neuronal 
growth factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor.  [12, 17] In addition to direct effects of 
inflammatory cytokines on glutamate reuptake and release, inflammatory cytokines can also lead to the activation of the kynurenine pathway. [18, 19 ] The kynurenine pathway involves 
stimulation of the enzyme indoleamine dioxygenase which breaks down tryptophan into kynurenine.  [18, 19] Kynurenine is then transported i nto the brain through the large amino acid 
transporter where it is converted to quinolinic acid (QUIN) in microglia as well as activated 
macrophages which can enter the brain during an inflammatory state.  [12, 18-20] QUIN not only 
directly binds the glutamate [ N-Methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA)] receptor, but also inhibits glutamate 
reuptake.  [19, 21] Interestingly, in a recent study in rats, the NMDA antagonist ketamine was 
found to block the development of depressive- like behavior following administration of the 
inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide. [22] Surprisingly, ketamine (a drug that has also 
shown profound efficacy in patients with treatment resistant depression) [23] had no effect on the 
inflammatory response or activation of the kynurenine pathway in LPS -treated animals, 
indicating that the “end game” of inflammation and activation of the kynurenine pathway may 
indeed be glutamate. [22] 
 
Consistent with impact of inflammation on glutamate metabolism in laboratory animals, recent work by [CONTACT_405196], interferon (IFN) -
alpha, to patients with hepatitis C leads to increases in CNS glutamate in the basal ganglia and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as measured by [CONTACT_156539] 
(MRS).[ 24] The basal ganglia and dACC are well known targets of inflammatory cytokines on 
the brain, and cytokine effects on these brain regions have been associated with symptoms of 
fatigue and cognitive dysfunction as well as reduced motivation.[ 25] Increases in glutamate as 
measured by [CONTACT_405197] (including reduced motivation) and 
peripheral markers of inflammation including sTNFR2.[ 26] Interestingly, our most recent data 
indicate that in patients with major depressive disorder, there is a stepwise relationship between CRP and basal ganglia glutamate with patients with a CRP >3mg/L, which is considered high inflammation, exhibiting significantly higher basal ganglia glutamate than patients with a 
CRP<1mg/L. [27]  In addition, similar to what was found in IFN- alpha- treated patients, increased 
basal ganglia glutamate in depressed patients was correlated with decreased motivation and 
cognitive dysfunction as manifested by [CONTACT_405198]. [27] Relevant to the translational 
relevance of the potential relationships among infl ammation, glutamate and fatigue and 
cognitive symptoms, a recent study in cancer patients receiving whole brain radiation 
demonstrated that the glutamate antagonist memantine was able to attenuate the effects of 
radiation on cognitive function, indicating that blocking glutamate may treat symptoms in cancer 
patients with an increased inflammatory load. [28] Like memantine, r iluzole is a glutamate 
stabilizing agent that increases the reuptake of glutamate and is used for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .[29]  Riluzole has also been shown to improve symptoms of 
depression while decreasing extracellular glutamate in preclinical models and human subjects. [29]  
Of note, riluzole- induced decreases in glutamate in bipolar depressed subjects were observed 
within 1 week of riluzole administration. [29]   Taken together, the data support that:  
 
•  A significant percentage of breast cancer patients have symptoms of fatigue and cognitive 
dysfunction during and after treatment. 
•  Inflammation has been associated with symptoms in breast cancer patients during and after therapy.  
•  Inflammation activates a cascade of events that can lead to excess CNS glutamate which can be measured by [CONTACT_405199] .

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_405184]: Donor Funds  
Page 4 of 30 
IRB#: 00086271 Version 05 -21-2019 Modification 15  
  • Excess glutamate has been associated with multiple symptoms related to fatigue and 
cognitive dysfunction including decreased motivation and psychomotor slowing. 
• Riluzole is a drug that can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (within 1 week) reduce extracellular glutamate (quantified by [CONTACT_38692]) and like memantine, a glutamate receptor antagonist, may reduce 
symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer patients.  
 
No study has examined whether riluzole can reverse inflammation- induced glutamate changes 
and the associated  behavioral alterations in breast cancer patients. Based on our preliminary 
data and previous literature, there is reason to believe that riluzole may lower glutamate in 
breast cancer patients with increased CNS glutamate, and by [CONTACT_405200] . 
Therefore, the goals of the proposed research are to test the following hypotheses:  
 
• Compared to placebo, the glutamate stabilizing drug riluzole will decrease CNS 
glutamate in a population of breast cancer survivors with fatigue and high inflammation 
(Aim 1).  
• Decr eased CNS glutamate in breast cancer patients treated with riluzole will be 
associated with decreased symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction including 
anhedonia and psychomotor slowing (Aim 2).  
 4. Objectives:  
The primary objective of the proposed research is to provide the first data on the role of CNS 
glutamate and symptoms of fatigue in breast cancer patients using MRS  and a medication that 
has been shown to lower CNS glutamate in animal models  and human subjects. No previous 
study has examined the potential connection between increased inflammation, increased CNS glutamate and symptoms  in breast cancer patients, although there is strong clinical and 
preclinical support for an important interrelationship among these variables. Identification of a significant relationship between increased CNS glutamate and symptoms will:  
 
•  Enable the development of inflammatory biomarkers to identify patients with altered CNS glutamate.  
•  Help focus future studies using glutamate stabilizing medications and glutamate antagonists on patients most likely to respond to glutamate -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(personalization of trials and treatment). 
•  Expand treatment studies to include synergistic or sequential targeting of inflammation and glutamate to reduce symptom burden in breast cancer patients.  
 This study will also  serve as a foundation for efforts to link the impact of inflammatory 
cytokines and their relationship with increased CNS glutamate and behavior to a variety of 
cancers .  Moreover, by [CONTACT_405201] (targeting glutamate), may 
ultimately improve the quality of life of breast cancer and other cancer patients.  
 
5. Specific Aims: 
Breast cancer patients experience significant behavioral alterations including fatigue and cognitive dysfunction that persist in up to 30% of patients for months to years after therapy. 
Data from our group and others have demonstrated that alterations in behavior both during and after breast cancer treatment are associated with increased inflammation. One mechanism that 
may mediate the relationship between inflammation and behavioral changes in breast cancer 
patients is central nervous system (CNS) glutamate. Recent work from our laboratory using 
Emory IRB# 00086271  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_405184]: Donor Funds  
Page 5 of 30 
IRB#: 00086271 Version 05 -21-2019 Modification 15  
  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has found that chronic exposure to the inflammatory 
cytokine interferon (IFN) -alpha leads to increased CNS glutamate [as reflected by [CONTACT_405202]/creatine (Glu/Cr) ratio] whic h correlated with symptoms of fatigue and cognitive 
dysfunction. Similar relationships among increased inflammation (as measured by [CONTACT_319125]), 
increased CNS glutamate and symptoms of anhedonia and psychomotor slowing were also observed in patients with depressi on.  Glutamate changes are likely secondary to the capacity 
of inflammatory cytokines to block glutamate reuptake and increase glutamate release from 
astrocytes, while also activating the kynurenine pathway, leading to increased quinolinic acid, 
which can bind glutamate receptors and block glutamate reuptake. Excessive glutamate can in 
turn lead to neuronal damage.  
 
Thus, CNS glutamate may serve as a final common pathway to CNS pathology and behavioral 
and cognitive disturbances in breast cancer patients after treatment. Interestingly, memantine, a 
drug that antagonizes glutamate signaling was found to preserve cognition in cancer patients 
undergoing whole brain radiotherapy, indicating that blocking glutamate may have 
neuroprotective effects under conditions of an increased inflammatory load.  Taken together, 
these data suggest that glutamate may be an outstanding target for reversing the behavioral pathology associated with inflammation during breast cancer and its treatment. Demonstration that targeting glutamate to reverse fatigue  and cognitive changes in patients with high 
inflammation and could potentially help tr eat the long-term toxicities of breast cancer and its 
treatment. The goal of the current proposal is to test the hypothesis that reduc tion of  glutamate 
in breast cancer survivors with fatigue and high inflammation will be associated with decreased 
CNS glut amate and decreased symptoms of fatigue and cognitive function including anhedonia 
and psychomotor slowing. To test these hypotheses the following aims are proposed:  
 Aim 1: To study the impact of [ADDRESS_510869] cancer patients with 
increased fatigue (≥4 on a 10 point scale) and high inflammation (CRP>3mg/L) will be treated 
for 8 weeks with either riluzole or placebo (n=20 per group).  At baseline and at [ADDRESS_510870].

IRB#: 00086271 Version 05 -21-2019 Modification 15  
  Hypothesis 1: Breast cancer patients administered riluzole will exhibit greater decreases in 
basal ganglia a nd dACC glutamate compared to women treated with placebo.  
 
Aim 2: To determine whether decreased CNS glutamate correlates with improved 
symptoms of fatigue and cognition dysfunction. Behavioral assessments of fatigue and 
cognitive function including measures of motivation and psychomotor processing speed, attention, executive function, and memory will be assessed in the patients indicated in Aim 1 
and correlated with glutamate measures  in the basal ganglia and dACC as well as other brain 
regions as an exploratory analysis using chemical shift imaging.  
Hypothesis 2: Decreased glutamate in the basal ganglia will be associated with decreased 
fatigue and improved motivation and processing speed.  Decreased  glutamate in the dACC will 
be associated with improved executive function and improved memory  performance. 
 The proposed research will help elucidate a novel pathway to behavioral pathology in patients 
with breast cancer, while also identifying peripheral biomarkers of risk as well as a novel  
treatment . 
 
6. Study design and methods:  
 
Participant Selection  
Breast cancer research participants will be referred by [CONTACT_405203] , recruited through social media 
campaigns , or recruited through letters from the Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics. We plan 
to enroll [ADDRESS_510871] cancer patients between the ages of 21 -65 inclusive (to obtain 40 
patients with analyzable data). All breast cancer patients will have completed surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) with or without neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and with or without radiation between 1-[ADDRESS_510872] completed surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) with or 
without neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and with or without radiation.  Subjects must 
have a CRP>3mg/L and a Single Item Screening Scale for Fatigue  score of ≥4 (out of 10 points, 
0 being no fatigue and 10 being severe, incapacitating fatigue)  to be eligible for the trial . Based 
on projections that ~50% of recruited subjects will have a CRP>3mg/L and a Fatigue score ≥4 
and ~[ADDRESS_510873] cancer subjects .  No patients will be enrolled 
from vulnerable populations, including neonates, children, prisoners, or institutionalized individuals. No use will be made of fetal tissue. Potential subjects will be excluded for a number 
of medical conditions that might represent a risk for riluzole (including history of allergic reaction 
to riluzole and evidence of liver disease) and potentially confound the relationship among CNS 
glutamate, inflammation and behavior/cognition, including autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, chronic infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis B or C), pregnancy, neurologic 
disorders (including a history of  serious head trauma or seizures), liver disease (as manifested 
as an elevation in liver transaminases) and uncontrolled cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary or renal disease (as determined by [CONTACT_405204]). Subjects with a curren t or past history of schizophrenia will also be excluded. Subjects with Bipolar Disorder that 
have experienced a manic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 6 months of study entry will be excluded or at the PI’s 
discretion. Subjects receiving antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotic medications or

IRB#: [ADDRESS_510874] the immune system (e.g.  glucocorticoids, 
methotrexate) will also be excluded, unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_978] . Subjects who exhibit 
signs of an infection at screening will be rescheduled when symptoms have resolved. Subjects 
who exhibit signs of infection or a significant change from baseline test measurements  via 
safety labs will be informed. Her treating physician may be notified for follow -up or results will be 
used by [CONTACT_405205]/or study continuation.  
Compensation : For the main riluzole study,  participants will be compensated at the end of each 
study visit using ClinCard. The ClinCard is a web based, reloadable, debit card that automates 
reimbursements for clinical research participants. However, if ClinCard accessibility is not 
availabl e, participants may be compensated in the form of cash, check or gift card.  Participants  
will receive $25 for each screening visit (which could be up to 2 visits)  or $50 if they complete 
the consent and all of the screening assessments in a single visit, $25 for each completed study 
visit and $250 for each visit including an MRS scan, if scan is completed,  for compensation for 
their time and effort.  Participants will receive compensation for completed MRS scans upon 
completion of study participation.  Participants will  also receive $25 for completing cognitive 
tasks for Baseline I and Baseline II, and $[ADDRESS_510875] $5 . If participants  do not finish the 
study, we will compensate them  for the visits completed. Participants can receive a maximum of 
$1100 for study completion. If there is a considerable break between study visit procedures 
(i.e. a lapse of at least  2 hours outside of the structured study schedule), the participant may 
leave and then return to complete  the visit and  will be compensated an additional study visit ’s 
compensation of $25. Further compensation (up to an additional $25 per visit) will be provided 
to cover travel expenses if participants live equal to or greater than 50 miles outside of the Atlanta city limits . Payments  will be provided as follows:  $25 in cash for the screening visit  (s), 
$25 in cash for each study visit, $25 in cash for neurocognitive testing at Baseline I and 
Baseline II , and $50 in cash for neurocognitive testing at Week 8.  The additional compensation 
for the Effort -Expenditure for Rewards Task  will be given in  cash for each study visit when the 
task is completed. The remaining $750 will be mailed to participants  in a check at the end of  
study completion. Each participant will be asked to fill out a tax form, including their Social 
Security or Taxpayer Identification Number, in order to be reimbursed, depending on the amount and method of payment. Some payment methods involve mail coming to a participant’s 
home address, which may be seen by [CONTACT_405206]. Participants can 
decline payment if concerned about confidentiality or  will be told to discuss other payment 
options with the study team.  For the startle study, participants will be compensated an additional 
$50 per study visit for your time and effort, totaling to $[ADDRESS_510876] cancer will be recruited from local (inter -Departmental)  referral s,

signed consent form will be given to the participant and the  original document filed in a central 
study consent binder. The consent binder(s) and subject casebooks containing information gathered as part of the study will be kept in a locked office and/or cabinet.  
 
 
 Verbal Consent to Verify Breast Cancer Information  
For participants who did not undergo their breast cancer treatment within Emory Healthcare, they 
may verbally consent to having their diagnosis and treatment information (e.g. cancer stage, 
nodal involvement, types and dates of treatment, and receptor status) verified through the Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics. This verbal consent process will be recorded on an IRB -
approved verbal consent for m by [CONTACT_7355].  The study clinician may also obtain a 
written informed consent.  
 
Telephone Prescreen Interview  
A telephone prescreen interview will be conducted with study referrals following verbal consent. 
Candidates eligible to proceed with the study process will be scheduled for an appointment to 
see a study clinician.  
 
Onsite visit (s):  Trained personnel will obtain written informed consent from candidates  prior to 
initiating study procedures. Screening information will be collected by [CONTACT_405208], 
as well as obtaining collateral history and data from other relevant sources (e. g. medical 
records, referring physician).  
 Screening will include the following assessments: (1) History of medical and psychiatric 
conditions (2) screening laboratory evaluations, (3) subject height and weight measurements  
and waist circumference obtained by [CONTACT_3655]  4) Concomitant Medications  5) Adverse Events  
6) MRI Safety Form  7) Demographics  and 8) assessments below:  
 Mini-Mental State Exam  (MMSE ) is a 27 -item intervie wer administered questionnaire widely 
used for the evaluation of general cognitive functioning and identification of altered mental status. At screening, subjects will be excluded for score ≤28 (unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_978]), which is evidence of mild cognitive impairment. [30] 
WRAT -3 is a very brief screening measure for reading level. Participants evaluated at less than 
an 8
th grade reading level may not participate unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_978].  
Child Trauma Ques tionnaire (CTQ)  is a standardized, retrospective 28- item self -report inventory 
that measures the severity of different types of  childhood trauma. Participants will not be 
excluded for history of childhood trauma.

  Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized to 100 mg of riluzole (50 mg po BID) or an identical appearing 
placebo in a 1:1 fashion with no stratification. Subjects will be instructed to t ake the study 
medication on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after meals). The dosage of riluzole 
is based on several clinical trials that have previously used this medication to treat a number of psychiatric disorders ranging from depression to generalized anxiety disorder as well as 
ALS. [31] A randomly generated sequence of assignments to riluzole or placebo will be created 
and maintained by [CONTACT_55775]. Subjects will be randomized in blocks of 4. If a subject drops out prior to receiving the first dose of medication,  she will not be included in data analyses 
and her randomization assignment will “roll over” to the next recruited subject until [ADDRESS_510882] taken less than 75% of their medication may be excluded from study participation. If study removal occurs at or after the Week 4 study visit, the patient will undergo 
exit safety laboratory testing and physical examination.  
Main Riluzole Study  
 
Psychiatric Assessments  
 
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS)  (healthy controls only) is a 16 item self -
report instrument that includes assessment of nine diagnostic symptom domains used to characterize a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  At screening, subjects will be referred to PI [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s 
designee for a QIDS score ≥ 16. 
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) is a clinician -assisted inventory used to assess 3 
types of childhood abuse: sexual, physical, and emotional.  
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a 27 -item interviewer administered questionnaire widely 
used for the evaluation of general cognitive functioning and identification of altered mental 
status. At screening, subjects will be excluded for score ≤28 (unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_1600]), which is evidence of mild cognitive impairment. [30] 
WRAT-3 is a very brief screening measure for reading level. Participants evaluated at less than 
an 8
th grade reading level may not participate unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_978].  
 
Self-report Forms  
 
Single Item Screening Scale for Fatigue  is a single question self-report screening instrument 
that asks subjects to rate their fatigue on a scale of 0 -10 where 0 = No fatigue and 10 = Worst 
fatigue you can imagine. Ratings are categorized as none to mild (0– 3), moderate (4–6) or 
Severe (7– 10). This screening strategy for fatigue is recommended by [CONTACT_337579] (NCCN) Guidelines. 
Pain assessment scale is a Likert style self -report pain measurement (10 items; 1=no pain; 
10=extreme pain) to be completed by [CONTACT_405210]. Participants reporting a current pain level of >5 may not be 
approved to participate unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_941] P.I.  
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Self Reported (IDS -SR) is a 30- item self- report 
instrument with excellent psychometric properties that was designed to measure symptom 
constructs consistent with current psychiatric diagnostic nosology and has been widely used as 
a self -report outcome measure of depression in t reatment trials. [32, 33] Of note, the IDS -SR is

severe depressive symptoms) or endorses a score >2 on the suicide item of the IDS -SR 
(Question 18), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_405186]. 
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)  is a 20-item scale used to evaluate the presence 
and severity of fatigue among subjects by [CONTACT_6270] -reports. [34] The MFI assesses [ADDRESS_510884] cancer patients, 
and a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points has been established. [35, 36] 
PROMIS -Fatigue Short Form  is a 7-item scale developed by [CONTACT_33230] -Reported Outcome 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a part of the NIH Roadmap Initiative which is focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a publicly available resource of standardized, accurate, and efficient 
outcome measures of symptoms, distress, and functioning. The criterion for a minimally 
clinically important difference in patients with advanced- stage cancer is a 3 to 5 point difference 
in raw score. [37]  Recommendations for high priority research on cancer -related fatigue 
recommend use of the PROMIS fatigue scale to allow comparison of results across studies.[ 38] 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) will be used to assess sleep quality over the past 
month. The scale contains 15 multiple- choice items that inquire about frequency of sleep 
disturbances and subjective sleep quality and 4 write- in items that inquire about typi[INVESTIGATOR_405187], 
wake -up time, sleep latency, and sleep duration. The PSQI generates seven scores that 
correspond to relevant domains of sleep, and each score ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 
(severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range of 0–
21).  
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  is a 21- item self- report measure of anxiety -related symptoms, 
rated on a 4- point Likert scale based on the patient’s experience in the last two weeks.  
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) is a nine -item measurement used to ass ess depressive 
symptoms and suicidal ideation. Study psychiatrists will be alerted to any participants scoring > 
[ADDRESS_510885] relevant to the proposed Aims and Hypothesis.  
Baseline 1:  
 
Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT): In this effort -discounting variant, subjects are 
presented with a choice between two task -difficulty levels in order to obtain monetary 
rewards. [39] In each trial, subjects must make repeated manual button presses within a certain 
period of time.   To succeed in each trial, subjects must meet or exceed the required number of 
button presses within the time allotted. Easy -task trials require [ADDRESS_510886] 
passed.   There are also probability cues attached to each trial —88%, 50%, and 12% —that 
determine whether a trial may result in compensation, upon completion. This information will be made known to the subjects at the start of the task. Upon completion of all trials, three of the 
trials will be randomly selected and the subject will receive compensation from those trials 
based on the choices they made. This payment may range from approximately $3.00 - $24. This

IRB#: [ADDRESS_510887] (TMT) is a commonly used neuropsychological measure with updated 
norms that has two parts.
 Part A (TMT -A) requires the patient to connect numbered circles in 
order and reflects a measure of basic attention and processing speed, while Part B (TMT- B) 
requires the patient to alternate between numbers and letters and is considered a measure of 
executive function, including planning and organization.  
Digit Symbol Task: The Digit Symbol Task is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale (WAIS) and consists of rows of blank squares, each printed with a randomly assigned 
number (1 -9).  A key is printed above these rows and shows each number paired with a 
different nonsense symbol. The subject’s task is to fill in the blanks with the corresponding symbols as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2595]. This test involves graphimotor speed, visual scanning and 
memory, with about half of the variance being accounted for by [CONTACT_156732], a third by 
[CONTACT_156733] 4 -5% by [CONTACT_85801] [40]. As part of the WAIS, this test is frequently used in 
neuro- psychology and relevant norms and test -retest reliability have been well established [41]. 
Performance on the Digit Symbol Test has been found to correlate with subcortical atrophy 
(esp. as measured by [CONTACT_224361] -caudate ratio) in disorders involving the basal ganglia including 
Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis .[42, 43]  
Finger Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_292713] (FTT): This task uses a specially adapted tapper that the subject is asked 
to tap as fast as possible using the index finger.  The subject is given 5 consecutive 10 -second 
trials for both the preferred and non -preferred hands.  The finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_405188] 5 trials and is computed for each hand.   
Reaction Time Task (CANTAB):  The reaction time test includes simple and choice reaction 
time tasks and is divided into 5 stages requiring increasingly complex chains of responses and providing distinction between reaction (or decision) time and movement latencies  
     
 
Baseline 2:  
 Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) : A test of verbal memory and learning using list 
learning that measures ability to use strategies to improve learning.  
Delayed Matching To Sample (CANTAB): [44, 45] Variables: Response time, Discrimination 
(Hits/False Alarms). A measure of visual memory where subjects are asked to identify objects 
shown previously at various time points.  
Spatial Working Memory (CANTAB): [46] Variables:   Response time, Correct responses. A 
test of ability to remember spatial localization of objects presented previously  
Stroop Color and Word Test : Subject is requested to name [CONTACT_242599] a word both when the 
color of the ink matches the name [CONTACT_405237].  Prolongation in reaction time and number of inaccurate responses during the 
name- ink color mismatch condition are measured.

Psychiatric Assessments  
 
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS ) is an interview -administered diagnostic 
instrument measuring PTSD. The CAPS assesses lifetime and current PTSD. It also yields 
continuous measures for the severity of both overall PTSD and of the three symptom clusters 
(intrusion, avoidance, and arousal). The frequency and intensity of scores for each of the 17 
diagnostic criteria are summed to arrive at a t otal severity score. [47, 48]           
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview  (MINI)  is a commonly used psychiatric 
structured diagnostic interview that will be used to assess psychiatric disorders. A cover sheet 
will be used to provide interviewers with an overview of participants’ medical history.  
Modified PTS D Symptom Scale (MPSS)  is a 17 -item interview used to aid in the detection and 
diagnosis of PTSD. The MPSS will be used in this study as a rapid assessment tool because of its reasonably good diagnostic validity for PTSD .[49, 50 ] 
 
Self-Report Forms  
 
Demographics Form  (DF) covers demographics; family composition; living situation; and 
personal and family psychiatric medical, and substance abuse history; and income and education.   
Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC)  is a [ADDRESS_510890] 
reliability, and convergent and divergent validity .[51] 
Menstrual Cycle Questionnaire is a self -report measure that covers menstrual cycle history.  
Beck Depression Inventory II  (BDI-II) is a 21 -item measure of depression symptoms. It is a 
commonly used screening instrument for depressive symptoms.  Traumatic Events Interview  (TEI)  is an instrument assessing lifetime history of traumatic 
experiences including experiencing, witnessing, and being confronted with these stressors.  
Life Events Checklist is a self report measure to screen for traumatic events in the  
participant’s life.  
Post Testing Questions will be used to assess participants.  
Post Traumatic Growth Inventory is a 21 -item scale that will be used to assess positive 
outcomes as a result of cancer survivorship .[52] 
Post Testing Question s will be used to assess participants’ perception of the tasks.   
Saliva Pre- collection Questions  will be used to assess quality of saliva collection.   
 
Psychophysiological Task  
Fear-Potentiated Startle:  The following methods will allow us to assess fear acquisition, within- 
and between- session extinction, and conditioned inhibition (learned safety), as well as subjects’ 
awareness of reinforcement contingencies in the experiment. The aversive stimulus (US ) in 
these studies will be a [ADDRESS_510891] with an intensity of 140 p.s.i. directed to the larynx as described in similar human fear conditioning studies. [53-55] Airblasts will be emitted by a 
compressed air tank connected to polyethylene tubing and controlled by a solenoid switch. Conditioned stimuli will be presented as visual stimuli according to our previously published 
methods and will consist of colored geometric shapes presented on a computer monitor mounted to the wall of the sound attenuated test chamber. [ 56] The CSs that are reinforced with 
an airblast  US (CS+’s) and those that are not reinforced (CS -‘s) will be counterbalanced across 
subjects. Stimuli will be presented using SuperLab 3.0 for Windows (Cedrus, Inc.) and

IRB#: [ADDRESS_510892] (Measurements  
Computing, Inc).   This paradigm has been successfully performed previously in our group. [ 56] 
Physiological Variables 
Electromyographic activity : We will collect electromyography (EMG) recordings of the 
corrugator supercilii muscle (eyebrow muscle).  According to the guidelines from Cacciopo 
and colleagues [57], two 5 mm Ag/AgCl electrodes will be placed above the right eyebrow.  
EMG activity will be acquired at a sampling rate of 1kHz, amplified and digitized using the 
EMG module of the Biopac MP150 for Windows (Biopac Systems, Inc., Aero Camino, CA).  
Acoustic startle:  The acoustic startle response (eyeblink component) will be measured via 
EMG of the right orbicularis oculi  muscle. Two 5 mm Ag/AgCl pre- gelled disposable 
electrodes will be positioned approximately 1 cm under the pupil and 1 cm below the lateral 
canthus. The startle probe (noise burst) will be a 108- dB (A) SPL, [ADDRESS_510893] of broadband 
noise with a near instantaneous rise time.  
Electrocardiogram activity:  Heart -rate and heart -rate variability (HRV) will be measured 
using the ECG module of the Biopac system at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. One 5mm Ag/AgCl electrode will be placed on the chest above the right clavicle, another electrode will be 
placed on the chest under the left side of the ribcage. 
Electrodermal activity:  Skin conductance level and skin resistance data will be acquired at 
a sampling rate of 1 kHz using the GSR module of the Biopac system.   Two 5 mm Ag/AgCl 
disposable electrodes filled with isotonic paste will be attached to middle phalanges of the 
second and fourth finger of the non -dominant hand.  
Response keypad:  To assess subject awareness and US expectancy during each 
experimental session subjects will respond on a response keypad (SuperLab, Cedrus Corp.) 
in coordination with the EMG startle response moni toring system (SR -LAB, San Diego 
Instruments).  During the fear conditioning sessions subjects will press a button marked “+” if they expect a CS to be followed by [CONTACT_36432], a button marked “ -“ if they do not expect a CS 
to be followed by [CONTACT_36432], and a button marked “0” if they are uncertain of what to expect.  Sniffin’ Sticks:  Participants’ ability to discriminate odor will be assessed based on 
identification of every -day odors using commercially available, “Sniffin’ Sticks”. [58] 
Saliva Collection:  Saliva samples will be obtained during the experiment. These will be 
stored in a -80°C freezer for hormonal analysis  and DNA methylation analysis .  
 
 
 
Reliability of Behavioral and Neurocognitive Ratings  
The collection of WRAT -3, MMSE, CTQ and medical and psychiatric information (acute status 
and history) will be collected by [CONTACT_7355]. [CONTACT_405239], Assistant Professor of Psychology at Emory University, will train staff on the administration of, Effort - 
Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) . 
 
Laboratory Variables  
 
Blood collection: Research bloods will be collected by [CONTACT_405211] -containing 
vacutainer tube using standard sterile technique. Plasma and buffy coat for the evaluation of 
concentrations of cytokines and their receptors as well as CRP will be obtained by [CONTACT_405212] 1000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Plasma and buffy coat will be removed

  separately, aliquoted into siliconized polypropylene tubes, and stored at -80°C until batch assay. 
Bloods will also be collected by [CONTACT_405213] -20C.  At screening, CRP will be processed in Emory Medical Laboratories  
and/or using the Diazyme hsCRP POC Test Kit. This kit produces rapid results using a finger 
prick method to collect [ADDRESS_510894]. Brian Dias at the 
Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University for the evaluation of exosomes, 
RNA, and hormones. Tempus tubes and buffy coats will be sent to the Emory Integrated 
Genomics Core for RNA extraction, gene expression, mRNA profiling, epi[INVESTIGATOR_405189].  
Plasma cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors: Customized  high sensitivity Fluorokine 
MAP Multiplex  Human Biomarker Panels (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) will be used to 
measure plasma TNF- alpha,  sTNFR1 and 2, IL- 1ra, IL- 6 and sIL -6R. All samples will be 
assayed in duplicate according to manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control plasma of both 
low and high cytokine concentrations will be included with every assay. The mean inter- and 
intra-assay coefficients of variation for control samples are reliably 10% or less.  
C-reactive protein ( CRP): Plasma CRP will be assessed with a high sensitivity turbidimetric 
assay. Sensitivity is 0.18 mg/L, range of measure is 0.2 to 80 mg/L, and functional sensitivity (at 
20% CV) is 0.2 mg/ L.  
Tryptophan and Kynurenine: Free tryptophan and kynurenine plasma concentrations will be 
determined by [CONTACT_5019]- performance liquid chromatography in the laboratory of [CONTACT_405240] 
or other laboratories with equivalent expertise at the PI’s discretion. Gene expression and epi[INVESTIGATOR_7009]:  As indicated above, blood will be obtained for analysis of 
inflammatory mediators and signaling pathways.  
Saliva Collection:  Saliva will be collected after the startle task by [CONTACT_405214]. This sample will be analyzed for hormones and DNA methylation changes  present at 
time of study visit.  
 
 
MRI Scans  
MRS acquisition and processing: All images will be acquired using a Siemens 3 Prisma 3T 
scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA, [LOCATION_003]) equipped with a maximum gradient 
strength of 80 mT/m and a rise time of [ADDRESS_510895] prescription, anatomic images will be obtained using a T1 -weighted MPRAGE sequence with 
the following parameters: TR/TI/TE =2300/900/3.02 msec; flip angle=8°; FOV read=256 mm; matrix=256; slice thickness=1 mm; GRAPPA factor of 0; total scan time=10 minutes.  
Single Voxel MRS Acquisition:  Single Voxel Spectroscopy (SVS) is used to quantitate 
neurometabolites of interest in target brain regions. The scanning protocol and post-processing 
methodology will be used in accordance with previously published reports, [24, 27] but modified 
for the Prisma 3T platform. SVS will be acquired using Chemical Shift Selective (CHESS) -based 
MRS sequence using settings of TR/TE = 3000/30 ms, sampling size=128 averages, bandwidth=1048Hz with sampling size = 1024, 128 averages. Two voxels with size of 17 x 30 x 
17 mm3 located in the left and right basal ganglia will be used for SVS. Spatial localization will 
be implemented using PRESS technique. [59] Numerically optimized Shinnar -Le Roux (SLR)

  radio frequency pulses will be used for PRESS (90°, 180°, 180°) and CHESS (90°, 90°, 
90°). [60] Four unsuppressed water FIDs (free induction decay) will  be also acquired for eddy 
current and phase correction[ 61] and to compute metabolite/water ratios if needed (LC Model). 
The FWHM of the unsuppressed water peak will be optimized to <14 Hz by  [CONTACT_405215]. The 
spectral data will not be apodized.  
Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI):  The application of a single voxel to a specific region limits 
evaluation of diffuse or global cortical and subcortical glutamate abnormalities that may occur in 
association with inflammation and have been proposed to occur in unipolar depression. [62] 
Simultaneous sampling from multiple voxels placed bilaterally on the basal ganglia gray matter, white matter and adjacent neocortical regions will provide a more expansive evaluation of 
relevant brain structures that have been implicated in the impact of inflammatory cytokines on behavior. CSI will be acquired using 2D Point Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) -based MRSI 
sequence using settings of TR=1590 ms, TE=30 ms, averages= 7, matrix=16×16, voxel size=11. 3×11.3×15 mm3, slice thickness=15mm. The raw files will be processed using LC 
Model package -Version 6.2- 2b.[63] 
Post Processing:  
Metabolite Spectral Fitting:  The LC Model is an operator -independent commercial software 
package that fits in vivo metabolite spectra using model resonances acquired from multiple 
compounds in standard phantom solutions. The water suppressed time- domain data will be 
analyzed between 1.0 ppm and 4.0 ppm without T1 and T2 correction. The basis set provided by [CONTACT_405216][ 63] will be used and then scaled to account for receiver gain 
differences. While the entire 18 metabolite basis set would be entered during metabolite fitting, the analysis will only include metabolite variances (Cramer Rao Lower Bounds or CRLB) <25. Use of a high field strength (Prisma 3T) scanner and short TE (=30 msec) sequence has 
enabled us to calculate Glu/Cr with high reliability and very low metabolite variance (CRLB <10) 
during our previously published MRS studies. [24, 27]  
Water scaling and relaxometry:  The post processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_405190] d 
absolute quantitation, metabolite/water and metabolite/creatine values. LC model provides an automated water scaling settings which will be used (DOWS). All data (water signal and water 
suppressed data) will be phased followed by [CONTACT_405217]. The 
relaxometry data will then be fitted to obtain water reference data and in the case of gray matter 
following segregation of the CSF and tissue water constituent. Finally, water signal will be 
scaled to that of the resulting value obtained in previous steps. The water scaling portion of the post processing will be done as soon as data is acquired.  
Tissue correction and segmentation: T1 -weighted images will be segmented into gray matter 
(GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) compartments using FreeSurfer 
(https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki ) on the whole brain T1 images. A volume of interest 
(VOI) will be generated on the T1 images, matching the location and size of MRS voxel. 
Volumes of GM, WM and CSF segments in this volume- of-interest will then be generated using 
FreeSurfer. The absolute metabolite concentrations generated by [CONTACT_405218] C = Co x 1 /(1-fCSF), where C is corrected 
metabolite concentrations, Co is metabolite concentrations generated by [CONTACT_405219]. [64, 65]  The final output of the absolute metabolite quantitation 
will be provided in units of molality. Absolute quantitation using CSI data is challenged by [CONTACT_405220] [66] and often requires customized automated programs to 
correct for atrophic tissue changes, B0 field inhomogeneity distortions, and water suppression in 
each subvoxel may be less than optimal.  Consequently, CSI data will be assessed using 
metabolite values normalized to creatine.  This will be accomplished after ensuring that raw 
uncorrected concentrations of creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) are not significantly

myoinositol (InS) and n -acetyl aspartate (NAA) will also be conducted.  
 
Management of MRS Incidental Findings  
The purpose of these scans is not to make a clinical determination of patients’ brain health.  
However, if any incidental finding is noticed during the scan, the information will be provided to patients or their medical provider -of-record for further management.  Incidental findings are 
those abnormalities seen in patients’ brain images during the scanning process, which may or may not be of clinical importance.  Follow -up of the scan findings will be the responsibility of the 
patients’ Emory Healthcare provider -of-record.

obtained from saliva will be used to assess hormone levels and DNA methylation changes at 
time of study visit. Clinical data will be used to assess eligibility and safety and will be collected 
via interview and documented by [CONTACT_75872]. Standardized clinician- administered  and self -
report assessments will be administered and collected by [CONTACT_405228].  Blood will be obtained in the clinic laboratories by [CONTACT_54339], and the samples will be 
collected and processed by [CONTACT_3462].  
All data , including questionnaires and blood will be coded by [CONTACT_337112]. 
Subjects’ names will not be linked to their biological samples or clinical data in REDCap. Subject name [CONTACT_405238] a casebook in a locked cabinet and/or 
office. Only IRB qualified research staff and study physicians will have access to subject 
identifiers. Research personnel analyzing blood or clinical data will not be provided information 
from which they could identify subjects. All information will be obtained solely to determine 
eligibility for study participation or for research purposes. Nevertheless, any significant 
abnormalities uncovered will be reported to the subject and his/her treating physician for follow -
up or will be used by [CONTACT_405229]/or study

 9. Data Collection and Management :  
The data management team will use REDCap. [67] REDCap allows database construction, an 
interface for collecting data, data validation, and automated export procedures for data 
downloads to statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R). Scales will be completed securely via 
the internet via standard web access. Research staff will enter scale responses directly into the 
REDCap electronic assessment forms. Electronic assessments will be completed on computer terminals under supervision of study staff. [CONTACT_10017] is currently using REDCap for [ADDRESS_510898] extensive experience with its usage.  Data will be 
stored indefinitely in a secure location until no longer needed by [CONTACT_1697].

10. Statistical Analysis:  
 Aim 1: To study the impact of [ADDRESS_510899] cancer patients with increased fatigue and high inflammation.  
Hypothesis 1: Breast cancer patients administered riluzole will exhibit greater decreases in 
basal ganglia and dACC glutamate compared to women treated with placebo.  
Mixed -effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) will be employed to examine effects of 
group, time and their interaction on left and right basal ganglia glutamate or dACC controlling for 
baseline glutamate concentrations in separate analyses  for each brain region. Relevant 
covariates including age, sex, race (white/non -white) and body mass index (BMI),  
socioeconomic status (as measured by [CONTACT_405230]), educational status, tumor stage, 
tumor receptor status (where appropriate), timing (adjuvant versus neoadjuvant) of 
chemotherapy and radiation (yes/no) will be sequentially tested in the models for goodness of fit 
(Akaike Information Criterion) and included as appropriate.  
 
Aim 2: To determine whether decreased CNS glutamate correlates with improved 
symptoms of fatigue and cognition dysfunction.  
Hypothesis 2: Decreased glutamate in the basal ganglia will be associated with decreased 
fatigue and improved motivation and proces sing speed.  Decreased  glutamate in the dACC will 
be associated with improved executive function and memory performance.  
Random intercept linear mixed models will be used to assess whether change in left or right basal ganglia or dACC glutamate predict change in fatigue scores or change in neurocognitive  
function over time. Models will be adjusted for relevant clinical covariates (including IDS- SR, 
PSQI, BAI) as indicated above.  Separate analyses will be run for each behavioral outcome 
(MFI, PROMIS) as we ll tests of cognition (HVLT- R, TMT PASAT COWAT RT FTT, RTT, and 
DSST) and motivation ( DDT, EEfRT,  Subjective Value Task,  Effort and Delay Task, Daily 
Assessment/Mobile App Task, Gamble Task, and Go No -Go Variant Task. ).  Type I errors as a 
result of multiple testing will be controlled by [CONTACT_2329] a step down Bonferroni procedure. [68]  
 11. Power Analysis : 
A power analysis was conducted using our preliminary  data examining a cohort of 50 
unmedicated patients with major depression. [27] The study sample size was powered on the 
basis of Aim 1, which represents the primary hypothesis of the study that riluzole will decrease 
basal ganglia glutamate. Given a sample size of 40, an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.80, we will 
be able to detect an effect size of Cohen’s d=0.5 which falls in the moderate range (computed 
using G*power).  This  effect size is well within the range of the effect size (d) of the differences 
in basal ganglia glutamate concentrations between high ( CRP >3mg/L) and low ( CRP <1mg/L)  
inflammation , which are expected in this study.  
 
12. Potential Study Risks: 
 
Main Riluzole Study Risks:  There are 4 major areas of potential risk in the proposed study 
stemming from 1) neuropsychiatric assessments, 2) blood drawing, 3) MRS scanning and 4) 
riluzole treatment. Neuropsychiatric assessments may uncover unpleasant feelings about the subject’s present emotional state. The risks of blood drawing include discomfort, bruising, 
infection, bleeding and fainting. Undergoing MRS scan poses no more risk than undergoing a 
routine MRI scan. Nevertheless, physical discomfort due to lying in the scanner, occasional 
headaches due to scanner sounds and previously unrecognized claustrophobic attacks are the

  prominent adverse effects of the procedure.   Major c omplications of riluzole (Rilutek) include an 
allergic reaction to riluzole or the components of the tablet and hepati c toxicity. Riluzole is 
contraindicated in individuals who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions to riluzole or any 
of the tablet components  and in individuals who have hepatic disease or who have baseline 
transaminases greater than [ADDRESS_510900] agree, with the study doctor  or 
PI’s designee, on a method of birth control to use throughout the study.  To ensure no 
contraindications with alcohol, participants will be told not to consume more than 1 alcoholic 
drink per day while on study medication ([ADDRESS_510901] commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of RILUTEK in 1,396 
individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , those reported more frequently than with placebo 
treatment  were : asthenia, nausea, elevations  in liver function tests, dizziness, decreased lung 
function, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting, vertigo, circumoral paresthesia, anorexia and somnolence. Table [ADDRESS_510902] common treatment -emergent adverse 
reactions considered possibly related to medication and for which the incidence was ≥1% in an open label Phase IV confirmatory trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of 414 patients.  
 Startle Study Risks:  
The most common risks and discomforts expected in this study are: 
Risks associated with interviews: Psychological tests and interviews can sometimes bring up 
painful emotions. These emotions may include sadness, worry, or increased anxiety. If you have 
trauma-related stress symptoms, you may have an increase in nightmares or flashbacks related 
to your traumatic experiences. You are free not to answer any questions you wish. You may 
stop participating in the study at any time. This will not in any way affect  your future care.  
Risks associated with the acoustic startle test: During the startle measurement, scrubbing your skin with cleanser or application of skin tape may cause skin irritation. The noise level you will hear during the startle test session is about what you hear on a train. For most people, this 
sound level is not uncomfortable. If the sounds or airblasts cause you discomfort, you can stop 
the test session at any time. Withdrawal from the study will not affect your future care. There 
also may be unknown risks, discomforts or side effects  
The less common risks and discomforts expected in this study are:  
Risks associated with the psychophysiological procedure: You may become tired from sitting in 
front of the computer, or may become uncomfortable sitting in one position for a long period of 
time. You can take a break at any point during these tasks and you can stop at any point during 
the visit.  
Risks associated with the saliva collection: You may feel uncomfortable producing saliva and spi[INVESTIGATOR_405191]. You are free to take as long as you need for this process, you 
can take a break at any point, or discontinue the process if you wish.

Every effort will be taken to prevent injury or distress that may result from this study. Care will 
be taken to avoid bringing about undue psychological distress during the self -reported 
questionnaires. In the event that a subject becomes unduly distressed  or scores >32 on the

  significant experience in the technique. In addition, the volume of blood withdrawn for this study 
will not exceed 40 mL over the course of the study (including screening and assessment 
visits).To minimize discomfort during the MRS scanning, patients will be provided with a head 
cushion and earplugs. Patients will also be informed about the progress of the procedure 
through a remote microphone. In the case of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_405192], the 
scanning session will be terminated and patient provided enough support to cope with the 
feelings induced by [CONTACT_218862].  If a patient is uncomfortable with the skin cleansing during the 
psychophysiological task, it will be omitted. Patients will be told about the airblast prior to beginning the task. If they are uncomfortable with this or any part of the task, the task will be 
stopped.  To reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions to riluzole, all patients will have a 
thorough history of allergic reactions reviewed and their first dose of riluzole will be admi nistered 
under supervision of a study physician or nurse practitioner. In addition, all patients will be screened for evidence of liver disease including a screen for liver transaminases as well as 
hepatitis B and C and HIV.  Liver transaminases will also be monitored at weeks 4 and 8, and 
subjects will be instructed to inform staff of any gastrointestinal symptoms.   
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
Although no high risk procedures are being conducted as part of this study, we will be following 
patients on an FDA approved study medication for [ADDRESS_510905] -party oversight committee. The DSMB is described in detail below. In 
addition, study clinicians will be available by [CONTACT_37160] 24 hrs/[ADDRESS_510906] regulations and procedures. The Emory IRB Reportable Events Guidelines are included in an  attachment.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_405193].  Individuals who exhibit any evidence of an allergic reaction including rash, hives or difficulty breathing and individuals who exhibit more than a two- fold elevation in liver 
transaminases will be discontinued from the study and followed until the allergic reaction

IRB#: [ADDRESS_510907] taken less than 75% of their medication may be excluded from study participation. If study  removal occurs 
at or after the 4 week study visit, the patient will undergo exit safety laboratory testing and physical examination. Urine drug tests will be conducted at each visit (except week 2) using test kits. Individuals who test positive for drugs of abuse may be terminated at the discretion of the PI. 
 Composition of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
Frequency of DSMB review for this protocol will follow recommendations from the IRB based on the assessed risk status of the study. The DSMB for  this study will consist of the Clinical 
Research Oversight Committee with members including Boadie Dunlop, M.D. Chairman, Larry Tune M.D. , Marian Evatt, MD and Tanja Mletzco MA.  They have agreed to serve as the external 
DSMB for investigator initiated clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_337123] & Behavioral Sciences. If the DSMB requires additional specialized expertise to evaluate safety issues related to the performance of this study, a relevant specialist will be consulted by [CONTACT_4318].  
Procedures and Responsibilities of the DSMB  
 The DSMB will meet monthly . This protocol will be submitted to the DSMB 
simultaneously with the initial submission to the Emory IRB. The DSMB will review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring. Once per year (or after 6 months if the protocol is considered 'high risk' by [CONTACT_1201]), the DSMB will review a report from the study’s data manager that includes: the number of participants who signed consent for the study and were randomized, the number of post -randomization dropouts, reasons for these dropouts, and 
any safety concerns, adverse events, an up- to-date consent form, and measures taken to 
protect confidentiality (e.g., data and tape storage, use of coded ID numbers, etc.). The DSMB will also review the Principal Investigator’s summary of any new data or evidence that might alter the risk/benefit ratio for participating in the study (e.g., newly published studies, etc.). After reviewing this information, the DSMB will issue its own report summarizing any serious and unexpected adverse events or other unanticipated problems that involve risk to study participants, and whether these appear related to the study -based interventions or research 
assessment protocols.  
 There will be regular, ongoing communication between the PI, Emory’s IRB, and the 
DSMB. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_405194]’s IRB according to standard regulations. A copy will be sent to the DSMB. Actions taken by [CONTACT_405232].

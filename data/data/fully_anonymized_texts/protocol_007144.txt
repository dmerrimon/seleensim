    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	2	 Concept Synopsis and Study Schema Each year, ~[ADDRESS_877140] two-thirds of the women and half of the men who are regular blood donors are iron deficient. In order to manage the inventory, red blood cell (RBC) units destined for transfusion can be stored for up to [ADDRESS_877141] prove to the FDA that, on average, using healthy volunteers, more than 75% of transfused red cells remain in circulation for [ADDRESS_877142]-transfusion recovery. RBCs from iron-deficient donors may be specifically damaged by [CONTACT_653732]. In studies with a mouse model of iron deficiency (with hemoglobin levels similar to those that are acceptable for human blood donation), we found a mean 10.6% further decrease in the 24-hour post-transfusion recovery of refrigerator-stored red cells from iron-deficient animals, as compared to the post-transfusion recovery from iron-replete littermates. A comparable decrement in post-transfusion recovery of refrigerator-stored red cells from iron-deficient human volunteer blood donors would result in many of these units failing to meet established quality standards for clinical use. This study will also test whether giving iron deficient donors their iron back will improve the quality of their red cells during refrigerator storage.   Research Question(s)/Hypothesis(es):  Primary 1.  The 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recovery from units obtained from iron-deficient donors will not meet FDA standards for clinical use.  2.  The 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recovery from units obtained after intravenous iron repletion will improve significantly and will meet FDA standards for clinical use.  Secondary  1.  Iron therapy will improve neurocognition and emotional well-being in donors with iron deficient erythropoiesis.  2.  Metabolite levels in the transfusate will be associated with 24-hour post-transfusion RBC recovery and iron status.  
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	3	Study Schema: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. [ADDRESS_877143] measure for the quality of RBCs destined for transfusion is the 51Cr-radiolabeled 24-hour RBC recovery study. Thus, a small aliquot of the transfused RBCs will be radiolabeled and injected into the volunteers on day 41 or 42 of storage. RBC recovery will be calculated from samples obtained at 5min, 7.5min, 10min, 12.5min, 15min, 30-minutes, 1-hour and 24 hours after autologous infusion as per the standardized protocol.4 For secondary outcomes, study surveys and neurocognitive assessments to assess symptoms of anemia and iron deficiency will also be performed prior to donation and prior to infusion. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind manner, these donors will then receive either intravenous saline or low-molecular weight iron dextran (or ferric carboxymaltose if iron dextran is unavailable due to supply) within 1-day to 4-weeks after the first post-transfusion recovery study. After five months, they will donate a second RBC unit, similarly stored for [ADDRESS_877144]-transfusion recovery difference from after treatment to baseline, between the groups receiving intravenous saline and iron.

    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	7	1.  Background and Significance: General Introduction. Iron deficiency is common among regular blood donors, but the recovery and quality of RBC units from iron-deficient donors has not been rigorously examined. Evidence from both animal and human studies indicate that when the iron supply for erythropoiesis is inadequate, the RBCs produced have multiple metabolic defects that impair their ability to tolerate refrigerated storage. Our studies in a mouse model demonstrated decreased post-transfusion recovery of refrigerator-stored RBCs obtained from iron-deficient donors. The planned studies will identify human donors at greatest risk of providing RBCs with poor post-transfusion recovery by [CONTACT_2329] a combination of a decreased serum ferritin concentration and increased RBC zinc protoporphyrin, as described below. To evaluate unequivocally the role of iron deficiency in poor post-transfusion RBC recovery, intravenous iron will be used for iron repletion.   Serum ferritin and RBC zinc protoporphyrin detect iron-deficient erythropoiesis in volunteer blood donors. Iron deficiency, a decrease in the amount of body iron, is detected clinically by [CONTACT_653733] (e.g., serum ferritin), and of iron supply (e.g., RBC zinc protoporphyrin). In the absence of complicating factors, as iron stores decrease, serum ferritin levels decline; a serum ferritin level less than 12 µg/L is virtually diagnostic of the absence of marrow iron stores. RBC zinc protoporphyrin monitors the supply of iron available for RBC production. In the developi[INVESTIGATOR_653717], the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX is the final step in producing heme for incorporation into hemoglobin. If iron is unavailable, divalent zinc is incorporated instead, producing zinc protoporphyrin, which binds to hemoglobin and persists for the life of the RBC as a biochemical indicator of an inadequate supply of iron for RBC production.1,3  Four successive stages of iron deficiency can be distinguished (Fig. 2). Reduced iron stores (not shown): As iron stores decrease, serum ferritin levels decline proportionally. Iron depletion: Iron depletion develops when iron stores are absent, but iron delivery to the erythroid marrow for producing hemoglobin and other functional iron compounds is maintained by [CONTACT_653734]. With absent iron stores, the serum ferritin falls to <15 µg/L. Because the iron supply for RBC production is maintained, RBC zinc 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	8	protoporphyrin levels remain in the reference range. Iron-deficient erythropoiesis: With further reductions in body iron, the lack of iron limits production of hemoglobin and other iron-requiring compounds, resulting in iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Nonetheless, the effect on the circulating hemoglobin concentration is insufficient to be detected by [CONTACT_653735], which currently only includes a hemoglobin test. As newly formed RBCs replace senescent RBCs, RBC zinc protoporphyrin progressively increases, providing an index reflecting the severity and duration of the inadequate supply of iron for erythropoiesis. Further decreases in the nominal serum ferritin levels have no physiological meaning. Thus, the combination of a serum ferritin <15 µg/L and an increased RBC zinc protoporphyrin (i.e., >80 µmol/mol heme), is highly specific for iron-deficient erythropoiesis.1,3 Iron-deficiency anemia: Further diminution in body iron produces frank iron-deficiency anemia, which would result in donor deferral.   Iron deficiency is common in volunteer blood donors. In the [LOCATION_002] in 2011, of the donors who provided the ~15.7 million units of RBCs that were collected, 69% were repeat donors.5 In addition, in Canada, ~90% of RBC units collected for transfusion are provided by [CONTACT_653736].[ADDRESS_877150]-time donors,7,8 its prevalence is even higher in the particularly altruistic frequent donors, especially among women of childbearing age.9,10 In the REDS-II Donor Iron Status Evaluation (RISE) study,11 up to 49% and 66% of male and female frequent donors, respectively, manifested either iron depletion (i.e., absent iron stores) or iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Similar frequencies of iron deficiency were also reported in Canadian,[ADDRESS_877151] both absent iron stores and the lack of sufficient iron for normal hemoglobin production. As iron deficiency progresses further, frank iron deficiency anemia develops with insufficient iron for maintaining adequate hemoglobin levels. Our target population is human donors with iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Adapted from Hastka et al.1 and Brittenham3.

In each study, the transfused iron-deficient RBCs had a decreased circulatory lifespan/recovery, most likely due to splenic clearance. In addition, when RBCs obtained from healthy donors were transfused into recipi[INVESTIGATOR_653718], the transfused RBCs had a normal lifespan, suggesting that the iron deficiency-induced defect was intrinsic to the RBC and not due to enhanced clearance mechanisms.33,[ADDRESS_877154] above from the 1940-70’s is no longer ethically permissible. Although the RBCs transfused in these studies were from donors with iron deficiency anemia, not from donors with iron-deficient erythropoiesis, deliberate allogeneic human transfusion studies using such donors and healthy volunteer recipi[INVESTIGATOR_653719]. Instead, we used a mouse model to obtain proof-of-principle preliminary data. Three mouse donor cohorts were prepared: iron replete, iron-
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	10	deficient erythropoiesis, and iron deficiency anemia (Fig. 3). Similar to our prior studies,[ADDRESS_877155]-transfusion recovery (mean 77.1%). In addition, as expected from other publications,16,29,[ADDRESS_877156]-transfusion recovery was poor using RBCs from donors with severe iron-deficiency anemia (mean 46.7%; p<0.001). In contrast, results using donors with iron-deficient erythropoiesis were subnormal (mean 66.5%; p<0.05) and would be less than the FDA-mandated minimum (in this mouse model). Taken together, these data support our hypothesis that, after refrigerated storage, RBCs from donors with iron-deficient erythropoiesis without anemia are suboptimal. 
	Figure 3. RBCs from iron-deficient donor mice have reduced 24-hour recovery and increased zinc protoporphyrin levels. Weanling male C57BL/6 mice were placed on a defined iron control diet of 45ppm iron (TD.110593, Harlan Laboratories) or an iron-deficient diet of 0-4ppm iron (TD.110592). A third group was fed the iron-deficient diet and was also phlebotomized weekly (50-100 μL per bleed) to generate a total of three groups of mice with varying iron status: (1) iron replete, (2) iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE) with mild iron deficiency, and (3) severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA).  At ~[ADDRESS_877157]-transfusion recovery was determined in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_653720] C promoter using flow cytometric detection of transfused RBCs (left panel).

Trial Enrollment  4.1 Screening/Recruitment The [LOCATION_001] Blood Center study staff will send a recruitment letter/email (see Appendix 1) to potential subjects who are 18-75 years old and frequent blood donors donating in the Manhattan catchment area. We will define frequent blood donors as (1): men who have donated the equivalent of at least 2, and women who have donated the equivalent of at least 1, RBC units in the past year.   Volunteers responding to the recruitment email will be screened for participation in the study by [CONTACT_61529] (see Appendix 7 for all screening forms) and then invited for a 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	13	screening meeting (P&S 14-434) to confirm eligibility and provide informed consent.  Screening day (P&S 14-434): All volunteers will be given the health questionnaire they would receive upon donation at the [LOCATION_001] Blood Center (see Appendix 7). All volunteers who decide to proceed with screening and sign consent will have four tubes of blood drawn to determine baseline laboratory values and to perform a blood type and antibody screen. If the baseline hematocrit is >38% (female) or >39% (male), ferritin < 15ng/mL, zinc protoporphyrin level is > 60 umol/mol heme, and C-reactive protein is <10mg/L (see inclusion/exclusion criteria above) then the volunteer will be scheduled for an autologous whole blood donation at the [LOCATION_001] Blood Center, and scheduled for an autologous 51-Chromium red cell recovery study 6 weeks after donation. At that time, neurocognitive assessments and emotional wellbeing will be performed as well (see Appendix 2-5 for surveys and section 5.4). Re-screening: Those subjects who meet the ferritin <15ng/mL and the zinc protoporphyrin > 60umol/mol heme criteria, but do not qualify due to a low hematocrit may be re-screened between 2 weeks to 3 months later. 4.2 Randomization Randomization will be performed using a computerized system with equal allocation (1:1) to iron repletion or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_547]; randomly permuted block sizes of 4, 6, or [ADDRESS_877159]-transfusion RBC recovery study (i.e., between Day #43-71; target is the day after the post-transfusion recovery study; performed on Harkness Pavillion 10). Volunteers will be admitted to the Columbia General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) (supported by [CONTACT_653739] (CTSA)). One peripheral intravenous line will be inserted and blood (2 tubes, 10mL) will be drawn for determining the 24-hour post-transfusion recovery. The subject will be randomized at this point. The randomization scheme will be created by a statistician unaffiliated with the study team and provided to the research pharmacy and DSMB prior to study initiation. The CUMC research pharmacy will be responsible for randomizing each subject to the appropriate treatment arm and will prepare either the iron treatment or saline placebo and provide it to the study team in a blinded 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.[ADDRESS_877160] arrives on the day of randomization and has a fever (T>100.4F) or feels ill, then the 24-hour post-transfusion recovery sample will be drawn, but randomization may be held until the subject feels better and reschedules. 4.[ADDRESS_877161] dose of the iron treatment/placebo and the treatment/placebo will be blinded. The test dose will be administered prior to giving the full dose to ensure safety of treatment. A research pharmacist will provide the placebo (IV saline) or treatment (IV low molecular weight iron-dextran or ferric carboxymaltose) and test dose of iron/placebo in a tinted infusion bag and tubing specifically designed to maintain blinding in clinical research studies (Medipak). A research nurse unaffiliated with the study team, from the Outpatient or Inpatient Center at the Columbia General Clinical Research Center (Harkness Pavillion 10th Floor), will be responsible for the test infusion and total dose iron infusion. With this design, volunteers and study investigators will be blinded to whether volunteers receive the active intervention or placebo. Subjects in both groups will receive similar discharge instructions as if they had received low molecular weight iron-dextran (see Appendix 6 for discharge instructions). Only the research pharmacist and the statistician on the DSMB will not be blinded. Scheduling and logistic communications with volunteers will be made by [CONTACT_9137], who will also be blinded to the treatment group. The research pharmacy will provide a standard 1-gram dose of low molecular weight iron-dextran, ferric carboxymaltose, or saline in special bags designed to conceal group assignment.  Situations may arise in which breaking the blind earlier would be in the best interest of the volunteer. In any situation in which a physician or the subject asks to be un-blinded to study treatment, a sealed copy of the randomization scheme for each subject will be kept in the investigator’s office and will be broken upon request. Furthermore, the research pharmacy can be reached on an emergency basis to provide this information. Finally, any un-blinding that occurs will be reported to the DSMB and ultimately reported in the resulting publication.

For calculating counts per minute per ml of RBC at time zero (T0), samples (two tubes, 10 mL) from the contralateral arm will also be obtained after 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, [ADDRESS_877167] 16 tubes or 80 mL of blood drawn overall (8 time points x 2 tubes x 5mL per tube = 80 mL). All blood draws will be performed from the peripheral intravenous line to avoid multiple needle sticks. Finally, because 30mL of blood will be infused and only 80mL of blood removed, this will leave the volunteer with a net loss of only 50mL of blood on the day of infusion. Following the 1-hour timed blood draw, the subject will be discharged.  5.3 Low Molecular Weight Iron Dextran (LMWID) or Ferric Carboxymaltose (INJECTAFER) Infusion Volunteers will be admitted to the Columbia General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) (supported by [CONTACT_653739] (CTSA) on Harkness Pavillion 10).

If low molecular weight iron dextran is unavailable due to shortages, the research pharmacist will provide ferric carboxymaltose instead. A research nurse unaffiliated with the study team, from the Outpatient or Inpatient Center at the Columbia General Clinical Research Center (Harkness Pavillion 10th Floor), will be responsible for the test infusion and total dose iron infusion. The research pharmacy will provide a standard 1-gram dose of low molecular weight iron-dextran, ferric carboxymaltose, or saline in special bags designed to conceal group assignment. In addition, the clinical pharmacy will provide Solumedrol 125 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.[ADDRESS_877169] dose (25 mg of LMWID or ferric carboxymaltose, 12.5 mL of the complete dose, infused over 20 minutes), patients will be observed for any side effects for 40 minutes (one hour from start of infusion); if no adverse effects are seen, then the entire dose diluted in 500 mL normal saline (i.e., 2 mg/mL of LMWID) will be infused over a period of 2 to 6 hours as tolerated (target 2 hours). If ferric carboxymaltose is used, the same test dose and the full [ADDRESS_877170] inquiry, and physical examination of each volunteer. Vital signs will be measured before, during (after 15 minutes and then hourly), and after each infusion. Resuscitation equipment and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions will be readily available during drug administration.  Recent studies support the convenience, safety, and efficacy of a single infusion of 1g of LMWID as therapy for iron deficiency in adults.41 The calculation for iron repletion using LMWID (from INFeD package insert) in adults is as follows: Dose (mL) = 0.0442 (Desired Hb - Observed Hb) x LBW + (0.26 x LBW)  Based on:  Desired Hb = the target Hb in g/dl. Observed Hb = the patient’s current hemoglobin in g/dl.  LBW = Lean body weight in kg.

    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	18	For females: LBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch of patient’s height over 5 feet To calculate a patient’s weight in kg when lbs are known: patient’s weight in pounds = weight in kilograms/2.2  Using this formula, the minimum dose that would be required to raise the hemoglobin by 2 g/dL would be ~800mg (minimum donation requirement is 110lbs = 50 kg) in a female and almost 900mg in a male. Thus, given that all subjects will be healthy volunteers with ferritin < 15 ng/mL with evidence of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and will be dosed following a whole blood donation for study purposes, [ADDRESS_877171] administration.    Neuropsychological tests will be administered to subjects on an iPad or Tablet.  Subjects will be supervised at all times during this portion of the evaluation and will be encouraged to complete the tests within one session (i.e. without interruption). Total time for test administration is approximately [ADDRESS_877172] containing printed copi[INVESTIGATOR_653722] (see appendices 4-7). The subject will be asked to complete the surveys on his/her own without interruption. The time of start and completion of the surveys will be recorded.  Neuropsychological tests included were selected based on the following criteria: All (1) meet high psychometric standards, (i.e. are reliable, valid, and well standardized); (2) have appropriate normative data; (3) maintain the lowest potential

The NIH Toolbox provides a standard set of royalty-free, comprehensive assessment tools that can be used by [CONTACT_653740] a variety of settings, with a particular emphasis on measuring outcomes in longitudinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_653723]. The battery has been normed and validated across the lifespan in subjects age 3-85 and its use ensures that assessment methods and results can be used for comparisons across existing and future studies. By [CONTACT_1541] a “common currency” for the study of neurological research, the NIH Toolbox enables economies of scale and enhances efficiency. The NIH Toolbox is capable of monitoring neurological and behavioral function over time, and measuring key constructs across developmental stages.

This will be followed 40-[ADDRESS_877174]-chromium infusion blood draw, the subjects will be randomized to iron infusion or placebo (Iron infusion1). Five months ± 4 weeks later, subjects will donate the second unit of autologous blood (Donation2). The second 51-Chromium post-transfusion recovery study will be performed 40-[ADDRESS_877175] be obtained before the blood bank issues the stored RBC unit and the radioactive 51-Cr-labeling can occur, we will provide subjects with the option of coming in up to 30 days prior to the scheduled PTR study to obtain a type and screen sample ([ADDRESS_877176] venipuncture). This will provide for a shorter day for the PTR study because there will no longer be the need to wait for the type and screen testing and the study can begin once the subject arrives. If a subject chooses not to provide this optional blood draw, a blood sample will be taken when the IV lines are placed for the PTR study and the PTR study will proceed after the blood bank issues the blood and it is radiolabeled per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799].

Compensation Subjects will be provided monetary compensation in cash for participation per visit. $20 will be provided for the screening. $10 will be provided for re-screening for those who meet criteria to be invited to be screened again. $80 will be provided for each donation and PTR study ($320 total). $80 will be provided for the iron/placebo infusion and for the final blood draw at the end of the study ($160 total). Finally, $40 will be provided for each of the optional blood draws. Thus, the maximum total compensation for subjects is $590 and the minimum compensation is $500 for completing the study. Subjects who dropout of the study prior to completion will keep any compensation received up to the dropout.  9. Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting  9.1 Definitions Adverse Event (AE) – Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  Grades were developed using the following guidelines: Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.  Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care ADL.  Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  Grade 5: Death related to AE.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – Any adverse event temporally associated with the subject’s participation in 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	25	research that meets any of the following criteria: results in death; is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurs); requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  Note that seriousness and severity are separate concepts. The term “severe” refers to the intensity of a specific event; a severe event may be of minor medical significance (e.g., a severe leg cramp). The term “serious” is based on outcome or action criteria that are usually associated with events that pose a threat to the patient’s life or functioning. An event that is mild in severity is serious if it leads to one of the outcomes defined above.  Grade 4 and 5 events will always be considered Serious Adverse Events. Many Grade 3 events and some Grade 1 and 2 events may meet the definition of a Serious Adverse Event.  Unexpected Adverse Event – Any adverse event occurring in one or more subjects in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either: the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the research that are described in (a) the protocol–related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol or the current IRB-approved informed consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.   Unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others (UP): Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: unexpected (in terms of nature, 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	26	severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related  Attribution – the determination of whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment procedure. Attribution categories: 1. Not Related - Event clearly related to other factors (e.g., clinical state, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; concomitant drugs) 2. Possibly Related - Sequence of event is compatible with study drug, device, or procedure, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1604] 3. Probably Related - Sequence of event is compatible with study drug, device, or procedure and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_138662] 4. Definitely Related - Sequence of event is compatible with study drug, device, or procedure and beyond doubt cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1604]  9.[ADDRESS_877179] definitions and monitoring protocols of adverse effects (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) will be developed with the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). An SAE defined as being one or more of the following: (i) life threatening, (ii) results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or (iii) causes irreversible, persistent, or significant disability/incapacity; these will be reported to regulatory agencies within [ADDRESS_877180] and Sponsor (NIH-NHLBI). Safety outcomes will be assessed at each study visit and with a follow-up phone call the day after each visit using a checklist of known adverse events and an open-ended question for volunteers to describe other adverse events. Participants will be encouraged to call the coordinator throughout the study if they experience 1) a new symptom, 2) change in severity of an existing symptom, 3) see a doctor/ER, 4) start a new medication. The most common serious acute adverse reaction of blood donation and insertions of intravenous lines is a vasovagal reaction, which may lead to loss of consciousness. Witnessed or un-witnessed vasovagal reactions will be considered as AEs, unless resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e.g., due to loss of consciousness causing 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	27	head trauma), in which case the event will be considered an SAE. Permanent or persistent peripheral arm nerve damage (in a phlebotomized arm) causing disability will be considered an SAE. Bruising and pain at the site of needle insertion that results in volunteer complaint at the follow-up phone call a day after phlebotomy will be considered an AE. Anaphylactoid reactions to iron infusions are usually evident within a few minutes, and close observation is necessary to ensure recognition. If at any time during the intravenous administration, any signs of a hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance are detected, administration will be stopped immediately. The reaction will be considered an SAE if it meets one of the criteria listed above. Furthermore, subjects will be called one day and one week after infusion to inquire about delayed side effects, such as myalgias, arthralgias, and gastrointestinal problems. Finally, iron deficiency is associated with fatigue, restless leg syndrome, decreased physical endurance and work capacity, and impaired concentration, attention, and other cognitive functions. Thus, subjects randomized to the placebo group may have AEs due to continued iron deficiency. These will be assessed using the validated Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the overall well-being SF-[ADDRESS_877181] meeting and

Statistical Considerations   11.[ADDRESS_877185]-transfusion RBC recovery from the initial study (under iron-deficient erythropoiesis conditions) and the subsequent study performed after randomization to iron repletion or placebo. A similar approach will be used to test the secondary objectives (i.e., the between-group difference in means of the within-subject change in fatigue score,36 self-reported health and wellbeing score,37 zinc protoporphyrin, hepcidin, soluble transferrin receptor, serum ferritin and hemoglobin concentration).  Furthermore, because we expect variable responses to iron repletion in the experimental group, and some crossover in the placebo group, we will also perform a secondary analysis to explore the effect of iron status on post-transfusion RBC recovery. We will use multiple regression to assess whether RBC zinc protoporphyrin level increases the R2 of a model of post-transfusion recovery predicted by [CONTACT_653744]. We will examine pre-specified demographic variables (gender [male/female], race [white/not white], age [<50/≥50 years]) to see if we can identify one or more that may be effect modifiers. These factors will be considered for inclusion in an adjusted model. The specific criteria for inclusion are: (i) difference by [CONTACT_653745] α = 0.10 two-sided, and (ii) related to outcome at level α = 0.[ADDRESS_877186] 80% power to detect a partial correlation coefficient increase of 0.33 for the unique contribution of RBC zinc protoporphyrin level.47      11.2 Sample Size Estimate Based on preliminary data from our prior 51Cr RBC recovery studies (IRB protocol #AAAI-0835), the standard deviation of the measure in our single site is 5.0%. Furthermore, the expected mean difference in post-transfusion RBC recovery 
 	
    Red blood cells from iron-deficient donors: recovery and storage quality Donor Iron Deficiency Study: Protocol version 2.5 CUMC IRB-AAAQ8875 	31	between iron replete mice and mice with iron-deficient erythropoiesis is 10.6%. If the difference were this large in humans, we would require <6 subjects (alpha = 0.05, two-sided, power = 0.80). However, we expect the difference to be less conspi[INVESTIGATOR_653728]. Thus, we power the study to detect a clinically relevant difference in post-transfusion recovery of 4%. Under this assumption, the calculated sample size required for each arm is 26 (alpha = 0.05, two-sided, power = 0.80). Furthermore, to allow for up to a 15% dropout rate (i.e., 4/26 subjects), we plan to randomize [ADDRESS_877187]-transfusion recovery study; thus, we predict up to 70 individuals will need to be recruited.   11.3 Interim Analyses Interim analyses will be performed twice (after every [ADDRESS_877188] completed study participation) in addition to the final analysis. The DSMB will conduct the analyses using a two-sided asymmetric Lan-DeMets alpha-spending approach with an O’Brien-Fleming two-sided symmetric stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_653729] = 0.05. The DSMB criteria for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_271056]: (i) the Z-score at interim analysis lies outside of the group sequential boundaries as calculated (Table 3); (ii) major safety violations; and (3) convincing evidence of futility in the context of AEs. Interim boundaries together with terminal criteria (z-scores and associated p-values) calculated using the WinLD version 2 program are provided in Table 3.  Table 3.

Title of study:  TAS -102 in C ombination with O xaliplatin  (TAS -OX) for Refractory 
Metastatic Colorectal C ancer.  
Study Phase: 1B /II 
Study Rationale:    
TAS -102 is an oral agent, which consists of a combination of a novel antimetabolite 5-
trifluorothymidine (FTD) and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) that prevents 
degradation of FTD.  It has demonstrate d activity in chemorefractory metastatic colorectal 
cancer ( mCRC)  patients.  In the Japanese randomized phase II trial, TAS -102 improved 
medial overall survival when compared to placebo (9.0 vs.6.6 months, HR 0.56) in subjects  
with mCRC refractory to 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), irinotecan and oxaliplatin .  Subsequently, a 
randomized phase III study conducted in 13 countries (RECOURSE trial) confirmed this benefit on overall survival when compared to placebo (7.1 months vs. 5.3 months, HR 0.68) in subjects  with r efractory metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) 5.   
 
Oxaliplatin is a third -generation platinum compound, which is active when used together 
with [ADDRESS_1271929] metastatectomy.  In the control arm of OPTIMOX1 study, oxaliplatin was reintroduced in 27% of subjects .  Alt hough patients 
derive clinical benefit when oxaliplatin is reintroduced, the response rates are not as robust as during initial exposures.  Decreased efficacy may be at least in part due to prolonged exposure and resultant resistance to 5- FU, which is a ba ckbone in maintenance and in 
oxaliplatin containing regimens.  Hence, we propose exploring the safety and efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with an alternative anti- metabolite TAS -102 (TAS -OX).   
 
TAS -[ADDRESS_1271930] progressed or 
recurred after FOLFOX, and who are candidates for additional oxaliplatin therapy.  
 
Methodology:    
This is  a 2-part clinical trial with TAS -[ADDRESS_1271931] part will 
be a dose -finding run- in phase. The second part will be a single arm expansion cohort study , 
which will further evaluate the safety, as well as efficacy, of TAS -OX in the treatment of 
mCRC.  Subjects  will be treated with the study drugs until radiological evidence of disease 
progression or until treatment discontinuation secondary to adverse events.

10(42) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.[ADDRESS_1271943] common cancer in the U nited States, and it accounts for 
approximately 9 % of all cancer deaths  1.  More than 100,000 new colon cancer cases were  
expected to be diagnosed in 2014, with about  20% of these cases  having metastatic disease at 
presentation  1,2.  Unfortunately, only a small number of patients with stage IV disease can be 
cured with multimodality therapy.  Hence, systemic medical therapy is essential in 
management of these patients.  Over the last two decades  a number of available systemic 
treatments for colon cancer have increased significantly.  They have improved both quality of life and overall survival, which now ex ceeds 2 years for stage IV disease 
3.  These treatments 
include  conventional chemotherapy agents ( fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan ), 
angiogenesis inhibitors (bevacizumab and aflibercept), multitarget oral tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (regorafenib) , and anti -EGFR antibodies (cetuximab and panitumumab).  The 
optimal sequence for the use of the available drugs is not clear.  It is the exposure to all of the 
active agents that seems to be more important than the o rder of administration.  Hence, the 
more lines of therapy we can offer to patients, the m ore benefit patients can derive in terms of 
their survival and quality of life.  Development of alternative/novel treatment options are essential for our ability to tr eat this disease more effectively.  
1.2 TAS -102  
 Mechanism of Action  
TAS -102 is a novel f unctional antitumor nucleoside.  It is a combined form of 1 M trifluridine 
(FTD; α,α,α-trifluorothymidine) and 0.5 M tipi[INVESTIGATOR_13071] (TPI) .  FTD is an 
antineoplastic antimetabolite  4.  It has at two different mechanism of actions.  It inhibits  
thymidylate synthase (TS) , and is also incorporated into DNA  4,5.  The latter mechanism is  
different from the primary cytotoxic mechanism of 5- fluorouracil ( 5-FU).  When FTD is taken 
orally it is largely degraded to an inactive form  by [CONTACT_906111] p hosphorylase (TP ).  This 
enzyme  is present in gastrointestinal tract, liver, and  tumor  tissue.  TPI [INVESTIGATOR_906098], 
and c o-administration of TPI [INVESTIGATOR_906099].  
TP has also been shown to play a role  in promoting angiogenesis  6.  Hence, TAS -[ADDRESS_1271944] 
been conducted in Japanese and Western populations .  These studies establish ed proof of 
concept, appropriate dosing , and preliminary safety  data for TAS -102.  As of 24 July 2014, 
1449 subjects  participated in Taiho sponsored TAS -102 trials globally.  Details regarding the 
early phase studies are included in the Investigat or’s Brochure for TAS -102. 
The efficacy and safety of TAS -[ADDRESS_1271945] been studied in 
a Phase 2 trial cond ucted in Japan and in a global Phase 3 trial (RECOURSE) conducted in 
the US, Europe, Australia and Japan.  In a randomized double -blind Japanese phase 2 trial  
169 subjects  with metastatic chemorefractory CRC were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to

11(42) either TAS -102 or placebo 7.  In this trial, subjects  in the TAS -102 group had significantly 
longer overall survival (OS) when compared to the placebo group (median OS 9.0 vs. 6.6 
months ; HR 0.56; p=0.0011).  Subsequent international randomized phase III study  
(RECOURSE trial) was  conducted in 13 countries .  Eight hundred patients with advanced 
refractory mCRC  were randomized 2:1 to TAS -102 or placebo.  The results of this trial 
confirmed TAS -102 associated benefit on overall survival observed in the  phase 2 Japanese 
trial.  Median OS in the TAS -102 group was 7.1 months versus 5.3 months in the  placebo 
group ( HR 0.68; p<0.0001)  7. In both of these studies, TAS -[ADDRESS_1271946]

 Rationale for Combining TAS -[ADDRESS_1271947] in part due to 
prolonged exposure and resultant  resistance to 5 -FU, which is part of the maintenance and 
oxaliplatin  and irinotecan  containing treatment regimens .  
 In this  trial, we propose exploring the safety and efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with 
an alternative anti-metabolite , TAS -102 (TAS -OX) in chemorefractory mCRC patients.  
FTD, an active antimetab olite in TAS -102, has mechanisms of cytotoxicity, which differs 
from [ADDRESS_1271948] rategy for a 
patient population with limited effective treatment options. If successful, this drug combination can be studied further in earlier setting s and in combination with biologics. 
 
 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
Based on current clinical experience with TAS -102, this drug is  well  tolerated when used as a 
single agent .  We suggest combining TAS -[ADDRESS_1271949] 2 
lines of therapy that included 5- FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan will be invited for  participation 
in this trial.  Although increased toxicities may be seen when the two drugs are combined, we anticipate that this drug combination will be tolerable and will provide additional efficacy in a patient population with limited treatment options.   If this study has promising results, future 
trials may also explore the use of this drug combination in earlier lines of therapy and in combination w ith biologics.

In both parts, t reatment will continue until radiological evidence of disease progression or 
development of unacceptable toxicities .    
3.2 Part 1  study design  
Treatments will be started at level 1 doses (Table 1), which are based on prior clinical experience with the medications studied.  Dose escalation will follow a traditional “3+3”

14(42) design.  Treatments will continue until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria 
or development of unacceptable toxicities.  
 
3 + 3 Design:  
• A minimum of 3 subjects  will be enrolled per dose level. 
• If none of the first 3 DLT -evaluable subjects  experience a DL T, dose escalation may 
proceed  to the next dose level . 
• If [ADDRESS_1271952] 3 DLT -evaluable subjects  in a cohort experiences a DLT, additiona l 
subjects  (up to a total of 6) w ill be enrolled in that cohort. 
• If fewer than one -third of DLT -evaluable subjects  in a cohort experience DLTs (e.g., 
DLTs in fewer than 1 of 3 or 2 of 6 subjects ), dose escalation may proceed.  
• If one -third or more of DLT -evaluable subjects (e.g., 2 or more of up to 6 DLT -
evaluable subjects ) in a cohort experience DLTs, the MTD will have been exceeded 
and dose escalation will cease. Up to 6 DLT -evaluable subjects will be evaluated for 
DLT at the preceding dose level.  
• The high est dose level at which fewer than 2 of 6 DLT -evaluable subjects experience 
DLTs will be declared the MTD.  
• All dose reductions will be permanent. 
 Treatment  Regimen   
Each treatment cycle will be 14 days long.  Oxaliplatin infusion  will be given on day  1 of each 
cycle .  TAS -102 will be taken twice daily on  days 1 -5 of each cycle.  All subjects will be 
started at dose level 1.  Doses will be escalated or de-escalated  as outlined in Table 1.

Dose -limiting toxicity  (DLT)  is defined as an adverse event (AE) during Cycle 1 that is 
possibly related to the study drug(s) , is clinically significant and/or unacceptable and is judged 
to be a DLT by [CONTACT_906112] l Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events

permanent.  
Definition of  DLTs:  
• Grade 4 neutropenia with ANC < 500/mm3 lasting longer than 3 days . 
• Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia with ANC < 1000/mm3 and temperature > 100.8° F . 
• Platelets < 25,000/mm3.  
• Grade 4 treatment related non -hematologic toxicities excluding alopecia  and 
neuropathy.   
• Delay of treatment for > [ADDRESS_1271953] clinical experience.  Oxaliplatin is typi[INVESTIGATOR_906100] a dose of 85 mg/m
2.  Since this is an approved dose for this 
combination, dose level 1 will start at this level for oxaliplatin.  Oxaliplatin dose may be deescalated as outlined in Table 1 depending on the development of DLTs.  
In the 
RECOURSE trial, TAS -102 was used at the  dose of 35 mg/m2 BID on  days 1 -5 and 8-12 every 4 
weeks. Because of concern for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_906101] m edications, 
TAS -102 will be started at 25 mg/m2 and escalated to goal dose level of 35 mg /m2 if no excess 
DLTs are observed  during the dose escalation “3+3” phase of the study.  Each cycle wi ll be [ADDRESS_1271954]  5-FU, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, bevacizumab (unless

[IP_ADDRESS] Food Intake  
Subjects  should take TAS -102 with a glass of water within 1 hour after completion of their 
morning and evening meals. 
 Oxaliplatin  
Oxaliplatin will be given as a c hemo infusion in 250 ml of 5% dextrose solution over [ADDRESS_1271965]’s baseline weight measu rement. Weight will 
be measured on Day 1 of each 2 -week treatment cycle. If there is a more than  10% change 
from the subject’s baseline weight measurement, the chemotherapy dose should be recalculated using the new weight.    
Supportive medications (e.g., a nti-emetics, hydration, antihistamines, corticosteroids) will be 
administered  according to institutional standards and the product package insert.

Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over -the-counter preparations 
used by a subject  from ≤ [ADDRESS_1271967] dose of study drug to the end of treatment 
visit.  All concomitant therapy, including  anesthetic agents, vitamins, homeopathic/herbal 
remedies, nutritional supplements, must be recorded during the screening and treatment period, starting from the date of signature [CONTACT_43998], and ending at the End of Treatment (EOT) visit. After the EOT visit, only concomitant therapy indicated for treatment of an AE has to be reported.

dosing, management and precautions should be observed. Subjects may contin ue the use of 
bisphosphonates for bone disease and corticosteroids for the symptomatic control of brain metastases provided the dose is stable before and during the study and they were started at least [ADDRESS_1271969] ’s notes and appropriate section of the eCRF . 
 Other c oncomitant treatment  
• The subject  can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids during the study as long as 
these were started at l east 4 weeks pri or to treatment.   
• Live virus and bacterial vaccines should not be administered whilst the subject  is 
receiving study medication and during the 28- day follow up period.   
• Caution is required when using drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g. , 
stavudine, zidovudine, telbivudine. Such drugs, if used concomitantly with TAS -102, 
may theoretically compete with the effector of TAS -102, i.e. , FTD, for activation via 
thymidine kinases. Therefore, when using antiviral drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the antiviral agent, and 
consider switching to an alternative antiviral agent that is not a human thymidine kinase substrate such as lamivudine, zalcitabine, didanosine, abacavir, etc.  
• Administration of  hematologic support  (e.g., blood transfusions, granulocyte colony -
stimulating factor [G -CSF], erythropoietin)  is allowed as medically indicated 
according to the institutional site standards.     
 Pregnancy and Contraception  
All subjects must be made fully aware of the information relating to the potential for  
reproductive toxicity as detailed in the Informed Consent Form.  Subjects of child bearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must agree to the use of two highly effective for ms of contraception throughout their participation in the study and for [ADDRESS_1271970] dose of study drug(s).  
Women of childbearing potential  
Females of childbearing potential should use reliable methods of contraception from  the time 
of screening unti l 4 weeks after  discontinuing study treatment. Acceptable methods of 
contraception include absti nence, tubal ligation, combined oral, transdermal or intra -vaginal 
hormonal cont raceptives, medroxyprogesterone injections (e.g. , Depo -provera), copper -

treatment administration  except myelosuppression which will be managed with dose 
modification . 
 Dosing Modification in Response to Hematologic Toxicities . 
For all subjects with decreases in neutrophils and/or platelets, the next cycle of study 
treatment should not be started until the resumption criteria are met : ANC ≥ 1,500/ mm3, the 
platelet count is ≥ 75,000/ mm3.   
For subjects who experience neutropenia or thr ombocytopenia , TAS -102 should be dose 
reduced as described in T ables 3 and 3a respectively .  If TAS -102 is already at 20 mg/m2, then 
oxaliplatin should be reduced by 1 dose level  (to 65 mg/m2), however the doses should not be 
reduced beyond this.  All dose reductions are permanent.  
Subjects who experience Grade ≥  3 neutropenia complicated by [CONTACT_906115]  ≥ [ADDRESS_1271978] practices , and should undergo a dose reduction 
as described in T ables 3 and 3a respectively in the next cycle .     
For subjects who experience grade 2 neutropenia uncomplicated by [CONTACT_906116] 14 days should be given a growth factor and dose reduced  as described in T able 3  
when ANC has recovered to 1,500/ mm3. Growth factors should be considered only if a 
subject’s ANC count has not recovered within 14 days of treatment being held.  
If hematological  abnormalities  do not recover  to the appropriate level  before the start of the 
next cycle, treatment re -initiation can be delayed until ANC recovery  for a maximum of 28 
days.  If treatment is held > 28 days  beyond the intended start of the next cycle (6 weeks from 
prior dose)  due to a ny reason, the subject  must be removed from protocol treatment.

In the absence of significant treatment delays due to adverse events determined  to be possibly, 
probably, or definitely attributed to a study agent (as defined in Section 9.1),  treatment may  
continue indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies: 
• Objective disease progression according to RECIST criteria. Under some 
circumstances subjects may continue to receive study treatment after radiographic 
progression per RECIST 1.1 as long as they continue to experience clinical benefit in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021].   
• Intercurrent illness that prevents furt her administration of treatment.  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s) . 
• Severe non -compliance to study protocol as judged by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator . 
• Subject  becomes pregnant . 
• Subject  is determined to be incorrectly enrolled (i.e., the subject does not meet the 
required inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study) . 
• Subject  decides to withdraw from the study (the subject is at any time free t o 
discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment) . 
• General or specific changes in the subject 's condition. 
• Treatment delay for any reason > 28 days from planned date of treatment.

2. PET- CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a PET -
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality  for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of 
a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT, then the CT portion 
of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT. 
3. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.  
4. Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -
measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108] , simple cysts.  
5. If a target lesion becomes very small some radiologists indicate that it is too small to measure.  If the lesion is actually still present, a default measurement of 0.[ADDRESS_1271989] believes the lesion has gone, a default 
measurement of 0.0 cm should be recorded.  
 Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representat ive of all involved organs, should be identified as target  lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all  involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible  repeated measurements.  A sum of the diameters (longest 
for non- nodal lesions, short  axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated.  If 
lymph nodes are to be  included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The 
baseline sum  diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor  
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.

 Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases u nequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
8.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in m etric notation using a ruler or calipers. 
All baseline evaluations should be performe d as cl osely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 we eks before the beginning of the treatment. The same 
method of assessment and the s ame technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and durin g follow -up. 
 
1. Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
2. Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
3. Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1271990] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans).  
 
8.3 Response Criteria  
 Evaluation of target lesions  
Complete Response 
(CR):  Disappearance of all targets extra nodal lesions and the regression 
of all nodal lesions to < 10 mm SAD. 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters

31(42) Progressive Disease 
(PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is considered progression. 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of 
diameters while on study.  
 
 Evaluation of non -target lesions  
Complete Response 
(CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (< 
10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease 
(PD):  Unequivocal progression  of existing non- target lesions and/or 
appearance of one or more new lesions *

 Progression free survival  
Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of first documented progression or any cause of death during the study.  Progression will be assessed by a CT scan according to RECIST criteria version [ADDRESS_1271991] follow -up with clinically stable disease.  
This includes subjects who withdraw consent.  
 
 Response rate  
Response  rate is defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) by [CONTACT_906117], version 1.1.  A maximum of 5 measurable lesions in total (and up to 2 per organ) representati ve of all 
involved organs should be identified as target lesions at baseline and measured through the course of study treatment.  Target lesions should be selected based on their size and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements.  At baseline, the sum of the diameters (longest diameters (LD) for extra nodal target lesions and short axis diameters (SAD) for nodal lesions) will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  This baseline sum LD will be used as the reference by [CONTACT_14218].  All other lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout the s tudy. 
9. STUDY SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153188].  
9.[ADDRESS_1271992].  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms ( e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs ( e.g. tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g.  laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. The term AE is 
used to include both serious and non- serious AEs.

 Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i .e., screening, run -in, 
treatment, wash -out, follow -up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfi lls one or more of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906104]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardi ze the subject  or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
• The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to Taiho Pharmacovigilance Operations or designee.  
9.[ADDRESS_1271993] dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs , they must be reported to the  Yale 
Data S afety M onitoring Committee (DSMC)  and Yale University  Human Investigation 
Committee ( HIC) as per SOPs .).   AEs will be recorded per Yale Cancer Center ( YCC ) SOPs.  
 All study -related toxicities/ SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless in the  Treating 
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the subject’s underlying disease.  
 
 Adverse Events based on signs and symptoms  
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (whe n possible) to r ecording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  Howeve r, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately.

Study Code HIC# [PHONE_18790]  
Version Number: 6.0  
Date: 20-May-2020  
34(42) 
 Adverse Events based on examinations and tests  
Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory values and vital signs 
should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product.  
If dete rioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible , the r eporting investigator 
will use  the clinical, rath er than the laboratory term (e.g.  anemia versus low hemoglobin 
value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s ). 
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.  Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical 
finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline asses sment will be reported 
as an AE.  
 Disease progression  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of  the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The 
development of new or progression of existing metastasis during the study should be 
considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study . 
 New cancers  
The development of a new primary cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at least one of the serious criteria (see Section 9.1.2).  New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have 
developed after the i nclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include metastases of 
the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as 
an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease progression.  
 Lack of efficacy  
When there is deterioration in the condition for which the study treatment(s) is being used, 
there may be uncertainty as to whether this is lack of efficacy or an AE.  In such cases, unless 
the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_906105], or local regulations state to the contrary, the deterioration 
should be considered to be a lack of efficacy and not an AE. 
 Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol -defined 28- day p ost-study 
follow -up period after the administration of the last dose of st udy treatment, must be reported

protocol will be reported.  
Non-serious adverse events and SAEs will be collected from the time consent is given, 
throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 28- day follow -up period.  After 
withdrawal from treatment, subjects must be followed -up for all existing and new AEs for [ADDRESS_1271997] dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution.  All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs, then they must be reported to the 
FDA  as per their reporting criteria ).  All study -related toxicities/ SAEs must be followed until

 Laboratory safety assessment  
Full hematology assessments for safety should be performed during every visit and when 
clinically indicated.  This should include hemoglobin, platelets, mean cell volume (MCV) , 
white blood cells (WBC) , absolute differential white cell count (neutrophils, ly mphocytes, 
monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) .  If absolute differentials are not available, % 
differentials will be provided.  
Coagulation profile (activat ed partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT) and international 
normali zed ratio (INR) will be performed at baseline and if clinically indicated .  
Biochemistry assessments for safety (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, glucose, 
creatinine, total biliru bin, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), aspartate transaminase (AST), 
alanine transaminase (ALT) , urea or b lood urea n itrogen (BUN), total protein, and al bumin 
should be performed at every visit or more frequently as clinically indicated.    
These tests will be performed by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s local laboratory.  Additional analyses may be performed if clinically indi cated.   Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
should be repeated as clinically indicated and recorded on the eCRF.  
 Physical examination  
Complete physical exam will be performed before trial enrollment and during each treatment 
visit.  
 Vital  signs  
Vital signs will be obtained at every clinic visit.  Vital signs will include temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], oxygenation, and weight.  Height will be measured at the time of study enrollment.  Significant abnormalities will be recorded a s an AE.  B lood pressure and pulse 
rate will be measured using  automated BP measuring devise.  Body temperature will be 
measured in degrees Fahrenheit using an automated thermometer .   
 ECG  
Baseline resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the time of study  enrollment.  Repeat ECG 
will be performed when clinically indicated during the course of the treatment . 
ECGs will be recorded at 25 mm/sec.  All ECGs should be assessed by [CONTACT_906118] / not clinically 
significantly abnormal.  If there is a clinically significant abnormal finding, the Investigator 
will record it as an AE on the eCRF.  The original ECG traces must be stored in the patient medical record as source data.

consisting of all required observations, AEs, and laboratory data will be entered into a 
computerized database in a timely manner . The accuracy and completeness of the database, 
timely submission of SAEs and compliance with the protocol, is assured by [CONTACT_906120]’s  Yale Data and Saf ety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) C ommittee.  
The Yale Cancer Center (YCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will provide the primary oversight of data and safety monitoring. The Yale DSMC will review and monitor 
compliance, toxicity and deviations from this study. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. 
Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the 
Principal Investigator.  
The DSMC will review this p rotocol bi -annually, at a minimum. Information to be provided to 
the committee includes: a study narrative by [CONTACT_978], a summary DSMC report produced by [CONTACT_45825] (which includes participant accrual, response, trial status history, SAEs, adverse events, deviat ions and survival); audit results, and monitoring reports, as applicable. Other 
information (e.g., scans, laboratory values, etc.) will be provided upon request. Upon completing the review, the DSMC will approve whether the study should continue as planned, require modification/ amendment, or be placed on administrative hold with accrual temporarily suspended.  
Trials being monitored by [CONTACT_45826] a DSMC review has occurred that includes the research activity of  the last subject who 
completed the intervention, or until the DSMC feels there are no patient safety concerns that require further monitoring. The DSMC will determine the length of continued DSMC review.  
The DSMC has authority to intervene in the conduct of these studies as necessary to ensure 
the safety of the participants and to maintain the highest quality in the clinical research 
performed at YCC. The DSMC has the authority to require additional monitoring and/ or more frequent reporting on study progr ess and serious adverse events.   
On a regular interval basis, s tatus reports of all laboratory parameters, AEs and SAEs are 
reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_906107]. Regular  Weekly  Disease Aligned 
Research Team meetings will be  held to discuss ongoing subject treatment and adverse events.  
The Princip al Investigator will distribute manufacturer  provided safety reports  and updated 
Toxicity Lists to Yale Universi ty HIC and all relevant personnel involved in the conduct of 
the study  as per t heir policy ( Yale University HRPP Policy 710) . The To xicity List, in

 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1. Purpose  
The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the impact of a behavioral support intervention for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who are starting on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This trial compares adults with T1D who a re starting on CGM with behavioral supports (the intervention group) 
versus those who are starting on CGM without behavioral supports (the control group). We will examine group differences over a [ADDRESS_804269] set of out comes includes glycemic 
variables (e.g. hemoglobin A1c, time in range). In this set of outcomes, A1c is the identified primary endpoint. The second set of outcomes includes psychosocial variables (e.g. diabetes distress, worry about hypoglycemia, technolog y attitudes), with diabetes distress as the primary endpoint. After the initial comparison 
of intervention to control across the first [ADDRESS_804270] a longitudinal follow -up 
of glycemic and psychosocial outcomes at 6 and 12 m onths.  
 1.2. Background  
1.2.1. Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a burdensome chronic disease; many adults with T1D do not meet treatment 
targets.  The Centers for Disease Control and JDRF data estimate that there are over 1 million adults in the US 
with T1D (1, 2) ; 15,[ADDRESS_804271] T1D (1). T1D requires constant attention to glucose levels, food intake and physical 
activity, and insulin dosing decisions. Giving too much  or too little insulin could result in hypo-  or 
hyperglycemia, both of which carry risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_109916]- term complications. National data show that the 
majority of adults do not meet ADA’s recommended glycemic target  of A1c<7.0% (86% of adults 18 -25; 70% of 
adults over 25) (5). Adults with T1D are well -positioned to benefit from behavioral interventions that are tailored 
for their unique needs and integrated into clinical care.  
1.2.2. Existing and emerging diabetes technologies can dramati cally improve health and reduce burden, but 
adoption rates are low. Diabetes technology offers major advances in diabetes management that reduce self -
management burden and improve health outcomes and quality of life for individuals with T1D (6-8). These 
devices include continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and insulin pumps. CGM technology provides 
in-the-moment information about glucose levels, including direction and speed of change. CGM reduces 
management burden by [CONTACT_607067]. CGM  has been shown to be cost -effective 
(9) and to help adults improve both glycemic control and time spent in target glucose range without increasing 
risk of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_607049] (10-12). Furthermore, i mprovements in CGM accuracy 
have enabled the crucial next step toward automating diabetes management  with closed loop systems . Closed 
loop systems have shown the ability to reduce hypoglycemia and glucose variability and increase time in range (16-20). In addition, these systems decrease the mental burden of living with T1D (21-23). To experience the 
benefits of current and future diabetes technologies adults with T1D must be willing to wear and maintain a CGM and insulin pump over t ime. We know that currently, more than half (~62%) of individuals with T1D use 
insulin pumps in the US (5), while only 14% of adults with T1D currently use CGM. Further, a concerning 
proportion of adults (27%) quit CGM within the first year du e to the daily burden of using the device (24) . 
Providing adults with T1D  with the resources and tools to work through modifiable barriers could lead to 
continued CGM use and increased readiness for closed loop.   
1.2.3. T here is no official standard of care for CGM initiation.  
Table 1 presents CGM recommendations from ADA’s 2018 
Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (42). ADA 
recommends that adults receiv e robust  education, training, 
and support for CGM use (42); this recommendation comes 
from expert consensus and clinical experienc e. There is a 
need to develop high- quality, evidence -based behavioral 
interventions to provide recommended training and support. If adults with T1D receive comprehensive 
education and support alongside CGM initiation, they may be more likely to use the devices and to experience 
short-  and long- term health and quality of life benefits . Given that CGM is becoming part of “usual care”  for Table 1 . ADA 2018 Recommendations for CGM  
Current reco mmendation              State of the science

[ADDRESS_804272] interventions that 
provide addit ional resources and support for CGM uptake versus CGM alone.  
1.2.4. The need for guided diabetes device ‘onboarding’.  To address the need for increased support for 
initiating diabetes devices, the overall objective of the proposed study is to provide adul ts with T1D with a 
tailored behavioral intervention using evidence -based strategies and tools to enable them to maximize benefit 
from CGM and increase readiness for closed -loop technology. According to the widely used Technology 
Acceptance Model (44), factor s such as the technology’s perceived usefulness and ease of use influence 
likelihood of using and benefitting from the technology. Therefore, our ONBOARD ( Overcomi ng Barriers & 
Obstacles to Adopting Diabetes Devices ) intervention package will prepare adult s with T1D to use and benefit 
from CGM by 1) setting realistic expectations for the technology; 2) providing resources and problem -solving 
skills to work through barriers ; 3) helpi[INVESTIGATOR_607050] ; and 4) planning for potential 
issues that may arise in the future to prevent CGM discontinuation. This study addresses a major gap in the 
literature on what guidance and support adults with T1D need, beyond education, to benefit from advances in 
diabetes devices and to increase their readiness to adopt new diabetes technologies.  
 
1.3. Preliminary Studies 
The preliminary work described here focused on identifying modifiable barriers to diabetes device use, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_607051], and highlig hting links between intervention targets and important diabetes 
outcomes.  
1.3.1. We found that non -users of CGM are 
younger, have higher A1c values, and more 
negative attitudes toward diabetes technology 
compared to CGM -users.  Through an online survey 
of participants in the T1D Exchange Clinic Network, 
we collected data from 1,503 adults with T1D 
regarding their current device use and major 
barriers to using diabetes devices (54.7% women; 
mean age= 35.3±14.8 years; mean diabetes 
duration=20.4±12.5  years ; 70% using insulin 
pumps; 37% using CGM). On average, non -users of CGM were 5 years younger; had higher A1c values (.37% 
higher mean A1c); and reported more barriers to device use compared to CGM users (22) .  
1.3.2. Physical, data, social, and trust barriers interfer e with CGM use.  In the same survey, barriers to using 
diabetes devices (CGM and insulin pump) fell into several categories: 1) hassle/ burden of wearing devices on 
the body; 2) nervous to rely on the technology; 3) time burden of managing diabetes; and 4) devices drawing 
unwanted attention from others (Table 1). We conducted a follow -up survey of adults who had discontinued 
using diabetes devices to learn their reasons for discontinuation (Table 2). Rates of CGM discontinuation are 
considerably higher than pump discontinuation (5). After cost, issues with alarms, accuracy, discomfort and 
pain led to CGM discontinuation. Our  preliminary data highlight why many adults with T1D feel the negatives 
outweigh positives of CGM and stop using this beneficial technology. 
Survey data strongly support  the ADA recommendation for robust 
support tailored to the commonly endorsed  barriers to using CGM  to 
promote increased uptake and sustained use of CGM and, eventually, closed loop systems.  
1.3.3. Closed loop systems depend on CGM accuracy to gain user 
trust. Closed loop systems require wearing a CGM and an insulin 
pump and partially automate insulin delivery. Given the novelty of closed loop systems, we aimed to understand major factors that 
could influence willingness to trust and accept the potential risks o f 
closed loop. I applied my expertise in qualitative research methods to analyze focus groups with participants in 
a closed loop system trial (n=32). Results showed that user expectations and trust shaped overall satisfaction 
with the system and likelihood  of continued use. Specifically, overly high/unrealistic expectations contributed to 
increased negative evaluations of the system (3). Issues with CGM accuracy and intrusiveness of alerts hurt 

 
[ADDRESS_804273] and decreased the likelihood that someone would opt to continue using the system (24). Relatedly, 
our extensive interviews with adults with T1D (n=113) highlighted that CGM accuracy was a major priority 
when considering closed loop system adoption (45), since accuracy of CGM determines the system’s ability to 
improve glycemic control . Our results highlight additional potential barriers and intervention targets to promote 
adoption and sustained use of CGM, and to increase readiness fo r using closed loop systems. Results  
demonstrate the investigator’s strong ability to conduct qualitative research related to T1D experience.  
1.3.4. Interventions with problem -solving, motivational interviewing, and social learning components can 
improve psychosocial and health outcomes in adolescents and adults with diabetes . Multicomponent 
interventions are advantageous because they capi[INVESTIGATOR_607052], evidence -based 
interventions (46, 47) . Multicomponent interventions that include motivational in terviewing, problem- solving, 
and cognitive behavioral therapy have demonstrated ability to improve A1c in T1D (48-50). Extensive evidence 
supports the benefit of problem -solving interventions for diabetes management (51-57). Mot ivational 
interviewing has also proven to be effective in promoting positive behavior change in diabetes management 
(58-60). Finally, successful programs to improve psychosocial and health outcomes often inco rporate a social 
component, whether through group delivery (61), an online forum (63), or involvement of a peer coach (64-68). 
While these strategies can be beneficial, another powerful tool, informed by [CONTACT_287352] (69), is to 
incorporate videos of first -person stories that model how individuals worked through relevant problems (70, 
71). For example,  YourWay, an Internet -based, social learning and problem -solving program , helped 
adolescents wi th T1D work through psychosocial barriers to diabetes self -management (63). Through digital 
storytelling, YourWay presented participants with first -person “stories” of diabetes problem -solving, which can 
help individuals develop probl em-solving skills and self- efficacy through “vicarious learning” (72, 73) .

CHAPTER 2: STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
2.1. Synopsis of study protocol  
 
The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the impact of a behavioral support intervention for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who are starting on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). 
This trial compares adults with T1D who a re starting on CGM with behavioral supports (the intervention group) 
versus those who are starting on CGM without behavioral supports (the control group). We will examine group 
differences over a [ADDRESS_804274] set of out comes includes glycemic 
variables (e.g. hemoglobin A1c, time in range). In this set of outcomes, A1c is the identified primary endpoint. 
The second set of outcomes includes psychosocial variables (e.g. diabetes distress, worry about 
hypoglycemia, technolog y attitudes), with diabetes distress as the primary endpoint. After the initial comparison 
of intervention to control across the first [ADDRESS_804275] University through a combination of in -clinic, in community locations 
and online through type 1 diabetes online communities. Eligible participants will be adults (ages 18 -50) who 
have not been using CGM consistently (>5 days/week) for at least the past [ADDRESS_804276] in the study, study staff will 
approach potential participants to explain the study, determine 
eligibility, and obtain informed consent. All participants will complete 
their baseline visit remotely. This baseline visit will include 1) 
completing a hemoglobin A1c test kit that is mailed to them in advance; 2) completing a baseline assessment survey online via a 
secure site (REDCap) to obtain demographic and psychosocial data  
and 3) initiate use of CGM supplies. Participants will be given the choice of using Dexcom G6 or Libre [ADDRESS_804277] resources from the device 
manufacturer at this baseline visit. At baseline, participants will then be randomized. We will randomize at a 1:1 ratio, intervention to 
control. Those  randomized to the intervention ( ONBOARD ) condition 
will schedule [ADDRESS_804278] (every 
2 weeks) , with the first session scheduled for 2 weeks after CGM 
initiation.  Sessions will be conducted via a secure, HIPAA -compliant, 
videoconferencing software (Zoom) and may be recorded to ensure 
consistency and quality of the intervention across participants  and 
interventionists . Each participant will receive one unique Zoom link 
that they will use for a ll [ADDRESS_804279] kits for 
follow -up A1cs, and will complete a follow- up REDCap survey at 
these time points as well. The follow -up survey will assess 
psychosocial var iables, technology satisfaction, and changes to 
demographic/medical information. Each follow -up survey is expected 
to take [ADDRESS_804280] 12 weeks of the study. At the 3 -, 6-, and 12 -month timepoints, CGM data downloads  will be obtained.   
 
2.3. Study groups  
 
There are two groups in this study: intervention (ONBOARD) and control (CGM -only). All participants will

data quantity, change arrows, and alarms, and then will learn to examine data for patterns and trends. Study 
personnel will not directly suggest insulin dosing  and may encourage participants to talk with their care team 
when relevant . ONBOARD sessions will be delivered individually  to participants by a doctoral level Table 3. ONBOARD Intervention Topic  Content

2.6.1. Eligibility criteria  
 
To be eligible for the study, an adult must meet the following criteria:  
 
1. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes  
2. Age between 18 and 50 years  at time of screening  
3. Comprehension of written and spoken English 
4. Lack of consistent continuous glucose monitoring use (>5 days/week) for past 6 months  
5. No severe medical conditions, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_607056] 
 2.6.2. Exclusion criteri a 
 The presence of any of the following is an exclusion for the study:  
1. Subject has a medical disorder that in the judgment of the investigator will interfere with completion of 
any aspect of the protocol (e.g. pregnancy, kidney disease, skin condition that  may hinder sensor 
application).  
2. Subject has a neurologic disorder that in the judgment of the investigator will affect completion of the 
protocol.  
 2.7. Data analysis plan  
Our team has extensive experience in the use of web -based assessment, data management and data 
anlysis. Quantitative data will be entered into an online encrypted, HIPAA- compliant data management system, 
REDCap, with secure access for unique study IDs assi gned to each participant. REDCap survey data is then 
ready for download by [CONTACT_607069]. CGM data will 
be downloaded via Dexcom Clarity and LibreView which create a CSV file for transfer to REDCa p and data 
analysis programs.  
Demographic, medical, psychosocial variables, and some outcome measures are surveys and multi -
item scales that participants will answer in REDCap. Psychometric properties of scales will be assessed before 
proceeding to invest igate the proposed aims. These psychometric properties include item -total correlations and 
Cronbach’s α to assess reliability. Total scores and subscale scores, when available, will be calculated and 
used for statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics wi ll calculate frequencies, means and standard deviations for 
study variables. Independent samples t -tests and c
2 analyses will assess potential differences between groups 
at baseline in demographic, psychosocial and diabetes variables. Analyses for Hypothes es 1&[ADDRESS_804287] Hypotheses 1&2, we will first conduct a treatment group comparison (ONBOARD vs. CGM -only)

(Hypothesis 1), diabetes distress, a nd perceived CGM benefit (Hypothesis 2). We will reference information 
criteria (e.g., Akaike’s) to inform model selection decisions. Beyond testing the groups -by-time interaction term, 
custom contrasts will assess group differences at each time point. Exploratory analyses will examine 
differences between subgroups over time after primary, intent -to-treat analyses  are completed. Additional 
exploratory analyses will examine patient -level predictors of CGM wear (e.g. age, gender, diabetes duration). 
For the C GM-continuer subgroup, we will conduct exploratory longitudinal analyses using CGM data to look at 
changes in time in range. W e will adjust  for multiple comparisons by [CONTACT_607071] -Hochberg procedure 
and a false discovery rate of 0.05  (78). Analyses will initially be conducted without imputation for missing 
values, using the missing -at-random approach (79) and then multiple imputation will be used to supply values 
for missing data. We will conduct sensitivity analysis by [CONTACT_607072]. 
Enrolling  and randomizing a sample of 1 78 adults with T1D (1:1 randomization; 89  per arm) will  be 
sufficient to  investigat e the hypotheses in this study.  Based on our previous relat ed work, we estimate 15% 
attrition, yielding a final sample size of 76 participants per arm (152 total). This target sample size is based on 
the following pi[INVESTIGATOR_607057]. First, e ffect sizes comparing CGM to non -use in adults with T1D  are in the 
moderate (d=.40- .50) range (8, 75, 76) , showing improvements in A1c and time in range during CGM use.  
Further, standardized effects of diabetes behavioral interventions for adults are in the small to moderate range 
with .35 to .40 SD unit differences (43, 77) . In the proposed study , we hypothesize group differences in A1c of 
a similar or greater magnitude will be driven by a c ombination of greater sustained use of CGM over the [ADDRESS_804290] and CGM- only are based on i ntent -

between the [ADDRESS_804291]  and 89 to CGM -only will provide power to exceed 0. 80 for the primary outcome of A1c for 
moderate effects of d=.35 or greater . The  sample size allows detectable mean differences in the  magnitude of 
A1c≥0. 5% (conservatively assuming 1.2 SD ; recent registry data suggests our SD will be closer to 1.0) . A 0.5% 
A1c is the minimum clinically significant difference regarded by [CONTACT_607073]. Treatment 
guidelines and algorithms from ADA/EASD and [LOCATION_006] National Institute for Clinical Excellence have 
recommended evaluating new treatment regimens by [CONTACT_84195] A1c is lowered by 0.5% or more . Between clinic 
and wider T1D community, we will have ample ability  to re ach our recruitment goal.

 CHAPTER 3: ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
3.1. Overview of Safety Monitoring  
 
Safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_6283]. Tanenbaum (PI) and Hood  (Mentor) on an ongoing basis. Safety 
data will be gathered and reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_30967]. Reviews will occur every two 
months during the course of the trial and the study staff will examine occurrence of adverse events and 
whether participants are satisfied with their participation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_607058]/benefit ratio of the stu dy and whether 
modifications to the protocol and consent forms are required. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_607059]. Unanticipated probl ems to be assessed include adverse events, deviations from the study protocol, 
problems with informed consent, and confidentiality violations. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_607060] [ADDRESS_804292] (DSMB) . 
 
3.2. Definition of an Adverse Event  
 
Reportable adverse events in this study include any untoward medical occurrence that meets criteria for a 
serious adverse event or any medical occurrence (expected or unexpected) in a study participant that is study -
related.  
 
Hypoglycemic events are recorded as adverse events if the event required assistance of another person due to 
altered consciousness and required another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or ot her 
resuscitative actions. This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable 
to treat his or herself, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, 
or experienced seizure or coma. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982]. If plasma glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological 
recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is co nsidered sufficient evidence that the 
event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.   
 
Hyperglycemic events are recorded as adverse events if the event involved diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as 
defined by [CONTACT_333054], and had all of the following:  
 
× Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting;  
× Serum ketones > 1.0 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones;  
× Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15; and  
× Treatment provided in a health care facility  
Skin irritation from sensor wear will be recorded in specific sections of the case report forms. An adverse event 
form is only completed if skin irritation is severe.  
 
Distress or discomfort experienced by [CONTACT_607074]. However, we have trained psychologists on staff who will be available to address any distress or discomfort and initiate referrals if requested.  
 3.2. Recording of adverse events  
 
Throughout the course of this study, all efforts wi ll be made to remain alert to possible adverse events or 
untoward findings. The first concern will be the safety of the participant, and appropriate medical intervention 
will be made.  
 
[ADDRESS_804293] been caused by [CONTACT_6078].  
 
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three -point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) severe.  It is 
emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus a severe adverse event is not nec essarily 
serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.   
 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study will be followed 
until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the condition is expected.  
 
3.3. Reporting serious or unexpected device -related adverse events  
 
A serious adverse event is any untoward occurrence that:  
- Results in death  
- Is life -threatening; (a non life -threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 
become life- threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event)  
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
- Results in significant disability/incapacity  
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
3.4. Unanticipated adverse device event   
 
An unanticipated adverse device event is defined as an adverse event caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect or probl em was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence.  
 
Serious or unexpected adverse events must be reported to the coordinating center immediately via completion 
of the online serious adverse event form.

3.5. Potential risks and side effects  
 
Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk  and is protected by [CONTACT_338697]. Hypoglycemia, 
hyperglycemia, and ketone formation are always a risk in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Subjects will be closely 
monitore d for this. When wearing CGM sensors there are risks of skin rashes,  allergic reactions to tape, 
infections at the insertion site, or small pi[INVESTIGATOR_607063]. These 
risks will be monitored, but study staff will not oversee insertions, tracking of sensor information, and other 
diabetes device information.  
 3.5.1. Hypoglycemia 
 
There is always a risk of hypoglycemia for patients with insulin -dependent diabetes. The frequency of 
hypoglycemia during this study is not expected to be greater than the risk incurred during daily living. If severe 
hypoglycemia occurs, it is readily treated with either oral glucose or glucagon injection. To minimize the risk of 
hypoglycemia due to “stacking” insulin doses, study participants will be instructed in their initial education not to 
take rapid act ing insulin injections to correct hyperglycemia more than once every 3 hours. The low alert level 
 
12 
 will be set at 75 mg/dL for all study participants at the outset of the study; however, participants can change 
these alerts if they would like.  
 
3.5.2. Hyperglycemia  
 
Hyperglycemia and ketonemia can occur if insulin delivery is attenuated or suspended for an extended period. 
This is a risk of type [ADDRESS_804294] for several weeks. The risk of local infection is less than 1 in 1000.  
 3.5.4. Sensor site risks  
 
There is a possibility of CGM sensor site risk. Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an 
infection. CGM sensors are inserted under the skin. There may be bleeding where the sensor is inserted, 
which can cause bruising. CGM site infections  occur very infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral 
and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_27996]. The risk of skin problems could be greater if a sensor is left in longer than recommended. On rare occasions, the sensor wire may break or detach from  the sensor pod. There is a 
remote chance that sensor fragments could remain under the skin if the sensor breaks during normal wear. 
Subjects may also develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure the CGM. If 
these reactions  occur, different adhesives (such as with IV 3000, Tegaderm, etc.) will be tried, sites will be 
rotated frequently, and a mild topi[INVESTIGATOR_27995]. All participants will be 
carefully instructed about proper use of sens ors.  
 3.5.5. Other potential risks  
 
A potential source of risk in this study is the risk of gathering sensitive social, behavioral, and medical 
information. Data collection via the internet will be conducted throu gh secure applications (REDCap) . There 
are no known psychological risks to subjects completing self -report attitude and behavior rating scales . or 
participating in intervention sessions. However, the survey and intervention topi[INVESTIGATOR_607064]/emotions. Subjects will be informed that any items on questionnaires or topi[INVESTIGATOR_607065]. Sub jects will also have the 
option of not participating in conversations or exercises in the interventions that cause them discomfort. They 
will also be free to withdraw at any time. All intervention modules will be carried out by a highly trained, 
doctorate level psychologist. There are no known risks to audio recording intervention sessions. All audio 
recorded information will remain confidential and will only be accessed by [CONTACT_607076]. Use of BG 
meter downloads offers no increased risk over standard care. Data downloaded from CGM and the home 
glucose meter will be collected for the study as measures of diabetes self -management behaviors. Some 
people may be uncomfortable with the researchers' having such detailed information about their daily diabetes habits. The respondent burden for completion of all data collection at each assessment point is approximately 
30-[ADDRESS_804295] screening for eligibility and enter this information in to the 
secure server (REDCap). Eligible adults who are interested in participating will be provided with an informed 
consent form and HIPAA waiver, either electronically or hard copy. The study team member will then explain 
the purposes, benefits and risks  of the project and offer them an opportunity to ask questions and/or decline 
participation. If still interested in participating, a full description of the nature of the study, the requirements of 
their participation in it, and the risks and benefits of t he study will be explained to potential participants by [CONTACT_322928][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained research assistant. If an individual declines participation, the reasons for this 
will be documented and permission to record relevant demographic data from cli nic records will be requested. 
This procedure allows for comparisons to be made between those who do and do not participate. If they 
consent to participate, they may do so either in written form or electronically.   
 
All minorities will  be encouraged to participate. Economically and educationally disadvantaged people, and 
participants who are employed at the clinical center (Stanford) will be eligible to enroll in this study if they meet all the study criteria. Subjects will be recruited from our clinics, th rough T1D community organizations, and 
through IRB approved patient recruitment lists. We will also use IRB approved recruitment materials to post the 
study on clinicaltrials.gov and to Stanford’s research and department websites. Participants may self -select to 
join the research by [CONTACT_607077]. These posts will provide contact [CONTACT_607078]. We will not interact with potential participants or enrolled 
participants through these media. We wi ll actively work to prevent harm to all subjects enrolled in the study. 
We will work to avoid coercion by [CONTACT_607079], as well as non -
university affiliated subjects. We will ensure that all participants are informe d that their participation is 
voluntary, that they will receive no ill treatment should they decide to not participate, and that they will receive 
no special advantages, aside from those mentioned in the "benefits" section of the consent, for participating  in 
the study.  
 
Participation will be voluntary . All participants must provide consent prior to inclusion in this research study. 
The primary investigator or a trained research coordinator will explain the nature, purpose, expected duration, and risks of study participation to each eligible participant. The primary investigator or trained research 
coordinator will also obtain consent and authorization for the release of personal information.   
 3.6.2. Protections Against Risk   
 All protocols and co nsent documents will be approved by [INVESTIGATOR_156401]’s IRB. All members of the research team 
have and will maintain current training in the ethical conduct of research. [CONTACT_607083]  has completed 
rigorous training in the protection of human subjects, including CI TI training, and graduate coursework at 
Yeshiva University . Research assistants and mentors/advisors working on the project will also complete 
standardized training in the protection of human subjects. The plan for protecting privacy and confidentiality recognizes that the protection of privacy in studies involving sensitive data is of utmost importance. We will 
attempt to do this in several ways. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained RA will introduce the study to eligible participants and 
explain the purposes, benefits, an d risks of the project to the subjects, and offer them an opportunity to ask 
questions and/or decline participation. The voluntary and confidential nature of the research, as well as limits to 
confidentiality, will be highlighted during informed consent pr ocess. Study participation will not interfere with 
clinical care and all patients have standard access to the ir treatment team on a routine (clinical care) and 
emergency basis. All responses to interview items will be given by [CONTACT_225753]. Internet  data collection 
will only occur through tools and resources that have acceptable security features. We will minimize all 
communications that involve names or other identifying information. All clinically  relevant and study information 
will be kept in locked files in locked offices or password protected files.  
 
Audio recordings of intervention sessions will be for quality control purposes only to ensure that sessions are 
delivered in a consistent way across participants. These audio recordings will be s aved on a password-
 
[ADDRESS_804296] on call 24/[ADDRESS_804297] access to phone numbers for a study physician. Participants in both groups will receive 
instruction about inserting and calibrating the sensor and will receive standardized introductory education 
about CGM. Participants are free to check blood glucose via fingerstick at any time and encouraged to do so 
if/when they notice a potential discrepan cy between CGM and fingerstick values. A person trained in delivering 
education about CGM will deliver the education about CGM use and will assist with inserting the first sensor. 
This individual will be available to assist with questions from participants . In addition, Dexcom representatives 
are available to the participants for technical questions or issues with the system, just like the access any 
Dexcom user has.  
 
3.7. Study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_607066]:  pregnancy, study -related adverse 
events (i.e. severe hypoglycemia, loss of consciousness, hypoglycemia related seizure, DKA related to study-related event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), severe skin infection requiring systemic antibiotics,  severe reaction to 
sensor tape, or other reasons that develop during the study that in the judgment of the investigator make it 
unadvisable for the subject to continue with the study

 CHAPTER 4: MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS  
 
4.1. Potential Benefits  
 
There are known benefits to people with T1D from using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), including 
increased time in target range, decreased time in hypoglycemia, decreased A1c, and improvements in 
diabetes distress (7, 8, 75, 76) . The potential benefit of this study is the provision of new knowledge about 
methods of optimizing the way that adults with T1D are introduced to CGM technology, with the long -term goal 
of informing methods for increasing device uptake and technology acce ptance in the future in this population. 
Participants may find intervention sessions interesting and relevant. Collection of the psychosocial and clinical 
data may provide information for diabetes clinicians and other stakeholders to help optimize the way that new 
beneficial technology is introduced to their patients. The low risk of this minimally -invasive study appears to be 
far outweighed by [CONTACT_607080].  
 
4.2. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 
Considering the relative ly low uptake of CGM technology among adults with T1D and known benefits to using 
this technology, combined with ADA recommendations for robust training and support for CGM use, there is an urgent need to develop tailored, innovative interventions that pat ients can receive at the appropriate time to 
support uptake and prevent discontinuation of CGM. The knowledge gained from this study will lead to the 
development of a comprehensive behavioral recommendation to optimize CGM use in adults with T1D. This 
study will inform future, larger -scale studies that evaluate CGM training programs and promote ways of 
increasing benefit from the device and key problem -solving skills to work through hassles and barriers to 
device use.  
 
4.3. Subject compensation  
 
There will be no cost to the participants for taking part in this research study. Participants will receive $25 for 
the completion of each of the four assessments for up to $[ADDRESS_804298] no more than minimal ri sk (e.g. blood draws, data collection, 
surveys, behavioral interventions, using FDA approved devices as recommended).

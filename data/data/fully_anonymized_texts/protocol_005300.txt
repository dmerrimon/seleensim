CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 27 September [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
Substudy-01 will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antiviral activity of GS-5894 
given as monotherapy in people with HIV-1 (PWH), who are either treatment-naive or 
treatment-experienced but naive to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class 
and have not received any antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) within 12 weeks of screening 
(full population details provided in Section 4). This is a substudy being conducted as part of the 
GS-US-544-[ADDRESS_202138] of 2 or 3 ARV drugs, often coformulated, allowing a 
one-pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], once-daily oral treatment regimen; these regimens result in virologic suppression in 
more than 80% of PWH {Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 2018}, {Gunthard 
2016}, {European Aids Clinical Society (EACS) 2021}, {World Health Organization (WHO) 
2016
}. A major factor preventing more widespread success of oral treatment is suboptimal 
adherence, a primary cause of incomplete viral suppression. There are multiple barriers to 
adherence, such as inconvenience, side effects, stigma, and discrimination {Enriquez 2011}.
Long-acting (LA) ARV regimens with less frequent dosing, for example LA injectable or oral 
weekly regimens, have the potential to address challenges with suboptimal adherence and 
treatment fatigue associated with daily oral therapy and improve success rates while also helpi[INVESTIGATOR_172610].
An oral weekly regimen could benefit individuals who desire an oral regimen but prefer a 
regimen that can be taken less frequently than daily.
Based on the available PK data (as of 22 June 2022) from the ongoing Phase 1a first-in-human 
(FIH) study GS-US-544-5906, the median terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) of GS-5894 was 
between 4.77 and 7.96 days. GS-5894 also exhibited high metabolic stability and a slow rate of 
metabolism in human hepatocytes. With these supporting data, GS-5894 has the potential to be 
administered orally once weekly and to be combined with other LA agents as part of a 
combination regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

[IP_ADDRESS].1. GS-US-544-[ADDRESS_202140] received either GS-5894 or 
placebo (3:1 ratio). Administration of single oral doses of GS-5894 225 mg (Cohort 1), 675 mg 
(Cohort 2), and 2025 mg (Cohort 3) is complete. In addition, [ADDRESS_202141] Cohort 5. Pharmacokinetic sampling for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, and Cohort 5 
(through at least Day 7) is complete. Pharmacokinetic data available as of 22 June 2022 are 
summarized below.
Preliminary PK Summary:
Preliminary GS-5894 plasma concentration-time profiles and preliminary PK parameters after 
administration of single oral doses of 225 mg (Cohort 1), 675 mg (Cohort 2), and 2025 mg 
(Cohort 3) in the fasted condition, as well as 675 mg with a low- or high-fat meal (Cohort 5) are 
presented in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Table 2 and Table 3. Median time to maximal plasma 
concentrations of GS-5894 (C max) occurred between 3.5 and 5.5 hours (median T max). A 9-fold 
increase in dose (from 225 mg to 675 mg and then 2025 mg) resulted in only 2.8-fold higher 
Cmax and 3.2-fold higher AUC 0-168h . The increases in C max and AUC 0-168h were less than dose 
proportional, suggesting GS-[ADDRESS_202142]; C max and AUC 0-168h following a 675 mg dose with a low-fat meal were 
3-fold higher and 3.6-fold higher compared with a 675 mg dose in the fasted condition. 
Similarly, C max and AUC 0-168h  following a 675 mg dose with a high-fat meal were 6.1-fold higher 
and 7.7-fold higher compared to a 675 mg dose in the fasted condition.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 27 September 2022Safety Summary:
In a preliminary blinded review of safety data as of 28 June 2022 (n = 43), no deaths, 
serious adverse events (SAEs), Grade 2 or higher adverse events (AEs), or discontinuations due 
to AEs have been reported to date. Two participants experienced AEs related to study drug; one 
in Cohort 2 (675 mg GS-5894) with proteinuria at Day 2 (resolved at Day 7) and one in Cohort 5 
(675 mg GS-5894, low-fat/moderate-calorie breakfast) with nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting at 
Day 1 (all resolved on same day). 
Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were reported for 3 participants and were not clinically relevant 
(creatinine clearance: 2 participants; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 1 participant).
No notable changes from predose in white bloods cells, eosinophils, or vital signs (systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) have been observed in 
the study. No clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities have been reported.
1.3. Rationale for Dose Selection of Study Drug
Selection of the GS-5894 doses for this study takes into consideration the available safety, 
tolerability, and PK data for GS-5894 from the ongoing FIH study with oral single and multiple 
ascending doses in healthy volunteers (Study GS-US-544-5906), as well as emerging preliminary 
safety and antiviral activity data in this substudy.
As of 28 June 2022, 43 participants (37 active and 6 placebo) have received a single oral dose of 
GS-5894 (225 to 2025 mg) or placebo-to-match. All participants have completed at least 7 days 
of follow up. As of the data cut-off date (28 June 2022), there were no deaths, SAEs, Grade 2 or 
higher AEs, or discontinuations due to AEs. GS-5894 was generally well-tolerated.
Available PK data from Study GS-US-544-5906 (as of 22 June 2022), as shown in Figure [ADDRESS_202143] C max and AUC 0-168h  
were observed following a 675-mg dose with a high-fat meal (Cohort 5B). Exposure margins 
based on observed data following 675 mg with a high-fat meal (Cohort 5B) were 14-fold and 
11-fold for AUC 0-168h  and 5-fold and 7-fold for C max compared with the dog and mouse 
NOAELs, respectively. Following a 675 mg dose with a high-fat meal, mean GS-5894 
concentrations achieved target IQ5 (that is 5-fold higher than the protein adjusted EC [ADDRESS_202144] 
wild type HIV-1 virus [paEC 95; 50.8 ng/mL]) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], and concentrations were maintained 
(> IQ5) through 72 hours postdose; mean GS-5894 concentrations at Day 8 and Day 12 were 
173.5 ng/mL (maintained above IQ3) and 115.5 ng/mL (maintained above IQ2), respectively. 
Based on these results, 675 mg with a high-fat meal was selected for evaluation in Cohort 1 of 
this substudy. Higher/lower doses (compared to Cohort 1 dose) may be evaluated in subsequent 
cohorts to target a range of IQ values to characterize the PK/PD relationship between GS-5894 
PK parameters and changes in HIV-1 viral load.

3.1. Study Design Overview
This substudy is being conducted as part of an umbrella study as described in the master 
protocol.
Substudy-01 is an open-label, Phase 1b, single/multiple-dose, multicohort study to evaluate the 
safety, PK, and antiviral activity of GS-[ADDRESS_202145] not received 
any ART within 12 weeks of screening, including medications received for pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) or postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Any current or prior receipt of long-
acting parenteral ARVs such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting HIV-1, injectable 
cabotegravir, or injectable rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_172608].
After screening and meeting all eligibility criteria, study drug dosing will be initiated on Day 1 in 
the clinic for each participant (Figure 1). Participants will be required to return to the clinic for 
visits on Days 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 (primary endpoint assessment). After assessments on 
Day 11 or upon early termination (ET), participants will initiate a regimen of 
Biktarvy® (bictegravir [BIC, B]/emtricitabine [FTC, F]/tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]; BVY) 
provided by [CONTACT_456], or other non-NNRTI based standard of care (SOC) ART regimen 
selected by [CONTACT_093]. If participants are switching to BVY, a 30-day supply will be given 
to provide coverage for up to 5 half-lives of GS-5894. Participants will be required to return to 
the clinic for follow-up visits on Days 18, 25, and 39. Overnight fasting (≥ 6 hours) is required 
for laboratory analyses prior to visit on Days 1, 3, 7, 11, 18, 25, and 39.

11.1. Pregnancy Precautions, Definition of Childbearing Potential, and 
Contraceptive Requirements
1) Definitions
a. Definition of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study, a participant assigned female at birth is considered of childbearing 
potential following the initiation of puberty (Tanner Stage 2) until becoming postmenopausal 
unless the participant is permanently sterile or has medically documented ovarian failure.
Participants assigned female at birth are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they 
are at least [ADDRESS_202157] 12 months may also be considered postmenopausal if 
their follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level is in the postmenopausal range and they are not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.
Permanent sterilization includes hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_90254] a female participant of any age.
b. Definition of Fertility in a Participant Assigned Male at Birth
For the purposes of this study, a participant assigned male at birth is considered fertile after the 
initiation of puberty unless the participant is permanently sterile by [CONTACT_172622].
2) Contraception Requirements for Participants Assigned Female at Birth
a. Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception
GS-[ADDRESS_202158] version of the IB for additional information.
b. Contraception Requirements for Participants Assigned Female at Birth of 
Childbearing Potential
The inclusion of participants assigned female at birth of childbearing potential requires the use of 
highly effective contraceptive measures with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. They must 
also not rely on hormone-containing contraceptives as a form of birth control during the study. 
They must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative pregnancy test at 
GS–5894
Protocol GS-US–544–[ADDRESS_202159] agree to one of the 
following contraceptive methods:
Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential. Abstinence is an acceptable 
method of contraception only when it is in line with the participant’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle.
Or
Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below:
Nonhormonal intrauterine device (IUD)
Bilateral tubal occlusion (upon medical assessment of surgical success)
Vasectomy in the partner assigned male at birth (upon medical assessment of surgical 
success)
Inclusion of methods of contraception in this list of permitted methods does not imply that the 
method is approved in any country or region. Methods should only be used if locally approved.
Participants assigned female at birth and of childbearing potential must also refrain from egg 
donation and in vitro fertilization during treatment and until the end of contraception 
requirement.
3) Contraception Requirements for Participants Assigned Male at Birth
It is theoretically possible that a relevant systemic concentration of study drug may be achieved 
in a partner assigned female at birth from exposure to the participant’s seminal fluid and pose a 
potential risk to an embryo/fetus. A participant assigned male at birth with a partner assigned 
female at birth and of childbearing potential must use condoms during treatment and until 
[ADDRESS_202160] also refrain from sperm donation and cryopreservation 
of germ cells during treatment and until the end of contraception requirement.

lactational amenorrhea method. A female condom and a male condom should not be used 
together.
5) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy
Participants assigned female at birth will be instructed to notify the investigator if they become 
pregnant or suspect they are pregnant at any time from the start of the study until [ADDRESS_202161] also report the 
information to the investigator. Instructions for reporting pregnancy, partner pregnancy, and

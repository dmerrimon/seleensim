 1. INTRODUCTION 
 Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) is a life threatening and serious infection throughout the world.  
The World Health Organization estimates between 30-43 million people are living wi th HIV worldwide. The 
natural progression of the disease cripples the immune system, leading to uncheck ed infections and 
ultimately death. 
 
 With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we saw HIV transform from a terminal 
infection into a chronic disease that was managed with drugs. This transformation, howe ver, required three 
drug combination regimens to prevent HIV from developi[INVESTIGATOR_90671]. This  resulted in 
numerous pi[INVESTIGATOR_90672]. As tr eatments evolved, therapy 
required fewer pi[INVESTIGATOR_90673]. This tre nd eventually gave way to 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) co-formulated into a single tablet, 
ATRIPLA®. This was the advent of the single tablet regimen —one pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], once a day. ATRIPLA® has many 
years of proven efficacy and improved patient adherence1 
 
 With the continued evolution of potent HAART, virologically suppressed HIV -infected patients are often 
switched to safer and better tolerated drugs1. Both older patients with age associated comorbidities and 
younger patients, who can fairly expect to be on antivirals for many years to c ome, are rightly concerned 
about side effects and toxicities of long term exposure to highly potent medications . Patients depend on 
their providers to optimize long term safety and tolerability in their antiretroviral th erapy. 
 
1.1 Rationale for the Study  
 Therapeutic dosage of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) component of ATRIPL A® requires plasma 
concentrations of the drug that are associated with nephrotoxicity and decreased bon e mineral density3.  
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) has a unique metabolism that results in hi gher intracellular levels of 
the active phosphorylated moiety tenofovir-diphosphate2. Compared with TDF, the therapeutic dosage of 
TAF reduces tenofovir plasma concentrations by [CONTACT_46431] 90%. This reduction in plasma concentrati on results 
in decreased renal and bone risks.  TAF has the potential to improve on the efficacy and safety profile of 
TDF. 
 
 Efavirenz, another component of ATRIPLA® is widely associated with neuropsychi atric side-effects, 
including sleep disturbances, depression, and anxiety4. Switching from Efavirenz to an integrase inhibitor 
is associated with improvements in mood5,6.  
 
 Bictegravir (BIC) is a novel, once daily integrase inhibitor. It has been sho wn to have potent antiviral activity, 
a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, good tolerability and an improved resistance prof ile when compared to 
previous integrase inhibitors.10,11. In a phase 2 trial investigating previously untreated people with HIV, 
bictegravir plus emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (BIKTARVY®) vs  dolutegravir, plus emtricitabine 
and tenofovir alafenamide both showed high efficacy up to 24 weeks and bo th regimens were well 
tolerated.12 
 
 Additionally, switching HAART experienced patients to BIKTARVY® has been s hown to be non-inferior to 
continuation of regimens containing Atazanavir or Darunavir, when they  were given with either 
lamivudine/abacavir or FTC/TDF.13 
 
 We plan to evaluate in a real world setting the efficacy, safety and tolerabil ity of switching from the older, 
established single tablet regimen of ATRIPLA® (EFV/FTC/TDF) to a new single tabl et regimen of 
BIKTARVY® (BIC/FTC/TAF). 
 
 Within the limitations of a real-world study, we have attempted to replicate t he protocol of [COMPANY_009] Science’s 
Phase 3 study evaluating a switch to BIC/FTC/TAF from dolutegravir plus eithe r FTC/TAF or FTC/TDF14.  
This will have the potential benefit of comparing different regimen switches  as well as potentially adding 
robustness to the body of data regarding BIC/FTC/TAF.

6.2.5  Virologic Failure 
Virologic failure is defined as virologic rebound or having HIV- 1 RNA ≥  50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at study 
discontinuation or week 48   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Viral Rebound 
Subjects who meet either of the criteria listed below will be considered to have viro logic rebound: 
• At any post Day 1 Visit, an HIV- 1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL which is subsequently confirmed at the following  
visit (scheduled or unscheduled) 
• Any subject with HIV- 1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at study drug discontinuati on  
Following the unconfirmed virologic rebound, subjects will be asked to return to the c linic for a blood draw, 
[ADDRESS_99943] that had an RNA ≥50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  If virol ogic rebound is confirmed

 and the HIV- 1 RNA is ≥ 200 copie s/mL, the blood sample from the confirmation visit will be the primary 
sample used for HIV- [ADDRESS_99944]’s first post -baseline resistance 
test, additional testing will be conducted on a case- by-case basis. Any subject may be discontinued at 
Inves tigator’s discretion or per local treatment guidelines.  
If no resistance is detected from the genotype or phenotype, the subject ma y remain on study drug and 
HIV-[ADDRESS_99945] should be again repeated 2-3 weeks later. If HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL remains 
Investigators should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of remaining on study drug and document this 
assessment in the on-site medical record. 
Subjects who are nonadherent on an ongoing basis will be considered for disconti nuation per the 
Investigator’s discretion or local treatment guidelines. Sub-investigators who opt to discontinue study drugs 
for an individual subject must discuss with the Investigator prior to study drug discontinuation. 
For subjects who are off study drug but remain in study, it will be the Investigator’s discretion to manage  
virologic rebound.

 Version: Original, Date: 21 Feb 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 38 
 
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. An AE can be any unfavorable and/or 
unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal pro duct whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs may also include  pre or post treatment 
complications that occur, as a result of protocol specified procedures, lack of effi cacy, over dose, drug 
abuse/misuse reports, or occupational exposure. Preexisting events that increase in severity  or change in 
nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be con sidered AEs. 
 An AE does not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures such a surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, and transf usion. The condition 
that led to the procedure may be an adverse event and must be reported. 
• Preexisting diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected b efore the screening visit 
that do not worsen. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_90676], social or convenience admissions) 
• Overdose without clinical sequalae (see Section 7.6.1) 
• Any Medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality  with an onset date before the consent 
form is signed and not related to a protocol associated procedure is not an AE. It is considered to be 
preexisting and should be documented in the medical record. 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 A serious adverse event (SEA) is defined as an event that, at any dose, results in the  following: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of event. It does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of study subject born after subject received study drug  
• A medically important event or reaction that may not immediately result i n death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or life-
threatening event but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to preve nt an SAE from 
occurring. Medical and scientific judgement must be exercised to determine whether s uch an event is 
reportable under expedited reporting rules. Examples of this type of occurrence would inc lude intensive 
treatment for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
development of drug dependency/abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections result ing from 
contaminated medical product will be considered a medically important event and s ubject to expedited 
reporting requirements. 
7.1.3  Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious     
Adverse Events 
 Laboratory abnormalities ( e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) that require medic al or 
surgical intervention or lead to study drug interruption, modification or discontinu ation must be recorded 
as an AE or SAE. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments ( e.g., EKG, x-rays, and vital 
signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SA E if they meet 
the definition detailed in Sections 7.1.[ADDRESS_99948] the syndrome or diagnosis, not the laboratory result (i.e. “anemia ,” not “decreased hemoglobin”).  
 For specific information on handling of clinical laboratory abnormalities in th is study, please refer to Section 
7.5. 
7.2  Assessment of Adverse Events  
 
 
BIKTARVY® (BIC/FTC/TAF)                 Protocol IN- US-380-4543                   Midland Research Group, Inc.  
   
 Version: Original, Date: 21 Feb 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 38 
 
  The investigator or qualified sub-investigator is responsible for assessing  AEs and SAEs for causality and 
severity as well as for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and  assessments. 
7.2.1  Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures 
 The investigator or qualified sub-investigator is responsible for assessing t he relationship to the study drug 
using clinical judgement and the following considerations: 
• No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug. For SAEs, an 
alternative causality must be provided (e.g., preexisting condition, underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). 
• Yes:  There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257].  
 It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in the 
context of adverse reporting. 
 The relationship to study procedures (e.g., invasive procedures such as venipunc ture) should be assessed 
using the following considerations: 
• No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study procedure. 
• Yes:  The adverse event occurred, as a result of protocol procedures. 
7.2.2  Assessment of severity 
 AE severity should be recorded and graded according to the Grading Scale for Sev erity of Adverse Events 
and laboratory Abnormalities (Appendix 2). For AE associated with laboratory a bnormalities, the event 
should be graded on the basis of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; which might 
not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. 
 The distinction between the seriousness and the severity of an AE shoul d be noted. Severe is a measure 
of intensity; a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious reaction. For exampl e, a subject might have a 
headache that is described as severe but would not be considered a SAE unless it met one of the criteria 
for serious events. 
7.[ADDRESS_99949] 
be reported to the study database. 
 All AEs should be followed up until resolution/return to baseline or until the  adverse event is stable, if 
possible.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_99950] be reported. This also 
includes any SAEs resulting from protocol associated procedures performed after inf ormed consent is 
signed. 
 Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the protocol defined fol low up period; however, 
if the investigator learns of any SAEs that occur after study participation has  concluded and the event is 
deemed relevant to the use of the study drug, they should promptly document and report the event. 
7.4        Toxicity Management  
 All clinical events and clinically significant laboratory toxici ties will be managed according to uniform 
guidelines detailed in Appendix 2 and as outlined below. 
• Clinical events and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities  will be graded according to the 
Grading Scale for Severity of Adverse Events and laboratory Abnormalities (Appendix 2 ). 
 
 
BIKTARVY® (BIC/FTC/TAF)                 Protocol IN- US-380-4543                   Midland Research Group, Inc.  
   
 Version: Original, Date: 21 Feb 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 of 38 
 
 • Grade 3 and 4 clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be  confirmed by [CONTACT_90710] 7 calendar days of receiving results and before study drug discontinu ation, unless such a delay 
is not consistent with good medical practice. 
 Any questions regarding toxicity management should be directed to the Investigator. 
7.4.1  Grades 1 and 2 Clinical Event or Laboratory Abnormality  
 Continue study drug at the discretion of the Investigator 
7.4.2  Grade 3 Clinical Event or Laboratory Abnormality 
 For Grade 3 clinical event or clinically significant laboratory ab normality, study drug may be continued if the 
event is considered to be unrelated to study drug. 
 For a Grade 3 clinical event or clinically significant laboratory abnormal ity confirmed by [CONTACT_90711] , study drug will be withheld until the toxicity returns to ≤ grade 
2. When restarting study drug following resolution of the adverse event, the study drug sho uld be restarted 
at full dose. 
 If following re-challenge with study drug a laboratory abnormalit y returns to ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_99951].  
 A clinically significant Grade 4 laboratory abnormality that is not conf irmed by [CONTACT_90712]. 
 Study drug may be continued without dose interruption for a clinically non-s ignificant Grade 4 laboratory 
abnormality (e.g., elevated CK after significant exercise or triglycerid e elevation on a non-fasting specimen) 
or a clinical event considered unrelated to the study drug, but must be discussed with the Inv estigator. 
7.4.4  ALT Flare 
 Defined as: serum ALT > 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and > 2 times Day  1 value, confirmed with repeat 
testing within 3 days of original results receipt, with or without associated symptoms 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of ALT Flare 
 When initial results are received, schedule subject to return to the clinic as soon as pos sible (ideally within 
3 days of initial blood draw). During the visit, in addition to redrawing blood for repeat CMP  testing, clinical 
assessment of the subject will be performed. The assessment should include a phy sical examination and 
evaluation of the subject’s mental status.  
 If ALT elevation is confirmed, the following labs should be performed: pla sma HBV DNA, HBV serology 
(HBsAg and HBsAb), HAC IgM, HCV serology, quantitative HDV RNA.  
 Based on the results of the confirmatory tests, the following treatment modifications are recomm ended: 
Elevated liver enzymes, normal or stable total bilirubin relative to Day 1 
 If ALT levels are elevated (as specified in Section 7.4.4) with normal or stable total bilirubin, the 
subject may remain on the study drug and should be monitored weekly until ALT lev els return to 
normal or Day 1 level. During monitoring, if the ALT values remain persisten tly elevated, the 
Investigator considers whether the study drug should be discontinued. 
Elevated liver enzymes, elevated total bilirubin

 Version: Original, Date: 21 Feb 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 of 38 
 
  If ALT levels are elevated (as specified in Section 7.4 .4) and total bilirubin is confirmed to be ≥ 2 x 
Day 1 value and is > ULN, the investigator should consider discontinuing the study drug. The subject 
should be monitored weekly until ALT and total bilirubin levels return to normal or Day [ADDRESS_99952] exhibiting signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities sugg estive of possible hepatobiliary 
toxicity should undergo thorough examination and clinical workup as deemed  appropriate by [CONTACT_3786]. Consideration should be given to appropriate imaging studies ( e.g., ultrasound of the liver and 
biliary tree) and potential consultation with a gastroenterologist with specialty tr aining in hepatobiliary 
diseases. 
7.[ADDRESS_99953] labelling (as it applies to the daily dose of the subject in question). I n cases of a discrepancy 
in drug accountability, overdose will be established only when it is clear that the subject has taken the 
excess dose(s). Overdose cannot be established when the subject cannot account f or the discrepancy 
except in cases in which the investigator has reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional 
dose(s). 
 Product complaint is defined as complaints arising from potential deviations in the manufacture, packaging, 
or distribution of the medicinal product. 
 Occupational exposure is defined as exposure to a medicinal product as a result of one’s professional or 
non-professional occupation. 
7.6.2  Instructions for Reporting Special Situations 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Instructions for Reporting Pregnancies 
 The Investigator will report pregnancies in subjects that are identified after initiation of  the study drug and 
throughout the study to [COMPANY_009]. 
 The subject should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the pregnancy .  
 
 
BIKTARVY® (BIC/FTC/TAF)                 Protocol IN- US-380-4543                   Midland Research Group, Inc.

  The pregnancy itself is not considered an AE nor is an induced electiv e abortion to terminate a pregnancy 
without medical reasons. 
 Any premature termination of pregnancy (e.g., spontaneous abortion, induced therapeutic aborti on due to 
complications or other medical reasons) must be reported within [ADDRESS_99954] study will be reported to 
[COMPANY_009]. 
 The outcome should be reported to [COMPANY_009] via email or fax to: 
 Email: [EMAIL_201]  
 Fax: [PHONE_2139] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Other Special Situations 
 Any inappropriate use of concomitant medications prohibited by [CONTACT_90713] 
“misuse,” but may be more appropriately documented as a protocol deviation.  
 Refer to Section 7.3 for full instructions on the mechanism of special situation reporting.  
 All clinical sequelae in relation to these special situation repo rts will be reported as AEs or SAEs at the 
same time using the AE EMR and/or the SAE report form. Details of the symptoms  and si gns, clinical 
management, and outcome will be reported, when available.  
 
8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1  Analysis   
The efficacy analysis endpoints are as follows:  
8.1.[ADDRESS_99955] HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at week 
48, as defined by [CONTACT_90706]. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_99956] HIV-1 RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at Week 48, as defined by [CONTACT_90707]. 
2. The change in serum creatinine from Day [ADDRESS_99957] 1 dose of study drug will be 
excluded from all analysis.

 Version: Original, Date: [ADDRESS_99958] 1 dose of study drug. All the data collected up to 30 days  after subjects 
permanently discontinue their study drug will be included in the safety  summaries, unless specified 
otherwise. 
8.3 Data Handling Conventions 
 For analysis purposes, laboratory data that are continuous in nature but are ≤ the lower limit or ≥ the upper 
limit of quantitation will be inputted to the value of the lower limit minus 1 or upper limit plus 1 significant 
digit, respectively (e.g., If HIV- 1 RNA results of ‘No HIV -1 RNA detected’ and ‘≤ 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL HIV-1 RNA 
detected’ will be inputted as 49 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL). 
 Missing data can have an impact upon the interpretation of the trial data. In general , values for missing data 
from the specified visit will not be inputted. However, a missing pre-tr eatment laboratory result would be 
treated as normal (i.e. No toxicity grade) for the laboratory abnormality summary. 
 All available data for subjects that do not complete the study will be included in dat a listings.

[IP_ADDRESS] US FDA-defined Snapshot Algorithm 
 All HIV-1 RNA data collected on-treatment (i.e. including data collected up  to [ADDRESS_99960] dose date 
of the study drug) will be used in the snapshot algorithm. Virologic outcome will be defined as the following 
categories: 
• HIV-1 RNA < 50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL :  subjects who meet this criteria by [CONTACT_90714]-

2. 
 Incidence of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities, defined as values that incr ease at least [ADDRESS_99963] dose of study drug plus 
30 days will be summarized. If baseline data are missing, then any graded abnormal ity (i.e., at least a 
Grade1) will be considered treatment emergent. The maximum post baseline toxi city grade will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_90715]. 
 Laboratory abnormalities that occur before the first dose of study drug or after the las t dose of study drug 
plus 30 days will be included in a data listing.

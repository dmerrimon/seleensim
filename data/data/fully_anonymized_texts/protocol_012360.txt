1. Protocol Title  
 
An assessor -blinded, randomized, controlled, single center, parallel design trial with patient masking 
to compare early postoperative gastric emptying associated with rocuronium neuromuscular 
reversal with sugammadex versus neostigmine in adults undergoing colon and rectal surgery  
 
2. Objectives  
Primary Hypothesis : We hypothesize that compared to neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, reversal of 
rocuronium neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex will increase gastric emptying in patients 
undergoing colorectal surgery.  
 
Primary Objective: To determine if a strategy of rocuronium neuromuscular blockade reversal with 
sugammadex will increase gastric emptying as assessed by [CONTACT_523208], compared to neostigmine and glycopyrrolate.  
 
Secondary Objectives :  
1. To determine if a strategy of rocuronium neuromuscular blockade reversal with sugammadex will reduce time to first bowel movement, compared to neostigmine.  
2. To determine if a strategy of rocuronium neuromuscular blockade reversal with sugammadex will reduce the proportion (percentage) of patients with a gastrointestinal complication (anastomotic leak, postoperative ileus, reoperation, or organ space infection), compared to 
neostigmine.  
3. To determine if a strategy of rocuronium neuromuscular blockade reversal with sugammadex 
will reduce the time between administration of reversal agent to achievement of a train -of-
four ratio > 0.9, compared to neostigmine.  
4. To determine if a strategy of rocuronium neuromuscular blockade reversal with sugammadex will reduce Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) phase [ADDRESS_678986], long length of stay, high postoperative surgical site infection rate, high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and a high rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369670].
1-3  The 30 -day mortality rate after open or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is 
high —in many studies around 3%.1,4-6 A six year study of over 170,000 patients having colon and 
rectal resections for malignant and non -malignant disease found a 30 -day mortality rate of 8.5%.[ADDRESS_678987] importance in avoiding patient discomfort, morbidity, and 
mortality after colorectal surgery.  The incidence of postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery has been reported to be 10 -25%.
3,8,9 Postoperative ileus is defined as intolerance of oral intake due to a 
lack of coordinated bowel motility.10  Significant attention has been paid to the development of 
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ZIP_CODE] v07.25.2020           Page 3 of 21  guidelines and programs to reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus and accelerate return of 
bowel function after colorectal surgery.  
 The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) created an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol to promote the following outcomes in patients undergoing color ectal surgery: 
“freedom from nausea, freedom from pain at rest, early return of bowel function, improved wound healing, and early hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]”.
[ADDRESS_678988] many of these outcomes; in particular, nausea may be reduced, constipation-associated pain at rest may decline, return of bowel function would be accelerated, and time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523194].  While administration of medications such as Alvimopan and 
adjustments in anesthetic technique (providing epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187], minimizing crystalloid administration, using multimodal analgesia) are recommended, sugammadex  is not currently 
considered in the ERAS protocol.
[ADDRESS_678989] on postoperative bowel function.  It is hypothesized that a randomized, controlled trial involving patients having colorectal surgery will find faster gastric 
emptying, less nausea, and less gastrointestinal complications (including ileus) when sugammadex is administered to reverse rocuronium neuromuscular blockad e, compared to neostigmine.  
 The purpose of this study is to determine if administering sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade instead of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, a strategy that avoids cholinergic effects on the bowel, is associated with faster gastric emptying, shorter time to first bowel movement , less post -
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ZIP_CODE] v07.25.2020           Page 4 of 21  surgical gastrointestinal complications , faster time to achieve a TOFr > 0.9, shorter PACU phase 1 
recovery, and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  If sugammadex is shown to improve the 
aforementioned outcomes, an argument can be made that sugammadex should be considered for inclusion in the ERAS protocol for Colorectal surgery.  
 
4. Study Design  
 
Design : Assessor -blinded, randomized, controlled, single center, parallel design trial with patient 
masking  
 
Intervention Arm: Sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium neuromuscular blockade will be 
administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg actual body weight once T2 has reappeared on the train -of-four, 
in accordance with product labeling.1 
 
Control/Standard Arm: Neostigmine and glycopyrrolate will be administered in a dose and ratio 
consistent with product labeling and best practice2-4 once T2 has reappeared on the train- of-four (i.e. 
0.07 mg/kg neostigmine actual body weight to a maximum of 5 mg given concomitantly with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate for every 1 mg neostigmine).  
 
Randomization and Assignment: Patients will be randomly assigned to either the intervention 
(sugammadex) or control (neostigmine) arm. Before initiation of the clinical portion of the study, 120 opaque sealed envelopes will be prepared by a researcher not involved in patient recruitment or 
enrollment: 60 for the intervention arm and 60 for the control arm.  These envelopes will be 
randomized without stratification via a computer- generated random allocation sequence and 
numbered in ascending order from 1 to 120.  A block size of 6 will be used for random number 
generation to ensure balanced assignments over time. Patients enrolled in the study will be assigned to the next free envelope and given the corresponding treatment contained therein.  All researchers involved in patient recruitment, allocation, and assessment will be kept blind to the allocation sequence.  
 
Research Integrity : The study will be assessed for initial approval by [CONTACT_4707] 
(IRB) at OHSU, Portland, OR, [LOCATION_003], and given a unique identifier for ongoing review . 
  5. Study Population  
 
a. Number of Subjects  
 
Study Size: 60 subjects will be enrolled in the intervention (sugammadex) arm and 60 patients will be enrolled in the control (neostigmine

Study Location: Single center study performed at OHSU in Portland, OR, [LOCATION_003] in the South 
Operating Rooms (highest acuity operating rooms).  Subjects  will be enrolled in the preoperative 
area of the South Operating Room Suite.  All study interventions will occur in the South Operating Room preoperative area, the operating rooms, or in the Post -Anesthesia Care Unit.  Data 
collection will continue to occu r throughout the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
  
e. Recruitment Methods  
 
Patient Recruitment and Enrollment :  
 Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_523209] (Verona, Wisconsin)  as early as two months prior to 
a potential subject’s scheduled surgery.   
 
We will review all the inclusion/exclusion criteria as early as two months prior to a potential 
subject’s scheduled surgery.  If a potential subject has been identified as meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, an approved study  staffer will call the subject, using 
an approved phone script (included in ‘Consent Form and Recruitment Materials’ section of application) to introduce the study.  
 If interested, the patient will receive a follow up email that includes the informed consent .   
 
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ADDRESS_678990] is not interested in participating in the study, the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
any other information related to this subject will be destroyed.  
 The study will be listed on ClinicalTrials.gov to provide subjects, family members, and the public 
background  information on the study.  
 
Other than posting this study on OHSU Study Participation Opportunities, we do not expect to create advertisements for the study.   
 There will be no payments to subjects, we do not have funds to offer subjects payment for participation in the study.  
  f. Consent Process  
  The consent process will take place in a private and confidential area. All subjects that are approached for recruitment will hear a description of the study, reasons for pursuing this research study, options for opting out the research protocol or not com pleting data collection, 
and potential risks, advantages, and disadvantages from participating.    We will ask subjects to 
reiterate their understanding of how the study will affect their care and allow time for questions before collecting a signature [CONTACT_523221]. Subjects that agree to participate in the study will be asked to sign a written informed consent that has been approved by [CONTACT_232730]. An electronic copy of the signed consent will be scanned into the subject’s medical records 
system. A copy of the signed consent, describing the research study and providing contact [CONTACT_100149].  
 [CONTACT_523222]  will serve as medical monitor and will conduct periodic reviews to ensure that 
proper consent devoid of coercion is being collected as the study progresses.  [CONTACT_390581] is an 
anesthesiologist at OHSU and the Associate Chief of Quality and Safety for the Department of Anesthesiology.  She has clinical trial experience. [CONTACT_390581] is currently the PI [INVESTIGATOR_523195].  
 Non -English speaking  subjects will be enrolled with the help of an interpreter for all telephone 
communications, in -person procedures including obtaining consent, and study follow up.  The 
short consent form will be used.

7. Data and Specimen s 
a. Handling of Data and Specimens  
 
Study subjects will be assigned a unique study number after enrollment in the study.  All data 
points, procedure related data, and electronic files for data analysis will be linked only to this unique study number.  This study number will not contain any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers such as: geographic location, dates related to the individual, medical record number, account numbers, etc.  The key linking study subjects to study code will be kept in a cloud location with 
special protection for confidential and restricted health information (the OHSU Box).  Only the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_100133].  
 Data collected in the course of the study will be stored in Qualtrics on an OHSU server.  Data will be managed by [CONTACT_523211] , an analyst within the Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine 
Research Division.  Again, this data tool will be only be made available to study personnel though a secure online log -in.  Secure data will be stored in Qualtrics  for indefinite use.  Data in Qualtrics  
will be linked only to subject study code, not to any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers.   
 Any data that is shared will be transmitted in an encrypted manner over a secure network.  Transmitted data will be labeled only with the study code, none of the 18 HIPAA identifiers.  When data is transmitted, the transmitter (research personnel with access to Qualtrics ) will be 
responsible for sending the data in a protected manner.   Any person receiving data will then assume responsibility for patient confidentiality and data integrity.   
 Seven blood samples will be drawn after surgery.  Samples will be kept on ice in a cooler in the PACU until all samples for a given subject have been collected. The cooler will be kept by [CONTACT_523212].  Specimens will be labeled with subject study number and time the sample was drawn. For example, the blood sample for study subject #1 drawn 15 minutes after reversal will be labeled “1 -T15”. Samples will then be 
prepared by [CONTACT_100154] 2000xg at 4C  for 15 minutes.  Samples will be stored in a freezer at -
80C in the Anesthesia Research  Refrigerator , Mackenzie  Hall Room #2148.  This is a secure locked 
area used for research.  Samples will be stored in this room for 1 to 4 weeks.  Samples will be batched and taken to the Bioanalytical Shared Resource/Pharmacokinetics Core at OHSU where they will be analyzed and discarded in accordance with blood waste guidelines in the Bioanalytical Shared Resource/Pharmacokinetics Core at OHSU. There will be no long te rm 
storing of plasma samples in the Bioanalytical Shared Resource/Pharmacokinetics Core.    
 
b. Sharing of Results with Subjects  
 Study results will not be available to subjects at the time of participation.  All subjects will be given the contact [CONTACT_49162] (Brandon Togioka) and told that they may contact [CONTACT_523213] -identified data at the conclusion of the study.  
Patients will also be able to obtain a free copy of any published data should they indicate interest.  The study will not generate any genetic information or imaging studies.   
 
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ADDRESS_678999] additional research on this data set  or to send data to a separate repository.  Should an additional study be conceived 
IRB approval would be obtained before proceeding with data analysis.  Requests for release of data would be addressed to the principal investigator.  Release of data would need to be approved by [CONTACT_458], Director of Research, and Chair of the Department of Anesthesiology.  No groups are exc luded from requesting data access.  All de -identified data 
within the Qualtrics database would be available for release.  A data sharing agreement would be required before the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_523198] Q ualtrics.  
 
 
 
8. Data Analysis  
Data Analysis : 
 The database will be created and managed by [CONTACT_523211], a computer scientist within the Clinical 
Research Division of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine.  [CONTACT_523223], an associate professor 
in biostatistics, will be responsible for performing the statistical analysis described herein.  The research team led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Brandon Togioka will be responsible for interpreting the data.   
  
Blinding of Data:  
 The statistician will be responsible for generat ing the  random assignment list. Study subjects will be 
assigned a unique study number after enrollment. The key linking subject study numbers to the allocation sequence will be kept in an OHSU approved cloud location with special protection for confidential and restricted health information (the OHSU Box).  The data manager, Praveen Tekkali, will guard this key.  The outcome assessor will not be in the operating room when allocation is revealed or when neuromuscular reversal is administered.  Variables that need to be retrieved from the electronic medical record will be pulled by [CONTACT_523214].  After data 
collection is complete for the final patient the key linking the subject study numbers to the allocation 
sequence will be given to the statistician.  At this point the remainder of the research team will be kept blinded in case data cleaning is necessary.  For the purpose of the final analysis, the official clinical database will not be unblinded to the rest of the research team until medical/scientific review has been completed, protocol violators have been identified (if appropriate), data has been declared complete, and statistical analysis is finished.  
 
Variables/Time Points of Interest  
 
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ZIP_CODE] v07.25.2020           Page 14 of 21  Primary Endpoint : Gastric emptying to be assessed by [CONTACT_523215] 150 minutes by [CONTACT_523216].  In addition, the 
individual paracetamol plasma concentrations will be compared between study arms at the following timepoints after neuromuscular reversal: 15 (T15), 30 (T30), 45 (T45), 60 (T60), 90 (T90), 120 (T120), and 150 (T150) minutes.  
 The paracetamol absorption test is a validated test for assessment of gastric emptying that is more feasible in the perioperative setting than the gold standard of scintigraphy.
1-[ADDRESS_679000] 
performed with nuclear medicine. It is a costly outpatient procedure that exposes patients to radiation.  Paracetamol is poorly absorbed in the stomach, but is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_523199].
4  
Thus, gastric emptying is the rate limiting step to allowing paracetamol to be absorbed into the blood stream.
4  Accordingly, higher plasma concentrations of paracetamol are associated with faster gastric 
emptying.  
 Please note, we realize [COMPANY_006] & Co. has experts in the field of pharmacokinetics.  We would be more than happy to work with these experts to optimize our paracetamol absorption test.  
 
Secondary  Endpoint: Time to first bowel movement .  This variable will be monitored on an ongoing daily 
basis until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].   
 
Secondary  Endpoint: The proportion (percentage) of patients with a gastrointestinal complication.  
Gastrointestinal complications will include the following: anastomotic leak, postoperative ileus, 
reoperation, and organ space infection.  National Surgical Quality Improvement Project definitions will 
be used.[ADDRESS_679001] a complication related to the index operation within 30 postoperative days.
6 
4. Organ space infection will include infections within 30 days of the index operation that involve a structure, other than the skin, that was manipulated.  
 
Secondary Endpoint: The time between injection of sugammadex or neostigmine and achievement of 
train -of-four ratio ≥ 0.9.  T he TwitchView electromyograph will set to automatically check a train -of-four 
ratio every 20 seconds.  These data points will be saved in the TwitchView monitor for download and 
analysis at a later time.  A research coordinator in the PACU will turn off the TwitchView device once three consecutive ratios are ≥  0.9.  If a train -of-four ratio ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_679002] incomplete reversal and train- of-four counts 
will cease to be measured.  
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ZIP_CODE] v07.25.2020           Page 15 of 21  Secondary  Endpoint : Phase 1 PACU recovery time.  PACU phase 1 recovery time is defined as the time 
required to attain pain control and stable respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], hemodynamic, and neurologic status.  This variable 
will be assessed by a research coordinator in the PACU on postoperative day zero.  
 
Secondary  Endpoint : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] .  This variable will be monitored on an ongoing daily basis 
until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
Safety Endpoints : 
1. In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523200] a death in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  This variable will be monitored 
on an ongoing daily basis until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
2. Drug hypersensitivity reaction will be defined by [CONTACT_288881], urticaria, new edema, sudden 
hypotension or tachycardia, or wheezing within [ADDRESS_679003] pressure in the PACU. This variable will be assessed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_523217].  
5. Bradycardia will be defined by a heart rate < 60 beats per minute at any time while the patient 
is in the PACU.  This variable will be assessed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_523217].  
6. Tachycardia will be defined by a heart rate > 100 beats per minute at any time while the patient 
is in the PACU. This variable will be assessed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_523217].  
7. Unremitting coughing  will be defined as ≥ [ADDRESS_679004] deviation , median and range  for continuous  
characteristics and frequencies and percentages for categorical characteristics, overall as well as by [CONTACT_19313].   
 
All statistical analysis will use intent- to-treat patient population.  
 
Primary analysis : Welch’s t -test will be used to test for a treatment effect for the primary endpoint of 
area under the curve at 150 minutes. Log transformation will be applied to the AUC when necessary.  
The Welch’s t -test will also be used to test for a treatment effect for paracetamol plasma concentration 
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ADDRESS_679005] model will be used to compare the treatment 
effects over time (from T15 to T150) for the two groups.  
 
Secondary analysis: Welch’s t -test will be used to test for a treatment effect for the secondary endpoints 
time to first bowel movement, time to achieve a train -of-four ratio ≥  0.9, PACU phase 1 recovery time, 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  The chi -square statistic  or Fisher’s exact test  will be used to test for a 
treatment effect for postoperative gastrointestinal complications.   
 
We will not conduct an interim analysis since we will need the full sample to evaluate efficacy.  A two -
sided alpha level of 5% will be required for statistical significance.  The statistical software STATA (Stat 
Corporation, College Station, TX) will be u sed for analyses.   
 
Multiplicity  
 This study consists of two treatment groups, no planned interim analysis, a single primary endpoint, and includes a statistical strategy in which a single pre -specified null hypothesis will be tested. Accordingly, 
adjustment for type I error is not require d.  
 
Power/Sample Size:  
 An abstract was published that compared sugammadex with neostigmine for the primary outcome of 
gastric emptying by [CONTACT_523218].
[ADDRESS_679006] deviation of 140 and an area under the curve of 627 mcg*min/ml in the sugammadex group and 548 mcg*min/ml in the neostigmine group, the study require s a sample size of 50 in each group to achieve 80% power at 5% significance level using two -sided 
two-sample t -test.  Ten subjects were added to each group to account for possible dropouts.  
 
Timeline : 
 A review of colorectal surgeries at OHSU in the South Operating Rooms in [ADDRESS_679007] [COMPANY_006] sponsored sugammadex study was 56% (200/358).  Assuming we have a similar enrollment rate we should be able to enro ll 120 subjects in 18 months, with a projected 
enrollment of 1 -2 patients per week.  
 
9. Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Security  
 
The results of the study as well as all other information collected on the data collection sheet will be stored on site at OHSU in the office of the research coordinator .  This office requires a key for entry and 
the corridor to the office requires a passcode for entry.  The office is not shared with any other individuals.  No protected health information or other data collected during the completion of this randomized co ntrolled trial will be taken off campus.  All data gathered for this study will be code d 
before any analysis or publication occurs.  
 
This study number will not contain any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers such as: geographic location, dates related to the individual, medical record number, account numbers, etc.  The key linking study subjects to study code will be kept in a cloud location with special protection for confidential and restricted health

Data collected in the course of the study will be stored using OHSU’s preferred secure database platform 
(Qualtrics) .  Again, this data tool will be only be  made available to study personnel though a secure online 
log-in.  Secure data will be stored in Qualtrics  for indefinite use.  Data in Qualtrics  will be linked only to 
subject study code, not to any of the 18 HIPAA identifiers  
 
In order to maintain patient privacy, data capture tools, study drug accountability records, study reports, and communications will identify the patient only by [CONTACT_44144]. The investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s)  from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory 
authorities access to the patient’s original medical records, including medical history, laboratory studies, and medication administrations, for verification of data gathered and to audit the data collection  
process. This information will be accessed for the duration of the research study, including the follow -
up period, for the purpose of data reconciliation. The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the exte nt permitted by [CONTACT_4913].

11. Risks and Benefits  
a. Risks to Subjects  
 As with all studies, breach of confidentiality is a common risk.  In addition, there is the possibility of slightly increased anxiety on the day of surgery for patients approached for inclusion in the study.  There is also likely to be a loss of free time in the preoperative area as consent will likely take [ADDRESS_679008]- Anesthesia Care Unit 
(PACU), which is not currently standard of care at OHSU.  This TOF ratio may result in a slight discomfort.  Based upon our experience with our previous study involving sugammadex, patients 
do no t remember having their TOF ratio measured.  The TOF ratio will be measured while the 
patient is still under a significant depth of anesthesia.  As data collection will continue to occur throughout the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523202].  
 The orogastric or nasogastric tube is part of the standard anesthesia pathway for colorectal 
surgery. Accordingly, no additional risk is incurred by [CONTACT_28224].  The decision regarding 
removing the gastric tube or leaving it in after surgery will be left to the discretion of the surgical 
team.   
 Large bore peripheral IV access and arterial line insertion are common procedures in the South Operating Rooms (High Risk Surgical Suite).  For most patients having colorectal surgery in the South Operating Rooms the lines placed to ensure safe delivery of anesthetic care will suffice for 
postoperative blood sampling. If blood sampling cannot occur through the lines placed for surgery the least invasive method of obtaining blood samples will be used.  This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_523203] a new large bore peripheral IV.

Sugammadex is a novel method of reversing neuromuscular relaxant in the operating room approved by [CONTACT_90836] 15, 2015.  There is a history of safe Sugammadex use in Europe since its initial approval by [CONTACT_523219] 29, 2008. As Suga mmadex is a 
newer drug in the [LOCATION_002] there is a possibility of unknown or understated adverse events associated with its use.  To this extent adverse experience reporting will include monitoring for and publishing the occurrence of any of the following adverse events associated with sugammadex or neostigmine administration:  
 
Adverse experience reporting will include monitoring for and publishing the occurrence of any of the following adverse events associated with sugammadex or neostigmine administration:  
 
 
1. In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]  
2. Drug hypersensitivity reaction defined by [CONTACT_288881], urticaria, new edema, sudden hypotension 
or tachycardia, or wheezing within [ADDRESS_679009] for participating in this study.  
 Sugammadex, acetaminophen, neostigmine, and glycopyrrolate are regularly handled by [CONTACT_16826].  There is no additional risk to anesthesia providers that participate in this trial.    There is no risk to family of patients that participate in this trial.  
  b. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
  We are performing this study because the incidence of postoperative ileus after colorectal 
surgery has been reported to be 10 -25%.  Return of bowel function is of utmost importance in 
avoiding patient discomfort, morbidity, and mortality after colorectal s urgery.  Whether the 
study drug is better than the current standard of care at promoting return of bowel function is 
unknown.  We anticipate that patients that receive Sugammadex will have faster gastric emptying, shorter phase 1 recovery length of stay, s horter length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and lower 
incidence of postoperative gastrointestinal complications including: anastomotic leak, postoperative ileus, reoperation, and organ space infection —compared to glycopyrrolate and 
neostigmine.

12. Drugs or Devices  (delete if not applicable)  
  
We request that sugammadex be provided by [CONTACT_44873] & Co. as it was for our last trial. We request 80 vials of open label 200 mg/[ADDRESS_679010] person can be shared at a future date.  Individual vials can be sent, i.e. bulk supplies are not needed. The research pharmacy will be responsible for maintaining the inventory of sugammadex, safely and properly storing sugammadex in a secure location, and dispensing sugammadex solely for the purpose of completing the study protocol. Accurate records of sugammadex quantities drawn up, administered, wasted, and disposed of at the end of the study will be kept by [CONTACT_56636].  Any unused sugammadex (either left over after patient administration or at the conclusion of the study) will be destroyed at OHSU pursuant to ICH/GCP guidelines, city of Portland regulations, state of Oregon regulations, federal policy, and OHSU institutional policy.  
 Blinding of sugammadex will not be necessary because the anesthesia provider will not be masked.  The vials of sugammadex will be delivered unchanged to the anesthesia provider with the exception of a bright orange circular label that will identify the drug for research purposes only.  The anesthesia 
provider will be responsible for checking, drawing up, labeling and administering sugammadex safely.   Paracetamol is available at our institution and we intend to purchase it for the study.  The research pharmacy will similarly be responsible for maintaining paracetamol inventory, safely and properly storing paracetamol in a secure location, and dispensing  paracetamol solely for the purpose of 
completing the study protocol. Accurate records of paracetamol quantities drawn up, administered, wasted, and disposed of at the end of the study will be kept by [CONTACT_56636].  Any unused paracetamol (either left over after patient administration or at the conclusion of the study) will be destroyed at OHSU pursuant to ICH/GCP guidelines, city of Portland regulations, state of Oregon regulations, federal policy, and OHSU institutional policy.  
 Blinding of paracetamol will not be necessary.  Paracetamol will be prepared for administration in the research pharmacy.  One gram of paracetamol will be dissolved in [ADDRESS_679011].  
 The TwitchView  electromyography is a device for measuring degree of neuromuscular bloc kade during 
surgery and in the acute postoperative period.  The TwitchView allows for a more accurate assessment of neuromuscular function than the clinical observation of muscle function when using a peripheral nerve stimulator. A price quote has been obtained from the company that produces the TwitchView and 
STIM Bowel Function  
IRB #[ADDRESS_679012] 6 months  would be 
used for the following: obtaining IRB approval, obtaining study drugs, setting up the research 
pharmacy account, developi[INVESTIGATOR_523204], 
training research assistants on use of the TwitchView electromyograph, educating anesthesia providers, educating surgery providers, educating PACU nursing staff, and setting up a database.  The next 18 months would be used for patient recruitment, patient enrollment, study implementation, data collection, and databas e creation.  The final 6 months would be spent on 
data synthesis, statistical analysis, interpretation, writing, and revising the study for publication.

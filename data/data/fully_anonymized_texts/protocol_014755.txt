A.1     Title   
Addressing Obesity to Reduce Cancer Risk and Health Disparities in Rural Ohio: Home-based Exercise in 
Rural Ohio (HERO)  Study  
 
A.2 Overview  
Home -based Exercise in Rural Ohio  (HERO) is a  single-blind, 2-arm randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_163300] a 15- week telephone-based weight loss intervention with tailored 
strategies for rural populations with a novel point-of-care approach to assess body  composition, lipid profiles, 
and inflammatory markers. Up to 50 overweight or obese rural Ohio residents will be randomly assigned to a 15-
week telephone-based weight loss  (n=30) or an active control group (up to 20). We will utilize a novel, portable 
3D optical imaging technology to overcome the lack of access to body composition measures through DXA. 
Together with lipid profiles measured by [CONTACT_163314], this study will establish a practical point- of-care approach to assess disease risk factors that could be 
implemented in rural community settings. Upon completion of this study, we will determine the feasibility and 
preliminary efficacy of a 15-week telephone- based exercise and diet intervention for weight loss and 
improvements in body composition and inflammation biomarkers among overweight and obese rural residents. 
Studying the dose-response relationship will allow us to understand the therapeutic effect of weight loss 
interventions and cancer risk, which has the potential to identify optimal lifestyle modifications to reduce obesity -
related cancer disparities. Findings from our study would provide evidence of the efficacy and therapeutic effect of weight loss interventions in cancer prevention in rural populations.  
 
A.[ADDRESS_189615] been implemented and showed health benefits, these programs focused on health-promoting resources available in urban areas. Generalizing such programs to rural populations is not feasible due to the limited access 
to recreation facilities, availability of healthy food, and the burden of travel. Additionally, rural residents  differ from 
urban counterparts in terms of barriers, self-efficacy, and social support for health behaviors due to their unique personal  (e.g., family roles, living priorities) and environmental  (e.g., limited resources for self-health) factors. 
Therefore, the development of tailored lifestyle interventions to meet the specific needs of rural populations can facilitate the improvement of health behaviors and ultimately reduce cancer -related health disparities.  
To achieve our long term goal of integrating lifestyle modifications to reduce cancer risk and related disparities 
for rural populations, understanding the underlying biological mechanism of weight loss, body composition, and 
inflammation is critical. However, empi[INVESTIGATOR_163301]. Among completed or recently awarded trials  (as of January 2020) , 
none measured body composition and inflammation markers. Estimating the effect of lifestyle interventions on weight loss, body composition, and disease risk factors  (inflammatory markers, lipid profiles) in rural populations 
is essential for the design and implementation of evidenc e-based approaches on a larger scale.  
This study will recruit up to 50 obese rural Ohio residents and randomly assigned to a 15-week telephone-based 
weight loss  (n=30) or an active control group (up to 20). The study objective is to determine the feasibility and 
preliminary efficacy of a 15-week telephone-based weight loss intervention on weight, body composition, and inflammatory markers, with tailored strategies and group messages  to address barriers, self-efficacy, and social 
support for rural Ohio populations. We will utilize a novel and applicable point-of-care approach to assess body 
 
 5  Version 1. Mar 2021 composition, lipid profiles, and cancer risk factors in rural community settings. The Specific Aims for this study 
are: 
1. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 15-week telephone- based weight loss intervention 
among obese rural residents.  
We hypothesize that 80% of obese rural residents who participate in the study will complete the assigned intervention  (feasibility ), and 80% of the participants in the intervention group will engage in at least 75% 
of the weekly telephone counseling session (acceptability ). During the 15-week weight loss intervention, 
we anticipate the minimal occurrence of intervention-related adverse events.  
 
2. To estimate the preliminary efficacy of the lifestyle modifications on weight loss, body composition (fat 
mass, fat percentage), inflammatory biomarkers  (IL-6, TNF-α , and CRP), and other disease risk factors  
(lipid profiles).  
We hypothesize that the lifestyle intervention will result in substantial improvements in weight loss, fat 
mass, fat percentage, IL -6, TNF-α , CRP, and lipid profiles  (with moderate effect size), compared to the 
active control group.   
 
B BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
B.1 Literature Review/Current State of Knowledge   
Rural residents experience obesity -related disparities, including high rates of obesity, obesity -related 
comorbidities, cancer incidence, and premature mortality. Although evidence-based weight loss interventions 
have demonstrated health benefits in clinical settings, utilizing the same strategies may not be feasible and 
effective for rural populations due to their unique characteristics. This study aims to determine the feasibility and 
preliminary efficacy of a 15-week telephone-based lifestyle intervention combining exercise and diet for weight loss and improvement in body composition and inflammation biomarkers in overweight and obese rural 
populations.  
 This project is well -aligned with the mission of the American Institute for Cancer Research (funding agency)  and 
its special Cancer Prevention Research Priority as it will address how lifestyle modifications  (physical activity 
and dietary restriction) can reduce cancer risk  (e.g., inflammation biomarkers) through improvements in weight 
and body composition in rural populations. The following sections summarize the obesity problem in rural 
populations , past studies examining obesity, weight loss, and cancer risks, and the novelty of utilizing a point -of-
care approach to assess body composition and cancer risk factors in rural populations.   
 
B.1.a Magnitude of the problem  
Health disparities in rural populations are significant. About 97% of the U.S land is located in rural counties, and 
60 million Americans live in these areas  (1). Residents in rural areas are considered underserved populations 
with lower access and fewer resources to health care, and experience higher rates of obesity, obesity -related 
comorbidities and mortality, and higher cancer incidence and mortality, compared to residents in urban areas  (2-
5). Although many of the social determinants of health (e.g., low income/education, lack of health insurance) are 
linked to health disparities, obesity and poor health behaviors are the major modifiable contributors to health 
disparities in rural populations  (6-10). Developi[INVESTIGATOR_163302] -related cancer risk in rural populations is an important public health priority.  
 
B.1.b  Obesity and cancer  
Obesity is the leading preventable cause of cancer  (11). Each year more than 1,600,000 people are diagnosed 
with cancer and more than 600,000 people will die from cancer in the U.S  (12). Approximately 40% of cancer 
cases and 14-20% of cancer -specific deaths are attributed to overweight and obesity  (13). Obesity leads to 
abnormal and excessive adiposity accumulation, which negatively impacts metabolic and inflammatory 
processes that promote cell growth, carcinogenesis, and tumor promotion (14-18). Additionally, the dysfunctional 
adipose tissue promotes tumor progression and metastasis  (17, 19). Due to these unfavorable physiological 
modifications, obesity elevates the risk of 13 cancers  (17, 20 -23).  
 
 6  Version 1. Mar 2021 Obesity -related inflammation is linked to elevated cancer risk, independent of obesity itself (24). The 
accumulation of adipose tissue due to obesity produces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6  (IL-6 ), 
tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α), and C -reactive protein ( CRP ), which subsequently affect multiple systemic 
processes and promotes various aspects of tumor growth, development, and metastasis  (25). IL-6, a cytokine 
that produced up to 35% by [CONTACT_163315], is involved in the development and growth of a variety of cancers 
through the STAT3 pathway by [CONTACT_163316], survival, migration, and angiogenesis  (26-
28). Elevated IL-6 is observed in several cancers  (e.g., breast, colon, gastrointestinal tract, lung, ovary) and is 
correlated with cancer prognosis  (29-35). TNF-α controls inflammatory cell proliferation and mediates many 
aspects of the inflammatory process, such as regulating cytokines, 
chemokines, adhesions, and pro-angiogenic activities  (36, 37). Similar 
to IL-6, TNF-α  stimulates proliferation, survival, migration, and 
angiogenesis in most cancer cells, leading to tumor promotion (38). 
CRP, an acute-phase protein produced in the liver and controlled by [CONTACT_8668]-
6 and TNF- α, is a stable downstream marker of systemic inflammation 
(39-41). Circulating CRP is positively associated with risks of cancers 
in the breast, colon, liver, lung, bladder, kidney, endometrium, and 
ovary  (42-47). The dysregulation of these cytokines leads to 
inflammation in both local  (tissue) and global  (circulating in serum) 
levels, which promotes tumor growth  (48).   
 
B.1.c Weight loss and cancer risk 
Weight loss may reverse obesity -related metabolic imbalances and 
chronic inflammation (49-54) . Obesity -related cancer risk could be 
reduced in response to weight loss as a result of improved inflammatory 
profile (55) (Figure 1). Accumulating evidence indicates that a period 
of weight loss improves obesity -related inflammation markers, such as 
IL-6, TNF-α , and CRP (56-62) . While increasing physical activity level 
alone could lead to a substantial decrease in TNF-α , lifestyle 
interventi ons that combine physical activity and dietary modification can 
produce a 24-31% decrease in TNF-α , 34-44% decrease in CRP, and 33-62% in IL-6 (58-62). Lifestyle weight 
loss interventions provide additional metabolic benefits on insulin, lipid profiles, and improvements in body composition  (63-67). These outcomes are consistent with the hypotheses  that weight loss, physical activity, and 
healthy diet may potentially attenuate the negative effects of obesity and reduce cancer risk  and premature 
mortality  (68-70).  
 
B.1.d Weight loss in rural populations  
Evidence-based lifestyle weight loss interventions have been implemented and demonstrated favorable results in clinical settings targeting populations with various diseases (e.g., cancer, type II diabetes, hypertension)  (71-
82). These programs focused on and utilized resources in urban areas . To utilize the same intervention strategies 
from these programs may not be feasible and effective for rural populations to lose weight due to their unique personal  (e.g., family roles, living priorities) and environmental  (e.g., limited resources) factors  (83-85). Barriers 
to healthy diet and the lack of recreation facilities explain variations in health behaviors in rural populations. These populations also have lower self-efficacy in healthy diet and exercise (i.e., belief of the ability to eat healthy/exercise when there are barriers), and minimal social support from family and friends to promote healthy lifestyle (83- 85). Individuals with lower self-efficacy and social support are less likely to overcome barriers to 
achieve improvement in health behaviors  (86). Self-efficacy and social support are critical in successful weight 
loss efforts by [CONTACT_163317], setting goals, establishing healthy dietary habits, increasing daily physical activity, and persistence in overcoming barriers  (87, 88) . However, tailored strategies to improve self-
efficacy and social support for rural populations are understudied. Moreover, although remotely accessible 
interventions are suggested to achieve more weight loss with better cost-effectiveness than face-to-face interventions in rural areas  (89, 90), web-based interventions have not provided clinically meaningful weight loss  
(91). Therefore, the proposed study, HERO,  will include a telephone-based weight loss intervention, specifically 
focused on improving self-efficacy and increasing social support to help rural populations overcome barriers, 

 
 7  Version 1. Mar 2021 improve healthy diet and physical activity, and maintain a healthy weight, with the goal of reducing obesity -
related cancer risk and health disparities.   
 
B.1.e  A Point -of-care Approach to Assess Body Composition and Cancer Risk in Rural 
Populations 
The significance of the HERO  study is enhanced by [CONTACT_163318] a more applicable point-of-care 
approach to assess body composition, lipid profiles, and cancer risk factors in rural populations, in addition to 
translating an evidence- based lifestyle program with the integration of tailored strategies. Body mass index  (BMI) 
is limited as a measure of adiposity, as it does not truly reflect body fat and fat distribution (92).  Measures of 
body fat are more relevant to assessing cancer risk, as adiposity deposition is associated with inflammation and 
carcinogenesis  (93, 94) . Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry  (DXA) is a standard measure of body composition 
that provides estimates of fat, bone, and bone-free lean mass  (95). DXA -derived fat mass is positively associated 
with risk of breast cancer, independent of BMI and other risk factors  (96-99). Rural populations may differ from 
the general population in the physiological response to lifestyle interventions due to variations in perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and other life stressors. However, among the handful of lifestyle weight loss interventions in rural populations, completed or recently awarded trials, none measured body composition (91, 
100). This might be due to the access burden of standard measurement of body composition (e.g., DXA) in rural 
community settings. In order to provide body composition measures for rural populations, the HERO study will 
use a novel, portable 3- Dimension (3D) Body Scanner, Styku S100 (Styku  LLC, Los Angeles, CA), to assess 
body measurements, including fat mass and fat percentage, in rural community -settings. Together with lipid 
profile measured by [CONTACT_163319], the proposed study will provide preliminary data from a lifestyle weight loss intervention on weight, body composition, and 
inflammatory markers in rural populations. We will estimate the preliminary efficacy of lifestyle modification on 
weight loss, body composition, and inflammatory markers among overweight/obese rural residents. Findings from the HERO study will serve as preliminary data for a large-scale randomized controlled trial to quantify the 
therapeutic effect of weight loss interventions and cancer risk in rural populati ons, with the goal to identify optimal 
lifestyle modifications to reduce obesity -related cancer disparities.  
 
B.[ADDRESS_189616] focused on disease prevention and health promotion in various populations. The current and previous NIH funded randomized controlled weight loss trials  (Comprehensive Lifestyle 
Intervention Program for Knee Osteoarthritis Patients, 
R01AG050725; Feasibility of An Exercise and Dietary Intervention 
in Me n on Prolonged Androgen Deprivation Therapy, IDEA -P trial; 
R03CA16296901) have demonstrated a strong interdisciplinary team with extensive experience in design/delivery of weight loss program  (Figure 2). The Co-I of this proposed project, [CONTACT_163351] tt, is a nationally recognized investigator in health disparities. 
Her research with underserved populations established the expertise and capability to conduct studies in disease prevention, health disparities, and improving access in underserved areas, including a faith-based weight loss program in Appalachian states  
(The Walk by [CONTACT_163320]; U54 CA153604) and the Rural Interventions for Screening Effectiveness  (RISE; R01 
CA196243). The RISE Project recruited [ADDRESS_189617] rural Ohio, and 330 had a BMI≥ 25 kg/m
2. We anticipate at least 40% of these participants would 
be willing to participate in this study.      

 
 8  Version 1. Mar 2021 C RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
C.1  Overall strategy.   
This study is a single-blind, 2-arm randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_163303] a 15-week telephone-based weight loss in obese rural populations. Up to 50 obese rural 
Ohio residents will be randomly assigned to a 15-week telephone-based weight loss group ( n=30) or active 
control group (up to 20). The primary outcome of this trial is the feasibility of a 15-week telephone- based weight 
loss intervention. The exploratory outcomes include changes in weight, body composition, lipid profiles, and 
inflammatory markers  (CRP, IL -6, and TNF-α). Exploring the efficacy of the telephone-based intervention on 
weight loss, body composition, lipid profiles, and inflammatory markers will provide preliminary effect estim ates 
for future larger-scale randomized controlled trial in rural populations.

C.2.b  Research team training 
Prior to the initiation of the project, all research  staff will receive standardized training to ensure that the activities 
of the study are conducted in a uniform, safe, confidential and secure manner. All r esearch staff will attend a one 
hour long training using slides and manuals developed for prior studies and will be modified for the current study. Contents covered in the training session will include: 1) overview of study objectives; 2) description of study groups and interventions; 3) protection of human  subjects,  HIPAA,  and  confidentiality  issues;  4)  cultural  sensitivity;  5)  roles  and  responsibilities; 6)  documentation  and  reporting  requirements;  7)  data  monitoring  
 
 9  Version 1. Mar 2021 and  quality  assurance  procedures; 8) handling problems/questions during recruitment/data collection; 9) 
effective communication techniques; and 10) use of the REDCap for data entry.  
 The success of a weight loss intervention is dependent upon the health coaches’ ability  to communicate with a 
wide range of people and in the culturally accepted vernacular. Personal skills such as the ability to be empathetic, patient, and caring are important when it comes to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_163304]. Health coaches trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Focht in exercise physiology and behavioral change, and have experience in weight loss trials will deliver the intervention to participants. All health coaches will take a refresher training before study started. The refresher training will include information about concept and 
strategies of behavioral intervention, principle and goals of physical activity and dietary modification, and ways 
to overcome barriers to behavioral change. Health coaches will also be trained in communication, consistency, and collaboration in the rural community and cultural setting.  
 In addition  to the one-hour training, research staff will be trained using standard protocols for assessments, 
including measuring weight, height through scales, body  composition via 3D body scanner, and timed fitness 
performance. In terms of colleting blood samples, research staff will be trained to use finger stick using Cholestech LDX. Only research staff who are certified phlebotomists will conduct blood draw. Following the 
training session, research staff will role-play and receive feedback until they have reached 100% compliance with recruitment, assessment, and data collection integrity.  
 
C.3 Study Population  
C.3.a  Rural  Ohio  
Within Ohio, 50 of the total 88 counties  (56.8%) are considered rural according to Rural -Urban Continuum Codes 
(RUCC).  These counties  have a population of about 2.[ADDRESS_189618] of whom are Caucasian. Our study will 
target adults 20-64 years old who reside in rural Ohio counties. We will enroll up to 50 adults 20-64 years  of age 
in the designated counties .  
 
C.3.b Eligibility Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria: 1) BMI≥ 25kg/m2; 2) Age ≥20 years  and <65 years; 3) Not currently participating in any weight 
loss intervention or meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  (150 min/week of moderate-
intensity exercise or 75 min/week of vigorous exercise); 4) Ability to walk two city blocks  (about 400 steps) 
comfortably ; and 5) Ability to speak and read English.  
 
Exclusion Criteria: 1) Prior cancer diagnosis  (except non-mela noma skin cancer)  or severe medical conditions 
such as unstable cardiovascular disease or digestive disorders that would preclude physical  activity and dietary 
intervention; 2) pregnant or nursing women (if one becomes pregnant over the course of the study, she will be 
asked to report to research staff); and 3) u nable to give informed consent. 
 Potential participants will be screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_163321] . To determine whether an 
interested individual should consult with his or her physician before beginning an exercise program, potential 
participants who self-reported to have pre-existing health conditions  (e.g., heart problems, insulin-dependent 
diabetes, poorly controlled blood pressure, other severe disease)  will be asked to  obtain medical clearance 
before enrollment. For potential participants who self-reported any health condition that may preclude them from 
the exercise/dietary modification (e.g., poorly controlled blood pressure, insulin-dependent diabetes, any heart disease, or any other severe disease), we will ask their permission to contact [CONTACT_163322]. Their physicians must  fax, email or mail  a medical clearance form  (see 10. Medical Clearance Form) 
to OSU by [CONTACT_163323]. If physicians indicated the 
participant is not eligible for our study, we will contact [CONTACT_163324]/email to inform their ineligibility 
(see 1d. Not eligible from physician clearance).  
 
Eligible participants will be grouped by [CONTACT_163325]  (e.g., county, geographic region) to schedule in-
person assessments  (baseline and 15-week). To optimize retention and maintain data fidelity, all assessments 
 
 10  Version 1. Mar 2021 will be obtained on-site at communi ty locations  (e.g., library, Area Health Education Center) close to participants ' 
homes by [CONTACT_3665].  
 
C.3.c Recruitment  
We will recruit  up to 50 overweight/obese rural residents through social media (i.e., Facebook ), flyers, and a list 
of participants from a previous study  (The RISE Project). We anticipate to screen 9-15 individuals per week and 
recruit 4-5 participants per month. 
 
C.3.d Randomization  
Participants will be randomized to either the weight loss intervention group (Telephone- based health counselling)  
or the active control group (Health education)  using block randomization in 4-[ADDRESS_189619], participants will be assigned to either weight 
loss (n=30) or active control group (up to 20 participants) .  
 
C.3.e Informed consent process  
After confirming eligibility for the trial, each participant will be given a unique study number. The research staff (see table 1 for details) will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and answer all the candidate’s 
questions regarding the study.  The individual will be asked to provide written informed consent to participate in 
the study. If an eligible participant refuses to provide written consent, the research staff will not proceed with the baseline assessment. The research staff will follow talking points that will outline all of the requirements of the 
study and will cover the content of the informed consent form. The participants  will be  given a copy of the 
informed consent document for their records and afforded the opportunity to ask questions and have them 
answered to their satisfaction. Once the individual fully understands each element of the consent and the study, 
including the purpose, requirements, risks, confidentiality, right to withdraw, and contact [CONTACT_9702], then he/she will 
be asked to provide consent. The screening process will take approximately 5 minutes, and the informed consent 
process could take up to 15 minutes to complete. 
 
The consent process will be documented in detail including any questions asked by [CONTACT_163326]. The research staff will date and sign the documentation. In addition, the 
time the consent process began and ended will also be documented. Prior to the beginning the baseline 
assessment, participants will be asked once again if they understand the requirements of the study and if they 
wish to continue. Any subsequent changes to the informed consent process will be submitted to the OSU IRB 
for approval pri or to activation.  
 Participants assigned to the weight loss group will notify the research study staff of any pre-existing medical 
conditions, including injuries  and recent surgeries, at baseline before they start the weight loss intervention and 
will inform the research study staff should they experience any medical problems, including injuries, over the 
course of the weight loss program. Their responses at baseline and throughout the weight loss intervention  will 
be recorded on an Adverse Events Log.  
 
C.4 Weight Loss Intervention  
C.4.a Overview  
The proposed weight loss intervention is a 15-week telephone-
based, multi -component approach adapted from the Healthy 
Living and Eating Program  (73), which was designed for 
cancer patients. We will modify the program from the in-person 
group sessions to a remotely accessible telephone-based 
intervention to reduce the burden of travel for rural  populations 
and transform  the program from a cancer patient’s focus to one 
of a general population with obesity. Participants randomized 

 
 11  Version 1. Mar 2021 to the weight loss group will receive weekly telephone sessions led by [CONTACT_163327] a background in 
exercise physiology and behavioral weight loss interventions for 15 weeks to achieve a 7% weight loss goal. Participants will be encouraged to lose weight through a modest restriction in caloric intake (500-1000kcal/day) that gradually progresses towards a personalized, target daily  caloric intake goal  (1200-1800 kcal/day) and 
concomitant increase in energy expenditure via physical activity including aerobic exercise and resistance training (Table 2). Participants will be asked to self-monitor dietary intake and physical activity through a paper  
food log or MyFitnessPal on a daily basis. They will also receive a lifestyle modification manual  (will be submitted 
in the first amendment) based on the Health Living and Eating Program and the Look AHEAD study to guide 
behavioral changes with weekly goals
  (73, 101) .  
 
C.4.b Dietary Component  
During the weekly telephone session, participants will receive dietary recommendations tailored to their current weight and weight loss target. The specific dietary objectives will be consistent with recommendations from the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR)  (102) . The AICR nutrition guidelines were selected to be 
implemented in the dietary portion of the intervention because: a) of their value for offsetting adverse changes in body weight, body composition, and metabolic and inflammatory markers; b) they are the most 
comprehensive, scientifically -based cancer prevention guidelines available; and c) the education materials 
available from AICR in support of their guidelines are clear, easy -to-follow and very consumer -friendly.   
 
The dietary intervention encourages reductions in portion size and caloric and fat consumption together with a gradual transition from an animal -based diet to a more plant-rich diet while still incorporating animal foods, 
including milk and meat, with an emphasis on monitoring food proportion and portion size. Specifically, the dietary component includes: 1) reduction in energy intake by 500-1000 kcal per day; 2) reduction in total fats to 25-30%, saturated fats to 7%, and protein to 15% of total calories; 3) increase in fruit and vegetable consumption to 5 servings per day; 4) intake of [ADDRESS_189620] 25 grams of dietary fiber per day, and 5) increase water intake.  
 The weekly intervention on dietary intake will use a motivational interviewing approach.  This technique has been extensively used in substance abuse counseling and recently, has been applied to diet-related behavior change. Motivational interviewing has been demonstrated to be an effective communication method to promote behavior change in various populations  (103, 104). Additionally, participants will receive tailored dietary strategies built 
upon many of the cognitive -behavioral self- management techniques utilized in the behavioral exercise 
counseling component, including self-monitoring, building self-efficacy, goal setting, and anticipating and overcoming barriers to dietary behavior change. Dietary consultations will be provided by a registered dietitian to participants, as needed.   
C.4.c Physical activity component  
A combination of home-based aerobic and resistance exercise will be described through a lifestyle modification 
manual and telephone counseling. The goal of physical activity will be to achieve 150 -200 min/week moderate-
intensity aerobic physical activity and 2-3 sessions/week resistance training. The aerobic physical activity 
consists of gradually progressing from 10-[ADDRESS_189621], if not all days of the week, with a primary focus placed upon brisk walking as the primary accessible mode of aerobic exercise for each participant. However, participants are encouraged to engage in their preferred choice of exercise mode that they are able  
and willing to perform including brisk walking, running, or cycling. The home-based resistance exercise involves 
performing 1-3 sets of 8RM-12RM repetitions of various exercises  (e.g., sit-to-stand, standing leg curl, seated 
leg extension, chest press, lateral raise, bent-over row, straight-arm pulldown, arm curl, triceps pushdown, and 
chair abdominal curls) using body weights and resistance bands  (see exercise manual). All exercise 
prescriptions were appropriately modified for safe and effective home-based exercise.   
During the telephone counseling in the first two weeks, health coaches will go through the exercises described 
in the lifestyle modification manual with each participant, and if needed, modifications of the exercises will be provided. Participants will be provided an exercise manual and access to online YouTube videos  (as another 
option)  that demonstrate safe, effective techniques for each of the prescribed exercises, provide examples for 
 
 [ADDRESS_189622] been 
successfully implemented to facilitate home-based exercise in prior lifestyle interventions led by [CONTACT_20685]. Each week participants will gradually increase their exercise duration and intensity in increments of 10- 30 
min until attaining the target physical activity volume goal. 
C.4.d Behavioral component  
Each week, participants will receive a 30-45 minute telephone counseling session that provides behavioral change techniques tailored to rural populations using the contemporary principles of cultural -tailoring and Social 
Cognitive Theory  (105) , and focus on motivation, relapse prevention, emotional distress, time management, and 
overcoming barriers. Each session will include a review of the previous week’s activity, planned weekly les sons, 
dietary and exercise goals for the subsequent week, and strategies tailored to each participant to improve self -
efficacy, social support, and overcome barriers. Additionally, group messages following the weekly telephone counseling is integrated with the behavioral component to promote independent adherence to lifestyle 
modification.  
 Participants will also receive a physical activity tracker  (e.g., Fitbit) and a weight scale. Participants will learn 
how to use the Fitbit and will wear it during the entire study period. Participants will learn how to conduct self-
measurements and record body weight each week, as well as set up MyFitnessPal  (or using paper log)  to self-
monitor dietary intake and physical activity throughout the 15-week study period.  
 The objective of the behavioral component is to promote increased self- efficacy and social support for lifestyle 
modifications and gradually facilitate participants’ transition toward successful independent self- regulation of a 
healthy diet and physical ac tivity. The behavioral component focuses upon the acquisition and practice of self-
regulatory skills in conjunction with a continuous problem-solving model  of behavior change to empower 
participants to exert greater control over their behavior, cognition, and environment. The behavioral component is designed to: a) increase health knowledge of the benefits of physical activity and dietary modifications; b) enhance self-efficacy and positive outcome expectancies through the promotion of a series of successful 
experiences in changing exercise and eating behavior; and c) improving self-regulation of exercise and eating 
behaviors through the use of goal -setting, self-monitoring, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, and barrier 
problem -solving strategies . The efficacy of this approach for promoting adoption and maintenance of exercise 
and dietary behavior change has been demonstrated in prior randomized controlled trials that [CONTACT_163352] has served as principal and co-investigator on other studies   (106-109) . 
 
C.5 Active Control Group 
At the beginning of the study, participants randomized to the active control arm will receive education brochures  
(will be submitted in the first amendment)  describing the American Institute for Cancer Research physical activity 
and dietary guidelines. Participants will be asked to meet the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  
(150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 min/week of vigorous exercise), and increase fruit and vegetable intake, reduce fat intake, reduce sugary drink, increase consumption of whole grain, and increase 
water intake . An exercise manual with access Online YouTube videos (as another option) will be available as 
examples  for proper exercise form for strength training.
 We will also encourage them to self-monitor weight, 
dietary intake, and physical activity through MyFitnessPal  or paper log. To achieve the retention and provide 
motivation and strategies  for behavioral change in the active control group, participants will receive a Fitbit and 
the lifestyle modification manual at the end of the study.  
  
C.6 Covid- 19 Safety Protocols and Planning 
In order to minimize risk of exposure in research activities conducted during the COVID -19 pandemic, w e will be 
using multiple strategies that align with OSU Office of Research recommendations included in the Staged Reopening Plan guidance including: a) Promote healthy hygiene practices including frequent and thorough hand washing and hand sanitizer; b) Maintain recommended social distancing during all in-person research assessments; c) Limit personnel to no more than 1 person per 150 sq ft; d) Staggered scheduling of research 
staff and assessment visits will be enacted to maintain social distancing protocols; e) Assessment visits will be 
scheduled in a manner that limits the amount of time spent on campus or in the field to absolute minimum needed 
 
 [ADDRESS_189623], during the ongoing 
pandemic, in-person contacts are limited to outcome assessments which significantly reduces time spent in the labs and/or field settings by [CONTACT_163328]. Self-report measures will be completed via virtual and/or mail to reduce in-person contact [CONTACT_5586]; f) PPE including masks, face shields, and gloves will be worn during 
contact [CONTACT_163329]; Homemade or cloth masks are accepted; g) Use of a Daily symptom log for all participants and personnel - fever of 100.[ADDRESS_189624] been exposed within the recent 14 days should stay home and call PCP; h) Clean and disinfect using approved disinfectant cleaners for all lab/office surfaces that require contact (desk, keyboard, ipads,  doors, 
etc) before and after each required activity in assessment visits ; i) Personnel must remove one glove when 
opening doors, pushing elevator buttons, etc to avoid cross contamination; j) Our designated investigative team 
will coordinate all scheduling and oversight of research activities in consultation with PI ([CONTACT_163356]) to reduce overlap of researchers in a given space; j) Log time of entry, time of departure, and temperature; and k) 
Participants will not have anyone accompany them to assessments unless they require assistance . 
 
C.7 Assessment  
Outcome assessments will be obtained at baseline and 15  week s later at in-person visits by [CONTACT_163330]. All outcome assessments will be conducted at a community center  or 
public location convenient to the participant. Each outcome measure will be collected through paper or online survey  (through REDCap) and store d in REDCap  (Research Electronic Data Capture) .  
C.7.a Primary O utcome: feasibility and acceptability  
Completion rate and participation of the weekly telephone counseling session will be measured to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the 15- week  telephone-based weight loss intervention. 
 
C.7.b Secondary Outcome Assessment

 14  Version 1. Mar 2021 1. Anthropometric assessment  
Body weight (kg) and height (cm) will be measured to calculate BMI (kg/m2).  
 
2. Body composition  
Fat mass  (kg), fat%, lean mass  (kg), lean% will be measured using a 3-Dimension (3D) Body Scanner, Styku 
S100 (Styku  LLC, Los Angeles, CA). The Styku S100 scanner uses an infrared camera built into a tower and a 
rotating platform to capture body circumference and 
volumes. Participants will stand on the platform with their arms positioned in the A-pose and then will be r otated 
clockwise. The Styku S100 scanner uses Microsoft Kinect Fusion software to recognize body landmarks, which are 
used to calculate and visualize various body measurements  
(110) . The Styku S100 scanner produced reliable 
measures of body composition compared with dual -energy 
X-ray absorptiometry  (Figure 3). Most importantly, the 
Styku S100 scanner is feasible to use in rural community -
settings because of its portable size and ease of assembling (Figure 4).   
 
3. Hydration  
Proper hydration is critical for collecting blood samples through finger stick and venipuncture. In 
addition, inflammatory markers are sensitive to hydration status. Therefore, to ensure proper hydration, participants will be asked to consume 2 cups of water the night before the assessment and another 2 cups the morning of the assessment. Urine samples will be checked for urine -specific 
gravity  (USG) using a refractometer . A USG<1.025 indicates euhydration.   
 
4. Lipid profile  
Total cholesterol  (TC) , triglycerides  (TG), high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol  (HDL -C), and low -density lipoprotein 
cholesterol  (LDL -C) will be obtained by [CONTACT_163332][INVESTIGATOR_163305] (Hayward, CA). The Cholestech LDX has demonstrated the accuracy and precision to assess blood lipid  (111, 112). It is a point-of-care assessment to screen 
abnormal blood lipid in clinical, community, and other health 
promotion settings  (113, 114). The Cholestech LDX 
provides lipid profiles result within 5 minutes, which will 
allow research staff and participants to receive results at the same visits.  
 
5. Inflammatory markers  
All participants will undergo a fasting  (≥6 hr) blood draw  (50mL per assessment) . Plasma  samples will be stored 
at -80°C until assayed. C -reactive protein (CRP) concentration (ng/L), Interleukin (IL) -6 concentration (pg/mL), 
and TNF-α  will be quantified with electrochemiluminescent multiplex immunoassay platform (Meso Scale 
Discovery, MSD) .  
 
6. Physical activity  
Objectively -determined minutes of PA participation will be assessed and  The ActivPAL captures free-living 
sedentary and ambulatory PA and is well -established as one of the most accurate wearable activity monitors  

 
 15  Version 1. Mar 2021 (115) . The monitor will be set to collect PA data using the manufacturer settings and is affixed to the midline of 
patients’ right thigh in a waterproof pouch allowing for continuous wear time. Participants will be provided verbal  
and written instructions on how to wear the ActivPAL and wear the monitor [ADDRESS_189625] 10 hours per day  of wear time on 4 days of the week  (including at least 1 weekend day) for a valid 
assessment. Monitors will be returned to trial staff via U.S. postal service.  
 
Participants will also complete self- reported Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaires  (116)  in the 1st and 15th 
week. 
7. Dietary intake 
All participants will complete 7-day food checklist for at the 1st and 15th week. This food checklist was developed 
by [CONTACT_163333] a list of foods. Over the course of a day, participant makes a check beside a food each time she or he eats it. It yields estimates of macro nutrient intake, as well as i ntake by 
[CONTACT_163334] . Participants in the weight loss intervention will also be encouraged to complete daily food 
log using MyFitnessPal (or paper log) during the trial. The food log and weekly summary of caloric and macronutrient intake will be regularly monitored by [CONTACT_20767]’s staff and registered dietitian to track adherence.   
8. Self-Efficacy and Social Support  
Participants will be asked to complete self-reported Healthy Weight and Eating Self- Efficacy, Multi-dimensional 
Self-Efficacy scales  (117-119) , as well as adapted Social Support Inventory for P hysical Activity (SSPA) and 
Eating Habits  (SSEH) questionnaires  (120, 121) .  
 
9. Physical fitness  
Participants will be asked to complete valid and reliable timed performance-related mobility tasks, such as  400-
meter walk  and lift and carry task  (122-125) . These assessments at baseline will serve as a reference to tailor 
exercise counseling for each participant.  
 
C.9. Timeline 
Database development and personnel training will 
occur in the first 2 months of Year 1 (Table 4). 
Participant recruitment, with a target accrual of 4-[ADDRESS_189626] participants from previous research (RISE) to achieve our recruitment goal. Although RISE participants are all women, we anticipate enrolling men by [CONTACT_163335], such as community 
events. As the primary aim of the proposed study is the feasibility, not generalizability, the representation of 
participants’ sex is not our focus.  

 
 [ADDRESS_189627] access to an in-house registered dietitian who will provide participants with resources and strategies 
to optimize their food selections and improve dietary intake as needed. If, during the 15-week intervention, participants experience barriers to exercise facilities, we would expand exercise options, including an exercise 
manual with home-based alternative exercises, and access to online YouTube videos  (as another option) , to 
allow participants to utilize more resources to complete the moderate-intensity exercises.  
C.10.c. Assessment  
We considered using a standard measure of body composition using Dual -energy X-ray absorptiometry  (DXA) 
but opted not to as this is likely to add the burden of travel to facilities equipped with DXA. However, we will 
assess body composition using a 3-D Styku body scanner, which is portable to rural community -settings and can 
provide valid and reliable data on body composition. Together with using Cholestech LDX to evaluate participants’ lipid profiles, the proposed study is innovative to test new point-of-care approaches to assess disease risk factors in rural populations.  
D DATA HANDLING AND ANALYSES  
D.1. Outcome Analysis Plan 
D.1.a  Primary outcome 
The feasibility of completing the study  is defined as the percentage of enrolled participants who complete the 
study. If we observe an 80% completion rate in the weight loss intervention group (n=30), the 85%, 90%, and 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) for the completion rate would be (69.5, 90.5), (68.0, 92.0), and (65.7, 94.3), 
respectively. If the true completion rate is 80%, we have 95% power to rule out the unacceptable 50% completion rate with 95% confidence (one-sided).  
 
The acceptability of the weight loss intervention is the percentage of participants in the weight loss intervention 
group who engage at least 75% of the weekly telephone counseling session. Intervention-related adverse events, satisfactory, and other feasibility assessments, such as the percent of initial contact [CONTACT_163336], reasons for consent refusal, barriers to adherence to weekly goals, and reasons for drop-out will also be assessed.  
 
D.1.b  Secondary outcome 
Significance test for the preliminary efficacy of the lifestyle intervention will quantify the difference in means using repeated measures ana lysis of variance  (ANCOVA) statistical model to adjust baseline values and control for 
the effect of age. The sample size of [ADDRESS_189628] 15 in the active control group is feasible to recruit for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/preliminary efficacy study that accounts for a projected attrition rate of 20% yet also still provides adequate power to detect meaningful, moderate to large effect size (0.54-0.72) on weight 
loss, body composition, inflammatory markers, and lipid pr ofiles.  
 
Analyses will be conducted using the intention to treat principle with last value carried forward approach used to account for data missing due to participant attrition. Exploratory analyses will compare outcomes including weight loss, changes in body composition, changes in physical activity and dietary intake, changes in lipid profiles and 
inflammatory biomarkers between the telephone-based weight loss group and the active control group. We will 
also examine whether social support and self-effic acy changes among participants from the weight loss group. 
These exploratory analyses will provide effect size estimates to inform the development of a large-scale phase 
II randomized controlled lifestyle weight loss intervention trial.  
 
D.2.  Data Management  
As mentioned above, we will use REDCap as our data entry system. It will be used to store the baseline and 
follow -up questionnaires, will work directly with the OSU CCTS Research Informatics Services Core and will be 
 
 17  Version 1. Mar 2021 used as a central location for data processing and management. Vanderbilt University, with collaboration from a 
consortium of institutional partners  (including OSU) and the NIH National Center for Research Resources, has 
developed a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic  collection and management of research 
and clinical trial data. REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study -specific data dictionary defined 
in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_163337]. As part of the data dictionary development process, individual fields can be denoted as “identifiers”. When exporting a de-identified dataset, these variables are omitted. Additionally, the data export tool  also allows shifting of dates for a limited data set export. REDCap provides a secure, web-
based application that is flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research, provides an intuitive 
interface for users to enter data and has real time v alidation rules  (with automated data type and range checks) 
at the time of entry. It offers easy data manipulation with audit trails and ad hoc reporting functionality for 
reporting, monitoring and querying patient records, and an automated export mechanism to common statistical packages  (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S-Plus). REDCap is [ADDRESS_189629] combination. The provisioning of accounts and user access to specific database (s) is integrated with the OSU 
Medical Center LDAP authentication service, and the provisioning of access and specific user rights are 
managed by [CONTACT_163338].   
Each participant will be assigned a unique study ID  (SID) when first recruited that will follow their electronic 
information in REDCap, throughout the study. Each participant will have their own folder that will contain a copy 
of their consent documentation form, any paper format self-reported questionnaires or assessments, Medical 
Clearance (if any), and any letters sent to the participant. The folders will be stored in locked filing cabinets in a locked office. No information about a study participant will be given to third parties unless that subject has given written or witnessed consent to do so.  Information will be obtained and maintained on all individuals screened for this study.  If available we will keep demographic data on those individual who are ineligible and eligible but refuse.  The data will be used to ensure 
that we do not contact [CONTACT_163339].  The data will also be used to characterize/compare this group individual to those who 
are eligible and agree to participate; it is important to determine if those who are ineligible and especially those who refuse to participate, are in way inherently different from the women who participate in the study.    
D.3. Record Retention  
All research records  (including identifying information) will be maintained until data analysis and all manuscripts 
have been completed, or for the length of time designated by [CONTACT_163340] .  
Paper records will be maintained in a secured storage facility and electronic data will be stored in a password protected database until is appropriate to destroy the data.  The IRB at OSU, the NCI, and AICR will be notified 
of our intent to destroy the data. If required by [CONTACT_163341] , de-identified data may be shared with the NCI and 
AICR and their data repositories.  
 
E HUMAN SUBJECTS  
E.1 Anticipated Risks 
There are minimal risks associated with completing the objective and self- report measur es for this study. Possible 
psychological risks may occur in that some individuals may experience some guilt or embarrassment in objectively 
measured body composition and self -reporting low levels of motivation or intention to exercise. Embarrassment or 
discomfort could occur from certain baseline or follow -up survey questions, but participants are able to skip any 
questions that they do not wish to answer. Risks anticipated with receiving the intervention materials (brochures, telephone -based counseling) or encouraging participants to promote healthy lifestyle are minimal. There are minor 
risks associated with venipuncture (taking blood from a vein) including mild discomfort or bruising.  Less commonly, a small clot, swelling of the vein, infection, or bleeding may occur at the site of puncture.  
 There is the possibility of muscle soreness from increased physical activity. The muscle soreness may last several 
days after each exercise session, but it is not likely to be severe enough to limit activities of daily living. There is 
 
 [ADDRESS_189630] participants' personal information. Electronic data will be stored behind a firewall and accessed only by [CONTACT_163342]- protected 
computers. Paper -based data will be stored in a locked cabinet within a locked file room.  
 Collectively, the participants will be assuming no more than minimal risk in completing the assessment protocol and the minimal risk inherent to completing the assessments will be mitigated via stringent pre-test medical screening and during testing supervision.  
 
E.2 Benefits of participation   
Participants may gain awareness of healthy eating and physical activity from evidence-based program. 
Participants  in the telephone-based counseling group will receive a physical activity tracker  (e.g., Fitbit) at the 
beginning of the study , and weekly telephone-based weight loss counselling for 15 weeks . Participants in the 
active control group will also receive a physical activity tracker  and lifestyle modification manual  at the end of the 
study. All participants will receive regular body weight, body composition, and blood tests for lipid profiles and 
inflammatory biomarkers free of charge. 
 
E.3 Adverse events 
Adverse events, including any unfavorable and unintend ed sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding or symptom) 
will be collected as they occur, regardless of whether it is considered related to the weight loss intervention. Musculoskeletal injuries and previously undocumented major medical events incurred during the intervention will be systematically collected on all participants during the study period using standardized forms from our prior 
work. Patients will have instructions to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_163306]. The PI, study coordinator should immediately be contact[CONTACT_163343] a problem 
arises.   
E.3.a Severity 
1) Serious adverse event:  Any adverse event that is fatal or life threatening, is permanently disabling, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908], or results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
2) Life-threatening event:  Any adverse event in which the subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurs; does not include a reaction that, if it occurs in a more serious form, might cause death; 
3) Unexpected event:  Any adverse event that is not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the investigator brochure, study protocol, consent form, or IND application; or the event is more serious than anticipated.  
 
E.3.b Association 
1) Definitely Related:  An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the study 
intervention and follows a known pattern of response for which no alternative cause is present;  
2) Probably Related: An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the study 
intervention and follows a known pattern of response, but for which a potential alternative cause may be present;  
3) Possibly Related: An adverse event that has a timely relationship to the administration of the study 
intervention, follows no known pattern of response, but a potential alternative cause does not exist;  
4) Unrelated:  An adverse event for which there is evidence that it is definitely related to a cause other than the 
study intervention; in general, no timely relationship to the administration of the drug/procedure exists, or if so, the event does not follow a pattern of response and an alternative cause is present. 
 
 
 19  Version 1. Mar 2021 E.3.c Documentation 
The adverse event form will be used by [CONTACT_163344]. The patient will be observed and monitored carefully until the condition resolves, stabilizes, or its cause is identified.  All adverse events, including laboratory abnormalities, will be followed up according to good medical practices. Information to be recorded includes: 1) specific type of reaction; 
2) duration of reaction; 3) severity/grade of reaction according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE); 4) suspected cause of the reaction (i.e. possibly or probably related to one of the following: study treatment, progression of disease, concurrent medications, concurrent illness, or other factors); 5) changes made in the administration of the study intervention and other actions taken to alleviate the clinical event; and 6) patient’s response to medical interventions.  
E.3.d Reporting 
In accordance with IRB guidelines, serious adverse events will be reported within 10 days of the investigator’s or research staff members’ learning of the event to OSU IRB. OSU IRB Event Reports should be submitted through BuckIRB at: http:/orrp.osu.edu/irb/buck -IRB/.  Events resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of 
study activities by [CONTACT_163345] 48 hours whenever possible.  
All events that may represent unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be promptly 
reported (as described above), regardless of whether they occur during or after the study, or involve a subject who has withdrawn from or completed study participation. If changes to the research or consent process are proposed as a result of the event, or if additional information will be provided to current and/or past participants, a protocol amendment will be submitted for IRB review. 
 
Related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting requirements will be reported to the IRB in 
summary form at the time of continuing review.  
 
E.[ADDRESS_189631] and reported immediately to the PI. Deviations that meet the criteria for Immediate Event Reporting (http://orrp.osu.edu/irb/event/index.cfm
) such as 
those that increase risks to subjects and/or compromise scientific integrity will be reported immediately to the IRB.   
 
F.[ADDRESS_189632] be minimized to 
the extent practical and the method and degree of monitoring should be commensurate with risk. The essential elements of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan include:  
1. Monitoring the progress of the study and the safety of participants ; 
2. Plans for assuring compliance with requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events  (AE); 
3. Plans for assuring that any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of the study is 
reported to the appropriate agencies; and  
4. Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance. 
 Prior to the initiation of the project, all project staff will receive standardized training to ensure that the activities 
of the study are conducted in a uniform, safe, confidential and secure manner. A tracking system will be put in 
place to document data collection activities, and reports will be generated on a weekly and monthly basis to monitor the study activities  (Table 5). Meetings will take place on a monthly basis to monitor the activities of the 
project and to continually reassess the progress of the project including assessments of data quality, timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual, retention and monitoring of the risk versus benefits throughout the study period.

Abbott Vascular (AV) obtained marketing approval fo r the XIENCE PRIME Everolimus Eluting Coronary 
Stent System (XIENCE PRIME EECSS) in China from the  China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) 
on August 10th, 2011.   
This prospective, observational, open-label, multi- center, single-arm, post-approval study is designed  to: 
Evaluate the continued safety and effectiveness of the XIENCE PRIME EECSS in a cohort of real-world 
patients receiving the XIENCE PRIME EECSS during co mmercial use in real-world settings in China

The study will evaluate the continued safety and ef fectiveness of the XIENCE PRIME EECSS in a cohort o f 
real-world patients receiving the XIENCE PRIME EECS S during commercial use in real-world settings in 
China  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 3.1  Page   9/[ADDRESS_539703]-approva l 
study (PAS). 
 
4.2. Number of Patients to Be Registered 
Approximately 2000 patients at approximately 45 sit es across China will be consecutively enrolled in t his 
study. Only patients who agree to participate by [CONTACT_423752] (ICF) and who will have 
or have received only XIENCE PRIME stents during th e index procedure are eligible to be registered. 
 
4.3. Patient Treatment 
4.3.1.  Baseline 
1) Baseline Laboratory Assessments 
Baseline laboratory data may be collected up to [ADDRESS_539704] recent assess ment 
value, or clinical significant findings should be i ncluded with the baseline information. In the event  that the

window, it is strongly suggested that it be collect ed after the index procedure or before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5482], 
but no later than [ADDRESS_539705] procedure.   
The following baseline laboratory assessments will be collected:   
 Lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein, high-densit y lipoprotein, triglycerides, and total cholesterol )  
 Serum insulin, serum creatinine, serum fasting gluc ose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)   
 For female subjects of childbearing potential, a ur ine pregnancy test will be performed according to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109210]. 
2) Patient History 
The following medical history data will be collecte d at baseline (including, but no limited to):  
 Demographics, including age and gender  
 Cardiac history including Canadian Cardiovascular S ociety and Braunwald classifications of angina,

invited to participate in the study. Once informed consent is obtained, patient’s data is to be entere d into the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) screening log.  
6.1.2.  Eligibility Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Inclusion Criteria  
 The patient must be at least 18 years of age at the  time of signing the informed consent. 
 The patient or his/her legally-authorized represent ative signs the EC-approved ICF.   
 Only XIENCE PRIME stent(s) is (are) implanted durin g the index procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exclusion Criteria  
No other exclusion criteria are specified for this study. 
6.1.3.  Point of Registration   
The enrollment service must be called after both of  the following conditions have been met:    
 A patient or patient’s legally-authorized represent ative has provided an EC approved, signed and dated  
ICF. 
 Only XIENCE PRIME stent(s) is/are implanted in the coronary vasculature during the index procedure. 
6.1.4.  Patient Deregistration  
This study will consecutively register all consenti ng patients who have met these eligibility criteria . If a 
patient received a stent other than the XIENCE PRIM E stent (including any bail-out stents) during the index 
procedure and is thus not eligible to be registered  into the study, this patient is to be de-registere d. 
A de-registered patient will not undergo the protoc ol follow-up regimen or follow-up by [CONTACT_3476] . De-
registered patients may be replaced until the total  number of required patients for the study is reach ed. 
6.1.5.  Patient Discontinuation  
Each registered patient should remain in the clinic al trial until the required follow-up periods are c omplete. 
The patient has the right to withdraw from the stud y at any time without penalty or loss of benefit. P ossible 
reasons for patient discontinuation may include, bu t are not limited to:  
 Patient death  
 Patient voluntary withdrawal   
 Patient withdrawn by [CONTACT_10670]  
 Patient lost to follow-up  
 Study is terminated  
6.2. Per Protocol Set 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will be used for the pri mary analysis. The PPS consist of all patients regi stered 
in the study who received only XIENCE PRIME stents during the index procedure.  All of the descriptive  
analysis will be based on the PPS. A flow chart is followed to make the determination of PPS clear. 
If a patient misses one of the follow-ups but retur ns for the next, the previous visit will be conside red a 
missed visit. 
Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 3.1  Page   15/[ADDRESS_539712] to follo w-up 
at a certain visit. It should notice that if the pa tient experienced some major key endpoint such as a ll death, 
all MI, all revascularization, or stent thrombosis event in the previous visit, he/she will not be exc luded from 
the denominator even if he/she was lost to follow-u p at the current visit.

Statistical Analysis Plan, V3.1                CONFIDENT IAL         National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases 7. STATISTICAL METHODS 
7.1. Sample Size Calculations and Assumptions 
Approximately 2000 patients will be consecutively r egistered into the study from the general Chinese 
interventional cardiology population. The sample si ze of 2000 is based on CFDA’s requirements for post  
approval studies, but not based on statistical hypo thesis testing. 
No pre-specified hypothesis tests are planned for t his study. 
 
7.2. General Considerations 
7.2.1.  General Methods 
All analyses will be performed using SAS statistica l software (Version 9.3 or higher), unless otherwis e 
noted.  In case that any parameters need to be deri ved, an independent programmer will verify that 
calculated variables (e.g., age, height or weight c onversions) are correct.  The program review also w ill 
include a check whether analyses conform to specifi cations of the Statistical Analysis Plan.  All outp ut will 
be incorporated into Word files, and formatted as t o the appropriate page sizes. 
For categorical variables such as ST, Death and MI,  results will be summarized with patient counts, 
percentages, and exact 95% Clopper-Pearson confiden ce internal for the percentages. For continuous 
variables such as age, results will be summarized w ith the numbers of observations (N), means, standar d 
deviations (SD), median,  the 25th percentile (Q1), the 75th percentile (Q3),  the minimum and the maximum, 
and 95% confidence internal for the means. These ca lculations will be done under the assumption that t he 
data are approximately normal in distribution. For time-to-event variables, such as time to TLF, survi val 
curves may be constructed using Kaplan-Meier estima tes, and log rank test results for subgroup analysi s will 
be displayed for descriptive purposes only. 
7.2.2.  Procedures for Accounting for Missing, Unused or Sp urious Data 
All analyses will be based on available data with m issing data excluded. Any unused or spurious data w ill ve 
noted as appropriate in report.  
 
7.3. Patient Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Char acteristics 
Patient disposition in each site will be presented including number of enrollment, early termination a s well 
as study completion, and size of PPS in excel docum ent attached.  
The summary of demographics and baseline characteri stic previously described in section 5.1 will be 
performed based on PPS. Baseline characteristic var iables include risk factors baseline laboratory 
assessments, medical history, cardiac history and s tatus and baseline lesion characteristics. 
 
7.4. Procedure Records 
The summary of procedure records previously describ ed in section 5.2 will be performed based on PPS. 
Procedure records include index procedure records, loading doses for anti-platelet medications (pre or  
during procedure), treated lesion information and s tent implant details.

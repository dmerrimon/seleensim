1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Study Objectives  
The purpose of this study is to extend previous research (R03 CA144435) and conduct a 
preliminary analysis of the effect of a brief dermatologist -delivered intervention (ABC 
intervention) on patients’ skin cancer related outcomes. The long -term goal with respect to the 
ABC intervention is to conduct a large -scale randomized controlled trial  (RCT) with multiple 
clinics. Specific research aims of the study include:  
 
The first aim examines the efficacy of the Addressing Behavior Change (ABC) intervention 
versus treatment as usual (TAU) during a regular dermatological visit on patient reported 
number of UV protective behaviors (such as use of sunscreen) and UV risk behaviors (such as 
number of sunburns) using a longitudinal design (3 and 6 month).  
 
The second aim of the study will evaluate moderating factors, such as gender and history of 
skin c ancer, and mediating factors, such as attitudes and self -efficacy, which impact the efficacy 
Page 3 of 20 of the intervention. The mediating and moderating variables may help to identify those 
individuals whom the intervention is more (or less) effective.  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_265109] udy Endpoints  
Whether or not the ABC intervention was efficacious when delivered by [CONTACT_220851] a 
routine office visit compared to treatment as usual, on a number of UV protective behaviors.  
 
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Whether or not moderating factors such as gender, age, and history of skin cancer, and 
mediating factors, such as attitudes and self -efficacy, identify individuals for whom the ABC 
intervention is more or less effective.  
 
2.0 Background   
 
2.1 Scientific Backgroun d and Gaps  
The diagnosis of melanoma (skin cancer) was estimated to have approximately 80,000 new 
cases in 2014, with over 10,000 persons dying from melanoma (American Academy of 
Dermatology, 2014). The main factor leading to skin cancer has been UV e xposu re (Veierod et 
al., 2003). Therefore, individuals can reduce their skin cancer risk (as well as its morbidity and 
mortality) by [CONTACT_220852] (such as wearing sunscreen and protective 
clothing ) and reducing both intentional and uninte ntional UV exposure.  
 
Deterrence through expert delivered education approaches has been the major method of 
attempting to change UV risk behaviors. Effective communication between doctors (MD) and 
patients has been shown to enhance a variety of outcomes, such as improved health, improved 
patient management of chronic illness, decreased symptoms, treatment compliance, and overall 
satisfaction with care.  
 
Using the ABC (Addressing Behavior Change) intervention to change UV risk behaviors is a 
strategy based  on the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is a client centered 
approach originally developed in the addictive behaviors field with the intent of promoting and 
supporting behavior change through empathic communication. T he ABC intervention  
emphasizes a collaborative relationship between health care providers and patients when 
addressing behavior change rather than MDs dictating change to a patient.  
 
While we have developed and tested the ABC intervention during routine office visits in our  R03 
study, what is lacking is an examination of using the ABC intervention to address skin protective 
behaviors.  
  
 
2.[ADDRESS_265110] -delivered 
intervention on patients’ skin cancer related outcomes. We had previously received a grant R03 
CA144435, which found that dermatologists were very motivated to deliver the ABC 
intervention, were able to quickly learn the skill s associated with the intervention, were able to 
deliver the intervention with fidelity, and showed minimal deterioration in knowledge, skills, and 
motivation over a [ADDRESS_265111] the promise of the ABC intervention, which supports the need of an 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the ABC intervention on patient outcomes such as UV risk and 
protective behaviors.  
Page 4 of 20  
 
2.3 Study Rationale  
To date, it is unclear how  effective the ABC intervention will be on patients’ UV risk and 
protective behaviors. While we have found that dermatologists both like the ABC intervention 
and are able to deliver it with fidelity, and patients in a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_220841] u tilize 
sunscreen and rated their dermatologist communications higher than TAU patients, it is unclear 
if the ABC dermatologist -delivered intervention will change patient behavior.

5) Patients may include anyone who meets inclusion criteria (including previous skin cancer 
patients, newly diagnosed skin cancer patients, non -skin cancer patients)  
 
Providers must:  
1) Provide skin examinations  (either annual full body skin check or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134453])  or Mohs 
surgical procedures directly to patients (rather than supervise residents)  
2) Treat patients that meet inclusion criteria for the study  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Patients  will be excluded if they:  
 
1) Do not meet inclusion criteria as stated above  
2) Have psoriasis (as a recommended treatment of psoriasis is intentional UV exposure)  
3) Have had previous exposure to the ABC intervention during the R03 at Penn State Hershey 
Medical Center in 2010  or during data collection for this study during Spring 2016  
 
Providers will be excluded if they:  
1) Only supervise residents and do not provide skin exams directly to patients  
2) Do not treat patients that mee t inclusion criteria for the study  
 
 
3.3 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
3.3.1  Criteria for removal from study  
The only reasons participants will be removed from the study is if they fail to give or withdraw 
consent for participation.   
 
3.3.2  Follow -up for withdrawn subjects  
N/A – withdrawn subjects are simply dropped from the participant pool, and no further contact 
[CONTACT_97632].  
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_265113] the PSHMC Dermatology 
research nurse  coordinator  review appointment schedules at both sites (Hershey  – intervention;  
State College  – control)  to see which patients are scheduled to receive skin checks  (either 
annual full body skin check or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134453])  or Mohs surgical procedures at upcoming 
appointments. The PSHMC Dermatology research coordinator at the clinics  will either: 1) call 
potential patient participants and invite them to participate via the phone, or 2)  send a letter to 
these patients approxim ately 2-4 weeks prior to their scheduled appointment, explaining the 
research and inviting them to  call the research team to obtain more information or to email/call 
the PSHMC research team within  approximately  2 week s if they are not interested in learning 
more about the study .  
 
Providers  interested in participating  at Penn State Hershey Medical Center (PSHMC) and State 
College will be randomly selected from the department s (up to n=10 per site).  
 
4.2 Recruitment process  
 
Recruitment of Patients:  
1) The PSHMC Dermatology research nurse coordinator  will either: 1) call potential participants 
and invite them to participate via the phone, or 2) send a pre-notification letter to these 
patients approximately 2-4 weeks prior to their scheduled appointment, explaining the 
research and inviting them to call the research team to obtain more information or call/email  
within  approximately  2 weeks  if they are not interested in learning more about the study .  
2) For those receiving the pre -notification letter, a fter approximately [ADDRESS_265114] ed 
due to not declining, will follow the same procedures: If they are interested, the research 
assistant will obtain verbal consent to screen patients to see if they qualify for the study 
based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If they are eligible, they will then be formally 
invited. Potential  participants interested in the study  will be asked  to arrive 25 minutes early 
for their appointment so that the con sent form may be reviewed with them in its entirety and 
signed informed consent  can be obtained  in a private area of the clinic  prior to the 
completion of the brief baseline survey . A log will be kept of all de-identified  patients 
contact[CONTACT_220853], with the reasons for declining participation  
as well as those who decline to participate when approached in the clinic (example: adult 
male #1 refused study due to time commitment).  
3) For those who a re called and invited to participate over the phone by a PSHMC research 
assistant, the research assistant will explain the study, and if the patient is interested, the 
research assistant will obtain verbal consent to screen patients to see if they qualify for the 
study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If they are eligible, they will then be formally 
invited. Potential participants interested in the study will be asked to arrive 25 minutes early 
for their appointment so that the consent form may be  reviewed with them in its entirety and 
signed informed consent can be obtained in a private area of the clinic prior to the 
completion of the brief baseline survey. A log will be kept of all de -identified patients 
contact[CONTACT_220854], with reasons for declining participation as 
well as those who decline to participate when approached in the clinic (example: adult male 
#1 refused study due to time commitment).  
 
4) In the first cohort in Spring 2016, we enrolled 27 participants who q ualified after completing 
the screen ing. For the second cohort in Spring 2017, w e plan to enroll a n additional  sample 
of 200 (100 per site). Based on the response rate of the first cohort in Sp ring 2016, we will 
invite up to 770 participants  in Spring 2017 . Once the target enrollment of 200 total (about 
100 per site) is obtained , we will discontinue recruiting. The study will be split into 2 cohorts 
Page 6 of 20 – one taking place in Spring 2016  (n=27)  and the other taking place in Spring 2017  (target 
n=200) .   
5) Particip ants who are interested and who qualify to participate will  either : 1) be asked on the 
phone for their email address in order to send a copy of the consent form and reminder to 
arrive at their scheduled appointment 25 minutes prior to their scheduled time , or 2) receive 
a copy of the informed consent and a letter by [CONTACT_220855] 25 minutes before their scheduled time  to perform the written 
informed consent process  and to complete the baseline survey. Partici pants will also be 
called 1-3 days  before their scheduled appointment to remind them to arrive 25 minutes 
early (see reminder phone script).  
6) 1-month and 3-month follow -up surveys will be conducted online  to reduce burden and allow 
participants to complete them from home. Participants can request mailed, paper -based 
surveys if they do not want to complete the online version of the survey. Paper -based cover 
letter and surveys will be mailed to participants’ homes along with prepaid return envelopes.  
Both the online version of the follow -up surveys as well as the hardcopy surveys (which will 
include identical questions/prompts as the  REDCap  survey ), will include the text at the 
beginning of the survey that sta tes “By [CONTACT_220856]. If you have any questions about the survey or your 
participation, please contact [CONTACT_220857], Sarah Ackerman, at 814 -865-4222 or 
[EMAIL_4334] ”. Participants will receive an invitation email, up to [ADDRESS_265115] methods.  
Subjects will be informed in the consent process:  
“You should be aware that it is illegal in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to text while 
driving.  It is also dangerous to pay attention to your cellular phone while driving, walking, or 
doing any activity  that requires your attention. You should continue to exercise good judgment 
on this while participating in this study.”  
 
Please note: Mailed hardcopy surveys/letters will only be offered to individuals who indicate 
that they do not have access to the internet, not as an option for all participants. With the 
timeframe between the 1 -month survey and the 3 -month survey being sh orter, we do not 
want there to be any overlap of surveys if participants are slow to mail back their responses.  
 
Recruitment of Physician Interventionists:  
1) The dermatologists from the intervention site will undergo [ADDRESS_265116] 
of it in the evening (instead of morning) and will require no additional time co mmitment from 
the dermatologists to participate in the training or study.  
a. The first component of training will involve learning to deliver each of the [ADDRESS_265117]. This will include 
component C (supervision) in order to ensure there is consistency in 
intervention delivery.  
2) Up to 10 providers  from the intervention site and up to 10 providers  from the control site  will 
be randomly selected to participate. If they agree , intervention dermatologists will give 
Page 7 of 20 verbal consent after reviewing the Summary Explanation of Research provided by a 
member of the research team during the scheduled Dermatology Department meeting , and 
control site dermatologists will give verbal consent prior to the recruitment of patients .  
3) The dermatologists at the control site will deliver treatment as usual (TAU) to their patients, 
and will not undergo the training and supervision.

4.4 Eligibility/screening of subject s 
Patients will be pre-screened following the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in sections 3.1 
and 3.2  of this protocol by [CONTACT_220860] R esearch Nurse Coordinator who ha s 
clinical access to this patient population . Subjects will then give ver bal consent to be screened 
over the phone for eligibility for this research study for items not able to be determined from 
clinical access.  
 
 
5.0 Consent Process and Documentation   
5.1 Consent Process  
5.1.1  Obtaining Informed Consent  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Timing and Location of Consent  
If a patient expresses interest in participating when they are called to be invited over 
the phone (or when they contact [CONTACT_3019]), they will be verbally consented to be screened 
for the research study (see phone script s for consenting language).  
 
Research assist ants will then approach participants to obtain informed  consent 
when they arrive in the dermatology clinics at PSHMC and State College after they 
check in for their appointment. The research assistant will escort the patient to a 
private area where the in formed consent process will take place. The consent form 
will be read and reviewed in its entirety, all questions will be answered prior to the 
subject signing for participation. If patients agree to participate, they will then sign 
the informed consent fo rm and provided a copy.  
 
Additionally, a t the beginning of every online survey (as well as paper -based 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), it will include the text that states “By [CONTACT_220861]. If you have any questions about the 
Page [ADDRESS_265118] coordinator, Sarah Ackerman, at 
[PHONE_4678] or [EMAIL_4334] ”. 
 
For participating physicians:  Those physicians who agree to participate in the 
research will give verbal consent after reviewing the Summary Explanation of 
Research provided by a member of the research team  during  the scheduled training 
(intervention) or prior to patients being recruited (control) .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Coercion or Undue Influence during Consent  
Study procedures will be fully explained, all critical study information will be 
disclosed, voluntariness will be emphasized as well as the fact that no care will be 
denied regardless of the subject’s decision . Subjects will be told they do not have to 
participate in the research. They will be told that whether or not they agree to 
participate in the study, their current or futu re care at the PSHMC will not be 
affected by [CONTACT_220862].  
 
For physician subjects, they will be told they do not have to take part in the research 
and that their educational and employment status will not be affected in any way by 
[CONTACT_220862].  
 
5.1.2  Waive r or alteration of the informed consent requirement  
We are requesting a waiver of informed consent so that the Hershey coordinator/team 
can review clinic schedules for recruitment purposes. This waiver will minimize the 
possibility of subjects being contac ted who do not qualify for the research based on 
information available in their medical record.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_265119] an d the investigator obtaining informed 
consent will sign, date and time the consent document.  
 
The participant will receive a signed/dated copy of the consent documentation for their 
records.

of PHI  
 
Check all that apply:  
 Authorization will be obtained and documented as part of the consent process.  
 Partial waiver is requested for recruitment purposes only  (Check this box if patients’ 
medical records will be accessed to determine eligibility before consent/authorization 
has been obtained)  
 Full waiver  is requested  for entire research study  (e.g., medical record review studies )  
 Alteration is request ed to waive requirement for written documentation of authorization  
 
6.2 Waiver o r Alteration of Authorization  for the Uses and Disclosures  of PHI  
 
6.2.1  Access, use or disclosure of PHI represent ing no more than a minimal risk to the 
privacy of the individual

research information will be destroyed.  
 
6.2.2  Explanation for why  the research could not be  practicably be conducted without 
access to and use of PHI  
We will be conducting the study in dermatology clinics and will be contact[CONTACT_220863] , email,  and/or phone for recruitment purposes. We will need the names of 
participants in order to know who was deemed eligible by [CONTACT_220864], and as age is an 
inclusion criteria, we will need access to age. However, until the patients  agree to 
participate in t he study via the phone screen ing or contact [CONTACT_220865] , the 
Page 10 of 20 PSHMC Dermatology Research Nurse Coordinator /Hershey team  will be the only ones 
with access to this information.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_265121] of the ABC intervention on the 
intervention group versus the control group receiving TAU. Participants will not be randomized 
to a group. Instead, patients who meet eligibility criteria at PSHMC will be invited to participate 
at the intervention site, and current patients who meet eligibility criteria at the clinic in State 
College will be invited to participate at the control site.  
 
 
7.2 Study P rocedures  
Subjects will be recruited from two sites: 1) Penn State Hershey Medical Center Clinic in 
Hershey (PSHMC), which will serve as the intervention site where patient participants will 
receive the ABC interventions, and 2) Penn State Medical Group in State Col lege (State 
College), which will serve as the control site where patient participants will receive TAU.  
 
1) Participation will begin when participants are screened for eligibility over the phone.  
2) Participation will continue for subjects when they arrive at either PSHMC or State College for 
an appointment with a participating physician that will include a skin check (either annual full 
body skin check or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_134453])  or Mohs surgical procedure  (please see the 
recruitment section for a step -by-step process of how eligible participants will be obtained).  
A skin check involves the physician checking the patients’ skin for any growth or mark that 
could potentially become cancerous. Patients at the control site will be receiving TAU for 
their skin check; patients at the intervention site will receive a normal skin -check, combined 
with the ABC -intervention (see uploaded  information sheet). The audio recordings which will 
be done at both the control an d intervention sites  for all participants  will be used to compare 
the information patients receive from their doctor during the course of a skin check .  
3) Participants will be asked to arrive [ADDRESS_265122] communication, attitudes about sun p rotection 
behavior, self -efficacy about sun protective behaviors, etc. (Please refer to Measures 
document for full questionnaire).  
4) As part of the surveys, participants will be asked to provide the contact [CONTACT_21115] a 
friend or relative that we could contact [CONTACT_220866] 1 -month and 3 -month follow -up surveys. Phone and email/letter scripts are 
included in the recruitment documents. We will attempt to call the “collateral contact” up to 2 
times, and th en will send a letter or email if we cannot reach them by [CONTACT_648]. Participants will 
be reminded of the following when they log on to the survey: “By [CONTACT_220867]. If you have any questi ons about 
Page [ADDRESS_265123] coordinator, Sarah Ackerman, at 
[PHONE_4678] or [EMAIL_4334]”.  
5) The patient will then proceed to their appointment with a dermatologist. At the intervention 
site, the provider who has been trained to deliver the ABC intervention will do so during the 
skin exam. During the appointment at the intervention site, providers will provide their 
patients with a handout (as a small card and/or magnet) which summarizes what they 
discussed  during the appointment regarding sun protection (CURE Method Tips – see 
uploaded document). At the control site, patients will receive TAU, with no ABC intervention. 
All patient  participant  appointment s are to be audio recorded  and by [CONTACT_220868], 
patients are consenting to be audio recorded.  A research assistant will accompany the 
patient into the exam room to audio record the visit. Only provider s who have taken the 
appropriate training will have patients identified to participate in this stu dy (intervention) . 
Providers at both the intervention and control sites will be consented prior to any audio 
recordings being done, as explained in section 5.1.1.  Research assistants will later listen to 
and code the data to determine if the components of the ABC intervention were delivered 
with fidelity. Control sessions will be recorded and coded using the same criteria to 
document those patients who did not receive elements of the ABC intervention.  The 
recordings will be coded with the patient’s study nu mber and will be destroyed per PSHMC 
IT Security Group policy  as soon as data is coded from their analysis. The participant and 
the provider will be reminded prior to the recording to not use names or other identifying 
information during the recording.  
6) At 1-months and 3-months following this appointment, the first ( 1 month) and second ( 3 
months) follow -up surveys will be sent out , via email to complete online to allow participants 
to complete at home. Participants can request mailed, paper -based surveys if they do not 
want to complete the online version of the survey. A cover letter and p aper-based surveys 
will be mailed to participants’ homes along with prepaid return envelopes. In an email, 
participants will be instructed to complete the survey online (or , if the participant requested a 
mailed paper -based survey, they will be instructed via mailed letter to  mail back the paper -
based survey to the investigator’s office in the enclosed pre -paid envelopes). The 1-month 
and 3-month follow -up surveys will be almost identical to the baseline survey  (minus the 
screening items , background item, and physician communication item, as indicated in the 
measures document ), and each should take about 5 -10 minutes to complete. Participants 
will receive a $ [ADDRESS_265124] for 
completing each survey, totaling $ 75 if they complete all 3 surveys . Participants will be paid 
for the baseline survey after completion of the visit , and the two follow -up surveys  will be 
paid at the end of  the study (that is, after the 3 -month follow -up survey) . If they do not 
complete all surveys they will be compensated for the ones they do complete . Participants 
will be asked during the screening call  which payment option they wo uld like, so that we can 
have the appropriate option in clinic, and if they do not complete one of the follow -up 
surveys, we will have their payment option on file.  
 
Note: Dermatologists from the intervention site will undergo [ADDRESS_265125] in the evening  and will require no additional time. 1) The first component of 
training will involve learning to deli ver each of the 6 components of the intervention. Patient 
interactions will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_5984]. 2) The second component will involve role 
plays. The physicians will practice implementing the intervention on research assistants who will 
pose  as mock patients. 3) The third component will involve supervision and feedback. Drs. 
Mallett and Turrisi will observe the physicians while they deliver the ABC intervention to 
patients. They will then provide feedback privately. Up to 10 providers  from th e departments of 
dermatology at each site will be selected to perform the skin exams, based on their availability.  
 
Physicians at the control site will deliver TAU to their patients, and will not undergo the training 
and supervision.  
 
Page 12 of 20 7.3 Duration of Partici pation  
Patient participants will be involved in the study for up to 4 months. The baseline visit in clinic 
will take approximately  25 minutes longer than their scheduled appointment , which lasts on 
average 15 minutes (they are asked to arrive 25 minutes early to complete the consent and 
baseline survey) . Each post - survey will take [ADDRESS_265126] up to 60 minutes (inclusive of their scheduled dermatologist 
appointment) over a 4 month period.  
 
Dermatologists at the intervention site will be involved from the beginning of their training 
through the end of baseline data collection, approximately 8-10 weeks (Ap ril-May 2016 & 2017) . 
Dermatologists at the control site will be involved only during baseline data collection, 
approximately 8-10 weeks (April -May 2016 & 2017) .

9.0 Statistical Plan  
 
9.1 Sample size determination  
874 is the maximum number of patient participants to be enrolled.  
The number of participants that will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] ( 874) is much larger than the number we 
intend to enroll ( 227). Based on the response rate of the first cohort in Spring [ADDRESS_265127] cohort in 2016.   
 
 
9.2 Statistical methods  
We will utilize a number of statistical methods. For example, basic t -tests and regression will be 
used for preliminary analyses. The majority of the analyses will center on two types: 1) 
moderated multiple linear regression (SEM models) for Aim 2 and 2) M ixed ANOVA for Aims [ADDRESS_265128] copi[INVESTIGATOR_220844] a code number only  (PIN)  and stored in locked filing cabinets in 
locked offices. Survey responses will be entered into a secure research database: REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web -based application designed to support data capture for research 
studies. REDCap  is maintained by [CONTACT_220869] [ADDRESS_265129] protected computer in a locked office and/or the 
PRO Health Lab’s departmental Penn State PASS drive, only accessible by [CONTACT_220870].  
We have taken the following steps to protect individuals’ identities as research participants: 1) PSU 
research team will not have access to potential  participants until they  are pre -screened by [CONTACT_220871] , and only the PSHMC Dermatology 
research nurse  coordinator and Hershey team , who has access to this population,  will be involved i n 
the initial recruitment; 2 ) Responses to surveys will be identified only by a unique personal identifier 
(PIN), which is a number randomly generated for each participant in this study; 3) Hershey will keep a 
master list of names, addresses, phone numbers , and PI[INVESTIGATOR_220845], 
and PSU will create a master list based on the  participants who agree to participate when pre -screened 
(and verbally consented) over the phone or contact [CONTACT_220872], to send reminder letters, 1-month and 3-
month follow -up surveys and compensation.  The master list  of consented participants  will be stored 
separately from the survey responses on a password protected computer in a locked office and/or the 
PRO Health Lab’s departmental Penn State PAS S drive, only accessible by [CONTACT_220870]; and all audio recordings will be destroyed once they are scored and coded .  
 
Considering that participants will be sent a link and PIN number to access the  1-month , and 3-month 
follow -up survey s, they can complete it in any location they wish (e.g., home ). The level of privacy they 
receive is limited to the location they choose to complete it at.  
 
10.1.1  Identifiers associated with data and/or specimens  
The data is de -identified as we use a PIN number to identify the data. Any identifiable 
information is used only to invite participants for follow -up surveys  (and is marked as an 
identifier within REDCap)  and to compensate them for participating in the study, and is stored in 
a file separate f rom the survey data.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Use of Codes, Master List  
A master list containing a code number (PIN) and participant s’ identity will be stored 
in a separate password protected computer file within the REDCap database , only 
accessible by [CONTACT_220873]. The overall list of ALL 
participants invited to the study will be maintained by [CONTACT_220874]; the Penn 
State team will keep a separate list as participants complete  phone screening . This 
file will be kept separate from any collected data. The list will be saved on a 
password protected computer in a locked office and/or the PRO Health Lab’s 
departmental Penn State PASS drive, only accessible by [CONTACT_220870]  
 
10.1.2  Storage of Data and/or Specimens  
 
All data will be stored in the REDCap database on locked, password protected computers in the 
PSHMC Dermatology Research office and PRO Health Lab (320 BBH) and/or on the PRO 
Health Lab’s departmental Penn State PASS drive, only accessible by [CONTACT_220875] [ADDRESS_265130]’s prior consent or where permitted 
according to NIH’s Policy on Issuing Certificates of Confidentiality.  
 
10.1.3  Access to Data and/or Specimens  
Only the study staff listed on this application will have access to th e list.  
 
10.1.4  Transferring Data and/or Specimens  
Data will be physically transported fr om the Penn State Hershey Medical Center clinic sites to 
PSU at University Park.  Signed informed consents , baseline surveys,  and a udio recordings will 
be transported via vehicle from Penn State Hershey Medical Center clinic sites to PSU at 
University Park. The items will be transported in a locked file box in a locked car trunk.   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10.2 Privacy  
All data and other information in this study will be maintained confidentially, and will be identified 
only by a unique personal identifier (PIN), which is a number randomly generated for each 
participant. Data will be entered into an electronic, password protected file, only accessible by

16.0 Number of Subjects  
 
The total maximum number of participants to be enrolled is 894.  
The number of  patient  participants that will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] ( up to 874 ) is much larger than the number we 
intend to enroll ( 227 – including both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 )  (27 enrolled in Cohort 1 between 
Intervention and Control; 200 intended to enroll in Cohort 2 – 100 intervention, and 100 control) . Based 
on the response rate of the first co hort in Spring 2 016, we anticipate a 26% overall response rate, 
resulting in 200 individuals (for cohort 2) who agree to participate.  However, due to uncertainty on the 
Page 16 of 20 overall response rate, participants will be invited in chunks and once we hit our target enrollment, we 
will stop recruiting .  Additionally, we will enroll up to 20 providers  (up to 10  from the control site and up 
to 10  from the intervention site).

Page 19 of 20 25.0 Statistical Analysis Plan  
25.1 Power/Sample Sizes  
The sample sizes were chosen based on statistical, analytic, and theoretical considerations. For 
comparisons of the ABC vs. TAU controls on our outcome variables for Aim 1 (e.g., sun 
protection behaviors), our N should be able to detect effect sizes that correspond to small eff ects, 
Cohen’s d = .2 or eta squares of 2%. The effect sizes are based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_220847]’ sunscreen use intentions following exposure to the ABC intervention (see preliminary 
studies section) and our studies examining group differences u sing motivational enhanced 
interventions to reduce tann ing intentions and behaviors.  Using power estimation procedures 
described in Cohen, the sample sizes should yield power of greater than 0.[ADDRESS_265139] for 
effectiveness of the intervention as a function of a moderator variabl e at baseline (e.g., gender).  
With every moderator, our sample sizes for each group are reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50%. With 
our target N = 300 (at baseline), we will have sufficient samples to explore the potential of [ADDRESS_265140] sample sizes that approximate n = [ADDRESS_265141] if the data are missing at random by [CONTACT_12789] a dummy variable 
that indicates the presence or absence of missing data on a variable. If the data are missing at 
random, the correlations with other variables should be trivial. We will use the EM method as 
implemented in SOLAS or FIML i n Amos to impute missing data.  If the data are not missing at 
random, then we will include dummy variables that explicitly model the nature of the missing 
data.  
Outlier Analysis and Response Distributions . Throughout all of our statistical analyses, we will 
be sensi tive to the potential influence of outlier cases and possible biases due to ill -behaved (i.e., 
nonnormal) distributions. Where necessary, we will use  robust analytic techniques.  
Measurement Error. Many of our variables will be subject to some measurement e rror that, in 
turn, can bias our parameter estimates. Where possible, we will pursue analytic strategies that 
permit us to incorporate an error theory into our parameter estimation methods (structural 
equation modeling). When multiple indicators of an unde rlying latent variable are present, the 
incorporation of an error theory is straightforward. When an error theory cannot be empi[INVESTIGATOR_220848], we will take care to interpret our data in light of the potential bias that may be 
present.  
Multiple Te sts and Evaluation of Study Aims. Some of our analyses will have multiple DVs. We 
will be sensitive to inflated experiment -wise error and control it with the multivariate F statistic 
based on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_220849], Turrisi, and Kirk.  
25.3 Aim 1: Evaluate efficacy of the ABC interventi on 
[CONTACT_220880] (Co -I) will conduct all outcome analyses in order to avoid any bias. First a 2 (Group: 
ABC vs. Controls) x 3 (Time: baseline, 3 & 6 mo . follow -up) Mixed ANOVA will be conducted 
to test the intervention on a given outcome variable (e.g., use of sun protection). First, we expect 
to observe a main effect of Group with the highest reports of sun protection (and lowest reports 
of UV risk beha viors) occurring in our ABC condition. Second, we anticipate observing a Group 
x Time interaction with no differences between the groups at baseline but differences (lower risk 
in the ABC group) at each of the follow -ups. He will also assess the scientific  and clinical 
significance of the effects utilizing the magnitude estimation approach described by [CONTACT_220878].  
Specifically, statistical significance refers to the case when the null hypothesis is rejected, 
whereas magnitude estimation approaches emphasize th e size of the effect. To utilize magnitude 
Page [ADDRESS_265142] size observed is less than the criterion for 
meaningfulness, then the result is deemed nonsignificant, even if the null is rejected. We will use 
Cohen’s d statistic to assess clinical significance of the m ain effects and interactions.  We will 
define an effect as clinically and statistically significant to the extent  that the d is greater than or 
equal  to .20.  
25.4 Aim 2: Evaluate moderators and mediators  
We will also undertake a set of analyses that identify individual differences in intervention 
efficacy to examine for whom the intervention is more or less effective. Whe re the moderator 
variable is qualitative (e.g., gender), it will be included as another factor into the Mixed ANOVA 
described earlier. For example, a 2 x 3 x 2 (group x time x patient gender) on sun protection may 
be used to evaluate gender of the patient as a moderator. First, we will explore whether our effect 
of Group, where the lowest reports of UV risk behaviors occurring in our ABC condition, differs 
by [CONTACT_220879] (a group x gender interaction). Second, we will explore whether our 
Group  x Time interaction differs by [CONTACT_547] (e.g., a significant group x time x gender interaction). 
These analyses will be repeated for each of the qualitative moderator variables and evaluated for 
clinical significance. For quantitative (ordinal or interval) m oderator variables (e.g., age), we will 
calculate product terms between the moderator and group and then analyze the data using 
moderated regression following th e logic in Jaccard & Turrisi. For mediation, we will use the 
joint significance test, which Mon te Carlo simulations have shown has the most power and 
lowest Type I error rates  relative to other approaches. We will evaluate model fit using global fit 
indices (e.g.,CFI, RMSEA), and more focused indices that suggest specific areas of poor fit 
(modifica tion indices). We will use bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_220850] -normal 
variable distributions. Using Amos 20.0, if both the a and b paths are significant at the .[ADDRESS_265143].  When there is evidence of mediation, 95% 
confidence intervals using the bootstrap procedures in Amos can be calculated to provide a range 
of estimates for the mediated effect. If the co nfidence intervals do not contain zero there is 
evidence of statistically significant mediation. Figure 1.

Aims/Objectives
1/
Increase
the
safety
of
tracheal
extubation
in
pediatric
anesthesia.
2/
Define
an
objective,
quantitative
metric
to
guide
extubation
in
anesthetized
pediatric
patients.
3/
Demonstrate
a
method
to
decrease
anesthetic
vapor
requirements
for
extubation
and
thereby

4/
Compare

Study
Protocol
In
pediatric
patients
undergoing
general
anesthesia
for
surgery,
subjects
will
be
randomized
to
two
groups:
Group
1/
Deep
vapor
extubation
group,
and
Group
2/
Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_655750].
For
subjects
randomized
to
Group
1,
the
protocol
is
as
follows:
At
the
conclusion
of
surgery
and
in
preparation
for
tracheal
extubation,
spontaneous
ventilation
will
be
reinitiated
and
a
deep
plane
of
anesthesia
will
be
established
with
anesthetic
vapor
set
at
1.5
MAC
(sevoflurane
~3.75%)

then
be
extubated.

2/
Pre-stimulus
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_115726]:
Measure
pupil
with
portable
infrared

will
be
made
to
establish
a

Perform
standardized

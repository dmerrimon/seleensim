5/P      15 November 2010 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY 
Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is  a type of choroidal neovascularization 
(CNV) that has occult characteristics on fluorescein angiogr aphy but demonstrates 
saccular dilations and polypoidal interconn ecting vascular channels on indocyanine 
green angiography.  PCV results in seros anguinous pi[INVESTIGATOR_888840] 
(PED) and neurosensory retinal detachments secondary to leakage and bleeding from 
the choroidal vascular lesions. PCV is a di stinct clinical syndr ome and the aneurysmal 
dilatations may be visible clinically as r eddish-orange.  PCV was originally recognized 
as a “uveal bleeding syndrome”  often presenting with mult iple recurrent hemorrhagic 
PED’s in middle-aged, pi[INVESTIGATOR_888841].  With time and recognition, a broader 
concept of PCV has occurr ed, including a broad range of ages, races including a 
propensity for Asians as well as African Am ericans, and both sexes (Yannuzzi 1997).   
While debated, the pathogenesis of the vascular abno rmality in PCV has been 
proposed to be a likely variant of CNV (U yama 1999), although others propose PCV 
as inner choroidal vessel abno rmalities that are distinct from CNV (Yuzawa 2005).   
Within the expanding spectrum of PCV, t here is some overlap in elderly patients 
initially classified as age-related ma cular degeneration (AMD).  PCV may be 
differentiated from AMD in that PCV is more commonly observed in the peripapi[INVESTIGATOR_888842], without associated drusen, and in n on-white patients (Yannuzzi 1999).  While 
the natural course of PCV is somewhat more favorabl e than AMD-associated CNV, 
active polypoidal lesions often cause subfoveal hemorrhagic PED’s, subretinal 
fluid/exudates and fibrosis resu lting in visual loss.   
 The stimuli that prod are unknown.  However, there is evidence suggesting that 
angiogenic factors, such as va scular endothelial growth fact or (VEGF), play a role in 
the pathogenesis of AMD-related CNV and in all forms of ocular neovascularization 
(see section 1.3).   Systemic hypert ension is associated with PCV.   
 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
6/P      [ADDRESS_1244610] not be en performed.  Anecdotal evidence in case series 
indicates that PCV may respond to therma l laser (often ICG-guided) photocoagulation 
(Uyama 1999, Yannuzzi 1990, Nishijima 2004 ) or photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 
Visudyne (Spaide 2002, Chan  2004, Silva 2005, Nazimul 2005).  Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_888843] (Okubo 2005), submacular surgery (Matsuoka 2004) 
and transpupi[INVESTIGATOR_66284] (TTT)  (Vedantham 2005) have been published as 
single case reports indicating possible benefit for PCV.  Ot her CNV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_888844], radiotherapy, and tr anslocation surgery have not been the focus 
of published reports in PCV patients. 
 
1.3 RANIBIZUMAB AND PCV 
There is well-established evidence suggesti ng that angiogenic factors, such as 
vascular endothelial growth fa ctor (VEGF), play a major role in the pathogenesis 
of AMD-related CNV and in all forms of ocul ar neovascularization.  Anti-VEGF therapy 
with aptamers (Gragoudas 2004) and with anti bodies (Brown 2006, Rosenfeld 2006) 
has been demonstrated to be beneficial therapy for neovascular AMD. Surgically-
excised PCV lesions demonstrate strong VEGF expression thus indica ting a likely role 
for VEGF in PCV proliferat ion and exudation (Matsuoka 2004, Terasaki 2002).  In 
addition, a significant increase of aqueous  humor VEGF was found in eyes with 
exudative PCV (Tong 2006).  This  rationale has led to investi gation of intravitreal anti-
VEGF therapy for exudative PCV.    Gomi and coworkers (Gomi 2008) assessed t he short-term efficacy of intravitreal 
bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA) for [ADDRESS_1244611] at 3 months.  Lesion size improved in one eye 
but residual or enlarged lesi ons were observed in the ot her 10 eyes.  There were no 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
7/P      15 November 2010 significant short-term effects on visual acuity.  The authors proposed that a single 
bevacizumab injection is in sufficient and that  repeated bevacizumab injections or 
alternative anti-VEGF agent s with greater retinal penetrat ion or VEGF affinity may be 
required (Gomi 2008).   Song and coworkers (Song 2009) similarly evaluated a single 
intravitreal bevacizumab inje ction in [ADDRESS_1244612] retinal thickness and visual acuity.  Fluorescein angiographic 
leakage was reduced at 3 mont hs and partial polyp regression occurred in more than 
50% of eyes.  ICG angiography demonstr ated no changes in the choroidal branching 
vessels suggesting that bevacizumab may not penetrate deeply enough to effect the 
more mature choroidal vascular abnormalit ies (Song 2009). Lai and coworkers (Lai 
2008) treated [ADDRESS_1244613] 
on lesion regression and propos ed that combination bevac izumab with PDT may be 
optimal (Lai 2008).   Lee and coworkers (Lee 2008) tr eated [ADDRESS_1244614] eyes.  The 
authors proposed that bevacizumab monother apy may be adequate therapy for less 
advanced lesions (Lee 2008).    There are just two published reports eval uating ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech 
Inc., SanFrancisco, CA) for PCV.  Reche-Frutos and coworkers (Reche-Frutos 2008) noted that [ADDRESS_1244615] thickness 
at 3 months follow-up in a Hispanic populat ion.   Polyp regressi on was observed in 9 
of 13 eyes.  The authors proposed that in comparison to bevaciz umab, ranibizumab’s 
deeper penetration may be responsible for the favorable polyp regression rate 
(Reche-Frutos 2008).  Kokame and cowork ers (Kokame 2009) treated [ADDRESS_1244616] of 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
8/P      15 November 2010 eyes demonstrated decrease lesion size but  branching choroidal vessels were 
unchanged.  A press release from QLT Inc. (QLT Inc. 2009) reported results from the 
EVEREST prospective, randomized study evaluating ranibizumab monotherapy 
versus PDT monotherapy versus ranibizum ab/PDT combination therapy for 61 eyes 
with Asian PCV.  At 6 mont hs the ranibizumab monother apy, PDT monotherapy, and 
ranibizumab/PDT combination groups gained 9.2, 7.5, and 10. 9 letters, respectively.  
Complete polyp regression occurred in 29%, 71% and 78% of eyes in the ranibizumab 
monotherapy, PDT monotherapy, and ranibi zumab/PDT combination groups, 
respectively (QLT Inc. 2009).   The above data evaluating anti-VEGF therapy fo r PCV is limited by a relatively small 
number of treated eyes, short follow-up  and absence of comparison groups.  
However, given the encouraging results of the above limited data along with the 
known favorable results of anti-VEGF therapy  for neovascular AMD, as well as the 
overlap between exudative AMD and PCV, furt her evaluation of anti-VEGF therapy for 
PCV is needed.  In addition,  evaluation of ant i-VEGF therapy for PCV has primarily 
occurred in an Asian populati on and little or no data exist for African-American and 
Caucasian populations.  In fact, Afric an-Americans are har dly represented in 
neovascular AMD anti-VEGF tria ls.   Ethnic differences in PCV may well affect 
treatment responses due to g enetic makeup, variances in  the natural history of 
disease, and livin g environments.   
 We previously enrolled 20 non-Asian PCV ey es and evaluated intravitreal ranibizumab 
(0.3mg and 0.5 mg) for exudative PCV.   Su bjects included 16 African-Americans (12 
female, 4 male) and 3 male Caucasians. The mean age was 63.6 years and the mean 
follow-up for the present ongoing study is  18 months. Mean baseline BCVA was 
20/127 (range, 20/16-20/500) and CPT was 298 μm. Mean BCVA increased from 
baseline by 1.2 and 1.5 ETDRS lines at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Four of 14 
eyes and 3 of 12 eyes gained ≥3 lines BCVA at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Mean 
CPT decreased from baseline by 53 μm and 67 μm at 12 and 24 months, respectively. 
Eyes received a mean of 7.2 injections dur ing a mean follow-up of  19 months. Visually 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
9/P      [ADDRESS_1244617] progression (n=3), mild vitreous 
hemorrhage (n=2), and macular hole (n=1). No systemic drug-related adverse events 
wereobserved. Intravitreal ranibizumab was well tolera ted in non-Asian pat ients with PCV; the 
majority of eyes experienced improvement s in BCVA and CPT following ranibizumab 
treatment.   Clinical data of intravitreal ant i-VEGF therapy indicate a need for multiple injections to 
maintain a beneficial effect for AMD, as well as for diabetic macular edema (DME).  
Similarly, for PCV, data outlined above indicates a need for multiple anti-VEGF 
injections and an absence of  lesion regression with anti-VEGF monotherapy.  Thus, 
dose-escalation of ranibizumab has been inve stigated using 1.[ADDRESS_1244618] greater e fficacy and/or require less 
injections.  Early studies for AMD and DME indicate higher doses are likely safe and 
may improve visual and anatomic outcomes.   The HARBOR study (FVF4579g) is a 
phase III randomized trial (Genentech Inc., S anFrancisco, CA) comparing 2.[ADDRESS_1244619] dose monotherapy.  In addition, 
African Americans are underrepr esented in AMD trials.  We propose to evaluate high 
dose (2.0 mg) ranibizumab in previously  treated and treatment naïve PCV eyes. 
 
1.4 NONCLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH RANIBIZUMAB 
1.4.1 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics
 
The pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab hav e been investigated in rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys following intravitreal and intravenous administration.  In both 
species, following intravitreal administr ation, ranibizumab was cleared from the 
vitreous humor with a half-life of 2–[ADDRESS_1244620] of vitreous concentrations and declined in parallel with vitreous

1.4.[ADDRESS_1244622]  of blunting the vascular permeability 
induced by [CONTACT_12270].  These results are consis tent with the decrease in retinal vascular 
permeability as observed on optical coher ence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein 
angiography in AMD and diabetic macular edema studies and fu rther support the 
rationale for the use of ranibizumab in CRVO and BRVO, in which vascular 
permeability plays a significant role in the pathology   
 
1.5 CLINICAL EXPERIE NCE WITH RANIBIZUMAB 
Ranibizumab has been or is being studied in more than 5000 subjects with 
neovascular AMD in a number of  Phase I, I/II, II, III, and IIIb clinical trials.  .  
Ranibizumab is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocu lar infections and in 
those with known hypersensitivity to rani bizumab or any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_795647].  Intravitreal injections, including those with r anibizumab, have been 
associated with endophthalimit s and retinal detatchment.  Proper aseptic injection 
technique should always be used when administ ering ranibizumab.  Increases in IOP 
have been noted within 60 minutes of intravit real  injection with ranibizumab.  
Therefore, IOP as well as perfusion of t he optic nerve head should be monitored and 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
11/P      [ADDRESS_1244623] occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections include endophthalmitis, 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and iatrogenic traumatic cataract.  Other serious ocular adverse events observed among rani bizumab-treated subjects and occurring in 
<2% of subjects included intraocular in flammation and increased IOP.  The most 
common adverse reactions (reported >
 6% higher in ranibizumab-treated subjects 
than control subjects) were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous floaters, 
increased IOP, and intraocular inflammation., 
 
Although there was a low rate  (<4%) of arterial thromboembolic events  (ATEs) 
observed in the ranibizumab clinical trials  there is a potential risk of ATEs following 
intravitreal use of inhibitors of VEGF.  T he rate of ATEs in three studies (FVF2598g, 
FVF2587g, and FVF3192g) in the first year was1.9% of subjects in the combined 
group of subjects treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared with 1.1% of 
subjects in the control arms of the studies .  In the second year of Study FVF2598g and 
FVF2587g, the rate of ATEs was 2.6% of subjects in the combined group of those 
treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg  ranibizumab compared with 2.9% of subjects in the 
control arm.  The most common non-ocular adverse reactions observed in >  15% of 
ranibizumab-treated subjects t hat occurred more frequently than in control subjects 
included, nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_19625]. 
  
The Sailor study (FVF3689g) evaluated the safety  of intravitreal ranibizumab in a large 
population of subjects with CN V secondary to AMD.  Subjec ts in Cohort 1 (N=2378) 
were randomized (1:1) to receive ranibizum ab at a dose level of 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg; 
subjects were masked to these dose levels.  Treatment was admini stered monthly for 
three initial doses (Day 0,  Month 1, and Month 2), with scheduled follow-up visits on 
Months 3,6,9, and 12.  Retreatment after th e first three injections was performed as 
needed, on the basis of predefined criteria with injections no more frequently than every 
30 days. 
 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
12/P      15 November 2010 Cohort 2 (N=1992) consisted of subjects enrolled after the majority of Cohort 1 subjects 
had been enrolled, with enr ollment continuing until ranibizumab was approved or 
denied by [CONTACT_112855], and if approved, until commercia lly available or 30 
September 2006, whichever was earlier.  Subjects in Cohort 2 received open-label 
ranibizumab at the 0.5 mg dose level, with an initial injection on Day 0 followed by 
[CONTACT_112856] ’s discretion, no more frequently than every 30 days.  
Subjects were monitored for safety for a total of 12 months; safety information, 
including both serious and nonserious adverse  events, was collected at every clinic 
visit, with two formal safety visi ts scheduled at M onths 6 and 12. 
 
The study consisted of a 30-day screening period and a 1-year tr eatment period.  
Treatment duration was approx imately 197 days for both dose groups in Cohort 1 and 
144 days for subjects in Cohort 2.  The m ean follow-up time diffe red between Cohort 1 
and Cohort 2, 337 days versus 254 days, respectively.  Ranibizumab was well tolerated, and the in cidence of ocular SAE s and AEs was low 
and unrelated to dose.  The rates of individua l key ocular SAEs in Cohort 1 were < 1% 
and were similar across dose groups.  Endopht halmitis or pres umed endophthalmitis 
developed in 0.2% subjects in  the 0.3-mg group and 0.4% subj ects in the 0.5-mg group.  
The incidence of ocular inflammation, including iritis, uveitis, vitrit is, and iridocylitis was 
1.9% in the 0.3-mg group and 1.5% in the 0. 5-mg group.  Overall cataract rates were 
5.4% (0.3 mg) and 6.0% (0.5 mg) and we re similar when broken down by [CONTACT_112857], 
subcapsular, and cortical subtypes.  The rates of individual key ocul ar SAEs in Cohort 2 
were <1%.  The rates of key non-ocular SAEs and AEs , including Antiplatelet Trialists’ 
Collaboration (APTC) ATEs, MI, and vascular death were similar for cohorts 1 and 2 
and 0.3- and 0.5-mg dose groups.  The in cidence of MI and non-ocular hemorrhage 
was similar across Cohort 1 dose groups .  APTC ATEs, including vascular and 
unknown deaths, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal cardiovascular accidents, were similar 
across dose groups.  During the 12-month study per iod, 0.7% of subjects in the 0.3-mg 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
13/P      15 November 2010 group and 1.2% of subjects in the 0.5-mg  group suffered a stroke.  The number of 
vascular deaths and deaths due  to unknown cause did not differ across dose groups.  
Rates of key non-ocular SAEs in Cohort 2 we re generally lower than those in Cohort 1.

2. OBJECTIVES  
This Phase I study will investigate the safe ty and tolerability of intravitreally 
administered Ranibizumab in th ree initial monthly doses of  2.0 mg followed by a 9 
month period of criteria- based, as-needed retreatment and 12 month off drug safety 
follow up in subjects with exudative polypoida l choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) for a total 
of [ADDRESS_1244624] corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 
specified time points in subjects treated with 2.0mg  intravitreal Ranibizumab. 
2. To investigate the occurrence of ocul ar non-serious and serious adverse events 
through fluorescein and ICG angiography, f undus photography, spectral domain 
optical coherence tomography (OCT ) at specified time points. 
3. To investigate the occurrence of ocul ar non-serious and serious adverse events 
through direct and indirect ophthalmic exam inations at specified time points.

Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
14/P      15 November 2010 Phase I Safety Study, Open-Label,  Single-Center, Non-Randomized, 
Uncontrolled, Consecutive Case-Series.  
Population and Sample- 
Random sample of 20 consecutive adults, age > 18 years, with polypoidal 
choroidal vasculopathy.  Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) will be 
defined as CNV with occult characteri stics on fluorescein angiography with 
saccular dilations and po lypoidal interconnecting  vascular channels on 
indocyanine green angiography and/or fl uorescein angiography.  PCV may be 
defined as a distinct clinic al syndrome if the  aneurysmal  dilatations are visible 
clinically as reddish-or ange and/or there are multiple  hemorrhagic PED’s. There 
may be some overlap with AMD in elderly  patients.  Elderly PCV patients may 
demonstrate drusen: however PCV may be  defined in elderly  patients when 
CNV is observed in peripap illary region, when drusen  are not prominent, and 
when the patient is non-whit e, especially in African Americans (the likely major 
racial predilection for PCV in  our patient population).    
 
2.0 mg  Ranibizumab cohort 
Twenty  eyes will be treated; PCV eyes ma y be treatment naïve or received 
previous PCV therapy great er than 30 days prior to enrollment.  A maximum of 
10 eyes that completed 24 month enrollmen t in our study evaluating 0.3 mg or 
0.5mg Ranibizumab may be included.   Eyes will be treated with 3 monthly 
doses of 2.0 mg ranibizu mab followed by 2.0mg ra nibizumab on a PRN dosing 
regimen for 9 months.   In the year 2 off drug treatment period subjects will be contact[CONTACT_888857] 18 and month 24.

3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
The route (intravitreal injections) and 2.0 mg dose employed is currently evaluated in 
the HARBOR clinical trial evaluating 2.0 mg  Ranibizumab in neovascular AMD.    The 
three consecutive monthly injections will be  followed by [CONTACT_888858].  Given th e variable course of PCV and unknown 
response to 2.0 mg Ranibizumab, this regi men will allow the opportunity to evaluate 
Ranibizumab’s safety and potenti al therapeutic efficacy, as well as to give the patient 
the opportunity to continue Ranibizumab or  switch to an alternative non-anti-VEGF 
therapy.  The  1 year duration of the study is of  sufficient duration to determine 
significant safety issues as well as determine potential efficacy.  The possible 
inclusion of patients completing month 24 fo llow up after receiving 0.3mg or 0.5 mg 
doses in our previous study, will determine significant safety issues as well as 
determine potential efficacy of the 2.0mg dose for this population, as well.   
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 
3.3.1 Primary Outcome Measure
 
The primary outcome measure for safety  and tolerability is the following: 
Incidence and severity of ocular and systemic  adverse events. Examples include 30 
letter loss, major subretinal hemorrhage,invo lving 75% or more of clinical macula 
(arcade to arcade), disease-related vitreous hemorrhage, injection-related 
endophthalmitis, retinal detac hment, vitreous hemorrhage , study drug/procedure  - 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
18/P      [ADDRESS_1244637] repo rting, and changes in vital signs. 
 
Secondary Outcome Measures  
• Month 3, 6, 9, [ADDRESS_1244638] corrected visual ac uity at 4 meters – rates for gain of 5, 10 
and 15  or more letters  
• Month 3, 6, 9, [ADDRESS_1244639] corrected visual ac uity at 4 meters-   rates for loss of 15 or 
more letters  
• Median and Average best corrected visual acuity at 4 mete rs- gain/loss (letters) at 
3,6,9,12 months. 
• Mean change from baseline in central foveal thickness over time up to [ADDRESS_1244640] 
• Mean change from baseline in macular volume overtime up to 12 months. 
• Proportion of patients with no evidence of fluid from  CNV as assessed by [CONTACT_214627] 
12 months. 
• Mean change from baseline in  the total area of CNV fluorescein angiographic 
leakage overtime up to 12 months. 
• Mean change from baseline in  total area of ICG CNV le sion size (including polyps 
and deep choroidal vessels) overtime up to 12 months. 
• Fluorescein and ICG angiograms and fundus photographs will also be graded at 
each time point compared to baseline as unchanged, resolved, improved, 
worsened, or cannot determine. For the FA and ICG evaluations, “resolved” will be 
defined as no leakage and no evidence of polyps or PCV choroidal lesion; 
“improved” will be defined as decreased leakage and/or decreased size, number, or hyperfluorescence of polyps and/or PC V choroidal lesion; and “worsened” will 
be defined as increased leakage and/or increased size, number or hyperfluorescence of polyps and/or PCV c horoidal lesion. For fundus photography 
evaluations, “resolved” will be defined as no evidence of PED, subretinal fluid, 
hemorrhage, or hard exudat e; improved will be defined as a decrease in PED, 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
19/P      [ADDRESS_1244641] exudate; and “worsened” will be defined 
increase in PED, subretinal fluid, he morrhage, fibrosis, or hard exudates. 
 
3.4 SAFETY PLAN 
The safety assessments to be conducted for th is study are listed in Section 4.5 and 
Appendix A. 
Serious adverse events of intravitreal injection such as endophthalmitis, retinal 
detachment and significant vitreous hemorrhage will be reported and monitored.  
Potential serious adverse events related to study drug such as significant uveitis, 
hypertension, thromboembolic event, or  poor wound healing will be reported and 
monitored.  Serious ocular adverse event s such as major subretinal hemorrhage, 
vitreous hemorrhage and 6-line loss rate wil l be reported and monitored.  Serious 
adverse events such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgeries, emergency room admissions and 
death will be reported and monitored.    
Given the small population studied in this Phase I trial, it will be difficult to estimate the 
adverse event occurrences.   Unmasking procedures or treatment recommendations related to drug or the study in particular  are not necessary.  Any death in the study 
population will lead to review and assessment while withholding drug injections for 
enrolled patients until fully revi ewed.  If two or more patients suffer thromboembolic 
events, drug injections will also be withheld for all enro lled patients until review and 
assessment occur.

(serious and nonserious). For this protocol, an AE is any “on study ” untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, 
symptom, disease, syndrome, in tercurrent illness) that occurs in a study subject, 
regardless of the suspected c ause.  “On study” refers to  Day [ADDRESS_1244649] study 
visit. Unchanged, chronic conditions are NO T AEs and will not be recorded.  An 
exacerbation or worsening of a chronic co ndition should be recorded as an AE. 
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
26/P      15 November 2010 Both serious and nonserious AEs should be graded on a three-point scale (mild, 
moderate, severe) and repor ted in detail in the subjects clinic record. 
The suggested definitions  are as follows:  
Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disrupt ion of normal daily activity 
Moderate : Discomfort sufficient to reduce or  affect normal daily activity 
Severe : Incapacitating with inability to work  or perform normal daily activity 
Using the following criteria, the investig ator will also assess whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that study drug caused or c ontributed to the AE. 
• Yes (possibly or probably) 
There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and study 
drug administration; and/or 
There is a biologically plausible mechanism for study drug causing or 
contributing to the AE; and 
• No  
The AE may or may not be attributed to  concurrent/underly ing illness, other 
drugs, or procedures. 
A clinically plausible tem poral sequence is inconsist ent with the onset of the AE 
and study drug adminis tration; and/or 
A causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.

worsen in intensity or frequency during the tr eatment or post-treat ment periods should 
be reported and recorded as AEs.

study assessments.) 
 
5.4 VITAL SIGNS 
Blood pressure will be measur ed at protocol-specified study  visits (see Section 3.1).    
 
5.5 PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING AND REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.5.1 Recording Adverse Events (see examples below)  
To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE da ta, investigators should 
observe the following guidelines: 
• Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording AEs.  Do 
not use colloquialisms and/or abbreviations. 
• If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than 
component signs and symptoms (e.g., reco rd congestive heart failure rather 
than dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis).  However, signs and symptoms that are 
considered unrelated to  an encountered syndrome or  disease should be 
recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe 
headache are observed at the same time, each events should be recorded as 
an individual AE). 
• AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified 
by [CONTACT_86187].  A “primary” AE, if clearly identifiable, generally 
represents the most accurate clinical term recorded.  If a primary serious AE 
(SAE) is recorded, events occurring seconda ry to the primary event should be 
described as a narrative description of the case.   
Protocol:   FVF4916s Final  
28/P      15 November 2010  
For example: 
Orthostatic 
hypotension → Fainting and fall to 
floor → Head trauma → Neck pain 
The primary AE is orthostatic hypotension. 
 
5.5.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE occurring at any dose  (including overdose) should be classified as SERIOUS  
if: 
• It resulted in death (i.e., t he AE caused or led to death). 
• It was life threatening (i.e., the AE plac ed the subject at immediate risk of 
death; it does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe). 
• It required or prolonged inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the AE required at least a 
24-hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888853] a hosp italization beyond the 
expected length of stay; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888854]/surgical 
procedures, scheduled treatments, or rout ine check-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_46668]). 
• It was disabling (i.e., the AE resulted in a substantial disrupti on of the subject’s 
ability to carry out normal life functions). 
• It resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adv erse outcome in a 
child or fetus of a subject exposed to  the molecule or study drug prior to 
conception or during pregnancy). 
• It does not meet any of the above se rious criteria but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.

Pre-Injection Procedures for All Patients 
The following procedures will be used to mini mize the risk of potential adverse 
events associated with intravitreal inje ctions (e.g., endophthalmitis).  Aseptic 
technique will be observed by [CONTACT_888874], 
anesthetic preparation, and study dr ug (ranibizumab) preparation and 
administration.  In addition to  the procedures outlined belo w, any additional safety 
measures in adherence to specific institut ional policies associat ed with intravitreal 
injections will be observed. 
The following procedures (except where noted) will be conducted by [CONTACT_888875].  Patients will self-administer 
antimicrobials (e.g., ofloxaci n ophthalmic solution [Ocuflox®], gatifloxacin ophthalmic 
solution [Zymar®], moxifloxacin opht halmic solution [Vigamox®], or 
trimethoprim-polymyxin B opht halmic solution [Polytrim®]) four times daily for 3 days 
prior to treatment. 
At the discretion of the investigator, the sites may use either ophthalmic drops 
or lidocaine injection for study eye anesthesia. 
If using propacaine- or tetracaine-bas ed ophthalmic drops for anesthesia, the 
injecting physician or technician (if applic able) assembles the supplies and prepares 
a sterile field.  Supplies include 10% povid one iodine swabs, sterile surgical gloves, 
4 × 4 sterile pads, a pack of sterile cotton-tipp ed applicators, eyelid speculum, sterile 
ophthalmic drape, 5% povidone iodine ophthalmic solution, ophthalmic antimicrobial 
solution (e.g., ofloxacin ophthalmic soluti on, trimethoprim-polymyxin B ophthalmic 
solution, moxifloxacin opht halmic solution, or gatiflo xacin ophthalmic solution  
single-use vial), and injection supplies.  Note:  The use of generic formulations or 
next-generation formulations of the antim icrobials listed above is permitted.  
Procedure for Propacaine- or Tetracaine-Based Anesthesia:  
• Instill two drops proparacaine or tetrac aine-based ophthalmic drops into the 
study eye, followed by [CONTACT_888876] (e.g., ofloxacin 
ophthalmic solution, trimet hoprim-polymyxin B ophthalmic solution, moxifloxacin 
ophthalmic solution, or gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution single-use vial).

Preparation and Administration  of Ranibizumab Injection 
The injecting physician will prepare the ranibi zumab injection as outlined below.   
Vials of ranibizumab in aqueous soluti on should remain refrigerated at 2 °C−8°C (36 °F−46°F) until just prior to use.  DO 
NOT FREEZE vials.  Protect from  direct light.  Do not use bey ond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  Dose solutions should be prepared 
immediately before dosing.  Dose solutions are for single use only. 
After preparing the study eye as outli ned in Appendix B, withdraw 0.2-mL r anibizumab dose solution through a 5- μm filter 
needle.  Remove the filter needle, replace it with a 30-gauge, 1/2-in ch Precision Glide® needle, and expel excess 
ranibizumab  so that the syringe cont ains 0.[ADDRESS_1244663]-
injection procedures. 
All injection materials (i.e., syringes, needles) will be disc arded in a sharps container immediately following each 
ranibizumab injection.  The ranibizum ab drug kit (including the used vial) will be sealed by [CONTACT_888878] “Do Not Tampe r” seal provided in the drug kit.  
A patient’s study eye will be monitored wit h a finger count test within 15 minutes of the ranibizumab injection by [CONTACT_24201].  A measurement  of IOP in the study eye will be obtained 30 ( ±5) minutes post-injection.  If the IOP is increased 
≥ 10 mmHg compared with the pr e-injection IOP, then measure the IOP again at 60 ( ±10) minutes.  The following table 
provides specific instructions fo r the preparation and administration ranibizumab in aqueous solution.

Analysis of Similar Events Te mplate for IND Safety Reports 
 
IND Safety Report 
Case Summary 
This section will be initiated by a research coordinator and may be modified by [CONTACT_888879].  The case summar y should describe the reported AE in detail, 
including a description of what happened and a su mmary of all relevant clinical information 
(e.g. medical status prior to the event, signs, symptoms, diagnoses, clinical course, treatment, 
outcome, etc.)  The IND safety report should not identify the subject ID #, reporting 
investigator, or the site as this information may compromise the study blind. 
 PREVIOUS REPORTS  
The information for this section comes from Prin cipal Investigator and the search of similar 
events.  This section should be written by  [CONTACT_888880]. 
 
*  Select one of the following two  statements after reviewing the search of similar events 
results. 
Under IND _______(insert IND#), the following IND safety reports of similar AEs have been 
previously submitted: 
MCN Reported Event Submission Date 
   
   
   
 
     O r  
 
Under IND _______ (insert IND#), no IND safety  reports of similar AEs have been submitted 
previously. 
In addition to previously submitted IND safety reports of similar events, this section can also 
summarize pervious serious reports of the same /similar event that were considered unrelated 
to the investigational product at the time of t he reporting.  These events would remain blinded, 
unless a decision to unblind is made by [CONTACT_888881].  The decision on what similar events to summarize in this section should be 
made after reviewing  the similar events report generated by [CONTACT_112892].  If a 
safety signal is particularly  worrisome (e.g., a study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112840]), a more extensive 
evaluation may be required.

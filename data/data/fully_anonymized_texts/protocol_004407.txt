Introduction
6. Background and rationale
6a. Description of research question and justification for undertaking the trial
Including summary of relevant studies (published and unpublished) examining benefits
and harms for each intervention
Sexual assault (SA) is one of the most common forms of trauma (Kilpatrick et
al., 2013) and it is associated with substantially increased risk for mental disorders
including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and high-risk drinking (Campbell,
Dworkin, & Cabral, 2009; Dworkin et al., 2017). The interplay between these
conditions may prolong symptoms of posttraumatic stress (Kaysen et al., 201 1; Stewart
et al., 2000; Zlotnick et al., 2004). These conditions pose a major public health burden,
including significant economic costs to individuals and the healthcare system
(Bouchery et al., 2006; Suris et al., 2004). In light of these consequences, attention has
been increasingly paid to intervention strategies early post-trauma to prevent
longer-term psychopathology (Dworkin & Schumacher, 2016). Other research has
focused on use of technology to increase reach of evidence-based treatments for PTSD
and high-risk drinking. Although two technology-based early interventions have shown
promise in addressing substance use and PTSD after trauma, neither has tar geted adult
survivors who do not present for medical treatment.
Targeting social interactions (i.e., frequency and perceptions of interaction,
engagement in social drinking) is one potential means by [CONTACT_823081]-risk drinking  and PTSD in trauma-exposed women. High social
support is a strong protective factor against PTSD (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine,
2000; Ozer et al., 2003; Wagner, Monson, & Hart, 2016) and high-risk drinking
(Stockdale et al., 2007; Moak & Agrawal, 2009), and social support can buffer the
effects of certain life stressors on drinking (Johnson & Jennison, 1994; Peirce et al.,
1996). Social contexts discourage or encourage drinking (George & Tucker, 1996;
McCrady, 2004) via promoting healthier copi[INVESTIGATOR_823061] (Cooper
et al., 1992; Humphreys et al., 1999), and encouraging those with drinking problems to
seek help (George & Tucker, 1996). In trauma-exposed women with PTSD, lack of
perceived social support is associated with more same-day drinking (Stappenbeck et
al., 2015) and peer encouragement of drinking is associated with higher drinking
consequences (Bachrach & Read, 2017). Thus, increasing alcohol-free contact [CONTACT_823082]-trauma. However, negative social reactions to
SA disclosure (e.g., victim blame) are associated with increased risk for high-risk
drinking  in cross-sectional (Ullman et al., 2008) and longitudinal studies
(Peter-Hagene & Ullman, 2014), indicating the need for interventions that buffer these
iatrogenic effects. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_823062], no intervention has tar geted social contexts
and support as a means of preventing high-risk drinking  after SA.
Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop and examine the feasibility of a
web-based cognitive-behavioral intervention to prevent the development of PTSD and
HRD in recently-victimized adults.
6b. Explanation for choice of comparators
The goal of this project is to obtain preliminary data regarding the ef fects of the
intervention. Thus, we selected an assessment-only control condition, while controlling
for daily app use and weekly contact [CONTACT_4490] a coach.
7.Objectives
Aim 3 (Assess participant reaction to the intervention)
●(H1) most participants will respond positively on items assessing satisfaction with the
intervention
●(H2) participants will report above-average usability on a standardized measure
●(H3) completion rates for daily activities will be similar to previous web-based
interventions.
Aim 4 (Assess the impact of the intervention on learning and symptoms)
●(H4) participants will show significant learning as evidenced by [CONTACT_823083]
●(H5) participants in the intervention condition will evidence less high-risk drinking and

Description of study settings
Although the intervention will be conducted online, participants will be recruited from
the Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA Metropolitan Statistical Area (defined by [CONTACT_823084]). According to the 2018 American Community Survey, this represents
3,939,363 people. The median age of the population in this area is 37, and the
population is 50% female. The population is 62% White, 14% Asian, 10% Hispanic,
6% Black, 6% two or more races/ethnicities, and 2% other. The median per-capi[INVESTIGATOR_823063] $46,204, and the median household income is $87,910. The majority of
individuals in this area (92.9%) are high-school graduates, and 43.6% have a bachelor ’s
degree or higher.Reference to where list of study sites can be obtained

11. Interventions
11a. Interventions for each group with sufficient detail to allow replication,
including how and when they will be administered
Intervention
The intervention is a phone app (“THRIVE”) intended to be used daily for [ADDRESS_1141394] complete an onboarding process that orients them to the
app, the daily surveys, and the tasks and activities that they will be asked to
complete daily. They will then complete two onboarding activities: one for the
behavioral activation component (in which they generate an initial list of
self-care activities), and one for the cognitive restructuring component (in
which they learn about stuck points).
The dashboard of the app will contain:
●A banner indicating the consecutive days that participants have
completed activities
●A link to an activity involving behavioral activation emphasizing
engagement with alcohol-free social activities, which they will complete
daily
●A link to activity involving cognitive restructuring skills with an
emphasis on mitigating the harm of cognitive distortions arising from
negative social reactions and other social factors, which they will
complete daily
●A link to relationship-targeted activities that complement the
behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring skills, which will be
completed as needed
●A link to a survey, which they will complete daily
●A link to a “mood tracker” that charts responses to daily surveys
●A link to resources
Coach
●The coach will check in weekly by [CONTACT_823087]:
○Check on mood
○Troubleshoot activity completion (e.g., help participants learn
how to address a difficult stuck point)
○Assist with issues related to use of the app itself (e.g., technical
issues, glitches)
○Provide resources as needed
○Monitor and encourage intervention engagementComparison
Participants will first complete an onboarding process that orients them to the
app and the daily surveys.
The dashboard of the app will contain:
●A banner indicating the consecutive days that participants have
completed their survey
●A link to their survey, which they will complete daily
●A link to a “mood tracker” that charts responses to daily surveys
●A link to resources
Coach
●The coach will check in weekly by [CONTACT_17084]/or Zoom and will do the
following:
○Check on mood
○Assist with issues related to use of the app itself (e.g., technical
issues, glitches)
○Provide resources as needed
11b. Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions for a given trial
participant
Participants who withdraw consent for participation should no longer be contact[CONTACT_823088].
11c. Strategies to improve adherence to intervention protocols, and any procedures
for monitoring adherence
The phone screener will:
●Discuss the process of randomization to a condition with the participant.
●Emphasize that the app will be offered at the end of the baseline survey, so they
must finish the survey to access the app.
Given evidence that human contact [CONTACT_823089], we will
provide participants in both conditions with ongoing phone coaching. All screened
participants, regardless of randomization or condition, will get one phone or Zoom call
from a coach to ensure that app installation and onboarding were successful (if
randomized), answer questions (for all participants), encourage adherence to surveys (if
randomized), and provide resources (if not randomized). This call will be scheduled
during the phone screening and will occur within 3 business days of screening. The
coach will be informed of the individual’s condition before the call.
Participants in both conditions will be offered three additional weekly phone/text/Zoom
check-ins with their coach to troubleshoot progress and skill application (intervention
condition only), check in on overall well-being (both conditions), encourage daily
survey completion (both conditions), monitor risk (both conditions), and troubleshoot
technical difficulties (both conditions). Coaches will be able to access participant data
(e.g., activity data, time spent in the app, self-report data) prior to the weekly
appointment.11d. Relevant concomitant care and interventions that are permitted or prohibited
during the trial
Participants will not be restricted from accessing any care or interventions during the
course of the trial. It is likely that individuals recruited from the Harborview Center for
Sexual Assault and Traumatic Stress (a primary recruitment site) will receive treatment
for sexual-assault-related distress while enrolled in the study.

13. Participant timeline
14. Sample size
Estimated number of participants needed to achieve study objectives
n= 20 in intervention condition; n= [ADDRESS_1141395] information about feasibility; thus, the sample size
was set for practical reasons rather than detecting effect sizes or significance testing. A
control group was included to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_823064], and we will have

statistical power of 0.[ADDRESS_1141396] size of count ratio of 1.40, based on a mean
base rate RAPI [INVESTIGATOR_823065] 6 in untreated women from a preliminary
study (R21AA016211 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_823066]).
15. Recruitment
Strategies for achieving adequate participant enrollment to reach target sample size
Participants will enter the trial through one of [ADDRESS_1141397] to monitor their symptoms and build copi[INVESTIGATOR_823067]. Potential participants will be informed that all eligible participants will receive symptom
monitoring, some participants will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_823068] , and some will be offered
the copi[INVESTIGATOR_447894] 3 months.

emergency department) contact [CONTACT_823090] 10 weeks of an assault requesting a
therapy appointment will be provided a brief study description and the study phone
number over the phone by [CONTACT_823091].
2. Sexual assault survivors presenting for care at the emergency department-
Approximately 2-25 individuals per week present to Seattle-area emer gency
departments for care related to a recent sexual assault. HATC social workers attempt to
follow up with all survivors over the phone and schedule in-person follow-up sessions
with a social worker (Maria) and a SANE (Annette) for 1-[ADDRESS_1141398] the registrar’s

Facebook targeting Seattle-area women, and at the King County Sexual Assault
Resource Center in Renton.
Methods: Assignment of Interventions (for Controlled Trials)
16. Allocation
16a. Sequence generation
Method of generating the allocation sequence (eg, computer-generated random numbers)
and list of any factors for stratification. To reduce predictability of a random sequence,
details of any planned restriction (eg, blocking) should be provided in a separate
document that is unavailable to those who enroll participants or assign intervention.Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control via a
computer-generated randomization schedule. Randomization will not be
stratified.
16b. Allocation concealment mechanism
Randomization will occur without human involvement; therefore, no allocation
concealment method will be needed.
16c. Implementation
Who will generate the allocation sequence, who will enroll participants, and who will
assign participants to interventions
Participants will be preliminarily screened for the study over the phone by a study staf f
person. The staff person will then give them a web link to complete the baseline survey.
Participants will then complete the baseline survey online by [CONTACT_1029], which will
confirm eligibility. Participants will not be able to retake the baseline survey. At the
end of the survey, they will be informed of their eligibility status, and if eligible,
intervention condition (randomization will occur within the survey), and be directed to
log into the app.
17. Blinding (masking)
17a. Who will be blinded after assignment to interventions (eg, trial participants,
care providers, outcome assessors, data analysts), and how
Due to the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor study staf f can be blinded
to allocation. Baseline and follow-up assessments will occur via self-report; thus, no
blinding of staff assessors is needed.
17b. If blinded, circumstances under which unblinding is permissible, and
procedure for revealing a participant’s allocated intervention during the trial

Methods: Data Collection, Management, and Analysis
18. Data collection methods
18a. Plans for assessment and collection of outcome, baseline, and other trial data
Participants will complete online self-report surveys at baseline, daily during the
intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Participants will be paid $20,
$40, and $[ADDRESS_1141400]-baseline surveys, respectively. Participants will be paid $3 per day of survey
completion (daily participation will be incentivized to make daily data analysis
possible) and $[ADDRESS_1141401]-intervention and 3-month
follow-up assessments will assess changes in learning (i.e., increases in correct
responses to items reflecting knowledge about intervention concepts) and symptoms.18b. Plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up
List of any outcome data to be collected for participants who discontinue or deviate fr om
intervention protocols
The following steps will be taken to promote retention:
●We will collect extensive contact [CONTACT_823092]-up assessments unless directed otherwise.
●The daily surveys will be accessed from within the app, which is intended to
increase the likelihood that participants complete both surveys and activities
●Participants can opt in to  receive a text from the app prompting them to
complete a survey.
●Participants will be paired with a coach, who will remind them to complete
baseline and post-intervention surveys
●Participants will receive reminders from study staff to complete the baseline,
post-intervention, and 3 month surveys.
●Participants will be paid $3 per day of survey completion (daily participation
will be incentivized to make daily data analysis possible) and $10 bonus for
completion of 7 consecutive days. Participants will be paid $20, $40, and $60
for participation in each assessment (at baseline, termination, and [ADDRESS_1141402]-termination), respectively. Total possible remuneration will be $213 for
both conditions. Participants will be paid for each survey and assessment they
complete, even if they do not complete all assessments.
●The screener will emphasize the importance of completing both daily surveys
and daily intervention tasks if assigned to the intervention.
●The screener will instruct participants to complete the baseline survey once they
terminate the phone call.
19. Data management
Plans for data entry, coding, security, and storage
Including any related processes to promote data quality (eg, double data entry; range
checks for data values). Reference to where details of data management procedures can
be found, if not in the protocol.
Entry and coding
Data will be completely digital; no data entry will be needed. In some cases,
scale scores will be automatically calculated by [CONTACT_823093]. When this does
not occur, the first author will create SPSS syntax and a data dictionary referencing
scoring procedures.
Security and storage
All data will be identified only by a Personalized Identification Number (PIN).
Data will be collected using a secure server. Electronic protection is provided by a
commercial-grade firewall, with continuous monitoring of the server for any attempts
at electronic invasion. The password to the account will only be known to the Principal
Investigator, Mentors, and other relevant research staff. All data stored in the online
repository will be encrypted. A master list of names and PI[INVESTIGATOR_813441] a
password-protected database under the supervision of the Principal Investigator , and
will be available only to research staff on this project. Research assistants will receive
training that includes emphasis upon the importance of confidentiality of information,
and all personnel on the project (including graduate and undergraduate research
assistants and study staff) will complete the required NIH training in protection of
human research participants. All staff will sign confidentiality statements. Data will be
retained on computers with restricted and password protected access, without links to
the master code list. All data based on this research will be reported in aggregate form.
No individual respondents will be identified.
The link between identifiers and the research data will be destroyed after the
records retention period required by [CONTACT_52925]/or federal law.20. Statistical methods
20a. Statistical methods for analyzing primary and secondary outcomes
Reference to where other details of the statistical analysis plan can be found, if not in the
protocol
Relevant to Aim 3 (Assess participant reaction to the intervention), the
hypothesis that most participants will respond positively on items assessing satisfaction
with the intervention (H1) will be assessed via descriptive statistics, visualizations, and
multilevel models; 95% CIs will determine whether satisfaction ratings are
significantly better than “neutral.” The hypothesis that participants will report
above-average usability on a standardized measure (H2) will be assessed via mean
scores on the System Usability Scale; 95% CIs will determine whether usability ratings
are significantly different from a score of 68/100 (indicating above-average usability).
The hypothesis that completion rates for daily activities will be similar to previous
web-based interventions (H3) will be tested via descriptive statistics, visualizations,
and multilevel models; 95% CIs will determine whether the number of days completed
is significantly different from 10 and the percent of days completed is significantly
different from 71.43%.
Relevant to Aim 4 (Assess the impact of the intervention on learning and
symptoms), as this study was not powered to detect all effects of interest, we rely
primarily on the direction and magnitude of effect sizes to interpret results and conduct
significance tests in an exploratory manner. The hypothesis that participants will show
significant learning as evidenced by [CONTACT_823094] (H4) will be tested via paired-samples t-tests. The
hypothesis that participants in the intervention condition will evidence less high-risk
drinking and PTSD at 3-month follow-up than participants in the assessment-only
condition (H5) will be tested via mixed-effects models. Because they are non-negative
discrete integers that typi[INVESTIGATOR_663703] a positive skew, Poisson or negative binomial
distributions will be examined. Dummy variables for the intervention condition with
the control as the reference will be included. We will examine time by [CONTACT_823095]-up.20b. Methods for any additional analyses
(eg, subgroup and adjusted analyses)
We may include additional covariates to increase precision or if there is evidence
that randomization did not adequately balance covariate distributions by [CONTACT_3004].
20c. Analysis population and missing data
Definition of analysis population related to nonadherence (eg, as randomized analysis),
and any statistical methods to handle missing data (eg, multiple imputation)
We will use an intent to treat analysis, in which participants will be retained in
the group to which they were originally randomized. Outcome data from all
participants will be included in analyses. We will also explore the use of
randomization-based efficacy estimators (White, 2005). We will use maximum
likelihood estimation for missing data.

Alternatively, an explanation of why a DMC is not needed
Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_823069], we will not
retain a data monitoring committee.
21b. Description of any interim analyses and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_823070]. We will employ the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_823071]: if there is clear evidence of harm. Although we do not expect
any physical harms or serious psychological harms beyond minimal distress, we have
several procedures for monitoring harm from the intervention, including asking
participants to contact [CONTACT_823096], of fering additional
resources to those with very high levels of mental health symptoms and problem
drinking that we identify through data monitoring, and providing resources after
baseline and at every follow-up time point. We do not expect there to be overwhelming
evidence of the harm of the intervention, but we will monitor this and stop the trial if
this is indicated. We also do not expect that there will be no likelihood of demonstrated
treatment benefit (futility) for the intervention as compared to control. 22. Harms
Plans for collecting, assessing, reporting, and managing solicited and spontaneously reported
adverse events and other unintended effects of trial interventions or trial conduct
Potential risks
Risks to the participants in the intervention are not substantial: they will receive a
combination of commonly-used evidence-based skills that are similar to those known to be
effective with PTSD and high-risk drinking and are thus unlikely to increase distress. The
sensitivity of some of the measures poses some psychological risk, as they may be somewhat
uncomfortable to complete.
Reports of suicidal ideation ethically require follow-up by [CONTACT_473], and could
potentially result in the need to violate confidentiality in order to protect the participants,
consistent with ethical guidelines and State and Federal regulations. Thus, this represents a
potential limit to confidentiality. It is possible that participants randomized to the assessment
only group may experience increased negative affect and alcohol use in their daily lives. At the
conclusion of their participation (3 month follow-up) participants who were assigned to the
assessment only group will be offered the web-based intervention. In addition, we will offer all
participants referrals for additional services. No participants will be excluded from seeking
additional services while part of this study.
Protection against risks
We recognize that this is a vulnerable population and have taken a number of steps to
protect the patients’ rights and welfare. Participants may refuse to answer questions or may
withdraw from the study at any time. Participants are also encouraged to content the
investigators at any time to discuss any concerns they might have. Dr . Dworkin is qualified to
provide referrals and address concerns related to psychological distress arising through
participation in this study.
Trained personnel will be present or on call when specific study procedures take place,
though we will make it clear to participants on consent documents and in emails that we may
not be able to return calls or emails received during the evening/night time until the next day .
Drs. Dworkin, Lee, and Kaysen have training in working with individuals with PTSD, alcohol
misuse, and with individuals with chronic and severe suicidality and thus is competent to
assess and intervene with these individuals. Drs. Lee, Kaysen, and Areán are well-versed in the
requirements and procedures for monitoring and reporting adverse events and complaints to
the IRB for review within [ADDRESS_1141403] for identifying and
referring individuals who report consumption of potentially lethal doses of alcohol (BACs
above .30). Specifically, all daily data will be screened immediately upon entry for indication
of significant risk based on criteria established in our prior trials of this nature. Dr . Dworkin
will be notified within [ADDRESS_1141404], if any, and whether the process will be
independent from investigators and the sponsor
No auditing will be conducted.
Ethics and Dissemination
24. Research ethics approval
Plans for seeking research ethics committee/institutional review board (REC/IRB) approval
We have obtained ethical approval from the University of Washington IRB.
25. Protocol amendments
Plans for communicating important protocol modifications (eg, changes to eligibility criteria,
outcomes, analyses) to relevant parties (eg, investigators, REC/IRBs, trial participants, trial
registries, journals, regulators)Any modifications to the protocol which could impact the conduct of the study , potential
benefits to the participants or participant safety, including changes to study objectives, study
design, target population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative aspects,
will require a formal amendment to the protocol. This amendment will be approved by [CONTACT_823097] [INVESTIGATOR_823072].
Administrative changes (i.e., minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no ef fect on the
way the study is conducted) will be documented by [CONTACT_978], and approved by [CONTACT_823098].
26. Consent or assent
26a. Who will obtain informed consent or assent from potential trial participants or
authorized surrogates, and how (see Item 32)
During the phone screening, the research staff person will explain the screening process
and the broader study and obtain verbal informed consent for screening. Participants
will complete a separate electronic consent form on their own for the baseline
assessment that again presents information about the broader study and involves
consent to be randomized and participate in the intervention. Electronic consent will
again occur at the follow-up assessments.26b. Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and
biological specimens in ancillary studies, if applicable
N/A
27. Confidentiality
How personal information about potential and enrolled participants will be collected, shared,
and maintained in order to protect confidentiality before, during, and after the trial
All participants will be informed of exceptions to confidentiality (i.e., current, imminent
suicidality/homicidality; current child abuse, elder abuse) both verbally and in the written
consent form at their initial baseline evaluation. Participants will be informed that in cases of
reported current threat to safety to either self or others, or abuse of a vulnerable population,
mandatory reporting laws apply and confidentiality may be broken in order to ensure safety .
We need to retain phone numbers and other contact [CONTACT_823099]-up assessments. We will retain this contact [CONTACT_69981] a
locked filing cabinet and password protected computer system (described above). These data
will not be shared with individuals who are not directly involved in the study .
All data will be identified only by a PIN. All participant data will be coded in a way that does
not contain any participant identifiers. Measures will be administered in order to collect data
on participants’ demographic information, trauma history, life events, substance use,
psychiatric status, and emotional experiences. All of the data will be recorded and maintained
on file for purposes of analysis and will be used only for research purposes. Files will be kept
in locked file cabinets and only on password protected computers, both of which will be in
locked rooms. The linkage code will be kept in a locked file and a computer file with restricted
access and will not be available to the public or individuals not directly involved in the
research. We will maintain the link for [ADDRESS_1141405] is required. .
Data will be collected using a secure server. IP address is not stored, and data are identified
only by [CONTACT_813454], not the participant’s name. Data transfer will be encrypted. This is the same
level of encryption used for online banking transactions. The password to the account will only
be known to the Principal Investigator, Co-Investigators, and research coordinator. A master
list of names and code numbers will be stored in locked file cabinets and on a
password-protected computer under the supervision of the Principal Investigator , and will be
available only to research staff on this project. Research assistants will receive training that
includes emphasis upon the importance of confidentiality of information, and all personnel on
the project (including graduate and undergraduate research assistants and study staff) will
complete the required NIH training in protection of human research participants. All staff will

RISKS & BENEFITS
What are the risks of participating in this study? 
The main risks associated with participation in this study have to do with the sensitive and 
private nature of some of the questions. The surveys in this study and the app activities contain 
questions about your substance use, experience with stressful events, and psychological 
symptoms. These questions may make you feel uncomfortable or feel intrusive. In addition, you 
might feel distressed if someone were to improperly gain access to your responses. Here are 
some examples of the most sensitive items:
1. Someone had oral sex with me or made me have oral sex with them without my consent by 
[CONTACT_798886], for example holding me down with their body weight, pi[INVESTIGATOR_798856], or 
having a weapon.
2. How often have you been bothered by [CONTACT_433630], or that you are a failure, 
or have let yourself or your family down?
3. How much do you agree with the statement, “I am a weak person”?
You may also be asked questions about potentially illegal behaviors, such as illicit drug use and 
drinking under the legal age. While a breach of data security is unlikely, this may pose a risk if 
this is private information that you do not want others to know. 
Please remember that you do not have to answer any questions that you do not wish to and 
you may stop participation in the study at any time. 
If you are randomly selected for the part of the study involving learning and practicing 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_823076], there may be additional risks: 
●The copi[INVESTIGATOR_823077]’re having and could make 
you feel upset. Although these exercises are based on research about what is helpful, 
some people may not find them helpful. 
●When you use the app to practice copi[INVESTIGATOR_717436], you will be asked to answer private 
questions in the app. The app will store your answers. Only you, the research team, and 
your coach will be able to see your answers. We set it up this way so that your coach can 
help you make the most out of these exercises, and so we can understand how people are 
using the app. If someone else were to gain access to your phone, they could see your 
answers to these private questions. It is very important that you enable security 
protections on your phone, like a password or fingerprint scanner access, to prevent 
access to your answers. 
If you need assistance or have questions at any time, you can contact [CONTACT_3476].

What are the benefits to taking part in this study?
You may not experience any direct benefits from participating in this study, but you might 
learn more about yourself, your experience with stressful events, and your drinking as you go 
through this study, which could be helpful. You may also learn new copi[INVESTIGATOR_823078], negative emotions, and drinking.  
Your participation in this study may benefit other people who have experienced unwanted 
sexual contact [CONTACT_823102][INVESTIGATOR_823079].

PROTECTIONS AGAINST RISKS
How will I be protected against the risks to my privacy?
Participation in this research is voluntary, and you are free to skip over any questions you do not 
want to answer or to stop participating at any time.  
All of the information you provide will be confidential. Here is how we will protect your data:
●Your name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_823104]. It will be accessible only to 
research staff for the purposes of contact[CONTACT_823105]. That information will be stored separately from all of your 
answers to study questionnaires and all information you enter into the app. We will retain 
your name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_823106]/or federal law.
●Your responses to online surveys and anything you enter into the app will be stored using 
a secure server that provides the highest available level of protection for your 
confidentiality. These responses will be stored with a personal identification number 
(PIN) randomly generated for research purposes, not your name. Your PIN is kept 
separate from your personal information, so that none of your answers can be linked to 
anything that might identify you.  Only the researchers will know the PIN. 
We have a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal National Institutes of Health.  This 
helps us protect your privacy.  The Certificate means that we do not have to give out 
information, documents, or samples that could identify you even if we are asked to by a court of 
law.  We will use the Certificate to resist any demands for identifying information.  
We can’t use the Certificate to withhold your research information if you give your written 
consent to give it to an insurer, employer, or other person.  Also, you or a member of your family 
can share information about yourself or your part in this research if you wish.
There are some limits to this protection. We will voluntarily provide the information to:
a member of the federal government who needs it in order to audit or evaluate the 
research;
individuals at the institution(s) conducting the research, the funding agency, and other 
groups involved in the research, if they need the information to make sure the research is 
being done correctly;
the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), if required by [CONTACT_1622];
     Approved

individuals who want to conduct secondary research if allowed by [CONTACT_187179];
 authorities, if we learn of child abuse, elder abuse, or the intent to harm yourself or 
others. 
The Certificate expi[INVESTIGATOR_87554].  Currently this is 8/31/22.  
Any data collected after expi[INVESTIGATOR_187163].  Data collected prior to 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_87556].  
You will not be identified in any research reports or presentations of this research. Here are the 
situations where we would share data with people outside of the research team:
Data identified only by [CONTACT_813454] (not your name [CONTACT_122541] [CONTACT_3031]) may be shared with other 
researchers doing similar work on other campuses, be combined with data from other campuses 
in some research reports, and/or may be used to develop procedures used in future studies.  
These data will be retained indefinitely, identified only by [CONTACT_813454]. 
How will I be protected against the risk that I may be distressed?
If you become concerned about problems you’re experiencing related to stressful events or your 
drinking, or if you experience discomfort as a result of your participation, you can contact [CONTACT_823107]. We will be 
happy to provide referrals for substance use or mental health counseling services.  
You are free to participate in other mental health or alcohol-related programs such as support 
groups, treatment, therapy, etc. while involved in the study.  
Your coach will monitor any significant increases in your alcohol use during your study 
participation, and may reach out by [CONTACT_823108].

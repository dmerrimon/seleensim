Protocol Version: 7/01/[ADDRESS_343131]  cancer.  3-5 The U.S. Preventive  Services  
Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for women aged 40 -49 years, and 
recommen ds biennial screening for those aged 50 -74 years. 6 Conversely, the American Cancer 
Society (ACS) provides a qualified recommendation for the opportunity to initiate annual 
screening  mammography  for women  aged  40-[ADDRESS_343132] women’s decision making. 2,3,7- [ADDRESS_343133]  wall radiation  therapy,  and those  older  in age and with certain  modifiable 
risk factors are likely to benefit from screening mammography. 3-5Conversely, women at 
average risk may be more vulnerable to certain harms (i.e., physical and psychological harm, 
financial strain, opportunity costs) associated with screening. 11Physical harm may result from 
unnecessary follow -up tests (e.g., biopsies) following the detection of false -positive results 
(detection of a cancer in error) or from unnecessary treatment due to overdiagnosis (detection of cancer through screening that would not have caused symptoms or death). [ADDRESS_343134] estimates of 
incidence rates fo r overdiagnosis in screening mammography range from 19% -31%. 2,5,12- 20 
Women may also experience psychological harm, such as stress or anxiety, 21 and financial 
strain might stem from unexpected costs of follow -up tests, loss of income, and concerns about 
future possible costs. 11,22-  24Finally, women may experience opportunity costs by [CONTACT_281518] (e.g., self -care, leisure, professional) for further testing, treatment, or symptom 
management. [ADDRESS_343135] women’s ability to  make informed  decisions  about  whether  or not to undergo  
screening,  when  to initiate  screening, and screening frequency. 2,5,25 Women from underserved 
populations (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status [SES]) and those with low health literacy are at greater risk of misunderstanding screening guidelines, 11-[ADDRESS_343136]  cancer  screening  mammography  to racially/ethnically  diverse  women  with varying  levels 
of SES and health literacy. There is an urgent need for formative resea rch to better understand 
these issues. Findings will inform strategies to support clinicians in communicating and individualizing  discussion  of the benefits  and harms  of screening,  and will ultimately  help enhance 
women’s ability to make informed decisions  about screening mammography. This is critical, as 
informed decision making takes into account empi[INVESTIGATOR_281513]’ values and preferences, and is associated with better knowledge about screening guidelines and the benefits, 
Protocol Version: 7/01/[ADDRESS_343137] and anxiety, greater satisfaction with

process. 35,36

3.0 PATIENT  SELECTION  
 
3.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
 
1. Latina, Black, or non- Latina White  woman  
2. Age between 40 and 49 years old (inclusive)  
3. Able to write , read, and understand English  
 
3.[ADDRESS_343139]  cancer,  defined  as any of the following:  
a. Self-reported personal history of breast cancer (invasive, ductal carcinoma in situ 
[DCIS], or lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS]) 
b. Self-reported personal history of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_281514]  
c. Self-reported first degree family member with history of breast cancer ( parent, 
sibling)  
d. Self-reported known underlying genetic mutation (such as BRCA1/BRCA2 gene)  
e. Self-reported prior thoracic or chest wall radiation therapy  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Latina, Black, or non- Latina White women are eligible for this tria l. Women of other races 
are not eligible.  
 
 
4.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
This study  will register  summary  accrual  statistics  to the Siteman  Cancer  Center  OnCore  Database. 
On a quarterly basis, accrual should  be  grouped  according  to  the  demographic  data  
collected. Demographic information includes gender, age, ethnicity, and race. If any pi[INVESTIGATOR_281515], choose  unknown. 
Protocol Version: 7/01/21 Page 7   1. In OnCore, navigate to the PC Console for this study and enter the dates of the quarter for 
which you are entering accrual statistics. (These dates must be inclusive of the same year, e.g. 1/1/2020 – 3/31/2020, not 12/31/2019 – 3/31/2020.)  
2. Then, enter the accrual number for any subjects who are in the same demographic gro ups 
of race,  ethnicity,  gender,  and age group. For example,  if you have  accrued  two white  non- 
Hispanic males in their 50s, you will enter that demographic as an accrual group of 2. If you have also accrued an Asian female in her 40s, you will enter her as  a separate accrual 
group (you would enter “1” for the accrual  number).  
3. In addition, you will enter  “Research  Center” in the drop- down  field for “Internal  Accruing 
Reporting Group” and “No disease” in the drop- down field for “Disease Site.”

5.[ADDRESS_343140] randomization, measures, and recruitment.  
 
Following this preliminary evaluation of the decision tool and feasibility testing, 198 participants  will be randomized on a 1:[ADDRESS_343141] cancer screening education. Black, Latina, and Non- Latina 
White participants will be assigned to either the control or intervention condition using 4 and 2 varying block size. They will complete the pr e-questionnaire, review the decision 
support tool/control condition, and complete the  post-questionnaire.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_343142] -to-reach groups. Qualtrics’ sample partners 
randomly select respondents for surveys where respondents are likely to qualify. All strategic sample partners use deduplication technology to provide the most reliable results and retain the integrity of the surv ey data.  
 
Written informed consent is not required; participants will receive an information sheet, and continued participation (completion of questionnaires, review of materials) will be construed as consent.  
Protocol Version: 7/01/21 Page 8    
5.2.2 Randomization  
 
The sample  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_98680]/ethnic subgroups  (Black,  Non-White  Latina, 
White) for randomization purposes. Participants in these subgroups will be 
randomized to either the intervention or control arm on a 1:1 basis using 4 and 2 varying block size. The Washingt on University School of Medicine research team 
will create the randomization table.  Qualtrics  will program  the randomization table 
into the  survey.  
 
5.2.3 Participation  
 
Measures will elicit participants’ perceptions of the tool (Appendix A)/control condition (Appendix B). These measures assess acceptability and informed choice 
using knowledge, attitudes, intentions, priorities, and values.  
 
Pre-tool/control condition questionnaires are:  
• Sociodemographic characteristics (Appendix  J) 
• Knowledge  of Screening  Mammo graphy  Guidelines  and Perceived  Benefits 
and Harms of Screening Mammography (Appendix  D) 
• Decision  Conflict  Scale (which  collects  feelings  of being  fully  informed  and 
clear about the importance of the components for making informed decisions) (Appendix  E) 
• Decision Self -Efficacy (Appendix  F) 
 
Post-tool/control condition questionnaires are:  
• Acceptability (Appendix  G) 
• Preparation for Decision Making Scale (Appendix H) 
• Decision Conflict  Scale  
• Decision  Self-Efficacy  
• Knowledge  of Screening  Mammography  Guidelines  and Perceived  Benefits 
and Harms of Screening  Mammography  
• Health literacy and health numeracy (Appendix  I) 
 
5.2.4 Data Scrubbing  
 
After data collection, records will be removed from the final data set if they meet any of the following criteria as determined by [CONTACT_8362]. Members of the research team will keep track of how many records were removed and for what reason(s).  
 Criteria for removal from the final data set:  
• The participants do not meet all of the inclusion criteria; or  
• The time to co mplete the questionnaire is less than half of the median time 
to complete the questionnaire across the full data set; or  
• Participants do not respond to, provide nonsensical or incomprehensible answers to, or give responses in a language other than English to at least 
Protocol Version: 7/01/21 Page 9   four of the eight following knowledge questions:  
o 2.12 Tell me in your own words, what is a mammogram?  
o 2.24. What is meant by [CONTACT_123473] "overdetection" (also called 
“overdiagnosis”)? Please answer in English. If you are not sure, just guess.  
o 2.26. What are some of the benefits of breast cancer screening mammograms? Please answer in English.  
o 2.27. What are the risks or downsides of breast cancer screening mammograms? Please answer in English.  
o 3.49. Tell me in your own words, what is a breast cance r screening 
mammogram? Please answer in English  
o 3.61. What is meant by [CONTACT_123473] "overdetection" (also called “overdiagnosis”)? Please answer in English. If you are not sure, just guess.  
o 3.63. What are some of the benefits of breast cancer screening mammogr ams? Please answer in English.  
o 3.64. What are the risks or downsides of breast cancer screening mammograms? Please answer in English.  
 If a participant completes the questionnaire in less than half the median time, it is reasonable to believe that they were unable to process the decision aid(s) in sufficient detail to provide accurate responses to the questions.   Failing to adequately co mplete the knowledge questions (4 of which are pre -
tool/control and [ADDRESS_343143] -tool/control) limit the research team’s ability to accurately 
analyze the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and limited -efficacy of the 
tool/control.  
6.0       STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Stratification will be based on racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Latina, Black, non- Latina White). For 
adequate power, 66 participants from each racial/ethnic group will be enrolled and randomized (198 total). 
 
For knowledge, previous  research  show s that mean  knowledge  score  is 57 out of 100.36 
Compared to usual  care,  decision  aids increased  knowledge  13 points  (mean  difference 13.34 out 
of 100; 95% CI [11.17,15.51]).[ADDRESS_343144] scale (0 -100), those using a decision aid 
were more informed by 7 points (mean difference: - 7.26 of 100; 95% CI [ -9.73, -4.78]), and 
were more clear  
Protocol Version: 7/01/21 Page 10   about their personal values by 6 points (mean difference: - 6.09; 95% CI [ -8.50, -3.67]).36 Finally, 
fewer were passive in decision -making (risk ratio 0.66; 95% CI [0.53 to 0.81]).[ADDRESS_343145], a sample size of 33 provides 80% power at the 0.05 significance level 
(alpha) to detect a mean knowledge difference of [ADDRESS_343146] deviation (SD)  of 
20, and to de tect a mean decision conflict score difference of 6.[ADDRESS_343147], a sample size of 33 provides 80% power at the 0.05 
significance level (alpha) to detect a risk ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_343148] the differences between groups with 80% power and 5% Type I error, [ADDRESS_343149].  We are making  multiple  comparisons  and recognize that  the overall  Type  I error rate in  this 
study will be greater than 5%. However, this study will allow us to collect adequate data, for planning f uture large scale studies.  
  
7.[ADDRESS_343150]  that the occurrence of a serious  adverse event  as it relates 
to these study interventions to be extremely rare. If a breach of confidentiality were to occur, it would be reported to QASMC and HRPO within 10 days of  notification.  
 
7.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
The study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_281516]. Once the PI [INVESTIGATOR_281517] a reportable adverse event, the event will be reported to HRPO and QASMC accordi ng to institutional guidelines. This study does not require 
QASMC audit or submission of DSM reports. 
 
7.3 Remuneration  
 
Participants will be compensated through Qualtrics for being a research participant.

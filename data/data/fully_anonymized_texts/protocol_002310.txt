Title A Multi-Center, Randomized, Double-Masked, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2b 
Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of NCX 4251 (Fluticasone Propi[INVESTIGATOR_793020]) Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.1% QD for the Treatment of Acute 
Exacerbations of Blepharitis (Mississippi) 
Study No. NCX-4251-02  
Sponsor Nicox Ophthalmics, Inc. 
Background and 
Rationale  NCX 4251 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_793021]) Ophthalmic Suspension is a sterile, 
preserved, topi[INVESTIGATOR_793022]-dose ophthalmic dropper bottles, and is being developed for the 
treatment of acute exacerbations of blepharitis by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_793023]. Nicox Ophthalmics, Inc. (Nicox) 
developed a novel formulation and route of delivery consisting of applying 
NCX 4251 directly to the eyelids designed to minimize the intraocular exposure to 
fluticasone. 
The safety and tolerability of NCX 4251 ophthalmic suspension, 0.1% in subjects 
with an acute exacerbation of blepharitis and signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease was evaluated in a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-
controlled, two-cohort, phase 2 study (NCX-4251-01). In Cohort 1 of the study, 
15 subjects with ongoing active signs and symptoms of blepharitis evidenced by 
[CONTACT_793069], eyelid redness and eyelid debris accompanied by 
[CONTACT_793070] 4251 
ophthalmic suspension 0.1% or placebo (2:1 ratio, 10 subjects on NCX 4251 and 
5 subjects on placebo). Subjects additionally performed daily eyelid scrubs with 
baby [CONTACT_793071] (QD) for 14 days, followed by a 14-day 
eyelid scrubs only safety follow-up period. In Cohort 2, 21 subjects were 
randomized to NCX 4251 Ophthalmic Suspension 0.1% twice daily (BID) or 
placebo BID (1:1 ratio) and performed daily lid scrubs with baby [CONTACT_793072] 14 days, followed by a 14-day eyelid scrubs only safety follow-up 
period. The interim analysis performed on Cohort 1 indicated that NCX 4251 and 
the new route of administration were well tolerated, and that no clinically relevant 
intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations were observed in the study. Although the 
study was not powered for efficacy, changes in magnitude of clinical relevance 
were observed in signs and symptoms of blepharitis and dry eye.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blepharitis, a chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelid margin, is one of the 
most common ocular disorders seen by [CONTACT_793073] a significant impact on ocular comfort and quality of life (Buchholz, 2006; 
Duncan, 2015). It often has a chronic manifestation with intermittent exacerbations 
defined by [CONTACT_793074]. Signs and symptoms of blepharitis include 
burning, itchiness, gritty feeling in the eyes, contact [CONTACT_2406], photophobia, 
redness (telangiectasia), swelling, discomfort and crusting of the eyelid margins 
(Lindsley et al, 2012). While generally not sight-threatening, blepharitis can induce 

CONFIDENTIAL 
NCX-4251-02 version 4.0; 24-Mar-2021  Page 11 of 74 permanent eyelid margin alterations (eyelid notching and scarring, loss of 
eyelashes, in-turning of eyelashes) and even vision loss from superficial 
keratopathy, corneal neovascularization, or ulceration. Chronic blepharitis can also 
lead to destruction of the meibomian gland architecture and closure of the orifices 
by [CONTACT_601000] (AAO PPP, 2013; Foulks, 2009). Blepharitis affects all ages and 
ethnic groups. While children can develop blepharitis, onset is typi[INVESTIGATOR_793024]. Although blepharitis is commonly encountered in clinical practice, its 
true incidence and prevalence in the general population has not been well 
documented apart from some regional studies. In one survey, ophthalmologists and 
optometrists in the [LOCATION_002] reported that 37% to 47% of their patients had 
evidence of blepharitis (AAO PPP, 2013; Lemp, 2009).  
Even though the treatment of chronic blepharitis remains controversial, palpebral 
neutral shampoo cleaning has been the most widely accepted medical therapy in the 
U.S., followed by [CONTACT_793075], or combination of antibiotic and steroid 
ointments. Short courses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_793025] (Lindsley et al, 2012; AAO PPP, 2013, 
Arrua, 2015; Pflugfelder, 2014; Jackson, 2008). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_243874], 
including 0.5% loteprednol etabonate and 0.1% dexamethasone, in combination 
with topi[INVESTIGATOR_527136], have been effective in reducing the signs of 
blepharitis, with some differences in safety profile with respect to IOP (Pflugfelder 
et al, 2014; Hosseini et al, 2016; Comstock et al, 2017). No clinical trials have 
evaluated topi[INVESTIGATOR_793026]; the site of 
blepharitis. Eyelid margin application may avoid ocular side effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_793027], including IOP elevation. Although fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 
(FP) demonstrates greater activity than other corticosteroids of similar potency in 
vasoconstrictor assays in humans, FP used in the treatment of inhalation, intranasal 
or dermatological disorders demonstrates low potential to cause significant 
suppression of the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis (Spencer and 
Wiseman, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Korting and Schöllmann, 2012). 
FP is a synthetic tri-fluorinated corticosteroid of medium potency (class III) with 
high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, high lipophilicity, rapid hepatic 
biotransformation and a favorable benefit/risk ratio (Johnson, 1998; Korting and 
Schöllmann, 2012).  Like other topi[INVESTIGATOR_793028], FP has anti-
inflammatory, immunosuppressive, antipruritic, and antiproliferative effects, which 
is thought to be its primary mechanism of action in the treatment of several skin 
disorders (Roeder et al, 2005; Cutivate Lotion US Prescribing Information, 2015). 
FP is a locally active glucocorticoid which has no demonstrable systemic side-
effects when given by [CONTACT_793076][INVESTIGATOR_123001], as it appears to be extracted totally 
during its 'first pass' from the gut through the liver. FP has an established 
nonclinical and clinical safety profile as inhalation, nasal, and dermal formulations. 
FP is marketed for the treatment of asthma (Flovent® HFA, NDA 021433, Advair® 
DISKUS®, NDA 021077), rhinitis (Flonase® NDA 020121), and atopic dermatitis 
(Cutivate®, NDA 021152).   
Nicox is developi[INVESTIGATOR_536218] 4251 for the treatment of acute exacerbations of 
blepharitis to address the current unmet medical need.

The study will be considered a success and NCX 4251 will be claimed to be 
superior to placebo in the proportion of subjects with complete cure (score =0) in 
the composite (sum) of Eyelid Margin Redness, Eyelid Debris, and Eyelid 
Discomfort at Day 15 if the primary endpoint is demonstrated to be statistically 
significant in favor of NCX 4251. 
Statistical inference will be made on the two secondary endpoints only if the 
primary endpoint demonstrates statistical significance in favour of NCX 4251.  
Multiplicity correction within the two secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
completed using Hochberg’s procedure.  
 
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard 
deviation, standard error, median, minimum, and maximum. Summaries for 
discrete variables will include frequency counts and percentages. The Baseline 
measure will be defined as the last non-missing measure prior to initiation of study 
treatment.  Baseline value will be the last non-missing measure prior to initiation 
of study treatment.  Analyses will be completed on the study eye and fellow eye 
separately.  Additional analyses may be completed using both eyes within a model 
accounting for the correlation between eyes within a subject and will be detailed in 
the formal statistical analysis plan. 
 
 
 
Efficacy analyses 
Complete cure (score =0) in the composite (sum) of Eyelid Margin Redness, 
Eyelid Debris, and Eyelid Discomfort will be summarized using discrete summary 
statistics (frequency counts and percentages) as well as two-sided 95% Clopper-
Pearson confidence intervals by [CONTACT_1570]. The primary efficacy analyses 
will test the difference in the proportion of study eyes with complete cure in the 
composite score between NCX [ADDRESS_1093477] and baseline composite score as a covariate.  
The, marginal proportions and difference in proportions along with the 
corresponding two-sided 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-value will be 
presented. 
Secondarily, differences (NCX 4251 Ophthalmic Suspension minus placebo) 
between treatment groups will be summarized using difference in proporti ons, 95% 
asymptotic confidence intervals around the differences in proportions, and 
Pearson’s chi-squared test.

Description of the Study Medication 
The study medication is a sterile, isotonic, buffered ophthalmic aqueous suspension containing 
NCX 4251 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_793035]) 0.1%. For further detail see Section 6.1.

NCX-4251-02 version 4.0; 24-Mar-2021  Page 22 of 74 Description of the Placebo Comparator 
The placebo comparator is the vehicle of NCX 4251 Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.1%. For further 
detail see Section 6.1. 
Justification of the Study Design  
The proposed study is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, 
Phase 2b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of NCX 4251 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_793036]) Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.1% QD for the treatment of acute exacerbations of 
blepharitis.  
The study design is the same as that used during the QD-dosing cohort of NCX-4251-01. 
Justification of the Route of Delivery 
A reduction in the unwanted, systemic effects of glucocorticoids can be achieved by [CONTACT_793083]. Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_28321] a potent, locally active 
glucocorticoid which has been administered safely as an intranasal spray, inhaled suspension 
and skin formulations for decades. It is therefore most appropriate to use topi[INVESTIGATOR_793037]. A dosing paradigm has 
been developed by [CONTACT_793084] 4251 with an applicator directly at the site of 
the signs and symptoms of blepharitis, namely on the upper and lower eyelids as well as on the 
lower eyelid margin.  
Justification of the Dose Selection for NCX 4251 Ophthalmic Suspension 
Traditionally blepharitis has been treated by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_793038] 
0.1% or loteprednol etabonate 0.5%. However, this route of administration results in a minimal 
dose being delivered to the site of the disease origin, the margin of the eyelid. With NCX 4251, 
the drug will be delivered directly to the site of the disorder. The starting dose was selected 
based on the combination of NCX [ADDRESS_1093481] 6 months and who are currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of blepharitis in 
both eyes will be randomized in this clinical study conducted in the U.S.

1.3.1 Results of NCX-4251-01 
To date, the safety and efficacy of NCX 4251 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) Ophthalmic Suspension 
has been evaluated in one dose-escalation Phase 2 trial (NCX-4251-01) in which 10 subjects 
received NCX 4251 0.1% QD, 5 subjects received placebo QD, 10 subjects received 
NCX 4251 0.1% BID, and 11 subjects received placebo BID. The results of NCX-4251-01 
indicated that efficacy in reducing the signs and symptoms of blepharitis (i.e., lid debris, eyelid 
redness, eyelid discomfort) and in temporarily relieving the signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease were not enhanced with BID application of NCX 4251 relative to QD application; 
however, the proportion of subjects experiencing ocular adverse events was increased with 
BID application. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.3.1 Risks Associated with Other Ophthalmic or Topi[INVESTIGATOR_793039], adverse reactions with NCX 4251 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) 
Ophthalmic Suspension may include elevated IOP, which may be associated with optic nerve 
damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary 
ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where 
there is thinning of the cornea or sclera ( McGhee et al, 2002 ). 
These same risks pertain to NCX 4251 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) Ophthalmic Suspension which 
will be applied to the eyelid margins. Specifically, raised IOP and glaucoma have been 
associated with use of periorbital corticosteroids for dermatological conditions such as 
blepharitis and eczema ( Garrot and Walland, 2004 ; Cubey 1976). 
Local adverse reactions which have been reported infrequently with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (dermal) 
corticosteroids, and which may occur more frequently with higher potency corticosteroids 
include irritation, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], perioral dermatitis, 
allergic contact [CONTACT_8748], secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria ( Fluticasone 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_793040] 0.05% US Prescribing Information, 2016 ). The penetration of 0.005% 
fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_793041] a single application in vitro has been 
shown to be very small ( Tan, 2001).  
Additionally, systemic absorption of topi[INVESTIGATOR_793042]. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be 
produced in some patients by [CONTACT_793085][INVESTIGATOR_793043]. 
However, in patients as young as 3 months, fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0.05% lotion was shown to

extensively over widespread, severe inflammatory disease ( Herbert, 2006).  
Specific risks associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_793044]-dose 
containers of topi[INVESTIGATOR_689622]. These containers had been inadvertently 
contaminated by [CONTACT_793086].  
Benefits 
Glucocorticoids produce a number of beneficial effects on the events involved in inflammation. 
These include inhibition of production of interleukins, inhibition of cellular and protein 
extravasation, inhibition of arachidonic acid generation from phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_1842] a reduction in 
the release of proteases and other enzymes from a number of cell types. The effects are 
cumulative, such that clinical improvement continues over several days or weeks of treatment 
(Harding, 1990). The expected benefits of the application of NCX 4251 Ophthalmic 
Suspension in subjects with blepharitis are the relief of the signs and symptoms of blepharitis 
such as eyelid redness, ocular discomfort, itchy eyes, swollen eyes, crusted eyelashes upon 
awakening, watery eyes, gritty, burning or stinging sensation in the eyes.

3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b study.  
Subjects will be assessed for initial eligibility at the Screening Visit (Day -14 to -7).  Eligible 
adult subjects with a documented history of blepharitis and who are experiencing an acute 
exacerbation of blepharitis defined as a minimum score of ‘1’ (on a 4-point scale) for each of 
Eyelid Margin Redness, Eyelid Debris, and overall Eyelid Discomfort at both the 
Screening and Baseline/Day 1 Visits may be randomized into the study. 
A total of approximately 300 subjects will be screened such that 200 eligible subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive NCX 4251 Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.1% or placebo for 
both eyelids, QD. 
 
  
Study medication will be applied via a sterile applicator to the upper and lower eyelids and 
lower eyelid margin of both eyes once daily in the morning for 14 days. Subjects will also 
perform daily scrubs of the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes using diluted baby [CONTACT_793087] a cotton swab prior to the application of the study medication. 
Study visits will be as follows: Screening (Day -14 to -7), Baseline/Day 1, Day 4 (± 1 day), 
Day 8 (± 1 day), Day 11 (± 1 day), Day 15 (- 1 day), and Day 29/Exit (± 2 days; follow up 
visit). 
Following the Screening Visit and prior to Baseline/Day 1 Visit, subjects will continue their 
previous routine for cleaning of eyelids that they were using prior to the Screening Visit. Both 
eyes will be treated from the Baseline/Day 1 Visit through the day prior to the Day 15 Visit. 
 
 
. From the Day 15 Visit through the day prior to the 
Day 29/Exit Visit, subjects will continue performing the eyelid scrubs.  
Study medication will be self-administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_793045]. Morning eyelid scrubs 
and morning study medication application will be performed by [CONTACT_793088]. 
A subject will be considered as having completed the study after completion of Day 29/Exit 
Visit (± 2 days). The duration of subject participation (from the Screening Visit to the Exit 
Visit) is approximately [ADDRESS_1093484].

(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. Lack of efficacy will be reported as a treatment failure, not as an AE. 
10.2 Severity of Adverse Event 
The severity of an AE should be categorized as mild, moderate or severe per Investigator’s 
judgment with the following scale in consideration:  Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s usual 
activities or is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae. 
 Moderate : interferes with the subject’s usual activities, and or requires symptomatic 
treatment. 
 Severe: symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of the subject’s 
usual activities and requires treatment.

[CONTACT_536265]. The following terms to evaluate the causality of the AE with the 
study drug should be used: 
 Unrelated:  a simultaneous disease, a simultaneous treatment or any other known cause 
is clearly responsible for the safety event and the AE is not related to the study 
medication.  Unlikely:  on the basis of the available knowledge regarding the subject’s history, the 
disease process, the timing of the safety event in relation to the application of the study 
medication and the mode of action of study medication, a relation between the study 
medication and the safety event is unlikely, but cannot be totally excluded.   Possible:  this relation exists when the safety event follows the reasonable chronological 
sequence from the moment of the study medication application, but when the safety 
event could also have been caused by [CONTACT_793097].  
 Probable:  this relation exists when the safety event follows a reasonable chronological 
sequence from the moment of the study medication application, corresponds to a known 
effect of the study medication, is confirmed by [CONTACT_793098], and therefore the study medication 
is the most probable of all the causes.

 Results in death, or 
 Results in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect ( Section 12.2 - Procedure in Case of 
Pregnancy), or 
 Results in life-threatening illness or injury (Note: The term “life-threatening” in the 
definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it was more severe, or had continued untreated).  Results in a significant and persistent loss or impairment of vision.  
Additionally, medical events that may not meet these criteria, may be considered an SAE if, 
based on the medical judgment of the Investigator, such medical events may require an 
intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.  
To ensure no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms "serious" and 
"severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided: the term 
"severe" is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event.  This is not the same as 
"serious," which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning.

however, other events may occur during this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793050]-serious adverse events and will need to be captured according to the protocol. 
10.5 Adverse Event Reporting 
In this study, subjects should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously or in response to 
general, non-directed questioning (e.g., “How has your health been since the last visit?”).  If it 
is determined that an AE has occurred, the Investigator should obtain all the information 
required to complete the AE Form(s).  
Additionally, subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737], and/or study coordinator if 
any significant AEs occur between study visits.

10.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Any SAE occurring from the signing of the ICF on the day of the Screening Visit until Day 29/ 
Exit must immediately be reported  representing Nicox, and recorded on the 
appropriate forms.  All subjects with an SAE must be followed up until complete healing or 
stabilization, or up to 30 days after the end of Treatment Period (Day 15), whichever occurs 
first, and the SAE outcome reported. 
The Investigator must supply the company representing Nicox with any additional requested 
information (e.g., autopsy reports and final medical reports). 
In the event of an SAE, the Investigator must: 
1) Notify the Primary Contact [CONTACT_793100] (see 
contact [CONTACT_536270] 2 and Section 12.1), at the latest within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the initial SAE.  Complete an SAE Form (see instructions for 
completion of SAE Form in Appendix 3 ) and send it to the Primary Contact [CONTACT_536271]. Retain all submission confirmations with the items 
submitted.  
2) Obtain and maintain in subject’s files pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject.  
3) Complete and submit further follow-up reports for data collected until the SAE has 
resolved or a decision for no further follow up has been taken.  
4) Promptly inform the local IRB and/or other applicable regulatory body as required by 
[CONTACT_427].

An analysis plan containing detailed statistical methods, including accounting for missing data, 
will be generated and finalized prior to database lock.   
11.1 Determination of Sample Size and Power Calculations 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the proportion of subjects with 
complete cure (score =0) in the composite (sum) of Eyelid Margin Redness, Eyelid Debris, and 
Eyelid Discomfort at Day 15 for NCX 4251 treated subjects is statistically superior to placebo 
treated subjects using a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. 
For the complete cure endpoint,  approximately 208 
subjects randomized overall (~104 subjects randomized per treatment group, with 94 subjects 
per treatment group completing the Day 15 study time point evaluations)  to 
demonstrate statistical superiority to placebo. 
The above analysis assumed a Day 15 time point;  
; and a 
two-sided significance level of 5% using a Fisher’s exact test. 
The secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate that mean reduction from baseline in 
Eye Dryness evaluated on VAS and/or Fluorescein Staining of inferior cornea at Day 15 for 
NCX 4251 are statistically superior to placebo using a Hochberg procedure to maintain the 
overall Type I Error rate = 0.05. 
For Eye Dryness endpoint,  approximately 124 
subjects randomized overall (~62 subjects per treatment group, with 55 subjects per group 
completing Day 15)  to demonstrate statistical superiority to placebo. 
The above analysis assumed a Day 15 time point;  
 and a two-sided significance level 
of 0.[ADDRESS_1093513]. 
For Fluorescein Staining of inferior cornea, , 
approximately 72 subjects randomized overall (~36 subjects per treatment group, with 32 
subjects per group completing Day 15)  to demonstrate statistical superiority 
to placebo. 
The above analysis assumed a Day 15 time point;  
 and a two-sided significance 
level of 0.[ADDRESS_1093514]. 
The study will be considered a success and NCX 4251 will be claimed to be superior to 
placebo in the proportion of subjects with complete cure (score =0) in the composite (sum) of 
Eyelid Margin Redness, Eyelid Debris, and Eyelid Discomfort at Day 15 if the primary 
endpoint is demonstrated to be statistically significant in favor of NCX 4251. 
Statistical inference will be made on the two secondary endpoints only if the primary endpoint 
demonstrates statistical significance in favor of NCX 4251.  Multiplicity correction within the 
two secondary efficacy endpoints will be completed using Hochberg’s procedure.

1. As soon as possible, and at the latest within [ADDRESS_1093534] on the case report form a diagnosis (when 
possible and appropriate) rather than each individual sign and symptom. 
3. Terms such as death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a procedural name [CONTACT_793107].  Example: Subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277026].  The event 
term would be “Cholecystitis” (not the procedure).  Example: “Death” is an outcome not an event term.  The Investigator should report the 
primary cause of death as the SAE term. 
4. All initial SAE reports must have the relationship to study medication documented. 
5. All SAEs will be:  
 Followed to resolution (subject’s health has returned to their baseline status or all 
variables have returned to normal) or  
 Followed until stabilization of the event has occurred (the Investigator does not expect 
any further improvement or worsening of the event) or  
 The event is followed up to [ADDRESS_1093535] study medication application. 
 Some events do not end, such as metastasis; however, once these events are determined

 Specify the cause of death (do not use the term “death” and avoid using cardiac arrest 
or respi[INVESTIGATOR_793067]. Instead, provide the diagnosis leading to cardiac arrest 
or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].)   There should be only one SAE with an outcome of death for each subject. 
 For other adverse events that were ongoing at the time of death, enter outcome of these 
events as ‘Ongoing.’ 
 Please submit a copy of the Death Certificate and Autopsy Report (if applicable). 
7. Review all source documents (examples - hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533]) as 
additional SAEs may be detected.  If there are any questions as to whether you think an 
additional SAE may be present, please contact [CONTACT_216643]. 
8. Protect the subject’s identity.  Redact all individually identifiable information (e.g., 
subject’s name, medical record number, social security number and any parent or spouse 
APPENDIX 4 CONFIDENTIAL 
NCX-4251-02 version 4.0; 24-Mar-2021  Page 74 of 74 information such as names and addresses) in the header as well as in the body of the text on 
any supporting documents. 
9. Follow-up SAE form completion instructions: 
 Complete and submit further Follow-up Reports for data collected until the SAE has 
resolved or a decision for no further follow up has been taken.  Complete a new SAE Form.  At the top of the first page, tick the follow-up report or 
final report box and fax all pages even if changes were only made to one of the pages  
 Retain the submission confirmation. 
10. In case of mistake on the original initial SAE Form submitted to the SAE contact [CONTACT_9702], 
correct it, date and sign it and submit it again.  Retain the submission confirmation. 
11. Downgrading/deletion of a previously reported SAE: 
If the Investigator determines a previously reported SAE doesn’t meet serious criteria, a 
Follow-up SAE report should be completed.  Document in the “Event Summary” section a 
brief explanation of why the Investigator determined the event to not be serious ( i.e., “it 
was determined that the subject was not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; therefore, this event does not meet 
serious criteria” or “the event was determined to be past medical history”) 
12. File original forms in the Case Report Form (CRF) of the subject. 
13. Inform the IRB per IRB requirements and as required by [CONTACT_427].

 THE FEASIBILITY OF USING THE ULTRAVISION ™ SYSTEM  TO FACILITATE LOW IMPACT LAPAROSCOPIC 
SURGERY FOR THE TREATMENT OF ENDOMETRIOSIS  
 
Study Summary  
Introduction and Background  
The Ultravision™ System is a n FDA -cleared  medical device that removes surgical smoke by [CONTACT_676743][INVESTIGATOR_217688]. “Surgical smoke” 
refers to the suspended particulate matter that is gene rated as a by -product of the combustion and other 
processes that are associated with the use of energy -based surgical instruments. Surgical smoke can obscure 
(partially or totally) the surgeon’s view of the operative field and this has obvious safety impli cations for the 
patient. In the case of laparoscopic procedures, which are increasing in popularity, the smoke is retained 
within the “closed abdomen” and this, coupled with the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum, presents additional 
challenges for the surgical team .  The Ultravision™ System can therefore be considered an accessory to 
electrosurgical instruments to clear the surgical smoke generated during their use and as such will only be 
used when such devices are in use.   
The ability to operate under “low impact ” laparoscopic conditions has been shown by [CONTACT_676744], for example, reducing post -surgical pain and  with smaller incision sizes,  improved 
cosmesis.  For the purposes of this study “low impact” is defined as (1) a target pneumoperit oneal pressure of 
10mm Hg; and (2) instead of 10mm and/or 12mm ports, the use of 3mm ports  and one 5mm port.  Using a 
standard insufflator, the combination of lower pneumoperitoneal pressure and smaller size ports creates 
visualization challenges for the s urgeon due to the difficulty of preventing the buildup of surgical smoke 
within the abdomen.  “Venting” or actively extracting the smoke through a trocar is known to be largely 
ineffective due to the narrow internal diameter of 3mm trocars, certainly unles s the instrument is removed 
beforehand, which creates additional surgical challenges. Furthermore, operating under lower pressure can 
cause pneumoperitoneum to be lost upon venting of the smoke.  The research question that is posed in this 
study is whether  the Ultravison™ System , due to its unique mode of action which (unlike other smoke 
management approaches) provides smoke management without needing to extract or exchange CO 2,  provides 
effective visual field clearing , thereby [CONTACT_676745] a conventional 
insufflator.  In addition, Ultravision™  does not require CO [ADDRESS_915122] extent possible patient CO 2 exposure .  CO 2 is dry (effectively 0 % 
relative humidity) and cold (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 65F) and exposure is linked to postoperative pain and other adverse 
consequences such as patient cooling  and tissue desiccation.  Due its mode of action, Ultravision™  
minimizes CO 2 exposure to the patient.

 Laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of endometriosis is a common procedure for the removal of mild to 
moderate endometriosis.  Diathermy is commonly used to remove the lesions which can be extensive, 
therefore this procedure presents an appropriate surg ical procedure for this study.  
Assessments in terms of surgical field visualization,  CO 2 consumption, end tidal CO 2, patient satisfaction for 
cosmesis,  and postoperative pain will be conducted in order to determine if the Ultravision™ System is 
effective  in enabling laparoscopic surgery under low impact laparoscopic conditions.   Adverse event 
information will be reported.  The study is a n open label  single arm study.  
Study Purpose  
There are f ive main study objectives:  
1. Demonstrate the feasibility of undertaking low impact laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis when 
using the Ultravision™ System.  
2. Assess the impact of Ultravision on visual field clarity.   
3. Determine the ability to complete the procedure while maintaining an abdominal pres sure of < 
10mmHg.  
4. Quantify the consumption of CO 2. 
5. Collect data on additional clinical outcomes associated with the use of Ultravision and low impact 
surgery  (i.e. end tidal CO 2 levels (EtCO 2), adverse events, cosmesis outcome, postoperative pain 
levels an d pain medications ). 
Study Hypothesi s 
The primary hypothesis being tested in this study  is that Ultravision facilitates the utilization of low impact 
laparoscopic surgery techniques whilst maintaining an adequate visual field throughout the procedure with 
low demand for  CO [ADDRESS_915123] meet 
all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Study Design  
This i s a prospective single arm study.  The study will enroll 20 patients. Comparisons to prior clinical trials 
and published literature will be made to assess the relative significance of the study results.

 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_915125] ION & BACKGROUND   
The advantages of laparoscopic surgery are generally accepted in the medical community.  However, as with 
any therapy or procedure the unique circumstances  associated with this type of surgery  are not without 
physiological consequences such as tissue desiccation and postoperative pain . 1 2  The working space created 
by [CONTACT_676747] 2 is required to create the visual/working field but creates its own concerns 
regarding abdominal pr essure and CO 2 absorption into the abdominal tissue.3  The smoke generated by 
[CONTACT_676748] . It is often nece ssary to  suspend the surgery to allow the 
smoke to dissipate,  or more commonly open a laparoscopic port to vent the smoke into the room, adding to 
the operating time. It is also common to remove the laparoscope  to clean the lens because it can be soiled by  
[CONTACT_676749] . In order  to enhance the dissipation of smoke  and maintain an adequate pneumoperitoneum  
it is often necessary to increase the flow of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the insufflator.  Surgical smoke 
handling during laparoscopic surgery results in an increase  of the known risks to the patient of using 
excessive CO 2 as well as exposing the operating room staff  to the smoke  which may create a potential health 
concern .   
The Ultravision™ Visual Field Clearing System provides a stable and clear visualization using electrostatic  
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_676731].  This is accomplished with Ultravision   without 
requiring venting of gas, that would other wise be replaced to maintain the pneumoperitoneum operating 
pressure.  Because it does not rely on gas flow for smoke clearing , CO [ADDRESS_915126] been carried out allowing it t o be placed on the 
market  in Europe, Japan and the [LOCATION_002] . A randomized  study  of its clinical effectiveness showed that

myomectomy reported similar results at lower pneumoperitoneal pressures (10mmHg). [ADDRESS_915128] -surgical pain and improved cosmesis. 6  For the purposes of this 
study “low impact” is defined as (1) a target pneumoperitoneal pressure of 10mm Hg; and (2) the use of 3mm 
ports with one 5mm port.  Usin g a standard insufflator, the combination of lower pneumoperitoneal pressure 
and smaller size ports creates visualization challenges for the surgeon due to the difficulty of preventing the 
buildup of surgical smoke within the abdomen.  “Venting” or activel y extracting the smoke through a trocar is 
known to be largely ineffective due to the narrow internal diameter of 3mm trocars, certainly unless the 
instrument is removed beforehand, which creates additional surgical challenges.  In addition, due to its uni que 
mode of action, Ultravision™, unlike other smoke clearing systems, does not require CO 2 removal and 
replacement to achieve its intended use.  CO 2 exposure is linked to postoperative pain and other adverse 
consequences (i.e. patient cooling, tissue desi ccation).  Due its mode of action, Ultravision™  minimizes CO [ADDRESS_915129] of maintaining visua l field clarity during laparoscopic surgery: a

 Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_915133]  IDENTIFICATION & SELECTION  
Potential subjects will be identified from the clinical practice of the participating investigator or by [CONTACT_217701].  Patients presenting to the clinical practice of the participati ng investigator for 
diagnosis or treatment consistent with the inclusion criteria will be informed about the study.   
With referral from the treating physician/provider, patients scheduled for surgery prior to the start of the study 
may be contact[CONTACT_676751] a study team member to inform them of the study, assess their interest and 
assess their eligibility to participate.  An IRB approved script will be used for such calls.  For interested 
patients, a copy of the informed consent can be mailed or em ailed to the patient for their review and 
consideration prior to their next clinic visit or the scheduled procedure.   
Each new subject  presenting for evaluation or inclusion  is to be assessed for adherence to the following 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. De termination of whether subject s satisfy the criteria may be established by 
[CONTACT_217703], subject  interview, physical examination, or testing as appropriate. A baseline form 
is used to collect subject  screening information and baseline assessme nts.  Patients are considered enrolled 
once it has been demonstrated that the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met and the patient signs the 
informed consent.    
The study allows for an intraoperative exclusion for excessive abdominal wall thickness  or other anatomical 
characteristics that prevent the use of Ultravision .  If this should occur, the patient will be withdrawn from the 
study.  The withdrawal will be recorded on the withdrawal case report form.  The patient will be replaced.  
11.1. INCLUSION CRI TERIA  
Subjects MUST meet all the following:  
I1 Is [ADDRESS_915134] any of the following:  
 
  
 Confidential  Page 13 of 27 
 E1 Existing comorbidities that would contraindicate them for laparoscopic surgery . 
E2 Patient anatomy  that is not compatible with the use of the Ionwand catheter  i.e. 
abdominal wall thickness that exceeds the working length of the Ionwand catheter  
identified intraope ratively    
E3 Patient with a BMI > [ADDRESS_915135] access 
to this information.  Safeguards to maintain privacy and confidentiality of information will be taken as 
described in the data collection and management section of the protocol. Patient inc lusion could be 
substantially hindered without the ability to review patients’ records for eligibility and recruitment purposes, 
particularly for patients who may have already been scheduled for surgery at the time the study begins.   
Referred patients pre senting for diagnosis or treatment consistent with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will 
undergo the informed consent process to authorize the gathering of data recorded on the Subject Screening & 
Enrollment Form.  The study investigator will administer in formed consent or may delegate the responsibility 
to a qualified individual as long as it is defined on the study responsibility log.  When administering consent, 
it must be evident that the participant comprehends the nature of the study and the risks and  benefits.  
Evidence is the patient is able to verbalize these topi[INVESTIGATOR_676732].  
Completion of the informed consent does not constitute enrollment.  Enrollment occurs once screening is 
complete and all criteria for parti cipation have been met.  
Subjects must document their consent for study  participation by [CONTACT_2960] t he Institutional Review Board 
approved Informed Consent Form.  The informed consent process must be consistent with the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  The subject m ust be given the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, study  
personnel prior to a request to sign the  Informed  Consent Form.  This form is to be co -signed by [CONTACT_1275].  Failure to obtain consent prior to subject participation i s considered a protocol deviation and 
must be reported to the Institutional Review Board .

chooses to withdraw , they will still receive medical care consistent with the standard of care.   The investigator 
may at their discretion withdraw a patient from participation  or where intraoperative exclusions (defined in 
the I/E criteria) occur. Other examples  include  if the procedure necessitates conversion from laparoscopic to 
open  technique , lack of adherence to visit schedule, adverse events, or safety concerns.  For all withdrawals 
the date, point in the study, and reason for withdrawal will be  recorded.   Patients that w ithdraw prior to the 
procedure or are withdrawn from the study due to an intraoperative exclusion are replaced.

24. IMAGING DIAGNOSTICS  
Any imaging performed for patients is considered consistent with standard  of care . 
25. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN   
25.1.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
Ultravision is already cleared by [CONTACT_676753].  This  post -market study 
is intended to evaluate user satisfaction and the relative impact the Ultravision™ System has on the 
procedure as opposed to demonstrating safety and efficacy.  The sample size selected (20) is  considered 
to be a sufficient quantity to establish whether or not low impact surgery is facilitated with the use of the 
 
  
 Confidential  Page 21 of 27 
 Ultravision™ System.  This is designed as a single arm study to demonstrate feasibility of device use 
under low impact laparoscopy.  The Ultravision will either enable the procedure to be completed as 
planned or not, therefore a control arm is not considered necessary to make this determination. In 
addition, incorporating a control arm using the  same conditions without the use of Ultravision may not be 
in the best interest of the patient. The study design is considered to appropriate for the research question 
that is being posed.  
25.2. DATA ANALYSIS  
Data collected will be summarized using descriptive s tatistics.    Results from other studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_676754] .  Additional exploratory analysis may be conducted during data ana lysis.

investigation.  The investigator shall be required to complete a summary report to Alesi Surgical, Ltd 
capturing their general observations.  
30.3. RECORD RETENTION  
Subject  records, correspondence files, all supporting documentation, and reports must remain on file at 
the investigational site for a minimum of three years or in line with the Mercy ’s document retention 
policy (if longer) after the completion/termination of this or when it is no longer needed to support a 
marketing application, whichever is later.  
31. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
Medical treatment provided to the patient is within the standard of care for this type of procedure.  Additional 
assessments for procedure data, end tidal CO [ADDRESS_915147] procedure pain assessments, pain medication, 
cosmesis result, and adverse event information do not introduce new risks to the patient.  If necessary , the 
investigator will increase the pressure required to achieve adequate visualization/working space . 
As surgical accessory device s, the Ultravision does not administer any medical treatment.  The risks 
associated with  its use are consistent wit h other  surgical accessories used in laparoscopic surgery.  The 
Ultravision™ System is required to undergo testing for  sterility, biocompatibility, and electrical safety in 
order to demonstrate  that such risks have been mitigated to acceptable levels.  The benefits that are being 
evaluated in this study  are quality of visualization  under low impact laparoscopic conditions  with the 
anticipated improvement in patient  outcomes in terms of cosmesis and  postoperative  pain.

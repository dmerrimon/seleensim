Title: Removing Home Hazards for Older Adults  
 
Investigators:  Susan Stark, PhD, OTR/L &  Yan Yan, MD, PhD   
Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis, Missouri  
 
Falls remain the leading cause of injury, long -term disability, premature institutionalization, and 
injury -related mortality among older adults and are projected to cost nearly $59.[ADDRESS_683567] demonstrated efficacy in reducing the incidence of falls,73 translation to the community has 
failed; fall rates continue t o escalate. Indeed, nearly one third of all adults older than [ADDRESS_683568]. Louis, 
Missouri, an area of high need  for an effective fall prevention program. In Missouri, the fall 
death rate for older adults is consistently higher than the national average. The rate nearly 
doubled between 2000 and 2009 from 38 to 72.32 per 100,000.75  Falls are the leading cause of 
unintentional injury -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526800] ; older adults 
account for 64%  of all ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_526801], which is higher than 
national rates . 76, 77 
 
Our long -term goal  is to improve older adults’ ability  to maintain their independence and safety 
in the community by [CONTACT_526812].  We 
plan to establish  the effectiveness  of a program that demonstrated a reduction in falls among 
community -dwelling olde r adults at high risk for a fall. It is a practical and scalable intervention 
recommended by [CONTACT_7698](CDC).1 The intervention will  
be delivered by [CONTACT_526813] (AAA) —part of the Aging Services Network53 
in the US. We will use community -engaged research approaches54 and a hybrid design55 to study 
both the effect of the intervention in a real world setting and the implementation strategy. We 
will prepare for dissemination56 by [CONTACT_526814], fidelity metrics, and intervention 
manuals.  
 
Design of study:  
To examine the effect of a home modification (home hazar d removal) program, we will conduct 
a hybrid effectiveness/implementation trial of [ADDRESS_683569] a 
pragmatic randomized controll ed trial/implementation study  
 
Recruitment: We will recruit participants through the SLAAA ’s annual assessment of 
participant’s health.  .   
 
Deliver intervention: Interventionists will use a manualized protocol to deliver the intervention.   
 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 iv Follow up: We will follow participants monthly using a highly successful calendar journal 
technique that has demonstrated a 99% response rate in previous studies.   
 
Dissemination: We will disseminate the program, manuals and training programs using our 
advisory network.   
 
Objectives of study:  
1. Determine the acceptability costs and feasibility of delivering the program in an Area 
Agency on Aging. We will conduct a process evaluation78 of the intervention to aid in 
dissemination and interpretability of the trial by [CONTACT_526815], feasibility, safety, 
and cost. We will test the hypothesis  that home modification interventions will have high 
acceptability (80% retention), high fidelity by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_11437] (95% of elements; 90% of dose 
delivered), low safety risk (no inc reased rate of falls compared to usual care group), and high 
adherence (80% of modifications in use) at 12 months. 
 
2. Determine if the program is e ffective in reducing the rate and risk of falls and improving 
the outcome of other participant -reported outc omes (PROs) that can be effected by [CONTACT_283800]. We will test the hypothesis  that older adults who receive the program will have 
a lower rate and risk of falls, improved self -efficacy, daily activity performance, and quality 
of life compared with the usual care group.  
      
Expected outcomes : The central hypothesis of this study  is that home modifications (home 
hazard removal) will be acceptable to older adults, practical for delivery in an existing social 
service network, and efficacious in reducing f alls and maintaining independence for older adults. 
Our research team has a unique skill set to address this problem, including: a long relationship 
with an AAA, experience studying home modifications in the community, experience conducting 
pragmatic trials, and expertise in dissemination and implementation science. If successful, this 
study could have immediate positive impact by [CONTACT_526816] a 
program with high adherence, structured to deploy within an existing aging services network that 
could significantly reduce falls among community -dwelling older adults at high risk.

 10 5 SELECTION AND ENROLL MENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
5.1 Inclusion /Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteria :  1) aged 65 years or older ; 2) self -report of one previous fall or more in the 
preceding 12 months or self -report as “worried about falling;” and currently receiving services 
from SLAAA.                                                                                                 
Exclusion criteria : 1) residents of nursing homes ; 2) individuals with severe cognitive 
impairment who are unable to give consent to participate (as determined by a score of greater 
than 10 on the SBT for memory10) 
5.2 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Study population , eligibility, and screening . The National Aging Program Information System 
(NAPIS) is a database of information collected annually by [CONTACT_526819], nutritional, financial, functional, and environmental status of an 
older adult. Missouri’s assessment (MA4) currently includes an evidence -based fall -risk 
screening as part of an extensive battery of standardized assessments. In the current cohort of 
1,331 older adults screened in CY 2013 by [CONTACT_526820], the average age of the cohort is 77 years, 67 
percent are female and 74% are African American. More than 25% reported a fall in the past 12 
months, and 40% are “worried about falling.” The average score on ADL performance was 4 
(range, 1 –7); indicating moderate ADL impairment). We will recruit fro m this cohort of older 
adults who are “at high risk for a fall.”[ADDRESS_683583] baseline assessments, and randomize participants to 
receive th e adapted program or usual care. Outcomes (falls, fall self -efficacy) will be assessed by 
a blinded evaluator at baseline and 12 months after intervention. Flow through the study is 
illustrated in Figure 5. All assessments and study visits will occur in pa rticipants’ homes.  
 
Recruitment. We will randomly select a sample of older adults from the large observational 
cohort of older adults assessed annually by [CONTACT_526821]80 and 
invite them to participate by  [CONTACT_756].  Refusals will be tracked for attribution of ca use.  
 
Consent and enrollment.  Consent will be obtained at the baseline home assessment visit. 
Potential participants will be provided with a study brochure and a copy of the large -print 
consent for m. Scripted details of the project including the randomization procedure, study 
interventions, and follow -up procedures will be discussed (under Section C.2.c ).  
 
Randomization sequence generation, allocation concealment, and implementation . 
Participants will be allocated using a 1:[ADDRESS_683584] to race (self -reported African American 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 11 or “other”) and sex. Randomization sequence concealment will be achieved by [CONTACT_526822] (REDCap) system.81 After baseline assessment, the study coordinator 
will verify that all eligibility requirements are satisfied and then elicit treatment assignment.  
6 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
6.1 Study Interventions  
 
Control group (usual care) . During the treatment phase of the study, each participant 
randomized to control will receive usual care from SLAAA, which includes annual NAPIS 
evaluation (in home) and individualized referrals to services based on identified need. Referrals 
are generated by  [CONTACT_526823] (or their family members) call and request a referral for services.  
 
Procedures for intervention (treatment) . Participants who are randomized to treatment will 
receive usual c are plus the home -modification (home -hazard removal) intervention. The 
intervention, based on a competence/press theoretical framework,[ADDRESS_683585]. Home modifications79 include a 2 -hour home assessment 
conducted by [CONTACT_526824]’s home using the WeHSA . A comprehensive clinical 
assessment will be performed on each participant to determine functional limitations that may 
interact wi th hazards in the home and result in a fall. Environmental hazards and unsafe 
behaviors will be identified. A barrier -removal plan will be provided to the older adult. The OT 
will facilitate home modifications through housing services programs and provided follow -up 2 
weeks after the initial home visit to ensure that the participant adopted the recommended 
modifications .  It is anticipated that 2 -3 visits of 90 minutes each will be provided.  At about 6 
months participants will receive a booster session (in  home visit by [CONTACT_479789]) to reevaluate 
performance in the home and modify the intervention plan as needed.  
 
Interventionist Training  
Each interventionist will receive a [ADDRESS_683586], and quality of the 
intervention.100 We will monitor recruitment metrics for all eligible participants, including 
demographic characteristics, enrollment status, and reason for  decline. We will determine the 
fidelity of the intervention by [CONTACT_526825], Version 1.0  
 12 calculating the dose of the intervention received by [CONTACT_117672] (number of minutes and number 
of sessions delivered). OTs wil l rate adherence at the final visit as the number of 
recommendations implemented per recommendations suggested.6 Long -term adherence will be 
calculated as the number of recommendations used at 12 months per recommendations 
suggested. We wi ll examine reasons for abandonment of strategies to inform the final program. 
We will explore the safety of the intervention by [CONTACT_526826] 
(calculated with an algorithm).101 Environmental modifications are provided through a 
patchwork of services in the US; therefore, reliable cost data are not available. We will track the 
cost of service provision (in the treatment group). We will record OT time to provide services 
(direct and indirect)102 and costs of equipment is sued to participants. Costs of contracting 
services will include installation (labor and materials) and maintenance or repair during follow -
up. All OT time will be recorded using current  procedural terminology codes. The hourly wage of the 
contractor will be estimated using wage rates for the St. Louis area as reported by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics.[ADDRESS_683587] of all materials will be captured from invoices. Costs will be estimated from 
the payor perspective (e.g., Medicare allowable costs will be used to estimate covered clinical 
encounters).104

7.3 Description of Evaluations  
7.3.1  Screening Evaluations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Short Blessed Test (SBT). The SBT[6 1] will be used to screen for severe cognitive impairment. 
The SBT has good validity for older adults[61] and correlates well with the Mini -Mental State 
Exam[62]. This brief, six- item questionnaire assesses cognition, memory, and orientation. 
Incorrect items are scored as the product of the number of errors made and a weighting factor; 
the sum of incorrect item scores comprises the total score. Total scores range from 0 -28; scores 
of 10 or more are consistent with dementia and other cognitive difficulties. Individuals who 
receive a SBT score 10 or more will not be allowed to participate in the proposed study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any self -report of fear of falling in past year.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Falls in past year .  Any report of falls in the previous year will be an automatic inclusion.  
7.3.2 Enrollment, baseline, randomization  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Enrollment  
Informed Consent Process . All elements of consent will be reviewed with older adults prior to 
enrolling in the study, including the purpose of the study, risks, benefits, alternatives to the study, 
how confidentiality will be maintained, the PI’s contact [CONTACT_3031], no consequence s to 
withdrawal, and how study results will be shared. All study staff have undergone IRB training. In 
addition, all staff members have participated in cultural competence training and are trained to 
interview older adults. All staff members are trained to  obtain assent, which is particularly 
important for older adults with low vision, low literacy levels, or limited English proficiency. All 
study documents are available in multiple formats, are developed in 16- point Arial font, and are 
written in plain lan guage. All informed consent documents are reviewed by [CONTACT_526827] (involved in the design of the study) to ensure clarity for older 
adults.  
Steps to understand the elements of informed consent . Wri tten informed consent to participate in 
the study will be obtained before any test or measurement is performed. Eligibility will be 
confirmed prior to enrollment. All potential participants will be screened using a script by [CONTACT_408308]. Screening will take place in person or  over the phone. Potential participants will be 
given a copy of the large -print informed consent  document and a study review sheet  written at 
the appropriate reading level  to review. During screening, all participants (1) will have a 
detailed, plain -langua ge explanation of the study and what is expected of them; (2) will discuss 
potential problems that could interfere with participation; (3) will have their questions answered; 
and (4) will receive a plain -language summary of the study and contact [CONTACT_35666] n for the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_32528]. Consent will occur during the first home assessment visit. The consent 
form will be signed by a witness and stored in the office of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_526802]. 
Participants will be advised in the consent form that there is a possibility that their medical 
research record, including identifying information, may be inspected and photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_526803], Version 1.0  
 14 officials of Federal or state government agencies and the Washington University Human 
Research Protection Office.  
 
Enrollment . Enroll ment is defined as the date all of the screening criteria are met and the 
individual agrees to participate .  The enrollment date will be recorded on a case report form . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization.  
Participants will be allocated using a 1:[ADDRESS_683588] to race (self -reported African American 
or “other”) and sex. Randomization sequence concealment will be achieved by [CONTACT_526822] (REDCap) system.81 The study coordinator will verify that all eligibility 
requirements are satisfied  and t hen elicit treatment assignment prior to baseline assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline Assessment  
Demographics . Demographic and other pertinent information, including assistance received, 
adaptive equipment usage, and falls, will be collected.  
 
OARS ADL scale . The O ARS ADL scale[51] will be used to screen for functional performance. 
The OARS ADL has been validated for the older adult ED population[52], is brief and easy to 
administer. Potent ial participants are asked about their ability to perform each of 14 activities. 
Responses are scored on a 0 -2 scale, with higher scores indicating greater independence. 
Individuals who receive a score of 0 on one or more activities or a score of 1 on two or more 
activities will qualify for the study.  
 
Falls Efficacy Scale -International (FES -I). The  Falls Efficacy Scale- International (FES -I)[53] will 
be used to assess participants’ self -efficacy in performing daily activities without falling. The 
FES-I has good test -retest reliability and validity and consists of a list of 16 daily activities (e.g., 
getting in and o ut of bed) on which respondents rate their confidence doing each activity without 
falling on a scale from 1 (very confident) to 10 (no confidence at all). Total FES -I score is the 
sum of each activity score, with higher scores indicating greater fear of falling.  
 
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Scale . Self -
rated health will be measured using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS) Global Scale[54] which measures general perceptions of health. We will use 
two scales: global physical health (overall physical health, physical function, pain, and fatigue) 
and global mental health (quality of life, mental health, satisfaction with social activities, and 
emotional problems).  Reliability and validity  of the scales have been established[54, 55]. 
 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 15 Westmead Home Safety Assessment (WeHSA) . The Westmead Home Safety Assessment 
(WeHSA)[57] will be used to identify the number of environmental hazards in all areas of the 
home (e.g., seating, bedroom, medication management) via [ADDRESS_683589] – Geriatric Version (S -MAST -G). The S -MAST -
G[58] will be used to screen for the presence of an alcohol problem in potential participants. The 
S-MAST -G has been validated for the older adult population[59]. Potential participants will 
answer 10 yes/no questions about their alcohol consumption in the past year; two or more “yes” 
responses indicate a likely alcohol proble m..  
 
Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS -SF). The GDS -SF[60] will be used to assess 
depression levels in participants. The GDS -SF is a 15 -item self -report questionnaire specifically 
designed and validated with the older population, and correlates highly with the original 30 -item 
GDS ( r=.84)[60]. Participants answer yes -or-no questions about their feelings in the past week. 
Total scores range from [ADDRESS_683590] (SBT) . The SBT[61] will be used to screen for severe cognitive impairment. 
The SBT has good validity for older adults[61] and correlates well with the Mini -Mental State 
Exam[62]. This brief, six -item questionnaire assesses cognition, memory, and orientation. 
Incorrect items are scored as the product of the number of errors made and a weighting factor; 
the sum of incorr ect item scores comprises the total score. Total scores range from 0 -28; scores 
of 10 or more are consistent with dementia and other cognitive difficulties. Individuals who 
receive a SBT score 10 or more will not be allowed to participate in the proposed s tudy.  
 
Prescription medications . A medication inventory will be collected.  
 
Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment  (POMA) . Mobility and balance will be assessed 
using the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment  (POMA)[63], a task -oriented gait and 
balance assessment th at has been validated for the older adult population.  
 
Strength, and range of motion of the upper extremity . Strength and range of motion of the upper 
extremity will be assessed using group muscle tests and goniometry and scored as within normal 
limits, w ithin functional limits, or impaired[64]. Strength of the domi nant hand will be assessed 
using a dynamometer.  
 
Pelli- Robson. We will measure visual contrast sensitivity using the Pelli- Robson test[65]. We wil l 
score participants’ binocular contrast sensitivity letter by [CONTACT_31711].  
 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 16 Falls behavioral Scale for Older People (FaB) . Protective behavioral factors to prevent falls will 
be assessed using the FaB. This instrument includes ten behavioral dimensions: cognit ive 
adaptations, protective mobility, avoidance, awareness, pace, practical strategies, displacing 
activities, being observant, changes in level, and getting to the phone[66].  
7.3.3 Intervention and follow up sessions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intervention  
Participants randomized to the intervention group will receive the intervention over [ADDRESS_683591], if possible, implement 
solutions (such as removing a throw rug), create plan for additional hazard removal, begin self -
management training for behavioral and environmental fall risks, and provide training to 
complete the calendar journal. Between visits, the occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526804] t the older 
adult to obtain equipment or home modifications. At the second visit, the occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526805] (such as a tub transfer bench), explain the 
purpose of each new equipment, teach techniques to safely use the equipment, and observe the 
older adult safely using the equipment. The occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526806] -
management training to improve daily activity performance and safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  5 month adherence  
A phone call to evaluate adherence will be made at approximately five months (in anticipation of 
the 6 month booster session).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Six month Booster  
A 6-month booster session will also be provided to assist the older adults with any new fall 
hazards and to reinforce self -management/mindf ulness training techniques. To identify 
additional fall hazards, the occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526807].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monthly monitoring falls  
To record falls, an individually customized calendar journal will be designed for each participant 
for daily recording of falls[48]. Our method of tailoring the calendar journal includes life event 
date anchors, incentives   and personalization[49], we will construct the participant- tailored 
calendar journals[50]. There will be space to record the primary outcome of falls (fall or no fall) 
each day. If a participant falls, they will be instructed to complete a fall form. Calendar journal 
pages and fall forms will be collected monthly via U.S. mail. Falls will be verified with a follow -
up telephone interview by a community coordinator.  
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 17 [IP_ADDRESS]  Raters  
Follow up assessments will conducted by [CONTACT_526828]. The follow -up 
sessions will repeat assessments conducted at the  first study home visit and first phone call.  
7.3.4 Completion/Final Evaluation   
List each assessment to be performed at the participant’s final visit.   
Falls behavioral Scale for Older People (FaB).  Protective behavioral factors to prevent falls will 
be assessed using the FaB. This instrument includes ten behavioral dimensions: cognitive 
adaptations, protective mobility, avoidance, awareness, pace, practical strategies, displacing 
activities, being o bservant, changes in level, and getting to the phone[66].  
 
OARS ADL scale . The OARS ADL scale[51] will be used to screen for functional performance. 
The OARS ADL has been validated for the older adult ED population[52], is brief and easy to 
administer. Potential participants are asked about their ability to perform each of 14 activities. 
Responses are scored on a 0 -2 scale, with high er scores indicating greater independence. 
Individuals who receive a score of 0 on one or more activities or a score of 1 on two or more 
activities will qualify for the study.  
 
Falls Efficacy Scale -International (FES) . The  Falls Efficacy Scale- Internatio nal (FES -I)[53] will 
be used to assess participants’ self -efficacy in performing daily activities without falling . The 
FES-I has good test -retest reliability and validity and consists of a list of 16 daily activities (e.g., 
getting in and out of bed) on which respondents rate their confidence doing each activity without 
falling on a scale from 1 (very confident) to 10 (no confidence at all). Total FES -I score is the 
sum of each activity score, with higher scores indicating greater fear of falling.  
 
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Scale . Self -
rated health will be measured using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System (PROMIS) Global Scale[54] which measures general perceptions of health. We will use 
two scales: global physical health (overall physical health, physical func tion, pain, and fatigue) 
and global mental health (quality of life, mental health, satisfaction with social activities, and 
emotional problems).  Reliability and validity of the scales have been established[54, 55]. 
7.4 Process evaluation  
7.4.1 Recruitment  
Enrollment and retention w ill be tracked by [CONTACT_526829], an online 
data entry program. Recruitment information for each participant will include the potential 
participants’ initials, gender, birthdate, race, zip code, stroke date, admission date, and discharge 
date. Reasons for denying participation in the study as well as study attrition will also be tracked 
via REDCap.   
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 18 7.4.2 Fidelity  
In order to guarantee treatment fidelity, or our ability to provide the same treatment as planned to 
each participant, we follo w similar methods of Weersing, et al[36] and use a Visit by [CONTACT_526830]. This grid specifically outlines the pre, during, and post treatment visit 
requirements for each treatment session. It is designed to be a checklist in which therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526808].  During weekly interventionist meetings, the lead therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526809].  
7.4.3 Dose  
In order to effectively measure the dose of treatment provided for each participant, we will 
measure both the dose that was delivered to each person (minutes of each treatment session and 
number of session) as well as the dose received (recommendations implemented/total 
recommend ations). We will use a spreadsheet or Time Log to track minutes spent in each 
treatment session and another spreadsheet or Prescription Log to track the recommendations 
made and implemented for each participant.  
7.4.4 Adherence  
Adherence measures the participan t’s continued use of the implemented modifications. We will 
calculate adherence using the standardized approach that Cumming, et al [37] used: adherence = 
recommendations used/total recommendations. Interventionists will rate adherence with 
intervention at the final session by [CONTACT_526831], 
implemented and reasons that any r ecommendations were not implemented. Initial adherence 
will be a proportion of the number of recommendations implemented /recommendations 
suggested.  Finally, we will determine the number of recommendations used/recommendations 
suggested at 6 months.  Reas ons for abandoning strategies will be examined using the Adherence 
Log; in which the participant will report on current level of use for each modification:  very 
useful, somewhat useful, not at all useful, no longer use equipment. Any independence that was  
regained by [CONTACT_526832].  
7.4.5 Safety  
 To explore the safety of our study, we will measure the number of falls and the circumstances 
surrounding the falls with a self -report Fall Form used at the 6 month follow up visit. The rate 
and severity of the falls will be calculated using a standardized algorithm established by [CONTACT_526833], 
et al, 1988[38]. We will also track both health care utilization for participants in both groups (# of 
emergency room and out patient visits, # of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and number of days in therapy) 
using the Health Care Utilization Form.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_683592] of modifications and adaptive 
equipment for each participant. This will be tracked using the Invoice Form which includes bot h 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 19 costs from the contractor as well as costs of any equipment ordered from a medical supply 
company or obtained from a community resource (medical equipment lending program).  The 
total amount of money spent on each person will be tracked on this form.

8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS    
8.1 Safety Parameters  
To explore the safety of our study, we will measure the number of falls and the circumstances 
surrounding the falls and  health care utilization for participants in both groups (# of emergency 
room and outpatient  visits, # of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and number of days in therapy) using the Health 
Care Utilization Form.  The rate and severity of the falls will be calculated using a standardized 
algorithm established by [CONTACT_526833], et al, 1988 [38]. We will also track b oth health care utilization for 
participants in both groups (# of emergency room and outpatient  visits, # of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and 
number of days in therapy) using the Health Care Utilization Form.  
8.2 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse even t (AE) are defined as any  unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the 
study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Adverse 
events are to b e recording regardless of their relationship to the study intervention. 
 
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is generally defined as  any untoward medical occurrence that 
results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172677], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital 
anomaly.  
8.3 Reporting Procedures  
All serious adverse events will be reported to the HRPO in the falling time frames: a) death – 
immediately; b) life -threatening within 7 calendar days; c) all other SAEs within [ADDRESS_683594] be made to undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures. If 
voluntary withdrawal occurs, the participant  will be asked to continue scheduled evaluations, 
Protocol Template, Version 1.0  
 21 complete an end -of-study evaluation, and be given appropriate therapy  until the symptoms of any 
AE resolve or the participant’s  condition becomes stable. 
[ADDRESS_683595] is that we will be conservative by 
[CONTACT_526835]. Second, 
estimates of statistical power will be consistent with 
the method of analyses. Our primary outcome is time 
to eve nt; therefore, we will determine the sample size 
and power within the survival data analyses 
framework. The Cumming et al.[ADDRESS_683596] 
similar to our target sample and similar regarding the 
method of fall ascertainment using daily calendars. On 
this basis, we assume that approximately 61% of 
control group participants will fall during [ADDRESS_683597] 30% reduction in falls.105, 106 The Cochrane Review of interventions 
for preventing falls in older, community -dwelling adults reported that randomized trials of home -
safety interventions and personal mobility aids reduced the rate of falls (RaR, 0.59; 95% CI, 
0.42–0.82) among high -risk participants defined as having a history of falling or other risk factor 
for falls.30 Another meta -analysis28 of four randomized trials of environmental interventions, 
which included some of the same studies as the Cochrane Review, reported a 39% reduction in 
the risk of fa lls in high -risk populations, defined as a history of falling in the past year or 
presence of other risk factors for falling. Because our target sample can be defined as “high risk,” 
and because our intervention can be defined as a high -intensity home modi fication, we project a 
30% or greater reduction in fall risk at 12 months after treatment. Figure 6 displays the power as 
a function of total sample size given a fall rate of 42% (event -free rate of 0.58) in the 
intervention group and a fall rate of 0.61 ( event -free rate of 0.39) in the control group, with a 
20% attrition rate. A two -sided log- rank test with an overall sample size of 300 participants (150 
in each group) achieves 84% power at a 0.[ADDRESS_683598] a difference of 0.19 
between 0 .39 and 0.58— the proportions without falls in the control and intervention groups, 
respectively. This corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_683599] high acceptability (at least 80% retention), high fidelity by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_11437] (at least 95% of 
elements and at least 90% of dose delivered), and high adherence to the program (at least 80% of 
modifications in use) at [ADDRESS_683600] limit 
estimates will be used to describe the fall experiences for the intervention and control groups, 
with the log -rank statistic testing for significant difference. Prespecified covariates (e.g., age, 
race, sex, number of reported me dications, mobility, ADL scores, and visual acuity ) will be 
adjusted using the Cox proportional hazards model. We will test the interventions effect using 
the Cox proportional hazards model and adjusting for covariates. The regression coefficient of 
the in dicator variable quantifies the difference in the log hazard of time to first fall between 
intervention and control groups. We will determine whether fall -prevention treatment is superior 
to usual care on secondary outcomes (total number of falls, number o f injurious falls) and 
participant -reported outcomes (daily -activity performance, fall self -efficacy, and global health).  
We expect that the intervention group will experience fewer total falls, fewer injurious falls, 
greater daily -activity performance, gr eater self -efficacy, and greater quality of life compared 
with the usual care group. 
11 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Data Collection Forms

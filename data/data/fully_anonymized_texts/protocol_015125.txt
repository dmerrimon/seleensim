 I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims   
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Creative Arts Therapy (CAT) on pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy in the Infusion Center at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888900]. Findings from a previous pi [INVESTIGATOR_888901] (QOL), resiliency, physical posture, and 
emotional response to pain of pediatric oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy.  
 Specific aims include:  
 a. Does CAT improve the child’s reported QOL?  
 b. Is the child’s resiliency enhanced by [CONTACT_63906]?  
c. Does CAT influence the physical posture of the child?  d. Does CAT impact the child’s emotional response to pain? e. Are patients, families, and staff satisfied with the CAT program?  
 
II. Background and Significance  
Although survival rates of children with cancer are improving, their QOL is known to be 
poorer than their healthy peers.  As survival rates of pediatric cancer now approach 85%, the need for quality psychosocial care including c reative arts has increased (Askins & Moore, 
2008).   Oncology patients are known to have significant morbidity during treatment as a result 
of the surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, but little is published on the day to day effects of 
treatment on the quality of life of pediatric oncology patients (Banks, 2008). Tremolada et al looked at parental perception  of QOL in newly diagnosed children with leukemia and found 
that increasing the knowledge of QOL may improve communication and psychosocial care during  initial treatment for leukemia (2010).  In addition, quality of life among adolescents 
with cancer may be worse during treatment than for those not currently on therapy (Ward-Smith et al., 2007).  Another study has shown that interventions to promote happi[INVESTIGATOR_888902] a good predictor of QOL in adolescent cancer survivors (Bitsko et al., 2008).   
 It has been acknowledged that even the act of coming to the clinic weekly for chemotherapy infusions impacts on the patient’s life.  In addition, v incristine, a commonly used 
chemotherapy, is also well -known to cause significant morbidity (leg pain, numbness, tingling, 
and constipation) requiring dose -limiting regimes.  Steroids are another common medication

COMIRB #10 -1028 
Version Date: 4/8/2019   PI: [INVESTIGATOR_888898], CPNP  with toxicities affecting QOL.  Toxicities of steroids include weakness, sleep and mood 
disturbance, and pain with dose reduction (Sanford et al., 2008; Hinds et al., 2007).   
 
Resilience is a subset of QOL that has been studied in pediatric chronic illness including cancer (Haase et al., 2004).  Resilience has been defined as a characteristic that moderates stress and 
the ability to cope with change or misfortune (Wagnild & Young, 1993).  Resilient individuals have positive outcomes in spi[INVESTIGATOR_888903] (Rew & Horner, 2003).  Therefore nurses who understand res ilience can promote those characteristics during times of illness or stress (Ahern 
et al., 2006).  There is a paucity of literature directly studying resilience in pediatric oncology patients and further work is warranted.  
 Emotional response to pain is another subset of QOL that has been measured in this population.  It is well known that pediatric oncology patients experience pain (Lervat, 2009).  Experts 
recommend rigorous research using established measures to evaluate childrens’ response to 
pain (McGrath et al., 2008).  The Faces scale has been studied with children as young as 5 years to evaluate their emotional response to pain compared with their parents’ perceptions (Breau et al., 2001).  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_888904] (Madden et al., 2010).  
 Physical functioning and muscle strength are aspects of QOL that have been shown to be worse than healthy peers in children with cancer (Hartman et al., 2008).  This aspect may also be affected by [CONTACT_888927].  Long -
term central venous access is critical in pediatric cancer patients and the evolution of these devices has improved QOL in terms of pain and distress of venipuncture (Spagrud, 2008).  The 
literature is rich with discussion of complications and risk of infection, but little is published 
about the effects on body image and QOL (Albanese, 1993; Nam, 2010).  Anecdotally, patients have improved body awareness and posture (less kyphosis) after CAT.  In addition, it has been postulated that increased kyphosis may correspond with psychosocial factors including anxiety, depression, and insecurity . Body awareness is a type of physical functioning that may be 
measured by [CONTACT_888928].  Measuring posture with an inclinometer has been shown to be reliable, but further work is needed to establish validity (Lewis & Valentine, 2010).  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_888905] a way to physically measure an individual’s sense of self by [CONTACT_888929].    The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is one intervention that has been 
shown to improve QOL in this population.  Current trends show increasing popularity of the 
use of CAM in even among children with cancer.  Martel et al  (2005) looked at prevalence of 
use of CAM in children.  In their survey, almost 50% of the children used at least one type of CAM.  Specifically to cancer, in 2009, Post-White et al used a survey of 281 patients to show that CAM was used in 59% of pediatric cancer patients versus 36% of general pediatric 
patients.  The authors confirmed that children with cancer and other chronic illnesses use more 
CAM therapi[INVESTIGATOR_888906].  Roth et al (2009) examined pediatric oncologists’ perceptions of CAM and found that although they place importance in CAM, they lack time and knowledge to ask about patients’ use of CAM.  These authors recommend CAM research in pediatric oncology on modalities that could improve QOL.  
 
CAT is a subset of CAM that may improve QOL.  CAT is a broad term encompassing the 
modalities of dance/movement, music, art. Bringing creativity into health care is a current trend in oncology nursing and throughout the medical professions (Garland et al., 2007; Lane, 2006; Petterson, 2001; Strickland, 2008).  There is a growing body of literature establishing the use 
 Page 3 of 10 
COMIRB #10 -1028 
Version Date: 4/8/2019   PI: [INVESTIGATOR_888898], CPNP  of CAT, but the studies use non-standardized tools, small sample sizes, adult populations, and 
non-rigorous designs.  Much of the work on CAT in cancer patients studies adult populations 
using qualitative measures (Forzoni et al, 2010; Jones et al., 2009; Visser, et al, 2008; Bar -Sela, 
et al., 2007; Nainis et al., 2006).  Other work looked at the family caregivers of patients with 
cancer and showed significantly reduced stress, anxiety, and increased positive emotions after a creative arts intervention (Walsh et al., 2004).  Randomized controlled studies are in the literature and have shown improvement in QOL, but only for the population of women with breast cancer  (Oster et al, 2006; Monti et al, 2006; Svensk et al, 2009; Thyme et al, 2009).  
Music was shown to decrease heart rate in children with leukemia, but the therapeutic aspects were not studied (Kemper et al., 2008).  The literature is rich with other exampl es of types of 
music, art, movement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_888907], but there are few rigorous studies to document the importance of CAT during the cancer treatment (Sencer et al, 2007; Dibell-Hope, 2000; O’Callagha n et al, 2007; Robb et al, 
2003; Barrera, 2002; Hilliard, 2006).  
 Therefore, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_888908] a mixed-model approach with a randomized, controlled phase comparing CAT to a control.  Pre - and 
post- measurements using the PedsQL showed statistically significant improvem ent on Parent 
report of child’s hurt (problems with having a lot of pain), p=0.03 and Parent report of child’s nausea (becoming nauseated while thinking about medical treatment), p=0.0061.  The second non-randomized phase pre - and post - tested any child in  group session of CAT.  The subjects 
showed improved mood with statistical significance on the Faces Scale (p < 0.01), and patients were more excited (p < 0.05), happi[INVESTIGATOR_3694] (p < 0.02), and less nervous (p < 0.02) on the Emotional Responses Checklist (Madden et al, 2010).   
 Rationale  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_888909];  therefore we propose a study with a 
larger sample size and broader inclusion criteria.  We would also like to explore outcomes of resilience and body awareness measured by [CONTACT_888930][INVESTIGATOR_799].   
  
Significance  
Nurses have been shown to provide valuable information on QOL for this population (Klaassen et al, 2010).  In addition, the pediatric oncology nurse is in a key position to inc orporate the art 
and science of nursing to improve psychosocial treatment outcomes (Cantrell, 2007).  
Therefore this nursing research study will provide valuable insight to contribute to the body of 
knowledge of CAM for pediatric oncology patients.  The use of CAM for pediatric oncology 
patients may improve QOL, resiliency, emotional response, and body awareness.

See above regarding the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   Small sample size limited the statistical 
significance. 
 IV. Research  Methods  
A. Outcome Measure(s)   
1. Peds QL —Cancer module 
The PedsQL 4.0 Cancer Module is evolved from the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale (Varni, 1998). The system employs a Parent -Proxy Report for ages 2-18 years and a 
companion Child Self -Report for children aged five years and older.  Validity and 
reliability testing for both the Core Scale and Cancer Module has been extensive.   
 Page 4 of 10 
COMIRB #10 -1028 
Version Date: 4/8/2019   PI: [INVESTIGATOR_888898], CPNP  Reliability, assessed by [CONTACT_888931], yielded coefficient alphas ranging from 
.80-.90 across total and individual scales and are, thus, appropriate for the group 
comparisons planned in this study.  The Cancer Module is a 27-item instrument that assesses eight subscales (Pain and hurt, nausea, procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety, worry, cognitive problems, perceived physical appearance, and communication).  It is easily completed by [CONTACT_888932] 10 minutes and reverse-scored and linearly-transformed in five minutes or less.  Validity for both the Core Scale and the Cancer 
Module was established by [CONTACT_888933]; similarly, construct validity for both 
measures was performed by [CONTACT_888934] a group of healthy matched controls.  In all cases, the Peds QL 4.[ADDRESS_1244680] been successfully employed in several small studies of children 
with cancer (Bhat, 2005; Meeske et al, 2004).  The PedsQL has been shown to be the most responsive to change when compared with other measures of QOL used with children undergoing chemotherapy (Banks et al, 2008; Klaassen et al, 2010).  
 
2. The Resilience Scale (RS)  
The RS -14 is a 14-item scale using a 7 -point rating (1 -7).  The construct of resilience is 
measured by [CONTACT_9873]: personal competence and acceptance of self and life.  
Wagnild and Young have completed psychometric testing that established internal consistency reliability and concurrent validity (Wagnild & Young, 1993).  Many studies have validated that the scale may be used with samples of any age or ethnic 
background (Ahern et al, 2006), but it is written at a 6
th grade level.  The authors who 
developed the tool are currently using it in adolescents (personal communication, 
5/25/10).  Given that it is expected that half the population of this study will be teenagers, this tool will be used with subjects ages 12 and over to obtain initial data on CAT’s effect on resilience.  
 
3. Faces Scale  
The Faces Scale has been used for evaluating emotional responses to pain on children 3-17 years old.  It is a one page form with nine faces in order of happy to upset.  Numerical values are given to each face as determined by [CONTACT_888935]’ perspectives for an affective value by [CONTACT_7939] 200 children to directly scale the feelings depi[INVESTIGATOR_888910].  Consistent rating was measured by [CONTACT_888936] 5 years regardless of age, 
gender, or health status (McGrath, 1990).  The scale is a facial affective scale and has been integrated as a routine measure for management of acute, recurrent, and chronic pain (McGrath, 1990; McGrath et al., 1996).  For children less than 3 years old, parents will be asked to complete the Faces Scale.  Although this scale has been used for 
emotional response to pain, it is felt to be an appropriate measure for the emotional 
response to the discomfort and anxiety in the infusion room.  
4. Postural Measurement  
Thoracic kyphosis will be measured using two gravity dependent inclinometers (Isomed Inc.).  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_888911] a registered nurse or pediatric nurse practitioner.  The feet of the inclinometers will be placed over the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_888912] T1, T2 and T12, L1.  The measurements will be taken 
in relaxed standing and measured 3 times in succession.  Clinical assessment of the thoracic kyphosis angle is considered essential in postural examination, but can be time 
 Page 5 of 10 
COMIRB #10 -1028 
Version Date: 4/8/2019   PI: [INVESTIGATOR_888898], CPNP  consuming when measured radiographically (Lewis, 2010).  Lewis and Valentine 
studied intra -rater reliability in subjects with and without symptoms and found 
measurements of less than 1.[ADDRESS_1244681] reliability established excellent intra -rater reliability.  Although validity of 
this measure is less studied, the measurement is thought to provide guidance of how much change of the kyphoscoliosis angle is a real consequence of interventi on over 
time (Lewis, 2010).   
 
5. Patient/Family Surveys  
A brief ten minute written survey will be administered to subjects to ascertain level of satisfaction with the program.  
 
B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:  Study Design and Research Methods  
1. Population  
The Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders (CCBD) at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888913] 240 new Oncology patients each year.  Approximately 45% of these patients receive v incristine, a chemotherapy agent that is known to affect 
physi cal functioning. In addition, about 25% of these patients receive steroids, another 
medication known to affect physical functioning and quality of life.  About half of the new patients each year are anticipated to fit the inclusion criteria.  Therefore, we expect approximately 100 eligible subjects per year, with a 50% attrition rate, for a total sample size of 100 subjects over a two year period.  
 Enrollment for this study was reached in 2019.  At this time, an additional 10 patients 
will be allowed to enr oll on study to help supplement the data .  
 
2. Eligibility Criteria  
Inclusion  
• Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders (CCBD) patient with Oncology or Neuro -oncology diagnosis  
• No more than 2 previous session s of CAT as an outpatient in the CCBD  
• English speaking  
• Receiving outpatient chemotherapy, biotherapy, or transfusions in the infusion 
center approximately weekly for at least 3 months.  
• Ages 3 to 18 years  
       Exclusion  
• Hematology or other patients in the infusion center  
• Patients who have previously received more than 2 sessions of CAT in the 
infusion center  
• Non-English speaking patients  
 
3. Study Design  A repeated measures design will be used with each patient serving as his/her own 
control.  
 Any Oncology patient in the CCBD who has not previously received more than two sessions of CAT in the outpatient unit  and who will be receiving approximately weekly 
infusions of at least one hour in the infusion center will be identified by a research assistant.  The study will be explained to the patient/family and informed consent will

COMIRB #10 -1028 
Version Date: 4/8/2019   PI: [INVESTIGATOR_888898], CPNP  be obtained by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_649973].  A demographic 
form will be completed including the information of diagnosis, age, treatment, 
education al level of parents, zip code, prior experience with art, music, movement.   
 
The intervention will consist of approximately weekly CAT in the infusion center during cancer therapy.  The interventionist is a Master’s prepared, licensed dance/movement thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_888914].  The 
CAT includes dance/movement such as playing with a parachute, simple yoga 
breathing and postures, and work with physioballs.  The music includes singing, 
listening to music, and playing instr uments.  The art consists of drawing, finger 
painting, working with clay.  The CAT may occur in individual sessions in private infusion rooms, or in groups in the middle of the infusion center.  The CAT is not only a distraction, but also a therapeutic process addressing the stressors of cancer and its 
treatment.  The “dose” of CAT will be recorded (number and type of sessions) and will 
be factored into the analysis.    The subjects and/or parents will be tested with all instruments before the intervention,  
and approximately every [ADDRESS_1244682] report (ages 5 and over) and a parent report.  The Resilience Scale is a self-report and will be used for ages 12 and 
over.  The Faces Scale will use parent report for ages less than 5 and self -report for 
ages 5 and over.  In order t o confirm consistency, the posture measure will be 
completed by [CONTACT_978] (nurse practitioner) or registered nurse on the study after training 
with the manual included with the inclinometer tool.  
 Off Study Criteria  
1.  Subject discontinues CAT  
2.  Unable to complete 4 time points in 6 months  
 C. Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection Tools  
The anticipated risks include psychological distress incurred by [CONTACT_888937].  This risk will be minimized by 
[CONTACT_888938]’s prepared, experienced dance/movement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  The patients’ social workers through the clinic will be available during the intervention as well.  
    
D. Potential Scientific Problems  
Based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], the anticipated scientific problem is slow accrual due to unforeseen 
events during the traumatic time of a new diagnosis in pediatric oncology.  We are unable 
to randomize because CAT is standard of care for any patient in the infusion  center and 
therefore we feel it is unethical to deny CAT to a control arm.  Therefore, we will compare the subjects to themselves over time to look at longitudinal changes of CAT.

E. Data Anal ysis Plan   
The primary outcome is Peds QL at approximately 3 months;  secondary outcomes will be 
the Resilience Scale, Faces Scale, and postural measurement at approximately 3 months.  
A repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to analyze the primary and 
secondary outcomes. We will also use the repeated measures analysis of covariance with the addition of covariates, depending on their statistical significance, such as gender, age, cancer diagnosis, and previous exposure to arts/music/dance. All of the analysis will be adjusted for baseline measures.   
We expect to recruit [ADDRESS_1244683] patients will be equally distributed in the 
following 3 categories: receiving low (0 -3), intermediate (4 -6) and high (7+) CAT sessions 
due to the nature of each  patient’s random visits. Power analysis was done based on pair -
wised T -Test with these assumptions for simplicity.  With 33 patients in each group, 
assuming 80% power and 0.[ADDRESS_1244684] size of 0.813. This is to say 
that 80% of the Peds QL scores in the lower session CAT group will be below the average of scores in the higher session CAT group.  Thus, what we would expect to see in the positive dose- response relationship.  
We will also conduct subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_888939].  
F. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained  
Integrative and holistic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_888915].  We know that 
families are using alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_888916].  We therefore strive to build a body of literature showing evidence that CAT helps children 
with cancer feel better.

In this form, we use the words “you” and “your.”   If you are reading this form and deciding for 
someone else, the words ‘you’ and ‘your’ refer to that other person, not to you.
You are being asked to be in a research study.  This form provides you with information about 
the study. 
A member of the research team will describe this study to you and answer all of your 
questions. Please read the information below and ask questions about anything you don’t 
understand before deciding whether or not to take part. 
Why is this study being done?
This study plans to learn more about how creative arts therapy
 will affect your quality of life 
during your treatment for cancer.  
You are being asked to be
 in this  research study because you will be receiving outpatient 
therapy in the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders for the next few months.  
Other people in this study
Up to 110 people from Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888920].   
What happens if I join this study?
If you decide to join this study:
Before the study starts, you will be asked to complete a demographic form with a 
member of the study team.
  This will help us find out more about you, your therapy, 
and what kind of experience you have had with art, music, and movement.   
You will be asked to complete the following measurements before the study starts 
and then 3 more times over a three
 to six month period (depending on how often you 
come to the clinic for your regularly scheduled visits).  You will complete these with 
a member of the study team to assess the effect of creative arts therapy on your 
quality of life during your treatment for cancer:
oPedsQL – This is a survey that asks questions about your level  of pain and 
hurt, anxiety, worry, problems with thinking, your physical appearance, and

portion of this survey.  
oResilience Scale – This is a scale that measures  how well you are able to cope 
with the changes in your life that have come with your cancer diagnosis and 
treatment.  This scale has 25 items and should take less than 10 minutes to 
complete.
oFaces Scale – This is a scale that measures your emotional response to your 
treatment for cancer.  This
 scale has 9 items and should take less than 5 
minutes to complete.
oPosture Measurement – A member of the study staff will measure the angle 
of your back three times during each of these visits.  This should take less than 
10 minutes to complete.  
oPatient/Family Survey  – This is a  survey that asks questions about your 
parent’s satisfaction with the creative arts therapy program.  This survey has 
13 questions and should take less than 10 minutes to complete.
Once you have completed these four visits over three to six months, you will be 
finished with this study.  
You will be allowed to do creative arts therapy  during your clinic visits as many times as it is 
offered and as much as you would like to participate.  This study will not limit the number of 
times you can do creative arts therapy, and it will not require you to do more creative arts 
therapy visits than you want to do.  We will track how many times you receive creative arts 
therapy over a three-month period in the clinic.  
What are the possible discomforts or risks?
Discomforts you may experience  while in this study include some stress you may feel while 
completing the measurements.  If you feel this stress, please let the study staff know.  
Other possible risks include the risk of the loss of confidentiality of your protected health 
information; however, the chance of such a loss is small. Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888921]. No identifiable information about you 
will be published or presented at scientific meetings.
What are the possible benefits of the study?
This study is designed for the researcher to learn more about how creative arts therapy affects 
children who are
 receiving treatment for cancer.  
This study is not designed to treat any illness or improve your health.

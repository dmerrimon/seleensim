Adult  Survivors  of Childhood  Acute  Lymphoblastic  Leukemia  
Principal  Investigators:  Kevin  Krull,  PhD; Wei  Liu, PhD

Brief  Overview:  A common  and potentially  debilitating  late effect  of childhood  cancer  
treatment  is neurocognitive  impairment,  frequently  in the domain  of executive  dysfunction,  
which  can limit educational  attainment,  employment,  and quality  of life. Among  the 
survivors  of childhood  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  in the SJLIFE  cohort,  the 
rate of executive  function  impairment  has been  shown  as high as 58.8%,  with moderate  to 
severe  impairment  rates  as high as 33.5%,  and risk for impairment  increased  with time 
from  diagnosis.  Given  the potential  of pervasive  impact  of neurocognitive  impairment  
on daily  life, interventions  directed  at reducing  neurocognitive  dysfunction  among  
childhood  cancer  survivors  with long-term follow -up are needed.  Transcranial  Direct  
Current  Stimulation  (tDCS),  a form  of non-invasive  brain  stimulation,  is a potentially  
useful  tool to enhance  cognitive  function.  tDCS  involves  modulation  of cerebral  cortex

Intervention:  Transcranial  Direct  Current  Stimulation  
In phase  I, the short -term effect  of tDCS  intervention  will be evaluated  in the clinical  
setting  using  a randomized  cross -over trial. The survivors  will be randomized  to receive  
either  the tDCS  intervention  at the current  dose level  of 1mA  or Sham  for 15 minutes  on 
day 1, with the other  treatment  given  on day 2 (i.e. those  who got tDCS  intervention  on 
day 1 will get sham  on day 2 and vice versa).  The tDCS  intervention  will be delivered  by 
[CONTACT_696716]  (1x1-CT).  
Neurocognitive  testing  using  the NIH Toolbox  will be conducted  within  two hours  of 
completing  stimulation  each day. 
In phase  II, the feasibility  and potential  efficacy  of self-administration  of the tDCS  
intervention  paired  with cognitive  training  will be evaluated  over [ADDRESS_945452]- intervention  using  remote  assessment.

Human  Subjects:  There  is low risk to participants  related  to the tDCS.  Potential  side 
effects  include  redness and slight tingling  at the  site of stimulation,  and all side effects  are 
reversible.  Recent  meta -analyses  show  side effects  to occur  no more  frequently  than 
placebo  conditions.  Time  commitment  could  be seen as a burden  and some  of the questions  
may make  the participant  uncomfortable.  Adverse  events  will be monitored,  reported,  
and treated  accordingly.

2.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Background  
 
With  recent  advances  in treatment  the survival  rate of childhood  cancer  exceeds  
80%,[ADDRESS_945456]  
of childhood  cancer  treatment  is neurocognitive  impairment,  particularly  
executive  dysfunction,  which  can limit  educational  attainment  and 
employment.2 
 
Prevalence  estimates  of neurocognitive  dysfunction  range  from  20% to 80% 
of the population  of cancer  survivors,  depending  on the diagnoses,  treatment,  
cognitive  assessment  procedure,  and definition  of impairment.3-6 Treatments  
such as cranial  radiation,  antimetabolite  chemotherapy  (i.e. methotrexate)  and 
corticosteroids  increase  the risk of neurocognitive  impairment.3,7-9 A recent  
study2 among  the survivors  of childhood  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  
in the SJLIFE  cohort  showed  that the rate of neurocognitive  impairment  to be 
as high as 58.8%  for executive  functions,  the most  common  domain  of 
impairment,  with moderate  to severe  impairment  rates  as high as 33.5%.  
Furthermore,  risk of impairment  increased  with time from  diagnosis.  Across  
individual  skills,  moderate  to severe  impairment  (defined  as a score  <7th 
percentile  compared  to the normal  population)  rates  of 25%,  18%,  and 3.5%  
were  seen for cognitive  flexibility,  cognitive  fluency  and working  memory,  
respectively.[ADDRESS_945457]  characterized  
neurocognitive  impairment  in long-term survivors  of childhood  cancer,  
limited  research  has focused  on developi[INVESTIGATOR_696706]-established  late effects.13-15 Thus  there  is a strong  need  for intervention  
studies  that will improve  the neurocognitive  impairment  among  these  
survivors.  
2.2 Rationale:  
 
Cognitive  training  has been  used in an attempt  to improve  neurocognitive  
impairment  in cancer  survivors.  We recently  completed  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_97552] a 
cognitive  stimulation  trial to improve  function  in adult  survivors  of childhood  
cancer.  Twenty -one survivors  completed  six months  of regular  cognitive  
exercises,  with pre- and post-neurocognitive  testing.  Compared  to an equated

cortex  excitability  by [CONTACT_696719]16. 
tDCS  is a technique  that applies  safe, low level  direct  current  through  large  
pads on the scalp  to stimulate the  underlying  brain  region,  with current  level  < 
0.10 C/cm2 (as a reference,  tissue  damage  occurs  at levels  of ~ 200 C/cm2 or 
higher).16 The schematic  below  demonstrates  the manner  in which  the tDCS  
intervention  is delivered  to the participants.  
 
 
 
A cross -over study  of tDCS  on working  memory  using  healthy  volunteers  
showed  that tDCS  modulated  working  memory  performance  (measured  by 
[CONTACT_31711]  n-back)  by [CONTACT_696720]  (DLPFC)  brain  activity  
in a polarity -specific  way,  in that anodal  tDCS  enhanced  the performance  
related  to working memory.17 Another study18 in healthy  volunteers  found that 
anodal  tDCS  of DLPFC  or the primary  motor  cortex  (M1)  increased  
performance  on a cognitive  or motor  task, respectively.18 
 
tDCS  is also a safe method  for enhancing  cortical responsivity.  A recent  meta - 
analysis19 looked  at over 200 studies  for adverse  events  (AE)  related  to active

tDCS  and found  that 56% of studies  reported  mild AEs and no studies  
reported  more  than mild  AE’s. The  most  common  AE’s  reported  were  itching,  
tingling,  mild headache,  and discomfort,  however,  none  of the AE’s  differed  
in frequency  between  the placebo  (sham  application)  and active  treatment  
groups.  Levels  of less than [ADDRESS_945459]  demonstrated  efficacy  of tDCS  intervention  in 
reducing  neurocognitive  impairments  among  patients  suffering  from  strokes,20 
depression,21,22 psychosis,  and Alzheimer’s  disease23. However,  the usefulness  
of tDCS  has not been  evaluated  in long-term adult  survivors  of childhood  
cancer  exhibiting  neurocognitive  impairments.  Since  these  adults  have  likely  
experienced  neurocognitive  impairment  for many  years,  we believe  the 
application  of tDCS  will enhance  their ability  to benefit  from  cognitive  training.  
 
We propose  to conduct  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_696707] a 5-week  tDCS  intervention  paired  with cognitive  training  to 
improve  executive  function  in long-term adult  survivors  of childhood  ALL.  
Stimulation  and training  will be conducted  at home  twice  per week  for five 
weeks.  However,  prior  to initiating  the home  trial, we propose  to conduct  a 
trial in the clinic  in order  to evaluate  the short -term effect  of tDCS  on measures  
of executive  function.  This clinic -based  trial will also provide  participants  with 
on-sight  experience  with tDCS  under  direct  observation  prior  to beginning  the 
home -based  intervention  under  remote  observation.

A member  of the study  team  will confirm  potential  participant  eligibility  as 
defined  in Section  3.1-3.2, complete  and sign the ‘Participant  Eligibility  
Checklist’.  The study team  will enter  the eligibility  checklist  information  into 
the Patient  Protocol  Manager  (PPM)  system.  Eligibility  will be reviewed,  and 
a research  participant -specific  consent  form  and assent  document  (where  
applicable)  will be generated.  The signed  consent/assent  form  must  be faxed  
or emailed  to the CPDMO  at 595-6265  in order  to complete  the enrollment.  
 
The CPDMO  is staffed  7:30 am-5:[ADDRESS_945464],  Monday  through  Friday.  A 
staff member  is on call Saturday,  Sunday,  and holidays  from  8:00 am to 5:00 
pm. Enrollments  may be requested  during  weekends  or holidays  by [CONTACT_696722]  “On Call”  cell phone  ([PHONE_3788] ) or referencing  the “On Call

feasibility  of self-administering  tDCS  over long-term (5 weeks  with two 
sessions  per week)  using  a mobile  tDCS  device  and its potential  efficacy  will 
be evaluated  in Phase  II. The 5-week  intervention  will be paired  with cognitive  
stimulation  using  the Lumosity  Brain  Games  program  (www.lumosity.com ). 
This program  involves  cognitive  exercises  designed  to enhance  executive  
function  and processing  speed,  to be performed  on an institutionally  
provided  iPad.  Cognitive  stimulation  activities  can be completed  in 15-20 
minutes  per session.  The study  schema  is displayed  in the Figure  below:

A cross -over randomized  trial will be used in Phase  I. The survivors  will be 
randomized  to receive  either  the tDCS  intervention  at the current  dose level  of 
1mA  or Sham  for 15 minutes  on day 1 and then on day 2 the other  treatment  
will be provided  (i.e. those  who got tDCS  intervention  of day 1 will get sham  
on day 2 and vice versa).  The tDCS  intervention  will be delivered  by [CONTACT_696723]  (1x1-CT). The 
effect  of one session  to tDCS  is expected  to last for about  two hours  thus 
conducting  the second  session the  next day will provide  sufficient  time for the 
“wash -out” and good  justification  for using  a cross -over design.  
 
In phase  II, the feasibility  and efficacy  of long-term (5 week)  self- 
administration  of the tDCS  intervention  will be evaluated  in concurrence  with 
self-administered  cognitive  stimulation.  In this phase  the research  participants  
will be taught  to use the mobile  tDCS  device and will be provided with one to 
take home.  The device  will be programmed  by [CONTACT_696724].  The research  participants  
will use the device  twice  per week  as directed.  Before  each session,  the 
participant  will use an institutionally  provided  iPad for video  conferencing  
with the study  center  to obtain  a unique  access  code  to start the tDCS  device  
and ensure  proper  device  placement.  Each  stimulation  session  for each 
participant  will have  a unique  access  code.  An AE evaluation  will be 
conducted  by a trained  study  team  member  every  week.  Research  participants  
will complete  remote  neurocognitive  testing  via the iPad before  and after 
phase  II.

with the anode  attached  to the left frontal  region  (F3) and the 
cathode  attached  over the right  eyebrow  (Fp2).  Participants  
will be randomized to receive the intervention  on day [ADDRESS_945468]  Current  Stimulation  – Mobile  System:  
 
The mobile  transcranial  direct  current  stimulation  system  is 
manufactured  by  [CONTACT_696726]  a  battery  
pack,  control  unit and a self-positioning  headband  with 
sponges.  Participants  will be given  the device  after completing  
the clinical  portion  of the study  and trained  in correct  usage.  
Participants  will complete  two stimulation  sessions  per week  
for [ADDRESS_945469]  
electrode  placement,  then provide  the code  to initiate  treatment.  
Each  session  will be monitored  for compliance  and to assess  
any adverse  events.  
4.2.3 Cognitive  Training:  
 
Survivors  who complete  phase  I and continue  to phase  II will 
begin  the 5 week  cognitive  stimulation  program.  Participants  
will use the supplied  iPad to complete  online  cognitive  
stimulation  training  within  one hour of every  at-home  tDCS  
session.  The cognitive  training  program  was developed  by 
[CONTACT_696727]  (see Appendix  for description  of Lumosity  program)  
and involves  training  of attention,  processing  speed,  working  
memory,  and executive  function  skill using  cognitive  tasks.  
Participants  will be asked  to engage  in training  for 20 minutes  
a day, two days per week.  Five cognitive  tasks  will be 
presented  during  each training  session. Survivors will  complete  
5-weeks  of stimulation  and training.  The Lumosity  program  
records  the day and time of training  and performance  on the 
training  activities  for each participant,  and these  records  are 
available  to study  staff via internet.  Adherence  to training  and

change  in performance  following  stimulation  sessions  will be 
examined.  
 
At the end of the 5-week  intervention,  participants  will mail 
back  the iPad  and tDCS  device  in a postage -paid and addressed  
FedEx  box provided  to them  at their study  visit.  
 
4.3 Adverse  Event  Monitoring:  
 
Reports  of adverse  events  will be monitored.  Adverse  events  will 
be surveyed  at the beginning  of each video  conference,  with 
symptoms  reports  for the prior  stimulation  session.  Adverse  event  
information  will be collected  by [CONTACT_696728]  
(PRISE),  frequency  and intensity  of side effect  rating  (FISER),  
and global  rating  of side effects  burden  (GRSEB).  The PRISE  
form  assesses  the presence  of side effects  for a variety  of 
biological  systems.  For each of the nine organ/function  systems  
(gastrointestinal,  nervous  system,  heart,  eyes/ears,  skin,  
genital/urinary,  sleep,  sexual  functioning,  and other),  the 
participant  indicates  the presence  of a side effect,  and if present,  
the tolerability  of the side effect  (tolerable  or distressing).  The 
FISER  and GRSEB  assess  three  domains  of side effect  impact:  
frequency,  intensity,  and burden.  Each  domain  is rated  on a 7- 
point  Likert  scale  (i.e. Frequency,  ranging  from  no side effects  to 
present  all the time;  Intensity,  ranging  from  no side effects  to 
intolerable;  and Burden,  ranging  from  no impairment  to unable  to 
function  due to side effects).  Reliability  and validity  have  been  
reported.

5.2 Evaluations  During  Therapy  
 
5.2.1 NIH  Toolbox  – Cognitive  Battery  
We will use the three  tests from  the Cognitive  Battery  of the 
NIH Toolbox24 to evaluate  the acute  effect  of tDCS  on 
executive  function.  These  three  measures  have  a computerized  
format  and are nationally  standardized.  Testing  will occur  post- 
intervention  (total  2 times)  during  phase  I. 
 
NIH Toolbox  Dimensional  Change  Card  Sort Test (DCCS):  
The DCCS  specifically  taps cognitive  flexibility,  with 
performance  generally  increasing  through  childhood  and then

Regardless  of whether  the event  is internal  or external  (for 
example,  an IND safety  report  by [CONTACT_696729] 
21 CFR  312.32),  only adverse  events  that constitute  
unanticipated  problems  are reportable  to the St. Jude  IRB.  
As further  described  in the definition  of unanticipated  
problem,  this includes  any event  that in the PI’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_696711]:  
 Unexpected  (in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency)  given  (1) 
the research  procedures  that are described  in the protocol -related  
documents,  such as the IRB-approved  research  protocol  and 
informed  consent  document,  as well as other  relevant  information  
available  about  the research;  (2) the observed  rate of occurrence  
(compared  to a credible  baseline  for comparison);  and (3) the 
characteristics  of the subject  population  being  studied;  and 
 
 Related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research;  and 
 
 Serious;  or if not serious  suggests  that the research  places  subjects  
or others  at a greater  risk of harm  (including  physical,  
psychological,  economic,  or social  harm)  than was previously  
known  or recognized.  
 
Unrelated,  expected  deaths  do not require  reporting  to the IRB.  Though  death  
is “serious”,  the event  must  meet  the other  two requirements  of “related  or 
possibly  related”  and “unexpected/unanticipated”  to be considered  reportable.  
Deaths  meeting  reporting  requirements  are to be reported  immediately  to the 
St. Jude IRB,  but in no event  later than [ADDRESS_945478]   to  reporting   adverse  
experiences:  
 
Serious  Adverse  Event:  Any adverse  event  temporally  associated  
with  the subject’s  participation  in research  that meets  any 
of the following  criteria:  
 results  in death;  
 is life-threatening  (places  the subject  at immediate  risk of 
death  from  the event  as it occurred);  
 requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425];  
 results  in a persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity;

 results  in a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect;  or 
 any other  adverse  event  that, based  upon  appropriate  
medical  judgment,  may jeopardize  the subject’s  health  and 
may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one 
of the other  outcomes  listed  in this definition  (examples  of 
such events  include:  any substantial disruption  of the ability  
to conduct  normal  life functions,  allergic  bronchospasm  
requiring  intensive  treatment  in the emergency  room  or at 
home,  blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in 
inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development  of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse),  a congenital  anomaly/birth  
defect,  secondary  or concurrent  cancer,   medication  overdose,  
or is any medical  event  which  requires  treatment  to prevent  
any of the medical  outcomes  previously  listed.  
Unexpected Adverse Event:  
 Any adverse  event  for which  the specificity  or severity  is 
not consistent  with the protocol -related  documents,  
including  the applicable  investigator  brochure,  IRB 
approved  consent  form,  Investigational  New  Drug  (IND)  or 
Investigational  Device  Exemption  (IDE)  application,  or 
other  relevant  sources  of information,  such as product  
labeling  and package  inserts;  or if it does appear  in such 
documents,  an event  in which  the specificity,  severity  or 
duration  is not consistent  with the risk information  included  
therein;  or 
 The observed  rate of occurrence  is a clinically  significant  
increase  in the expected  rate (based  on a credible  baseline  
rate for comparison);  or 
 The occurrence  is not consistent  with the expected  natural  
progression  of any underlying  disease,  disorder,  or condition  
of the subject(s)   experiencing  the  adverse  event   and  the 
subject’s  predisposing  risk factor  profile  for the adverse  
event.

either  multicenter  or single -center  research  projects.

External  Events:  Events  experienced  by [CONTACT_696730] a 
site external  to the jurisdiction  of the St. Jude  Institutional  
Review  Board  (IRB)  or in a study  for which  St. Jude  is not 
the coordinating  center  or the IRB of record.  
 
Unanticipated  Problem  Involving  Risks  to Subjects  or Others:  An 
unanticipated  problem  involving  risks  to subjects  or others  
is an event  which  was not expected  to occur  and which  
increases  the degree  of risk posed  to research  participants.  
Such  events,  in general,  meet  all of the following  criteria:  
 unexpected;  
 related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research;  
and 
 suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others  at a greater  
risk of harm  (including  physical,  psychological,  economic,  
or social  harm)  than was previously  known  or recognized. 
An unanticipated problem  involving  risk to subjects  or others 
may exist  even when actual  harm does  not occur  to any 
participant.  
 
 
Consistent  with  FDA  and OHRP  guidance  on reporting  unanticipated  
problems  and adverse  events  to IRBs,  the St. Jude  IRB 
does  not require  the submission  of external  events , for 
example  IND safety  reports,  nor is a summary  of such  
events/reports  required;  however,  if an event  giving  rise to 
an IND safety  or other  external  event  report  constitutes  an 
“unanticipated  problem  involving  risks  to subjects  or 
others”  it must  be reported  in accordance  with  this policy.  
In general,  to be reportable  external  events  need  to have  
implications  for the conduct  of the study  (for example,  
requiring  a significant  and usually  safety -related  change  in 
the protocol  and/or  informed  consent  form).  
 
Although  some  adverse  events   will qualify  as unanticipated   problems  
involving  risks  to subjects  or others,  some  will not; and 
there  may be other  unanticipated  problems  that go beyond  
the definitions  of serious  and/or  unexpected  adverse  events.  
Examples  of unanticipated  problems  involving  risks  to 
subjects  or others  include:  
 
 Improperly  staging  a participant’s  tumor  resulting  in the participant  
being  assigned  to an incorrect  arm of the research  study;

 The theft of a research  computer  containing  confidential  subject  
information  (breach  of confidentiality);  and 
 The contamination  of a study  drug.  Unanticipated  problems  
generally  will warrant  consideration  of substantive  changes  in the 
research  protocol  or informed  consent  process/document  or other  
corrective  actions  in order  to protect  the safety,  welfare,  or rights  of 
subjects  or others.  
 
All anticipated  Grade  III or IV adverse  events  will be reported  to the IRB in the 
continuing  review  report  and/or  summary.  The study  teams  will monitor  accrual  
and toxicities  every  six months.  
 
 
7.2 Recording  Adverse  Events  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
All serious  adverse  events  will be recorded  in the source,  database  and/or  case 
report  form.  Adverse  events  unrelated  to the trial will not be recorded  unless  they 
are grade  III or above  (CTCAEv4).  Adverse  events  that are related  to the trial will 
be captured  in the source  document,  database  and/or  case report  form.  Adverse  
events  related  to the trial will be collected  until the time the study  completes.

8.1 Data  Collection  
Data  for this study  will be managed  by [CONTACT_696731][INVESTIGATOR_696703].  Data  collected  at   
baseline  and follow -up assessments  will be entered  by [CONTACT_696732].  The 
optical  scanning  program  has the capacity  for designer  specific  error  checks,  
flagged  at the time the questionnaires  are scanned.  After  data are scanned,  they 
are processed  and converted  into a SAS (Cary,  NC) format  where  a second  error  
check  is completed.  Data  from  neurocognitive  tests are double -entered           
into a separate  secure  Access  database  and compared  for accuracy.  All data 
mismatches  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_696733]  (when  applicable)  for resolution.  NIH 
Toolbox  data will be stored  on remote  computer  servers  and will be completely  
de-identified.  Data  from  the tDCS  mobile  units  and the cognitive  training  
(Lumosity)  will be downloaded  and processed  by [CONTACT_696734].

This study  is associated  with an Investigational  Device  Exemption  (IDE)  and 
will be monitored  by [CONTACT_6016]. Jude Clinical Research  Monitors  accordingly.  The 
monitors  will review  up to 15% of the study  participants  semi -annually  for 
appropriateness  of the informed  consent  process,  eligibility,  adverse  event  
recording  and participant’s  status.   Additional  information  may be monitored  at 
the request  of the Internal  Monitoring  Committee  (IMC),  the IRB,  or other  
institutional  administration.  
 
Source  document  verification  of eligibility  and informed  consent  for 100%  of 
St. Jude participants  will be performed  by [CONTACT_696735]  5 
working  days of completion  of enrollment.  The Clinical  Research  Monitor  will 
review  all SAE  reports  and other  applicable  essential  regulatory  documentation.  
The Monitor  will generate  a formal  report  which  is shared  with the Principal  
Investigator  (PI), study  team,  and the Internal  Monitoring  Committee  (IMC).  
 
8.3 Confidentiality  
Confidentiality  will be maintained.  Data forms  will be kept in locked  file 
cabinets,  in locked  offices,  accessed  only by [CONTACT_696736] “as needed”  
hierarchical  basis.  All electronic  files will stored  on a password  protected  
computer  and identifying  information  will be stored  in separate  electronic  files 
and linked  by [CONTACT_696737].  Data  files downloaded  for statistical  
analyses  will not contain  personal  identifiers.

In the first stage  we will recruit  [ADDRESS_945483]  that roughly 20% of the survivors  may not 
initiate  the trial after leaving  the institution  (i.e. may not provide  any 
information  at all for objective  1.1.1)  we anticipate  replacing  these  survivors  
and, thus,  a total of [ADDRESS_945484]  roughly  
97.7%  power  for objective  1.2.[ADDRESS_945485]  an improvement  of 0.65 in 
standardized  units,  respectively,  with type I error  =0.05.  
 
Analysis:  
 
Objective  1.1.1:  The feasibility of the 5-week tDCS  intervention  will be 
evaluated  using  Simon's  two stage  Minimax  design  with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_696712].  
 
Objective  1.2.1:  The improvement  in scores  on symbol  digit coding,  Stroop  
test, shifting  attention  test, digit span and verbal  fluency  from  baseline  to 5- 
week  follow  up will be done  using  matched  pair one sample  t-tests.  In addition,  
the improvement  in EF measures  over the 5 week  period  will also be evaluated  
using  longitudinal  methods  and implemented  using  PROC  MIXED  or PROC  
GEE  in SAS 9.3. 
 
Objective  1.2.2:  The improvement  in the scores  on the NIH Toolbox  Card  
Sort,  Flanker  and Working  Memory  tasks  between  tDCS  and sham,  will be 
done  using  matched  pair one sample  t-test. 
 
 
It will be important  to monitor  for AEs in both phases  of the study  as well.  
Thus,  in an “ad hoc”  manner  using  one sided  95% confidence  bounds  we will 
monitor  for all grade  3 or higher  adverse  events  (All types  of AE's  included)

Protocol Numbers  IRB # 818607 , UPCC #[ZIP_CODE], IND s #   
Phase  Phase 2a  
Methodology  Phase IIa  study to estimate the efficacy of a single infusion of autologous T 
cells expressing CD19 chimeric antig en receptors expressing tandem TCR ζ 
and 4 -1BB  (TCR ζ /4-1BB) costimulatory domains (referred to as “CART -
19” or “CTL019” cells) in non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) patients.  
Study Duration  The duration of active protocol intervention is approximately 24 months from 
screening visit. The proto col will require approximately 48 months to 
complete.  
Study Center(s)  Single -center  
Objectives  The primary objective is to estimate the efficacy of CART -19 cells in NHL 
patients by [CONTACT_834438] (ORR) in evaluable patients at 
3 mont hs. 
1. We will treat a total of 60 patients with either DLBCL, FL or MCL. 
(Cohort A, N=3 9 NHL treated with murine CART19; Cohort B, N=7 
T cell/histiocyte -rich DLBCL treated with murine CART19; Cohort 
C, N=14 DLBCL treated with humanized CART19). Since the re is 
no a priori suggestion that CART -19 cells would be more or less 
effective or safe for any histology, all patients in Cohort A will be 
analyzed together. A subset analysis according to histology will also 
be performed as a secondary objective. Cohorts  B and C will be 
analyzed individually to focus on ORR for patients with T 
cell/histiocyte -rich DLBCL and DLBCL subjects treated with 
huCART19, respectively.  
 
Secondary objectives are to:  
1. Determine persistence, trafficking and function of CART -[ADDRESS_1158718] 
CART -19 cells.  
5. Characteriz e the relative subsets of CART -19 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and 
Treg).  
6. Evaluate MRD using molecular technologies  
7. Describe survival and response rates.

based on binomial distribution. For secondary objectives, all adverse events 
will be described and exact 95% confidence intervals will be produced for 
adverse event rates, both overall and within maj or categories. Overall 
survival, progression -free survival, and duration of response will be analyzed 
using Kaplan -Meier curves and median survival time will be computed. To 
evaluate the persistence of CART -19 (or its subsets), the within -subject 
change in  the ratio of CART -19 cells (or subsets) between two pre -specified 
time points will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed -rank test, or to 
simultaneously analyze multiple times, linear mixed effects model 
methodology will be used.  All other secondary endpoi nts are measured as 
continuous variable and the effects of CART -[ADDRESS_1158721]. All the analyses will be 
two-sided and cut -off for statistical significance will be a P-value  <0.05. The 
number of patients enrolled versus the number of patients infused and 
proportion of subjects with manufacturing failure will be computed as a 
measure of feasibility.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background 
CD19 positive hematologic malignancies . B cell malignancies comprise a heterogeneous group 
of neoplasms including multiple non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), acute lymphoblastic 
leukemias (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL). An estimated 87,000 new cases of 
leukemia and NHL are diagnosed in the US annually1. This protocol will evaluate potential o f 
CART -19 cells to treat NHL, specifically diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular 
lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL),  which account for 31%, 22% and 6%, 
respectively, of the total NHL cases. As mentioned below, current treatments for these B cell 
malignancies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or autologous and allogeneic blood and 
bone marrow transplantation. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_708781], many patients remain 
incurable. Taken together, these data demonstrate that there is still a need to develop therapi[INVESTIGATOR_834403]. 
 
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: DLBCL has at least several subtypes, including but not limited 
to germinal center B cell (GCB) type, activated B-cell type (ABC) and primary mediastinal 
DLBCL2. The 3-year overall survival (OS) for GCB and ABC subsets of CLBCL in treated 
subjects is 84% and 56%, respectively3. Most DLBCL subjects are cured with conventional 
immunochemotherapy. However, for patients who relapse, while at least 60% of subjects remain 
sensitive to conventional treatment, < 10% have prolonged disease-free survival with second-line 
treatment conventional dose immunochemotherapy regimens4. Patients with relapsed or 
refractory (r/r) DLBCL are treated with chemotherapy (±rituximab) with the goal of subsequent 
high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (HSCT), for the subset of 
subjects with chemotherapy-sensitive disease.  Approximately 20-50% of responders to a second 
chem
otherapy regimen followed by [CONTACT_834440] [ADDRESS_1158722]-transplant, therapy is palliative.  Without transplant, chemotherapy provides 
short-term disease control in r/r DLBCL.  Primary refractory subjects are unlikely to achieve CR 
with a second chemotherapy regimen and following relapse, second remissions are usually not 
durable6.  
 
Follicular Lymphoma (FL): FL is the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 
comprises approximately 22% of all NHL cases7. The overall incidence of B-cell lymphoid 
neoplasms in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is estimated at 26.13/100,[ADDRESS_1158723] commonly used alkylating agent-based regimens include BR 
(bendamustine and rituximab), R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, 
and prednisone), or R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone)11.

 Response rates in excess of 85% are observed with many different combinations in the first-line 
setting12-15. In addition, when rituximab is used as maintenance treatment, both response rate and 
disease-free survival increase16-18. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_834404], high response 
rates, and long progression-free survival (PFS) with first line therapy, FL remains an incurable 
disease. Most patients treated will eventually relapse, and subsequent responses and durations of 
responses become increasingly shorter. Patients who become resistant to chemoimmunotherapy, 
clinically defined as relapsed or progressive within [ADDRESS_1158724] no good treatment 
options19,20. In these patients, toxicity commonly outweighs the benefit of treatment with 
chemotherapy20,21. Investigational agents (e.g., ofatumumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib) have 
been used with response rates of 10% to 27% and a median PFS of [ADDRESS_1158725] group of eligible patients, radioimmunotherapy achieves a long-term remission in <20%25. 
The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, and the PI3 kinase δ isoform inhibitor, idelalisib, 
are promising new agents under investigation in this setting and clinical trials are ongoing.  
 
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL): MCL is a less common, incurable subtype of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). It accounts for about 6% of all NHL cases in the Western world. At the 
molecular level, MCL is uniquely characterized by [CONTACT_834441] D1. This is due to the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which puts 
the cyclin D1 gene, also called the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (bcl-1) gene, under the control 
of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer with subsequent overexpression of cyclin D126-28. 
In association with overexpression of cyclin D1, cell surface markers such as CD20 and CD5 are 
also evident in MCL.  Current initial therapy for the treatment of MCL includes 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or hyperfractionated 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate 
and cytarabine (Hyper-CVAD), often in combination with rituximab (R-CHOP or R-Hyper 
CVAD); however, many other chemotherapeutic regimens have been evaluated. Younger 
patients with good performance status are frequently considered for more intensive induction 
therapy with combinations such as R-Hyper CVAD or alternating R-CHOP and rituximab, 
dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) followed by [CONTACT_834442] (SCT); however, this degree of intensive therapy is 
not an option for most patients with MCL because of their age and comorbidities29,30. Once MCL 
has relapsed after or failed to respond to initial treatment, the prognosis is poor. Following 
relapse, the median survival is around [ADDRESS_1158726] B cell lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma, ALL, 
CLL, hairy cell leukemia, and a subset of acute myelogenous leukemias32-34. CD19 is a 95kDa 
glycoprotein present on the B cell surface from early development until differentiation into 
plasma cells34-36. It is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and a component of a 
cell surface signal transduction complex that regulates signal transduction through the B cell 
receptor36-38. CD19 expression is restricted to B lineage cells and is not expressed by [CONTACT_834443]39. Anti-CD19 antibodies and scFvs, either 
native or conjugated to radioisotopes or toxins, are currently being developed and have 
demonstrated promise in both mouse models40-44 and human and non-human primates45-55.

 Because of this limited tissue expression profile, targeting CD19 is also favorable due to a 
reduced on-target, off-organ activity toxicity profile.  
 
Engineered T cells with redirected specificity: chimeric 
antigen receptors (CARs). As shown in Figure 2, the CAR 
approach uses genetically programmed, patient-derived 
lymphocytes transfected with chimeric receptor genes to 
combine the effector functions of T lymphocytes with the 
ability of antibodies to recognize predefined surface 
antigens with high specificity in a non-MHC restricted 
manner56,57. These receptors have the ability to recognize 
intact membrane proteins independent of antigen 
processing. CARs or T-bodies typi[INVESTIGATOR_834405] T cell 
activation (reviewed in58,59). In principle, universal targeting vectors can be constructed because 
the scFv bind to native cell surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_732398]. 
The tumor binding function of CAR is usually accomplished by [CONTACT_1116] a single chain 
variable fragment (scFv) antibody, containing the V H and V L chains joined by a peptide linker of 
about [ADDRESS_1158727] generation CARs contain further 
advancements such as triple costimulatory modules comprised of CD28, 41-BB, and TCR ζ. See 
reviews of CARs for details61-63. There are several potential limitations to the CAR T cells: 1) the 
tumor must express the target antigen on the cell surface; 2) large amounts of shed or soluble 
antigen could inhibit the CAR T cells; 3) the chimeric receptor may be immunogenic, resulting 
in the elimination of the redirected T cells by [CONTACT_167294].  
1.2 Investigational Agent 
The investigational agent in this protocol is CART-19 cells (also known as CTL019 cells).  
Autologous T cells will be engineered using a lentiviral vector to express an extracellular single 
chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for CD19. This will be expected to redirect specificity of 
the transduced T cells for cells that express CD19, a molecule that is restricted in expression on 
the surface of the malignant cells and on normal B cells. In addition to the CD19 scFv, the cells 
will be transduced to express an intracellular tandem signaling domain comprised of 4-1BB and 
TCRζ signaling modules. Clinical grade CD19 TCR ζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector will be 
manufactured by [CONTACT_834444], the Indiana 
Univer
sity Vector Production Facility,  The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834406] , or equivalent 
lentiviral vector production facility. The extracellular single chain antibody (scFv) with 
specificity for CD19 was previously reported64. The scFv used will either be derived from a 
mouse monoclonal antibody using hybridoma cell line FMC63 described in Nicholson et al. or a 
humanized version of that sequence developed by [CONTACT_834445]. 
The signaling domains are entirely of the native human sequences65,66. 
 
The CART-[ADDRESS_1158728] of the infusion of 
1-5 x 108 CART-19 cells. Each bag will contain an aliquot (volume dependent upon dose) of 
cry
omedia containing the following infusible grade reagents (% v/v): 31.25% plasmalyte-A, 
31.25% dextrose (5%), 0.45% NaCl, 7.5% DMSO, 1% dextran 40, 5% human serum albumin.  
 
Drug interactions. CART-19 cells are expected to retain many of the properties of natural T cells. 
As such, they will be expected to be susceptible to immunosuppressive agents such as 
corticosteroids, immunophilins such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, methotrexate, 
mycophenolate mofetil, mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ontak. 
Lymphocytes are especially susceptible to cytotoxic and chemotherapeutic agents that are 
commonly administered for hematologic malignancies such as cyclophosphamide and 
fludarabine. 
 
Immune elimination. An important consideration is that the CAR can be immunogenic, either 
because foreign sequences such as antibiotic selection genes or mouse antibody sequences are 
expressed, or because of novel epi[INVESTIGATOR_834407]. Immunogenicity of the CAR can lead to the rejection 
of the adoptively transferred T cells. The basis for this supposition is that human retrovirally-
modified CTLs expressing a fusion protein consisting of hygromycin:HSV thymidine kinase 
were eliminated by [CONTACT_729307]67; importantly, this 
immune mediated elimination was not accompanied by [CONTACT_729308] [ADDRESS_1158729] as “cytokine sinks” , enhancing the availability of 
cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-1571. This hypothesis has been tested clinically in patients with 
metastatic melanoma refractory of conventional treatments72. The patients received a 
lymphodepleting conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60mg/kg x 2 days) and 
fludarabine (25 mg/m2 x 5 days) prior to adoptive transfer of T cells. We have treated patients 
with myeloma, NHL, and CLL with infusions of ex-vivo co-stimulated and expanded autologous 
T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and observed improved engraftment73-76. In this 
protocol we propose to transfer CART-[ADDRESS_1158730] conditioning is more than simply “making room” because the 
quantitative recovery of adoptively transferred T cells in mice reveals that in vivo proliferation 
following adoptive transfer is identical in mice with or without previous irradiation. 
1.[ADDRESS_1158731] significant SAE seen in adult and pediatric patients treated with CART-19 has been on 
target CRS.  CRS is described in details below (section 1.5.2) but typi[INVESTIGATOR_834408] [ADDRESS_1158732] ed by [CONTACT_834446], 
cytopenias, elevated ferritin, altered mental status, and other complications. 
 
CRS/MAS was managed in 1 patient initially with corticosteroids.  Subsequently, as more data 
became available, it has been successfully managed with supportive care and when needed, 
tocilizumab therapy.  Tocilizumab is an anti-IL6 receptor antibody, and has been administered at 
a single dose of 4 to 8 mg/kg. This may be preferable to systemic immunosuppression with 
corticosteroids. In many cases, the CRS has been severe but reversible. However there have been 
three cases of refractory CRS that resulted in death on UPCC21413.  It is hypothesized this may 
be related to tumor burden, so that treating patients with less tumor burden may result in less 
severe cytokine release syndrome. However, additional contributory patient and CART-19 
related factors cannot be ruled out. 
 
Since CRS mechanistically is a required part of the antitumor mechanism of in vivo  CART -19  
cell expansion and tumor killing, tocilizumab was administered for CRS with worsening 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], including pulmonary infiltrates, increasing oxygen requirement  including 
high-flow oxygen  and/or need for mechanical ventilation or hemodynamic instability despi[INVESTIGATOR_834409]. Steroids 
following CART-19 infusion were avoided and given only under life threatening situations due 
to the known lymphocytic effects.  
1.5
 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
We have chosen to use flat dosing via the intravenous route of administration for this protocol. 
The dose that we have selected for administration is 1-5x108 CART -1 9 cells. This is the “high 
dose” from our randomized CART -19 dose-finding protocol (UPCC03712) as described in 
Section 1.5.1 (Dose Rationale).

eff
ective in patients with CLL in UPCC04409 and ALL patients in CHP959.

 We are currently performing a randomized dose finding study for patients with CLL 
(UPCC03712) comparing responses with 1-5 x 107 and 1-5 x 108 CART -19 cells.  If new 
information regarding an optimal dose level and corresponding clinical response were to become 
available, then this trial will be appropriately modified.   
 
Manufacturing of this target dose is deemed achievable for the majority of patients based on our 
published data for manufactured CD3+/CD28+ costimulated and expanded T cells from patients 
with non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma . Fifteen of the sixteen patients for which T cell products were 
manufactured had DLBCL94. In the event that manufacturing feasibility is not met for a 
particular patient, we will request approval from the FDA to proceed with infusion. These 
patients will be included in the safety evaluable population only. We will continue to accumulate 
data in this regard regarding the relationship of cell dose to toxicity and response.   
1.5.2 Risk/Benefits 
Potential Risks: 
Participation in this study will expose the patient to genetically engineered autologous T cells. 
The risk of the cells alone is low based on clinical experience. The unknown risk is that of the 
signaling domains in the CAR. T cell proliferation could be uncontrolled; however, we have not 
observed this in our pre-clinical models or in any CART-19 treated patients thus far. In this case, 
corticosteroids and chemotherapy would be given to eradicate the CAR cells; this has worked in 
previous cases95.  
 
Immunogenicity. Another risk is that the cells may be immunogenic, and that the patients will 
have an immune response directed against the scFv or novel sequences generated by [CONTACT_834447]; this has not had clinical consequences in previous trials studying lentivirus transduced  
T cells. If an immune response to the cells occurs, it is possible that the cells will be rejected. 
Three
 of 3 patients in an anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) CAR trial developed Human Anti-
Murine Antibody (HAM A) 
and loss of T cell engraftment96. This has gen erally not been an 
issue in patients treated with CARs directed towards B cells as temporary or persistent B 
cell aplasia results in reduced antibody formation.  
 
Hypogammaglobulinemia. Persistent B cell aplasia leads to hypogammaglobulinemia and may 
increase the risk of infection. This can be managed with IVIG repletion. In the UPenn and CHOP 
CART19 trials, hypogammaglobulinemic CLL and ALL patients have received IVIG. No 
significant unusual infection patterns have been identified in patients receiving IVIG repletion at 
regular intervals. 
 
Transformation. There is a risk that people who receive gene transfer may develop new tumors 
derived from their genetically modified cells. This risk is primarily associated with viral gene 
transfer vectors that integrate into the cellular DNA where they may dysregulate genes 
controlling proliferation. Transformation has not been observed following adoptive T cell 
transfer in hundreds of cancer and HIV patients receiving gammaretroviral modified T cells 
treated on multiple protocols at many academic centers97, and in the [ADDRESS_1158734] treated >[ADDRESS_1158735] received a single i.v. infusion of 1x1010 lentiviral modified T cells; in the second 
protocol, each subject received up to [ADDRESS_1158736] found this to be well 
tolerated73,94,99- 101.  
  
Infusion reactions. Immediately following T cell infusions, reactions could occur and may 
include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea. Patients must be pre-medicated with acetaminophen 
and anti-histamine prior to the infusion of CART19. A review of infusion-related adverse events 
of 381 T cell products administered to 180 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], enrolled on 18 studies, over a 10 year 
period was conducted by [CONTACT_834448].94 and found no grade 3-4 infusion reactions during initial 
monitoring or 24-hour follow-up. Grade 1-2 adverse events were observed in 21 patients during 
or 
shortly after infusion and included nausea, vomiting, fever, and/or chills. A mild infusion 
reaction was recorded in one of more than [ADDRESS_1158737] been two events of intracranial 
hemorrhage on CART19 trials under IND# .  One event occurred on UPCC#[ZIP_CODE] (adult 
AL
L) in the setting of thrombocytopenia (related to prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy and 
underlying leukemia), was determined to be possibly related to the CART19 cell infusion, 
occurred with concurrent Grade 4 CRS, and resulted in death. Another event occurred on the 
CNS3 cohort on CHP959 (pediatric ALL) in the setting of active circulating leukemia, CRS, 
sepsis/bacteremia, and acute renal failure requiring dialysis. The subject died, and intracranial 
hemorrhage (suspected clinically, unconfirmed radiologically) was felt to be the immediate cause 
of death in this critically ill patient.  A third event occurred on 16CT022 (pediatric ALL study) in 
February 2017.  A 3-year-old subject with refractory ALL and CNS2 disease experienced severe 
CRS complicated by [CONTACT_834449]-organ failure.  While on extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation, the subject experienced an intracranial hemorrhage, with associated cerebral edema 
as a t
erminal event. 
 
Cytokine Release Syndrome.  
 
Overview and Clinical Manifestations: Patients treated with CART-19 may experience a 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which has correlated with disease response.    Clinical 
manifestations have included   high fevers, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, 
hypotension (occasionally requiring pressor support)  tachypnea, hypoxia (occasionally requiring 
ventilator support), altered mental status including delirium and confusion (in several patients), 
word finding difficulties, evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation,  as well as 
macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Additional symptoms of CRS may also include rigors, 
sweating, dyspnea, and seizures.     In some cases CRS, TLS and hypotension have led to acute 
kidney injury and several patients have required at least transient dialysis.   The CRS has been 
effectively abrogated with anti-cytokine directed therapy including tocilizumab in most patients . 
As of July 2014, three patients on another CART-[ADDRESS_1158738] been observed in patients treated with CART 19, 
coincident with clinical manifestations of the CRS. MAS appears to be a reaction to immune 
activation that occurs from the CRS, and therefore should be considered a manifestation of CRS.  
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is similar to Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
(HLH); it is a reaction to immune stimulation by [CONTACT_80601], autoimmune diseases or other 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_32895], but is distinguished from familial or genetically mediated HLH.  There are no 
definitive diagnostic criteria for MAS, but it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_834410]. 
 
Some but not all features of MAS are typi[INVESTIGATOR_218206].  The clinical syndrome of MAS is 
characterized by [CONTACT_834450]-remitting fever, cytopenias affecting at least two of three 
lineages, and hepatosplenomegaly.  It is associated with biochemical abnormalities, such as high 
circulating levels of serum ferritin, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25), and triglycerides, 
together with a decrease of circulating NK activity.  Other findings include variable levels of 
transaminases up to signs of acute liver failure and coagulopathy with findings consistent with 
DIC. A pathologic feature of MAS is the presence of hemophagocytic CD163+ macrophages 
(HPC) in bone marrow or lymph-node aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]. 
 
Diagnosis is based on the fulfillment of criteria established in 2004102 for HLH associated with 
autosomal recessive disorders (familial HLH, fHLH).  
 
A diagnosis of non-familial HLH/MAS is made by [CONTACT_7661] 5/8 criteria: 
 Fever  
 Splenom egaly 
 Cytopenia s (affecting 2 or more lineages in the peripheral blood; hemoglobin <9 g/dL, 
platelets <100,000/ L, Absolute neutrophil count <1000/ L) 
 Fast ing triglycerides >265 mg/dL, Fibrinogen   < 1.5 g/L 
 He mophagocytosis in bone marrow or spleen or lymph nodes  
 Low  or absent NK-cell activity 
 Ferr itin  > 500 g/L 
 Solubl e CD25R > 2400 U/L 
 
Supportive clinical criteria include neurologic symptoms and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid pleocytosis, 
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and transaminitis, hypoalbuminemia and hyponatremia. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], high fevers, cytopenias, and when performed, hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow 
is observed (though marrow specimens at the time of the reaction are not often taken). Soluble 
CD25R and NK cell activity are not standard tests, though samples are taken for retrospective 
CD25R analysis.  Therefore, patients may not meet strict definition of HLH/MAS, but given the 
constellation of findings, and the consistent dramatic elevation in Ferritin, this is indeed the 
reaction associated with the CRS.   
 
At this time it is still unknown whether CRS/MAS is beneficial or harmful to the antitumor 
response.  Research monitoring data showed that IL6 levels were extraordinarily high during the 
CRS, prompting us to use an anti-IL6 receptor antibody tocilizumab to treat the CRS/MAS.  The 
majority of patients treated with tocilizumab for CRS and MAS had rapid (within hours) 
resolution of dramatic fevers, and continuous improvement in hypotension and hypoxia over 
hours to several days, and showed improvement in biochemical evidence of CRS and MAS

 within 48 hours.  Adult patients were treated with tocilizumab 4mg/kg or 8mg/kg.  It is unclear if 
early treatment will negate the antitumor response.  Treatment and timing of treatment of this 
toxicity will be at the discretion of the patient’s physician and the study investigator, and occur 
in the setting of hemodynamic instability.  
 
Pediatric ALL patients treated with CART-[ADDRESS_1158739] experienced a similar CRS and 
MAS. CHP959-100 experienced a severe CRS and had high fevers, hypotension, acute vascular 
leak syndrome and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]. The patient was treated with etanercept and 
tocilizumab, as described in Grupp et al., NEJM, 2013 , and all associated adverse events 
resolved. CHP959-104 and CHP959-105 received the 10% dose only and experienced CRS. 
CHP959-103 received the 10% and 30% doses, respectively, and experienced a mild CRS after 
the 10% dose, with no CRS experienced after the 30% dose. None of these patients experienced 
severe enough CRS (i.e. there were no instances of more than transient oxygen requirements, or 
hypotension requiring pressor support) to require treatment with steroids or cytokine blockade.  
 
Grading of CRS: The CTC grading system was originally developed to capture a cytokine 
syndrome occurring during infusional therapy; therefore, it is inadequate to capture the delayed 
CRS that occurs after CART19 infusion.  We propose to modify the CTC grading specifically to 
capture toxicity for protocols using CART-19 cells. MAS/HLH observed signs and symptoms 
are a manifestation of CRS and will therefore not be graded separately (See Table 8-1 in Section 
8.1).

Clonality and insertional oncogenesis . The  occurren ce  o f  adverse  events  caused  by 
[CONTACT_834451]  a  gene  therapy  trial  fo r  X-linked  SCI D 
following stem cell therapy  emph asizes the potential for problems in translating thi s approa ch to 
the clinic95-98. The T cell leukemias were attributable to clonal expansion conferred by 
[CONTACT_834452]34+ bone marrow stem cell modification98. 
This represents the most severe adverse event caused by [CONTACT_708895]. However, there is 
also evidence for retroviral vector integration site dominance in a gene therapy trial of 
ß-thalassaemia without malignancy99. The lentiviral vector used for CART19 manufacturing is 
par
t of a vector class that may have a lower risk for integration in or near oncogenic regions than 
oncoretroviral vectors100. 
 
Uncontrolled T cell proliferatio n. CART19 cells could proliferate without control of normal 
homeostatic mechanisms. In pre-clinical studies, CART19 cells have only proliferated in 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1158741] disease (GVHD). The chance of GVHD occurring is low, but it is a potential 
risk with CART19 therapy if administered after prior allogeneic transplantation.  A prior 
UPenn/CHOP study of activated DLI ( ex vivo activated cells collected from the donor and grown 
in the same fashion as CART19 but without CAR introduction) did not show high rates of 
GVHD (2/18 patients with grade 3 GVHD and none with Grade 4)102.  
 
Patients with active, acute or chronic GVHD requiring systemic therapy are excluded from 
enrolling in this study.  However, due to the possibility of some degree of residual donor 
engraftment, which will include T cells of donor origin, patients that received a previous HSCT 
at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834411].  To date, no 
patient that had a prior allogeneic HSCT developed GVHD after autologous CART19 
infusion61,87,88 even when “autologous” cell included cells of donor origin94.  
 
B cell aplasia. B cell aplasia has been seen in CART19-treated subjects as well as B cell recovery 
in some subjects who had lost CART1988103103103102[102]102(Maude et al., 2014). Persistent B cell 
aplasia leads to hypogammaglobulinemia and may increase the risk of infection. This is common 
with anti-CD20 directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]103. This can be managed with IVIG repletion by [CONTACT_834453]. In previous CART19 trials, responding CLL and 
ALL patients who are hypogammaglobulinemic have received IVIG.  No significant unusual 
infection patterns have been identified. 
 
Fatal SAEs with CARs:  Two studies have reported fatal SAEs following CAR infusion in pa-
tients with malignancy.  Brentjens et al designed a retrovirally-transduced CAR against the 
CD19 molecule for patients with B cell lymphoma. The CD19  CAR was the second generation 
design containing CD28 and CD3ζ signaling domains. A total of [ADDRESS_1158742] received pre-T cell condi-
tioning with 1.5g/m2 of cyclophosphamide followed 2 days later by [CONTACT_834454]19 CAR T cells at 1.2-3x107 cells/kg. Twenty hours following T cell infusion, the 
patient developed persistent fever (transient fever was observed in the first 3 subjects on the 
study too) and hypotension that was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_834412] x-ray, hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], and acute renal failure. The family decided to remove 
further life sustaining therapi[INVESTIGATOR_834413] 44h post-T cell infusion. The post-
mortem pathology report failed to support a diagnosis of tumor lysis syndrome as the primary 
source of renal failure. Analysis of serum cytokines revealed elevated levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, 
and IL-[ADDRESS_1158743] likely 
cause of death and attributed the etiology of the death as “possibly related” to CAR T cell infu-
sion104.  
 
The second case of a fatal SAE related to CAR T cells was reported by [CONTACT_834455] (Morgan 
et al. 2010). This study attempted to treat cancer patients with overexpressing ERBB2 tumors 
with an anti- ERBB2 CAR of 3rd generation (containing CD28, 41BB and CD3ζ signaling do-
mains). The first subject in the study was a 39-year-old female with colon cancer metastatic to 
lungs and liver. The patient received lymphodepleting regimen (60mg/kg cyclophosphamide dai-
ly 
for 2 days followed by [CONTACT_453918] 25mg/m2 for the next 5 days) followed the next day by [CONTACT_834456]-
rovirally-transduced 1010 ERBB2 CAR T cell (transduction efficiency 79%). At 15min post-
infusion, the patient began to develop dyspnea and hypoxia with pulmonary infiltrates on chest 
X-ray. The patient progressed into hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_834414]-
ry support, vasopressor-dependent hypotension, and cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient was ini-
tially resuscitated and started on high dose steroids, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_834415], the 
patient expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] 5 days after infusion. Serum cytokine measurements demonstrated a dramatic rise 
in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, GM-CSF) within [ADDRESS_1158744] six adult ALL subjects 
infused on UPCC21413 died as a result of refractory Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in the 
set
ting of intercurrent infections. Thereafter, the single dose administered in UPCC21413 was 
reduced to 1-5x107 CART19 cells. In the next six adult ALL subjects treated at the de-escalated 
dose, two died from an intracranial bleed and sepsis, respectively.   
 
Risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) related to cytoreductive chemotherapy or CAR T cells.  The 
risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is dependent on the disease and burden of disease. Several of 
the patients treated with CART19 on this protocol have in fact developed tumor lysis syndrome. 
Therefore, all patients will be closely monitored both before and after chemotherapy and CART-
19 infusions including blood tests for potassium and uric acid.  All patient-subjects will receive 
allopurinol prophylactically. TLS resulting in renal insufficiency, or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_732402], or 
evidence of organ dysfunction will be managed with intravenous fluids and rasburicase as 
needed and determined by [CONTACT_172276]. Appropriate clinical therapy will be 
administered should any significant tumor lysis occur.  
  
Unknowns : At this time there are still several unknowns regarding the observed CRS after 
CART19 infusion. It is unknown which patient factors (including type of disease; disease 
burden; prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; genetic predisposition) correlate with severity of CRS.  It is also 
unknown if cell dose correlates with severity of clinical CRS and if the duration and intensity of 
the CRS correlates with disease response.  It is evident that responding patients have had CRS, it

 remains unknown if abrogating the CRS with anti-cytokine directed therapy abrogates anti-tumor 
responses.  
 
Potential benefits:   
Based on inclusion criteria and published literature107,108, eligible patients will have a median 
anticipated survival of <[ADDRESS_1158745].  The risks associated with allogeneic 
are high and include a minimum 20% treatment-related mortality (TRM); in many cases TRM 
would be even higher, and many of these patients would not be eligible for allogeneic SCT.  At 
best, RIC allogeneic SCT results in a 50% [ADDRESS_1158746]; as demonstrated in our preliminary data for patients with advanced 
CLL, including 8/[ADDRESS_1158747] 
follow up, CR has persisted beyond 2 ½ years.   Therefore, we believe the risk:benefit ratio for 
this study is quite favorable. 
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary objective:   
1. To esti mate the efficacy of a single target dose of 1-5 x108 CART - 19 cells for patients 
with advanced B cell non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  
a. Describe overall response rate for patients with NHL.  We will treat a total of 60 
pati
ents with either DLBCL, FL or MCL. (Cohort A, N=39 NHL treated with 
m
urine CART19; Cohort B, N=7 T
 cell/histiocyte-rich DLBCL treated with 
m
urine CART19; Cohort C, N=14 DLBCL treated with humanized CART19). 
Since t
here is no a priori suggestion that CART-19 cells would be more or less 
effective or safe for any histology, all patients in Cohort A will be analyzed 
toget
her. A subset analysis according to histology will also be performed as a 
secondary objective. Cohorts B and C will be analyzed individually to focus on 
OR
R for patients with T cell/histiocyte-rich DLBCL and DLBCL subjects treated 
with huCART19, respectively. 
 
Secondary objectives: 
1. Deter mine persistence, trafficking and function of CART-[ADDRESS_1158748] CART -19 cells.  
5. Characterize the relative subsets of CART-19 T cells  (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).  
6. Evaluate MRD using molecular technologies 
7. Descri be survival and response rates. 
a. Describe overall response rate (ORR) for each individual histology with either 
m
urine CART19 or humanized CART19, as well as CR, CRu and PR rates. 
b. Descri be overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients 
c. Describe duration of response (DOR) for responding patients 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1158749] common NHL histologies (DLBCL, MCL, FL) are treated and describe activity 
according to histology. The initial study design included at least [ADDRESS_1158750]-serve basis. These 30 NHL subjects will all receive murine CART19 and will be 
known as Cohort A
 (V5.03-05-15). 
  
A
s of protocol Version 5.03-05-15, two additional cohorts are also added: (1) Cohort B; N=7 T-
cel
l/histiocyte rich DLBCL treated with murine CART19; and, (2) Cohort C; N=[ADDRESS_1158751] 
[ZIP_CODE]
-09 with humanized CART19, included in Cohort A per prior protocol version.  
 
As 
of protocol Version 7.10-17-2016, Cohort A was further expanded to allow for 6 additional 
DL
BCL subjects to be enrolled.  Therefore, a total of 57 evaluable subjects will be enrolled on 
this protocol across all three Cohorts.   
 
As of protocol Version 8.08-07-2017, three additional enrollment slots were added to further 
expand 
Cohort A. A maximum of 60 evaluable subjects will now be enrolled across the three 
cohor
ts as follows: 
 Cohort A:  Will include a total of 39 evaluable subjects; with a minimum of 20 DLBCL 
subjects and a minimum of  16 total subjects with either FL or MCL histologies (enrolled 
on a first-come, first-serve basis). All subjects in Cohort A will receive murine CART19.  
 Cohort B : Will include 7 evaluable DLBCL subjects with T-cell rich disease.  All 
subjects in Cohort B will receive murine CART19. 
 Cohort C : Will include [ADDRESS_1158752] adequate T cells will be leukapheresed to obtain large 
numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART-19 manufacturing. The T 
cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with TCR ζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector, expanded 
in vitro and then frozen for future administration after passing all release tests.  
 
Unless contraindicated and medically not advisable based on previous chemotherapy, patients 
will be given conditioning chemotherapy prior CART-[ADDRESS_1158753] received CART-19 cells at the protocol-specified dose (1-
5x108 CART-19 cells). These patients will be evaluable for primary efficacy endpoints.  
 
Subjec
ts with a manufactured cell dose that is less than the protocol-specified dose will be scored 
as a manufacturing failure. These subjects will receive their cell infusion, provided that the 
manufactured dose is above the CVPF minimum acceptable dose for infusion (2x107 CART -19 
cells) and all other manufacturing release criteria are met. The subjects that are infused with 
≥2x107-≤1x108 CART -19 cells are primary efficacy non-evaluable patients. They will not be 
included in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. However, they will be included for secondary 
efficacy, safety, manufacturing, correlative and exploratory endpoint analyses. 
 
F
or the purposes of the study, primary efficacy non-evaluable patients will be replaced with 
primary efficacy evaluable patients. Both primary efficacy evaluable and non-evaluable patients 
will
 be followed in the same manner according to the Schedule of Study Procedures for all 
evaluations, including clinical, research (correlative) and safety. 
 
All patients receiving >2x107 CART -19 will be assessed for clinical response according to the 
criteria discussed in Sections 6.11 and 6.12.  Again, patients scored as manufacturing failures 
and receiving ≥2x107-<1x108 CART -19 cells (e.g. the primary efficacy non-evaluable patients) 
will not be included in primary efficacy endpoint analysis (see Section 7). Table 3-[ADDRESS_1158754] blood tests to assess safety, engraftment and persistence of the CART-19 
cells at regular intervals as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures (Section 15.1).

those patients achieving complete response (CR), complete response unconfirmed (CRu) and 
par
tial response (PR) according to the Tumor Response Assessment defined in Section 6.11. 
3.4 Secondary Study Endpoints 
Secondar
y endpoints include laboratory measures to evaluate: 
 
1. Engraftm ent, persistence and trafficking to tumor sites:  These analyses will be performed 
using Q-PCR assays.  The duration of in vivo survival of CART-19 cells is defined as 
“engraftment”. The primary engraftment endpoint is the # DNA vector genomic copi[INVESTIGATOR_834416]-[ADDRESS_1158756] the murine anti-CD19 or other elements of 
the transgene or vector such as VSV-G, and assess correlation with loss of detectable 
CART -19 (loss of engraftment).  These analyses will be performed using multiparametric 
flow cytometry. 
 
5. Determine phenotypic and functional evolution of CART -[ADDRESS_1158757]-treatment using quantitative 
molecular approaches. 
 
Secondary safety and feasibility endpoints include: 
1. Occurrence of study related adverse events, defined as NCI CTC > grade 3 
signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities and clinical events that are possible, likely or 
definitely related to study treatment at any time from the infusion until week 24. this will 
include infusional toxicity, and any toxicity possibly related to the CART-19 cells 
including but not limited to: 
a. Fevers 
b. Rash

(PR), complete response unconfirmed (CRu), or complete response (CR) will be 
determined.  Response determination will be only “descriptive” given the small 
number of subjects to be treated. Exploratory analyses of available CT, MRI, 
and/or PET imaging datasets may also be performed (e.g., to assess whether there 
are imaging biomarkers that are obtainable from pretreatment scans to predict 
response to therapy).

followed for toxicity, immune reactions, and any long-term adverse events.  Therefore, subjects 
will continue to be followed for: 1) engraftment as long as patients are at risk (until evidence of 
loss of detectable transduced T cells), 2) DFS until there is disease progression or they begin a 
new cancer
 therapy, and 3) survival until the time of death; or until the patient withdraws consent 
for 
clinical data collection, enrolls into a 15 year long-term follow-up protocol, or the end of the 
study (Last Subject/Last Visit).   
 
Subjec
ts who complete the [ADDRESS_1158769]’s primary care physician and/or local oncologist 
will be asked to provide information from the subject’s medical record to the study team at 
protocol defined ti me points (including the results of any routine care examinations and/or 
laboratory assessments), and assist in the collection of protocol required blood samples (if 
applicable) which will be sent to the University of Pennsylvania for protocol required analysis.  
The subject and local provider will also be contact[CONTACT_217702] a member of the study 
team to assess any potential toxicity.

single chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an intracellular signaling 
molecule consisting of a tandem signaling domains comprised of the TCR  signaling module 
linked to the 4-1BB costimulatory domain. The CART-19 cells are cryopreserved in infusible 
cryomedia and will be administered as a single infusion.  Each bag will contain an aliquot 
(volume dependent upon dose) of cryomedia containing the following infusible grade reagents 
(% v/v): 31.25% plasmalyte-A, 31.25% dextrose (5%), 0.45% NaCl, up to 7.5% DMSO, 1% 
dextran 40, 5% human serum albumin.  
 
Expected toxicities associated with infusion of CART-19 cells include transient fever, chills 
nausea, and rigors.  In order to minimize these events, patients will receive premedication as 
instructed below in Section 5.4.  Toxicities that could potentially occur but are unprecedented are 
primarily related to the gene transfer and are described in Section 8.4.2.  These include

 a. Pulmonary: Requirement for supplemental oxygen to keep saturation greater than 
95% or presence of radiographic abnormalities on chest x-ray that are progressive 
b. Cardi ac: New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management 
c. Hypotension requiring pressor support 
d. Active Infection: Positive blood cultures for bacteria, fungus, or virus. 
5.3 Treatment Regimen 
A single dose of CART-19 transduced T cells will be administered by i.v. infusion consisting of 
1-5 x 108 cells transduced with the CD19 TCR ζ/4-1BB vector.  The infusion will be scheduled to 
occur approximately 1 to 4 days following chemotherapy. Cohorts A and B will receive murine 
CART19 and Cohort C will receive humanized CART19.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
Cell manufacturing is done according to Figure 3 under INDs . The CART-19 T 
cells are prepared in the CVPF and are not released from the CVPF until FDA approved release 
criteria for the infused cells (e.g., cell dose, cell purity, sterility, average copy number of 
vectors/cell, etc.) are met. Upon release, the cells are taken to the bedside for administration.  
 
Package and Labeling 
Each bag will contain an aliquot (volume dependent upon dose) of cryomedia containing the 
following infusible grade reagents (% v/v): 31.25% plasmalyte-A, 31.25% dextrose (5%), 0.45% 
NaCl, up to 7.5% DMSO, 1% dextran 40, 5% human serum albumin. 
 
Each infusion bag will be affixed with a label containing information regarding the dose, the 
method of manipulation, the vector and the following statements “FOR AUTOLOGOUS USE 
ONLY” And “Caution: New Drug- Limited by [CONTACT_12201]”.  In addition 
the label will have at least two unique identifiers. Prior to each infusion, two individuals will 
independently verify all unique identifier information in the presence of the patient and to 
confirm that the information is correctly matched to the patient. 
 
Cell thawing   
The frozen cells will be transported in dry ice to the subject’s bedside at the CTRC or Rhoads (or 
elsewhere at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71971]) .  The cells will be thawed at the 
bedside using a water bath maintained at 36 C to 38C.  The bag will be gently massaged until 
the cells have just thawed.  There should be no frozen clumps left in the container at the time of 
infusion. If the CART-[ADDRESS_1158775] a damaged or leaking bag, or otherwise 
appear
s to be compromised, it should not be infused, and should be returned to the CVPF as 
specified below.  
 
Premedication 
Side effects following T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea. It is 
recommended that the subject be pre-medicated with 650mg acetaminophen and 25-50mg 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride prior to the infusion of CART-[ADDRESS_1158776] fever not relieved by [CONTACT_58086]. It is 
recommended that patients not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone,

case of a life-threatening emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on T cells.  
 
Febrile reaction 
In the event of febrile reaction, an evaluation for infection should be initiated, and patients 
managed appropriately with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care as medically indicated 
and determined by [CONTACT_1963]. In the unlikely event that the subject develops sepsis or 
systemic bacteremia following CAR T cell infusion, appropriate cultures and medical 
management should be initiated. If a contaminated CART-[ADDRESS_1158777] . The duration of the infusion will be based on the total volume to 
be infused and the recommended infusion rate.   
 
Emergency medical equipment (i.e., emergency trolley) will be available during the infusion in 
case the subject has an allergic response, or severe hypotensive crisis, or any other reaction to th e 
infusion. Vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation 
by [CONTACT_406]) will be measured within 10 minutes prior to the infusion and within 15 
minutes after the infusion.  Thereafter, vital signs will be measured at 30 (+/- 5) minutes, 45 (+/- 
5) minutes, and 60 (+/- 5) minutes after the infusion, and then every hour (+/- 10 minutes) for the 
next 
[ADDRESS_1158778]’s vital signs are not 
satisfactory and stabl e three hours post- CART -[ADDRESS_1158779] will be 
discharged after the physician managing their care on the day of the infusion has determined that 
they are in satisfactory condition. 
 
Return or Destruction of Study Drug 
CART -19 cells may need to be returned to the CVPF for a variety of reasons, including but not 
limited to: 1) Mislabeled product; 2) Condition of patient prohibits infusion/injection, and 3) 
Subject refuses infusion. Any unused product will be returned to CVPF by [CONTACT_834463]. 
 
There is an ongoing reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug remaining per-
formed by [CONTACT_145149]. Final disposition of the investigational product will also be documented in 
the site Investigational Product Accountability logs appropriately.

 GM- CSF should be avoided due to potential to worsen CRS symptoms.  G-CSF 
would be the preferred 
myeloid growth factor over GM-CSF, if medically indicated. 
The effects of G-CSF are unknown and can be used at the physician’s discretion. 
 Ster oids or other immunosuppressant drugs should NOT be used within 10 days prior 
to the apheresis procedure. 
 Ster oids or other immunosuppressant drugs should NOT be used within 24 hours pri-
or t

Documents required: 
 Complete Enrollment Form  
 Copy of signed patient consent and HIPAA form 
 Source documentation to confirm enrollment/eligibility 
 
Upon receipt of screening and eligibility documentation, the Sponsor Monitor will review and 
provide documentation that the monitoring visit for eligibility has been completed.  This 
documentation must be received prior to cell product manufacturing.   
6.[ADDRESS_1158784] acceptance to initiate processing for clinical 
manufacturing to meet the dosing requirements includes the following specifications : A 
CBC with automated differential on the apheresis product following completion of collection 
that reports absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 500/uL. If the ALC <500/uL in the apheresis 
product, it is recommended that the CD3 cell count should be ≥ 150/u L for acceptance to begin 
processing for clinical manufacturing to achieve the target dose. 
 
Historical Apheresis Sample 
Cryopreserved historical apheresis products collected from the patient prior to study entry are 
usable for CART-[ADDRESS_1158785] meets adequate mononuclear cell yields. The 12 week window for the apheresis 
collection does not apply to historical samples (e.g. if an approved apheresis sample has been 
collected outside of the 12 week timeframe, this will not be considered a protocol 
violation/deviation.   If a historical apheresis sample is used, the patient would not have to repeat 
the baseline apheresis. If a historical apheresis product is not available, an apheresis procedure 
(as described above) will be performed for cell procurement after study eligibility has been 
confirmed. 
6.[ADDRESS_1158786] recent 
therapy.  Prior to CART-19 cell infusion, an additional chemotherapy cycle is planned.  Patients 
referred with stable disease on no recent therapy will be eligible.  The regimen of chemotherapy 
will be at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on the patient’s disease burden, 
histology and past therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Chemotherapy may include cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, bendamustine or any other 
appropriate combination chemotherapy. 
 
The chemotherapy will be planned so that it completes approximately 1-[ADDRESS_1158787] dose of CART19 cells.  Each regimen is of different duration so the 
start day of chemotherapy will vary.  The purpose of the chemotherapy is to induce lymphopenia 
in order to facilitate engraftment and homeostatic expansion of CART-19 cells.  In addition, 
chemotherapy can potentiate the ability of T cells to kill tumor cells85, 86. The chemotherapy is 
not investigational and may be given by a patient’s local oncologist within the specified time 
frame. 
 
All patients must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] ( RVP ) within 10 days prior to the planned 
CART -19 infusion. If the patient is positive for influenza, Tamiflu® or equivalent,  should 
administered for [ADDRESS_1158788] 7 days to be sure 
clinical symptoms of a viral infection do not develop.  If clinical symptoms develop, the infusion 
will be delayed until resolution of these symptoms. 
 
If it has been greater than 42 days since the subjects ’ previous radiologic disease assessment 
(performed for enrollment), a repeat CT/MRI of the chest/abdomen/pelvis is required prior to 
receiving cytoreductive chemotherapy.   If it has been less than 42 day s since the subjects’ 
enrollment radiologic disease assessment, but the subject has received additional treatment 
during this time, a repeat CT/MRI of the chest/abdomen/pelvis is also required prior to receiving 
cytoreductive chemotherapy.

PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is per-
mitted as long as it is PET negative. 
 
2b. Vari
ably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on CT to normal size (≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1158797] transverse diameter 
for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_1158798] de-
cre
ased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment. 
 
3.   The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical 
exam
ination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphoma should dis-
appear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a 
spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen 
may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth fac-
tors, or causes other than lymphoma. 
 
4.   If the bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must have 
cle
ared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is inde-
terminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064]. A sample that 
is negative by [CONTACT_248288] a small population of clonal 
lymphocytes by [CONTACT_127891] a CR until data become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome. 
 
Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu): 
 
The use of the above definition for CR and that below for PR eliminates the category of CRu. 
 
 
Partial Response (PR): 
 
The designation of PR requires all of the following:  
1. At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected ac-
cording to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpen-
dicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; and 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1158799] regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in 
the greatest transverse diameter. 
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.  
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was posi-
tive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large-
cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_834464]-
teria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered 
partial responders. 
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but 
with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial re-
sponders. 
6. No new  sites of disease should be observed. 
7. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357] -avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least 
one previously involved site. 
8. Varia bly FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreat-
ment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used. 
 
In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle-cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated with 
one or at most two residual masses that have regressed by [CONTACT_726] 50% on CT; those with 
more than two residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be considered partial 
responders. 
 
Stable Disease (SD): 
 
Stable disease (SD) is defined as the following:  
1. A patie nt is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a 
CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after 
CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]). 
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20358] -avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with 
no new areas of involvement on the post-treatment CT or PET. 
3. Varia bly FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreat-
ment PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in th e 
size of the previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan. 
 
Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD): 
 
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm regardless of 
the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered ab-
normal if its short axis is more than 1.0. Lymph nodes ≤ 1.0 × ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1158800] a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less 
than 1.[ADDRESS_1158801] increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.5 × 1.[ADDRESS_1158802] a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node 
more than 1 cm in its short axis. 
4. Lesions  should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]-avid lymphoma or the le-
sion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with 
current PET systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_1158803]).

7 STATISTICAL PLAN  
7.1 General Design Issues 
This is an open label, Phase IIa study to provide exploratory data on the efficacy of CART-19, in 
patients with chemotherapy relapsed or refractory CD19+ lymphoma. Failure to complete the 
study due to the treatment limiting toxicity being invoked will be the main basis for determining 
safety and feasibility.  
 
Upon enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis.  Between leukapheresis and CART-19 
infusion, patients may undergo a n additional chemotherapy treatment at the treating physician’s 
discretion.  At dosing, patients will receive CART-[ADDRESS_1158806] infusion in accordance with FDA guidelines for retroviral 
vectors.   
 
Sixty evaluable subjects will be targeted for this study, with an expected rate of drop out of up to 
20-30% due to disease progression between enrollment and the week twelve post -dosing 
response assessment (this will take about 22-24 weeks for screening-apheresis-dosing-to the final

 12 week endpoint).  Additionally, we anticipate an approximately 20% screen failure rate due to 
subjects not meeting eligibility criteria (e.g., unsuccessful cell expansion screen test) based on 
our current experience. Thus, approximately [ADDRESS_1158807]-dosing 
response assessment.   
7.2
 Sample Size  
A total of 60  evaluable subjects will be planned for analysis of the primary endpoints, Subjects 
are enrolled in 3 cohorts.  Sample sizes are determined by [CONTACT_834465][INVESTIGATOR_834421]-cohorts. Cohort A has 39 evaluable subjects: with a minimum of 20 with diffuse large B cell 
lym
phoma (DLBCL) and a minimum of [ADDRESS_1158808] either follicular lymphoma (FL) or mantle 
cell lymphoma (MCL) (enrolled on a first come fir st-served basis). Cohort B has 7 evaluable 
subj
ects with DLBCL and T cell/histiocyte-rich disease. Cohort C has 14 evaluable subjects with 
DLBCL treated with humanized CART19. 
 
The pri
mary endpoint of this study is overall response (i.e. either complete response or partial 
response) evaluated at three months post infusion. For cohort A, the following table displays the 
exact 95% confidence interval (CI) with various observed ORR.

 cells at the intended dose range and completed the response assessments for the 
primary efficacy endpoint as planned by [CONTACT_760]. Efficacy evaluable patients 
also include those with disease progression or death prior to the primary efficacy 
endpoint response assessment. These are the primary efficacy evaluable patients 
as defined below. The Efficacy Evaluable Set will be used for the primary effica-
cy endpoi
nt analysis.  
 The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  comprises all patients who received the CART-19 
cel
ls. This set includes both primary efficacy evaluable and non-evaluable pa-
ti
ents as defined below. The Full Analysis Set will be used for the secondary effi-
cacy,
 safety and correlative endpoints or other exploratory analyses. 
 
Definitions relevant to the Analysis Sets: 
1) Screening failure  - Any patient who fails to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria speci-
fied by [CONTACT_760].  
 
2) Manufacturing failure  – Any patient who has manufactured CART-19 cells that do not 
m
eet the manufacturing release criteria or the minimum protocol-specified dose (1x108 
CART -19 cells).   
3) Primary efficacy evaluable patient – Any patient who is infused with the CART-19 
cel
ls at the protocol-specified dose (1-5x108) and completed the response assessments for 
the primary efficacy endpoint as planned by [CONTACT_760]. Efficacy evaluable patients also 
incl
ude those with disease progression or death prior to the primary efficacy endpoint re-
sponse assessment. 
4) Primary efficacy non-evaluable patient  – Any patient who is infused with the CART -
19 cells at less than the protocol-specified dose. These patients are also counted as manu-
facturing failures. 
7.5 Statistical Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be computed for all study variables for the evaluable populations as 
whole and within cohort and histology subgroups. Primary endpoint of overall response will be 
summarized as overall response rate (ORR) and 95% exact confidence interval will be calculated 
based on binomial distribution. All adverse events will be described and exact 95% confidence 
intervals will be produced for adverse event rates, both overall and within major categories. 
Overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response will be analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier curves. Median survival time and survival probability at selected time points (e.g., 
3 month) will be computed with associated confidence interval. To evaluate the persistence of 
CART -19 (or its subsets), the within-subject change in the ratio of CART-19 cells (or other 
subsets) between two pre-specified time points will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test, or to simultaneously analyze multiple times, linear mixed effects model methodology will 
be used.  The use of the nonparametric test is very efficient (>95%) compared to the t-test if the 
underlying data are normally distributed.  Other secondary endpoints in this trial are all measured 
as continuous variable and can be analyzed in a similar fashion using nonparametric Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test. All the analyses will be two-sided and cut-off for statistical significance will be 
5%.

 The number of patients enrolled versus the number of patients infused will be described and is a

be computed.  
 
8 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Definitions 
 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.   
 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that 
is:  
 fatal  
 li fe-threatening 
 req uires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 res ults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenita l anomaly or birth defect 
 an im portant medical event 
 
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20107]: 
 Routine treatm ent or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deteri-
oration in condition, such as preplanned study visits and preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834422] 
 Elective  or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indi-
cation under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 
 Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general 
condition 
Note that treatment on an emergency outpatient basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_286743] a SAE given above is 
not a serious adverse event.  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].

CON
FIDENTIAL
 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_145158]. 
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Unexpected adverse events 
An adverse event is considered unexpected (or unanticipated) if the event severity and/or 
frequency 
is not described in the investigator brochure and/or protocol (in the absence of an 
Investigator Brochure).  Please refer to the investigator brochure for additional detail related to 
severity and/or frequency of a particular event.  
 
Related adverse events 
An adverse event is considered related to participation in the research if there is a reasonab le 
possibility that an event was caused by [CONTACT_20141], intervention or research-
required procedures.  For the purposes of this study, "reasonable possibility" mea ns the re is 
evidence to sugge st a causal relationship.  
 
Treatment Limiting Toxicity (TLT) 
Treatment limiting toxicity is defined as an unexpected grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity 
probably related to the CART-19 infusion (for instance grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia 
rel
ated to pre-infusion chemotherapy would not be related to study drug and would not be 
considered as TLT ).  
 
Ad
verse Event Reporting Period 
For this study, collection of adverse events will begin on Day 0 (from the start of the CART-19 
infusion) and continue until the subject is off study or until the year [ADDRESS_1158813] is taken off study within 30 days of the T-cell infusion, all SAEs experienced within 
30 days after the T-cell infusion should be reported to the sponsor. Any SAEs experienced after 
this 30 day period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator suspects a causal 
relationship to the study treatment. 
 
Preexisting Condition/General Physical Examination Findings 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.   At screening, any 
clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition on the medical 
history eCRF. During the course of the study, a preexisting condition should be recorded as an 
adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the 
study period. Preexisting conditions that improve should also be recorded appropriately. 
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality 
 The abnormal ity suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity

  The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc. 
 
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for Adverse Events should be followed until they 
have returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. When an 
abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported adverse 
event, it is not necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional event. Laboratory 
abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as 
adverse events. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a 
SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined above and/or as per investigator’s 
discretion.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (i.e. 
anemia instead of low hemoglobin). 
8.[ADDRESS_1158814] symptoms if a diagnosis can be assigned.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the adverse event reporting period (defined in Section 8.1 
above) must be recorded.   
 
As much as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 
1. The severit y grade (CTCAE Grade 1-5) 
2. It s duration (start and end dates)  
3. It s relationship to the study treatment - [Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No 
(unr
elated/ not suspected) or Yes (a suspected adverse reaction)].  If yes (suspected) - 
is t
he event possibly, probably or definitely related to the investigational treatment?    
4. Expect edness to study treatment- [Unexpected- if the event severity and/or frequency 
is not described in the investigator brochure and protocol (in the absence of an investi-
gator brochure) ]. 
5. Action t aken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, 
temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)

 6. W hether medication or therapy taken (i.e. no concomitant medication/non-drug thera-
py, concom
itant medication/non-drug therapy) 
7. W hether it is serious; as defined in Section 8 .1. 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug 
therapy is given, this action should be recorded.  Once an adverse event is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made 
at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected 
relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.   
Adverse events that occur concurrently with the progression of malignancy but that are not 
related to disease progression (i.e. deep vein thrombosis or hemoptysis) will be reported as an 
adverse event as described above.  Progression of malignancy resulting in death should be 
reported as a serious adverse event. 
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the adverse event reporting period must 
be followed to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
adverse event reporting period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or 
study participation, should be recorded and reported. 
 
Grading 
System for Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
A protocol specific grading system ( Table 8-1) has been developed to capture cytokine release 
syndr
ome (CRS) in CAR T-cell protocols.  Please refer to section 1.5.2 for additional detail on 
CRS in CAR T-cell therapy.   
 
For the purposes of reporting and grading on clinical trials using CART-19 cells, we will use the 
following grading for CRS Toxicity.  The start date of CRS is a retrospective assessment of the 
date of onset of persistent fevers and/or myalgia consistent with CRS and not explained by [CONTACT_834466] (i.e. sepsis). The stop date of CRS is defined as the date when the patient has been afebrile 
for 24 hours and off vasopressors for 24 hours.  For the purposes of defining the CRS start date, a 
fever is defined as a temperature of 100.4°F/38°C.

Attention: Sponsor Clinical Safety Manager or designee 
 
 
 
 
At the time of the initial notification, the following information should be provided: 
 Study identifier  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset  
 Current status   Whether study treatment was discontinued  
 The reason the event is classified as serious  
 Investigator assessment of the association

8.3.1 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRBs 
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_249924], affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety reporting to the 
IRB. The IRB requires expedited reporting of those events related to study participation that are 
unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The IRB will 
not acknowledge safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria 
outlined below.  The IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 
10 working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event: 
 
Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non-serious, on-site or off-
site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_445652]: 
 
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not 
accurately reflected in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved 
informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, such as product 
labeling and package inserts.) 
AND  
Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than 
not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].) 
 
Reporting Process 
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the 
IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including 
Reportable Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including a description of the 
event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and 
need for revision to consent form and/or other study documentation).

 Reporting Deaths:  more rapid reporting requirements  
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following describes the 
more rapid reporting requirement of the Penn IRB for specific situations: 
 Report the event within 72 hours, when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and indicates 
participants or others are at increased risk of harm. 
 
For reportable deaths, the initi al submission to the IRB may be made by [CONTACT_350368]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up 
to the initial submission. 
 
Other Reportable events: 
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the IRB: 
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_85400]. 
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected. 
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research 
study is of no therapeutic value. 
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol. 
 Breach of confident
iality 
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research participant. 
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on 
the study. 
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051]. 
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_237614], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects. 
8.3.2 Reporting obligations to the DSMC of the ACC 
All events that meet the DSMC definition of reportable AE’s must be promptly entered into 
Velos.

 The DSMC requires AE/SAE submission as follows:  
 Unless  covered by [CONTACT_133622], grade [ADDRESS_1158816] be reported within 10 
days of knowledge of the adverse event.  
Except
ions:  
o Grade 3 and 4 events  that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_834425]- with the exception 
of those that could be symptoms/early indicators of any of the toxicities defined in 
the Toxicity Management section of the protocol, signs/symptoms of an allergic 
response, severe hypotensive crisis or any other reaction to the infusion.  
o All gr ade 3 or 4 events t hat are judged by a study investigator to be clearly unre-
lated to protocol therapy.  
o Grade 3 or 4 events that are probably or definitely related to progression of dis-
ease as judged by [CONTACT_1704].  
o Grade 3 or 4 events that are probably or definitely related to an FDA approved 
agent.  
 All une xpected deaths within one business day of knowledge  
 All ot hers deaths within [ADDRESS_1158817] study treatment/intervention are not reportable unless a longer 
time frame is specified in the protocol.

o Unexpected  fatal or life -threatening  suspected adverse reaction.   
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1158819] ed and unexpected Grade 3 or higher events of cytokine release syndrome 
per the modified CRS grading scale in Table 8-1 
o All fatal events occurring within 30 days of T-cell infusion, regardless of 
attribution and expectedness 
 Wit hin 15 Calendar Days 
Any study event that is:  
o unexpected 
o Suspected a dverse reaction that is serious, but not fatal or life-threatening

o a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from 
when event was deemed reportable). 
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that: 
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, 
teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the 
expected human exposure. 
Increase in rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions: 
o any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse 
reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
Additional Reporting Requirements 
Sponsors are also required to review all adverse events to make a causality determination on the

followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the 
birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications.  
 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_834468]. Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded on the same form 
and must include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment of any 
pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE

8.4.1 Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729280]: 
 Any subject develops uncontrolled T cell proliferation that does not respond to 
management. 
 Premature study termination may occur if the Investigator, Study Funder, Sponsor, 
DSMB, Medical Monitor, ACC DSMC or any independent review board or regulatory 
body decides for any reason that subject safety may be compromised by [CONTACT_603783]. 
 Premature study termination may occur if the Sponsor or Study Funder decides to

 modifications, then the pause will be lifted. 
 
The protocol manufacturing will be paused to review the manufacturing process should there be 
>33% primary efficacy non-evaluable patients (i.e. the manufacturing process fails to meet the 
protocol-specified dose range of 1-5x108 CART -19 cells). 
 
If the study is paused for manufacturing reasons, the PI, members of the study team, Protocol 
Advisor, Clinical Operations and Cell Manufacturing will meet to identify manufacturing failure. 
The team will make recommendations for process improvements to be implemented. Pending 
successful completion of a process validation run, the manufacturing pause will be lifted. 
8.4.2 General toxicity management considerations 
 Replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) may be generated during the CA RT-[ADDRESS_1158823](s), and therefore, monitoring for RCL will be conducted during the course of 
the trial. 
 
Regulatory agencies and the gene therapy community have previously discussed measures 
to be taken should an RCL be confirmed in a subject. However, because the probability 
and characteristics of an RCL are unknown, no guidelines have been put in place. 
Nevertheless, all agree that the subject must be isolated until an understanding of how to 
manage the subject becomes clear. Some considerations are  
o Int ensive follow-up of subject in consultation with gene therapy experts, study 
investigators, FDA and NIH. 
o Inform  local public health officials and CDC. 
o Identify sexual partners and provide appropriate counseling and intervention.  
 
RCL will be monitored by a suitable Q-PCR DNA assay for detection of the lentivirus (for 
example: HIV gag DNA or VSV-G DNA). If a positive RCL DNA assay result is 
obtained, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729283] a retest for the DNA test.   
If the second DNA test is positive, then infusions will be temporarily halted.  The patient 
will undergo a blood draw for isolation of HIV from his/her cells.  The virus will be 
sequenced and compared to sequences of the transfer vector and packaging constructs, as 
well as to available HIV sequences to determine the origin of the virus.  Determination of 
the origin of the virus can be easily performed by [CONTACT_834469], vpr and vpu which are not present in the packaging constructs.  If the 
sequence is derived from wt-HIV then infusions for all subjects can resume, and the

 patient will be referred to treatment for HIV.  If an RCL is confirmed, or the virus cannot 
be isolated from the blood draw, the patient will be scheduled for apheresis and will 
undergo a full biological RCL testing for detection and/or characterization of the RCL.   
 
 Clonality and insertional oncogenesis:   
Four of nine treated patients in a gene therapy trial for X-linked Severe Combined Immu-
nodeficiency (SCID) developed T cell leukemia 31-[ADDRESS_1158824]-treatment. The T cell 
leukemias were attributable to clonal expansion conferred by [CONTACT_834470]-
gration sites in the CD34+ bone marrow stem cell modification112. This represents the 
most severe adverse event caused by [CONTACT_708895]. However, there is also evidence 
for retroviral vector integration site dominance in a gene therapy trial of -thalassaemia 
without malignancy113. The lentiviral vector used for CART19 manufacturing is part of a 
vector class that may have a lower risk for integration in or near oncogenic regions than 
oncoretroviral vectors114. As of March 2014, none of the patients treated with CART19 
have developed a new malignancy, T cell or otherwise, related to lentiviral vector integra-
tion. Subjects will be monitored for evidence of unexpected CART19 expansion by 
[CONTACT_288479]19 transgene quantitation by [CONTACT_834471]-
plete blood count ( CBC) as part of the study design. If an unexpected pattern of CART19 
expansion is observed (i.e. CART19 expansion in the absence of CD19+ target), subjects 
will be closely monitored clinically for new malignancies, particularly T cell, and further 
studies, including insertion site analysis, will be considered to investigate the molecular 
basis of the expansion. Investigators should consult with the Regulatory Sponsor if an un-
expected pattern of CART19 expansion and/or a new malignancy arises. Subjects will be 
sim
ilarly monitored for clonality and insertional oncogenesis when enrolled on the long 
term follow up protocol. 
 
 Uncontrolled T cell proliferation . CART-[ADDRESS_1158825] develops excessive CART-19 cell accumulation, 
corticosteroids will be administered to eradicate the infused cells.  
 
Toxicity associated with allogeneic or autologous T cell infusions has been managed with 
a course of pharmacologic immunosuppression. T body associated toxicity has been 
reported to respond to systemic corticosteroids95.  If uncontrolled T cell proliferation 
occurs (grade 3 or 4 toxicity related to CART-19 cells), subjects may be treated with 
corticosteroids. Subjects will be treated with pulse methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg i.v. 
divided q8 hr x 2 days), followed by a rapid taper.  
 
 B cell depletion . It is possible that B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia will 
occur. This is an expected “on target” effect of the CART-19 cells. B cell depletion is 
common with anti-CD20 directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]115. B cell depletion has been observed in CLL 
and ALL patients treated with CART-19 cells. In the event of clinically significant 
hypogammaglobulinemia (i.e. systemic infections), subjects will be given intravenous

 Infusion reaction. Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride may be repeated 
every [ADDRESS_1158826] on CART-19 cells.  
 
 Febrile rea ction. In the event of febrile reaction, an evaluation for infection should be 
initiated, and patients managed appropriately with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive 
care as medically indicated and determined by [CONTACT_1963].   In the event tha t the 
patient develops sepsis or systemic bac t eremia following CAR T ce ll   infusion,   
appropriate   culture s   and   medi cal   management   should   be   initiated.   If   a

release syndrome (see below) should be given.   
 
 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) / Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)  
CRS has been observed in patients after treatment with CART-19. Patients with clinical 
responses exhibited some level of CRS that ranged from mild to severe consisting of fe-
vers, hypotension, capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], hypoxia or other symptoms (See Section 1.5.2 and 8.2).  
All patients who have responded to CART-[ADDRESS_1158828] experienced a CRS.  
 
Cytokine production is required for the activation, expansion and cytolytic function of T 
cells and for CART-19 T cells.  Therefore some degree of CRS may be a desired clinical 
outcome. Premature or early intervention with anti-cytokine therapy may therefore 
abrogate the anti-tumor efficacy of CART-19. Subsequent to this experience, selective 
tocilizumab (an anti-IL6-receptor antibody) therapy has been utilized (described below) 
with effective toxicity management and successful ongoing CART-[ADDRESS_1158829] managed with 
administration of tocilizumab. 
  
Tocil
izumab should be used as a single, weight-based dose of 8 mg/kg at the time of 
hem
odynamic instability. This management approach is designed to avoid life-
threatening toxicities, while attempting to allow the CART-19 cells to establish a 
proliferative phase that appears to correlate with anti-tumor efficacy. Thus, the timing of 
the tocilizumab should be individualized, in close consultation with the Principal

 Investigator and/or expert consultants for the trial.  Steroids have not always been 
effective in this setting and may not be necessary given the rapid response to tocilizumab. 
Because steroids will interfere with CART-19 function and efficacy, if used, they should 
be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_333379].  
 
Upon developi[INVESTIGATOR_379185]-persistent fevers following CART-19 infusion, 
patients should then be followed closely. Infection and tumor lysis syndrome work up 
should be immediately undertaken.  The pharmacy should be notified of the potential 
need for tocilizumab.  Patient management in an intensive care unit may be required and 
the timing is dependent upon local institutional practice. In addition to supportive care, 
tocilizumab may be administered in cases of moderate to severe CRS, especially if the 
patient exhibits any of the following: 
 He modynamic instability despi[INVESTIGATOR_834426] 
 Worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], including pulmonary infiltrates, increasing oxygen re-
quirement including high-flow O2, and/or need for mechanical ventilation.  
 Any other s igns or symptoms of rapid deterioration despi[INVESTIGATOR_834427] 8 mg/kg i.v. single dose. Not all Grade [ADDRESS_1158830] been immediately treated with tocilizumab and 
deci
sions are, in part, based upon the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_379188]. 
 
Other anti-cytokine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as repeat administration of tocilizumab or use of 
siltuximab or etanercept, may also be considered if the patient does not respond to the 
initial dose of tocilizumab.  If the patient experiences ongoing CRS despi[INVESTIGATOR_834428]-cytokine directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], anti T-cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614151], 
ATG, campath may be considered.   
 
CR
S has been associated with biochemical and physiologic abnormalities consistent with 
MAS.  Moderate to extreme elevations in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin 
have been seen with CART-19 associated CRS, however the magnitude and kinetics vary 
greatly between individual patients.  CRS management decisions should be based upon 
clinical signs and symptoms and response to interventions, not these laboratory values 
per se . Refer to Figure 8-1 below for a CRS Management Algorithm.  
 
CTCAE grading of CRS relates to its occurrence with acute infusional toxicities, whereas 
the CRS associated with CART-19 therapy is not acute, but rather delayed. Refer to 
Section 8.1 and Table 8-1 for modified definitions of grading of CART-19 delayed CRS

8.5 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
Exception  
A one time, intentional  action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved 
study protocol, intended for one occurrence.   If the action disrupts the study progress, such that 
the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the 
safety and welfare of study subjects, advance  documented approval from the Regulatory 
Sponsor, IRB, ACC DSMC and other local regulatory review committees per institutional 
guideline
s is required.   Approval from the Regulatory Sponsor must be received prior to 
submission to the IRB, ACC DSMC and local regulatory review committees for approval.  
 
No exception would be granted if the action disrupts the study progress, such that the study 
design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety and 
welfare of study subjects. 
 
No exceptions to eligibility will be granted for this study.   
 
Deviation  
A one time, unintentional  action or process that departs from the approved study protocol, 
involving one incident and identified retrospectively , after the event occurred. If the impact on 
the protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the outcome (endpoints) or compromises the 
safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation must be reported to the Regulatory Sponsor and 
ACC DSMC within 5 business days and the IRB within 10 business days of PI [INVESTIGATOR_115260].  
 
Any depart
ure from the protocol that meets the following criteria is a protocol deviation and

The Sponsor Project Manager wi ll submit the exception request or deviation notification to t he 
Regulatory Sponsor fo r review and appro val.   Once approval of the exception request or 
acknowledgement of the deviation has been granted by [CONTACT_834473], the exception or deviation will be submitted to the IRB, ACC DSMC and all other 
applicable committees for review and approval.  
 
Other deviations should be explained in a memo to file (such as a subject missing a visit- unless a 
critical/important treatment or procedure was missed and must have been done at that specific 
time).  
8.6 Medical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-
monitoring plan (see section 10 Study Monitoring, Auditing and Inspecting).  Medical 
m
onitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
 
A protocol-specific independent Medical Monitor with appropriate expertise and experience has 
been recruited in addition to the DSMB to review subject safety data and ensure the safety of 
participants.  The Medical Monitor will receive real-time reporting of any event that could 
potentially impact subject safety (including dose-limiting toxicities).  The Medical Monitor will 
also receive all of the following:   
 All Ser ious Adverse Events (regardless of expectedness/relatedness).  The SAE will be 
reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the study team’s awareness . 
 Deviat ions reported to the regulatory sponsor, ACC DSMC and IRB as they occur 
 Except ions prior to submission to the IRB and ACC DSMC 
 Continuing Review Reports 
 All que ries issued by [CONTACT_6802] (including those related to grading, attribution and ex-
pect
edness of adverse events).  
 
The Medical Monitor will correspond via email to communicate: 
 SA E acknowledgement  and inquiries 
 Deviat ion acknowledgement, inquiries, recommendations 
 Except ion acknowledgement, inquiries and approval/disapproval 
 Continuing review acknowledgement, inquiries  
 
The Medical Monitor will review and acknowledge the above, and make recommendations 
whether to continue with the study,  amend the study, and/or stop/pause the study as needed.

statistician will be assembled, and will work under a charter specifically developed for safety 
oversight of this study.  The DSMB will provide guidance/advice to the Sponsor.  The DSMB 
will evaluate patient-subject safety as specified in the DSMB Charter.   
 
The DSMB will meet approximately every 4 months.  If necessary, additional meetings of the 
DSMB may be held if safety issues arise in between scheduled meetings. 
 
It
 is envisioned that the DSMB may make four types of recommendations, namely: 
• No saf ety or efficacy issues, ethical to continue the study as planned 
• Seri ous safety concerns precluding further study treatment, regardless of efficacy 
• Overwhelm ing evidence for futility, recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. 
• Recom mendation to continue the study but proposing an amendment to the protocol (e.g., 
incorporate an additional safety assessments) 
 
If the study is recommended to continue by [CONTACT_4318], no details about the results of the current 
interim analysis will be revealed prior to the next scheduled analysis.  A Regulatory Sponsor 
representative will submit a DSMB outcome letter to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_834430] [ADDRESS_1158834] ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by [CONTACT_834474].  Signed informed consent forms and patient 
enrollment log must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site.   
 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 W hat protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 W ho will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The ri ghts of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at 
the end of their scheduled study period.

 9.2 Source Documents 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents   Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memorand a, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial. 
9.3 Case Report Forms 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded. All entries will be entered into an electronic 
data capture system (EDC). The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_834431], accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely 
manner. 
9.4 Records Retention 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_1158835].  These documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an 
instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
10 STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
This study will be monitored according to the Sponsor Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 
Interim Monitoring Visits will be conducted during the course of the study. The Monitors will 
assure that submitted data are accurate and in agreement with source documentation; verify that 
investigational products are properly stored and accounted for; verify that subject consent for 
study participation has been properly obtained and documented; confirm that research subjects 
entered into the study meet inclusion and exclusion criteria; and assure that all essential 
documentation required by [CONTACT_20148] (GCP) guidelines are appropriately filed.  At 
the end of the study, Monitors will conduct a close-out visit and will advise on storage of study 
records and disposition of unused investigational products. 
 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will 
also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to

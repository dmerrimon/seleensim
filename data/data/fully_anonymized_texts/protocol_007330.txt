history section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during  the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the investigator  assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include date of 
occurrence, severit y, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the investigator  must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator products on the device deficiency eCRF. The site must  
submit all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• All SAEs must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) of the investigator ’s or site’s 
awareness .  
• ADEs that do not meet seriousness crit eria and device deficiencies must be reported 
within 10 calendar days of the investigator ’s or site’s awareness .  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
• Document any chang es to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from discharge summary, autopsy report, certificate 
of death, etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the adverse device effect (for related 
AEs) and Serious Adv erse Event  eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become nonoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper serious adverse event and adverse device effect and/or device deficiency form.

Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device  deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271]’s medical records. The 
investigator  must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regul atory authorities or IRB/IEC.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigator  must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator  must assess the causality ( related or not related to 
the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed by 
[CONTACT_432574], as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_443411].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes fo r the AE).  
The study sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator  of any AE that is 
upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to relate d.

unma sking the information if there is sufficient time. Dependent upon the individual 
circumstances (i.e., medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to contact [CONTACT_819761]. The study sponsor must be informed of all cases in which the code was broken 
and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, the study sponsor may be required to 
unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting requirements.  
11.6 Follow -up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The investigator  is responsible f or adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator  should provide the study sponsor with any new safety informati on (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved /ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be docum ented in the eCRFs 
up to study completion (i.e., database lock).  
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the post market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated 
to the medical devi ce’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
The investigator  should also report complaints on non -Alcon products (i.e., Biofinity Toric ) 
directly to the manufacturer as per the manufacturer’s instructions or local regulatory 
requirements.  
11.7 Pregnancy in the  Clinical Study  
Women who are pregnant (as stated by [CONTACT_1130]) at the time of study entry are excluded from 
participation. However, p regnancy should be included in the Pregnancy eCRF if a woman  
becomes pregnant (as stated by [CONTACT_423])  during the study. P regnancy is not reportable as 
an AE; however, complications may be reportable and will be decided on a case -by-case 
basis.

12.6 Safety Analys es 
The safety endpoints are:  
• AEs 
• Biomicroscopy findings  
• Device deficiencies  
There are no safety hypotheses planned in this study. The focus of the safety analysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessme nt of occurrence of AEs as well as the other listed 
parameters.  
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs the informed consent to study exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (frequencies and percentages) for 
ocular and nonocular AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_243295]. AEs leading to study discontinuation and SAEs will be identified. Individual 
subject listings will be provided, as necessary. Individual subject listings will be provided for 
AEs that occur after signing informed consent but prior to exposure to IP.  
Each biomicroscopy parameter will be tabulated by [CONTACT_13296]. For each biomicroscopy 
parameter, counts and percentages of eyes that experience an increase of ≥ 2 grades from 
baseline (last assessment prior to study lens exposure) to any subsequent visit will be 
presented. A supportive listing will be generated which will  include all biomicroscopy data 
from all visits for those eyes experiencing the increase.  
Two listings for device deficiencies, prior to exposure to study lenses and treatment -
emergent, will be provided. Additionally, each device deficiency category will b e tabulated.  
No inferential testing will be conducted for the safety analyses.

Title of Study:   
A Phase 2b, Open -Label, Single-Arm Study of Selinexor (KPT-330) Plus Low-Dose 
Dexamethasone (Sd) in Patients with Multiple Myeloma Previously  Treated with 
Lenalidomide, Pomalidomide, Bort ezomib, Carfilzomib, and Daratu mumab, and  
Refractory to Prior Treatment with Glucocorticoids, an Immunomodulatory Agent, a 
Proteasome Inhibitor, and the anti-CD38 mAb Daratumumab 
Protocol Number:  KCP-330-012: STORM (Selinexor Treat ment of Refractory Myeloma) 
Indication:  Multiple myeloma previously treated with lenalidomide, pomalid omide, 
bortezomib, carfilzomib, and daratumumab, and refractory to pri or treatment with 
glucocorticoids, an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome  inhibitor (PI), and the 
anti-CD38 mAb daratumumab (penta-refractory MM) 
Objectives: 
Primary:  
Evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate [ORR]) for treatme nt with selinexor 80 mg 
plus low -dose dexamethasone (20 mg) (Sd) twice weekly (four- week cycles) in patients 
with MM previously treated with  lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, 
and daratumumab, and refractory to prior treatment with glucoco rticoids, an 
immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and  the anti -CD38 mAb 
daratumumab (herein referr ed to as penta-refractory MM). 
ORR will include patients who experience partial response (PR),  very good partial 
response (VGPR), complete response (CR), or stringent complete response (sCR), based 
on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria  (Kumar 2016 ) for 
patients with penta-refractory MM in Part 2 (Expansion). 
Secondary:  
The following endpoints will be analyzed separately for (a) Part 1 patients with quad -
refractory MM (i.e., previously treated with lenalidomide, poma lidomide, bortezomib, 
carfilzomib,  but not an anti-CD38 mab), (b) Part 1 patients with penta- refractory MM, and 
(c) Part 2 (expansion) patients with penta -refractory MM. Additionally, analyses of safety 
and tolerability will be performed on the overall population of patients from Pa rts [ADDRESS_728950] one dose of study treatment.  
x Duration of response (DOR = Dur ation from first observation of at least PR to time 
of disease progression, or deaths due to disease progression, whichever occurs first.  
DOR will be censored for death due to any causes other than disease progression. 
x Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR = sCR + CR + VGPR + PR + minimal response [MR]), 
and duration of clinical benefit (Duration from first observation of at least MR to 
time of disease progression or death due to disease progression, whichever occurs 
first. Duration of clinical benefit will be censored for death due to any causes other 
than disease progression)

Selinexor (KPT-330) Developmental Phase: 
Phase 2b 
eventually relapse with their disease becoming drug-resistant. With over 12,600 deaths 
from MM anticipated in 2016 in the US alone, there is an unmet medical need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_555222]/or refractory (RR) MM that has progressed on available 
treatments.  
Selinexor is an orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of nuc lear export (SINE) compound 
that specifically blocks exportin 1 (XPO1). Selinexor and other  SINE compounds have 
demonstrated anti -MM activity in preclinical studies.  In the Phase- 1 study, selinexor alone 
(all doses) showed an ORR of 5%, and with low -dose dexamethasone (Sd; all do ses) the 
ORR was 32%.   Therefore, the Sd regimen was carried forward in to this ongoing Phase 2 
study.   
Rationale for Expansion (protocol version 4.0)  
For Part [ADDRESS_728951] been evaluated 
([ADDRESS_728952] measurable MM at baseline): 
48 patients with quad-refractory MM (IMIDs and PIs) and 30 patients with penta-
refractory MM (quad + anti-CD38 refractory). Patients were initially dosed with 6 doses of  
Sd per cycle, and this was increased to 8 doses of Sd per cycle . The ORR adjudicated by a 
four-physician Independent Review Committee (IRC) across all patients was 21% and the 
clinical benefit rate (CBR) is 33%. Similar ORR were seen in th e patients with “penta” and 
“quad” MM, with higher CBR in patients who received 8 vs. 6 doses/cycle consist ent with 
improved disease control with c ontinuous dosing. The median dur ation of response (DOR) 
was ~5  months, with 9 patients continuing on study. There was a trend  towards higher 
ORR in the 8-dose per cycle Sd regimen, with lit tle difference in tolerabili ty. Furthermore, 
there was a trend to increased time on study in patients with b aseline hemoglobin (Hb) 
≥ 8.5 gm/dL. Therefore, based on the current unmet medical need for p atients with RR 
MM and these preliminary clinical re sults, this study is now being  expanded to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of twice-weekly Sd in patients with pen ta-refractory MM.  
Methodology : 
This is a Phase 2b, single -arm, open- label, multicenter study of Sd, dosed twice weekly 
each week in four -week cycles, in patients with penta- refractory MM (Parts 1 and 2) or 
quad -refractory MM (Part 1 only).  
The population for the primary efficacy analys is will contain only patients with penta-
refractory MM enrolled in Part 2. Response results for patients  with quad -refractory MM 
and patients with penta -refractory MM enrolled in Part [ADDRESS_728953] one dose of study drug, presented overall and by [CONTACT_555251], and separately for Part 1 
penta -refractory and quad-refractory patient populations. 
Patients will receive treatment until progressive disease (PD),  death, toxicity that cannot be 
managed by [CONTACT_555252], or withdrawal, whichever occurs first.

Selinexor (KPT-330) Developmental Phase: 
Phase 2b 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: 
Selinexor will be given at an oral fixed milligram (mg) dose of  80 mg twice weekly each 
week for four -week cycles (total of 8 selinexor doses per cycle).  
Dexamethasone 20 mg will be given with each dose of selinexor . If a patient develops 
partial intolerance to glucoc orticoids (as determined by [CONTACT_108899]) during the study, 
a minimum dose of dexamethasone [ADDRESS_728959] cases (e.g., for patients showing SD, MR or PR and tolerating treatment 
particularly well), the selin exor dose may be increased by 20 mg (i.e., to 100 mg twice 
weekly) after consultation with the Medical Monitor. The dose level for an individual 
patient may be escalated based on e fficacy considerations after  completing a minimum of 
2 cycles of study therapy. However, in no case may the dose for  a given patient exceed 
70 mg/m2.   
Concomitant Medications: 
To minimize nausea, unless contra indicated, all patients should  receive 5-
hydroxytryptamine  (5-HT3) antagonists (e.g., ondansetron 8 mg or equivalent) startin g on 
Day [ADDRESS_728960] dose of selinexor and con tinued 2-3 times daily, as needed. 
Alternative anti -emetic agents should be used if t he patient does not tolerate 5-HT3 
antagonists. Additional anti -nausea and anti- anorexia agents may be given as needed (per 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network® [NCCN] Clinical Practice Guidelines® for 
Antiemesis and NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines® for Palliative Care). Patients will also 
receive therapy as needed to mit igate selinexor side effects, a s part of best supportive care.  
Blood product transfusions, antimicrobials, and (as appropriate ) growth factors including 
granulocyte colony -stimulating factors for neutropenia, erythropoietins for anemia , and/or 
platelet -stimulating factors for throm bocytopenia are also permitted. 
Patients may continue  their baseline medi cation(s). Medications to treat concomitant 
diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc., are allowed. Pat ients will also receive 
concomitant medications that are medically necessary as standar d care to treat symptoms, 
AEs and intercurrent illnesses. Patients may receive red blood cell or platelet transfusions, 
or blood growth factors, if clinically indicated, per institutional guidelines.  
Concurrent therapy with any other approved or investigational a nti-cancer therapy is not 
allowed. Other investigational agents should not be used during  the study.  
Study Numbers: 
Approximately 210 patients will  be enrolled overall, including 79 patients (with quad -
refractory MM and penta -refractory MM) in Part 1 and ~130 patients (with penta-
refractory MM o nly) in Part 2 (to achieve the target population size of N = 12 2 for the 
primary efficacy analysis). 
Study Duration: 
The enrollment period for this study is expected to be approxim ately 24 months. There is 
no maximum treatment duration for t he study or pre-defined numb er of treatment cycles

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological m alignancy (after 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), representing 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_555227]-line agents, the m ajority of patients will 
eventually relapse and become resistant to all classes of avail able anti-MM therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. With 
over 30,000 new cases and approximately 12,600 deaths from MM a nticipated in 2016 in the 
[LOCATION_003] alone ( ACS 2016), there remains a need for novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_502200] o f 
refractory MM that can improve the overall survival rate.  
Selinexor is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) com pound that binds and 
inactivates Exportin 1 (XPO1), thereby [CONTACT_555257] (TSPs). XPO1 protein levels are significantly elevated  in MM, leading to the nuclear 
exclusion of TSPs, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and enhanc ed translation of certain 
oncogene mRNAs ( Tai 2014 ). Transient retention of TSPs in the nucleus at high levels via  
XPO1 blockade activates their cell cycle checkpoint and genome surveying actions. This 
leads to the death of nearly all types of malignant cells, wher eas normal cells undergo 
transient cell cycle arrest and recovery when the export block is released. XPO1 also exports 
the GR, leading to attenuation of its transcriptional activity.  In the presence of 
glucocorticoids, XPO1 blockade leads to nuclear accumulation and activation of the GR. In addition, XPO1 inhibition leads to the nuclear entrapment of ca p-binding protein 
(eIF4E)-dependent oncogene mRNAs, thus preventing their translation into proteins in the 
cytoplasm. In this way, SINEs lead to reduction in key oncoprot eins such as c-Myc, Cyclin 
D, hDM2 and others. The reactivati on of multiple TSP pathways a s well as glucocorticoid 
signaling, along with reduced translation of key oncoproteins t hrough inhibition of a non-
redundant, single protein, i.e., XPO1, represents a novel appro ach to the treatment of 
neoplastic diseases including t hose with multiple genomic alter ations and resistance 
mechanisms. 
Single-agent Phase [ADDRESS_728967] been cond ucted in advanced 
hematological malignancies including MM, acute myeloid leukemia  (AML), non- Hodgkin’s 
leukemia (NHL) and chronic lym phocytic leukemia (CLL) (KCP-330- 001), in solid tumors 
(KCP-330-002), and in soft tissue and bone sarcomas (KCP-330-00 3). Broad antitumor 
activity has been observed in all of these studies.  In additio n, Phase 2 studies are ongoing in 
MM, AML, DLBCL, Richter’s transformation, glioblastoma, gynecol ogical malignancies, 
and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS). More than 2,[ADDRESS_728968] frequently reported side effects of selinexor seen in clinical studies to date are 
anorexia, fatigue, nausea, vomit ing, and thrombocytopenia. Thes e adverse events (AEs) may 
be mitigated or eliminated wit h standard supportive care. In ad dition, their prevalence and 
intensity typi[INVESTIGATOR_555228] 4-[ADDRESS_728969] not been observed during long term treatment, with more th an 28 patients receiving 
single-agent selinexor for over 1 year and 6 patients for over 2 years. Please see the current 
Selinexor Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more information. 
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 32Selinexor has shown single-agent, durable, anti-cancer activity  in patients with multiple RR 
hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, including MM, at dose s of ≥ 6m g / m2body 
surface area (BSA) in initial Phase 1 dose-escalation studies. In addition, results from a small 
number of patients suggests that selinexor in combination with dexamethasone 20 mg has 
increased efficacy in RR MM patients relative to selinexor alon e (Chen 2014 , Data on file ).
In the current study, patients will receive low-dose dexamethas one (20 mg) to both improve 
the tolerability of selinexor and provide additional efficacy benefit as selinexor has been 
shown to activate glucocorticoid signaling through its receptor . Dexamethasone has been 
shown in previous studies to be a n effective prophylactic treat ment for the common AEs of 
selinexor described abov e. While untreated MM is exquisitely se nsitive to glucocorticoids, 
this benefit wanes over time with treatment, which usually incl udes glucocorticoids in 
combination therapy. Patients with MM which has relapsed after multiple treatments are
unlikely to respond to glucocorticoid treatment alone, but dexa methasone should provide 
symptomatic relief of selinexor-associated toxicity. In additio n, dexamethasone may provide 
synergistic efficacy in combination with selinexor, which can r eactivate glucocorticoid 
receptor (GCR) signaling. The curr ent study will evaluate selin exor combined with 
dexamethasone for the treatment of MM in patients whose disease is refractory to previous 
treatment with a glucocorticoid, proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory agent 
(IMiD), and the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD38 mAb) da ratumumab.
2. MULTIPLE MYELOMA 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hema tological malignancy characteriz ed by [CONTACT_555258] t he bone marrow, the presence of monoclonal 
immunoglobulin, or M protein in the serum or urine, bone diseas e, kidney disease, and 
immunodeficiency. It is more common in elderly patients (median  age at diagnosis is 
65-70 years; only 2% of patients are younger than 40 years) ( Raab 2009 ).
MM is the second most common hematological malignancy (after no n-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma), representing 1% of all cancers and 2% of all cancer deaths. With current 
therapy, median survival is 5.2 years after diagnosis ( Kumar 2014 ).
Although the cause of MM is unknown, a number of mutated genes have been found with 
significant frequency in patients with MM. These include mutati ons in NRAS, KRAS, TP53 
and BRAF, which are well known onc ogenic drivers for other cancers ( Lohr 2014 ) and 
mutations in many genes associated with NFκB activation ( Keats 2007 ). Also, certain risk 
factors make patients more susceptible to the disease. MM is mo re common in individuals 
over the age of 65, in males, and in those with family members affected by [INVESTIGATOR_224673]. Fifty 
percent (50%) of patients with MM harbor mutations in the immun oglobulin heavy-chain 
locus on chromosome 14q32, partia l or complete loss of chromosome 13, and partial loss of 
chromosome 17 ( Raab 2009 ;Kyle 2004 ).
The diagnosis of MM is based on the key characteristics of the disease, occupation of the 
bone marrow cavity, the presence of space occupying bone lesion s, and the production of 
paraprotein ( Raab 2009 ;IMWG 2003 ). The staging of MM is based on β 2-microglobulin 
level, which is directly correlated to renal function, tumor ma ss, and albumin level 
(Greipp 2005). The stages are summarized in Appendix 2.
Selinexor (KPT-330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_728970] 20 years due to th e use of high-dose 
chemotherapy (i.e., alkylating agents) and autologous stem cell  transplantation, the 
introduction of immunomodulatory agents, such as thalidomide, l enalidomide, and 
pomalidomide, and the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and car filzomib. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_555229], most patients deve lop highly resistant MM and 
succumb to the disease. With over 12,500 deaths from MM expecte d in the [LOCATION_003] in 2016 
(ACS 2016 ), there remains a high unmet medical need to develop anti-MM a gents with novel 
mechanisms.  
3. NUCLEAR EXPORT 
3.1. Inhibition of XPO1 in Human Cancer 
Many important tumor suppressing proteins (TSPs) have been iden tified in cancer 
pathogenesis, including but not limited to TP53, FOXO3a, IκB, B RCA1, APC, PP2A, and 
Rb (Turner 2012 ; Senapedis 2014 ; Tan 2014 ; Yang 2014 ). TSPs mediate tumor suppression 
pathways via various functions including recognition of cellula r damage, arrest of the cell 
cycle until repairs can be made, and induction of apoptosis in cells that are beyond repair  
(Brown 2011 ). Similarly, glucocorticoid binding to, and nuclear localizati on of, the GCR is 
required for its signaling.  
The tumor suppression and anti-cancer activity of these TSPs an d the GCR requires their 
presence in the nucleus. Conversely, export to the cytoplasm by  [CONTACT_555259]1 can inactivate their abilities to regulate cellula r processes ( Xu 2010 ) and 
cancer cells exploit these func tions to successfully evade norm al DNA-damage controls as 
well as anti-neoplastic therapy. XPO1 is the only known nuclear  export protein for the vast 
majority of TSPs and the GCR. Of no te, XPO1 has been identified  as a selective survival 
gene in MM by [CONTACT_555260]-throughput short interfering ribonu cleic acid (siRNA) 
screening ( Tiedemann 2012 ) and is commonly overexpressed in MM ( Tai 2014 ).  
XPO1 blockade causes transient nuclear retention of TSPs, the G CR, and other growth 
modulators, re-establishing their tumor suppressing and growth regulating effects on cancer 
cells and potentially reversing mechanisms leading to chemother apy resistance (which holds 
possible future implications  for combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) ( Lain 1999 ).  
Certain growth-promoting (incl uding oncogene) messenger RNAs (m RNAs) require 
specialized nuclear export via a “cap -binding complex” in order to exit the nucleus into the 
cytoplasm where they are translated into proteins ( Culjkovic  2013; Koehler 2007 ). Several 
key MM genes including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, hDM2 and others utiliz e this complex via 
binding to the protein eIF4E in order to exit the nucleus and u ndergo efficient translation into 
protein. The cap-binding complex protein eIF4E is exported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm exclusively by [CONTACT_67990]1. As these proteins tend to have v ery short half-lives, 
constant translation is required t o maintain their cellular lev els. Inhibition of XPO1-mediated 
nuclear export leads to reduced translation of these growth-pro moting proteins, and 
subsequently significant drops in their levels. 
In normal cells, XPO1 inhibition transiently arrests the cell cycle without cytotoxicity 
followed by [CONTACT_555261] r the inhibitor is removed ( Lain 1999 ; van der Watt 2009 ; Gray 
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 342007). Several attempts to develop this class of anti-cancer drug ha ve failed due to off-target 
effects of the drugs which led to significant weight loss, diar rhea, and marked fatigue and 
asthenia in the early clinical trials ( Mutka 2009 ;Newlands 1996 ;Roberts 1986) .
It is now well recognized that forced nuclear retention of TSPs can counteract a multitude of 
oncogenic, growth stimulatory (and inflammatory) pathways that perpetuate the neoplastic 
phenotype. Similarly, nuclear retention of the GR in the presen ce of glucocorticoids could 
restore its activity. Finally, inhibition of eIF4E/XPO1-mediate d mRNA export of 
oncoproteins lead to reductions in their levels. Because restor ation of TSP ± GR activity and 
reduction in oncogenic signals are relevant to essentially any cancer, XPO1 inhibition is 
expected to have activity against MM and many other malignancie s (Table 2 ).

4. SELINEXOR (KPT-330)
4.1. Introduction
Selinexor is an oral, first-in-class, slowly reversible, potent selective inhibitor of nuclear 
export (SINE) compound that specifically blocks exportin 1 (XPO 1). XPO1 is responsible 
for the unidirectional export of ~220 different cargo proteins from the nucleus to the 
cytoplasm ( Xu et al., 2010 ). The anti-neoplastic activi ty of SINE compounds is mediated 
Selinexor (KPT-330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_728971] pathways involving tumor suppre ssor proteins (TSPs), 
oncoproteins, and the glucocorticoid receptor. First, SINE compounds induce nuclear 
localization and functional activa tion of multiple TSPs, leading to rapid apoptosis of multiple 
myeloma (MM) ( Tai et al., 2014 ) and other malignant cells. By [CONTACT_555262], all cell types exposed to SINE compounds undergo G1 ± 
G2 cell cycle arrest, followe d by a ‘genomic fidelity’ review . Cells with genomic damage (ie , 
malignant cells) are induced to undergo apoptosis both in vitro  and in vivo. Normal cells, 
with an intact genome, remain in transient, reversible cell cycle arrest until the XPO1 block is relieved. A second anti-neoplastic effect of SINE compounds is mediated through the 
mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E, which is also an XPO1 cargo. Am ongst other functions, 
eIF4E is responsible for the e fficient nuclear export and deliv ery of several growth-
promoting (oncoprotein) mRNAs to cytoplasmic ribosomal for tran slation. By [CONTACT_555263]43 bound to XPO1, SINE compounds re duce the cytoplasmic 
ribosomal synthesis of oncoprotein mRNAs including c-Myc, hDM2,  Cyclin D1 and Bcl-
XL. Finally, SINE compounds also lead to restoration of anti-my eloma glucocorticoid 
receptor (GR) signaling in the presence of glucocorticoids; selinexor and other SINE 
compounds do not appear to exacerbate  the hyperglycemic effects  of glucocorticoids.  Thus, 
by [CONTACT_555264]/cytoplasmic control protein XPO1,  SINE compounds exhibit 
broad and deep anti-cancer activities. 
4.2. Preclinical Data 
In this section, a brief summary of preclinical data is provided. Additional information is 
presented in the current Selinexor/KPT- 330 Investigator’s Brochure . 
In vitro  experiments with continuous (~72 hour) exposure to selinexor d emonstrated potent 
pro-apoptotic activity across a  broad panel of tumor-derived ce ll lines and patient samples in 
culture, including multidrug-resistant cancers. Moreover, selin exor demonstrated cytotoxicity 
in MM and CLL cells in the absence or presence of bone marrow s troma cells (BMSC).  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies w ere conducted in mice, rats and monkeys. Selinexor showed 
dose proportional exposure with no accumulation. Please see the  current 
Selinexor/KPT-330 Investigator’s Brochure for more information. 
Several studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of SINE c ompounds on MM in vivo . In 
MM1.S xenograft tumors, treatment with the SINE compound KPT-27 6 showed a marked 
decreased in tumor volume (40%) whe reas tumor volume increased by 36% with placebo 
(Schmidt 2013 ). KPT-276 was also active in the Vk*MYC mouse model of MM, whi ch has a 
positive predictive value of 67% for the activity of single-agent compounds in clinical trials 
(Schmidt 2013 ; Chesi 2012 ).  
4.2.1. Selinexor plus Dexamethasone Combination Studies 
In vitro  studies showed selinexor and dexamethasone in combination were found to have a 
synergistic effect on reducing MM1.S human MM cell viability re lative to either drug alone 
(Chen 2014). Increased GR nuclear localization and concomitantly activated GCR-mediated 
transcription in the presence of glucocorticoids were at least partly responsible for the 
synergistic cytotoxicity of this combination. ( Gao 2014). 
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 36Enhanced activity of the selinexor plus dexamethasone combination was also observed in 
two xenograft models of human MM. The addition of dexamethasone  to selinexor enhanced 
activity (86%) relative to selinexor alone. 
In summary, the combination of selinexor and dexamethasone is s ynergistic in vitro and 
in vivo in MM cell cytotoxicity assays through increased nuclear localization of GCR and 
amplified GCR transcriptional activity. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that SINE 
compounds are active anti-MM co mpounds that cause decreased cel l viability, increased 
apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in vitro and potent inhibition of MM tumor growth in vivo ,
and that the addition of dexamethas one can augment these effect s.
4.3. Clinical Experience

[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary 
Based on the promising preliminary efficacy results described a bove and on the considered 
feedback from MM experts that the population of patients with p enta-refractory MM 
represents a current and growing high unmet medical need where there are no approved 
agents and there is no established standard of care, Karyopharm is expanding the number of 
patients with penta-refractory  MM enrolled in this single-arm study to a total of 
~160 patients with penta-refractory MM to receive Sd twice week ly for every week of each 
four-week cycle (8 doses/cycle). 
4.4. Potential Risks 
Selinexor is currently in clinical development and has not been  approved by [CONTACT_555267]. Over 2,[ADDRESS_728977] received selinexor (as  of 31 March 2017), however 
the entire safety profile is not known at this time. Measures will be taken to ensure the safety 
of the patients participating in this trial, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and close monitoring.  
If toxicities are encountered, adjustments will be made to the study treatment as detailed in 
the sections that follow. All A Es and serious adverse events (S AEs) will be recorded during 
the trial and for up to [ADDRESS_728978] common AEs possibly related to 
selinexor are anorexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an d thrombocytopenia. Virtually 
all of these side effects can be managed effectively with dose modification and/or supportive care initiated prior to first dosing. Overall, the most frequen tly observed laboratory 
abnormalities include thrombocyt openia, hyponatremia, and a dec rease in red blood cells. 
The majority of these have been mild to moderate. Please refer to the current 
Selinexor/KPT- 330 Investigator’s Brochure  for more information.  
Acute cerebellar syndrome (ACS) was reported at high doses in o ne adult (85 mg/m
2) and 
two pediatric (70 mg/m2) patients in two phase 1 studies.  The maximum doses in adults  
(70 mg/m2) and children (55 mg/m2) have been established large ly based on these events.  An 
adult patient, heavily pre-treated for recurrent pancreatic can cer, developed ACS following 
3 doses of selinexor at 85 mg/m2 twice weekly. The patient expe rienced abnormal speech, 
loss of coordination, and was unable to walk. Selinexor was dis continued and the patient’s 
symptoms resolved to near baseline by ~6 weeks.  A five-year ol d with refractory AML 
developed ACS following 4 doses of selinexor (70 mg/m2) followed by 5 days of fludarabine 
and cytarabine (without intrathrecal therapy). The patient was empi[INVESTIGATOR_555231] 5 days, improved significantly o ver the next 3 weeks, and

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 4045 mg/m2(~80 mg) plus dexamethasone 20 mg, both dosed twice weekly, exp erienced 
durable response without clinically relevant cumulative toxicities. (See Section 4.3.)
Patients in the present study will receive selinexor 80 mg (45 m g/m2BSA) plus 
dexamethasone 20 mg, both dosed tw ice weekly, for each week of four-week cycles.
Dexamethasone 20 mg will be given with each dose of selinexor. For patients with partial 
intolerance to glucocorticoids (as determined by [CONTACT_148606]) a minimum dose of 
dexamethasone [ADDRESS_728979] cases (e.g., for patients showing SD or PR and tolera ting treatment particularly 
well), the selinexor dose may be increased by 20 mg to 100 mg, based on efficacy and safety 
considerations, after a minimum of two cycles of study therapy.  However, in no case may the 
dose for any patient exceed 70 mg/m2. Prior to any potential dose increase, the BSA for the 
patient should be calculated. Patients with BSA < 1.[ADDRESS_728980] their dose increased, 
as this would result in a dose > 70 mg/m2selinexor.
6. STUDY OBJECTIVES
6.1. Primary Objectives
Evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate [ORR]) for treatme nt with selinexor 80 mg plus 
low-dose dexamethasone (20 mg) (Sd) twice weekly (four-week cyc les) in patients with MM 
previously treated with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib,  carfilzomib, and 
daratumumab; and refractory to prior treatment with glucocortic oids, an immunomodulatory 
agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and the anti-CD38 mA b daratumumab (herein 
referr ed to as “ penta-refractory ” MM).
ORR will include patients who experience partial response (PR), very good partial response 
(VGPR), complete response (CR), or s tringent complete response (sCR), based on 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria ( Kumar 2016 ) for patients 
with penta-refractory MM in Part 2 (expansion phase).
6.2. Secondary Objectives
The following endpoints will be analyzed separately for (a) Part 1 patients with quad-
refractory MM, (b) Part 1 patients with penta-refractory MM, an d (c) Part 2 (expansion) 
patients with penta-refractory MM. Additionally, analyses of sa fety and tolerability will be 
performed on the overall population of patients from Parts [ADDRESS_728981] one
dose of study treatment.
xDuration of response (DOR = Durat ion from first observation of at least PR to 
time of disease progression, or death due to disease progressio n, whichever occurs 
first. DOR will be censored for death due to any causes other t han disease 
progression)

7. STUDY DESIGN 
7.1. Overview 
This is a Phase 2b, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study o f Sd (selinexor 80 mg plus 
dexamethasone 20 mg), both dosed twice weekly, four weeks of ea ch four-week cycle, in 
patients with MM previously treated with lenalidomide, pomalido mide, bortezomib, 
carfilzomib, and daratumumab, and refractory to prior treatment  with glucocorticoids, an 
immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and  the anti-CD38 mAb 
daratumumab. (Note: Refractory is defined as ≤  25% response to therapy, progression during 
the previously described therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or progression within 60 days after completion of 
therapy.) 
This study consists of two parts and will enroll approximately 210 patients overall. Part 1 
(protocol V1.0-3.0) enrolled patients with both quad-refractory  MM and penta-refractory 
MM. Part 2 (protocol V≥4.0) will enroll patients with penta-refractory MM only, but 
continue all patients  enrolled in Part 1.  
The population for the primary efficacy analysis will contain only patients with penta-
refractory MM enrolled in Part 2. E fficacy results for patients  with quad-refractory MM and 
patients with penta-refractory MM enrolled in Part 1 will be an alyzed separately. Safety 
analyses will be performed on the overall population of patients who received any amount of study treatment, presented overa ll and by [CONTACT_16051], and separ ately for Part 1 penta-
refractory MM patients and quad-refractory MM patients. 
Patients will receive selinexor 80 mg (45 mg/m
2 BSA) plus dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd), both 
dosed twice weekly, for each wee k of four-week cycles. Patients  will receive treatment until 
PD, death, toxicity that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_555252], or  withdrawal, whichever 
occurs first.  
Patients will also receive best supportive care to mitigate sel inexor side effects, including 
blood product transfusions, antimicrobials, and (as appropriate) growth factors including 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factors for neutropenia, erythropoietins for anemia, and/or platelet-stimulating factors for thrombocytopenia. 
In select cases (e.g., for patients showing SD or PR and tolera ting treatment particularly 
well), the selinexor dose may be increased by 20 mg after consu ltation with the Medical 
Monitor. The dose level for an individual patient may be escala ted based on efficacy 
considerations only after a minimum of 2 cycles of study therap y. However, in no case may 
the dose for any patient exceed 70 mg/m
2. Prior to any potential dose increase, the body 
surface area (BSA) for the patient will be calculated and an in dividual patient’s dose may not 
be increased if it would result in a dose > 70 mg/m2. 
In Part 2, MM-specific assessments (i.e., SPEP, UPEP, serum/uri ne immunofixation, 
quantitative Ig levels, serum FLC, and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) mu st be confirmed by a central 
laboratory to confirm CR or sCR, and select VGPR, per IMWG. Additional information is 
provided in the Study Manual .

treatment and record this information on the electronic case re port form (eCRF). Patients 
who are prematurely withdrawn from study treatment are not elig ible to re-initiate study 
treatment on this protocol at a later date.
7.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent Data Safety Monit oring Board (DSMB) will review the safety of study 
treatment and any SAEs that occur during the study. Details on how the DSMB will review 
safety and response data are provided in the DSMB Charter .
The DSMB will be comprised of a minimum of two oncologists (at least one of whom 
specializes in hematologic oncology) and a statistician. Follow ing their initial meeting, 
DSMB meetings will occur on a periodic basis in accordance with  their charter. 
7.3. Independent Review Committee
An Independent Review Committee (IRC), will review disease assessment data to 
independently assess disease response. The IRC will review data  that will be used for the 
analysis of the primary endpoint. The IRC’s assessments of disease response and time to 
progression (TTP) will be used as the basis for the evaluation of the primary endpoint.  
The IRC membership, functioning, and procedures (including reso lution of any 
disagreements with Investigators regarding disease assessments) will be described in the 
IRC Charter .
7.4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_555232] i ndividual patients may be stop ped under defined 
circumstances as outlined in Section 10.
7.5. Study Endpoints
Study objectives and endpoints are provided in Section 6.
7.6. Blinding and Randomization
Not applicable; this is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study. 
7.7. End of Study
The End of Study (EoS) will occur when all patients have completed the one-year Follow-up
Period (i.e., when the last patient has expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], been followed for [ADDRESS_728983]).

forms (eCRFs). Screen failures will be replaced. Screen failure s may be re-screened. 
8.7. Study Patient Numbers 
Each patient will be assigned a  unique study number and will ke ep this number for the 
duration of the study. Patient numbers will not be reassigned o r reused for any reason. 
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.

8.8. Study Patient Number
Each patient will be assigned a  unique study number and will ke ep this number for the 
duration of the study. Patient numbers will not be reassigned o r reused for any reason. 
Patients will be identified to Karyopharm only by [CONTACT_555268] d number, initials, year of
birth (as allowed by [CONTACT_555269]),  and sex. The Investigator must 
maintain a patient identification master log.
9. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT AND ENDPOINTS
9.1. Standard Study Assessments
All assessments should be performed as outlined in Table 1.
9.1.1. Demographic Data
During Screening, patient demographic data will be collected. These  data include year of
birth, age, gender, race, and ethnicity.
9.1.2. Medical History
A complete medical history w ill be obtained from each patient. M edical history includes 
historic MM assessment values (Day -30 and Day -60), baseline sy mptoms as well as a 
detailed history of prior procedures for MM and other prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e., transplant, 
chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, biotherapy, radi otherapy, and surgery)
including start and stop dates, be st response, disease progression dates (during or after 
therapy), as well as disconti nuations due to intolerability or toxicity. Smoking history will be 
recorded. Data should be reviewed by [CONTACT_555270] [ADDRESS_728990] taken any medication other than the study 
medication (from Screening through the end of the study). All c oncomitant medications 
including dietary supplements, over-the-counter medications, an d oral herbal preparations, as 
well as changes in medication, will be recorded on the eCRFs. 
Supportive care (such a s appetite stimulants , anti-emetics, and  anti-diarrheals, etc.) is 
encouraged (see Section 11.4.2).
9.1.4. Physical Examination 
Full physical examinations (PE) during Screening and the EoT Vi sit will be performed. All 
other PEs during the study should be symptom-directed PEs. Sign ificant findings that were 
present prior to the signing of informed consent must be included on the medical history page 
on the patient’s CRF. Significant new findings, including the p resence of plasmacytomas, 
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_728991] be recorded on the Adverse Event or 
Plasmacytoma page of the patient’s CRF.
PEs, unless otherwise noted, will include the following:
xHeight (without shoes) in centimeters (cm) measured during Screening only 
xBody weight (indoor clothing without shoes) in kilograms (kg) 
xBody temperature 
xSystolic and diastolic BP and pulse rate measured at each visit  after the patient 
has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_159353] [ADDRESS_728992] be recorded on the AE eCRF.
9.1.5. ECOG Score
An ECOG Score Assessment (see Appendix 1) will be performed during Screening, Day 1 of 
each cycle, and the EoT visit.
9.2. Multiple Myeloma Disease Specific Assessments
Patient response will be assessed by [CONTACT_555271] T able 4 and graded 
according to the IMWG response criteria summarized in Table 10 (Appendix 3). Per IMWG, 
quantitative Ig levels by [CONTACT_159446] M-protein 
measurements for patients with
 IgA or IgD myeloma. Also, per IMWG, response may be 
confirmed if the patient fails to provide 24-hour urine sample collection after Screening 
activities occur.  All MM assessments outlined in this protocol ar e  required to be performed at 
each study visit, prior to dosing. If MM assessments are collected at unscheduled times, those 
results must be documented in the eCRF as unscheduled visits. Th is includes SPEP, UPEP, 
serum FLC, β 2
 microglobulin, quantitative I g, and serum/urine protein immunofixation. 
Results of pre-screening MM assessments at Day -30 (window: Screening – 2 weeks) and 
Day
 -60 (±15 days) will also be provided.
SPEP with serum protein immunofixation, quantitative Ig, serum FLC, and 24-hour UPEP, 
with immunofixation, must be collected at each required time po int. An aliquot of the blood 
and urine samples should be retain ed.  If the local laboratory results indicate a CR or sCR, 
sequential MM disease assessment samples, per IMWG, will be col lected. The sequential 
samples will be split –one aliquot of each sample will be s ent to the local lab while the other 
aliquots, along with the initial assessment aliquots, will be se nt to the central laboratory to 
confirm CR or sCR. If the resu lts do not indicate CR or sCR, the n the aliquots may be 
destroyed. Refer to the Study Manual for details.
All disease assessments (SPEP, UPEP, FLC, quantitative Ig, and serum/urine protein 
immunofixation) should be performe d regardless of the diagnosis  that is being followed (e.g., 
[ADDRESS_728993] be collected at each time point ou tlined in the protocol even if 
the patient is being followed by [CONTACT_64827], Ig or FLC).

Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_728994] 5 minutes prior to the ECG recording. The Investigator will interpret the ECG using one 
of the following categories: normal, abnormal but not clinicall y significant, or abnormal and 
clinically significant. The date and time the ECG was performed  and the following 
parameters will be recorded in the eCRF: heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, QRS interval, 
and QT corrected (QTc) using Bazett’s formula or calculated by [CONTACT_148997] ( Bazett 1920, Fridericia 1920 ). If Bazett correction is entered by [CONTACT_779], the 
Fridericia corrected QTc inte rval (QTcF) will be derived using the formula: QT/(RR^[1/3]), 
where RR = 60/heart rate.
9.4.2. Ophthalmic Exam
A full ophthalmic examination w ill be performed prior to the pa tient's first dose of selinexor. 
Prior to dilation, best corrected visual acuity (Snellen’s Equivalent based on either Snellen 
chart or ETDRS chart), slit la mp examination including tonometr y, following dilation, and 
fundoscopy. If a cataract is seen during the examination, the cataract will be graded as 
follows:
xLens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) –Patients who enrolled in 
this study under the original P rotocol or Protocol Amendments [ADDRESS_728995] 
been detected to date, if catarac ts are detected, they will be graded according to 
the Grade 1-4 scale.
xAmerican Optometric Association (AOA) Cataract Grading System –Starting 
with Protocol Amendment 3, new patients will be evaluated using  the AOA 
grading system until they complete the study. This system is modified from the Optometric Clinical Practice Guideline: Care of the Adult Patie nt with Cataract, 
which is available on the AOA website ( www.aoa.org )(See Appendix 5.)
9.4.3. Clinical Laboratory Assessments
The following clinical laboratory tests should be performed as indicated in Table 1.
xHematology (blood sample: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]) tests 
including hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean  corpuscular 
hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white bl ood cell 
(WBC) count, WBC differential, red blood cell count, lymphocyte s, monocytes, 
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets. WBC differe ntial may be 
automated or manual as per institutional standards.

Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 5811.1.4. Dose Modifications for Patients with VGPR
In an effort to improve long-term disease control and tolerability, this protocol allows for 
dose reductions in patients with very good anti-tumor activity of selinexor. Thus, for patients 
who achieve ≥ VGPR for ≥ 6 mont hs and who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_555235](s), the following modifications may be cons idered: (a) The dose of 
dexamethasone may be reduced by 40% or (b) the dose of selinexo r may be reduced by 
20 mg or (c) the frequency of selinexor may be reduced to once wee kly, after consultation 
with the Medical Monitor. In general, dexamethasone should always be given on the day(s) of selinexor dosing. Patients whose doses are reduced under thi s schema should have 
appropriate MM markers monitored a t least every two weeks (e.g. , with FLC) so that dose 
may be re-escalated to their initial dose if evidence of progre ssion occurs. These monitoring 
studies may be done at local laboratories. 
11.1.5. Dose Reduction Guidelines for Toxicity
Toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE v.4.03 criteria; the  therapy modifications 
described below are applied according to this severity grading.
If more than one type of toxicity occurs concurrently, the most  severe grade will determine 
the modification.
Re-escalation of the study dru g is allowed as outlined in the s ections that apply for the 
specific toxicity. If drug-related toxicity requires a treatmen t delay of more than [ADDRESS_728996] be documented in the eCRF, including the 
respective reason.
Based on observations from the ongoing Phase 1 studies in patie nts with advanced 
hematological and solid tumors, selinexor shows a reasonably wi de therapeutic range, with 
activities from ~6 mg/m
2to ≥60 mg/m2. Therefore, in order to optimiz e specific anti-tumor 
activity and the patient’s tolerability, dose reductions and/or schedule modifications will be 
allowed as described in Table 5 andTable 6. Patients should also be tre ated aggressively with 
supportive care to reduce toxicities.
For all Grade ≥3 hematological or non-hematological AEs that are NOT selinexor related, 
after consultation with the Medical Monitor and at the discretion of the Investigator, 
selinexor  dosing may be maintained, provided that the patient can continu e to take the agent 
by [CONTACT_1966].

Table 6: Supportive Care and Dose Adjustment Guidelines 
Please note the following recommendations:
xAfter consultation with the Medical Monitor and at the discreti on of the 
Investigator, selinexor dosing may be maintained for all hematol ogical or non-
hematological AEs that are NOT related to selinexor.
xFor all selinexor-related AEs, if the prescribed dose reduction s/interruptions in
Table 8 result in a stabilization of ≥ 4 weeks, a re -escalation may be considered 
after approval from the Medical Monitor.
Toxicity and Intensity Selinexor Dose Modification
Fatigue (common)
Grade 1 or

anemia.  If found to be anemic, consider transfusing for hemogl obin < 8 g/dL. 
Institute supportive care medica tions per institutional guideli nes and NCCN 
CPGO.
Patients with significant fatigue after several doses of seline xor may have an 
ongoing anti -tumor response.  If fatigue is significant, consider assessment  of 
tumor response as part of the patient’s evaluation.
Grade 2 lasting > 7 days or
Grade 3Rule out other causes of fatigue, particularly dehydration and anemia.  If found 
to be anemic, consider transfusin g for hemoglobin < 8 g/dL. Ins titute 
supportive care medications per ins titutional guidelines and NC CN CPGO.

Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_728998] treatment plan, and required 5-HT3 prophylaxis 
(Section 11.4.1), supportive care including anti-nausea/anti-emetic therapy, a cid suppression 
(proton pump inhibitors [PPI] and/or H2-blockers) and other tre atments may be administered 
as described below:
xAppetite stimulants: megester ol acetate at a dose of 80-400 mg daily. 
xCentrally acting agents: per Nati onal Comprehensive Cancer Netw ork®[NCCN] 
Clinical Practice Guidelines®for antiemesis and anorexia/cachexia [palliative 
care])
xNeurokinin [ADDRESS_728999] (NK1R antagonist): aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] o r equivalent 
should be considered and will be covered for selected patients who have severe 
nausea and vomiting.
11.4.3. lnfection
Appropriate broad-spectrum intrav enous antibiotics and antifunga l agents should be started 
immediately in patients who develop fever or other signs of sys temic infection. Selinexor 
should be suspended in any patient with Grade 4 infection or cli nical sepsis (in the absence of 
documented infection) until the c ondition is stabilized. Seline xor can then be re-started at the 
same dose.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Glucocorticoid Side Effects
The management of common glucocorticoid side effects is well do cumented. Aggressive use 
of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), anti-hypertensives and other agents is strongly encouraged 
in order to maintain the use of dexamethasone in combination wi th selinexor in this study.
Patients with documented osteopenia or osteoporosis should continue to take dexamethasonewith selinexor as indicated in the study. Standard precautions such as use of bisphosphonates should be instituted unless contraindicated.
11.4.4. Concomitant Medication and Treatment
Concomitant medication is defi ned as any prescription or over-t he-counter preparation, 
including vitamins, dietary supplements, over-the-counter medic ations, and oral herbal 
preparations. Patients may conti nue their baseline medication(s ). All concomitant 
medication(s) must be reported in the eCRF. Any diagnostic, the rapeutic, or surgical 
procedure performed during the study period should be recorded,  including the dates, 
description of the procedure(s), and any clinical findings, if applicable. 
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_729000] care. Medica tions to treat concomitant 
diseases like diabetes, hypertension, etc., are allowed.
11.4.5. Restricted Medications 
Medications: Although acetaminophen (paracetamol) use in combination with se linexor 
was restricted in previous selinexor studies based on theoretic al interactions 
with glutathione (GSH), ongoing clinical safety evaluations on the use of 
these drugs together have not shown any significant clinical or laboratory 
abnormalities with doses of acetaminophen up to 1 gram and seli nexor up to 
55 mg/m2(approximately 80-100 mg). Therefore, there are no longer any 
restrictions on the use of acetami nophen or acetaminophen-conta ining 
products in combination with selinexor, EXCEPT on days of selin exor 
dosing, when acetaminophen must not exceed a total daily dose o f 1 gram.
Diet: There are no dietary restrictions on this study. Patients should maintain adequate caloric and fluid intake.
11.4.6. Prohibited Medications
Concurrent 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: Concurrent therapy with any non-study anticancer therapeutic is  not 
allowed. Other investigational agents should not be used during  the study. 
Use of any immunosuppressive agents during the study must be co nfirmed 
by [CONTACT_1689]. 
.
Medications: Patients should not take glutathione (GSH)-, S-adenosylmethioni ne (SAM)-,
or N-acetylcysteine (NAC)-containing products during this study  as these 
products may enhance the metabolism of selinexor. Please see Appendix [ADDRESS_729001] agree to use 2 methods of 
contraception (1 highly effectiv e and 1 effective) and have a ne gative serum pregnancy test at 
Screening, and male patients must use an effective barrier meth od of contraception if 
sexually active with a female of childbearing potential. 
Highly effective methods include: 
1. Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., c ombined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring,

Effective methods include: 
1. Barrier methods of contracep tion (e.g., male condom, female c ondom, cervical cap, 
diaphragm, and contraceptive sponge)
Of particular note,
xNo barrier method by [CONTACT_555273] a highly effective standar d of contraception
xThe proper use of diaphragm or cervi cal cap includes use of spe rmicide and is 
considered 1 barrier method.
xThe cervical cap and contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women.
xThe use of spermicide alone is not considered a suitable barrie r method for 
contraception.
xA combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with 
spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered accepta ble (i.e., 
effective), but not highly effective, birth control methods.
xMale and female condoms should not be used together as they can  tear or become 
damaged.
Alternatively, the following fulfill the contraception requirem ents:
1. A sexual partner who is permanently surgically sterilized or post-menopausal.
2. Total (true) abstinence (whe n this is in line with the prefer red and usual lifestyle of 
the patient) is an acceptable method of contraception. Note: Pe riodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and post-ovulation methods)  and withdrawal are 
not acceptable methods of contraception.
The methods of acceptable contraception must be explained to bo th male and female 
potential patients. In order to be eligible for the study, patients must agree to use the methods 
of birth control described above throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_729002] 
dose of study treatment at the time of consent for the study.
Please see Section 4.4.1 for additional safety information related to pregnancy.
11.4.8. Radiation Treatment
If clinically indicated, palliative radiation therapy to non-ta rget lesions is permitted but study 
drug should be held for ≥ 1 day before the start of palliative radiation therapy and ≥ [ADDRESS_729003] the patient on study medication self-administration.
Selinexor (KPT-330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_729004] regardless of a caus al relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable sign and unin tended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. 
Any treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result or test resul t (e.g., PE, ECG, Echo, 
vitals, etc.), which is clinically significant, (i.e., meets on e or more of the conditions listed 
below), should be recorded as a single diagnosis on the AE page  in the eCRF:  
1. Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
2. Leading to a change in study medication (e.g., dose modificatio n, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
3. Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g., addition of, i nterruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medica tion, therapy or 
treatment) 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AE s that occur during the study. 
AE information will be elicited by [CONTACT_99020] a non-lea ding question, for example, 
“Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last  asked/since your last 
visit?” AEs should b e reported on the appropri ate page of the eCRF. 
AEs should be reported for thei r actual grade and duration. 
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; t he event itself could be of 
relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ he adache). This is not the same as 
“serious.”  Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome of an AE and usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  
The severity of the AE will be graded according to the CTCAE Gr ading Scale (see the 
CTCAE web page at http://ctep.cancer.gov  for details). For AEs not covered by [CONTACT_3989], the 
severity will be characterized as “mild,” “ moderat e,” or “severe” according to the following 
definitions: 
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 70xMild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s daily 
activities.
xModerate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or conce rn to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities.
xSevere events interrupt  the patient’s usual daily activities.
The Investigator will make a judgment regarding the AE’s r elationship to study drug, as
outlined below in Table 7.
Table 7: Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_555274] a temporal relationship of the event to study treat ment makes a 
causal r elationship not reasonably possi ble, or by [CONTACT_479583], 
therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions that provide  a sufficient 
explanation.
Related The temporal relationship of the event to study treatment makes  a definitive 
relationship, and the event is more likely explained by [CONTACT_555275] e to the study 
treatment than by [CONTACT_479583], therapeutic interventions or underlying 
conditions.
12.1. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose 
(including after the ICF is signed and prior to dosing) that:
xResults in death
xIs life-threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death from  the event as it 
occurred)
xRequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (formal admission to a hosp ital for medical 
reasons) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555237]/incapacity
xResults in a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on a ppropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medic al or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examp les of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring i ntensive treatment in an emerg ency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_555238] s that are not related to a 
treatment-emergent AE are not considered SAEs.
Selinexor (KPT-330) Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 71Progression of the malignancy (including fatal outcomes) should  not be reported as an SAE 
during the study or within the safety reporting period (see bel ow). Sudden and unexplained 
death should be reported as an SAE.
12.1.1. AE and SAE Follow-up
All AEs occurring during the study are to be followed up in acc ordance with good medical 
practice until they are resolved, stabilized or judged no longe r clinically significant or, if a 
chronic condition, until fully characterized. Any AEs that are considered drug-related must 
be followed until resolution or until stabilization. 
12.1.2. Post-Study Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
All unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_555276], the 
patient is lost to follow-up, or the AE is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled visit, the 
Investigator should instruct each patient to report any subsequ ent event(s) that the patient, or 
the patient ’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this 
study.
Prior to the conclusion of the study at the site, the Investiga tor should notify the Karyopharm 
Pharmacovigilance Department (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) of any death or AE occurring at any 
time after a patient has discontinued or terminated study parti cipation that may reasonably be 
related to this study. 
After study conclusion, the Investigator should notify Karyopha rm Therapeutics Inc., or its 
designee, of any death or AE he or she is aware of occurring at  any time after a patient has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasona bly be related to this study. 
Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. should also be notified if the Inv estigator should become 
aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly i n a subsequently conceived 
offspring of a patient that has participated in this study.
12.1.3. Serious Adverse Event Reporting
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Requirements
ALL SAEs occurring in any patient, must be reported to the Kary opharm Pharmacovigilance 
Department within [ADDRESS_729005] knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_555239]. The following information will be requ ested from the investigational 
site:
xProtocol number
xSite and/or investigator number
xPatient number
xDemographic data
xBrief description of the event
xOnset date and time
xResolution date and time, if the event resolved

Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be collecte d and reported to the 
competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with the FDA’s “Safety 
Reporting Requirements for Investig ational New Drugs and Bioana lytical/Bioequivalence 
Studies” or as per national regu latory requirements in participating countries.
All investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies wit h the study medication will 
receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_555240] 
(IRB) or Ethics committee (EC), as applicable. Reporting of SAE s by [CONTACT_555277] g procedures and policies of 
the IRB/EC. Adequate documentation must be maintained showing that the IRB/EC was 
properly notified.
In addition, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. will communicate all cases of cerebellar toxicities 
of Grade 3 or higher to the regulatory authority, IRBs and inve stigators, in the format of an 
expedited Safety Report within 7 days of awareness of the event .
12.2. Overdose
An overdose is defined as a deliberate or accidental administra tion of study medication to a 
study patient at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual patient according to the 
study protocol. In the event of drug overdose, the Investigator  and Karyopharm Medical 
Monitor should be notified immediately and the patient observed  closely for AEs. The patient 
should be treated symptomaticall y as appropriate, and the incid ent of overdose and related 
AEs and/or treatment documented in the patient's medical record . In addition to documenting 
the overdose in the patient's records, the overdose must be rep orted to Karyopharm 
Pharmacovigilance on an SAE  report form.  Any AE or SAE observe d as a consequence of 
the overdose will be handled as described in Section 12.2, as appropriate.
As selinexor is metabolized by [CONTACT_555278] ,it is conceivable that hepatic GSH 
depletion can occur in case of ov erdose. Therefore, in patients who develop liver function 
test abnormalities, supportive measures such as SAM [ADDRESS_729006] GSH, should be considered.

Sponsor within 24 hours of learning  of its occurrence. The preg nancy should be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, 
and the presence or absence of a ny birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications. Follow -up and documentation must occur e ven if the patient 
withdraws from the study or the study is completed.  
The avoidance of fathering a c hild is recommended for [ADDRESS_729008]-study should be reported to the study investigator and 
the sponsor’s designee.  
13. STATISTICAL METHODS 
13.1. General Considerations 
13.1.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
This is a Phase 2b, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study o f selinexor 80 mg with 
dexamethasone 20 mg (Sd), both given orally twice weekly for ea ch week of four-week 
cycles, to patients with MM previously treated with lenalidomid e, pomalidomide, 
bortezomib, carfilzomib, and daratumumab, and refractory to pri or treatment with 
glucocorticoids, an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome  inhibitor (PI), and the 
anti-CD38 mAb daratumumab.  
This study consists of two parts and will enroll approximately 210 patients overall. Part 1 
(protocol V1-3) enrolled patients with both penta-refractory MM and quad-refractory MM. 
Part 2 (protocol V≥4.0) will enroll patients with penta -refractory MM only, but continue all 
patients enrolled in Part 1.    
The population for the primary efficacy analysis will contain only patients with penta-
refractory MM enrolled in Part 2. E fficacy results for patients  with quad-refractory MM and 
patients with penta-refractory MM enrolled in Part 1 will be an alyzed separately. Safety 
analyses will be performed on the overall population of patients who received any amount of study treatment, presented overa ll and by [CONTACT_16051], and separ ately for Part 1 penta-
refractory MM patients and quad-refractory MM patients.

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012   
 
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 76 [IP_ADDRESS]. Sub-group Efficacy Analyses 
The subgroup comparisons of interest will be evaluated per the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) (version 1.0). 
13.3. Data Analysis and Presentation 
Summary tabulations will be presented separately for each study  part and by [CONTACT_555279]-refractory 
MM patients and quad-refractory MM patients in Part 1 for dispo sition as noted above, and 
for demographic, baseline, efficacy and safety data as noted in  the following sections. All 
data collected on the eCRF will be provided in by-patient data listings. 
13.3.1. Demographic Characteristics 
Demographic characteristics will be summarized for the mITT, PP , and Safety populations 
and will include gender, race, ethnicity (Hispanic origin), and  age at time of consent. For 
gender, race, and Hispanic origin, t he summary statistics will be the number and percentage 
of patients within each category. The categories for race will be those recorded in the 
database. For age at time of consent, the mean, median, minimum , maximum, and standard 
deviation will be provided for each group and the total sample.  
13.3.2. Baseline Characteristics and Medical History 
Baseline characteristics include: performance status, duration from initial diagnosis, response 
to previous therapy, types of prior therapy, and height/weight. Baseline data will be tabulated 
using summary statistics for the mITT, PP, and Safety populatio ns; no formal hypothesis 
testing will be performed. 
Medical history and physical examination results at baseline wi ll be tabulated for the same 
analysis populations. 
13.3.3. Primary Endpoint 
The primary statistical analysis of efficacy will be performed on ORR (achievement of PR, 
VGPR, CR or sCR) for the mITT population. For the primary analy sis of superiority to the 
minimal threshold ORR, analysis will be performed using a two-s ided 95% confidence 
interval, calculated for the rate of ORR, and statistical signi ficance will be declared if the 
lower bound of this interv al is greater than 10%. 
13.3.4. Secondary Endpoints 
The following secondary efficac y endpoints will be analyzed separately for mITT and PP 
populations.  
x Duration of response (DOR = Dur ation from first observation of at least PR to 
time of disease progression [PD] or death due to disease progression, whichever 
occurs first. DOR will be censored for death due to any causes other than disease 
progression. 
x Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR = sCR + CR + VGPR + PR + minimal response 
[MR]), and duration of clinical benefit (Duration from first observation of at least 
Selinexor (KPT-330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-[ADDRESS_729009]. Duration of clinical benefit will be censored for  death due to any 
causes other than disease progression) 
x Disease Control Rate (DCR = CBR + stable disease [SD; for a min imum of 12 
weeks])  
x Progression Free Survival (PFS =  Duration from start of study treatment to PD or 
death [regardless of cause], whichever comes first)  
x Time to Progression (TTP = Duration from start of study treatme nt to time of 
disease progression) obtained with selinexor plus dexamethasone vs. TTP on most 
recent prior therapy 
x Time to Next Treatment (TTNT = Duration from start of study treatment to start 
of next anti-MM treatment or death due to disease progression, whichever occurs 
first)  
x Overall Survival (OS = Duration fr om start of study treatment t o death)  
x Quality of Life (QoL) using the Functional Assessment of Cancer  Therapy - 
Multiple Myeloma (FACT-MM) 
Time-to-event endpoints (including duration of response, PFS, T TP, and OS) will be 
assessed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods, including an estimate  of the median, as well as 
the 25th and 75th percentiles, along with two-sided 95% CIs. Duration of CBR wil l be 
regarded as descriptive adjuncts to the analyses of response ra tes. Clinical benefit (CBR) and 
disease control (DCR) rates will be statistically evaluated usi ng two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals. 
QoL will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Multiple Myeloma 
(FACT-MM). This instrument combines the General version of the FACT (FACT-G) with a 
MM-specific subscale (14 items). The subscales for the FACT-G a re Physical Well-Being (7 
items), Social/Family Well-Being (7 items), Emotional Well-Bein g (6 items), and Functional 
Well-Being (7 items). The trial outcomes index (TOI; total of 41 items) will be the primary 
measurement of interest, comprised of the Physical and Functional subscales plus the MM-
specific subscale. Each item is rated on a 5- point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) 
to 4 (“Very much”), therefore the TOI has a score ranging from 0 to 120. The QoL 
assessment will be performed at Baseline (prior to first dose of study treatment), Day 1 of each cycle on or after the second, and at the Final visit. The QoL analysis will be based on 
changes in the total TOI score from Baseline using paired T-tes ts. A secondary analysis of 
QoL will be performed in a similar manner using the total of al l subscales. All 5 individual

of study treatment, or any event considered drug-related by [CONTACT_555280]. AEs with partial dates will be assessed using the  available date information to 
determine if treatment-emergent; AEs with completely missing dates will be assumed to be 
treatment-emergent. No formal hypothesis-testing of AE incidenc e rates will be performed. 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_36916] t incidence rates, therefore, i n any tabulation, a patient 
contributes only once to the count  for a given AE (preferred te rm). The number and 
percentage of patients with any treatment-emergent adverse even ts (TEAE) will be 
summarized for each treatment group, classified by [CONTACT_9315]. The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs assessed by [CONTACT_555281]. The number and percentage of patients with any Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_729011] severity 
and/or strongest causal relationship to treatment will be used for purposes of tabulations.  
All reported SAEs will be tabulated. All AEs (treatment-emergent and post-treatment) will be listed in by-patient data listings, 
classified by [CONTACT_3148], patient and day on study. In addition,  separate by-patient listings will 
be provided for the following: deaths; SAEs; and AEs leading to  withdrawal. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Data 
Clinical laboratory values will  be expressed using conventional  units International System of 
Units (SI) units. The actual value and change from baseline (Da y 1, prior to the first 
administration of study drug) to each on-study evaluation will be summarized for each 
clinical laboratory parameter, including hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation and 
urinalysis. In the event of repeat values, the last non-missing  value per study day/time will be 
used. In the event that Day 1 data are unavailable for a given patient/parameter, the 
Screening value will substi tute as the baseline value. 
Severity of select clinical la b measures will be determined usi ng CTCAE v.4.03 criteria (e.g., 
those measures that have a corresponding CTCAE grade classifica tion). Labs with CTCAE 
Grades ≥ [ADDRESS_729012] on-study values relative to CTCAE classification ranges will be produced. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, and ECOG Performance Status  
The actual value and change from baseline (Day 1) to each on-st udy evaluation will be 
summarized for vital signs.  Shift tables that present changes from baseline to worst on-study 
and last on-study ECOG performance status values will be produc ed.  By-patient listings of 
all vital sign measurements and ECOG performance status scores will be presented in data 
listings.

13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 80 Physical examination results at Screening, and physical examina tion results changes during 
the study, will be summarized. All physical examination finding s will be presented in by-
patient data listings. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiogram Results 
Electrocardiogram results will be  summarized descriptively, inc luding heart rate and PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTc intervals (calcu lated by [CONTACT_555282]) intervals. If 
Bazett correction is entered by [CONTACT_779], the Fridericia correc ted QTc interval (QTcF) will be 
derived using the formula: QT/(RR ^[1/3]), where RR = 60/heart r ate. Actual values and 
changes from baseline will be  reported for each study visit. 
Electrocardiogram data for each patient will be provided in a d ata listing. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Ophthalmic Examinations 
Ophthalmic examination findings will be summarized descriptivel y by [CONTACT_765]. All ophthalmic 
examination findings will be presented in the data listings. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Concomitant Medications 
The use of concomitant medications will be included in by-patie nt data listings. 
13.3.8. Procedures for Handling Missing Data 
The procedures for handling missing data will be performed per the SAP (version 1.0). 
13.4. Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analysis 
All deviations from the original statistical analysis plan will  be documented and provided in 
the final clinical study report.

1 All response categories require 2  consecutive assessments made  any time before starting any new therapy; for 
MRD there is no need for [ADDRESS_729018] after each treatment stage is 
recommended (e.g., after induction, high-dose therapy/ASCT, con solidation, maintenance). MRD tests should 
be initiated only at the time of suspected CR. All categories o f response and MRD require no known evidence 
of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were  performed. However, radiographic studies are 
not required to satisfy these res ponse requirements except for the requirement of FDG PET if imaging 
MRD-negative status is reported.

derived from Rajkumar ( Rajkumar 2011 ). When the only method to measure disease is by [CONTACT_555287]: 
CR can be defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in addi tion to the CR criteria listed previously. 
VGPR in such patients requires a ≥  90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved  FLC 
levels. All response categories require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of 
any new therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions or 
extramedullary plasmacytomas if radiographic studies were perfo rmed. Radiographic studies are not required 
to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow assessments  do not need to be confirmed. Each category, 
except for SD, will be considered unconfirmed until the confirm atory test is performed. The date of the initial 
test is considered as the date of  response for evaluation of ti me dependent outcomes such as DOR.

bortezomib, and carfilzomib.”  
To: “Patients must have been previously exposed to lenalidomide, pomalidomide, 
bortezomib, and carfilzomib” and have  “MM double refractory to previous treatment 
with both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_555247]”  
2. Change the study treatment (selinexor plus dexamethasone) dose schedule from 
“twice weekly for three weeks of every four-week cycle” to “twi ce weekly for every 
week of each four-week cycle.”

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP-330-012   
 
13 December 2017, Version 6.0 Confidential Page 107  Adjusted inclusion criteri on #13 (now #12), requiring adequate platelet count of ≥ 
50,000/mm3 (patients in whom ≥ 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plas ma 
cells) at baseline. 
 Added inclusion criteria #13, regarding baseline hemoglobin lev el ≥ 8.5 g/dL.  
 Deleted exclusion criteria #3, MM that does not express either M-protein of FLC is 
no longer excluded.  
 Added exclusion criteria #20 and #21, also to require adequate hematopoietic 
function at baseline. 
 Added exclusion criterion #22, to ens ure that patients can tole rate dexamethasone. 
 Added exclusion criterion #23, a standard item in protocols. 
Documentation Requirements  (also in Section 8.3) 
 A formal statement was added to describe what documentation is needed to establish 
that patients are refractory to prior treatments. 
Study Numbers  (also in Section 13.1.2) 
 Revised estimated enrollment fo r N=122 (for power analysis), and ~130 for 
enrollment. 
Study Duration: 
 Revised enrollment period from 15 months to 24 months.  
Statistical Methods (also in Section 13) 
 Re-stated the statistical assumptions underlying the revised pr imary endpoint. 
Table 1 (Schedule of Assessments)  
 Added FLC on C1D15 and C2D15 
 Added emphasis that MM-specific lab assessments (i.e., SPEP, UP EP, FLC and 
quantitative Ig) must be performed at the time of PD to evaluat e response. This is an 
essential requirement of the IMW G and was included in previous versions of this 
protocol, but its visibility is being increased in this version  to support investigatory 
site staff. 
 Reduced size of footnotes and added cross-referencing to protocol sections 
List of Abbreviations :  
 Deleted abbreviations that were not in use and added several ne w abbreviations 
Protocol, Main Body  
Sections 7.2, 7.3 and 9.9.1 
 Establish an IRC to perform the central read of response data (for the efficacy analysis) that had been previously included under the Data Safe ty Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) in previous versions of this protocol. The DSMC, now referred to as Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will retain its role of reviewing all study

Protocol Approval Signature [CONTACT_3490] 
 Replaced Michael Kauffman, MD, PhD, Acting Chief Medical Office r, with 
Humphrey Gardner, M.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Develop ment, as a 
signatory. 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (also in Sections 8.4 and 8.5)  
 Modified inclusion criteria #3d to remove turbidometry as an ac ceptable method to 
measure quantitative Ig levels. 
 Modified inclusion criteria  #4 and #[ADDRESS_729028] 
 Corrected inclusion criteria #7 t o refer to exclusion criteria #17 
 Corrected inclusion criteria #12 t o refer to exclusion criteria  #20 
 Changed inclusion criteria #12a to total WBC count > 1,000/mm3 to update criteria 
for this patient population. 
 Corrected exclusion criteria  #17 to add ≥ before Grade 2 painful neuropathy  
 Modified exclusion criteria  #22 to add or contraindication for before glucocorticoids 
to further clarify the medical intent of the original language.  
 Added a new exclusion criterion immediately after exclusion cri teria #22 and moved 
the previous #23 to #24. The addition of exclusion criteria #23 , prior exposure to a 
SINE compound, including selinexor, provides consistency across  Karyopharm 
protocols. 
IMWG Response Criteria (also in Sections 6.1, 9.3, and Appendix  3) 
 Updated the IMWG response criteria for myeloma to align with th e most recent 
IMWG criteria (Kumar, Lancet. 2016;17:328-346). The definition for MR was 
changed from “minor” to “minimal” response to align with the IMWG Consensus 
Criteria. 
Documentation Requirements (also in Section 8.3) 
 Removed the requirement to show a patient was refractory to isa tuximab to align with 
feedback on isatuximab from FDA.

Background
xMutations in GATA2 lead to an immunodefi ciency disease that transforms into 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute  myelogenous leukemia (AML).  This 
syndrome, previously known as MonoMAC, has 4 clinical features: 1) infections with 
Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) and othe r opportunistic infections as a teenager 
or young adult, 2) a peripheral blood leukocyte flow cytometry profile with T-lymphocytes, but a severe deficiency of monocytes, B-lymphocytes, and Natural Killer (NK) cells, 3) the propensity to progress to MDS/AML, and 4) mutations in the gene GATA2.  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_510133] a reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoi etic stem cell transplantatio n (HSCT) regimen for patients 
with mutations in GATA2.  We are particularly interested in determining whether allogeneic HSCT using this regimen reconstitutes normal hematopoiesis in patients with mutations in GATA2. 
Objectives
xPrimary Objective:
1) To determine efficacy, namely whether reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT results in 
engraftment and restores normal hematopoiesis by [CONTACT_395789] y +100 in patients with 
mutations in GATA2. 
2) To determine the safety of this HSCT regimen in patients with mutations in GATA2, 
including transplant related toxicity, the in cidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-
host disease, immune reconstitution, overall survival, and dis ease-free survival

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 P RIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES
1) In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510136], to determine efficacy, namely whether reduced-intensity allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) results in engr aftment and restores normal 
hematopoiesis by [CONTACT_4475] +100 in pa tients with mutations in GATA2.
2) To determine the safety of reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT regimen in patients with 
mutations in GATA2 including transplant relate d toxicity, the incidence of acute and chronic 
graft-versus-host disease, immune reconstituti on, overall survival, and disease-free survival.
1.[ADDRESS_659472] description 50 years ago, the nu mber of hematopoietic stem cell transplants 
(HSCT) has increased steadily; 50,[ADDRESS_659473] in 2006 (Thomas et 
al. 1957; Appelbaum 2007).  Although allogeneic HSCT can cure hematological malignancies, 
bone marrow failure syndromes, and genetic hematolo gical and immunodeficiency diseases, the 
success of therapy depends upon the prompt identi fication of a suitable donor.  Because matched 
related donors were required in  the initial HSCT, this limited the number of HSCT performed; 
only [ADDRESS_659474] ing myeloablative versus reduced-intensity 
conditioning regimens is descri bed in the ensuing paragraphs.
The use of conditioning regimens containing high doses of alkylating agents, often in 
combination with total body irradiation, are cons idered “myeloablative;” these regimens were 
perceived to be essential both for eradication of  malignant disease and for suppression of the 
host-versus-graft response to the donor stem cells  (i.e. rejection) (Cope lan 2006). Myeloablative 
conditioning regimens caused severe damage to  normal organs within the body resulting in a 
high incidence of morbidity and mortality (Bear man et al. 1988). This limited the application of 
allogeneic HSCT to younger patients (< 60 years of age) who could tolerate these toxicities.  Subsequent studies and observations challenged the assumption th at myeloablative conditioning 
was necessary to eliminate malignancy and per mit the engraftment of the donor hematopoietic 
and immune systems. 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659475] resulted from 
a T-cell-mediated graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect  (Champlin 1990).  It was also recognized that 
conventional myeloablative regimens do not completely eliminate the host response to the allograft, even in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570]-matched allografts.  For example, one study indicated that 30 to 40% of patients will reject a T-cell-depleted, HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell graft after myeloablative conditioning (Martin et al. 1988).  In addition, there are certain clinical situations where the malignancy is very susceptible to the allogeneic GVT effect (e.g. AML in complete remission, chronic leukemia or low-grade lymphoma.  In these clinical situations, the use of a 
myeloablative-conditioning regime n may be adding toxicity without eradicating the tumor. 
These limitations of myeloablative conditioning re gimens, combined with the high levels of 
morbidity and mortality associated with myel oablation, result in a compromised therapeutic 
index for this form of allogeneic HSCT.  Redu cing treatment-related toxicity would improve the 
therapeutic index of allogeneic HSCT, permitting the broader application and potential benefit of 
this treatment to more patients.  This principle led to the development of less intensive 
“nonmyeloablative” and “reduced-intensity” cond itioning regimens for allogeneic HSCT, which 
were designed with the purpose of allowing en graftment of donor cells to exploit the potential 
allogeneic GVT effect (Giralt et al. 1997; Slav in et al. 1998; Childs et al. 1999; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]. 
2000; Khouri et al. 2001).
The early reports of studies employing nonmye loablative and reduced-intensity conditioning 
regimens prior to allogeneic HSCT demonstrated that early engraftment occurred in the majority 
of patients, and early transpla nt-related toxicities (first 100 days  after transplantation) were 
reduced.  This indicated that reduced-intensity regimens could be used for older patients and 
patients with co-morbidities.  However, it was also observed that both nonmyeloablative and 
reduced-intensity conditioning we re associated with high incidences of incomplete donor 
chimerism, higher incidences of graft rejection/failure, and increased relapse rates, as compared to results with myeloablative conditioning regimens (Khouri et al. 1998; Aoudjhane et al. 2005).Mixed chimerism and graft rejection were also associated with HLA-disparity and the use of unrelated donors, and correlated inversely with the amount of therapy prior to transplant 
(McSweeney et al. 2001; Maris et  al. 2003; Carvallo et al. 2004).  It was also observed that a 
GVT effect was not observed until full donor ch imerism was achieved (Truitt and Atasoylu 
1991; Mackinnon et al. 1994; Childs et al. 2000;  Orsini et al. 2000; Petrus et al. 2000).
To decrease toxicity, and to develop immunosuppre ssive as opposed to myeloablative regimens, 
many centers explored combinations of regimens including the use of low dose radiation.  Low dose radiation alone has been shown to have an ti-leukemia properties.  A dose of 200 cGy total 
body irradiation (TBI) was adequate for inducin g remission, albeit short lived, in refractory 
patients ineligible for other st andard treatments (Shulman et al . 1998).  Doses of [ADDRESS_659476] very little toxicity in both murine and rhesus transplant models (Huhn et al. 1999; Kang et al. 2001).  Even patients wi th Fanconi anemia, who would be considered 
high risk for radiation induced toxicity, tole rate moderate dose (500 cGy) radiation based 
regimens (Dufour et al. 2001).  While regarded as a method designed for the creation of “space” 
within the marrow in bone marrow transplanta tion (BMT) regimens, radiation has long been the 
basis of the establishment of immunosuppressive protocols for both BMT and solid organ transplantation in animal models (Myburgh et al. 1980; Myburgh et al. 1984).  There is extensive 
clinical experience demonstrating stable mixed  chimerism with the use of 200 cGy total body

irradiation and fludarabine, followed by [CONTACT_510234] D prophylaxis with Cyclosporine (CSP) and 
mycophenolic acid (MMF) (Hegenbart et al. 2006).
This protocol aims to ta ke advantage of the immunodeficiency st ate in patients with mutations in 
GATA2 to achieve a high level of donor chimerism following HSCT using a reduced intensity 
conditioning regimen with low-dose TBI and fludar abine.  Because opportunistic infections are 
present in many of these patients, along with  MDS, both high levels of chimerism and low 
regimen related toxicity are important considerations in designing a transplant regimen for this cohort.
1.2.[ADDRESS_659477] is potentially curative for many hematological malignancies, however, as 
previously noted, stem cell donor availability limits the broader a pplication of this treatment.  
Only 25% to 30% of patients have a sibling donor who is fully matched at the class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci that encode for the human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1, and DQB1) (Appel baum 2007).  This limitation prompted the 
exploration of alternative stem cell sources for allogeneic HSCT including the use HLA-matched unrelated donors (Kernan et al. 1993).  Enro llment of volunteer donors in national and 
international registries, such as National Marro w Donor Program (NMDP) in the [LOCATION_002], 
has facilitated the identification of unrelated stem cell donors for patient s without HLA-matched 
sibling donors.  However, transplants from unrelat ed donors are complicated by [CONTACT_510235], acute and chronic GVHD, and treatm ent-related mortality.  These complications 
are partially balanced by [CONTACT_510236].  These complications have limited ma tched unrelated donor myeloablative HSCT to 
patients less than [ADDRESS_659478] utilizing unre lated donors (Tables 1A a nd 1B) (Giralt et al. 
2001; Chakraverty et al. 2002; Kroger et al. 2002;  Maris et al. 2003; Nied erwieser et al. 2003; 
Wong et al. 2003).  Of note, the median ages of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510137] [ADDRESS_659479]  ranged from 0 to 21%.  The primary adverse 
factors related to graft rejec tion were: use of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, HLA-
mismatching, transplant with  bone marrow rather than mobilized peripheral blood, and a 
minimal amount of prior therapy prior to transp lant.  Using a variety of GVHD prophylaxis 
regimens, the reported incidences of Grade II-IV and Grade III-IV acute GVHD have been 21-
63% and 6-39%, respectively.  Early (< [ADDRESS_659480]-transplant) treat ment-related mortality 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659481] varied from 10 to 48%; one-year treatment-related mortality rates have varied from 17 
to 55%.  One-year overall survival rates have b een reported to be 32 to 75% (Tables 1A and 1B).
The majority of the reduced-intensity reg imens are based on chemotherapy, however a 
considerable experience, primarily from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, has accumulated using 200 cGy low-dose TBI in the conditioning regimen along with fludarabine (Maris et al. 2003; Nieder wieser et al. 2003).  This work was first described in the 1990’s in the 
canine model and demonstrated that [ADDRESS_659482]-transplant immunosuppression with Cyclosporine (CSP) a nd Mycophenolate (MMF) resulted in stable 
engraftment of dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-mat ched littermate recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (Storb et al. 1999).
When these results were translated to humans it was shown that the addition of fludarabine 
significantly increased the rate of engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem  cells (Mielcarek et 
al. 2007).  Using this regimen the Seattle grou p recently reported comparable engraftment 
between matched unrelated an d matched related recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].
This protocol uses a reduced-int ensity regimen to treat patients with mutations in GATA2 who 
have a 10/10 matched related donor, a 10/10 ma tched unrelated donor, or a 9/[ADDRESS_659483] incidences of transplant related 
mortalities (Maris et al. 2003).  This factor is important since patients with mutations in GATA2 are frequently debilitated from infections with opportunistic organisms such as mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).

1.2.[ADDRESS_659485] of HLA on Transplant Outcomes :
Since its inception, the NMDP has required ev aluation of donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510138] (HLA-A, -B, and -DR) prior to unrelated donor HSCT (Bray et al. 2008). The 
minimum acceptable match was originally defined by [CONTACT_510237] 3 loci (6 possible 
antigens) and required at least 5 matches, that is, a “5 of 6 match”. This requirement has changed little over the years. Currently, to request a donor for transplantati on, the minimal acceptable 
level of matching remains a 5 of  6 match for HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1. Although only evaluated 
at antigen level of resolution (“low resolution”) fo r donor release, each of these [ADDRESS_659486] now 
be typed at high-resolution by [CONTACT_100660]-based met hods. High-resolution typi[INVESTIGATOR_510139] (ARS) domains (Exons 2 and 3 of Class I and exon 2 of Cla ss II genes). In 2005, a requirement for HLA-C
typi[INVESTIGATOR_510140]. The most recent studies have clearly shown that transplant outcomes can be improved by [CONTACT_510238]-C, -DP, -DQ, and haplotypes (Petersdorf 2006).As data on high resolution typi[INVESTIGATOR_510141], the NMDP performed an analysis on the effects 
of HLA matching (low or high resolution or both) on engraftment, graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD), and mortality in 1874 donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510142]-A, -B, -C, -DRB 1, -DQ, and -DP (Flomenberg et al. 2004).
There was no effect of any mismatch on engraftment, and only a mismatch at HLA-A affected whether the patients experienced Grade II-IV acute GVHD or chronic GVHD. Single 
mismatches at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 each had similar adverse effects on mortality (relative risk 1.23 - 1.33), as compared to individuals matched at all four loci.  The 5-year overall survival 
rates for a match at all four loci (“8 of 8” as compared to a single mismatch (“7 of 8”) was 39% 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
and 31%, respectively.  In this analysis, mismatc hes at HLA-DQ or -DP did not appear to exert 
any significant effect on survival (5-year overall survival = 39%) or any other outcome.  The 
observed adverse effects on outcome were more evid ent in transplants with low-resolution versus 
only high-resolution mismatches.  When high-re solution mismatches at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -
DRB1 were considered together, adverse ef fects on survival and GVHD were observed.  The 
authors concluded that ma tching for HLA-C should be incorporat ed into algorithms for unrelated 
donor selection, along with HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 (i.e. “8 of 8”).
In a subsequent analysis, the NMDP looked at  data from 3857 transplant ations.  Patient-donor 
pairs were fully typed for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, -DQA1, -DPB1, and -DPA1 alleles 
(Lee et al. 2007).  High-resoluti on DNA matching for HLA-A, -B, -C , and -DRB1 (8 of 8 match) 
was the minimum level of matching associated with the highest survival.  A single mismatch 
detected by [CONTACT_6398]- or high-resolution DNA testing at  HLA-A, -B, -C or -DRB1 (7/8 match) was 
associated with higher mortality (relative ri sk = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.38; P < 0.001) and 1-year 
survival of 43% compared with 52% for 8 of 8 matched pairs.  Single mismatches at HLA-B or 
HLA-C appeared to be better tolerated than mism atches at HLA-A or HLA-DRB1.  Mismatching 
at 2 or more loci compounded the risk.  Mismat ching at HLA-DP or -DQ loci and donor factors 
other than HLA type were not associated with survival.  In multivariate modeling, patient age, race, disease stage, and cytomegalovirus status were as pred ictive of survival as donor HLA 
matching. The authors concluded that high-res olution DNA matching for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -
DRB1 alleles is associated with higher rates of survival.
Based on these results, the NMDP has established guidelines relative to donor selection based on 
HLA-typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Bray et al. 2008).  The optimal donor  should be matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -
DRB1 by [CONTACT_5019]-resolution typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  When there are multiple donors with this degree of matching, further matching at HLA-DQ may be utilized; however, the clinical utility does not reach 
statistical significance.  If a mismatch is unavoidable, a single mismatch at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 should be sought.  In the NMDP data , mismatches at HLA-B and -C may be less 
detrimental than those at HLA-A and -DRB1.
1.2.[ADDRESS_659487] blood (UCB) represents an altern ative to bone marrow as a source of HSC for 
transplantation in individuals who lack an HLA- matched donor, and has been used as a source of 
donor hematopoietic stem  cells HSC to treat a variety of malignant and non-malignant 
hematological disorders (Kurtzberg et al. 1996; Wagner et al. 2002).  The advantages of UCB 
include the ease of procurement, lack of donor attrition, absence of maternal risk, reduced risk of 
GVHD, and less stringent criteria for HLA matchi ng (Wagner and Kurtzberg 1997).  The major 
limitations in UCB are the relatively decreased cell dose leading to delayed engraftment, extended post-transplant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, a nd an increased incidence of 
infection and bleeding.  The developments since the first HSCT using UCB in [ADDRESS_659488] in Pediatrics 
The initial descriptions of signif icant cohorts of patients treated  using UCB transplant involved 
the use of single UCB units in children and myeloablative conditioning regimens (Kurtzberg et 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
al. 1996; Gluckman et al. 1997).  Both studies confirmed the potential of  UCB transplant to 
induce remission in patients with refractory hematological malignancies.  The two studies also 
reported a lower than predicted frequency of GVHD. 
These early studies with UCB HSCT from sibling donors led to the banking of unrelated donor 
UCB.  Using banked UCB (from the [LOCATION_001] Blood Center) in 167 children with hematological malignancies, congenital / acquire d bone marrow failure syndromes, and genetic 
diseases, 93% of the patients engrafted.  Engraf tment was subsequently found to correlate with 
the number of CD34+ cells transpla nted, rather than the degree of  HLA matching.  Retrospective 
analysis indicated that a dose of CD34+ cells <2-3 x 10
5CD34+ cells/kg resulted in diminished 
and delayed engraftment of platelets and neutrophils.  Multivariate analysis revealed that any dose >3 x 10
5CD34+ cells/kg results in fairly consistent engraftment. 
Unrelated Donor UCB HSCT in AdultsThree studies specifically addressed the use of UCB grafts in adults (Gluckman 2000; Laughlin et al. 2001; Sanz et al. 2001).  These studies consisted of adult patients with hematological 
diseases who underwent myeloablative conditioni ng followed by [CONTACT_44688]-ma tched or mismatched 
UCB infusion.  The probability of myeloid engraf tment and the probability of developi[INVESTIGATOR_510143]-IV ranged from 81% to 100% and 38% to 60%, respectively.  The event free 
survival (EFS) (with at least 1 year of follow up)  ranged from 21% to 53%.  These data indicated 
that UCB SCT led to lower than expected rates of acute GVHD, especially in the setting of mismatched HLA grafts, and encouraged further study using UCB.   
Two recent reports specifically compared the outcomes of adult patients with acute leukemia or 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) transplanted with either HLA-mismatched UCB or HLA-matched and mismatc hed BM grafts (Laughlin et al. 2004; Rocha et al. 2004).  Time to 
neutrophil and platelet engraftment and recovery were significantly longer after UCB SCT than BMT.  Acute GVHD was more likely after mismatched marrow transplant, however chronic GVHD was more likely after UCB transplant.  Tr eatment-related mortality (TRM), treatment 
failure (i.e. relapse or death), and overall mortality were lowest in patients receiving HLA-matched BM grafts.  There was no difference in the rate of recurrence of leukemia among the 
groups.  The adjusted probability of three-year survival was 26% for patients receiving UCB grafts; this was similar to patients receiving HLA-mismatched BM. 
The conclusion from these studies was that UCB represented a curative alternative donor source 
for patients with hematological malignancies who lacked a bone marrow donor.  When compared 
with URD BMT, there is a delay in neutrophil and platelet engraftment, a higher risk of graft 
failure, and an increase in TRM during the first [ADDRESS_659489] in the adult population has b een tempered by [CONTACT_510239].  Investigators at Case Western Reserve University found that a higher nucleated cell dose and higher CD34+ cell dose correlated with more ra pid neutrophil recovery and improved survival, 
respectively in adult patients undergoing UCB HS CT (Laughlin et al. 2001).  The importance of 
cell dose was further supported by [CONTACT_510240][INVESTIGATOR_510144] < 1.8 x

Version Date: 05/18/2016
107NC/kg or < 1.7 x 105CD34+ cells/kg body weight had sign ificantly decreased engraftment 
and survival (Wagner et al. 2002).
Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used as part of the preparative regimen prior to the 
infusion of donor cells to decrease the incidence of  graft rejection and to decrease the incidence
of GVHD by [CONTACT_510241] T-cells in the graft.  Animal expe riments originally 
demonstrated the synergistic immunosuppressive effects between ATG and alkylating agents. 
The combination of ATG and cyclophosphamide was subsequently used widely in HSCT.
In a non-malignant disease setting, substitution of cyclophosphamide by [CONTACT_510242] a busulfan based regimen of matched related donor  transplant in 5 children and adults 
with beta-thalasse mia, all patients engrafted with 2 of the 5 maintaining 100% donor chimerism 
(Sauer et al. 2005).Additional support for the use of ATG in UCB appeared in late 2007 with the description of 110 
adult patients who received UCB following a non myeloablative-conditioning  regimen (Brunstein 
et al. 2007).  This large study of 110 patient s utilized a conditioning regimen consisting of 
Fludarabine 200 mg/m2, Cytoxan 50 mg/kg, and 200 cGy TBI, and Equine ATG (ATGAM) 15 
mg/kg IV every [ADDRESS_659490] 3 x 
10
7total nucleated cells (TNC)/kg in each patient, a nd if the cord blood unit contained less than 
that amount, two UCB units were infused.  This resulted in 85% of patients receiving two UCB 
units.  With the double UCB units neutrophils recovered to 500/ μl at a median of 12 days and 
platelets required a mean of 49 days to achieve a level of 20,000/ μl.  Grade 3 and 4 GVHD 
occurred in 22% and 23% of patients, respectively.   Interestingly, by [ADDRESS_659491]-transplant one 
of the units prevailed in over 80% of the patients. Survival was 45% at 3 years with an event free 
survival of 38%. 
Advantages of UCB
The reasons for the expanded use of UCB as a donor  source are many.  The first advantage lies 
in the immediate availability of cells.  The median time from request to acquisition of the UCB is 13.5 days (Barker et al. 2002).  Since there is no risk to the donor, there is no donor unavailability, such as that which occurs with  unrelated donors in which an estimated 25 percent 
of donors who are identified are subsequently unable to donate HSC (Wagner et al. 2002).
Second, acceptable cord-blood units can be identified for most patients because less stringent HLA-compatibility with the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510145] (Rocha et al. 2000).  Third, the incidence and 
severity of GVHD are not excessive with UCB, even with cord-blood units mismatched for more 
than one HLA antigen (Brunstein et al. 2007).   Moreover, the graft-versus-leukemia effects are 
maintained with UCB grafts (Laughlin et al. 2004).
UCB banks have been developed worldwide and standardized banking procedures have been 
implemented (Rubinstein et al. 1998).  The low rate of viral infection at birth and the collection 
of cord blood from ethnic groups not well repr esented in bone marrow donor registries are 
additional advantages of UCB.  There are an estimated 170,[ADDRESS_659492] blood registries 
in 21 countries (Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide Homepage  ( www.bmdw.org ).
The main obstacle for use of cord blood transplant  in adults has been the low number of stem 
cells in cord blood units leading to delayed en graftment and graft failu re.  The number of HSC 
in a unit of cord blood is approximately one tenth the number of HSC in a marrow harvest 
(Laughlin et al. 2001).  The low number of HSC in UCB results in more  gradual reconstitution 
of hematopoiesis following UCB grafts compar ed to bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659493]-transplant in fection and early death 
(Rocha et al. 2000).  This limitation in UCB SCT ha s been decreasing with the increasing use of 
double cord units. 
We propose to consider the use UCB as the sour ce of donor HSC for patients with mutations in 
GATA2 who lack a 10/[ADDRESS_659494] cyclophosphamide targets prolif erating, alloreactive T-cells and prevents 
GVHD (Luznik et al. 2002).
In 2002 O'Donnell and colleagues at Johns Hopkins described results using a nonmyeloablative 
bone marrow transplant from par tially HLA-mismatched relate d donors using post-transplant 
cyclophosphamide (O'Donnell et al. 2002).  Donors were partially HLA-ma tched (up to 3 HLA 
antigens) from first-degree relatives.  They demonstrated comparable levels of engraftment and GVHD to that seen with matched unrelated donor tr ansplants.  The regimen is shown (Figure 1).

Non-malignant diseases were also amenable to the nonmyeloablative regimen described.  In

Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659496] was reported from Johns 
Hopkins and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer resear ch Center by [CONTACT_510243] 2008 (Luznik et al. 
2008).  A total of [ADDRESS_659497]-transpla nt on day +3 or two days of cyclophosphamide 
on days + 3 and +4.  There were 9 graft failures (13%).  There was no difference in GVHD with one or two days of cyclophosphamide post-transpla nt.  The overall survival at one year was 46% 
with an event-free survival of 34% in a hi gh risk population of patients with  leukemia. 
When this data was summarized recently, ther e was a total of [ADDRESS_659498] at Johns Hopkins with 87% sustained dono r engraftment(Munchel et al.).  The cumulative 
incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were 27% and 13%, respectively.  The 5-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 18%; relapse was 55%, actuarial 
overall survival 35%, event-free survival 27%.  Thus, mini-Haplo HSCT with post-transplant 
cyclophosphamide was associated with favorable toxicity and overall survival for patients 
without matched relate d or unrelated donors. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_659499] primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) consist of intrinsic genetic defects of 
hematopoietic lineage-deri ved cells.  Therefore, replacement of genetically impaired cells by 
[CONTACT_510244] a logical therapeutic appro ach. It has now been demonstrated that HSCT 
can reverse the phenotype in a variety of PID.  The initial reports of successful HSCT in PID 
included severe combined immunodeficiency di sease (SCID) and Wiskott-Alrich Syndrome 
(WASP) (Bach et al. 1968; Gatti et al. 1968).  By 2003, over [ADDRESS_659500] (Buckl ey 2003).  In all, [ADDRESS_659501], including a nu mber of SCID variants, WASP, and various 
phagocytic disorders such as chronic granul omatous disease (CGD), and leukocyte adhesion 
deficiency (LAD) (Le Deist et al. 1989; Buckley 2003).
In the largest cohort of patie nts with SCID receiving HSCT, Buckley reported on 89 infants 
transplanted at Duke between 1992 and 1998 (Buckl ey et al. 1999).  The majority of patients 
with SCID were boys with X- OLQNHGFRPPRQ -chain SCID.  However, six had Janus kinase 3 
(Jak3) mutations, 13 had adenosine deaminase de ficiency (ADA)-SCID, three had IL-7R alpha-
chain defects, and [ADDRESS_659502] cases the GVHD was mild and did not require 
treatment. 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659503] 
has been successfully employed in a number of pa tients with PID (Ash et al. 1990; Filipovich et 
al. 1992; Kernan et al. 1993).  Kernan reported a [ADDRESS_659504] to treat PID (Kernan et al. 1993).
In primary immune deficiency diseases (PID) donor engraftment may be achieved following 
allogeneic HSCT with no or reduced-intensity conditioning due to the inability of the host 
immune system to mediate graft rejection (Buckley et al. 1999; Rao et al. 2005).  Thus, PID constitutes an experiment of nature in which a nonmyeloablative-conditioning regimen may result in sufficient levels of donor engraftment to  mediate a graft-versus-leukemia effect without 
the toxicity of a myeloablative-conditioning regimen. Reduced in tensity conditioning regimens 
are particularly well suited for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in pa tients with non-malignant 
stem cell disorders where tumor kill is not requi red and co-morbid conditions are frequent.  Also, 
since a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen allo ws autologous recovery if the graft should 
fail, a second transplant remains a possibility. 
The optimal nonmyeloablative-conditioning regimen for HSCT in PID has yet to be defined.  
However, a number of non-malignant diseases ha ve been successfully treated using reduced-
intensity conditioning regimens in stem cell transplantation, often leading to a state of mixed 
chimerism.  Immunodeficiency dise ases treated with non-myeloabl ative transplantation include 
hyper-IgM syndrome (Kato et al. 1999), adenosin e deaminase deficiency  (Honig et al. 2007),
chronic granulomatous disease (H orwitz et al. 2001), Wiskott-Al drich syndrome (Kapoor et al. 
1981; Longhurst et al. 2002), and leukocyte adhesion deficiency–I (LAD-I) (Engel et al. 2006).
In a study of 14 patients with PID receiving e ither no conditioning or conditioning with 200 cGy 
TBI +/- fludarbine prior to matc hed related or unrelated donor HSCT, event-free survival was 62 
per cent (Burroughs et al. 2007).  This was a heterogeneous group with six patients receiving 
matched related donor HSCT, and [ADDRESS_659505], Veys and colleagues demonstrated a 94 percent survival in 33 patients treated with 
a reduced-intensity regimen consisting of Melphalan 140 mg/m
2, fludarabine 150 mg/m2, and 
alemtuzumab (Campath 1H 1 mg/kg) (Veys et al . 2005).  All HSCT were T-cell replete.  They 
observed rapid engraftment in [ADDRESS_659506]-transplant only 55 percent of the patients 
had 100 percent donor chimerism.  Possibly as a result of the low level of complete donor chimerism, only 9 percent of the patients in the RIC group had acute GVHD more than grade II.  There was also a very high rate of viral reactivation associated with the use of Campath.
The lower regimen-related toxicity with  low-dose TBI plus fludarabine 30 mg/m
2/day for [ADDRESS_659507] co-morbidities 
related to their underlying immunodeficiency.  The use of Campath, although an effective immunoablative agent, poses an unacceptable risk in patients who are already at high risk for opportunistic infections.

Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659508] a severe deficiency of monocytes (Mono) in the peripheral blood, and the propensity to develop Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) infections (Vinh et al. 2010).  These patients have now been shown  to harbor mutations in GATA2 (Hsu et al.).
The important differences between  patients with mutations in GAT A2 and previously described 
primary immunodeficiency diseases are that patient s with mutations in GATA2 have: 1) onset of 
disease beyond infancy, frequently in late adolescence or early adulthood, 2) a clinical history of life-threatening opportunistic inf ections, primarily MAC, 3) a peripheral blood leukocyte subset 
profile with the presence of T-lymphocytes, but a severe deficiency of B-lymphocytes, NK cells, 
and monocytes, 4) a genetic component suggestive of a dominant pattern of  inheritance, and 5) 
frequent progression to MDS.  Th is contrasts with the vast majority of genetic PID which 
manifest in infancy, rarely have both dissemin ated MAC and disseminated fungal infections, 
lack T-lymphocytes, and do not progress to MDS/AML.  
Previously described PID are characterized by [CONTACT_510245] T-lymphocyte compartment.  The first 
category, recognized over 50 years ago, consists of T-, B+, and Natural Killer (NK)- (severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID).  The largest group of these patients is X-SCID due to mutations in the common gamma chain of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21.  Autosomal recessive forms of T-,B+, NK- S CID are due to mutations in the Jak3 kinase.  
The second group of PID consists of T-, B-, NK+ SCID.  These patients have defects in the variable, diversity, joining (VDJ) recombination machinery.  Examples of this form of PID include Rag (Recombination activating gene) defe cts, Omenn syndrome, and Artemis deficiency. 
Both these forms of PID manifest at birth with severe infections; these infections commonly lead to death by 6 months of age. 
Patients with mutations in GATA2 present in their late teens or early twenties, and ultimately 
succumb to either disseminated infection or MDS/ AML over 2-[ADDRESS_659509] has been used successfully to treat both 
genetic immunodeficiency diseases and MDS/AML, the two characteristics of the patients with

Thus, patients with mutations in GATA2 succumb to either from opportunistic infection or bone

or MDS/AML.  The biological question for pati ents with mutations in GATA2 is whether the 
individual leukocyte compartments that are lost in  this syndrome (B-lymphocytes, NK cells, and 
monocytes) will be constituted with HSCT. , 
Both autosomal dominant and sporadic cases of GATA2 mutation occurs in this syndrome.  To 
date, we have identified [ADDRESS_659514] mutations in GATA2 affecting 20 patients and relatives with 
this syndrome, including recurrent missense mu tations affecting the zinc finger-2 domain 
(R398W and T354M) (Hsu et al.).  Four discrete insertion/deletion mutations leading to frame shifts and premature termination implicate haploinsufficiency as a possible mechanism of action.  
These mutations were identified in several families, indicating germ line transmission in those kindred's.  Thus, GATA2 joins RUNX1 and CEBPA not only as familial leukemia genes, but also 
as a cause of a complex congenital immunodeficien cy that evolves over decades and combines 
predisposition to infection and myeloid malignancy.

MDS are a heterogeneous group of clonal hema topoietic disorders characterized by [CONTACT_510246] (cyt openias) and most commonly a hypercellular, dysplastic-
appearing bone marrow (Nimer 2008).  The incidence of MDS increases with increasing age; the 
median age at diagnosis is in the seventh d ecade (Greenberg et al. 1997).  Survival after 
diagnosis varies from a few months to several years.  MDS were originally called pre-leukemia, but the term MDS replaced pre-leukemia in the 
1970’s due to the clinical observation that that many individuals with MDS succumbed to the 
effects of the cytopenias without transforming to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Nimer

are grouped into one of four prognostic categories: low-risk, intermediate 1 risk, intermediate 2 risk, and high risk.
In MDS cytogenetic risk groups defined by [CONTACT_510247]: good -normal isol ated –Y, del (5q), and 
deletion 20q; poor- complex >3  abnormalities, and/or any chromosome 7 anomalies; 
intermediate- all other abnormalities (Greenberg et al. 1997). In terms of frequency, deletions of 
all or part of chromosome [ADDRESS_659517] common cyto genetic abnormality in 
MDS, next to deletions of 5q.  In a recent co mprehensive analysis correlating the cytogenetics 
with the clinical outcome in MDS, monosomy 7 as an isolated abnormality led to a median 
survival of 14 months (Haase et al. 2007).
Monosomy 7 is a characteristic cytogenetic a bnormality in acquired aplastic anemia and 
congenital neutropenia (Maciejewski et al. 200 2).  Cells lacking chromosome 7 frequently 
express a short isoform of the G-CSF receptor, and this short isoform preferentially signals 
proliferation over differentiation leading to clona l expansion in the setting of neutropenia or 
cytokine administration (Maciejewski et al. 2002).
Good prognostic factors for HSCT include: age, lo w IPSS score, short duration of disease (< 3-6
months), blast percentage < 5%, and complete  remission before transplant.  The long-term 
disease-free survival with HSCT for MDS from e ither a matched related or unrelated donor in 
patients less than 50 years old ranges from 36% for matched related donor s to 25% for matched 
unrelated donors (de Witte et al. 2001).In patients with mutations in GATA2 allogeneic HSCT represents a potential curative therapy 
for MDS.  Of particular relevance to patients with mutations in GATA2with progression to MDS, many centers are now using a reduced-intensity approach because of age and frequent co-morbidities in patients with MD S.  In a Spanish study 20 MDS patients received conditioning 
with busulfan 10 mg/kg and fludarabine 150 mg/m
2and peripheral blood stem cells from HLM-
matched related donors (Mar tino et al. 2002).  The transplant related mortality at one year was 
5%.
In one of the largest studies using reduced-intensity conditioning followed by [CONTACT_510248] 148 patients with MDS a nd MPS, patients received a cond itioning regimen consisting of 
low-dose TBI (200 cGy) alone or with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_659518]-grafting 
immunosuppression with CSP and MMF  (Laport et al. 2008).  Approximately one-half of the 
patients received matched related donor HSCT, and the other half received matched unrelated 
donor HSCT.  The three-year relapse-free survival and overall survival were 27% for all patients.  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510148]-relapse mortality, and 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659519] would include 
medications that are well tolerated with minimal side effects/toxicities, prevent GVHD, and enable engraftment without an excess rate of disease relapse.  Commonly used drugs for the prevention of GVHD after HSCT include: cycl osporine (CSP), methotrexate (MTX), and 
corticosteroids. For patients undergoing transplantation w ith either HLA matched or 
mismatched unrelated donors who are receiving reg imens of the above medi cations the incidence 
of acute GVHD has been reported being 40-70% (B eatty et al. 1985; Anase tti et al. 1990; Hansen 
et al. 1998).  In addition to incompletely su ppressing GVHD, these medications are also 
associated with a wide variety of undesirable side effects.  Due to these problems, there is a continued interest in the development of more efficacious regimens.
In recent studies the immunosuppressive agent si rolimus (Rapamycin) has been shown to prevent 
GVHD (Antin et al. 2003).  Sirolimus inhibits T-cell and dendritic cell function through 
inhibition of mTOR, which in contrast to the mRNA inhibition associated with calcineurin 
blockade, operates via a post-tran scriptional mechanism to redu ce cell signaling and modulates 
protein translation and phosphorylation (Hackstein  et al. 2003).  It appears that sirolimus 
prevents the translation of mRNAs encoding cell cycle regulators and inhibits the ability of lymphocytes to proliferate in response to IL2 (Chakraverty et al. 2002).  Sirolimus also has 
profound effects on dendritic cell func tion and survival, and this may contribute to prevention of 
GVHD (Chakraverty et al. 2002). Initial results indicate that sirolimus may be an effective agent for prevention of graft rejection and GVHD when  used in conjunction with a second agent. 
Recently, sirolimus has been used as a thir d agent for GVHD prophylaxis after genetically 
disparate transplantation (Antin et al. 2003).  Cl inical studies have not evaluated single-agent 
sirolimus for GVHD prophylaxis, and in fact, murine  data indicate that single-agent sirolimus 
potently abrogates CD8
+T cell mediated GVHD, but not CD4+T cell mediated GVHD (Blazar, 
1998).  As such, sirolimus may represent a repla cement of calcineurin inhibitor mediated GVHD 
prophylaxis.  In a study of matched sibling allotransplant in sickle cell anemia, sirolimus prevented both graft rejection and GVHD (Hsieh et al. 2009). Sirolimus was also reported to be 
well tolerated at a dosing schedule designed to maintain a level of 10, with hypertriglyceridemia 
representing the primary specific drug toxicity.
The use of tacrolimus for the suppression of GVHD has been supported by [CONTACT_510249][INVESTIGATOR_510149] (M arkus et al. 1991; Storb et al. 1993; Nash et al. 
1995; Fay et al. 1996).  Several phase III studies have prospectively compared tacrolimus to CSP 
with or without MTX in adolescent or adult pa tients undergoing related or unrelated SCT (Nash 
et al. 2000; Hiraoka et al. 2001). The incidences of grade II-IV acute GVHD were significantly 
decreased when patients were treated with tacrolimus.  The incidence of acute GVHD for 
patients receiving tacrolimus versus CSP ranged from 17.5% to 56% and 44.4% to 74%, 
respectively.  However, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of chronic GVHD between the groups.  Data from the first two tr ials revealed that the relapse rate and OS 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
were also similar between those receiving tacrolim us and CSA.  Both trials found that tacrolimus 
was well tolerated, but was associated with increased (but transient) nephrotoxicity that resolved 
over time.  Although the third tria l supported the previous two with regards to the decreased 
incidence of acute GVHD and relapse rate, the 2-year OS was worse in the arm receiving tacrolimus than cyclosporine, 50.4% and 40.5%, respectively.  When the DFS among patients 
with no advanced disease was compared, the outcomes were similar.  
Although sirolimus and tacrolimus both bind to FKBP12, the two drugs are not competitive and 
appear to be synergistic (Stepkowski et al. 1997).  To take advantage of this synergistic effect, 
the combination of the two drugs was evaluated in a trial using myeloablative HSCT with matched related or unrela ted donors at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Antin et al. 2003).  In 
that study the incidence of grade II-IV GVHD wa s markedly reduced compared to historical 
controls.

2.[ADDRESS_659547] blood bank can apply for 
licensure of UCB units. If the unit meets the criteria for licensure, then that unit can be distributed as a licensed produc t. However, starting October 20, 2011, units that do not meet 
the requirements are considered "unlicensed" and can only be distributed for transplant under an 
IND.
For those patients whose best cord blood option is  an unlicensed unit, the unit will be obtained 
under an IND which allows access to unlicensed cord blood units. For ease of access, the 
NMDP has developed a protocol  through which most unlicensed CBUs may be obtained. The 
corresponding NCI protocol number is 12-C-0027. Pa tients will be consented and signed on to 
this protocol, unless their CB is obtained from a non-participating cord  blood bank. Unlicensed 
CBs from non-participating cord blood banks will be  obtained through a single patient IND if 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_978], or through the bank’s own IND protocol, which will be submitted to the NCI IRB for review.

followed by:  1) severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm3) and bone marrow biopsy revealing a 
cellularity of less than 25% or 2) absen ce of donor cells in the marrow or blood as 
demonstrated by a chimerism assay without subsequent improvement occurring either 
spontaneously or after growth factor treatme nt.  Improvement is defined as ANC > 500/mm3
consistently.  Severe neutr openia with marrow cellularity > 25% is not secondary graft 
failure.
f) Aplasia: Less than 5% marrow cellularity as measured on bone marrow biopsy. 
3.1.6 Complication of Mixed Chimerism or  Persistent/Progressive Disease
a) Donor Lymphocyte Infusion: Patients with pe rsistent or progressive MDS post-HSCT, or 
mixed chimerism that does not improve after ta pering or discontinuing immune suppression 
may be eligible to receive donor lymphocytes (donor lymphocyte infusion, or “DLI”) or G-
CSF mobilized DLI if they can be obtained from the donor.  Additional lymphocytes will be collected by [CONTACT_22674]’s stem cell donor, either in steady state (i.e. no donor therapy) or after filgrastim.  DLI or mobilized DLI may be administered alone or after 
chemotherapy.
b) DLI may be sequentially administered for mixed chimerism or progression of the MDS at 
doses 1 -10 x 10

day +60 and every 30 days thereafter as deemed necessary.  If there is persistent mixed 
donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22566] (< 95% donor chime rism on whole blood, lymphoid, or myeloid 
subsets), recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510175] 2 or high er GVHD, patients will be eligible to receive 
DLI.  DLI may be repeated every 4 weeks wi th dose escalation as indicated above, until 
donor chimerism > 95% is achieved or until GVHD develops. 
e) Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510176] 2 or higher GVHD will be eligible to 
receive DLI every 4 weeks with dose escalati on as indicated above, until donor chimerism > 
95% is achieved or until GVHD develops. 
f) In addition to DLI, patients with persistent or  progressive disease may be offered therapy on 
other NCI protocols. Alternativel y, persistent or progressive di sease may be treated with any 
approved therapy thought to be in the best in terest of the patient including chemotherapy, 
radiation therapy, or monoclonal antibody therapy.

1. Equine ATG will be administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days (days 
-6, -5, -4) for a total dose of 90 mg/kg.  
2. Equine ATG will be infused IV over 4 hour s.  Infusion times may be extended up to 24 
hours to improve tolerance if necessary. 
3. An epi[INVESTIGATOR_510177]-Inj 0.3 mg (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_294366]) should be kept at bedside on days of equine 
ATG administration
4. Because of risk of allergic reaction to ATGAM , at least [ADDRESS_659563] infusion 
of ATGAM, patients will be tested with an intradermal injection of 0.1 ml of a 1:1000 dilution (5 μ g horse ATG) of ATGAM in sodium ch loride injection and a contralateral 
sodium chloride injection control.  The patient should be observed every [ADDRESS_659564] of care guidelines or receive a 24-hour infusion of ATG.
5. Subjects will receive pre-medication prior to Equine ATG infusion consisting of:  
xOral acetaminophen 650 mg
xOral diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV
The dosages of these drugs may be adjusted for weight based dosing if necessary 
following pediatric dosing recommendations.
Oral prednisone at 1mg/kg/day will begin on day -[ADDRESS_659565] dose of h-ATG for 
serum sickness prophylaxis, and will be continued at this dose for 10 days.  Thereafter, prednisone will be slowly tapered over the next 2 weeks until it is discontinued on day 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
+19.   Likewise, patients where it is clinically  indicated to use a shorter course or taper 
schedule will be dosed individually as clinically indicated.  Those patients who develop 
serum sickness may require a longer tapering schedule and will be dosed individually as clinically indicated.  Infusion reactions will be treated symptomatically (e.g. antiemetics, IV fluid hydration, acetaminophen, antihistamines, inhaled 
bronchodilators, and me peredine.  In cases of mode rate to severe reactions, 
hydrocortisone will be given and the infusion will be discontinued and restarted at a slower rate once the symptoms have subside d.  If a patient has a persistent severe 
infusion reaction that does not respond to meas ures to ameliorate the sings/symptoms 
associated with the infusion, the infusi on will be discontinued and further study 
participation will continue as planned with the exception that no further ATG will be administered.
d) The dose of Fludarabine will be dose adjusted for renal dysfunction. For Creatinine 
Clearance of 30-70 mL/min/1.73m
2, there will be a 20% dose reduction. If the Creatinine 
Clearance is less than 30mL/min/1.73m2, Fludarabine will not be administered.
e) Cyclophosphamide will be dosed on actual body we ight. Hydration will be carried out according 
to the NIH supportive care guidelines for the pr evention of hemorrhagic cystitis as outlined 
below. 
Background: 
Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a well documented complication of cyclophosphamide therapy. The 
mechanism of cyclophosphamide-induced HC is sec ondary to bladder wall damage from contact 
[CONTACT_510259].  The risk of cyclophosphamide-induced HC is 
greater with high dose cyclophosphamide regimens such as those employed in hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) preparative regimens.  Routine prevention strategies including intravenous hydration, forced diur esis, and mesna are imperative to reduce the risk of HC.  This 
guideline is intended to provide a consistent approach to HC prevention in patients receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide in chemotherapy prepar ative regimens prior to HSCT at the NIH. 
Definitions: 
High-dose cyclophosphamide : There is no absolute cut off for defining a dose of 
cyclophosphamide that would necessitate an ag gressive strategy for HC prevention. 
Cyclophosphamide doses employed in HSCT prepar ative regimens at the NIH that equal or 
exceed 50 to 60 mg/kg/dose OR 1200 mg/m
2/dose should always be accompanied by [CONTACT_510260]. 
xIntravenous hydration should be initiated at a minimum of [ADDRESS_659566] dose 
of cyclophosphamide
xThe rate of intravenous infusion for hydration is 0.9% Sodium Chloride Inj with 10 mEq / 
liter of potassium chloride infused at a rate of 90 mL/m 2/hour. 
xContinue hydration until [ADDRESS_659567] cyclophosphamide infusion. 
xFurosemide 20mg intravenously will be given once daily - Adult Patients Only -
(preferably in the AM hours) on a schedul ed basis on the days of cyclophosphamide 
administration to maintain diuresis.  Pediatric patients may receive furosemide as 
clinically indicated at a dose of 1mg/kg up to a maximum of 20 mg. (Furosemide doses may be adjusted based on patient weight, di uretic response or othe r clinical factors; 
oMonitor intake and output closely (2 hour intervals).  Accurate documentation of 
intake and output is essentia l to make good clinical decisions regarding diuresis. 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
oIf fluid intake exceeds urine output by  500 ml (10 ml/kg for pediatric patients < 
50 kg) over an 8 hour period, an additional 20 mg of furosemide (1mg/kg for 
pediatric patients up to a maximum of 20 mg) will be administered intravenously. 
Notify PI/LAI when PRN doses of furosemide are administered. 
oAdditional doses of furosemide maybe administered as needed for weight gain due to fluid retention. In general, furosemide doses should be separated by [CONTACT_2669] a four hour observation interval. 
oNotify PI/LAI if patient’s input is greater than output by 1 liter (20 ml/kg for pediatric patients < 50 kg) in an 8 hour period during cyclophosphamide 
hydration. 
oStop IV hydration ([ADDRESS_659568] cyclophosphamide dose). 
xMESNA 
For detoxification of acrolein, the urotoxic  metabolite of cycl ophosphamide, Mesna will
be given in a dose equal to that of cyclophosphamide. Total MESNA dose should = the 
cyclophosphamide dose. Mesna will be administered as a continuous intravenous 
infusion over 24 hours on each day that cyclophosphamide is administered. The initial 
bag of mesna should be started concurrently with the start of cyclophosphamide. 
Example: For preparative regimens that  dose cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/day, the 
MESNA will also be given at a dose of 60 mg/kg administered as a continuous 
intravenous infusion over [ADDRESS_659569] dose 
of cyclophosphamide. The entire MESNA dose pr escribed should be administered each 
day of cyclophosphamide therapy 
3.2.5 GVHD Prophylaxis with Sirolimus

18 years of age. In pediatric patients >40 kg the loading dose will be 6 mg. In pediatric 
patients <40kg, the loading dose will be 3mg/m2. 
d) Sirolimus will be administered each day in the morning.
e) From days -[ADDRESS_659570]-transplant, Sirolimus dosin g will be Rapamune 
tablets, 4 mg, p.o., each day in adult patients.  In pediatric patients > 40 kg the initial dose 
will be 2 mg every 24 hours.  For patients < 40 kg, the initial dose will be 1 mg/m2.  This 
may be delayed or held during the peri-engraftment phase for severe oral mucositis or delayed platelet engraftment. Sirolimus dose s hould be adjusted to maintain a target 
therapeutic concentration of 10 ng/L  with a range of 5 to 15 ng/L. 
f) In haploidentical blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510180], 4 mg, p.o.,

platelet engraftment. Sirolimus dose should be ad justed to maintain a target therapeutic 
concentration of 10 ng/L with a range of 5 to 15 ng/L
g) Sirolimus levels will be drawn on a Monday,  Thursday. For sirolimus levels, 2.5 cc of 
blood will be collected into EDTA tubes a nd analyzed at the NIH Clinical Center.
h) Because sirolimus has a long half-life (appr oximately 60 hours), si rolimus levels should 
be monitored once per week beyond day [ADDRESS_659571] exposure to biologically significant levels of sirolimus.
i) The total dose of sirolimus will continue w ith tapering beginning at day +180. (+/- two 
days) unless clinically indicated per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106].
j) The initial Sirolimus dosing maybe adjusted if clinically indicated for known drug 
interactions that cannot be avoided.
3.2.6 GVHD Prophylaxis with Tacrolimusa) Tacrolimus will be used as the second ag ent in the immunosuppressive regimen, and in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510181], Tacrolimus  
will be initiated on day -3 befo re transplant as a continuous intravenous infusion at 0.02 
mg/kg/day for a target level of 5 to 10 ng/ml
b) For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510182], Tacrolimus will be administered 
continuously from 
day +5.
c) When the patient is reliably taking oral me dications, tacrolimus will be converted to an 
equivalent oral dose using a 1:3 conversion from the IV form.  The total daily dose will be divided into two equal doses, one dose given approximately every 12 hours.
d) The total dose of tacrolimus will continue with tapering starting at day +180, unless clinically 
indicated per PI.
e) The initial Tacrolimus dosing may be adjusted if clinically indicated for known drug 
interactions that cannot be avoided.
3.2.7 GVHD Prophylaxis with Cyclophosphamid e for Haploiden tical Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]
a) Cyclophosphamide will be used as the third agent in the immunosuppressive regimen for 
haploidentical recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510183] +3 and +4 after transplant as an infusion over 90 min. 
b) Cyclophosphamide will be accompanied by [CONTACT_510263] 80% of cyclophosphamide dose in 4 
divided doses on day +3, the day of high dose cyclophosphamide.
c) Tacrolimus and Sirolimus will be started on day +[ADDRESS_659572] Transplant Treatment  with Filgrastim (G-CSF)
Filgrastim will be administered at a dose of 5 micrograms/kg/day IV starting on day [ADDRESS_659573]  blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and on day +[ADDRESS_659574] Modifications
a) The dose of filgrastim for ma tched related donor st em cell mobilization will not be changed 
from a dose of 10 Pg/kg/day by [CONTACT_22666].  
b) There will be no additional dose of filgrastim if a sixth day of apheresis is performed. 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
c) For apheresis an additional 12 L apheresis may be performed on day 6 if the target dose of 5 
x 106CD34_+ cells/kg is not reached on the day 5 collection.
d) If greater than 5 x 106 CD34+ cells per kg are harvested after apheresis, then no further 
mobilization or apheresis will be performed, and the patient will be eligible to receive the 
stem cell transplant with that dose of CD34+ cells. 
e) In the event that < 3 x 106 CD34+ cells per kg are harves ted, the donor will be given two 
weeks of rest, and then will be re-treated with filgrastim 8 μg/kg subcutaneously BID for five 
days followed by [CONTACT_510264].
f) If the donor stem cells are cryopreserved, th e apheresis product will be cryopreserved in 
Plasmalyte A, Pentastarch, human serum al bumin, DMSO, and preservative free heparin 
(10U/ml). In the event that unrelated donor cells are to be collected and cryopreserved prior 
to transplant, permission will be obtained from the NMDP.
g) If an ABO incompatibility exists between th e donor and patient, the donor erythrocytes will 
be removed from the graft in the cell-proce ssing laboratory, according to standard DTM 
operating procedures.
h) Bone marrow may also be obtained from the donor if conditioning has already begun and the 
PBSC collection is not to be carried out or results in a suboptimal collection. 
3.3.2 Transplant Treatment Modificationa) If donor apheresis on days 5, 6, and 7 yields a to WDORI[
6CD34+cells per kg, this level 
of CD34+cell dose will be allowed.  
b) If PBSC cell transplant results in DMSO-related toxicities (chills, muscle aches), 
diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_659575] less th an 1% donor neutrophils 
in the peripheral blood on two occasions more than one month apart and occurring more than one month after transplant will be c onsidered to have graft rejection. 
3.3.4 Dose Modification for Sirolimusa) The total duration of sirolimus will be determined by [CONTACT_510265]/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22566], however the schedule is to continue sirolimus until 
day +180 (+/- 2 days) and then taper as long as the severity of GVHD is less than grade II, and the patient is not requiring systemic steroids.  Sirolimus will subsequently be reduced by [CONTACT_31806]-third on day +180 (+/- 2 days  as long as the severity of GVHD is less than grade II, the patient is not receiving systemic steroids, and the donor chimerism is 100 percent. If the 
donor chimerism is less than 100%, sirolimus w ill be continued without taper for up to 2 
years at the discretion of the PI.
b) Because prolonged dosing of sirolimus is associated with increased cholesterol and 
triglycerides, a lipid panel that includes chol esterol and triglyceride s should be measured 
every 2 weeks during sirolimus therapy.  If elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels are documented on two consecutive tests, therap y with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor 
(“statin” therapy) will be initiated. Since the patients will be on Fluconazole, it is recommended to start Pravastatin 40 mg/day. In the event that this 40 mg daily dose is not sufficient (elevation of cholesterol or triglyce rides at a level 50% above baseline values), 
then consideration may be given to increase the dose of the Pravastatin therapy to 80 mg. 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
3.3.5 Dose Modification for Tacrolimus
a) Subsequent doses of tacrolimus will be adjusted according to levels monitored at least bi-
weekly and/or upon symptoms or alterations in renal function. The target level will be 5 to 10 
ng/ml
b) When the patient is reliably taking oral me dications, tacrolimus will be converted to an 
equivalent oral dose using a 1:3 conversion from the IV form.  The total daily dose will be divided into two equal doses, one dos e given approximately every 12 hours.
c) The total dose of tacrolimus will continue until day +180 and then begin tapering until day +
365 (+/- two days), per PI [INVESTIGATOR_510184], 
and the patient is not requ iring systemic steroids.

4.2 M ANAGEMENT OF ENGRAFTMENT SYNDROME  
Engraftment syndrome may occur at the time of neut rophil recovery.  Its c linical manifestations 
include noninfectious fever, ras h, and vascular leak causing non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, 
weight gain, and renal insufficiency (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626] 2001).  Diagnostic criteria and a treatment schema 
for engraftment syndrome are included in Appendix E. 
4.[ADDRESS_659597] DISEASE
a) In patients in whom GVHD is suspected, standa rd clinical criteria and biopsy findings (when 
clinically indicated) will be used to establish the diagnosis. Acute GVHD will be assessed 
according to 1994 Consensus Conference on Acut e GVHD Grading criteria (Przepi[INVESTIGATOR_20360]. 
1995). Chronic GVHD will be assessed acco rding to [ADDRESS_659598] (Filipovich et al. 2005). See Appendix D for details concerning the assessment of 
acute and chronic GVHD.
b) Patients with clinical Stage 1 or 2 (Grade I) GVHD of the skin without any other organ 
involvement will be treated with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_510198].
c) In general, patients with tGrade II acute GVHD will be treated with high-dose, systemic 
corticosteroids.
d) Patients who fail to respond to corticosteroids will be considered for second-line 
immunosuppressive therapy. These agents incl ude Tacrolimus as a continuous intravenous 
infusion at 0.02 mg/kg/day; Mycophenolic acid 1 Gm po BID,  Infliximab (Remicade) 10 mg/kg/dose IV every week for a maximum of 4 doses, Daclizumab 1mg/kg IV on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22, or  other exper imental acute GVHD protocol s, if they are available.

c) Pre-menopausal women who have not undergone hysterec tomy will be placed on a 
monophasic oral contraceptive to provide both menses suppression and contraception. This 
therapy will begin upon enrollment and continue un til platelet recovery after transplantation 
(> 50,000/ μl without transfusion).  Treatment should be starte d prior to the onset of 
thrombocytopenia usually when withdrawal bl eeding begins. Once thrombocytopenia occurs 
therapy is less likely to be effective. As general recommendations: Prescribe Lo-Ovral (300μ g norgestrol and 30 μg ethinyl estradiol) [ADDRESS_659599] patient not to take 
placebo tablets. If the patient is on another oral  contraceptive, she should be switched to Lo-
Ovral. If Lo-Ovral is started when the patient is bleeding and bleeding persists for more than 2-3 days, increase the dose to 1 tablet twice dail y. If bleeding persists for more than an 
additional 2-3 days (total 5 to 6 days after starting hormones), consult the NIH Gynecology 
Consult Service.

platelets > 10,000/mm3(or higher, if clinically indicated).  
b) All blood products, with the exception of the st em cell product and DLI, will be irradiated.
c) Leukocyte filters will be utilized for all blood and platelet tran sfusions to decrease 
sensitization to transfused leukocytes and decr ease the risk of CMV infection. The patient, 
who is seronegative for CMV and whose donor is seronegative, should receive CMV-
negative blood products whenever possible.
d) Transfusion of irradiated blood and cellula r blood products will begin at a minimum of two 
weeks prior to hematopoietic cell collection. Transfusion of irradiated blood and cellular 
blood products will continue to at least one ye ar after transplanta tion. Patients receiving 
immunosuppressive medica tion will continue to have all blood and cellular blood products 
irradiated until discontinuation of immunosuppressi ve treatment.
e) Patients sensitized to HLA or platelet specific antigens should receive HLA matched 
apheresis platelet collections.

All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 3.0.
5.4 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
a) The primary objectives of this feasibility study are:
1) In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510136], to determine whether reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT results in 
engraftment and restores nor mal hematopoiesis by [CONTACT_4475] + 100 in patients with GATA2 
mutation syndrome 
2) To determine the safety of this HSCT regimen in patients with GATA2 mutation 
syndrome, including transplant related toxicity , the incidence of acute and chronic graft-
versus-host disease, immune reconstitution, ove rall survival, and di sease-free survival 
b) Up to [ADDRESS_659610] six patients w ith mutations in GATA2 who are candidates for 
transplant.  This study utilizes a matched re lated donor if one is pr esent, however if no 
matched related donor  is identified, but a 10/10 matched unrelated donor is available, then 
that donor will be utilized. If neither a 10/ 10 matched related dono r nor a 10/10 matched 
unrelated donor is available, then either a 9/10 matched unrelated donor, a haploidentical 
donor or UCB units will be used if they ar e available and meet the dose and matching 
requirements.  The choice between a 9/10 matched unrelated donor, an UCB donor, or a 
haploidentical donor will de pend upon the nature of the HLA mismatch, the clinical 
condition of the patient, and the urgency for tran splant among other factors.  This decision 
whether to use a 9/10 matched unrelated donor, an UCB donor, or a haploidentical donor will 
be made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_22584].
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
c) It is estimated that approximately one-quarter of the patients with GATA2 deficiency will 
have a 10/[ADDRESS_659611] a 10/[ADDRESS_659612] 
9/[ADDRESS_659613] blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]
d) Our goal is to learn if the approach is likely to be of beneficial and have an acceptable level 
of toxicity.  The definition of benefit is whether the patient engrafts the donor HSC and 
normal hematopoiesis is reconstituted.  For purposes of sample  size calculations, we will aim 
for 50% with benefit and consider  this procedure to be of less benefit if fewer than half 
(50%) may truly benefit.  As an illustration, we  will aim for 50% with benefit and consider 
the results to be less promising if consistent with only 20% having benefit. If there are [ADDRESS_659614] to  type of donor, the probability of having 6 or 
more with a successful outcome is 6.1% if the true probability of bene fit were 20% and the 
probability is 84.9% if the true probability of benefit were 50%.  Thus, observation of benefit 
in 6 or more of 15 patients provides evidence that this method is likely to be useful for these patients. At the conclusion of the trial, 90% and 95% confidence intervals will be formed around the observed benefit results.  Given the rarity  of this condition, this is intended to be a 
guideline, but findings of lesser benefit may be considered useful for fu rther consideration if 
the toxicity profile is not excessively negative.
e) Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: Although the patients w ith this disease are debilitated from the 
immunodeficiency disease and the frequency of infections, we anticipate that most will 
survive the transplant itself.  The following st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_510206]: 1) Separately within each donor category, if two patients fail to engraft, or fail to survive the 
first [ADDRESS_659615], then we will stop enrollment, reevaluate the protocol, and 
present this data to the IRB.
2) If while accrual is proceeding, if 1/[ADDRESS_659616] a grade 3 or higher 
GVHD, this will also pause accrual to the trial,  including IRB review, prior to re-starting 
accrual or amending the trial appropriately.

ATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
In accordance with NCI IRB policy, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_510207] a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).
The PI, LAI, and Scientific Chairperson will pr ovide continuous, close monitoring, with prompt 
reporting of serious adverse events to the IRB.  On a weekly basis, the PI, LAI, Protocol 
Research Nurse, and the NCI Transplant Coordinator will review clinical and laboratory data from patient. A complete summary of patient outcomes will be provided every six months to the IRB in the form of a continuing review appli cation.  The research nurse will verify enrollment 
data entered into the C3D for each subject with in 4 weeks of signing consent.  Ongoing data 
entered into C3D will be verified by [CONTACT_510272], and at the time of continuing review.  Documentation of data verification will be tracked in C3D.

Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659617] SELECTION
Subjects for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_510208]2 and a life-expectan cy of greater than 3 months but less than 24 
months.  The GATA2 mutation syndrome is characterized by: 1) the onset of disease beyond infancy with least two epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] a life-threaten ing opportunistic infection including MAC, 2) a 
unique T+, B-, NK-, monocyte- phenotype on flow cy tometry, 3)  propensity to progress to 
MDS/AML, and 4) mutations in the GATA2 gene .  This patient group was chosen because 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem ce ll transplant represents a potentia lly effective treatment for both 
GATA2 mutations and MDS.  There are no treatment options for patients with this disease that provide any significant survival advantage. The approximate survival of these patients with conventional treatment is approximately five years. Because myeloablative preparative regimens 
are associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality in patients with co-morbidities, such individuals are most likely to benefit from the reduced-intensity transplant approach used in this study.  Individuals with HIV disease will not be candidates for this protocol due to the high rate 
of post-transplant complications in this group.  In dividuals who are pregnant  or lactating will not 
be candidates for this protocol due to the risk to the fetus or newborn.
Information about this pr otocol will be posted on www.clinicaltrials.gov , NIH Clinical Center 
studies, and the NCI Patient recruitment websites. The protocol will also be listed in the 
physician’s data query (PDQ).

suppression is associated with an increased risk  of opportunistic infec tions.  However, it is 
anticipated that these risks will be lower than the risks associated with traditional allogeneic transplantation utilizing total body irradiation in which the mortality may be as high as 40%.  Although our data as well as that of others sugg est a significant reduction in transplant related 
mortality with reduced-intensity conditioning, the procedure nevertheless carries significant risk.  
It is therefore only appropriate to carry out th is experimental procedure in the context of

disease, and disease relapse.  Of these co mplications, GVHD remains the major cause of 
morbidity and mortality.  Therefore, the patient will receive sirolimus (Rapamycin) and 
tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis.  It is not known  whether study recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510209].  The major disc omforts of sirolimus and/or tacrolimus are: 
nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, fever and malaise, and intolerance of the period of confinement (see 
section 8.2 and 8.3 for full toxicity profile).  Si de effects of those drugs novel to reduced-
intensity transplantation are described in detail in Section 8.
6.2.2 Risks related to matche d related donor transplant
Engraftment is more predictable using a 10/10 matched donor transplant than with a 9/10-
matched unrelated donor transplant.  Treatment with both total bod y irradiation and fludarabine 
is designed to enhance donor engraftment to greater than 90%.  Graft-versus-host disease 
remains a formidable risk with  approximately 50% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_110861], and 25% of 
patients having GVHD requiring additional treatment.  The risk of GVHD is least with a 
matched related donor compared to the other two donor sources. 
6.2.3 Risks related to matche d unrelated donor transplant
Engraftment is also predictable using a 10/ 10 matched unrelated d onor transplant with 
approximately 90% or more of patients achieving engraftment. Treatment with both total body 
irradiation and fludarabine, and the increase to 300 cGy TBI for 9/[ADDRESS_659622] disease remains a formidable risk 
with approximately 60% of pa tients developi[INVESTIGATOR_510210], and 30% of patients having 
GVHD requiring additional treatment.  The risk of  GVHD is greater with a matched unrelated 
donor than with a ma tched related donor. 
6.2.4 Risks Related to Haploidentical TransplantHaploidentical donor transplant with this conditioning regimen results in 90% or more of 
patients achieving engraftment.  The risk of  GVHD using a haploidentical donor and this 
conditioning regimen is approximately 50%,  however only 10% have grade [ADDRESS_659623] common include nausea and 
mucositis. There also exists a risk of hypothyroidism, cataracts, interstitial pneumonitis, nephropathy, and an unspecified long term risk  of developi[INVESTIGATOR_510211] (Buchali 
et al. 2000) (Deeg et al. 1983).  Importantly, the majority of the non-neoplastic effects were 
subclinical and/or reversible (Thomas et al. 20 01).  Studies attempting to evaluate the risk 
induced by [CONTACT_510273] a higher rate of solid tumors after radiation-based 
regimens.  Curtis et al. reported on 19,229 patien ts and found a cumulative incidence rate of 
2.2% at 10 years, and 6.7% at 15 years, with higher  doses of TBI associated with a higher risk of 
solid cancers (Curtis et al. 1997).  In a study in  1999, no relationship could be found to radiation 
but the highest risk factor was felt to be the pr esence of chronic graft versus host disease, and 
long-term treatment with cyclosporine (Kolb et al. 1999). Pediatric patients who require sedation

6.3 R ISKS IN RELATION TO BENEFIT 
6.3.1 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:
Patients on this study may be directly benefited by [CONTACT_510274].  Considerable clinical data has demonstrated long-t erm disease-free survival for patients with immunodeficiency 
diseases as well as high-risk hematological ma lignancies following alloge neic HSCT.  Thus, the 
patient on this study may be direct ly benefited by [CONTACT_201745].  In particular, reduced-intensity

Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659625] benefit (45 CFR 46.102).  The potential 
risks to the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510212].  The risks graft rejection, 
acute and chronic GVHD, infection, and relapse will be present, as discussed previously.
6.3.2 Donors:
Healthy 10/10 matched related donors, 10/10 matched unrelated donors,9/[ADDRESS_659626] of 
this protocol is not investiga tional. There is potential benef it for donors, as they may derive
psychological benefit from participating in a clinical trial designed to improve the health of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_510213]. Other potential benefits incl ude the diagnosis of 
previously unknown illnesses (such as viral hepatitis) at the time of donor screening.
6.4 C
ONSENT AND ASSENT PROCESSES AND DOCUMENTS
a) Informed consent will be obtained from all patients, and/or the patient’s parents or legal 
guardian (if he/she is < 18 years of age), and matched related donors ente red on this trial.  
The procedures and treatments involved in this  protocol, with their attendant risks and 
discomforts, potential benefits, and potential alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_510214]/or parent/guardian.  If applicable, the parent or guardian will sign the designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the child has given assent.
b) The investigators are requesting a waiver from the IRB to allow only one parent to sign the 
informed consent to enter a child on the protocol. Because many patients must travel to the NIH from long distances at substantial expens e, requiring both parents to be present for the 
consent process could be a financial hardship for many families. When necessary, the protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_510275]. When guardianship status of the child is uncertain, a social worker will be asked to investigate and, if necessary, seek documentation of custody status. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_510215]. Where deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_83953]’s parents or guardian, the child will also be included in all discussions about the 
trial and verbal assent will be obtained. The parent or guardian will sign the designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the child has given assent.
c) Similarly, the procedures and tr eatments involved in this protoc ol, with their attendant risks 
and discomforts, will be carefully explained to  the matched unrelated donors at the respective 
donor center as required by [CONTACT_510276].  The original signed informed consent goes to Medical Records; a copy will be kept for the research record.  The Central Registration Office (CRO), 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
Data Management Section will also retain a copy of the informed consent document.  A copy 
of the signed informed consent document will also be given to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (and matched related donor, when applicable).  b) The Central Registration Of fice (CRO) will ascertain the 
date of IRB approval before registering the first patient. 
d) The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or an authorized designee will consent the patient and 
matched related donor (when applicable) and will be available to answer all patient questions.
e) If any new information becomes available relating to risks, adverse events, or toxicities, 
while patients are participating in this protocol, this information will be provided orally and/or in writing to all enrolled and prospective patient participants.  Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if necessary the info rmed consent amended to reflect relevant 
information.
6.4.1 Telephone re-consent procedure
Reconsent on this study may be obtained via telephone according to the following procedure: the 
informed consent document will be sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be 
provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form.  
The subject will sign and date the informed consent. A witness to the subject’s signature [CONTACT_110730].  The original informed consent document will be sent back to the consenting investigator who will sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was obtained via telephone.

7.1.2 Suspected adverse reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For th e purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.
7.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the sp ecificity or severity that  has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not cons istent with the risk information 
described in the general inve stigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug und er investigation.
7.1.4 Serious An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety , welfare or rights of subjects or others.
7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
xDeath,
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience
xInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_471065]/incapacity
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect.
xImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require

e) Toxicities – Fludarabine toxicities include myelosuppression ( dose limiting toxicity), fever, 
nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, anorexia, edema, skin 
rashes, myalgia, headache, agitation, hearing loss, transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_510216], auto-immune hemolytic anemia, auto -immune thrombocytopenia, paresthesias, 
peripheral neuropathy, renal, and pulmonary toxicity (interstitial pneumonitis).  Severe fatal CNS toxicity presenting with loss of vision and progressive deterioratio n of mental status 
were encountered almost exclusively after ve ry high doses of fludarabine monophosphate.  
Such toxicity has only rarely been demonstrated at the 25-30 mg/m
2/day dosage of 
fludarabine.  Very rarely described complicat ions include transfusion-associated graft-
versus-host disease, thrombotic thrombocytope nic purpura, and liver failure.  Tumor lysis 
syndrome following fludarabine administration ha s been observed, especially in patients with 
advanced bulky disease.  Opportunistic infecti ons (protozoan, viral, fungal, and bacterial) 
have been observed post-fludarabine, especially in heavily pre-treated individuals, and in 
individuals receiving fludarabine combined with other agent.
f) Dose reduction for renal impairment- For Creatinine Clearance of 30-70 mL/min/1.73m2 
there will be a 20% dose reduction. If th e Creatinine Clearance is less than 
30mL/min/1.73m2, Fludarabine w ill not be administered.  
8.2 S IROLIMUS (RAPAMUNE ®)
a) General:  Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant th at is FDA approved for use in combination 
with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for pr ophylaxis of organ rejection after kidney 
transplant. Sirolimus is administered SIROLIMUS (Rapamycin) (Rapamune®, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories)
b) Supply - For patient administrati on, oral tablets will be purchased  by [CONTACT_22699]. 
c) Storage and Stability - Oral tablets should be  stored 20-25 C° (68-77 F°). Oral solution 
should be refrigerated (2-8 C° or 36-46 F°).
d) Administration: Because fatty food can increase the absorption of sirolimus, the tablets 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_659633] to 
fat content.
e) Toxicities: 1) Sirolimus induces immune suppression, which has been associated with 
opportunistic infection and an increased rate of malignancy, particularly skin cancer. 2) Some 
individuals may develop hypersensitivity to sirolimus.  3) May cause an increase in cholesterol and triglycerides, which may be associated with pancreatitis.  4) With long-term administration, may result in imp aired renal function.  4) Co-a dministration of  voriconazole 
is strongly discouraged on this protocol, as the combination of voriconazole and sirolimus results in an approximate 10-fold increase in sirolimus blood levels. 
f) Drug Interactions: May increase the in vivo drug levels of simvastatin.
8.3 T
ACROLIMUS (FK506, P ROGRAF )
a) Supply: Tacrolimus will be obtained by [CONTACT_153518] H Clinical Center Pharmacy Department from 
commercial sources and is availa ble in capsules (0.5 mg, 1mg, and 5mg), and as a parenteral 
concentrate for injection (5 mg/ml, 1 ml ampules).  
b) Preparation: For parenteral doses, tacrolimu s injection concentrate (5 mg/ml) should be 
diluted to a final concentration of 0.004 to 0.02 mg/ml in dextrose 5% in water or sodium 
chloride 0.9%.   Parenteral doses of tacrolimus will be prepared in non-PVC containers and 
infused with non-PVC admin istration sets/tubing.  
c) Storage and Stability: Capsules and ampules of parenteral concentrate bear expi[INVESTIGATOR_510217].  Tacro limus concentrate for injection that has been 
diluted to a final concentration of 0.004 to 0.02 mg/ml is stable for 24 hours in 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride injection in glass, PVC or non-PVC plastic containers.  To minimize the potential for sorption to PVC plastic bags and tubing as well the leaching of phthalate plasticizer (DEHP) into the solution, only non-PVC plastic bags and intravenous 
administration sets should be utilized.  
d) Administration: Tacrolimus may be given intravenously over 24 hours or orally.   
e) Toxicities: Acute tacrolimus nephrotoxicity is usually manifested by a moderate decline in 
renal excretory function, which is  readily reversible by a decrease in drug dosage.  Although 
some degree of transient renal dysfunction may occur in patients with therapeutic levels of tacrolimus, significant renal toxicity is associated with elevated trough or steady state levels.  In addition to an increase in BUN and creatinine, hyperkalemic hyperchloremic acidosis, low fractional excretion of sodium and the onset of hypertension with hypomagnesemia are seen 
with tacrolimus nephrotoxicity. Insulin dependent post transplant diabetes mellitus was reported in 20% kidney transplant  patients, which was reversible  in 50% of the patients at [ADDRESS_659634] transplant.  Hypertension occurs in up to 60% of patients.   Hypomagnesaemia can 
be associated with neurologic symptoms, including seizures, cerebellar ataxia and 
depression.  Dose-related hepatotoxicity, manifested by [CONTACT_510278], has been reported. The drug carries a warning for increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma may result from resulting immunosuppression.

filgrastim is not recommended.  Dilution of filgrastim to a final concentration of less than 5Pg/ml is not recommended at any time.  Do not dilute with saline at  any time; product may 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].  Filgrastim diluted to concentrations between 5 and 15 Pg/ml should be protected 
from absorption to plastic materials by [CONTACT_22695] (Human) to a final 
concentration of 2mg/ml.  When diluted in 5% dextrose or 5% dextrose plus Albumin 
(Human), filgrastim is compatible with glass bottles, PVC and polyolefin IV bags, and polypropylene syringes.  The dose may be “r ounded down” to within  10% of patient’s 
calculated dose to use the drug cost-effectively.
c) Storage and Stability – Filgrastim for injection should be stored in the refrigerator at 2
oto 
8oC (36oto 46oF).  Avoid shaking.  
d) Administration – Subcutaneous injection is preferred.  If clinically indicated, filgrastim may 
be administered as an intrav enous infusion over 4 or 24 hours.
e) Toxicities – Medullary bone or skeletal pain is the most co mmonly reported toxicity.  In 
addition, reversible elevations in uric acid, lactate dehydrog enase, and alkaline phosphatase 
are common laboratory abnormalities.  Four case s of splenic rupture have been reported in 
healthy donors when given filgrastim or other myeloid growth factors for peripheral blood 
stem cell mobilization; [ADDRESS_659635] been reported in cancer patient s undergoing chemotherapy or peripheral blood 
stem cell mobilization; splenic rupture may have contributed to deaths in 2 of these cases.  
One additional death due to splenic rupture after filgrastim therapy was reported to the manufacturer without additional information.  According to the manufacturer, the reporting 
rate for splenic rupture with filgrastim is less than 1 in 486,000.

c) Storage and Stability: Oral tablets and oral suspension should be stored at 15oto 30oC (59oto 
86oF) in a dry place and protected from light.  TMP/SMX for injection should be stored at 
room temperature between 15oto 30oC (59oto 86oF) and should not be refrigerated.  Stability 
of intravenous doses after final dilution is de pendent on concentration and diluent.  Consult 
with pharmacy for questions regarding stability and expi[INVESTIGATOR_22626]. 
d) Administration – Oral and pare nteral.  Parenteral doses s hould be administered by [CONTACT_257457] 60 to 90 minutes. 
e) Toxicities: 1) the most common adverse effects from TMP/SMX are gastrointestinal 
disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria).  2) Fatalities associ ated with the administration of sulfonamides, although rare, 
have occurred due to severe reactions, includi ng Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_7387], fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranul ocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood 
dyscrasias.  3) For TMP/SMX injection, local  reaction, pain and slight irritation upon IV 
administration are infrequent.  Thro mbophlebitis has rarely been observed.
8.9 U
RSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID (URSODIOL ,ACTIGALL®)
a) Supply – Commercially available as 300 mg capsules.b) Pharmacology - About 90% of a therapeutic dose of Ursodiol is absorbed in the small bowel 
after oral administration. After absorption, Ur sodiol enters the portal vein and undergoes 
efficient extraction from portal blood by [CONTACT_510282]. Only small quantities of Ursodiol appear in the systemic circulation and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The sites of the drug’s therapeutic actions are in the liver, bile, and gut lumen.
c) Storage and Stability – Oral capsules shoul d be stored at 15°C-30°C (59°F-86°F).
d) Administration – Oral.e) Toxicities – Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, me tallic taste, abdominal pain, biliary pain, 
cholecystitis, constipation, stomatitis, flatulence, di arrhea, pruritus, rash, dry skin, urticaria, 
headache, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders. Less common side effects include 
sweating, thinning of hair, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, rhinitis, cough.
f) Drug Interactions - Bile acid sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol may 
interfere with the action of Ursodiol by [CONTACT_510283]. Aluminum-based antacids 
have been shown to adsorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with Ursodiol 
in the same manner as the bile acid sequestering agents. Estrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate increase hepatic cholesterol se cretion, and encourage cholesterol gallstone 
formation and hence may counteract the effectiveness of Ursodiol.

ml 0.9% sodium chloride, Inj., and given at a dose of 50 mg/kg as an IVPB over 2 hours on day -6. .e) Toxicities:1) Nausea and vomiting - variable; symptomatically improved with standard antiemetics 
and/or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] [e.g., lorazepam].
2) Water retention – cyclophosphamide may rare ly provoke the syndrome of inappropriate 
antidiuretic hormone secretion and resultant hyponatremia, usually manifested 12-48 hrs 
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
after IV administration, necessita ting frequent accurate assessm ent [q 1-2 hrs] of intake, 
urine output and urine specific gravity. This effect can be counteracted by [CONTACT_22691]. 
Fluid restriction is not feasible during administration of high dose cyclophosphamide.
3) Cardiomyopathy - cyclophosphamide may cause severe, sometimes le thal, hemorrhagic 
myocardial necrosis or congestive cardiomy opathy. Patients may present with congestive 
cardiomyopathy as late as [ADDRESS_659636] dose of cyclophosphamide. The clinical 
syndrome has been observed in patients receiving the dose of cyclophosphamide used in 
this protocol. In an attempt to minimize this complication, patie nts with significant 
cardiac dysfunction are excluded from this pr otocol [see patient eligibility]. Congestive 
failure is managed according to standard medical therapeutics.
4) Hemorrhagic cystitis – this is a serious, potentially life-threatening complication related 
to injury of the bladder epi[INVESTIGATOR_510219].
5) Although sub-clinical hematuria is not uncommon at this dose level, clinically significant 
hematuria or serious hemorrhage can usually be avoided by [CONTACT_117354] a high urine 
volume and frequent voidings and the administra tion of Mesna. Diuresis is maintained 
for [ADDRESS_659637] dose by [CONTACT_22692]. Careful monitoring of serum and urine electrolytes is mandated. 
Furosemide may be required to ensure this di uresis. Continuous bladder irrigation may be 
used for control of significant hematuria.
6) Sterility7) Less common but serious complications in clude pulmonary fibrosis and secondary 
malignancies. Less common but reversible toxicities include alopecia and skin rash.

Treatment of Acute GVHD
This schema is intended to se rve as a guideline and to promote consistency in our clinical 
practice; it may be modified for individual pa tients as clinical circumstances warrant.
Grade 0-I GVHD: 
1) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (usually 0.1% triamci nolone; 1% hydrocortisone to face) applied to 
rash BID.
Grade II-IV GVHD:1) Methylprednisolone (MP) 1 mg/kg per dose IV, BID for 4 consecutive days.2) If no response after 4 days, continue until response (7-day maximum trial); the dose may be 
doubled (4 mg/kg/day).
3) If response within 7 days, taper as follows:
a) 0.75 mg/kg per dose IV BID for 2 days.b) 0.5 mg/kg per dose IV BID for 2 days.c) 0.375 mg/kg per dose IV BID for 2 days.d) If clinically appropriate, change MP to oral prednisone to equivalent of IV dose) daily for 
2 days.  MP may be converted to prednisone  later in the taper at the investigators’ 
discretion.
e) After this, steroids will be reduced by 10% of  starting oral dose each week until a dose of 
10 mg/day is reached.  Subsequent reductions will be made at the investigators’ discretion.
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
f) If GVHD worsens during taper, steroids should be increased to previous dose.
g) During steroid taper, maintain cyclos porine at therapeutic levels (Section 3.5.1).
4) If no response is observed within 7 days of MP treatment:
a) Increase Methylprednisolone to 10 mg/kg per dose IV, BID for 2 days.
b)If there is no improvement, consideration will be given to using second-line immunosuppressive therapy, e.g., tacrolimus,  mycophenolic acid, monoclonal antibodies, 
or studies of investigational agents for acute GVHD, if they are available.
5) Antifungal prophylaxis with agents effectiv e against mould will be started when it is 
anticipated that the patient will be receiving st eroids at > 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone 
(or equivalent) for > 2 weeks. Voricona zole, caspofungin, liposomal amphotericin B 
(Ambisome), posaconazole or amphotericin B lipid  complex (Abelcet) are valid alternatives.  
During prophylaxis with any of the above ag ents, fluconazole should be discontinued.  In 
patients with therapeutic cyclosporine levels at the initiation of voriconazole therapy, the cyclosporine or tacrolimus dose should be decreas ed by [CONTACT_3450] 50 %. In patients with 
therapeutic sirolimus levels at the initiation of voriconazole therapy, the sirolimus dose 
should be decreased by [CONTACT_3450] 90%.
6) Determination of GVHD treatment response should be made  within 96 hours of starting the 
treatment.  The following are criteria to determine definitions of response to GVHD 
treatment:
a) Complete response:  Complete  resolution of all clinical signs and symptoms of acute 
GVHD.
b) Partial Response: 50% reduction in skin rash, stool volum e or frequency, and/or total 
bilirubin.  Maintenance of adequate performance status (Karnofsky Score > 70%).
c) Non-responder: < 50% reduction in skin rash , stool volume or frequency, and/or total 
bilirubin.  Failure to maintain adequate performance status (Karnofsky Score d70%).
d) Progressive disease:  Further progression of  signs and symptoms of acute GVHD, and/or 
decline in performance status after the initiation of therapy.

9.5 A PPENDIX E: M ANAGEMENT OF ENGRAFTMENT SYNDROME
Clinical Definition of Engraftment Syndrome
A constellation of clinical symptoms and signs has been observed during neutrophil recovery 
following HSCT, most commonly termed “engra ftment syndrome” (ES) , but interchangeably 
termed “capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737]” and “autoa ggression syndrome”.  Engraftment syndromes 
have been observed after both autologous and allogeneic HSCT; in the latter setting, the clinical 
sequelae of neutrophil recovery were historically attributed to an early, sometimes “hyperacute” graft-versus-host reaction.  Our current understa nding of ES holds the overproduction of pro-
inflammatory cytokines at the time of neutrophil recovery to be the initiating event.  The study of 
ES has been somewhat hindered by [CONTACT_510288]; 
therefore, the following criteria have been propose (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626] 2001):
Major criteria: xFever > 38.3 qwith no identifiable infectious etiology
xErythrodermatous rash involving more than 25% of body 
surface area and not attributable to a medication
xNoncardiogenic pulmonary edem a, manifested by [CONTACT_510289] > 2 mg/dl or 
transaminases levels > two times normalxRenal insufficiency (serum creatinine > two times baseline)
xWeight gain > 2.5% of baseline body weight
xTransient encephalopathy unexp lainable by [CONTACT_22714]
A diagnosis of ES is established by [CONTACT_22715], or two major criteria 
and one or more minor criteria; the clinical si gns and symptoms should appear within 96 hours of 
neutrophil recovery, according to the above proposed definition.
Neutrophil recovery after transplantation ma y result in “engraftment syndrome” (which 
may include fever, rash, edema, hypoxia)
The following criteria will be utilized to diagnose engraftment syndrome (must have 3 major criteria or 2 major + 1 minor criteria):
To promote consistency of our clinical prac tice, the following will be the recommended 
therapy for engraftment syndrome.  However, th is schedule may be modified (taper either 
accelerated or delayed) for individual pa tients as clinical circumstances warrant.
Treatment of Engraftment Syndrome
The mainstay of therapy for ES is high-dose co rticosteroids, based upon the literature on diffuse 
alveolar hemorrhage in the setting of bone marro w transplantation – a co mplication that many 
investigators now believe to be part of the spectrum of ES (M etcalf et al. 1994).  Our group has 
adopted the following treatment sc hema for patients diagnosed with  ES, with satisfactory results:
Day 1: Methylprednisolone 250 mg IV Q6 hours x 4 doses
Day 2: Methylprednisolone 250 mg IV Q8 hours x 3 dosesDay 3: Methylprednisolone 250 mg IV Q12 hours x 2 dosesDay 4: Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV Q12 hours x 2 doses
Abbreviated Title: HSCT for GATA2 Mutation
Version Date: 05/18/2016
Day 5: Methylprednisolone 60 mg IV Q12 hours x 2 doses
Day 6: Methylprednisolone 30 mg IV Q12 hours x 2 dosesDays 7-8: Prednisone 60 mg PO QD x 2 daysDays 9-10: Prednisone 50 mg PO QD x 2 daysDays 11-12: Prednisone 40 mg PO QD x 2 daysDays 13-14: Prednisone 30 mg PO QD x 2 daysDays 15-16: Prednisone 20 mg PO QD x 2 daysDays 17-18: Prednisone 10 mg PO QD x 2 daysDay 19: Discontinue prednisone
In the event that symptoms or clinical signs of  ES recur during the ster oid taper, patients should 
be retreated with methylprednisolone at a minimum dose of 60 mg IV QD.  This schema is 
intended to serve as a guideline and to promote c onsistency in our clinic al practice; it may be 
modified for individual patients as clinical circumstances warrant. In particular, steroid dosing 
for pediatric patients (< 18) will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

PRECLINICAL SERVICE POLICY FOR SAMPLE HANDLING  
Storage/Tracking in the Preclinical Development and Clinical Monitoring Facility 
(PDCMF)
xNormal patient blood and tissue samples, coll ected for the purpose of research under IRB 
approved protocols of the Ex perimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB)
may be archived by [CONTACT_510290] (PDCMF). All data associated with archived clinical research samples is entered into the ETIB PDCMF’s Microsoft Excel databases on frozen cells and plasma. These databases 
are stored on the NCI group drive in the ETIB ‘PRECLINSERVICE’ folder. Access to this folder is limited to PDCMF staff and ETIB clinical staff, requiring individual login and password. All staff in the PDCMF laboratory receives annually updated NIH/CIT 
training and maintains standa rds of computer security.
xThe data recorded for each sample includes the patient ID, trial name/protocol number, 
date drawn, treatment cycle/pos t-transplant time point, cell source (e. g. peripheral blood, 
lymphapheresis, mobilized peripheral blood stem  cells, marrow, urine, skin or oral biopsy
as well as box and freezer location. Patient  demographics that correlate treatment 
outcomes and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_510229]/ETIB 
clinical records. As of January 2007, all newly received samples receive a unique bar 
code number, which is included in the sample record in the PDCMF database. Only this 
bar code is recorded on the sample vial and th e vials will not be traceable back to patients 
without authorized access to the PDCMF data base. All non-coded samples previously 
archived will be stripped of identifiers prior to distribution for any use other than as a primary objective of the protocol under which they were collected.
xSamples are stored in locked freezers. All samples will be labeled solely with a bar code 
(which includes the date, and serially deter mined individual sample identifier). The key 
will be available to a restricted number of ETIB investigators and associate investigators 
on the protocol. Coded samples will be stored frozen at -20°, -80° or liquid nitrogen vapor phase to -180 C according to the stab ility requirements in a single location under 
the restricted control of the PDCMF of ETIB.
xAccess to samples from a protocol for research purposes will be by [CONTACT_83939] [INVESTIGATOR_510230] (1) for research purposes 
associated with protocol objectives for which the samples were collected, or (2) for a new 
research activity following submission and I RB approval of a new pr otocol and consent, 
or (3) for use only as unlinked or coded samples under the OHSRP Exemption Form 
guidelines stipulating that the activity is exempt from IRB review. Unused samples must be returned to the PDCMF laboratory.
xSamples and associated data will be stored permanently unless the patient withdraws 
consent. If researchers have samples remaining once they have completed all studies 
associated with the protocol, they must  be returned to the PDCMF laboratory.
xThese freezers are located onsite at the Pr eclinical Service laboratory (12C216) (-85° 
freezer) or in ETIB common equipment space (CRC/3-3273).

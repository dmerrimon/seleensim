You are  being asked  to take  part in this research study  because  you suffered a  critical  illness and were  in an 
intensive  care  unit (ICU).   Research studies are  voluntary and include  only people  who choose  to take  part.   
Please  read this consent  form  carefully and  take  your time making your decision.   As your study doctor or study 
staff discusses this  consent  form  with you, please  ask him/her to  explain any words or information  that you do not  
clearly understand.  We  encourage  you to  talk with your family and  friends  before  you decide  to take  part in this 
research study.  The  nature  of the  study,  risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and  other important  information 
about  the study are  listed below.  Please  tell the  study doctor or study staff   if you are  taking part  in another  
research study.
A grant  from  the National  Center for Complimentary and Integrative  Health  (NCCIH) will  sponsor this study.  
Portions of  [CONTACT_156825]’s and his  research team’s  salaries  will be paid by [CONTACT_68793].  We will recruit  
participants from  Duke  University Medical  Center (DUMC) over approximately twelve  months from  the time of 
study initiation.  
Who will  be my doctor  on this study?
If you decide  to participate, [CONTACT_156826] will  be your doctor for  the study and will  be in contact  [CONTACT_156810],  if needed.
Why is  this study being  done?
The purpose  of this study is  to find better  ways to  help people  who have  been  patients  in an ICU deal  with stress 
and both physical  and emotional  difficulties  that occur  following  discharge  from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
How many people  will take  part in  this study?
Approximately 200 people  will take  part in this study at  different  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156808].  We will  recruit  
approximately 90 participants from  Duke  University Medical  Center (DUMC) over approximately twelve  months 
from  the time  of study  initiation.  
What is  involved in  this study?
If you agree  to be in this study, you will  be asked to  sign and date  this consent  form.   You will  be randomly 
assigned (like  drawing straws) to  one of three  groups.  Of the  90 people  enrolled, 35 people  will be in Group 1, 35 
people  in group 2, and 20 people  in Group  3. You will  be told to  which  group you are  assigned.   If you are  in 
Group 1, you will receive  the mindfulness-based training telephone  program. This program  is a series of 4 short  
(30 minutes)  telephone  calls  that will be scheduled weekly according to  your  convenience.  During these  calls, a  
trained professional  will provide  training in  mindfulness techniques for stress and  symptom  management  such as  
relaxation, activity pacing, and communication.  If you are  in Group 2, you will  receive  the mobile  mindfulness 
training program  (mMBT), which is  delivered via  a website  designed  for mobile  devices. This program  will be 
self-directed via  a website  accessible  from  a computer,  tablet, or phone. This program  will provide  training  in 
mindfulness techniques for  stress  and symptom  management  such as  relaxation, activity  pacing, and 
communication. You will  also receive  brief weekly surveys to  fill out within the  website  so that  we can measure  
your progress. You will  be contact[CONTACT_156811]. If you are  in Group  3, you will  
participate  in a critical  illness education program.  You will  receive  educational  handouts and  access to  videos that  
provide  information about  acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  You will  also receive  2 brief, check-in calls  from  a member  
of our study  team to  provide  additional  support  and answer any questions.
Those  in all groups will  participate  in three  telephone  interviews and  one in-person interview identical  in content  
and timing.   In these  interviews you will  complete  questionnaires asking about  your  mood, anxiety  level, and your

What are  the risks  of this study?
There  are no known physical  risks  associated with this study.  There  is, however, the  potential  risk of loss  of 
confidentiality.  Every effort  will be made  to keep your  information  confidential, however, this cannot  be 
guaranteed.  Some  of the  questions we  will ask you as  part of this study may  make  you feel  uncomfortable  or 
cause  emotional  distress.  You may  refuse  to answer any of the  questions and you may  take  a break  at any time 
during the  study.  You may  stop your  participation  in this study at  any time.
Because  e-mail  and text  messages  do not  provide  a completely secure  and confidential  means  of communication, 
please  do not  use email or text  messages if  you wish to  keep your communication private.   Instead,  please  let us 
know and we  will communicate  with you only through regular channels like  the telephone.
The website  used in  this study is  developed  by [CONTACT_156815].   As with any  
website  that you visit  or software  that you download,  there  may  be potential  security  risks and Duke  cannot  
guarantee  that the website/software  is free of risk.  In general, it is  recommended that  you run  a current  operating 
system  (OS) on your computer, review the  privacy/security settings on your web  browsers, run antivirus software, 
make  sure  that your connection is  encrypted (look for the  lock icon  when you connect), and  log off of websites  
when you are  done.  When viewing the  website  on a  mobile  device  or tablet,  it is recommended that  you run  a 
current  operating system  (OS) on your  device,  review  the privacy/security settings often, and  restrict  any 
unnecessary access.  If  you do not  have  an unlimited  data/text  plan, you may  incur additional  charges.
We are  not asking you to  make  any health decisions based on the  use of this website.   You should discuss  health 
decisions directly with your healthcare  provider.
As with all  technology, we  ask you to  wait  until  you are  in a safe environment, use  good judgment  and follow 
prevailing laws. Do not  perform  study-related activities  while  you are  driving.
Are there  benefits  to taking  part in  this study?
If you agree  to take  part in this study, there  may  be no direct  medical  benefit  to you.  Your responses to  the 
surveys and interviews will  not affect  the clinical  care  you receive.  If you are  in any Group, we  anticipate  that the 
study  may  reduce  distress and improve  your satisfaction with your ICU care, the  communication  you have  with 
doctors, and possibly the  process  of recovery after  critical  illness—though this  is not certain.  We hope  the 
information learned  from  this study  will benefit  other  persons who receive  care  in an ICU in  the future.   
Are there  alternatives to  taking  part in  this study?
You are  free to choose  not to participate  in this study.   You will  continue  to receive  regular clinical  care  
regardless of  whether  or not  you choose  to participate.
Will my information be  kept  confidential?
Study records that  identify  you will  be kept  confidential  as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Federal  Privacy Regulations provide  
safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access. Except  when required by [CONTACT_156816], you will  
not be identified by [CONTACT_2300],  social  security number, address,  telephone  number,  or any other  direct  personal  
identifier in  study records disclosed outside  of Duke  University Health  System  (DUHS).  For records disclosed 
outside  of DUHS, you will  be assigned a  unique  code  number. The  key to  the code  will be kept  securely at 
DUHS.
Your records  may  be reviewed  in order  to meet federal  or state  regulations.  Reviewers may  include  
representatives of  the DUHS Institutional  Review Board.  If this group reviews your research  record, they  may

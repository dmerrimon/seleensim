The CHICAGO Plan was a randomized 3 -arm parallel group, multi -center pragmatic trial in six 17 
Emergency Departments (EDs ) affiliated with public or private hospi[INVESTIGATOR_751930] a high 18 
proportion of black or Latino children in Chicago to compare: 1) an ED -only intervention 2) an 19 
ED-plus-home intervention; and 3) Enhanced usual care.  Eligibility criteria were intended to be [ADDRESS_1029456] in multiple EDs serving underserved communities 21 
in Chicago (six Clinical Centers serving different populations of children 5 -11 years presenting 22 
with asthma).  Data collection employed validated approaches, but were also intended to minimize [ADDRESS_1029457] a 3 -arm multi -center  pragmatic trial comparing the effectiveness of  the ED-only,  ED- 29 
plus-home,  and usual care strategies.   30

V.  Interventions and comparators  121 
 122 
All children who participated in the CHICAGO Plan received  asthma care per their ED clinicians.  123 
In addition, the CHICAGO Plan’s ED Coordinator provided all participants two metered dose 124 
inhaler (MDI) spacers free -of-charge and used  teach -to-goal methodology  (repeated rounds of 125 
education and evaluation until the child achieves mastery) to educate the ch ild and the caregiver 126 
about appropriate MDI inhaler technique . Patient  education regarding the MDI device was selected 127 
because it is commonly used for quick -relief medications and is also the device for many inhaled 128 
controller medications. Children were th en randomly assigned to either of two active comparators 129 
or enhanced usual care.  130 
 131 
1. ED-only.  Based on feedback from our stakeholders, we developed the CHICAGO Action 132 
Plan after Emergency department discharge tool (CAPE; APPENDIX A1 ); a culturally 133 
tailored and literacy -appropriate communication tool for use on ED discharge .  Based on 134 
the ED treating clinician’s discharge instructions, a  CHICAGO Plan ED Coordinator 135 
utilized the CAPE to support guideline recommended asthma care on ED discharge (a 136 
course of sys temic corticosteroids; daily inhaled corticosteroids or other controller; as 137 
needed quick -relief inhaled medication; education about the medications and appropriate 138 
inhaler technique; education about asthma trigger avoidance; and a post -discharge follow - 139 
up appointment) and to support appropriate asthma self -management in the home. The 140 
CAPE tool uses simplified language, visual learning, and options for individualization to 141 
facilitate communication about discharge instructions between clinicians and the chil d and 142 
caregiver.  143 
 144 
2. ED-plus-home .  Participants randomly allocated to the ED -plus-home intervention received  145 
the same ED-only intervention described above but were also offered up to five home visits 146 
over 6 months  conducted by a CHW visits to: 1) assist in the implementation of the ED 147 
discharge  instructions, 2) update the asthma treatment plan with input from  the patient’s 148 
ambulatory clinician  utilizing the CAPE tool called the Asthma Home Plan ( APPENDIX 149 
A2), 3) develop a plan to manage  asthma during school hours (e.g., access to quick -relief 150 
medications, action plan in case of respi[INVESTIGATOR_60319]), and 4) develop  a specific and 151 
feasible plan to reduce environmental triggers at home  (e.g., environmental tobacco smoke, 152 
roach, mice) .  Home v isits were scheduled for [ADDRESS_1029467] # AS 1307 -[ZIP_CODE]

months (180 days) after ED discharge .  155 
  156 
3. Enhanced usual care .    Based on stakeholder feedback, we modified usual care so that 157 
children in the “usual care” group also received teaching about appropriate MDI technique 158 
using teach -to-goal methodology  and two MDI spacers free -of-charge,  as well as doorknob 159 
hangers depi[INVESTIGATOR_542311] g facts about asthma unrelated to the study interventions . We therefore 160 
refer to this group as “Enhanced usual care.”   To describe usual  care at each site, the site [ADDRESS_1029468] manager conducted  chart abstractions (masked to treatment assignment ).  Site [ADDRESS_1029469] # AS 1307 -[ZIP_CODE]

 167 
Randomization occurred  at the patient  level , with permuted block sizes stratified by [CONTACT_751939] 168 
(black vs. non -black). Based on data from the Clinical Centers, we expect ed about 70 % of enrolled 169 
participants to be black, 23 % to be white, and that the remainder would be mostly Asian.  Of the 170 
planned enrollment of 640 children, we expected 15% to be Hispanic/Latino .  Stratification  by [CONTACT_545] 171 
for the purposes of randomization was “Black” (those who selected Black  or African American, [ADDRESS_1029470] one race was Black or African American) vs. “non -Black” (American 173 
Indian/Alaskan Native, A sian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, white, and multi -race if 174 
none are Black or  African American ).   175

VIII. Outcomes  221 
 222 
The selection of primary outcomes was based on several criteria: 1)  patient -centeredness, defined 223 
as domains identif ied as  important by  [CONTACT_751940] s; as described in our previous 224 
publications;  2) availability of validated measures in English and in Spanish that could be 225 
administered in person and by [CONTACT_648]; 3) plausibility that such measures could be responsi ve to an 226 
effective int ervention in the target population; and 4 ) limited burden (e.g., time) for study 227 
participants.   On this basis, we selected two NIH Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement 228 
Information System (PROMIS) measures  as primary outcomes (1 for the child and 1 for the 229 
caregiver).   Several measures were selected for secondary outcomes  to address recommendations  of [ADDRESS_1029483] using the 236 
PROMIS Parent Proxy Short Form v1.0 – Asthma Impact 8a.  In children 8 to 11 years , we used 237 
the PROMIS Pediatric Short Form v1.0 – Asthma Impact 8a.  238 
 239 
2. The change in Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles  at 6 months compared to the 240 
baseline assessed in the ED served as the primary outcome in the caregiver .  We used the PROMIS 241 
Short Form v1.0 – Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles 4a.  242 
 243 
B.  Secondary outcomes  244 
For children :   245 
1) The Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT ) at 6 months compared to the baseline assessed 246 
in the ED  247 
2) Acute care visits at 6 months (number of all -cause urgent care  visits, ED visits, 248 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], using electronic health records )   249 
 250 
For caregivers :  251 
1) Pediatric Asthma Caregiver ’s Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ ) at 6 months 252 
compared to the baseline assessed in the ED  253 
2) NIH PROMIS measures for anxiety, depression , fatigue , sleep disturbance at [ADDRESS_1029484] # AS 1307 -[ZIP_CODE]

12-01-2017          Page 11 of 36 Indicators of guideline -consistent asthma care provided on ED discharge :  258 
1) Systemic corticosteroids prescribed for use at home (yes/no)  259 
2) Inhaled corticosteroids or another controller medication presc ribed for use at home (yes/no)  260 
3) Quick -relief medications prescribed for use at home (yes/no)  261 
4) Follow -up appointment scheduled (yes/no)  262 
Child’s/caregiver’s s elf-management practices after ED discharge : 263 
1) Filled  prescriptions for systemic corticosteroids within 7 days of ED discharge ( yes/no ) 264 
2) Filled  prescription for inhaled corticosteroids or other asthma controller  within 7 days of 265 
ED discharge (yes/no)  266 
3)   Attend ance at outpatient appointment with  patient -identified asthma provider within 4 267 
weeks of ED discharge (yes/no)  [ADDRESS_1029485].  278 
The W sta tistic, p -value and mean rank were reported together with horizontal mirror bar plots. For 279 
primary outcomes, a statistical significance occurred when p -value was less than 0.0167 after 280 
Bonferroni correction for three pairwise comparisons (0.05/3). In addit ion, chi -square tests were 281 
also conducted for other secondary outcomes.  282 
 283 
To address missing data in the analyses, we checked the missing completely at random (MCAR) 284 
assumption and then employed a multiple imputation strategy. Using a logistic regression method 285 
described in Hedeker & Gibbons (2006), we found that the current outcome missingness was not [ADDRESS_1029486] for continuous 289 
variables. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups (i.e. with and without 290 
missing  primary outcomes). We therefore used a fully conditional specification (FCS) approach to [ADDRESS_1029487] in the primary analysis models for 30 292 
imputations.  The raw and imputed data had similar distributions (mean, standard deviation, 293 
minimu m and maximum values).  294 
 295 
Since the two primary outcomes were not normally distributed and our data satisfied the MCAR 296 
assumption, we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the effect of intervention 297 
group on outcomes at 3 and at 6 months com pared to that of the enhanced usual care group using 298 
ordinal logistic regression models; the continuous dependent variables were categorized into 299 
quartiles. The main predictors of the unadjusted GEE models were time (0, 1, 3, and 6 months), 300 
intervention gr oup, and their interactions. In an adjusted model, we added pre -specified covariates 301 
including, race (Black vs. non -Black), ethnicity ( Latino  vs. non -Latino ), gender (boy vs. girl), [ADDRESS_1029488] # AS 1307 -[ZIP_CODE]  
 
CHICAGO Plan Protocol  
12-01-2017          Page 12 of 36 health insurance (Public aid vs. Other), site enrolled (sites 1 to 6), number of all -cause acute care 303 
use in the 12 months prior to enrollment (at least one vs. none). To access the intervention effect 304 
between groups across time, we reported our results as odds ratios (ORs for higher quartiles) of 305 
interactions between study g roup and time and their 98% confident intervals [CIs; corresponding 306 
to a 2 -sided alpha=0.0167) to account for Bonferroni adjustments for the three pairwise [ADDRESS_1029489] 310 
interaction between intervention, time, and a subgroup factor in the model described previously. 311 
Pre-specified subgroup factors included race (Black vs. non -black), ethnicity ( Latino  vs. non - 312 
Latino ), gender (boy vs. girl), and number of all -cause ac ute care use in the 12 months prior to 313 
enrollment (at least one vs. none).  314 
 315 
Power / sample size  calculation. The power analyses did not incorporate adjustment for the 316 
presence of two primary outcomes.  Such an adjustment is not commonly made in biomedical 317 
trials, as multivariate (viz. MANOVA) analyses are not commonly conducted. The power analysis 318 
for single outcomes employed the Rochon (1991) method based on Hotelling's T -squared, which [ADDRESS_1029490] a conservative (larger) sample size.   We proposed to 321 
enroll and randomize 640 participants over 18 months (~200 -215 for each of the 3 treatment 322 
groups).   Assuming evaluable data in 80% of enrolled  participants (n=512) at 6 months (the time - 323 
point for the analyses of the primary outcomes), sample size calculations suggest ample power.  324 
Our approach was based on the methods of Rochon, with a Bonferroni adjustment for 3 pair -wise 325 
comparisons (2 -sided α  =0.05/3 =0.0167; enhanced usual care and two active intervention groups), 326 
power 80%, 4 measurements per individual (0, 1, 3, and 6 months), within individual correlation 327 
0.80, correction for within ED clustering (design effect of 2), and a coefficient of determination 328 
(R2) for control of individual -level demographics = 0.15.  Based on these considerations, a sample 329 
size of 426 (well within the expected sample size of 512) was estimated to be sufficient for a [ADDRESS_1029491] d eviations (SDs) (midway between Cohen’s 331 
“small” (0.2 SDs) and “medium” (0.5 SDs) effect sizes) for each of the two primary continuous [ADDRESS_1029492] between estimates of the minimum important difference (MID) for 335 
PROMIS T -scores (2 to 5).  [ADDRESS_1029493] # AS 1307 -[ZIP_CODE]

12-01-2017          Page 13 of 36 X.  Barriers  and facilitators of successfully implementing the intervention  (Secondary aim ) 339 
 340 
Health system interventions are often multi -component, and when they successfully improve care or 341 
outcomes, it is helpful to know whether all components of the intervention we re necessary for 342 
success.  Also, when care outcomes are not improved, it is unclear if barriers to implementation 343 
(fidelity) or lack of efficacy  contributed to a lack of effect.  We therefore  a mixed  -methods 344 
approach to   1) assess  the fidelity  of implementing the ED-only and ED -plus-home interventions; 345 
and 2) conduct interviews to debrief with study staff and a convenience sample of caregivers.    346 
 347 
(1) Intervention fidelity: We assessed our key perfor mance indicators (see APPENDIX B) as 348 
complet ed or not completed  to measure the extent to which each patient received each component 349 
of the CHICAGO Plan intervention , based on their allocation to the three treatment groups .   350 
 351 
(2) Focus groups:  We complete d debrief interviews with caregivers  to better understand  if they 352 
were satisfied with the content, comprehension, and relevance of the intervention material.  We 353 
also asked  about the satisfaction with the interventions provided by [CONTACT_751941], 354 
and any other comments the patient o r caregiver would like to offer about how to improve the 355 
CHICAGO Plan. We inform ed the participants that their responses would  be used to help 356 
determine how to improve studies in the future  (UIC IRB # 2017 -0888) . 357 
 358

Human subjects involvement and characteristics  381 
The trial aimed to  include approximately 640 children ages 5 -11 years  and their caregivers.  The 382 
eligibility criteria are discussed in an earli er section of this protocol.  Children and caregivers were  383 
randomly allocated to 1) ED-only; 2) ED-plus-home ; or 3) Enhanced usual care .  All participants [ADDRESS_1029498] 6  months , regardless  of the group they are 385 
assigned to; a study coordinator (masked to the treatment assignment) conduct ed assessment visits [ADDRESS_1029499] index ED visit.   387

B. Sources of materials  389 
 390 
Sources of materials included: Questionnaires administered by [CONTACT_751943] (baseline data), 391 
and those administered by [CONTACT_751944] (follow -up data); Pharmacy dispensation 392 
data and electronic health records (EHR) ; Direct observation (e.g ., home inspection / completion [ADDRESS_1029500]; review of inhaler technique using checklist) . [ADDRESS_1029501] only to minimal risks through this research ; we were  398 
testing two different approaches to promoting guideline recommended care ( ED-only;  ED-plus- 399 
home ) compared to usual Enhanced usual  care.  Potential  risks include d inconvenience or 400 
embarrassment involved in completing questionnaires or demonstrating self -management skills, or 401 
permitting the CHW (or research assistant) to conduct home visits for interventions (or for 402 
assessments), or in allowing the DCC to obtain pharmacy dispensation records (used for measuring 403 
adherence).  The caregiver was not required to answer any questions (or conduct any part of the 404 
study) that he/she  was reluctant to discuss/conduct. There  was also a risk of loss of confidentiality.  405 
The CHW was instructed to avoid providing  patients/caregivers with any type of medical advice, [ADDRESS_1029502] access to health care providers to address any patient/caregiver clinical questions or [ADDRESS_1029503] 408

 416 
Recruitment and informed consent /assent  417 
We sought  informed assent in all children that were  capable of providing assent (age ≥7 years old) 418 
and permission of their caregiver in the ED . In children < 7 years old, consent was obtained from 419 
the caregiver in the ED . As this study was no greater than minimal ri sk, the permission of only one 420 
parent or guardian was sufficient for research to be conducted under the Additional Protections for 421 
Children Involved as Subjects in Research (45 CFR Part 46.404). Assent from the child and [ADDRESS_1029505] # AS 1307 -[ZIP_CODE]

participating clinical site. All staff were  trained in informed consent/assent procedures and were  424 
available to read the consent/assent forms to individual with low literacy levels. The consent/asse nt 425 
form s were  available in English and Spanish.  426 
 427 
All caregiver/family information, including contact [CONTACT_3031], qu estionnaires, pharmacy [ADDRESS_1029506] -protected files.  Only authorized study staff had access to study data.  Study reports 431

as it relates to answering questions for the patient -reported outcomes (the primary outcomes and 438 
several secondary outcomes) . Although there may have been  changes in behavior (e.g., i mproved 439 
adherence to corticosteroids), our studies and those of others have shown that monitoring does not 440 
itself result in sustained adherence. To minimize this risk , however , there was incomplete 441 
disclosure of the interventions in the CHICAGO study durin g informed consent. The study was 442 
described as testing different communication strategies combining written and verbal instructions 443 
to all participants.  Using doorknob hangers, as was successfully performed in a recent study , we 444 
aimed to mask the participants .  Regardless of the arm the participant is randomized in, children 445 
and caregiver/families will receive a doorknob hanger in the form of a plasticized document, 446

 450 
Incomplete disclosure is generally necessary in studies of bias or social desirabili ty (such as 451 
monitoring of adherence) and is considered acceptable by [CONTACT_751946], the American [ADDRESS_1029509]. Krishnan, we had been guided by [CONTACT_317921] 454

 462 
It is difficult to know if the participants benefit ed from the research.  All study 463 
participants/caregivers receive d instruction about appropriate MDI use with the teach -to-back 464 
methodology; they also receive d two MDI spacers for their use.   Other than these specific  benefits, [ADDRESS_1029511] # AS 1307 -[ZIP_CODE]

12-01-2017          Page 36 of 36 The study design employed  the “larg e simple trial” or “pragmatic trial” format, rather than an 890 
efficacy design.  The target performance varied  by [CONTACT_375678].  For elements linked to human subjects 891 
protection (e.g., obtaining written informed consent from the caregiver; assent from the child >7y rs), 892 
the definition for major protocol deviation is <100%.  For elements linked to implementing the 893 
interventions or data collection linked to specific time points, the definition for major protocol 894 
deviation is <50%.   The goal is 100% performance on all metrics; we will ask site PIs to develop a 895 
written corrective action plan if site -level performance for implementing the protocol is <80% 896 
(<100% if there are deviations linked to human subjects protection).  We reported  major protocol [ADDRESS_1029556] PI.  898 
Depending on the site -specific reporting requirements, we may also report major deviations to the 899 
site’s Institutional Review Board (IRB); for example, we will report all instances wh ere informed 900 
consent was not obtained, but, depending on the institution may not need to report completion rates 901 
of study visits prior to the annual continuing review date for that institution’s IRB . 902

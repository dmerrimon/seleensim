Title of Study: Dasotraline (2mg) in Children Aged 6 to 12 Years with Attention- Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD): A Randomized, Multicenter, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group 
Study of Efficacy and Safety in a Laboratory Classroom Setting  
Proposed Indication: Attention -Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  
Study Centers:  Approximately 5 centers in North America  
Planned Study Period:  4-6 months  
Study Objectives : 
Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of dasotraline 2 mg/day compared to placebo on attention- deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children (6 – 12 years of age) , who weigh ≤ 30 kg,  in a 
laboratory classroom setting.  
Secondary: 
•To evaluate the efficacy of dasotraline 2 mg/day compared to placebo on ADHD symptoms
throughout the day ([ADDRESS_29106]- dose) in children in a laboratory classroom setting.
•To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasotraline 2 mg/day using physical examinations,
12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), vital signs, adverse event (AE) reports, clinical laboratory
results, and the Columbia – Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) Children’s Assessment.
Study Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and 
safety study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. The study will be comprised of 
3 periods: Screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to Day  -1, 
if necessary ; Double- blind randomized treatment  with either dasotraline ( 2 mg /day) or placebo for 
14 days; and a final safety evaluation [ADDRESS_29107] dose.  Prior to the start of treatment ( Day 1) and 
follo wing the conclusion of the double-blind period ( Day 15), subjects will undergo a full- day 
laboratory classroom evaluation in  cohorts of up to 18 subjects . Each laboratory classroom day will 
include seven 30- minute simulated classroom sessions where trained  observers will assess subjects 
using the Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during each 
classroom session, a [ADDRESS_29108] (Permanent Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) will 
be administered to evaluate sustai ned attention and effort. Seven (±  2) days after the last dose of study 
drug, subjects will return to the clinic and complete safety assessments.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline to Day  15 in ADHD symptoms as 
measured by [CONTACT_941] m ean SKAMP -Combined score obtained from an average of the 7 SKAMP 
assessments collected across the 12 -hour classroom day . The SKAMP is a validated 13 -item rating 
scale that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a classroom setting through a combined score and 2 subscale scores; deportment items (interacting with other children, interacting with adults, remaining 
quiet, staying seated, complying with the teacher’s directions, and following the classroom rules) and attention items (getting started, sticking with tasks, attending to an activity, making activity transitions, 
completing assigned tasks, performing work accurately, and being neat and careful while writing or 
drawing). The PERMP is a [ADDRESS_29109] consisting of 80 problems per page (total of 
400 prob lems); both attempted problems and correct problems will be assessed. Subjects are to 
complete as many problems as possible in [ADDRESS_29110] administered at screening. 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Proprietary 5  19 November 2017 Safety  and tolerability  will be  monitored  throu ghout the study by [CONTACT_29933],  12-lead ECG,  vital signs,  AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology,  chem istry, 
and urinalysi s), and the C-SSRS. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and 
tolerability data including data on AEs and serious AEs at regular intervals.  
Screening: The screening period will be completed within a maximum of [ADDRESS_29111]’s parents/legal guardians.  
Subjects will be confirmed as meeting DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Subjects may be 
either currently untreated or recei ving stimulan t ADHD medication at Screening.  On Day  -7 the 
ADHD Rating Scale Version  IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) 
(ADHD -RS-IV HV)  will be completed and subjects will attend a half -day practice laboratory classroom 
session intended to familiarize them with classroom schedules and procedures related to SKAMP evaluations, PERMP tests, and other planned activities. Any subjects receiving stimulant medication for 
ADHD will discontinue that ADHD treatment for [ADDRESS_29112]’s parent/legal guardian will be contact[CONTACT_29934] . Clinical ly significant is defined as an ADHD -RS-IV HV total score ≥  26 following a 
minimum 72-hour washout from any prior ADHD treatment.  Subjects who do not demonstrate 
clinically significant symptoms  (i.e., ADHD- RS-IV ≥ 26) on Day -1 will be considered screen failures 
and will not be  eligible for  randomiz ation.  
Subjects may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times for out of range clinical laboratory results, 
insufficient medicati on washout periods, etc. 
Double -blind Period: On Day 1 subjects will return to the clinic in the morning, and those m eeting all 
inclusion and no exclusion  criteria  will be randomized  (1:1) to receive 2 mg/day dasotraline, or placebo, 
and will attend classroom sessions in which they will be evaluated for ADHD symptoms using the 
SKAMP assessment. During this baseline classroom assessment ( Day 1), subjects will be evaluated at 
regular intervals: approximately 8  AM, 10 AM , 12 PM , 2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM,  and 8  PM. Sub jects will 
begin taking study drug on th e evening  of Day 1 (with or without food) after the final, 8:[ADDRESS_29113] leaves, or at home. On the night ( Day 14) before the  
second classroom day, study drug must be taken at approximately [ADDRESS_29114]’s parent/legal guardian daily with a 
reminder to administer study drug . A dosing diary will be provided to the parent/legal guardian  to record the 
date and time of each administration of study drug. On Day  15 subjects will return to the clinic in the 
morning at 6:30 AM and classroom sessions will be started at approximately 8  AM, 10 AM, 12 PM , 
2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM,  and 8 PM  to coincide with 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 hour s following the 
Day 14 dose.  
End of Study: Seven (±2)  days after the last dose of study drug, all subjects will return to the clinic 
and complete assessments. A fter the EOS visit, all subjects will be referred for continuation of their 
care as determined by [CONTACT_093]. Additionally, for subjects who complete the study or discontinue for tolerability or lack of efficacy reasons, the sponsor will provide support for approved 
ADHD medication costs for up to [ADDRESS_29115]’s healthcare provider. 
A study schematic is presented in Figure  1. A summary  of assessments to be conducted at each 
visit is  presented in Table 2, Schedule of Assessments.

Statistical Methods:  
Hypotheses:  
Let μ 2mg/day, and μ PBO represent the changes from baseline at Day 15 in mean SKAMP-Combined score 
for dasotraline 2 mg /day,  and placebo arms, respectively. The following hypothesi s wil l be tested to 
compare the mean change value between the dasotraline 2 mg /day group and the placebo group from 
baseline to Day  15: 
1. Dasotraline 2 mg /day versus placebo:  
 H 01: μ2mg/day = μ PBO versus H 11: μ2mg/day ≠ μ PBO  
Efficacy Analysis: 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be applied to evaluate the treatment effect for the primary 
efficacy endpoint between the dasotraline 2  mg/day and placebo groups for the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population. The model will include treatment, mean SKAMP -Combined score at baseline, and site as 
fixed effects. T he primary efficacy analysis will be repeated for the per protocol (PP) population. To 
explore the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis of change from baseline at Day 15 in ADHD 
symptoms in mean SKAMP-Combine d score, 2  sensitivity analyses will be performed, a placebo -based 
multiple imputation pattern -mixture model (PMM) and a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_29901]. 
A similar ANCOVA model, as described above, will be used for the secondary efficacy endpoints for  
the ITT population. 
Multiplicity Considerations: There will be no adjustment for multiplicity for the primary efficacy 
analysis, secondary efficacy analyses, or safety analyses.  
Safety Analysis:  
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. Overall  AEs (or SAEs)  and AEs (or 
SAEs)  leading to discontinuat ion w ill be  summar ized by [CONTACT_29936]. Descriptive  statistics  also will be 
provided by [CONTACT_29937]:

[CONTACT_941] C-SS RS, will be summarized  by [CONTACT_765].  
Sample Size:   
A post- hoc ANCOVA-L OCF analysis of data from the SEP360-[ADDRESS_29135] of dasotraline 4  mg/day versus placebo in a subset of pediatric patients  
with ADHD aged [ADDRESS_29136] size in this subgr oup of 0.95 (LS mean 
difference at Week  [ADDRESS_29137] error of 2.2). A ssum ing a smaller effect size for 
dasotraline 2  mg/day vs. placebo than that of dasotraline 4 mg/day vs. placebo, an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_29138] size of 0.7 for  dasotraline 2  mg/day compar ed to placebo on the primary 
efficacy endpoint of mean SKAMP -Combined score obtained from the average of 7  assessments 
collected across the 12 -hour classroom day, 88 subjects (44 per treatment group) will provide 90% 
power to detect a treatment effect between dasotraline and placebo at the two -sided alpha level of 0.05, 
based on the two- sample t -test with equal variance procedure. 
The study will target approximately [ADDRESS_29139] s (50 per treatment group) randomized to either placebo 
or dasotraline 2 mg/day in an attempt to have 88 subjects complete the trial (assuming a 12% overall 
dropout rate).

4.1. Backgrou nd 
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized 
by [CONTACT_29939], hyperactivity, and impulsivity that is more severe or frequent when compared to individuals of the same developmental stage. There are a number of characteristics 
related to cognition that distinguish people with ADHD from people without ADHD including 
deficits in response inhibition ( Aron -2005, Goto -2010, Luna -2004) and reward sensitivity 
(Passarotti -2011), as well as working memory,  attention, planning, and behavioral inhibition 
(Hervey -2004, Boonstra-2005, Willcutt-2005). ADHD is prevalent in approximately 8% to  10% 
of school-aged children and approximately 2% to 5% of adults ( Ferri -2014 ). Symptoms 
experienced in childhood often persist into adolescence and adulthood, al though the 
hyperactivity component tends to diminish over time (Ferri-2014). 
The etiology of ADHD is not fully understood, but it is believed that both genetic and non-
genetic factors are implicated in the disease. Several factors related to disturbances of neonatal 
development including premature birth, low birth weight and perinatal complications have been 
shown to increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_29903] ( Perricone -2013, Botting -1997, 
Amor -2005).The neurotransmitters dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_29904] a critical 
role in the development of ADHD and thus receptors associated with these are key drug targets (Rader -2009 ).  
Current ADHD pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_29905]. In 
nonclinical microdialysis studies, ADHD drugs like amphetamine, methylphenidate, and atomoxetine increase dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] – either by [CONTACT_29940] – especially in the prefrontal cortex. At clinically -efficacious doses, 50% dopamine 
transporter (DAT) occupancies are reported with methylphenidate in adults with ADHD (Volkow-1998).  
Adrenergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex is thought to control attentional processes and thus 
contribute to working memory and executive functions ( Arnsten -2011, Gamo -2011). Consistent 
with this neuronal circuitry, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_29906] (NET) inhibition (eg, atomoxetine) alone 
is sufficient for clinical efficacy in ADHD. The stimulants amphetamine and methylphenida te 
both increase norepi[INVESTIGATOR_29907], and methylphenidate achieves 50% NET occupancy in human subjects at doses clinically efficacious in ADHD ( Hannestad -2010).  
Dasotraline (also known as SEP-225289) is a new chemical entity that is thought to produce its 
therapeutic effects in ADHD by [CONTACT_29941], as determined by 
[CONTACT_29942]. Pharmacologically, dasotraline is consistent w ith 
dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (D NRI) effects. Dasotraline is a diastereomer of 
the major metabolite of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline, but is not a metabolite of sertraline, nor is it converted to the desmethylated metabolite of sertraline in vivo. Unlike amphetamines, dasotraline does not increase the release of these monoamines into the 
extraneuronal space. Dasotr aline's pharmacokinetic profile  allows plasma concentrations to 
remain in a therapeutic range over the [ADDRESS_29158]  study to assess the efficacy and s afety of dasotraline in pediatric subjects  
with ADHD.  The prior 2 studies demonstrated efficacy at 4  mg in comparison to placebo. This 
study will utilize a simulated classroom setting , identical to the one used in SEP360-305, to 
evaluate the efficacy and s afety of dasotraline 2 mg/day  in pediatric subjects with ADHD. In this 
setting subjects encounter activities and interaction normally found in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_29908]. The 
laboratory school protocol ( Wigal -2006) is a particularly useful method for evaluation of 
efficacy in subjects with ADHD because it represents a controlled study setting for evaluation and comparison of study treatments. 
The present study seeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dasotraline 2  mg/day . Data 
supporting the safety and efficacy of both a [ADDRESS_29159] a range of 
potential doses (2-4 mg/day) for children, allowing clinicians the flexibility to achieve the 
optimal benefit/risk for each patient.  
Further information on nonclinical and other clinical studies is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
4.3. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
There are two recently completed studies in children  with ADHD that report on the efficacy and 
tolerability of dasotraline  (SEP360-202 and SEP360-305), both of which demonstrated 
statisticall y significant improvement compared t o placebo at the 4  mg/day dose. A third study, 
SEP360-310, has been completed but the analyses are not yet finalized. 
 
SEP360-202 
SEP360- 202 evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2  doses of dasotraline (2 mg/day and 4 mg/ day) 
in pediatric subjects with ADHD.  In this 6-week double-blind, placebo controlled trial, 
dasotraline (4  mg/day) was superior to placebo, and well tolerated. 
In SEP360-202, overall, 54.1% of subjects experienced at least 1  Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Event (TEAE) during the study, 38.6% experienced a TEAE that was considered by [CONTACT_7181], and 6.7% experienced a TEAE that led to 
discontinuation of study drug. Subjects in the dasotraline 4 mg/day group experienced more 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  25 19 November 2017 TEA Es, more related TEAEs, and more TEAEs that led to a discontinuation than the dasotraline 
2 mg/day group and the placebo group, and the placebo group experienced the least in each of 
these categories. No  subjects experienced an SAE and there were no deaths  during the study. 
 
SEP360-305 
SEP360- 305 evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline (4  mg/day) to placebo, in pediatrics 
with ADHD in a classroom laboratory setting over 2  weeks . The dasotraline (4  mg/day) dose 
demonstrated statistically superior efficacy when compared to placebo, and was well tolerated.  
In SEP360-305, TEAEs were more common in patients taking dasotraline compared with th ose 
taking placebo (data from the discontinued 6 mg arm of this trial are included here for safety 
consideration). TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity. Four patients receiving 
dasotraline experienced severe TEAEs: 4  mg/day: 1 case of insomnia and 1 case of decreased 
appetite;  6 mg/day: 2 cases of insomnia. No serious AEs occurred in patients treated with 
dasotraline. TEAEs associated with discontinuation were hallucinations (2 cases in the 6  mg/day 
group, 1 case in the 4  mg/day group), insomnia (1 case in the 4 mg/day group), decreased 
appetite (1 case in the 6  mg/day group), and rash (1 case in the 4 mg/ day group).  
 
Moreover, there have been three studies of dasotraline efficacy and tolerability in adults with 
ADHD including one long term de novo trial for safety ; SEP360-201, SEP360-301, and 
SEP360-[ADDRESS_29160] study  (SEP360-201),  a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, outpatient study at 
30 sites , evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in adults with ADHD using 2  doses 
(4 mg/day or 8  mg/day) versus placebo over a 4 -week treatment period. In this study, clinically 
meaningful treatment effects were observed for both dasotraline 4  mg/day and 8 mg /day 
compared to placebo. For the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale Version IV  (ADHD RS -IV) with adult prompts total score at week  4, statistical 
significance was achieved for dasotraline 8  mg/day compared to placebo (adjusted p = 0.019) 
with a strong trend for dasotraline 4 mg /day (adjusted p = 0.076). Efficacy with both doses was 
observed for the secondary endpoint Clinical Global Impression –Severity of Illness  (CGI -S; 
4 mg  group p = 0.021; 8 mg  group p = 0.013). A dose response relationship was observed 
supporting pharmacological activity in ADHD. Decreases in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol ( DHPG) 
concentrations indicated the presence of central NET inhibition. Adverse events (AEs) were 
consistent with dasotraline pharmacology, ie, insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, and 
headache. Worsening of insomnia associated with dasotraline was characterized by [CONTACT_2695], and 
shifts in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total score, particularly with dasotraline 8  mg/day. AEs, 
particularly insomnia, were the most frequent reason for discontinuation of dasotraline 8 mg /day. 
Decreases in mean body weight were generally greater for dasotraline 8  mg/day than 4 mg /day. 
Increases in mean supi[INVESTIGATOR_29909]-up were generally higher on dasotraline 8 mg /day than 4 mg /day

The second adult study (SEP360- 301) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline (4  mg/day 
and 6 mg/day) and although the doses were found safe, and the [ADDRESS_29161] study (SEP360-304) showed that dasotralin e, flexibly dosed from 4 mg/day to 
8 mg/day , appeared to be safe, well tolerated, and effective in adults for the long term treatment 
of ADHD. Given the long half-life of dasotraline, dosing increments at a frequency of no more than every [ADDRESS_29162] been assessed in several studies.  
One study was completed that evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and 
pharmacodynamic properties of dasotraline in ped iatric (6 – 12 years) and adolescent 
(13 - 17 years) subjects  with ADHD. In this multicenter, open-label study 105 subjects were 
assigned to single oral doses of dasotraline 1 - 16 mg in a dose- escalating manner. Dasotraline 
was characterized by [CONTACT_29943] (median t
max was 9.6 to 12 hour s) and elimination (median 
t½ was 56 to 84 hours) in both pediatric and adolescent subjects. The change in C max with dose 
was slightly greater than dose proportional. Increase in overall exposure (AUC) with dose was 
greater than dose proportional. Apparent oral clearance was highest in the lowest dose group 
relative to the higher dose groups. No deaths, serious adverse events (SAE), or discontinuations 
because of an adverse event (AE) were reported in this study. The mos t frequently reported AE 
by [CONTACT_29944] (25  subjects; 23.8%) and electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
(5 subjects; 4.8%), nearly all of which were considered related to study drug and mild in 
severity. Tachycardia AEs were reported in both age groups and in every dose cohort. Most 
events of tachycardia were reported on the day of study drug administration. No subjects 
experienced QT prolongations > 500 msec. Based on the centrally read electrocardiogram 
(ECGs ) in the study, no clinically signif icant trends were identified within the ECG results.  
Blood pressure increased, blood pressure systolic increased, blood pressure orthostatic abnormal, and orthostatic hypotension AEs were reported in [ADDRESS_29163] each. Overall, after dosing, 90 subjects (85.7%) met predefined criteria for orthostatic tachycardia and 40  (38.1%) met 
predefined criteria for orthostatic hypotension. 
Two studies have been  completed to support dasotraline as a compound with minimal abuse 
potential.  The first study  (SEP360-201), a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, outpatient 
study at 30 sites , evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in adults with ADHD using 
2 doses (4 mg /day or 8  mg/day) versus placebo over a 4- week treatment period.  No signs or 
symptoms of withdrawal upon discontinuation of dasotraline were observed for either dose. In 
addition, there was no evidence of drug liking or deterioration of psychiatric symptoms 
associated with either dose of dasotraline. No misuse or diversion of dasotraline was detected through the abuse potential monitoring plan. A second study evaluated dasotraline’s abuse 
liability and was conducted in recreational stimulant users; results indicated that dasotraline has 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  27 19 November 2017 low abuse liability  (Koblan-2016). All doses of dasotraline (8, 16, 36 mg ) demonstrated 
significantly lower drug liking scores than methylphenidate (40, 80 mg ) and were no greater than 
placebo.  
Four previous clinical studies in healthy adult subjects using single doses ranging from 0.2 mg  to 
36 mg  and doses of 1 mg /day to  3 mg /day for durations up of 21 days, and another study in adult 
subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) using doses of 0.5 mg /day and 2 mg /day for up 
to 8 weeks (56  days) also have been completed. In these clinical studies, dasotraline was 
generall y safe and well tolerated at the doses studied and there was no evidence of abuse or 
diversion and no symptoms of withdrawal. 
4.4. Hypothesis  
This study is designed to test the superiority of dasotraline 2 mg/day against placebo  based on 
Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Scale ( SKAMP )-Combined score in pediatric 
subjects  aged 6 -12 years  with ADHD who weigh ≤ 30 kg.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -group, efficacy and safety  study, 
in pediatric subjects  with ADHD in a laboratory classroom set ting. The study will target 
100 subjects ( 50 per treatment group ) to complete the study. The study will be comprised of 
3 periods: Period 1: screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout, 
if necessary,  prior to Day  -1; Period  2: double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline 
(2 mg /day) or placebo for 14 days; and Period 3: End of Study (EOS) visit ([ADDRESS_29166] 
dose). Prior to the start of treatment (Day 1) and following  the conclusion of the 14- day double-
blind per iod (Day 15), subjects will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation during 
which up to [ADDRESS_29167] (Permanent 
Product Measure of Performance [PERMP])  will be administered to evaluate sustained attention 
and effort . The appropriate math level  for each subject is determined based on results of the math  
pretest administered at screening.  
The p rimary efficacy endpoint will be baseline to endpoint change in the SKAMP -Combined 
score. 
Safety  and tolerability  will be  monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_29948] s, 12- lead ECG,  vital signs,  AEs, clinical  laboratories  (hematology, chem istry, and 
urinalysi s), and C- SSRS. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and 
clinical outcome data including data on AEs and serious AEs at re gular intervals.  
Screening: The screening period will be completed within a maximum of [ADDRESS_29168]’s parents/legal guardians.  
Subjects will be confirmed as meeting DSM -5 criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Subjects may 
be currently untreated for ADHD or receiving a  treatment regimen of stimulant medication for 
ADHD at Screening. On Day  -7 the ADHD Rating S cale Version  IV - Home Version (modified 
for investigator administration) ( ADHD -RS-IV HV) will be completed and subjects will attend a 
half-day practice laboratory classroom session intended to familiarize them with classroom schedules 
and procedures relat ed to SKAMP evaluations, PERMP tests, and other planned activities. Any 
subjects receiving stimulant medication for ADHD will discontinue that ADHD treatment for [ADDRESS_29169]’s parent/legal guardian will be contact[CONTACT_29949] . Clinically significant is defined a s an ADHD -RS-IV HV 
total score ≥  26. Subjects who do not demonstrate clinically significant symptoms on Day -1 will 
be considered screen failures and will not be eligible for randomization. 
Subjects may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times for out of range c linical laboratory results, 
insufficient medication washout periods, etc.

Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  33 19 November 2017 7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
After successfully meeting study entry criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1  ratio 
to 1 of the followi ng treatments:  
• 2 mg /day d asotraline (N  = 50 subjects)  
• Placebo (N  = 50 subjects)  
An Interactive Response System (IXRS) will be used to manage randomization on Day  1 and, if 
necessary, for emergency unblinding (see Section  7.2.3) of treatment assignment during the 
study. The IXRS is an integrated web based subject and drug management system. 
Study medication will be assigned by [CONTACT_29950]. The IXRS 
will generate instructions on which  medication  number to assign to a subject. 
7.2.2. Blinding  
This is a double-blind study. All study drug capsules (both dasotraline and placebo) are identical 
in color, shape, size, and packaging in order to maintain the blind. 
Subjects, Sponsor personnel, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical 
operations personnel, data analysts, and personnel at central laboratories will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock and unblinding, 
using the following methods; (1)  randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time 
of unblinding, and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_29951] s tudy with the exception 
of Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members involved in re gular review of safety 
data, and Clinical Trial Materials Management personnel , (2) the identity of the treatments will 
be concealed by [CONTACT_29952], labeling, schedule of 
administration, and appearance. 
7.2.3. Emerge ncy Unblinding Procedures  
The IXRS will be used, if necessary, for emergency unblinding of treatment assignment during 
the study. The blinded dose information is to be broken only in an emergency when knowledge of such treatment may have an impact on further treatment decisions or aid in the emergency 
treatment of the subject. Any subject for whom the blind is broken is to be discontinued from 
receiving any additional study drug and should undergo early termination procedures as described in Section  14. 
7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
The current study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, laboratory 
classroom study in pediatric subjects with ADHD  weighing ≤ [ADDRESS_29170] of dasotraline ( 2 mg /day) compared with placebo 
over an entire day in a simulated  classroom setting. The laboratory school protocol is a 
particularly useful method for evaluation of efficacy in subjects with ADHD because it 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  34 19 November 2017 represents a controlled study setting for evaluation and comparison of study treatments and is 
designed to mimic a typi[INVESTIGATOR_29908]. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
The dosage of 2 mg /day of dasotraline w as selected to evaluate dasotraline safety , tolerability,  
and efficacy within the dose range being evaluated in the ongoing studies in pediatric subjects 
with ADHD. 
A dasotraline 2 mg /day dose is  expected to produce mg/kg exposures in pediatric subjects 
weighing ≤ [ADDRESS_29171] a diagnosis of ADHD 
established by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that reviewed Diagnostic and  Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) criteria for ADHD (inattentive, 
hyperactive, or combined presentation); diagnosis will be confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School- Age Children Present  and Lifetime Version 
(K-SADS -PL). Subjects are required to weigh ≤ 30 kg since a 2  mg/day dose in such a group is 
expected to have mg/kg exposures similar to those demonstrated to be effective in children and 
adults. 
7.3.4. Rationale for the Endpoints 
The primary efficacy measure (mean SKAMP -Combined Score) is a widely accepted efficacy 
endpoint intended to assess functional impairment related to ADHD and has been used in many 
laboratory classroom studies in children ( Childress-2015, Wigal -2014).  
7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study prior to study 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented; (i) use of clinical 
sites with a good track record of having performed this type of study, (ii) training provided to the 
clinical sites o n the importance of the informed consent/assent process and ensuring subjects and 
their parent/guardian understand the commitment they are making, including the intent to 
complete the trial, and (iii)  monitoring data collection for adherence during the study.  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.[ADDRESS_29172] weighs ≤ [ADDRESS_29173]’s parents /legal guardian s must give written informed consent, 
including privacy authorization, prior to study participation. The subject will provide 
informed assent prior to study participation. 
4. Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition 
(DSM -5) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive, or 
combined presentation) at screening established by a comprehensive psychiatric 
evaluation that reviews DSM- 5 criteria and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia for School- Age Children -Present and Lifetime version 
(K-SADS -PL) at screening.  
5. Subject is currently either untreated for ADHD or receiving  a treatment regimen of a 
stimulant medication prescribed as monotherapy (i.e., methylphenidate, mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamphetamine, or dextroamphetamine)  within th e approved

interview, as well as, review of available medical  records. Note: The ADHD Rating Scale 
Version  IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) ( ADHD- RS-IV 
HV) will be administered at Screening by [CONTACT_29954].  
9. Subject is male or a non -pregnant, non- lactating  female.  
10. Subject, if female, must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and if ≥ [ADDRESS_29175] practice true abstinence (consistent with lifestyle) and must

abnormalities as determined by [CONTACT_093]) b ased on screening physical and 
neurological examinations, medical history, and clinical laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Note: If any of the hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis results are not within the laboratory’s reference range, then the subject can be included only if 
the investigator determines the deviations to be not clinically relevant.  
13. Subject is within the 3rd to 97th percentile for gender specific weight -for-age from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) growth charts. See Section s 24, 
and 25, Appendix V and VI for growth chart s.

10.1. Study Medication  
As described in Section  7.2.1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments ( 2 mg /day 
dasotraline or placebo). 
Under supervision from the subject’s parent/legal guardian, subjects will self- administer the 
study drug on an outpatient basis for [ADDRESS_29188]; the active ingredient is 
an ocular irritant.  
10.2. Treatment Compliance  
During the double- blind period, the clinical site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_29320]’s parent/legal 
guardian dai ly with a reminder to administer study drug.  
The Investigator will record the dose of the study drug and the dates of the initial and final 
administration  for each  dose. 
Compliance with study drug will be monitored closely and determined at each visit. Subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be instructed to b ring all unused study drug with them to the 
Day 15 visit. Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_29958] (per capsule count) by [CONTACT_29959] a visit period and multiplying by 100. Subjects who miss more than 25% of scheduled doses or 
take more than 125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncompliant. Evidence of 
noncompliance must be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor. Potential noncompliance will be  discussed with subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s), and at the investigator’s 
discretion may result in termination of the subject from the study. All subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be reminded of the importance of strict compliance with taking study drug for the effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study.

visit is  presented in  Table 2, Schedule of Assessments.  
Training, as appropriate, will be provided for study site staff administe ring each of the 
effectiveness and safety assessments.  
11.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics include date of birth, sex, ethnicity, race, and medical 
history. For medical, psychiatric , and family psychiatric his tories, only relevant/significant 
history and recurrence of any condition will be collected.  All medications taken during the 
30 day s before signed consent/assent will be recorded; data collected will be the same as for 
concomitant medications (see Section  10.3). Weight, height, and BMI collection are described in 
Section  11.4.5. Physical and neurological examinations are described in Section  11.4.4. 
11.2. Eligibility Assessments  
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School -Age Children Present and 
Lifetime version  (K-SADS -PL) 
The K-SADS -PL will be used at screening to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD.  
The K -SADS -PL is a semi -structured diagnostic interview designed to assess current and past 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_29914]; Text Revision ( DSM -IV-TR) criteria. The 
K-SADS -PL covers a broad spectrum of most child psychiatric diagnoses, with the exception of 
pervasive development disorders and personality disorders. The K- SADS -PL includes questions 
about school performance and other issues relevant to children and adole scents. There is a base 
instrument (82 items) and 5  required diagnostic supplements which are completed depending on 
the results of the base screening: (1)  Affective Disorders; (2) Psychotic Disorders; (3) Anxiety 
Disorders; (4) Behavioral Disorders; (5) Substance Abuse and Other Disorders. 
The K -SADS -PL takes about 45-90 minutes to administer.  
ADHD Rating Scale Version IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) 
(ADHD- RS-IV HV)  
The ADHD -RS-IV HV will be used to assess the presence of clinical ly significant ADHD 
symptoms  on Day  -1. 
The ADHD -RS-IV HV was developed to measure the behaviors of children with ADHD. The 
ADHD- RS-IV HV is a validated scale that consists of [ADDRESS_29195] ic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders  
Fourth Edition; Text Revision  (DSM -IV-TR) criteria and is also consistent with DSM -5 criteria. 
Each item is scored from a range of zero (reflecting no symptoms) to 3  (reflecting severe 
symptoms) with total sco res ranging from zero to  54. The 18 items may be grouped into 
2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even number items  2 through 18) and inattentiveness 
(odd number items 1 through 17). The ADHD- RS-IV HV will be administered to the caregiver 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.[ADDRESS_29196] whenever possible.  
11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale  
The SKAMP is a validated 13 -item rating scale  that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a 
classroom setting through a combined score and 2 subscale scores; deportment items (interacting 
with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the 
teacher’s direction s, and following the classroom rules) and attention items (getting started, 
sticking with tasks, attending to an activity, making activity transitions, completing assigned 
tasks, performing work accurately, and being neat and careful while writing or drawi ng). 
Permanent Product Measure of Performance ( PERMP ) 
The PERMP is a [ADDRESS_29197] consisting of 80 problems per page (total of 400 problems). 
Both attempted problems and correct problems will be assessed. Subjects are to complete as 
many problems as po ssible in [ADDRESS_29198]. Parents/guardians should be queried in a non-
leading manner, without specific prompting (if the child has complained about changes in health and how the child has been feeling ). Subjects should also be queried in a non-leading manner, 
without specific prompting (e.g., “How have you been feeling ? Have you felt different ?). See 
Section  12, Safety Reporting 
AEs and SAEs will be monitored throughout the study at all visits starting after the first dose of 
study drug. 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur prior to the first dose of study drug will be collected as 
pre-treatment events.

his or her supi[INVESTIGATOR_29917]. Vital signs will be obtained prior to clinical laboratory collection and performance of an ECG. 
11.4.4. Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Clinically significant physical examination findings, as judged by [CONTACT_093], at screening 
will be recorded as medical history and after screening will be recorded as AEs  or pre -treatment 
events  depending on t he timing in relationship to the first dose of study drug. 
Neurological examination parameters will be assessed by [CONTACT_29962]. 
11.4.5. Weight and Body Mass Index 
Body weight while wearing street clothes and without shoes will be recorded in kilograms (kg). Height without shoes will be recorded in centimeters (cm). Body mass index will be calculated 
by [CONTACT_29963] ( EDC ) system  using height measured at screening and weight from 
the appropriate visit. 
11.4.6. ECGs  
Centrally -read ECG : All ECGs will be obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], after the subject has 
been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes. ECGs will be 12 -lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. 
ECGs should be obtained prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the 
same ECG recorder for all visits within individual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core 
lab according to established quality assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer

11.4.7. Safety Scales 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) Children’s Assessment  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  50 19 November 2017 The C-SSRS ( Posner-2007) is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the study. The strength of this suicide 
classification system is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting 
the over identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to administer. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C- SSRS. At the screening visit, the lifetime/recent 
version will be completed; for all subsequent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS 
will be administered.  
Subjects who have significant findings for suicidal ideation upon completion of the C- SSRS at 
any time during the study must be referred to the investigator for follow-up evaluation.

Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  53 19 November 2017 12. SAFETY R EPORTING  
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated wit h the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of informed consent/assent and first 
study drug administration are pre -treatment events. Those that occur after first administra tion of 
study drug are considered AEs. 
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit. 
Lack of ef ficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not be reported as an AE 
unless the event is unusual in some way. 
New signs and symptoms of underlying disease, or signs and symptoms of emerging diseas e 
must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious  Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intens ive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarct ion) (s ee Section  12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  54 19 November 2017 "serious," which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by [CONTACT_29967]. 
During the study, if a subject  has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the s tudy e ntry, i.e., before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (e .g., clinical laborator y value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (e.g., viral hepatitis will be recorded as the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the 
sign (e .g., clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (e .g., abdominal 
pain) as the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with 
possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical significance. If the result of any test (or  repeat test, if done) from the samples taken during 
Screening  is indicated as clinically significant and is not covered by [CONTACT_29968]  8, the subject will not be allowed into the study. Additional testing during the 
study may be done if medically indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the EOS  visit, this should be recorded as 
an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (ha ve) normalised or stabilised.  
All on -site ECG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abn ormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.[ADDRESS_29205]’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and AEs/all AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
All AEs will be fo llowed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definitions for severity , 
frequency , action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy

The causal relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment:  
• Not related  
o Not related  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease.  
o Unlikely - occurred within a reasonable time frame after 
administration/discontinuation of the study drug, but there is a likely 
association of an  intercurrent/underlying medical condition or other drugs.  
• Related  
o Possible  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there 
is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug. 
o Definite  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_29969]. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not 
mandatory before assigning a definite causality.

STUDY/ DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG  
13.1. Criteria for Subject Termination  
Subject s may terminate th e study participation  at any time for any reason.  
The possible reasons for the termination of study participation  are as follows : 
• Adverse event.  
• Lack of efficacy (specify).  
• Lost to follow- up (specify).  
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] (specify).  
• Non-compli ance with study drug (specify) . 
• Protocol deviation (specify) . 
• Death . 
• Other (specify).  
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (e.g., e xperiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study treatment . 
The reason for discontinuation and information will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. In case 
of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
Subje cts who prematurely terminate the s tudy participation may  be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug prior to completion will be asked to return to the clinic  and 
complete the EOS visit 7 (±  2) day s later (Section  11.5.3).  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  59 19 November 2017 14. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at this study center or at multiple centers 
for safety or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination does 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well -being . In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever reason, all documentation and s tudy medication s pertaining to the stud y 
must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will be required to return to the clinic and 
complete the EOS visit 7 (±  2) days after their last dose of study drug and provide d with access 
to standard care.  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  60 19 November 2017 15. STATISTICS  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will  be applied to evaluate the treatment effect for the 
primary efficacy endpoint between the dasotraline 2 mg/day and placebo groups for the intent- to-
treat (ITT) population. The model will include treatment, mean SKAMP -Combined score at 
baseline, and site as fixed effects. The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated for the per 
protocol (PP) population. To explore the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis of change 
from baseline at Day  15 in ADHD symptoms in mean SKAMP-Combined score, 2 sensitivity 
analyses will be performed, a placebo -based multiple imputation pattern -mixture model (PMM) 
and a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_29901]. 
A similar ANCOVA model, as described above, will be used for the secondary efficacy 
endpoints for the ITT population. 
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods planned for 
this study and will be finalized before the study  database lock (DBL).  
15.1. Sample Size  
A post- hoc ANCOVA -LOCF analysis of data from the SEP360-[ADDRESS_29214] of dasotraline 4 mg/day versus placebo in a subset of 
pediatric patients  with ADHD aged [ADDRESS_29215] size in this 
subgroup of 0.95 (LS mean difference at Week [ADDRESS_29216] error of 2.2). Assuming a smaller effect size for dasotraline 2  mg/day vs. placebo than that of dasotraline 4 mg/day vs. 
placebo, an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_29217] size also  derives from a  data analysi s showing that in a weight -adjusted dose range 
of 0.065 mg/kg to 0.115 mg/kg , the SKAMP effect size was observed to be 0.70. The weight 
adjusted dosing in the proposed study (SEP360-311) will likely range from 0.057 mg/kg to 
0.125 mg/kg  given that s ix yea r old females are expected to be the lightest subjects (CDC 
estimates 16  kg = 3rd percent ile). Thus, the estimated effect size of .[ADDRESS_29218] siz e of 0.7 for dasotraline 2 mg/day compared to placebo on the 
primary efficacy endpoint of mean SKAMP-Combined score obtained from the average of 
7 assessments collected across the 12  hour classroom day, 88 subjects (44 per treatment group) 
will provide 90% power to detect a treatment effect between dasotraline and placebo at the two-sided alpha level of 0.05, based on the two- sample t- test with equal variance procedure.  
The study will target approximately 100  subjects (50 per treatment group) randomized to either 
placebo or dasotraline 2  mg/day in an attempt to have 88 subjects complete the trial (assuming a 
12% overall dropout rate). 
15.2. Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations are defined below. Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment to 
which they are randomly assigned.

randomized. The ITT population will be used for the efficacy analyses. 
Safety population: The safety population includes all subjects who are randomized and receive at 
least 1 dose of study medication. All safety analyses will be performed using the safety 
population. 
Per Protocol (PP) population: The PP population will consist of all subjects from the ITT 
population without any important protocol deviation (see Section  15.3.3). This supplemental 
efficacy population will be used to assess robustness of the primary analysis results. 
15.3. Data Analysis

subject recruitment material (if applicable) must be provided to Sponsor/CRO prior to start of the 
study.  The approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29926], identify the clinical protocol by [CONTACT_29985]/or protocol number, 
and include the date that approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_11744]. The letter must also contain a statement that the IRB complies with the requirements in 21  CFR Part  56 for a s tudy conducted 
under a U S Investigational New Drug  (IND) or ICH GCP, as applicable.  
The Investigator/CRO is responsible for obtaining from the IRB continued review of the clinical research or submitting periodic progress reports, in accordance with applicable regulations, at 
intervals not to exceed one year and (if applicable) as otherwise additionally specified by [CONTACT_29986]360-311, Version 3.[ADDRESS_29227] promptly inform their IRB of all SA Es reported by [CONTACT_29987]/CRO in accordance with applicable 
law(s) and regulation(s). 
17.3. Informed Consent  
The informed consent form and informed assent form will be approved by [CONTACT_1034]/ CRO 
prior to submission to the IRB. The Sponsor/CRO may provide a template informed consent / 
informed assent form to be qualified by [CONTACT_29988]. 
All informed consent /assent  forms must contain the minimum elements as mandated by [CONTACT_29989], applicable local law(s) and regulations and will be subject to Sponsor /CRO  approval as 
well as IRB approval. The Sponsor /CRO  may submit informed consent forms to a central IRB 
for review and approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29927].  
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject /parent/legal guardian will be given 
a full explanation of the study, allowed to read the approved informed consent form and assent form(s), as appropriate, and be provided ample time and the opportunity to ask any questions that may arise. Once all questions have been answered and the Investigator is assured that the 
prospective subject /parent/legal guardian  understands the implications of participating in the 
study, the prospective subject and at least one parent/legal guardian  will be asked to give consent 
to participate in the study by [CONTACT_29990](s), as appropriate . As 
part of the consent process, each prospective subject  and at least one parent/legal guardian  must 
consent to direct access to the subject’s  medical records for study-related monitoring, auditing, 
IRB review, and regulatory inspection. It should be clearly explained to each prospective 
subject /parent/legal guardian  that participation in each and every clinical visit and assessment is 
expected.  The subject may be discontinued from study medication, but that does not necessarily 
negate the expectation that the subject /parent/legal guardian will continue to participate in the 
study through the final visit/assessment.  The Investigator will provide a copy of the signed 
informed consent form and assent forms to each subject /parent/legal guardian , and will record 
the date of the informed consent and assent on the CRF . 
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, 
or if important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s 
parent’s/legal guardian’s  consent /assent , the informed consent/ assent  form(s) must be revised, 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The revised informed consent /assent  form(s) must be used to obtain consent /assent  from a subject currently enrolled in 
the study if he or she is affected by [CONTACT_29991]. The revised informed consent /assent  form 
must be used to obtain consent from any new subjects who are enrolled into the s tudy after the 
date of the approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29928].  
17.4. Subject Privacy 
The Sponsor (or Sponsor representative)  or any designees affirm uphold the subjects 
confidentiality.  The subject will be identified by [CONTACT_19494]; full names will be masked 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.[ADDRESS_29228]’s personal data shall be  
protected in accordance with appropriate laws and regulations. 
17.5. Protocol Amendments and Emergency Deviations 
All revisions and/or amendments to this protocol must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_29992]. The Investigator will not make any changes to the conduct of the s tudy 
or the protocol without first obtaining written approval from the Sponsor and the IRB, except 
where necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a study subject. 
Emergency deviations or modifications may b e initiated without Sponsor or IRB approval or 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], only in cases where the deviation or modification is necessary to eliminate or avoid an immediate apparent hazard to subjects. Emergency deviations or modifications must be 
reported to the Sponsor/CRO and the IRB immediately/within 5 business days of the occurrence, 
or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
17.6. Records Retention  
The Investigator /the study center must arrange for retention of s tudy records at the study center  
for at least 15  years from time of participation in the study or longer in accordance with 
applicable regulations and Sponsor SOPs. The Investigator /site should take measures to prevent 
accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Documents cannot be destroyed  without 
written Sponsor authorization. The Sponsor will inform the Investigator/ the study center  when 
the destruction of documents is permitted. 
17.7. Inspection of Records  
In the event of an inspection, the Investigator agrees to allow representatives of the Sponsor and  
its representative and , the regulatory authorities’ access to all study records . The Investigator will 
promptly notify the Sponsor /CRO of all requests to inspect a Sunovion-sponsored study by 
[CONTACT_29993] a copy of all such inspection reports. 
17.8. Financial Disclosure  
By [CONTACT_12570], the Investigator agrees to provide to the Sponsor prior to start of study 
accurate financial information to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate certifica tion 
and disclosure statements as required by [CONTACT_29994] (21 CFR Part  54). The 
Investigator further agrees to provide this information on a Financial Disclosure/Certification Form that is provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The Investigator will update this information if there are 
any relevant changes during the conduct of the study and for one year after completion of the study.  
The Investigator also consents to the transmission of this information to the Sponsor for these purposes. This may involve the transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.  
17.9. Publication Policy  
Any formal presentation or publication of data collected as a direct or indirect result of the study will be considered a joint publication by [CONTACT_29995]360-311, Version 3.[ADDRESS_29229] agree not to present data gathered individually or by a subgroup of centers before 
the full, initial publication, unless this has been agreed to by [CONTACT_29996].

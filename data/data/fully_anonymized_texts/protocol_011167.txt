Protocol  Summary  
 
This is a phase  II, single -arm trial assessing  local control  (ie. no local failure)  after near-total 
endoscopic  resection (NTR)  followed  by [CONTACT_127119]- beam  radiation  
in unresectable  tumors  (which  we define as expected inability  to perform  negative margin 
surgery)  of the paranasal  sinuses  and nasal  cavity.   We will compare rate of local failure  at 1 
year after treatment   in those undergoing NTR and adjuvant  treatment  with historical  rates  of 
failure in those undergoing non surgical  management.   As secondary  and exploratory  
endpoints,  we will assess  other oncologic  outcomes  (overall  survival,  progression free 
survival,  etc), physician  reported complications  of surgery  and chemoradiation  toxicity,  and 
patient  reported outcomes,  and will store tissues  obtained for IMPACT  testing.  
We plan to have [ADDRESS_143372] 10 shall be Adenoid Cystic  Carcinoma,  Esthesioneuroblastoma,  or 
Adenocarcinoma patients.

Primary  Objective  
 
• To determine  if near-total resection with minimally  invasive endoscopic  approach  for 
unresectable  paranasal  sinus  / nasal  cavity  tumors  followed  by [CONTACT_127120]- beam  radiation improves  local control  at 1 year after 
treatment  compared to traditional  approaches  of nonsurgical  management  alone.  Our 
historical  data showed that the rate of local failure  at 1 year with chemotherapy  and 
IMRT  alone is 50%.  We hypothesize  that adding NTR and proton radiation  with 
chemotherapy  will reduce the rate of local failure  at 1-year to 25%.  Local  failure will be 
defined using a modification of RECIST  1.1. 
Secondary Objectives  
 
• To assess the complications  of treatment  related to minimally  invasive endoscopic  
skull base  surgery  in patients  with unresectable disease using Clavien -Dindo  
classification  of surgical  complications  
• To assess toxicity  of treatment  based  on CTCAE  v4.03  scores in the acute  setting  
(throughout  treatment  and up to the 3 month visit after end of treatment)  
• To assess  toxicity of treatment  based  on CTCAE  v4.03  scores in the long-term setting 
(after  the [ADDRESS_143373] treatment  visit) 
• To assess  toxicity  of treatment  related to patient  reported outcomes  including EORTC 
(H&N43  and C30)  and Skull Base  Inventory  (SBI)  
• To determine the 1- and 2-year rates  of regional/nodal,   or distant -metastasis  
progression incidence,  progression- free survival,  disease specific  mortality,  and 
overall  survival  in our group of patients  undergoing  NTR / proton- beam  radiation 
therapy  (PBRT)  and chemotherapy  
• To obtain  tissue  of these  rare tumor  types  for IMPACT   assessement.  Results  of 
IMPACT   testing  will be banked for future  investigation  
3.1 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
3.2 Nasal  Cavity / Paranasal  Sinus  Tumors  
 
Locally  advanced malignancies  of the nasal  cavity  and paranasal  sinuses  that invade the skull 
base are rare with unclear  management  paradigms.  Beginning in the 1950s,  the "gold 
standard"  for treatment  of these malignancies,  when  resectable,  has been a combined 
transfacial  and transcranial  approach followed  by [CONTACT_127121]1. Memorial  Sloan  
Kettering Cancer  Center  has been a global  leader  in the management  of these  patients  and 
coordinated a large retrospective multi- institutional  study  that set the standard for rates  of  
both oncologic  control  and treatment  related morbidity  for patients  with resectable disease2,3. 
This work  was first published in 2003.  However,  when  tumors  are deemed unresectable by  
[CONTACT_127122],  often  because of proximity  to the carotid artery,  brain 
parenchymal  invasion,  or involvement  of the orbital  apex,  radiation (with or without  
chemotherapy)  has been  the primary  treatment  pursued.  Outcomes  for locally  advanced 
paranasal  sinus/nasal  cavity  tumors  that receive  radiation (with or without  chemotherapy)  are 
significantly  worse  than seen in patients  who undergo surgery  followed by [CONTACT_54615] (+/- 
chemotherapy)4. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 442 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_143374] 15 years,  advances  in the pathologic  understanding of these tumors,  
chemotherapeutic  treatment  options,  and radiation  technology,  has led to significant  variation  
of treatment  of locally  advanced nasal  cavity and paranasal  sinus  cancers.  The definition  of 
"resectability"  has been  altered and tumors  that were  once considered nonsurgical  (such  as 
those with brain invasion)  are now deemed  resectable in many  centers.  Furthermore,  single  
institution studies  have demonstrated the technical  and oncologic  feasibility  of endoscopic  
resection for select  early and advanced paranasal  sinus  and skull base tumors,  obviating  the 
need for craniotomy  and facial  incisions,  leading to decreased surgery -related  treatment  
morbidity  in certain patients5,6. 
 
Unresectable paranasal  sinus  and nasal  cavity  tumors  treated with photon  radiation (3D 
conformal  or IMRT)  +/- chemotherapy  have poor outcomes,  with MSKCC data revealing 
overall  survival  of 15% at 5 years,  with a 0% local control  rate for patients  who receive  less 
than 65 gray to the primary  site 4. In studies  of salivary  gland tumors,  including adenoid  cystic 
carcinoma,  historic  local control  rates  with radiaton +/- chemotherapy  have been  0-43%7-12. 
This is in contrast  to recent  retrospective  data that shows  endoscopic  or open surgery  and 
proton radiation (+/- chemotherapy)  in a variety  of pathologies  in locally  advanced tumors,  
yields  local control  at 1 and 3 years  of 92.4%  and 82.7%13.  Russo  et al recently  published 5- 
year local control  rates  after resection  and proton radiation to be 77% for those  patients  who 
have undergone gross  total resection (not synonymous  with negative margin  surgery —gross  
total resection includes  patients  with negative  margins  and microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_127099])14. 
 
The suboptimal  outcomes  related to chemoradiation therapy  alone coupled with the promise  
of trimodality  therapy  using minimally  invasive surgery  have introduced the idea of 
cytoreductive  surgery  for advanced disease  prior to chemoradiotherapy.   Although these 
cytoreductive interventions  can often help with symptoms  related to the tumor  size, the 
oncologic  validity  of these approaches  have yet to be determined15.  Jansen et al have 
published the only study  of the utility  of subtotal  resection in paranasal  sinus  cancers  and they 
found  improved  local control  and overall  survival  with debulking  and conventional  photon 
IMRT16. In a retrospective  study  by [CONTACT_127123],  the authors  noted  that degree of residual  tumor  burden after skull base 
surgery  correlated with patient  outcomes17. 
 
In addition  to improved  local control,  cytoreductive  surgery  may allow for the reduction  of 
radiation doses  to normal  structures,  such  as the optic nerves,  chiasm,  carotid arteries,  and 
temporal  lobes.  This could reduce the probability  of late cognitive,  vascular,  and visual  
toxicities.   Historically,  convention argued against  subtotal  surgical  resection in these  
patients,  as the only option was open  surgery  with craniotomy  and facial  incisions;  such  
operations  often required  free flap reconstruction and led to prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127100],  with 
mortality  rates  of 5% at the most  experienced centers,  as well as an overall  complication rate 
of 36%,  a central  nervous  system  complication  rate of 16% (CSF  leak, meningitis,  
pneumocephalus),  and a wound complication  rate of 20% (infection,  dehiscence,  flap 
necrosis)3. Prolonged  recovery  in these patients  can also potentially  lead to delays  in adjuvant  
chemoradiotherapy.  However,  the use of minimally  invasive  surgical  techniques  have 
shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127100],  as such  procedures  obviate  the need  for external  incisions  with free 
flap reconstruction and can decrease the risk of CSF leaks  and infections.  Such  reductions  in 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 442 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_143375] demonstrated  that those  undergoing endoscopic  excision  of paranasal  
sinus  tumors  start postoperative radiation (+/- chemotherapy)  approximately  20 days earlier  
than those undergoing  open craniofacial  resection18. In addition,  on the national  level there  is 
no significant  difference  in the time to starting radiation after diagnosis  for those undergoing 
endoscopic  surgery  plus radiation compared to those  not receiving surgery  at all18. 
 
The feasibility  and oncologic  efficacy  of near-total resection in unresectable paranasal  
sinus/nasal  cavity  tumors  followed  by [CONTACT_127124].  This is in contrast  to clival  chordomas,  which  occur  in the same anatomic  
region and for which  near-total resection coupled with adjuvant  chemoradiotherapy  has been 
shown to result  in better  outcomes  than nonsurgical  or less aggressive  surgical  treatment  
alone19. The extent  of resection of chordoma has been directly  correlated to outcomes  in a 
meta- analysis20. In other  brain and base of skull lesions,  the degree of resection as a 
continuous  variable is positively  associated with survival21,22. Proton beam  radiation,  which  is 
the preferred option  for the treatment  of skull base and pediatric  tumors  at many  centers,  can 
potentially  minimize  toxicity to adjacent  structures  to an even greater  degree  than was 
possible  previously.  The combination  of near-total endoscopic  resection,  because of its 
reduction  in gross  disease requiring the highest  dose of radiation,  and proton radiation,  
because of its ability  to spare normal  tissue,  may lead to significant  reductions  in treatment - 
related toxicity.  
 
The prior studies  including  Jansen et al are retrospective assessments  of outcome based  on 
extent  of surgical  resection followed by [CONTACT_127125],  for patients  that are presumably  
resectable.  Our study  is a prospective evaluation of the utility  of addition  of surgery  in patients  
that otherwise may not have received it in order  to assess the utility  of endoscopic  near total 
resection and proton radiation with chemotherapy.   We want to rigorously  study  in a 
prospective  fashion the ability  to improve  oncologic  outcomes  for patients  with this rare tumor  
type.

areas  including soft tissues  of the cheek,  intraorbital  contents,  and significant  intracranial  
extension,  however,  an endoscopic  resection approach  does provide adequate  access  for 
many  patients  without  an extensive  craniotomy  and lateral  rhinotomy  (facial  incision).  In 
addition,  the adoption of the regional  vascularized nasoseptal  flap provides  a safe way to 
reconstruct  large intranasal  defects,  preventing the need for free flap or other  reconstruction.  
Because  of the minimally  invasive  nature of the techniques,  patients  undergoing endoscopic  
skull base surgery  leave  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127101], consequently,  the time to adjuvant  treatment  is decreased.   In addition,  for locally  
advanced lesions,  a cytoreductive surgery  can potentially  decrease  the tumor  volume  prior to 
adjuvant  radiation in an anatomic  area where a difference of a few millimeters  in the radiation 
target  area can be critical.  
 
3.4 Characteristics of Proton Beam  Radiation  Therapy  (PBRT)  
 
Intensity  modulated radiation  therapy  (IMRT),  the most  commonly  used form of photon  beam  
radiation therapy  in the treatment  of HNC,  uses multiple  x-ray beams  to irradiate a tumor  
target,  but deposits  not insignificant  exit dose delivered to normal  tissues  beyond the 
treatment  target.  PBRT  utilizes  multiple  beams  of directed  protons  to irradiate a tumor  target.  
But in contrast  to photons,  protons  deposit  the bulk of their energy  at the last few millimeters  
of their range without  any significant  exit dose23.  Both radiotherapy  modalities  aim to 
maximize  the dose of radiation to the tumor  while  sparing surrounding normal  tissues  like the 
oral cavity,  salivary  glands,  larynx,  muscles of the head and neck,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102],  and brainstem.  
However,  given  the physical  characteristics  of protons  (i.e. minimal exit dose),  PBRT  may 
deliver  radiation with less accompanying morbidity  from damage  to surrounding non- 
malignant  tissue  when compared with IMRT  (Figure  1) 24-27. This is especially  critical  in the 
skull base where damage  to adjacent  structures  such  as the brainstem,  optic nerves,  orbit,  
brain parenychema  can have catastrophic  consequences.   Indeed,  the need to limit dose to 
normal  structures often results  in some degree  of underdosing to paranasal  sinus  and nasal  
cavity tumors.   Because PBRT  dramatically  reduces  the dose of radiation to normal  
structures,  it may allow for a larger  proportion of tumor  to receive  therapeutic  radiation doses.  
Indeed,  a recently  published retrospective  study  presented evidence that such a benefit  leads  
to improved local control  compared to photon radiotherapy.[ADDRESS_143377]  of radiation dose 
alterations  on clinical  outcomes.  PBRT  could result  in increased skin toxicity compared  to

photon- based therapy.  
 
 
 
3.5 Patient  Reported Outcome  (PRO)  
 
A patient  reported outcome (PRO)  is a measurement  of a patient’s  health  status  that is 
obtained  directly  from the patient  without  interpretation of the patient’s  responses  by a 
clinician  or research  associate.  The Health  and Medicine Division  (formerly  the Institute  of 
Medicine)  of the National  Academies  of Medicine and the Food and Drug  Administration  
(FDA)  have called  for measuring PROs  as primary  or secondary  endpoints  of clinical   
trials29,30. Studies  have shown that PROs  can be more  reflective of the patient  experience and 
provide more  complementary  toxicity  and symptom  data than clinical  or Common 
Terminology  Criteria  of Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  assessments  alone31,32. In this trial, the 
secondary  endpoints  will be based on clinician -reported CTCAEs  as well as patient  reported 
outcomes.  
 
Radiotherapy  to the head  and neck and, more  specifically,  to the skull base,  is associated 
with marked acute  and late adverse effects. Acute  effects  include  paranasal  sinus  crusting  
and bleeding,  mucositis,  dysphagia,  fatigue,  dysgeusia,  loss of voice,  nausea,  and fatigue.  
Late effects  include  xerostomia,  dysphagia,  trismus,  permanent  skin changes,  neck fibrosis,  
and secondary  malignancies.  Careful  assessment  of treatment  related morbidity  is important,  
as patients  who experience significant  acute  side effects  of HNC radiation therapy  are 
reported to have a decreased quality  of life33-38. Significant  deterioration is associated with 
those who report  having trismus,  xerostomia,  dysgeusia,  and dental  problems.  PBRT  can 
deliver  radiation with reduced  dose to nearby  [CONTACT_127126]  (e.g.,  oral cavity,  major  salivary  
glands,  larynx,  cochlea,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102],  brainstem,  and brain),  and potentially  improve PRO.  
However,  research on PRO  after proton therapy  is scarce.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 442 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_143380] significantly  worse  outcomes  with these 
large -volume  tumors,  which  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_127103];  the 
associated toxicities  can be significant.  Endoscopic  near-total resection,  when compared with 
open surgery,  offers  the possibility  of tumor  debulking with minimal morbidity  and shorter  
recovery.   We hypothesize  that multimodality  treatment  involving  endoscopic  near-total 
resection and adjuvant  proton radiotherapy  will both minimize  toxicity  and, most  importantly,  
improve  local control.  A treatment  paradigm  involving the potential  dosimetric  advantages  of 
postoperative proton treatment  as well as minimal morbidity  for endoscopic  resection  has the 
potential  to change the treatment  approach  for patients  with these lesions.  
The primary  endpoint  of this study  is to assess the local control  for patients  with unresectable 
disease,  with secondary  endpoints  of distant  metastasis  development,  disease free survival,  
overall  survival,  morbidity  of treatment,  and patient  reported outcomes.  Our study  may also 
help to standardize  treatment  algorithms  which,  at this time,  are widely  divergent  for patients  
with unresectable  disease.   If patients  in this study  demonstrate favorable  outcomes,  future  
studies  could address  the feasibility  of cytoreductive  surgical  techniques  with adjuvant  
chemotherapy  and proton- beam  radiation to improve outcomes  in patients  with “resectable”  
disease.  
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single  center,  phase  II, single -arm trial assessing  the efficacy  of local control  of near- 
total endoscopic  resection followed  by [CONTACT_127127]- beam  radiation with concurrent  chemotherapy   
in unresectable  paranasal  sinus/nasal  cavity  tumors.  The primary  endpoint  is local control  at 1 
year from the end of treatment  with failure defined  as progression of disease by > 20% of the 
[ADDRESS_143381] treatment  MRI  (per RECIST)  compared to the post- surgical  MRI. If a patient  
dies during treatment,  he/she will be counted  as a failure.  We will secondarily  assess 
regional/nodal  failure  and distant  metastases,  overall  survival,  disease specific  mortality,  and 
progression free survival.  Treatment  toxicity  will be assessed by [CONTACT_105469] -Dindo  
Classification  of Surgical  Complications  and CTCAE  v4.[ADDRESS_143382]  testing  will be banked for future  
investigation.  We will include  patients  with a variety  of histologic  diagnoses  including  
squamous  cell carcinoma  (SCC),  esthesioneuroblastoma,  adenoid cystic  carcinoma,  and 
adenocarcinoma..  Patients  will be included if there is multidisciplinary  consensus  that the 
primary  lesion  is not resectable with negative margin surgery  without  significant  morbidity.  
This could include  lesions  that (1) involve the carotid artery,  (2) invade brain  parenchyma,  (3) 
involve  the orbital  apex,  (4) invade the pterygoid  musculature,  (5) involve  the cavernous

sinus,  (6) involve  the clivus,  and/or  (7) involve  intraconal  space.  Patients  will only be included 
if there  is multidisciplinary  consensus  that at least 80% of the tumor  bulk can be removed  
without  significant  risk of morbidity.  There is no cut-off for residual  disease.  Although   
expected that we will resect  >80%  of patient’s  tumor  as discussed  pre-operatively,  if less than 
this is resected,  patient  will still proceed with protocol.  Patients  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_127128].  
As this study  is going  to include  patients  for which  we will be unable  to obtain  negative 
margins  (resections  will take place for patients  where we can anticipate removal  of >80%  but 
less than the entirety  of the tumor).  Our prospective  study  will be evaluating patients  who we 
cannot  obtain a negative  margin.  The inclusion  criteria  for our study  exclude  patients  with 
resectable disease.  R1 resections  will be unlikely  due to patient  selection but will still be 
included if they met the initial inclusion  criteria.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients  in this single -arm study  will undergo  near-total endoscopic  resection of skull base 
tumors  (≥ 80%)  followed  by [CONTACT_127129] -based  chemotherapy  with proton- beam  
radiation.

head and neck surgery  and radiation therapy  patients  on this trial. We will use the EORTC  HN 
measure and SBI measure.  
 
4.3.3 Study Specific  PRO  Instruments  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] EORTC QLQ  H&N 43 and C30 
 
The European Organization  for Research and Treatment  of Cancer  Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire  Head and Neck  Module 43 (Appendix  1) is a validated  43-item site-specific  
assessment  tool40.The module  uses [ADDRESS_143384]  . In addition,  7 single- item scales  are utilized  in assessing  
problems  with mouth  opening,  coughing,  , neurology,  weight  loss,lymphedema and/or  a 
wound,and,  finally,  social  contact.  All questions  are based on a 4-point scale  ranging from 
“not at all” to “very  much. ” 
 
The scoring  procedure  for the QLQ-H&N43  transforms  all of the scale  and single -item scores  
to range from 0 to 100.  All QLQ-H&N43  scores are symptom  scores,  with higher  scores

Version   
  
representing higher  levels  of symptomatology/problems.   Internal  consistency  reliability  for the 
multi-item scales  was generally  acceptable (Cronbach’s  alpha ≥ 0.70)  in the validation.  
The EORTC  QLQ  H&N 43 module  was designed to be used together  with the core 
questionnaire QLQ C30 (Appendix  2), which  is an assessment  of general  well being.  
The EORTC  QLQ -C30 (Appendix  2) is a 30-item questionnaire designed to assess the quality  
of life of cancer  patients41.  The [ADDRESS_143385]  scores.  These include  one Global  Health  
Status/QoL  scale  (2 items),  five functional  scales  (Physical  Functioning,  5 items; Role 
Functioning,  2 items;  Emotional  Functioning,  4 items;  Cognitive  Functioning,  2 items;  and 
Social Functioning,  2 items),  three symptom  scales  (Fatigue,  3 items;  Nausea and Vomiting,  2 
items;  and Pain,  2 items),  and six single item symptom  scores  (Dyspnea,  Insomnia,  Appetite 
Loss,  Constipation,  Diarrhea,  and Financial  Difficulties;  all from single  items).  The 
questionnaire asks patients  to indicate  the extent  to which  they have experienced each of the 
problems  “during the past week”  on a 4-point Likert -type scale  from “Not at all” to “Very  
much”.  The 2 exceptions  are the 2 items  of the Global  Health  Status/QoL  scale,  which  
patients  are asked to rate on a 7-point scale  from “Very  poor”  to “Excellent”.  
The scoring  procedure for the QLQ -C3042 transforms  all of the scale  and single- item scores  to 
range from 0 to 100.  High scores for the Global  Health  Status/QoL  scale  represents  high  
QoL,  high scores  for the functional  scales  represent  high/healthy  levels  of functioning,   but 
high scores  for the symptom  scales/items  represent  high levels  of symptomatology/problems.  
The instrument  has been  extensively  validated  and is widely  used in clinical trials.  The multi-  
item scales  generally  have good  internal  consistency  reliability  coefficients.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skull  Base Inventory  
 
Skull Base  Inventory  (Appendix  3) is a 41-item site-specific  assessment  tool designed to 
assess quality  of life in patients  with anterior  skull base pathology43. The SBI covers  11 
disease- specific  domains,  including emotional,  social,  physical,  cognitive,  family,  financial,  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312],  endocrine,  nasal,  neurologic,  and visual.   The 41 items  are based  on a 7-point scale  
ranging from” severe problem ” to “no problem ”. Each  domain  is scored  out of 100 with lower  
scores  associated with poorer  quality  of life. Items  within  each domain  for which  a response 
was recorded were summed and averaged out of 100. A composite score  assuming 
equivalent  weighting  of domains  in overall  quality  of life was created by [CONTACT_127130].  Recently,  the SBI has been validated  and shown  to be reliable  in assessing  disease-  
specific  quality  of life for patients  undergoing  both endoscopic  and open skull base surgery44.

removed only to that layer,  if feasible.  Use of recently  integrated technology,  mainly  high 
definition  straight  and angled endoscopes,  as well as intraoperative  image guidance 
(CT/MRI/PET),  have made  this surgical  technique  significantly  safer.  
 
5.2 Adjuvant Proton Radiotherapy 
 
Proton therapy  treatment  will follow the National Cancer  Institute’s  “Guidelines  for the Use of 
Proton Radiation Therapy  in NCI-Sponsored Cooperative  Group Trials”  
(https://rrp.cancer.gov/content/docs/proton.doc).  Proton  therapy  techniques  may include  
passively  scattered  or scanning or pencil  beam  technology.  
 
5.3 Cisplatin  Chemotherapy 
 
Cisplatin  should be administered  on day 1 (+/- 3 days)  of the start of radiotherapy  and then 
every  3 weeks  (unless  there is a delay  for safety  concerns  such  as neutropenia)  for a total of 
3 cycles.  Treatment  can be given  over 1 day or split over 2 days.   The chemotherapy  will be 
administered  per MSKCC  guidelines  at 100 mg/m2  (dose reductions  after the first cycle  
allowed  for toxicity).  Normal  scheduled treatment  can be +/- [ADDRESS_143387] cycle  of treatment  due to toxicity  (e.g.,  
kidney  failure),  a change in chemotherapy  is allowed  after a discussion  with the medical  
oncology  co-PI. 
5.[ADDRESS_143388],  the 
patient  will receive  cisplatin  on day 1(+/- 3 days)  of the start of radiotherapy  and then every  3 
weeks  (unless  there is a delay  for safety concerns)  for a total of three  cycles.  In addition  to 
cisplatin  at 60 mg/m2  on day 1, the patient  will receive etoposide chemotherapy  at a dose of 
120 mg/m2  on days 1-3. Normal  scheduled treatment  can be +/- [ADDRESS_143389] the prior administration.   The chemotherapy  will be administered  per MSKCC guidelines  
(dose  reductions  after the first cycle  allowed for toxicity).  Administration  entails  fluid and anti- 
emetics  as per institution  standard.  Cisplatin  can be administered  before or after radiation is 
given  but is only started once the radiation program  has been  initiated.  If cisplatin  treatment  
in contraindicated after the first cycle  of treatment  due to toxicity  (e.g.,  kidney  failure),  a 
change in chemotherapy  is allowed  after a discussion with the medical  oncology  co-PI.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
7.1 General  Recruitment  Plan 
 
Patients  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_127133],  the Division  of Head and Neck  Surgery,  Department  of Surgery,  the Department  of 
Neurosurgery,  or Department  of Medical  Oncology,  and entered into the study  if they are 
appropriate candidates.  The attending physician will obtain informed consent  from the eligible  
patients.  
The protocol  investigator,  co-investigator(s),  or a member  of the treatment  team  can screen 
medical  records  of patients  with whom  they have a therapeutic  relationship  to identify  
potential  research subjects  eligible  for this study.  In addition,  protocol  investigator,  co- 
investigator(s),  and research  study  assistant(s)  can screen medical  records  of patients  with 
whom  they do not have a therapeutic  relationship  for the limited  purpose of identifying 
patients  who would  be eligible  to enroll  in the study,  and to record appropriate contact  
[CONTACT_127134].  
During  the initial  conversation  between the investigator,  the research staff, and the patient,   
the patient  may be asked to provide certain health  information that is necessary  for the 
recruitment  and enrollment  process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  
of the patient’s  medical  records  at MSKCC in order  to further  assess  eligibility.  They  will use 
the information provided by [CONTACT_17491]/or  medical  record  to confirm  whether  the patient  is 
eligible  and to contact  [CONTACT_127135].  If the patient  is deemed  
ineligible  for the research  study,  the investigator  and/or  research study  assistant  will destroy  
all information collected during  the initial conversation  and medical  records  review,  except  for 
any information that must  be maintained for screening log purposes.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 442 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_143396]  will be conducted  either  by [CONTACT_127136],  the investigator,  or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the 
treatment  team.  The recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the 
privacy  of the patients  who are screened,  and minimal  PHI will be maintained as part of a 
screening log. For these reasons,  we seek a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization for the 
purposes  of (1) reviewing  medical  records  to identify  potential  research  subjects,  and obtain 
information  relevant  to the enrollment  process;  (2) conversing  with patients  regarding possible  
enrollment;  (3) handling  of PHI contained within  those records  and provided by [CONTACT_83699];  and (4) maintaining information in a screening log of patients  approached (if 
applicable).  
After initial contact  [CONTACT_10970],  our research  team  will contact  [CONTACT_127137]  (NYPC)  team  to initiate  financial  approval.  The financial  team  at ProCure or 
NYPC will work  closely  with the patient  and their insurance plan to determine  his/her  financial  
responsibility  in regards  to proton therapy.  The patient  will have all appropriate information  
prior to enrolling on the protocol.  
7.2 Gender/race breakdowns  
 
In selecting patients  for this study  and the projects  proposed  in this protocol,  we have taken  
due notice  of NIH/ADAMHA  policies  concerning inclusion of women  and minorities  in clinical  
research  populations.  We expect  that the study  population will be representative of the range 
of paranasal  sinus/nasal  cavity  patients  seen at MSKCC.  No specific  outreach  efforts  are 
planned.  
7.3 Target/planned  enrollment  
 
The anticipated accrual  rate is 1-2 patients  per month to meet  the accrual  goal of 25 patients  
(15 SCC and 10 ACC,  esthesio,  or Adenocarcinoma).   Based  on recent  patient  treatment  
patterns  in the head  and neck and radiation oncology  services,  we estimate that MSK treats  
approximately  [ADDRESS_143397]  of care for 
their paranasal/nasal  cavity  malignancy.  
Table  2 contains  all the tests that will be performed  within  8 weeks  of the start of surgery  and 
then chemoradiation.

9.1:  Endoscopic  Resection Treatment Technology 
 
Endoscopic  skull base surgery  will be performed as per standard of care for any patient  with 
tumors  of the paranasal  sinus  and skull base treated at MSK,  as described above.  For 
patients  who have had surgery  elsewhere,  they will be enrolled as long as standard of care 
parameters  per MSKCC were met at the outside  institution.  Tissue used for IMPACT  testing  
will be taken from the main  specimen  during the operation.  For those who have had surgery  
elsewhere,  tissue  will be requested from the outside  institution.  The corresponding  blood 
required for IMPACT  testing will be drawn prior to the surgery.

Standard simulation  CT guidelines  from the vertex  of the scalp  through the tracheal  carina,  
encompassing the entire head and neck.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_143399] scan.  The CTV Primary  Site will include the 
preoperative  gross  extent  of primary  tumor  visible  by [CONTACT_20521]  (CT, PET,  and/or  MRI),  
and/or  clinical  examination along  with the postoperative surgical  bed; for histologies  with high 
risk of neutropic  spread,  a CTV Nerve  will be created to encompass  the affected  nerve  
tracks.  Fusion  of preoperative  and postoperative MRI to the simulation  CT should be 
performed  to aide in volume  delineation.  Irradiation  of cervical  and retropharyngeal  nodal  basins  
will be left up to the treating radiation oncologist.  For patients  in whom  the cervical  and 
retropharyngeal  nodes  will be treated,  the CTV Node  High Risk volume will include  nodal  basins  
wherein  gross  nodal  was resected;  CTV Node Low Risk will include nodal  basins  in which  there 
was no gross  nodal  disease identified.   If there  are suspected grossly  involved  lymph  nodes,  a 
volume GTV Gross  Node  should be created.  Skin bolus  is acceptable and can be used for 
patients  who are at high risk for skin involvement,  at the discretion of the treating physician.  
Each  CTV will be expanded by 3mm to a planning  target  volume  (PTV),  to account  for intra- 
fractional  patient  motion,  and inter-fractional  setup  error.  The above are all standard radiation 
oncology  treatment  planning procedures.

PTV Node Low Risk = 51 Gy (RBE).  
9.2.4 Compliance  Criteria  and Dose -Volume  Histogram  (DVH)  Analysis 
 
Standard of care target  coverage  will be applied.  Target  coverage  for PBRT  should  achieve a 
D95 ≥ prescription dose and the PTV D05 ≤ 110%  of the prescription dose.  
Organs  at risk (OAR),  including  the parotid glands,  submandibular  glands,  cochleas,  oral 
cavity,  larynx,  esophagus,  brachial  plexus,  brain stem,  optic structures,  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102],  
should  be contoured  according to standard  guidelines  for standard of care practice.  A dose 
volume  histogram  will be constructed  to evaluate  target  coverage  and the doses  to the 
surrounding  OAR. The following  standard of care radiation planning guidelines  should  be met: 
1) Larynx:  
a. <70 Gy (RBE)  maximum  point dose  
b. <45 Gy (RBE)  mean dose 
2) Esophagus:  
a. <34 Gy (RBE)  mean  dose to the esophagus

will take priority  over coverage of the tumor.  This is followed by [CONTACT_127139],  
larynx,  esophagus,  oral cavity,  contralateral  parotid,  and contralateral  submandibular  glands.  
 
9.2.6 Planning  
 
The initial phase  of 30 fractions  will include all gross  (PTV expansions  of GTV)  and 
microscopic  (PTV expansions  of CTV)  disease volumes.   The final boost  of 5 fractions  will 
include  only gross  disease (PTV  expansions  of GTV).  Normally,  this course  of radiation 
treatment  will take 7 weeks  to complete.  
Proton therapy  will be planned in CMS XIO (Elekta;  Stockholm,  Sweden)  and 
RayStation(Raysearch  labs,Stockholm  Sweden),  and delivered with uniform  scanning or

9.3 Cisplatin  Chemotherapy 
 
Cisplatin  should be administered on days 1-2, 21-22, and 42-43 of radiotherapy  at a dose of 
100mg/m2.   The chemotherapy  will be administered per MSKCC guidelines  at 100 mg/m2  
every  three weeks.  Normal  scheduled treatment  can be +/- [ADDRESS_143402] 
the prior administration.   Administratoin entails  pre-hydration with 1000 cc of Normal  Saline  
(NS) and  mannitol  25% before and after  treatment.  Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  (150 mg),  palanosetron 
(250 mcg),  and decadron  (12 mg)  infusions  are used for anti-emetic  support  before 
treatment.  Cisplatin  100 mg/m2  is infused over one hour.  Cisplatin  can be administered 
before or after radiation is given  but is only started  once the radiation program  has been 
initiated.  
If the final surgical  pathology  report  shows  SNUC,  at the discretion of the treating medical  
oncologist,  the patient  will receive  an addition of etoposide  chemotherapy  to cisplatin  
chemotherapy.  The dose of cisplatin  will be decresed from 100 mg/m2  to 60 mg/m2.  Cisplatin  
should  be administered  on days 1-2, 21-22 and 42-43 at a dose of 60 mg/m2  and Etoposide  
should be administered at days 1-3, 21-23, and 42-44 at a dose of 120 mg/m2.  Infusion rate, 
anti-emetics,  hydration will be administered  as per institution’s  standard or physician’s  choice . 
 
The post-chemotherapy  administration  protocol  requires  two days of intravenous  hydration  
with 1000 cc NS following  the day of cisplatin  treatment  in the chemotherapy  suite.  
Dexamethasone  12 mg will be administered  IV/PO  on each of these days.  
 
As needed  anti-nausea medications  will be prescribed for home  and include  Zofran 8 mg PO 
every  8 hours,  Ativan  0.5 mg PO every  6 hours,  and Compazine 10 mg every  6 hours.  Patient  
will be advised to report  any fever  of 100.5 or greater  or uncontrolled nausea or vomiting   
while  at home.  
9.4 Permitted Suppor tive/ Ancillary Care and Concomitant Medications 
 
All supportive therapy  for optimal  medical  care will be given during the study  period at the 
discretion of the attending physician(s)  within  the parameters  of the protocol,  and documented 
on each site’s  source  documents  as ancillary  care or concomitant  medication.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
11.1.1  Expected side effects  of endoscopic  skull  base  surgery  
 
The expected side effects  of endoscopic  skull base surgery  are managed in a routine fashion  
in the outpatient  setting.  These include  nasal  crusting  requiring in-office  debridements,  
temporary  decrease in smell  and taste,  foul smell and taste,  and nasal  congestion.   Possible 
complications  of endoscopic  skull base surgery  (with the rates  as per the largest  series)  
include  carotid artery  injury  (<0.5%),  non-life-threatening  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]  (2%),  postoperative CSF 
leak requiring conservative or operative intervention (5%) 45-48. Corresponding rates  among  
the endoscopic  skull base surgery  team  here at MSKCC are 0%, 1.6%,  3.2%.  We will use the 
Clavien- Dindo  classification  of surgical  complications,  which  grades  from I-V the morbidity  
related to a specific  postoperative complication 39. 
11.1.2  Expected side effects  of radiation  therapy 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 442 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_143405] of the adverse events  and potential  risks associated with radiotherapy  of the head  and 
neck appear  below  and will determine whether  dose delays  and modifications  will be made,  or 
whether  the event  requires  expedited reporting in addition to routine reporting.  
Radiation  side effects  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_127106]  (during radiation  and 
up to 3 months  after radiation),  and those that occur  later (>[ADDRESS_143406]-radiation).  
11.1.3  Expected side effects  of Cisplatin  
 
The side effects  of cisplatin  include,  but are not limited  to, nausea,  vomiting,  decreased white  
blood count  (more  susceptible to infections),  decreased red blood  cells (or anemia,  with a risk 
of needing a blood  transfusion),  decreased platelets  (making  it easier  to bleed),  fatigue,  
reversible  hair loss, electrolyte abnormalities  (e.g., hyponatremia,  hypokalemia,  
hypomagnesemia),  hearing loss, neuropathy,  and kidney  failure.  
11.1.4  Expected side effects  of Cisplatin  and etoposide 
 
The side effects  of cisplatin  plus etoposide include,  but are not limited  to nausea,  vomiting,  
decreased white  blood cell count  (more  susceptible to infections),  decreased red blood cells 
(or anemia,  with risk of needing blood transfusion),  decreased platelets  (making  it easier  to 
bleed),  fatigue,  hair loss, hearing  loss, kidney  failure,  sores  is mouth  leading  to dysphagia,  
electrolyte  abnormalities,  neuropathy,  fevers,  chills,  allergic  reaction,  confusion,  difficulty  with 
imbalance,  cardiovascular  event  including  heart  failure,  skin rash,  liver failure.  
 
 
11.2 Expected Acute  Side Effects of Radiation  Therapy 
 
Acute  toxicity  resulting  from radiation therapy  may include  radioepi[INVESTIGATOR_127107],  xerostomia,  thickened  saliva,  hypogeusia,  dysphagia,  hoarseness,  nausea,  emesis,  
skin irritation,  erythema,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_344],  weight  loss, and fatigue.  
11.3 Expected Late Side Effects of Radiation  Therapy 
 
Late toxicity  resulting  from radiation therapy  may include permanent  xerostomia,  hypogeusia,  
dysphagia,  trismus,  nasal  dryness,  serous  otitis media,  dental  decay,  esophageal  constriction,  
permanent  skin changes  including telangiectasias,  hypothyroidism,  ototoxicity  (especially  if 
concurrent  cisplatin  is administered),  and increased risk for secondary  malignancies.  
Osteoradionecrosis  may occur  in 5% or less of patients,  but can be reduced  by [CONTACT_127140],  as per the standard of care.

ensure optimal  supportive care of study  participants.  
11.5 Dose Modifications/  Delays  
 
At the discretion of the treating physician,  any participant  experiencing a grade [ADDRESS_143408] a treatment  break  until resolution  of the toxicity  to grade 1 or less. If grade 3 
toxicity  persists,  requiring  a break  of more  than five consecutive treatments,  the participant   
will be taken off protocol  therapy  per Section 13.0.

Cytopenias  causing dose delays  are not common with every  three week  dosing schedule and 
growth factors  are not used in chemoradiotherapy  protocols.   Neutropenia of less than and 
ANC of 1000  and platelts  of <100  would trigger  a dose delay  and re-assessment  at 1 week.  
In the case  of dose delays,   the final dose of cisplatin  may be given  up to two weeks  after 
completion of radiation therapy.   Elevations  in creatinine  or BUN will be treated with extra 
sessions of intravenous  hydration until the values  normalize.  Should  the creatinine remain 
elevated  between 1.4-1.6 mg/dl  at the time of a subsequent  dose,  than cisplatin  will either  be 
dose reduced  to 75 mg/m2  or discontinued.  The risks of permanent  kidney  damage  with 
additional  cisplatin   will be discussed  with the patient  prior to further  administration.  For 
creatinine levels  >1.6 further  cisplatin  will not be administered.  Interruption  of treatment  may 
occur  due to holidays,  weather  closing  or machines  are down.  
11.6 Adverse Event Reporting 
 
This study  will use the Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  
v4.03  for adverse event  (AE) reporting.  After the Informed Consent  Document  (ICD)  is signed,  
study  site personnel  will record  the occurrence  and nature of each patient’s  pre-existing 
conditions,  including  clinically  significant  signs  and symptoms  of the disease.  During  the  
study,  site personnel  will record any change  in the pre-existing  condition(s),  and the 
occurrence  and nature of any new adverse  events.  
 
Expected  events  during radiation therapy  are: 
• Fatigue/malaise  
• Weakness  
• Nausea  
• Mild anorexia  
• Oral mucositis  
• Radiation  dermatitis  
• Xerostomia 
• Dysphagia  
• Tinnitus  
• Dysgeusia  
 
General  Therapy  Related  Events:  
• Catheter  related events  (thrombosis,  bleeding,  infection)  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127108]:  
• All AEs related to protocol  procedures  are reported.  All AEs occurring  after the patient  
receives  the first dose of radiation therapy  must  be reported in regard  to their 
assessment  of the potential  relatedness  of each  AE to protocol  procedure,  studied 
disease state,  and/or  radiation modality  via CRF.  If a patient’s  radiation treatment  is 
discontinued  as a result  of an AE, personnel  must  clearly  report  the circumstances  
and data leading to any such  dosage reduction  or discontinuation of treatment. 
• Events  leading to the clinical  outcome  of death  due to disease progression will be 
included as part of the safety  and efficacy  analyses  for this study.  
• If a death  is considered related to treatment,  the death should  be reported as a 
Serious  Adverse Event  and appropriate guidelines  followed for SAE reporting.  Any 
clinically  significant  findings  from labs, vital sign measurements,  and other  procedures  
should  be reported as well.

11.7 Definitions of Adverse Events 
 
11.7.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
 
Defined as any harm  or untoward medical  occurrence in a research  participant  who is 
administered  a medical  product,  medical  treatment  or procedure,  even if it does not 
necessarily  have a causal  relationship  with the product,  treatment,  or procedure.  An adverse  
event  can be any unfavorable and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding,  
for example),  symptom,  or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medical  product,  
medical  treatment,  or procedure,  whether  or not considered to be related.  Resources  
containing information  on AEs include monthly  transcripts,  assessment  forms  obtained after 
each clinic  visit, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127109].  Grade  ≥3 adverse  events  other  
than hematologic  toxicities  will be recorded,  graded,  and reported appropriately.  
 
11.7.2  Related  or Possibly  Related AE 
 
An AE is “related or possibly  related to the research  procedures”  if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_127110],  it is more  likely than not caused  by [CONTACT_58864].  AEs that 
are solely  caused by [CONTACT_127141],  disorder,  or condition of the subject,  or by [CONTACT_127142] “related or possibly  related”.  If there is any 
question whether  or not an AE is related or possibly  related,  Grade  3 or higher  AE should be 
reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397]. 
 
11.7.3  Unexpected AE 
 
An AE is “unexpected”  when its nature (specificity),  severity,  or frequenc y are not 
consistent  with (a) the foreseeable risk of adverse events  associated with the research  
procedures  described in protocol -related  documents,  such  as the IRB-approved research 
protocol,  informed consent  document,  product  labeling  and package inserts,  and; (b) the 
characteristics  of the subject  population being studied,  including  the expected natural  
progression of any underlying disease,  disorder  or condition or any predisposing  risk factor  
profile for the adverse event.  AEs that do not meet  the requirement  for expedited reporting will 
be reported to the IRB as part of the annual  renewal  of the protocol.  
 
11.7.[ADDRESS_143409] experience with the research  agent/intervention.  
 
This is recorded using one of the following  four categories:  
• Related  
• Possibly  Related  
• Not Related  
• Unknown 
 
“Related”  events  are those which  are most  certainly  caused  by [CONTACT_127143]. 
“Possibly  related”  events  are those which  may have been  caused  by [CONTACT_127144].  
 
“Not related”  events  are those which  are due to an underlying disease,  disorder,  or condition  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17- 442 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_143410].  
 
“Unknown ” events  are those which  have an unclear  relationship  to the procedures  involved in 
the research,  either  because more  information  is needed,  and will be provided in follow- up, or 
because there  is no way to make  a determination.  
 
11.8 Follo w-up of Adverse Events 
 
All adverse events  will be followed  up according to Good Clinical Practice.  
 
During  Treatment:  Throughout  the duration of the study,  site personnel  will track  any change 
in the condition(s),  the occurrence,  and the nature of any AEs, and record the highest  grade  
of the adverse  event  per cycle  on the CRF.  CTCAE  grading will be assigned before each visit 
for any adverse events  experienced during the previous  visit period.

The cumulative incidence  of locoregional  failure will be recorded from the end of treatment. 
This will be defined  as any progressive disease at the local site or regional/nodal  
(cervical/retropharyngeal)  failure.  If gross  nodes  are treated with radiotherapy,  a 
regional/nodal  failure  will be defined using RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_143412]  of care.

12.5 Disease Specific Mortality  
Disease  specific  mortality  is defined  from the end of treatment  to death from disease.   Deaths  
due to other  causes  will be regarded as competing risks.  
 
12.6 Overall  Survival  
Overall  survival  is defined from the end of treatment  to death from any cause.

13.1 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
If at any time the patient  develops  locally  progressive disease,  s/he will be taken off study  and 
referred  for alternative  therapy.  If at any time the patient  develops  unacceptable  toxicity,  s/he 
will be removed  from the study.  If at any time the patient  dies while  on study,  s/he will be 
removed  from the study.  If grade [ADDRESS_143414] to follow -up (3 months  from 
end of chemoradiation)  is extremely  low as all patients  in our experience will return to see us 
for their first post-treatment  follow -up visit.  If at any time the patient  is found to be ineligible   
for the protocol  as designated in the section  on Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligibility  (i.e. a 
change in diagnosis),  the patient  will be reviewed  and determined whether  to keep on study   
or not at the discretion of the treating physician.  
A patient  has the right to withdraw  from the study  at any time for any reason without  prejudice  
to his/her  future  medical  care by [CONTACT_099],  or at the institution.  Should  a patient  (or a 
patient’s  legally  authorized representative)  decide  to withdraw,  all efforts  will be made  to 
complete and report  the observations  as thoroughly  as possible.   A complete final evaluation 
should be made at the time of the patient’s  withdrawal.  Patients  will be removed  from one or 
more  parts  of the study , at the Investigator’s  discretion,  if one or more  of the following  events  
occur:  
• Significant  noncompliance on the part of the patient  
• Refusal  of the patient  to continue treatment  or observations  
• Decision  by [CONTACT_127145]’s  best medical  interest  
• Patient  is lost to follow -up [ADDRESS_143415] non-surgical  treatment  has a 1-year local failure rate of 40% for SCC 
patients  and 65% for ACC,  Esthesio or Adenocarcinoma  patients.  Therefore,  a mixed  cohort  
of 15 SCC  and 10 ACC/Esthesio/Adenocarcinoma patients  should  have 1-year local failure  
rate of 50% under  standard  non-surgical  treatment4. We expect  to decrease such  a rate to 
25% using the proposed  new treatment.  This design depends  on a one-arm, one-sided  
binomial test and has a decision  rule as follows:  If, among  the total [ADDRESS_143416] 17 patients  who are alive,  followed and local failure free (or equivalently,  at most  
[ADDRESS_143417] local failure)   
one year from the end of the treatment, then we shall declare the proposed  treatment  strategy

be regarded as a local failure.  Patients  who die during treatment  will also be counted  as 
failures,  though  such  a probability  will be small.  This design has a type 1 error rate of 0.05 
and type 2 error rate of 0.15 for testing  the hypothesis  p>=50%  vs p<25%,  where p

To assess  the complications  of minimally  invasive  endoscopic  skull base  surgery  in patients  
with unresectable  disease,  we will use Clavien -Dindo classification  of surgical  complications  
and summarize  the grades  (I-V) and types.  This will be done  after surgery  but before 
radiation.  
 
To assess acute  and long-term toxicity of radiotherapy,  we will summarize  the CTCAE v4.03 
scores  and present  descrptive statistics.  This will be done  weekly  throughout  RT, at the end 
of RT, and then 3 months  after the end of RT for acute toxicities.  Long -term toxicities  will be 
assessed  at 6, 12 and 24 months  after the end of RT. 
 
Patient  reported outcomes  of toxicity  due to radiatherapy,  EORTC(  H&N43  and QLQ C30)

17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
 
• Death  
 
• A life-threatening adverse event  
 
• An adverse event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127112]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct  normal  
life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
 
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127113],  based  upon medical  judgment,  they may 
jeopardize the patient  or participant  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention to 
prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28614] a planned procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered an 
SAE.  
SAE reporting is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention.  SAE reporting is required for 30-days after the participant’s  last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period that is 
unexpected and at least possibly  related to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
Please note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention 
and is related to a screening test or procedure  (i.e., a screening biopsy)  must  be reported.  
All SAEs  must  be submitted in PI[INVESTIGATOR_46427].  If an SAE requires  submission to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  [ADDRESS_143423]  be submitted within  30 calendar  
days of the event.

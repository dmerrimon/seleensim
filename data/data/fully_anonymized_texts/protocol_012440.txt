3.66 new cases per 100,000 people per year in the [LOCATION_002] (1).  The role of adjuvant 
radiation therapy after surgical resection for glioblastoma was established in the 1970s and 1980s through several historic randomized trials comparing radiotherapy to observation (2–4), 
chemotherapy (3–5), or combination therapy  (3–5).  These studies largely showed t hat post -
operative radiotherapy increased the median survival from 3.2- 6.[ADDRESS_300762]-operative radiotherapy 
to include concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy, following a landmark study in 2005 showing the addition of chemotherapy to raise median survival from 12.1 months to 14.6 months (6).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_247355], radiation, and 
chemotherapy, survival outcomes remain poor with most patients progressing within 10- 15 
months and surviving only 14.6- 16.2 months f rom their initial diagnosis (7).  The prognosis for 
patients upon first progression is similarly poor, with most patients only surviving approximately 4 months from progression (8,9) .   
 Re-irradiation is a common treatment component for locally recurrent glioblastoma, often in 
combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy.  Based on a large institutional series of [ADDRESS_300763] regimen for re -irradiation is 35 Gy delivered in 10 fractions over two weeks (10).  Based on 
these data the RTOG is actively testing this regimen in  a prospective randomized study with and 
without concurrent bevacizumab therapy for recurrent glioblastoma (11).  
 The predominant pattern of initial and subsequent failure in glioblastoma is local, with 75 -93% 
of first recurrences occurring within the high -dose volume of radiotherapy (12 –18).  
Accordingly, several prior studies have investigated intensification of local therapy.  In the era before modern chemotherapy, such studies showed improved overall survival with conventionally  fractionated radiation doses to 60 Gy over 45 Gy (19).  However, efforts to dose -
escalate further to 70 Gy (20)  and 80 Gy (21) did not significantly improve survival or patterns 
of failure.  Similarly, randomized studies investig ating intensification of local therapy with 
stereotactic boosting (22)  and brachytherapy (23) showed no improvement in outcomes. 
 Explanations for this paradoxical risk of local recurrence that is refractory to intensive local therapy have included intratumoral hypoxia, genomic and phenoty pic heterogeneity, and 
limitations of current models of radioresistance.  Conventionally “fractionated” radiation schedules are based largely on the linear -quadratic model which is commonly used to estimate 
the probability of tumor control and normal tissue complications  (24).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_247356]  (25,26) , efforts to optimize radiation 
schedules based on the linear -quadratic model have not proven effective in the c linical setting for 
aggressive gliomas  (27) .

Protocol Version Date:  May 21, [ADDRESS_300764] in re -designing radiation schedules , accounting for 
mechanisms of treatment resistance.  Recent work by [CONTACT_247362], M ichor and colleagues has created a 
novel mathematical model of a major mechanism of treatment resistance by [CONTACT_247363] . Specifically, they modeled the evolutionary dynamics of radioresistant, 
slowly proliferating stem- like cell s and radiosensitive, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_247357] .  
They used this model to determine  an optimized radiation fractionation  schedule.  They 
parametrized the mathematical model and validated the predicted  optimal schedules using  a 
genetically engineered  mouse model of PDGF -driven proneural glioblastoma (28,29) . The 
investigators refined their mathematical model and its underlying biological assumptions  through 
an iterative process of mathematical modeling and experimental valida tion.   The mathematical 
model suggested that survival could be prolonged by [CONTACT_247364] -like cells. The model predicted that the stem- like cell fraction could be substantially 
increased by [CONTACT_247365]- induced 
dedifferentiation from differentiated to stem- like cells was maximized.  When the initial predicted 
optimal schedule was tested in a mouse model of PDGF -driven glioblastoma, this model -adapted 
radiation schedule  did, as predicted, significantly increase the stem -like cell fraction and  
significantly improved survival relative to conventionally fractionated radiation among treated 
mice (median survival 50 days vs. 33 days, HR = 0.30, p=0.001) (29).  A second opt imal 
schedule, based on updating the  model to account for time -dependent dedifferentiation from 
differentiated to stem -like cells,  result ed in a further, non- significant,  improvement in survival  
compared with the original optimal schedule  (HR = 0.88, p = 0.18). The updated mathematical 
model fit the experimental data better than the original model.  
 Further evidence from h uman data suggest that enriching the stem -like cell fraction may 
represent a suitable strategy to prolong survival in patients . In a study by P allini and colleagues . 
the stem -like cell fraction was measured at the time of primary surgery and at recurrence, i.e. 
before and after chemo -radiation therapy , in glioblastoma patients  (30).
 The stem -like cell 
enrichment was significantly associated with recurrence- free survival, survival following 
recurrenc e and overall survival.  
 
We have used the validated mathematical model to translate the optimal schedule  used in  the 
mouse experiments  (based on delivering 10 Gy in 5 days)  to humans , using the same toxicity 
constraints and overall treatment time as in the  RTOG 1205 trial . The mathematical model  
predicts  that tumor growth delay is increased by [CONTACT_247366], stem- like cell 
population.  The model  predicts that this is achieved in two ways: by [CONTACT_247367]- like cells.   Ultrafractionation  (three fractions per day)  greatly increases the stem -like cell 
fraction leading to a  slower tumor regrowth following the end of treatment.  However, by 
[CONTACT_247368] -like cells early during treatment the number of radioresistant cells increases 
and, hence, the effectiveness of the remaining fractions of radiation decreases . In addition to 
enriching the stem -like cell population, survival  can be prolonged by [CONTACT_247369].  The total cell number is minimized by [CONTACT_247370].   
Through using the model to simulate different treatment strategies, it is apparent that it is

between fractions for the final t hree treatment days.  
 
Indeed, ultrafractionation has been investigated in glioblastoma with promising results relative to historical controls and no reported grade 3- 4 acute adverse events (31) , emphasizing the promise 
and safety of this approach.  We hypothesize that this novel, model -based radiation fractionation scheme will be safe and 
deliverable for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. This study will use  the previously derived 
mathe matical model to optimize a commonly used 2 -week dose -fractionation scheme for re -
irradiation in glioblastoma (2), currently the standard re -irradiation regimen of the Radiation 
Therapy Oncology Group (11) .

REGISTRATION PROCEDU RES  
 5.1 
General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions  
 Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins w ill be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
 An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 Following registration, participants may begin proto col therapy. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s registration on the study must be canceled.  Registration cancellations must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.

by [CONTACT_111527] 1205 (35 Gy in 10 fractions) as a standard (11) , this protocol has re -optimized 
the radiation schedule .  Radiation therapy will be delivered in 2 phases over 2 weeks with 
fractions delivered on Monday through Friday only ( with no treatments  on Saturday or 
Sunday ).  All patients will aim to have their first fraction on Monday of week 1. In phase 
1, participants will receive [ADDRESS_300772] for clinical or 
logistical reasons (i.e. scheduled department closure for holiday)  in which case treatment 
will not be administered on a given day over the 2 -week course, an alternative treatment 
schedule will be generated utilizing the prediction model for the missing fraction(s).  A separate sensitivity analysis was conducted and predicted for a similar benefit of the novel schedule over standard re -irradiation schedule, irrespective of which day of the 
week treatment is started, as  shown in Figure 1b.

6.1.3 Norma l Tissue Constraints : Participants  shall receive prescription doses to the PTV (with 
the above constraints). All attempts should be made to deliver the PTV dose with the above heterogeneity constraints with adherence to critical structure dose constraints .  
The 
normal tissue dose constraints are designed to be equivalent in terms of biologically 
effective dose (BED), to those used in the RTOG 1205 trial. The BED is defined as:  
 
 
 
where n is the number of fractions and d is the dose per fraction. For centra l nervous 
system toxicity an alpha/beta ration of 2 was used. The MARS -Glio dose constraints for

See Section 6.5 below for specifics regarding when to implement a dose reduction. The final prescription dose will be reported specifically to the study coordinator and recorded on a patient -by-patient basis.  
 6.2 
Technical Factors  
 6.2.1 RT will be delivered with megavolt age equipment at energies ≥6 MV .  Any FDA cleared 
external beam radiation delivery system may be used (including conventional linear accelerators ).  All treatment fractions (as specified above in Table 1) will be delivered on 
consecutive treatment days .  All patients will be positioned via a combination of rigid 
immobilization and daily image guidance to ensure positioning accuracy of 3 mm or better, and of a magnitude that justifies the PTV margin applied (the treating radiation oncologist must document the immobilization an d localization methods applied) . 
 
6.[ADDRESS_300773] - and/or MRI -based (if available) in all cases. The use of contrast at 
the time of simulation is not required.  Participants  will b e positioned on a flat tabletop 
with a customized immobilization for stabilization and setup reproducibility , with the 
patient in the same position and immobilization device as for treatment.  CT images should be acquired at a slice thickness of ≤3 mm.  Target volumes (Section 6.4.1) and 
normal critical structures (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be defined in the slices in which they are visualized.  
 6.4 
Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
 6.4.1 The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the ICRU Report #50: Prescri bing, 
Recording, and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-105 
Protocol Version Date:  May 21, 2019 
 
 Page 20 [IP_ADDRESS] The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined will be defined using a CT and/or 
contrast -enhanced MRI (obtained prior to the initiation  of re -irradiation).   If no 
residual enhancing tumor is noted, t he post -operative resection cavity will be 
outlined. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is the GTV plus areas considered to contain microscopic disease.  A CTV expansion of no more than [ADDRESS_300774] 
be reported when used.  Otherwise, no CTV expansion is expressly recommended.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] The Planning Target Volume (PTV) will provide a margin around the CTV to compensate for the variability of treatment set up and internal organ motion. A range of 1- 5 mm around the CTV is required to define each respective PTV. As noted above 
in Section 6.3.1, daily image guidance to ensure positioning accuracy of 3 mm or better . 
 [IP_ADDRESS] The ICRU Reference Points are to be located in the central part of th e PTV and, 
secondly, on or near the central axis of the beams. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_247359].  
 [IP_ADDRESS] The PTV forms the entire target as described. 3D -conformal, intensity modulated 
radiation the rapy (IMRT) , Volumetric Arc Therapy  (VMAT) , and/or  fractionated 
stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) are all acceptable modalities of radiation treatment delivery.  If IMRT or SRT are intended, to avoid delays resulting from unplanned equipment availability, ph oton therapy may be administered using 3D -conformal 
radiotherapy at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  
 
6.5 
Critical Structures  
 
Critical structure dose constraints shall remain consistent with Tables  7-9 above . While 
every effort should be made to  deliver prescription doses to the PTV as specified while 
adhering to these constraints, it is  recognized that certain anat omical factors may prevent 
this. 
 For purposes of compliance, up to a 5% absolute increase  in the volume of critical 
structure  receiving greater than the specified dose will be considered  “variation 
acceptable,” without a  protocol deviation. Any increase in critical structure volume 
greater than 5% receiving more than  the specified dose will be considered a “ deviation 
unacceptabl e.”  It is at this point that a dose  reduction should be considered .

DRUG THERAPY  
 This protocol does not specify any investigational drug therapy.  Participants  receiving re-
irradiation may not receive c oncurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy  (i.e. temozolomide, CCNU, 
vincristine, procarbazine) or concurrent immunotherapy (i.e. pembrolizumab, nivolumab) .  
Participants may receive sequential systemic therapy before or after radiation without limitation.   
Partici pants may receive concurrent corticosteroid and/or anti -angiogenic therapy (i.e. 
bevacizumab) if clinically indicated.   
  8. 
SURGERY   
 This protocol does not mandate neurosurgical resection prior to receipt of re -irradiation.  
Participants may undergo a plan ned neurosurgical resection prior to registration and receipt of 
re-irradiation at the discretion of the treatment multidisciplinary team.  Such participants will be 
required to have recovered from the acute effects of neurosurgery prior to initiating re -irradiation 
at the judgment of the treating radiation oncologist.  There is no maximum or minimum interval from the time of prior surgery to initiation of re -irradiation.  If participants underwent a 
preceding neurosurgical resection, the target volume for re -irradiation will include the surgical 
cavity plus any residual enhancing disease.

The length of follow up for the primary outcome measure (feasibility of receipt of fractions)  will 
be 1 month after treatment completion.  The length of follow up for all other endpoints will be 
until death or loss to follow up.  This is because the usual clinical care for patients with brain 
metastases involves a radiation or neuro- oncology visit, history, and an MRI brain every 2- 6 
months until death or other loss to follow up.

STATI STICAL CONSIDERATION S 
 12.1 
Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoint  
The primary outcome measure  is the feasibility of delivering a model- adapted radiation 
fractionation schedule . Feasibility is defined as successful completion of radiation therapy for  at 
least [ADDRESS_300785] on tumor kill from the timing of once daily radiotherapy.  This analysis did reveal the importance of the timing of three -times daily radiation therapy, for which feasibility 
was defin ed as treatment within 1 hour of the scheduled time.  
 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary outcomes and analytic techniques  to assess these outcomes will include: 
1. Quality of life, as determined by [CONTACT_224957] -BT index (Appendix B), ascertained at the time 
of study  enrollment, [ADDRESS_300786] a longitudinal / repeated measures analysis to assess quality of life (mean MDASI -BT score for items 1 -22 in APPENDIX B between 0 -24 weeks)  
2. Incidence ( exact binomial distribution with 95% confidence interval s) 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-105 
Protocol Version Date:  May 21, 2019 
 
 Page 27 and time to the development of Grade 3+ acute or delayed CNS toxicity  
3. Incidence and time to development of radiation necrosis (Kaplan- Meier plot, Cox regression)  
4. Incidence and time to the developme nt of seizures (Kaplan -Meier plot, Cox regression)  
5. Performance status (longitudinal regression)  
6. Overall survival , defined as the interval from registration to death from any cause  (Kaplan -
Meier plot, Cox regression ) 
7. Progression- free survival , defined as the interval from registration to progression or death, 
whichever occurs first  (Kaplan -Meier plot, Cox regression)  
8. Local recurrence, defined as the interval from registration to local recurrence (Kaplan -Meier 
plot)  
9. Incidence and time to salvage craniotomy (K aplan -Meier plot, Cox regression)  
10. Incidence and time to additional systemic treatments after reirradiation  (Kaplan -Meier plot)  
 
12.2 Sample Size and Power Justification  
 The final target accrual for this study will be 1 4 cases . 
 
A recent trial attempted to deliver  90 fractions of radiation therapy to glioblastoma patients in 6 
to 7 weeks, 5 days per week, 3 fractions per day  (32) . The schedule  was successfully 
administered in 22/27 (81%) patients who started radiation therapy. The one -sided 95% upper 
limit (exact binomial  distribution) for the population non- adherence was, therefore, 3 5%. Based 
on this adherence rate delivery of the schedule was deemed feasible.  
 The schedule proposed in this protocol is substantially simpler  to deliver. If 13 out of 14 patients 
are able to complete the proposed schedule  (86%) , this study would demonstrate that the one -
sided 95% upper limit (exact binomial distribution ) for the population non -adherence is 30% . 
This non- adherence rate, or lower, w ould be deemed acceptable to progress to a subsequent 
efficacy trial. If all patients  are able to complete the proposed schedule, this study would 
demonstrate that the one -sided 95% upper limit for the population non- adherence is no higher 
than 20% . 
 12.[ADDRESS_300787] 6 months.  If the average accrual over two months (6 months after trial activation) is less than [ADDRESS_300788] to feasibility.  
 The study duration will be approximately 28 months; [ADDRESS_300789] participant enr olled.  
Accrual should be well -balanced for males, females, and minorities.

Complete response (CR). All of the following criteria must be met:  
o Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non -measur able disease 
sustained for at least [ADDRESS_300790] be on no steroids or on physiologic replacement doses only.  
o Stable or improved non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions. 
o Stable or improved clinically, for clinical signs and symptoms present at baseline and recorded to be disease related.  
Participants with non- measurable disease cannot have a complete response. The best 
response possible is stable disease.  
 
Partial response (PR). All of the following criteria must be met:  
o ≥50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least [ADDRESS_300791] be assessed using the same 
techniques as baseline.  
o The steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the 
dose at time of baseline scan.  
o Stable or improved non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared to baseline scan.  
o Stable or improved, for clinical signs and symptoms present at baseline and recorded to be disease related clinically.  
Partic ipants with non- measurable disease cannot have a partial response. The best 
response possible is stable disease.  
 
Progressive disease (PD). The following criterion must be met : 
> 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (over best response or baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids and/or one or more of the of the following:  
o Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non- enhancing lesion on stable or increasing 
doses of corticosteroids steroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy not due to co -morbid events (radiation therapy, 
demyelination, ischemic injury,infection, seizures, post -operative changes, or 
other treatment effects).  
o Any new lesion

 Page 30 o Clear cli nical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor 
(e.g. seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular 
events, infection, etc.). The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the  investigator but it is recommended that a decline in the 
Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) from [ADDRESS_300792] 7 days, be consider ed neurologic deterioration, unless attributable 
to comorbid events or changes in corticosteroid dose. 
o Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition  
o NOTE: If there is uncertainty whether the patient has progressed it is permissi ble 
to repeat the scan in 1 month. If that scan confirms progression, the date of progression will be the original date when progression was suspected to deal with ambiguities related to pseudoprogression.  
 Stable disease (SD). All of the following criter ia must be met : 
o Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression. 
o All measurable and non- measurable sites must be assessed using the same 
techniques as baseline.  
o Stable non- enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared to baseli ne scan. In the event that the corticosteroid dose 
has been increased, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose. 
o Stable clinically.

Reporting and Exclusions  
 Participants who never start protocol therapy will be conside red “inevaluable” and will be 
excluded from analysis of all endpoints.  In terms of grade 3+ toxicity and acute/delayed toxicity, 
all patients receiving any or partial protocol treatment should be included. 
 
12.8.[ADDRESS_300793] treatment. Toxicity 
endpoints will be reported separately for participants who complete all prescribed radiotherapy per protocol and for those who do not.  We will monitor for the following:  Fatigue  
 Fatigue is common after brain radiation; it is less common and typi[INVESTIGATOR_107899]- lived after shorter 
courses of radiation but can still occur.  
 Nausea  
Nausea may occur with re- irradiation although typi[INVESTIGATOR_247360].  
 Headache Headache that occurs with re- irradiation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_229766].  
 Symptomatic edema  
Symptomatic edema occurs when radiation interacts with the tumor, leading to death of tumor cells and resulting inflammation. It may be more common with re -radiation.  
 Seizure  
Seizures are uncommon in patients receiving fractioned radiation but may be more common among patients receiving re -irradiation.  Seizures generally do not stem from infratentorial 
lesions, however.  
 Intracranial hemorrhage Intracranial hemorrhage has never been definiti vely associated with radiation, although patients 
with glioblastoma may have a propensity to bleed and may display hemorrhage post radiation, especially if patients are on anticoagulation for other reasons. Intratumoral hemorrhage will

DF/HCC Protocol #: 18-105 
Protocol Version Date:  May 21, 2019 
 
 Page 32 require only close m onitoring with MRI. Extratumoral hemorrhage may require referral to 
Neuro -oncology, admission, a treatment break, and possible discontinuation of agents that 
predispose to bleeding, depending on the nature and severity of the bleed.  
 
Radiation necrosis  
Radiation necrosis can occur after re- irradiation. Enhancing lesions that increase in size after 
radiation will be evaluated for the possibility of radiation necrosis using a dual -phase PET scan, 
at the discretion of the primary investigator and the treating neuro -oncologists.  Asymptomatic 
radiation necrosis will be monitored on brain MRI. Symptomatic necrosis will initially be managed with a brief (e.g. three week) course of dexamethasone.  If refractory, referral to Neuro -
oncology for consideration of bevac izumab and neurosurgery for consideration of resection will 
be arranged.  
 
12.8.2 Evaluation of the Primary and Secondary Endpoint s
 
 All participants who initiate radiotherapy on protocol will be considered “evaluable” and will be included in analyses for feasibil ity.   
 Survival, progression- free survival, and quality of life endpoints will be reported separately for 
participants who complete all prescribed radiotherapy per protocol and for those who do not.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 13.1 
Data Safety Monitoring 
 The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity 
and accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Inform ation that 
raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  
 The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to review toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up -to-date 
participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade [ADDRESS_300794] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring with 30 days of intervention for Phase I or II protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow -up; any response information; audit results, and a 
summary provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) w ill be 
provided upon request.    14.

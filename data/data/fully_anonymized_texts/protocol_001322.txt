even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics 
(antimicrobials used to treat bacterial infections).1,2 The binary issue is that 
when antibiotics are prescribed appropriately to treat bacterial infec tion, 
they are effective and should be prescribed without delay. However, 50% of 
the time antibiotics are misused or prescribed without proper indication.  
 
Lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (LRTI) are among the most frequent 
indications for antibiotics and pose a significant risk for excess ive exposure 
to antibiotics and increase incidence of CDI. Delay or lack of pathog en 
identification and non-specific clinical and radiographic findings often leave  
clinicians with insufficient evidence to make definitive decisions reg arding 
the need for antibiotics.  The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDS A) 
recommends improving antibiotic prescribing practices as an essential 
action. [ADDRESS_785998] been proposed as a complementary strategy 
to evaluate the severity of bacterial infection, differentiate viral fr om 
bacterial etiologies, and improve antibiotic therapy decisions.  Pro calcitonin 
(PCT), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is nearly undetectable in health and 
up regulated in response to endotoxemia, offers significantly more sensitive 
and specific prediction of bacterial infection. Trials comparing  PCT-guided 
antibiotic algorithms to standard management show a significant reduction 
in antibiotic exposure without an increase in mortality or treatment failure.

Statistical Methodology For the primary study endpoint " short antibiotic treatments” ( proportion of 
patients with short antibiotic treatment of pneumonia less than 4  days, 
“shortABx”)  the hypotheses for statistical inference are as follows: 
H0: The probability of patients with short antibiotic treatments of 
pneumonia is smaller or equal in the PCT arm versus the control arm. 
H1: The probability of patients with short antibiotic treatments of  
pneumonia is greater in the PCT arm than in the control arm.

30” (“ CAE30 ”) the hypotheses for statistical inference are as follows: 
H0: PCT arm is inferior to control arm   in composite safety adverse event 
rate at day 30. 
H1: PCT arm is not inferior to control arm in composite saf ety adverse event 
rate at day 30. 
For the second secondary study endpoint "proportion of patients with 
antibiotic exposure at discharge ”) (“prescribedABx ”) the hypotheses for 
statistical inference are as follows: 
H0: The probability of patients with antibiotic exposure at discharge i s 
greater or equal in the PCT arm versus the control arm. 
H1: The probability of patients with short antibiotic treatment of pn eumonia 
is smaller in the PCT arm than in the control arm. 
 
The analysis of the study endpoint s shortABx, CAE30 and 
prescribedABx will be conducted with Bayesian methodology: Differences 
in proportions between study arms will be assessed on the basis 
of posterior probabilities assuming binomially distributed events and 
uninformative uniform priors. Type-1 error is controlled at 2.5% .  
The endpoints shortABx and prescribedABx will be tested for superiority . 
Superiority is specified by [CONTACT_726] 98.5% [ADDRESS_786004] on antibiotic reduction, adver Se events and AVoidable healthcar E costs (ProSAVE): A RCT

[ADDRESS_786005] arm versus the control arm 
(shortABx) and less frequent antibiotic exposure at discharge in the PCT 
arm versus the control arm (prescribedABx). 
The endpoint CAE30 will be tested for non-inferiority. Non-inferiori ty is 
specified by 98.5% [ADDRESS_786006] arm than the CAE30 probability of patients of the 
control arm plus 10% non-inferiority ( NI) margin.  
 
For further secondary and exploratory endpoints: 
Distributions of numerical variables will be visualized for all patien ts and 
separately for PCT and control arm. Study arm-specific distributions w ill be 
compared with each other by [CONTACT_158092] (e.g. Wilcoxon rank-sum  tests), 
and by [CONTACT_595395] (e.g. group medians and 
means). 
2 x 2 contingency tables will be reported for counts stratified acc ording to 
study arm (PCT, control) and endpoint level (true/false). Associatio ns 
between study arms and endpoints will be analyzed by [CONTACT_158092] (e.g. 
chi-square test or Fisher’s exa ct test). Proportions and two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals or Bayesian 95% credible intervals  will be computed for 
all patients and separately for PCT and control arm. 
 
Health Economic Evaluation: 
The clinical outcomes of the study will be analyzed from a health economic 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595349], extrapolation to third party payer remains optional. 
Clinical data and local cost data will be processed in the previously 
published/under publication Health Economic Model (Janne C Mewes et. 
al., The cost impact of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship versus usual  care 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595350]: a health economic model analysis). All available 
information will be used in the model. Missing/confidential cost data  will be 
substituted with publicly available data and highlighted accordingly. 
All findings will be discussed in the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595351].

[ADDRESS_786009] e types or classes of 
antibiotics (antimicrobials used to treat bacterial infections).1,2 The binary issue is that when antibiotics 
are prescribed appropriately to treat bacterial infection, they are effective  and should be prescribed 
without delay. However, 50% of the time antibiotics are misused or prescri bed without proper indication.  
 
Lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (LRTI) are among the most frequent i ndications for antibiotics and pose 
a significant risk for excessive exposure to antibiotics and increase i ncidence of CDI. Delay or lack of 
pathogen identification and non-specific clinical and radiographic findi ngs often leave clinicians with 
insufficient evidence to make definitive decisions regarding the need for anti biotics.  The Infectious 
Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends improving antibiotic prescribing practices as an essential 
action. [ADDRESS_786010] been proposed as a complementary strategy to evaluate the severity of 
bacterial infection, differentiate viral from bacterial etiologies, and improve  antibiotic therapy decisions.  
Procalcitonin (PCT), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is nearly undetectable in heal th and up regulated 
in response to endotoxemia, offers significantly more sensitive and specific predic tion of bacterial 
infection. Trials comparing PCT-guided antibiotic algorithms to standa rd management show a significant 
reduction in antibiotic exposure without an increase in mortality or treatment failur e 4,5,6.

The secondary study endpoints are as follows: 
 
1. Safety non-inferiority  endpoint: Composite safety adverse event rate at 30 days (CAE30). The 
composite endpoint includes: 
a. All-cause in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] 
b. All-cause mortality after discharge (as available) 
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715]  
d. Septic shock (vasopressor use for > 1 h) 
e. Mechanical ventilation (via endotracheal tube for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) 
f. Required dialysis 
g. Lung abscess/empyema/cavitation/necrotizing pneumonia 
 
In the case a patient is enrolled with mechanical ventilation, such an event  is not considered to be an 
adverse event due to its occurrence before randomization. If the patient is  then extubated during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], re-intubation is only classified as an adverse event if it occurs at least [ADDRESS_786012] 
randomization, such an event will be classified as an adverse event. 
 
2. Antibiotic exposure at discharge (superiority endpoint) 
3. Days of Therapy per 1000 patient days (inclusive of antibiotics prescribed at discharg e) 
4. LOS in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595346] 30 
5. LOS on ICU until Day 30 
6. ICU admission until Day 30

 Study Design 
The study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized controlled, multicenter, interventi onal 
trial whereby [CONTACT_595398]: 
PROcalcitonin impact on antibiotic reduction, adver Se events and AVoidable healthcar E costs (ProSAVE): A RCT  
Clinicaltrials .gov Identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]                                                                                                                                  
23 
 (i) Antibiotic prescription guided by a PCT algorithm and  stewardship team  (PCT arm): 
antibiotic treatment recommendations will be made by [CONTACT_595399]. The 
stewardship team will discuss PCT algorithm overruling with the primary care team .  
(ii) antibiotic prescription guided by [CONTACT_148188]  (control arm): treating clinicians 
will be blinded to PCT results and antibiotic treatment decisions wi ll be at the 
discretion of the treating clinician based on standard of care guidelines.  
Antibiotic exposure (duration and DOT), safety outcomes and associated healthc are costs will be 
compared between groups throughout enrollment and follow up.   
Screening, (D0) Baseline and (D1) PCT measurement 
Patients will be consecutively screened for eligibility one day after their  admission to an inpatient 
bed. Research staff will be responsible for screening admissions and antibi otic orders for potential 
enrollment and randomization. A dedicated stewardship team at each site will i mplement the 
intervention algorithm. The stewardship team will ensure PCT results and ap propriate algorithm 
interventions are addressed (via phone, email, messaging system, or in person) with t he primary 
provider as well as document assigned protocol adherence and deviations. 
 
Upon review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, study subjects will be ra ndomized 1:1 into one of two 
groups: (i) PCT algorithm + stewardship team arm or (ii) the standa rd care arm. PCT results will be 
unblinded  in the (i) PCT algorithm + stewardship team arm  and blinded in the (ii) standard care 
group .  
 
Potential subjects resulting from the initial EPIC screen are not considered subjects. Subjects are 
defined as those who meet criteria for entry into the study. Non-elig ible subjects are those who 
have met an exclusion criterion at some point during the study.  
 
Upon randomization, the research staff will send a welcome message to bo th the standard of care 
and intervention teams. Enrollment PCT values consist of one value from t he day of randomization 
(D1) and one value from a previous day 6-48 hours prior (D0). All PCT measurements thr oughout 
the study should be obtained using discarded blood from routine lab work. All  PCT values ordered 
by [CONTACT_595400], while those of the 
standard of care arm will be suppressed.  
 
After the PCT results are available, the stewardship team will review bot h the D0 and D1 results 
as a pair and provide an antibiotic recommendation (PCT intervention arm  only) using the 
stewardship team recommendation template  to the primary provider service on enrollment day. 
If the stewardship team is discordant with the PCT algorithm (see section 1.5 for al gorithm), they 
will be sent a discordance survey (see Appendix G). I f the primary team is discordant with the 
stewardship recommendations, a reason for discordance survey will be sent out  and recorded in 
REDCap (see Appendix H). Patient information will be recorded in REDCap fo r both the 
intervention and standard of care arms.

[ADDRESS_786013] r esults and provide an 
antibiotic recommendation to the primary provider service on the same calenda r day . Antibiotic 
monitoring and/or discontinuation will be guided by [CONTACT_13113] (m edical history, physical 
exam, imaging and standard laboratory evaluations) as well as the PCT algo rithm (Appendix A, 
LRTI) and pre-defined overruling criteria (Appendix A, 11.2). If the s tewardship team is discordant 
with the PCT algorithm, a discordance survey will be requested (Appendix G). In case of 
discordance between the primary team and the stewardship team, a discordance survey will also 
be requested (Appendix H). 
 
The stewardship team will provide a recommendation every day (Monday-Frid ay) that the patient 
has a PCT result. Patients will not receive recommendations on weekends, holidays or pre-
planned absences . If the stewardship team wants to repeat the same recommendation for 
multiple days in a row, they must indicate in their communication t o the team that this is a 
standing recommendation and the medical team will not receive further comm unications until 
the stewardship team decides to change their recommendation. If the medical team  changes, the 
new medical team will receive a recommendation.  
 
In both arms, selection of antibiotic agent, dosing and route of adm inistration will be at the 
discretion of the treating clinician. 
 
For patients in the control arm,  PCT results will be blinded to  the stewardship and primary service 
team . Select research staff will be unblinded to the PCT values and will record them into REDCap . 
Antibiotic monitoring and/or discontinuation will be guided by [CONTACT_595401] (medical history, physical exam, and imaging and standard l aboratory 
evaluations).

to the (i) PCT algorithm + stewardship team arm or (ii) the standard care arm .  
 
 Procalcitonin (PCT) Measurement  
Procalcitonin will be measured with the Elecsys B·R·A·H·M·S PCT ™ assay or Abbott Alinity and site 
personnel will be responsible for PCT measurements according to standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595360].  
 
PCT results will be unblinded in the PCT arm (i.e. antibiotic management guided by [CONTACT_595404] + stewardship team ) and blinded in the control arm  (i.e. antibiotic management guided 
by [CONTACT_9518] ). Research staff will enter PCT results in the eCRF (REDCap ) and also ensure 
that the stewardship team views the results and makes a recommendation for PCT arm patients 
at the time frames specified in section 4.[ADDRESS_786017] an SOP or delegation log with all key personnel lis ted including the core lab 
director/manager who will have confirmed that their site has PCT testing vali dated and ready for 
use.   
 
If during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779], patients meet an enrollment ineligibility criterion (e.g ., developed a 
non- pulmonary infection, had to undergo a major surgery…), PCT levels will stop being measured 
and no further intervention from the stewardship team will be made. How ever, patients will 
continue to be monitored.  
7 STUDY DATA 
Data from the participating patients will be collected in electroni c Case Report Forms (“CRF”) ( see 9.4 
Case Report Form). These clinical parameters will be collected to determ ine the clinical status of the 
patients.  
 Clinical Data Collection 
The following clinical parameters will be collected in the corresponding eCRFs :  
• Socio-demographics at baseline PCT measurement  D0 only (age, gender, race, weight) 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595361] (Enrollment date, time, number of days in the ICU, number of days in 
the general ward, number of mechanical ventilation days; admission date, time, diagnosis; 
discharge date, time diagnosis; ICU admission, date, time, reason for ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517]) 
• Medical History (history of present illness, list of chronic conditions) 
• Clinical Assessment  (date, time, physical exam, chief complaint, suspected site of infection, 
PSI, CURB 65 score)

• Imaging Results for each image ordered while enrolle d (Chest radiograph, Chest CT: Date, 
time, results summary) 
• Laboratory Values included in the standard care of a  patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595362], daily as available (date, time of blood draw; Complete Blood Count (CBC), serum 
creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and serum total 
bilirubin, C-reactive Protein (CRP), lactate, # of blood cultures taken per patient, blood and 
sputum culture results (date/time, infecting pathogen), urine legionella  and/or urine 
pneumococcus (if available), Procalcitonin (PCT)) 
• Antibiotic Therapy (agent, dosing, date and time at start and stop). More specifically, each 
agent will be documented daily as being started, continued or stopped including dat e and 
time of start and stop. 
• Antibiotic Therapy Decision Rationale at start/stop  (reasons for starting, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_6926]/or not 
starting new therapy (drop down: PCT Algorithm + clinical status, impro ving clinical status, 
worsening signs and symptoms, clinical assessment did not match PCT algorithm, other  (free 
text)). 
• Presence of pre-defined overruling criteria  (indicated according to Appendix A, 11.2 )  
• Reason if recommendation from stewardship team is ov erruled  (Clinician gave antibiotics 
before recommendation was available; Clinician believes bacterial infectio n present; Clinician 
unfamiliar/uncomfortable/disagrees with PCT value; Attending physician o verruled; Patient
’s clinical condition is worsening/severely ill ; Borderline PCT result ; Patient 
expectations/satisfaction required antibiotics ; COPD exacerbation/flare for anti-
inflammatory properties (particularly for azithromycin);  Meets guideline criteria for ABX in 
COPD flare ;  Other, free text)) 
• Antibiograms – antibiotic susceptibility will be collected to determine evolutio n of multi-drug 
resistant flora.

Plan (SAP). 
 Study Design 
8.1.[ADDRESS_786018] algorithm applied to non- COVID-19 patients 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595364] 
1. reduces antibiotic exposure specified as an increase of short  antibiotic pneumonia treatments 
lasting less than 4 days, 
2. is not inferior concerning safety according to composite adverse events until day 30 , and  
3. reduces antibiotic exposure specified as a decrease of antibiotics prescribed at di scharge for 
pneumonia treatment. 
 
8.1.3 Randomization  
Patients will be randomized with equal 50% probability to the two treatment arms “PCT  arm ” and 
“control  arm ”, see Section 6.  Block randomization per study site will be applied, with random block 
length in order to prevent the possibility of predicting study arm assignments.   
 
 Mathematical Definitions 
8.2.1 Short antibiotic treatments (“shortABx ”, primary endpoint)   
will be encoded as the proportion of patients per study arm (PCT arm, control arm) w ith less than 4 
days of antibiotic duration  
“antibiotic duration”  (third secondary endpoint) is defined as the number of days per patient with 
antibiotic treatment for pneumonia comprising the number of days of antibiotic treat ment during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (“ABx -days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ”, starting with the first day of PCT measurement which is one day

 before enrollment into the study, counting all days with antibiotics not marked “not us ed for 
pneumonia”) and the number of prescribed days of antibiotic treatment at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] 
(“ABx -days prescribed at discharge ”, counting all days with antibiotics marked “to treat pneumonia”). The 
resulting sum will be bounded up to a maximum follow-up time of 30 days: 
Antibiotic duration = min( 30, ABx-days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  + ABx-days prescribed at discharge ) 
8.2.[ADDRESS_786019] secondary endpoint  "composite adverse events until day 30 ” (“CAE30 ”)  
will be encoded as the patient level  Boolean inclusive disjunction (“OR”) of the following eight binary 
(true/false) single adverse event endpoints (1a) all-cause in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595365] y, (1b) all-cause mortality 
after discharge (as available), (2) septic shock (vasopressor use for > 1 h), (3) mechani cal ventilation (via 
endotracheal tube), (4) needed dialysis, (5) lung abscess/empyema or (6 ) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  
 
The variable CAE [ADDRESS_786020], the endpoint will be analyzed in the form of study-arm-specific proport ions, see Section 8.6. 
 
8.2.3 The second secondary endpoint “ antibiotic exposure at discharge ” (“prescribedABx ”)  
will be encoded as the proportion of patients per study arm (PCT arm, control arm ) with antibiotic 
prescription for pneumonia treatment at discharge from index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  
8.2.[ADDRESS_786021] secondary endpoint  “antibiotic duration ” 
will be computed per patient as described in Subsection 8.2.2. 
8.2.5 The fourth secondary endpoint “days of therapy per 1000 patient days ”  
will be computed per patient i as follows (i: index distinguishing different study pati ents): 
 
     DoT( patient i ) = antibiotic  duration( patient i ) / los30( patient i ) x 1000 
 
with length of stay of patient i  
 
     los30( patient i ) = min( 30, number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595366] i ). 
 
Note that DoT( patient i ) is not capped by 1000 because antibiotic  duration also includes antibiotics 
days prescribed at discharge while los 30 only counts the number of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598]. 
 
8.2.6 The fifth secondary endpoint “antibiotic days prescribed at discharge ” 
will be computed per patient as the number of prescribed days of antibiotic treatment at hospi [INVESTIGATOR_595367] “to treat pneumonia”.   
 
8.2.7 The sixth secondary endpoint  “treatment or readmission for CDI until day 30 after 
enrollment ” 
will be encoded in binary Boolean form (“true”: patient treated or re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595368] 30 
after enrollment , otherwise “false”).

32 
  
8.2.8 The seventh secondary endpoint “length of stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595369] 30 ” (“los30”)  
will be computed per patient as described in the previous subsection. 
 
8.2.9 The eighth secondary endpoint “ length of stay in ICU ” (“losICU30”)  
will be computed analogously to los30 but will only count days on ICU: 
 
     losICU30 = min(30, number of ICU days of patient i ). 
 
8.2.10 The ninth secondary endpoint “ ICU admission until day 30 ”  
will be encoded per patient in binary form (“true”: patient admitted to ICU within stud y follow -up time 
of 30 days, otherwise “false”).  
 
8.2.11 Exploratory Endpoints 
All the  individual variables constituting the composite safety endpoint “ composite adverse events until 
day 30 ” will be considered as exploratory endpoints and be encoded in Boolean-binary form (true/false).  
 
 Primary Study Hypothesis 
 
For the primary study endpoint “short antibiotic treatments ” (“shortABx” ; proportion of patients with 
short antibiotic treatments of pneumonia less than 4 days) the study hypo theses for statistical inference 
are as follows: 
 
H0: The probability of patients with short antibiotic treatment of pneumonia is smal ler or equal in the 
PCT arm versus the control arm. 
 
H1: The probability of patients with short antibiotic treatment of pneumonia is gr eater in the PCT arm 
than in the control arm. 
 
Note that t he study goal is one-sided: to validate a shortABx probability in the PCT arm that is higher 
than the shortABx probability in the control arm (see Section 8.6 and 8. 9; one-sided statistical testing at 
2.5% significance level controlled for multiple testing / interim analyses. Bayesi an statistics with 
uninformative priors will be applied for analysis (see Section 8.6.2).  
 
 Analysis Populations 
The intention -to-treat (“ ITT”) patient population will comprise all randomized non-COVID- 19 patients.  
The p er-protocol (“PP”) patient population will comprise all  ITT patients  
(a) fulfilling study inclusion criteria,  
(b) not meeting study exclusion criteria at enrollment,  
(c) even if meeting study exclusion criterion after enrollment or meeting a pre -defined overruling 
criterion,

during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595370],  
(e) if assigned to PCT group, antibiotic steward ship team recommendation given to the t reating 
physician on enrollment day and for each PCT measurement taken Monday-Friday described under d) 
and antibiotics stopped  according to the PCT algorithm. An exception will be made if the stewardship 
team decides the patient will be given the same recommendation throughout their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094].  
 
Consequently, it should be noted that stewardship team recommendations should also be provided fo r 
patients meeting pre-defined overruling criteria (e.g., need for ICU care) since such p atients may still 
qualify for the per-protocol population. 
 
Patients of the PCT arm who are discharged before that day’s  PCT has resulted will be excluded from the 
per protocol population. Patients in the PCT arm who were continued on antibiot ics despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 
weekend/holiday/no stewardship team member available PCT value that would have resulted in an 
stewardship team recommendation to stop antibiotics will also be excluded fro m the per protocol 
population. Patients in the PCT arm who se antibiotics were discontinued despi[INVESTIGATOR_595371]/holiday/no 
stewardship team member available PCT value that would have resulted in continuatio n of antibiotics 
will also be excluded. 
 
(f) if assigned to control group, no PCT measurements to treating physician duri ng index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
Primary analysis of the superiority endpoint “antibiotic exposure” will be conducted on the basis of the 
ITT patient population. Analysis of the non- inferiority endpoint “composite adverse events until day 30” 
will be conducted on the basis of PP and ITT patient population. PP-results will be compared and 
discussed with corresponding results obtained for ITT patient population.  
 
 Handling of Missing Data 
Complete case  analysis will be conducted as long as the fraction of missing values for “composite  
adverse events until day 30 ” and “antibiotic exposure”  (“short antibiotic treatments” and “antibiotic 
exposure at discharge ”) remain in the range of up to 5%. If the number of missing values turns out to be 
above 5%, an additional analysis will be conducted using multiple or Bayesian imputation . In any case, 
the possible impact of missing values on study results will be assessed by [CONTACT_595405]-case and best-case imputations.

[ADDRESS_786023]. 
 
8.6.2 Primary Analysis of Antibiotic Exposure 
The primary endpoint “short antibiotic treatments ” will be analyzed for superiority. We will assess the 
differences in proportions by [CONTACT_595406] (bet a-distributed 
study-arm specific probabilities) and uninformative uniform priors.  
 
More specifically, the following generative model will be used: 
NSPCT  ~  Binomial( N PCT, p PCT )  
NSCtrl  ~  Binomial( N Ctrl, p Ctrl )  
pPCT, p Ctrl  ~  Uniform( 0, 1 )  
with   
NSPCT, NSCtrl : number of patients with shortABx of the PCT arm and control arm, respectively  
NPCT, N Ctrl :  number of patients randomized to the PCT arm and control arm, respectively  
pPCT, p Ctrl :  shortABx probability for patients of the PCT arm and control arm, respectivel y  
 
Differences between study-arm specific probabilities will be computed by [CONTACT_595407]-arm specific posterior probabilities. Success of the analysi s of antibiotic exposure is 
specified by [CONTACT_726] 98.5%  [ADDRESS_786024] arm than in the control arm, i.e.,   
 
     Probability[ prob( short-ABx | PCT arm ) >  prob( short-Abx | c ontrol arm ) ] > 98.5%   
with   
     prob( short-ABx | PCT arm ) :  probability of short antibiotic treatment   
                                                           for patients randomized to the PCT arm,  
     prob( short-ABx | control arm ) :  probability of short antibiotic tr eatment   
                                                                 for patients randomized to the control arm. 
 
The primary analysis will be conducted based on the ITT population. The analysis will al so be conducted 
based on the PP patient populations and ITT- and PP-results will be compared and discussed. 
 
8.6.[ADDRESS_786025] secondary endpoint “composite adverse events until day 30” (CAE30) will be analyzed for s afety 
non-inferiority of the PCT arm vs. the control arm on the basis of the PP patient population. The analysi s 
will also be conducted on the basis of the ITT patient populations and ITT- and PP -results will be 
compared and discussed.  Differences in proportions of CAE30 between PCT arm and control arm will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_595406] (beta-distri buted study-arm 
specific CAE30 probabilities) and uninformative uniform priors. More spec ifically, the following 
generative model will be used: 
NE PCT  ~  Binomial( N PCT, p PCT )  
NE Ctrl  ~  Binomial( N Ctrl, p Ctrl )

pPCT, p Ctrl :  CAE30 probability for patients of the PCT arm and control arm, respectively   
 
Differences between study-arm specific CAE30 probabilities will be computed by [CONTACT_595408]30 probabilities p PCT, p Ctrl from their analytically computed study-arm specific posterior 
probabilities. Study success is specified by [CONTACT_726] 98.5%[ADDRESS_786027] arm smaller than the CAE30 probability of  patients of the control arm 
plus 10% (NI margin):   
  
     Probability( CAE30 probability of PCT arm < CAE30 probability of contr ol arm + 10% ) > 98.5% 1,           
 
or with the above introduced notation  
 
        Probability( p PCT < p Ctrl  + 0.1) > 98.5% 1 .   
 
8.6.4 Secondary Analysis of Antibiotic Exposure 
The second secondary endpoint “antibiotic exposure at discharge” will be analyzed for superiority. We 
will assess the differences in proportions by [CONTACT_595409] 
(beta-distributed study-arm specific probabilities) and uninformative uniform  priors. More specifically, 
the same generative model will be used as the one for short antibiotic treatments (see Section 8.6.2) . 
Differences between study-arm specific probabilities will be computed by [CONTACT_595407]-arm specific posterior probabilities. Success of the analysi s of antibiotic exposure at 
discharge is specified by [CONTACT_726] 98.5% [ADDRESS_786028] 
arm than of the control arm, i.e.   
     Probability[ prob( discharge-ABx | PCT arm ) <  prob( dischar ge-ABx | control arm ) ] > 98.5%  
with   
     prob( discharge-ABx | PCT arm ) :  probability of prescribed antibiotics at hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_595372]( discharge-ABx | control arm ) :  probability of prescribed antibiotics  at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_595373]. The analysis will als o be conducted 
based on the PP patient populations and ITT- and PP-results will be compared and discussed. 
 
8.6.5 Further Secondary and Exploratory Analysis 
 
1 Simulation of the selected adaptive Bayesian design with specified interim analy ses based on 200, 350, 550, and 
650 patients showed that the one-sided type-I error was controlled to be below 2.5% by [CONTACT_595410] 98.5% 
as the threshold for study success. See [SAP4.0] for more information.

36 
  Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be analyzed according to variable type:  
 
Numerical endpoints:   
Distributions of numeric al variables will be visualized for all patients and separately for PCT and control 
arm. Study arm-specific distributions will be compared with each other by [CONTACT_158092] (e.g . Wilcoxon 
rank-sum tests), and by [CONTACT_595395] (e.g. group medians and means) .   
 
Binary endpoints:  
2 x 2 contingency tables will be reported for counts stratified according to study ar m (PCT, control) and 
endpoint level (true/false). Associations between study arms and endpoints will be an alyzed by 
[CONTACT_158092] (e.g. chi- square test or Fisher’s exa ct test). Proportions and two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals or Bayesian credible intervals will be computed for all patients and s eparately for PCT and 
control arm .  
 Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the robustness of primary and secondary a nalysis results .  
• The results obtained for ITT and PP patient population will be compared and discussed.  
• Safety analysis (as described in Section 4.4) will also be conducted for the alternative s afety 
endpoint definition CAE30’ only counting safety adverse events that occur at least 24 ho urs after 
patient randomization. The results will be compared and discussed with the results fo r counting all 
safety adverse events after patient randomization.    
• For endpoints CAE30, shortABx, and prescribedABx the study-arm specific proportions will be 
compared and discussed with the corresponding proportions that were obtained for the tw o run- in 
studies that were performed for accurate calculation of sample size and required power; t hese first 
two ProSAVE pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-level study batches were named “ProSAVE -1 & - 2” (comprising 95 (ITT) and 60 
(PP) non-COVID patients not transferred to ICU within 24 hours, patients enrolled f rom 2020- 05-28 
to 2021- 02-24). 
• The safety endpoint CAE30 will be analyzed and discussed regarding its individual consti tuent 
adverse event variables. 
 
 Sample Size  
We plan to enroll an adequate number of patients for the study by a Bayesian adaptive design with a 
maximum number of [ADDRESS_786029] pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-level study 
batches, see Table 8.1 (analysis population and endpoint specific results; “ProSAVE -1 & - 2” comprising 
95 (ITT) and 60 (PP) non-COVID patients not transferred to ICU within 24 hours, pati ents enrolled from 
2020 -05-28 to 2021- 02-24). 5000 clinical trials were simulated per analysis setting (st udy 
endpoint, analysis population and assumed fixed sample size from 200 to 700 patients) with the 
distribution of events according to predictive posterior distributions (c omputed for the assumed sample 
sizes from pi[INVESTIGATOR_595374]). The 
corresponding statistical power estimates were determined as the proportions of study successes when 
applying the analyses and success criteria specified in Section 8.6.

 the times of interim analyses from 500 and 600 patients to 550 and 650 patients, resp ectively . The 
evaluation of the study design was done analogously to the initially applied method described in Section 
2.3.2 of [SAP3.0] (clinical trial Monte Carlo simulations based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_1427] y results). The new 
simulations (including some improved approximations of protocol and data generati on) for the 
implemented changes resulted in an increase of the analysis parameter  from 0.9785 to 0.985 in order 
to keep type-I error control at 2.5%. We valued the new design adequate with statistic al powers of 99%, 
75% and 48% to show shortABx superiority, CAE30 non-inferiority and prescribedABx sup eriority, 
respectively, assuming half of the effects observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_595377] 
(RR shortABx  = 1.9 and RR prescribedABx = 0.8 ) and considerably smaller CAE30 effects than observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480] (RR CAE30 = 0.[ADDRESS_786031] observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ). 
 Interim Analyses 
Interim analyses will be conducted after the enrollment of 200 patients, 350 patients, 550 patients and 
650 patients.  
After the enrollment of 200 and 350 patients an interim analysis will be c onducted applying a 
criterion for potentially stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589] . A non-binding recommendation to stop patient enrollment 
for futility will be given if interim results are not in a “promising zone” to reach the CAE30 success 
criterion. More specifically, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_595378] i f the posterior predictive 
probability of CAE30 success (i.e., proving non-inferiority) with the maximum number  of 700 patients is 
below a specific futility cut-off FN = 0.1 with N = 200 or 350 representing the respective enrollment 
status:  
  
Probability(CAE30 success with 700 patients | interim data )  < FN , i.e.  
Probability( Posterior predictive probability( p PCT < p Ctrl  + 0.1, 700 patients | interim data ) > 98.5%  1 ) < 0.1  
 
After the enrollment of 550 and 650 patients an interim analysis will be conducted applying criteria t o 
stop potentially (a) for futility or (b) for study success:   
 
a. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589]:    
A non-binding recommendation to stop patient enrollment for futility wi ll be given if interim results are 
not in a “promising zone” to reach the CAE30 success criterion. More specifically, enrollment will be 
stopped if the posterior predictive probability of CAE30 success with the maximum number of 
700 enrolled patients is below a specific futility cut-off FN = 0.1 with N = 550 or 650 representing the 
respective enrollment status:

b. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25492]:   
Enrollment will be stopped for success if interim results reveal a sufficient ly high probability

     Probability( shortABx success with enrolled patients | interim data )  > SN AND  
     Probability( prescribedABx success with enrolled patients | interim data )  > SN  
 
Note : Use of the posterior predictive probability will allow to conduct  the interim analysis in a timely 
manner without the need to wait for the completion of the 30 days follow-up times of all 
patients. Thereby, missing or incomplete endpoint data of enrolled patients will  be imputed by 
[CONTACT_595411].  
The cut-off parameters of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] F200, F350, F550, F650, S550 and S650 were specified 
by [CONTACT_595412] F200 = F350 = F550 = F650 = 0.1 and S550 = S650 = 0.9 to assure a sufficiently 
controlled one-sided type-I error < 2.5% and a sufficiently high statistical power (study success 
probability) assuming pi[INVESTIGATOR_143389], see [SAP3.0].    
     
 Safety Analyses for DMC (See DMC Charter for detailed information)  
Safety analyses will be conducted at least twice when 350 and 550 patients are enrolled. The DMC will 
receive corresponding safety datasets and safety relevant interim analysis resul ts:  
a. Safety datasets will be on patient level and comprise at least the following infor mation: study 
arm assignment, CAE30, and all single binary CAE30 endpoint components. The DMC may request 
additional data at its discretion.  
b. As safety relevant interim analysis results the DMC will receive:   
a. A contingency table of study arm (PCT, control) vs. safety endpoint CAE30 ( event 
occurred yes/no/NA; NA for patients with incomplete follow-up and no event  yet)  
b. 95% credible intervals of study-arm specific CAE30 probabilities and of the difference in 
CAE30 probability between study arms (complete case analysis)  
c. Posterior probability distributions on the basis of all patients with CA E30 data (complete 
case analysis) of  
a. study-arm specific posterior probability distributions of CAE30   
b. the difference in CAE30 probability between study arms  
d. Predictive posterior distributions on the basis of all enrolled patients (in cluding patients with 
missing or incomplete CAE30 data) of   
a. study-arm specific posterior probability distributions of CAE30

Used in conjunction with other laboratory find ings and clinical assessments, procalcitonin (PCT)  is intended for 
use as follows:  
• to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients on their first day of ICU admission for progression to 
severe sepsis and septic shock, 
• to determine the change in PCT level over time as an aid in assessing the cumulative 28-day risk of all-
cause mortality for patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in the ICU or when obtained in 
the emergency department or other medical wards  prior to ICU admission,  
• to aid in decision making on antibiotic therapy, for inpatients or patients in the emergency department 
with suspected or confirmed lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (LRTI) – defined as community -acquired 
pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis, and acute exace rbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(AECOPD),  
• to aid in decision making on antibiotic discontinuation for patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.  
 
Two systematic literature reviews were performed to produce both study and patient -level meta- analyses, which 
are studies that combine and contrast data from multiple sources to identify patterns among study results (FDA 
public docket FDA- 2016 -N-2880). The study-level meta- analysis used aggrega te descriptive information 
extracted from publications, and the patient -level meta- analysis used aggregate patient -level data from the raw 
dataset of each study. Each meta -analysis used random -effects models and calculated point estimates, 
differences, odd s ratios (OR), interquartile ranges (IQRs) and 95% confidence intervals as appropriate. The 
endpoints evaluated were: proportion of subjects initiating antibiotics, duration of antibiotic therapy, exposure 
to antibiotics, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], mortality, and complications (patient level only).  
The study -level meta -analysis encompassed 11 randomized control trials (RCTs) 12,14,15- 20,,24-[ADDRESS_786037] device

These meta -analyses concluded that PCT guided antibiotic therapy resulted in:  
• 19.2% reduction in relative antibiotic initiation for all patients  
• 38% reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) for inpatients  
• 51% reduction in overall antibiotic exposure (i.e. total days of antibiotic therapy) for patients who presented 
to the Emergency Department and other associated clinics, but were not admitted 
• 2.9 day reduction in antibiotic duration [1.25 day reduction in study -level]  
• 3.6 day reduction in total antibiotic exposure [2.79 day reduction in study -level]  
• No negative effects in regards to mortality, complications, or length of stay

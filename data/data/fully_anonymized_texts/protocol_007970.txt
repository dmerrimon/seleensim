Page 11PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale
Streptococcus agalactiae , also known as group B streptococcus (GBS), is an encapsulated, 
gram-positive coccus that is associated with lower intestinal and rectovaginal colonization.There are 10 serotypes of GBS (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX) differentiated by [CONTACT_626792]. All GBS serotypes have been found to cause disease, but there is variability in their global prevalence and virulence. GBS disease is most frequently found in the very young—newborns and infants younger than 3 months of age—and the elderly, especially older adults with comorbid conditions. However, disease due to GBS has been reported in individuals of all ages, and pregnant women may be particularly susceptible to GBS disease as well.
Among young infants, GBS is a leading cause of invasive bacterial infection, a significant 
cause of infant morbidity and mortality globally, and the leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in the [LOCATION_002].  Serious GBS disease, including sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia, is associated with mortality rates of 6% to 14% in high-income countries and 10% to 60% in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Of infants surviving GBS meningitis, one study found mild to moderate neurologic sequelae in25%, and 19% suffered severe sequelae, including cognitive delay, cerebral palsy, blindness, or hearing loss. In pregnant women, GBS may be associated with ascending infections ranging from relatively benign urinary tract infections to chorioamnionitis (which may result in stillbirth or preterm delivery) and puerperal sepsis (which may be fatal).  Serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, and V are most frequently associated with GBS disease in infants. Serotype IV shows a trend of increased prevalence in certain regions. GBS disease in infants is often classified as early-onset disease (EOD), which occurs within the first week of life, and late-onset disease (LOD), which occurs between Days 7 and 90.
The reported burden of infant GBS disease varies globally, and is influenced by [CONTACT_626793][INVESTIGATOR_626775], as well as by [CONTACT_626794], leading to the potential for underreporting, and underuse of intrapartum antibiotic therapy (IAP) to prevent GBS disease. In regions, such as the [LOCATION_002], where there are significant efforts and resources allocated for universal GBS screening of pregnant women and use of IAP to prevent GBS disease, the number of cases of EOD decreased since the 
early 1990s when recommendations for prevention were introduced. The incidence of LOD 
has remained relatively unchanged through the introduction of IAP in the [LOCATION_002].  Additionally, GBS disease in pregnant and postpartum women has not been reduced, as may be expected given the short course of administration during the intrapartum period only. In other countries where interventions are less widely used or a risk-based approach to IAP is used, such as in certain European countries, the trend in incidence rates may be unchanged or increasing slightly. Neither approach has eliminated GBS disease in infants. Even with potential underreporting, the highest rates of GBS disease are found in LMICs, where healthcare access and standards of prenatal care may vary, or the resources for significant preventive interventions are not available.CCI

Vaccination with tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in pregnant women was introduced in the [LOCATION_002]and in the [LOCATION_008] in response to a significant upsurge in pertussis cases in all agegroups. Maternal immunization against influenza was recommended by [CONTACT_626795] (ACIP) because of the increased risks of influenza and related complications in pregnant women. Safety surveillance conducted to date has demonstrated no unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or fetal outcomes.

Study Design
This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a multivalent GBS vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years.
Approximately 363 healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years of age will be randomized to receive a 
single dose of 1 of 3 dose levels of GBS6, formulated with or without AlPO
4, or placebo 
(saline control).  This study will utilize a sentinel-cohort design  
 
 
 
 
 
Blood will be collected at screening and at the 1-week postvaccination follow-up visit in all 
subjects enrolled in each sentinel cohort for hematology and chemistry assessments. 
 
. For all 
subjects, blood will also be collected on the day of investigational product administration prior to study vaccination and 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after vaccination for immunogenicity assessment. Local reactions and systemic events will be collected for 14 days after vaccination.  AEs will be assessed up to 1 month after vaccination. SAEs and MAEs will be assessed through 6 months after vaccination.  In addition, AEs occurring up to 48 hours after the Visit 5 and Visit 6 blood draws that are related to study procedures will be collected.

1.1. Indication
Group B streptococcus 6-valent  vaccine (GBS6) is being developed 
for:
Active immunization to prevent disease caused by [CONTACT_19313] B streptococcus (GBS)
serotypes contained in the vaccine.
1.2. Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Disease Overview
Streptococcus agalactiae , also known as GBS, is an encapsulated, gram-positive coccus that 
is associated with lower intestinal and rectovaginal colonization.  There are 10 serotypes of GBS (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX) differentiated by [CONTACT_626792].  All GBS serotypes have been found to cause disease, but there is variability in their global prevalence and virulence.
1,[ADDRESS_835257] frequently 
found in the very young—newborns and infants younger than 3 months of age—and the elderly, especially older adults with comorbid conditions.
3,4,5,6  However, disease due to GBS 
has been reported in individuals of all ages, and pregnant women may be particularly susceptible to GBS disease as well.
7  Among infants, GBS may cause serious disease,
including sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia; less common manifestations include skin and soft tissue, bone, and joint infections.
[ADDRESS_835258] infections to chorioamnionitis (which may result in stillbirth or preterm delivery) and puerperal sepsis (which may be fatal).
[ADDRESS_835259] infections are common disease manifestation of GBS infection in older nonpregnant adults.
5,10,11
1.2.2. GBS Disease in Infants and Pregnant Women
GBS is a leading cause of invasive bacterial infection in young infants and a significant cause 
of infant morbidity and mortality globally.4,12,13  The US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) notes that it is a leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in the [LOCATION_002].
14  Serious GBS disease, including sepsis, meningitis, and 
pneumonia, is associated with mortality rates of 6% to 14% in high-income countries and 10% to 60% in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
13,15,16,17  Of infants surviving 
GBS meningitis, one study found mild to moderate neurologic sequelae in 25%, and 19% suffered severe sequelae, including cognitive delay, cerebral palsy, blindness, or hearing loss.
18  Five serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, V) are most frequently associated with GBS disease in 
infants.  Another serotype (IV) shows a trend of increased prevalence in certain regions.4  
GBS disease in infants is often classified as early-onset disease (EOD), which occurs within the first week of life, and late-onset disease (LOD), which occurs between Days [ADDRESS_835260] common clinical syndrome in EOD is sepsis/bacteremia without a focus, whereas LOD is more likely to be associated with a focus,
3,6,15with meningitis being more common in 
LOD (21%-59% of LOD cases).3,6,15  Additionally, serotype III appears to be a relatively CCI

Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835261] 2017
Page 18prominent cause of LOD (causing 51%-67% of LOD),3,6,15whereas there appears to be 
greater diversity of serotypes causing EOD.
The reported burden of infant GBS disease varies globally, and is influenced by [CONTACT_626793][INVESTIGATOR_626775], as well as by [CONTACT_626794]. This may therefore lead to the potential for underreporting, and underuse of intrapartum antibiotic therapy (IAP) to prevent GBS disease.
4  In regions, such as the United 
States, where there are significant efforts and resources allocated for universal GBS screening of pregnant women and use of IAP to prevent GBS disease, it is notable that the number of cases of EOD decreased from a high of 1.7 cases/1000 live births since the early 1990s when recommendations for prevention were introduced to 0.25 cases/1000 live birthsin 2014.
19,20  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_626776] 2003 and 2007, the incidence in children <2 months of age was unchanged. This reflects the persistence of GBS LOD, which is the primary cause of bacterial meningitis in that age group.
21The incidence was 0.28 cases/[ADDRESS_835262] rates of GBS disease are found in LMICs,
15where healthcare

Adults 65 years of age are at increased risk for GBS disease, as are adults of all ages with 
associated comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, heart failure, and 
neurologic and urologic conditions.
3,5,6,23,24  According to the CDC Active Bacterial Core 
surveillance (ABCs) system, the annual US incidence of invasive GBS in 2014 was 21.1cases/100,000 in adults 65 to 74 years of age, 33.1/100,000 in adults 75 to 84 years of age, 
and 41.8/100,000 in adults 85 years of age.
20The distribution of serotypes causing the bulk 
of invasive disease in older adults overlaps with the serotypes causing GBS disease in infants.  Serotype V, however, is more prominent in adults than infants, and serotype IV is 
also emerging.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Maternal Immunization as an Approach to Prevent Disease in Infants and 
Pregnant Women
Vaccination of pregnant women has been used globally in the prevention of neonatal tetanus 
and more recently for prevention of pertussis in young infants, and to protect women and their infants against influenza.
26,27Tetanus toxoid vaccine has been used to vaccinate 
pregnant women in parts of the world for many years as an effective tool to induce immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that cross the placenta and after birth prevent neonataltetanus.
27There is also increasing experience on the safety, effectiveness, and acceptance of 
influenza vaccine and tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) for use in pregnant women in various regions of the world to prevent disease in newborns and infants. Maternal immunization against influenza was recommended by [CONTACT_626795] (ACIP) in 2004.
28  In addition, in 2009, 
because of the increased risks of influenza and related complications in pregnant women, the ACIP recommended that pregnant women receive both the inactivated influenza A H1N1 (2009) monovalent vaccine and the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine during any stage of pregnancy.
29  Safety surveillance conducted to date has demonstrated no unusual patterns 
of pregnancy complications or fetal outcomes.30In the [LOCATION_002], Tdap vaccination was 
initially introduced for unvaccinated pregnant women, and further expanded to all pregnancies in 2012. The [LOCATION_008] also introduced a Tdap vaccination program of pregnant women; both of these measures were taken in response to a significant upsurge in pertussis cases in all ages.  To date, these vaccines have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with single and repeat dosing.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Maternal Antibody and Protection Against GBS Disease in Infants
During the third trimester of pregnancy, only IgG antibodies are actively transported across 
the placenta.  This provides a means for protective antibody to be transferred from a mother to her newborn.
33  The efficiency of antibody transfer depends on placental integrity, 
maternal total IgG, gestational age at delivery, and IgG subclass (IgG1 subclass is most efficiently transferred).
27Researchers measured antibody in sera collected at delivery from 
GBS-colonized mothers whose infants had developed EOD, and in GBS-colonized women whose infants had not developed EOD.  There was a correlation between low maternal 
antibody concentration to serotype III (as measured in an IgG assay) and infant susceptibility 
to EOD due to serotype III.
34  Since the initial study, additional work was conducted 
demonstrating the correlation between serotype Ia–specific anti–capsular polysaccharide (CPS) antibody in the mother and protection of the baby [CONTACT_626796], and a directional effect with the serotype V antibody.
35,36,37,[ADDRESS_835264] other encapsulated organisms, and the antibody is transported across the placenta. These findings support the biological plausibility that increasing the levels of maternal anti-CPS IgG antibody by [CONTACT_626797]-specific 
antigens will increase the proportion of women with potentially 
protective levels of IgG and will result in placental transfer of protective antibody to a large number of infants.

Subjects will be screened from [ADDRESS_835300] to confirm that they meet eligibility (all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion)criteria for the study.
In the 14-day screening period, retesting of the clinical laboratory parameters will be allowed 
at the discretion of the investigator if abnormal test results are observed and if the investigator believes the results to be erroneous.  In this circumstance, subjects will return for a second screening visit within the 14-day screening period to reevaluate the abnormal laboratory parameters.
If the subject is found ineligible for the study on the basis of hematology and/or blood 
chemistry laboratory assessment and repeat testing is not warranted, the investigator may advise the subject of the results by [CONTACT_756], and the subject will be withdrawn from further participation in the study.  All eligible subjects (without laboratory abnormalities) will proceed to Visit 1.CCI

An investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a subject from the study if deemed appropriate.  
In addition, if a subject fails to continue to meet the inclusion criteria, new information becomes available that would exclude the subject, or the subject develops a condition or situation that would meet exclusion criteria  
, the subject may be considered for withdrawal.
Reasons why a subject may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not 
limited to, failure to meet entrance criteria (screening failure), AE, death, pregnancy, protocol violation, lost to follow-up, no longer willing to participate in the study, study terminated by [CONTACT_3211], investigator declined further study participation, or any other reason.  Subjects who have received the investigational product will not be replaced regardless of the reason for withdrawal.
6.11.1. Withdrawal of Consent
After investigational product administration at Visit 1, subjects who request to discontinue 
further study procedures (eg, blood draws) at upcoming visits, ie, Visits [ADDRESS_835315] with him or her. It is permissible that Visit 5 and Visit 6 be conducted via telephone contact[CONTACT_626808]-specified safety follow-up procedures
only.  Subjects should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only from further study procedures (eg, blood draws) and/or postvaccination study safety follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.
6.11.2. Lost to Follow-up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing
status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by [CONTACT_74084]. Lost to follow-up is defined by [CONTACT_199857] a minimum of [ADDRESS_835316]’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor-retained third-party representative to assist site staff CCI

If, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow-up, then the last-known-alive date as determined by [CONTACT_109415]’s medical records.
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events section, Section 8.1.3 ) or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol-required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site.
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_401363]’s medical record.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.
If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
7. ASSESSMENTS
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact [CONTACT_19987].
7.1. Pregnancy Testing
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at 
least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed immediately before administration of investigational product.  A negative pregnancy test result is required before the subject may receive the investigational product. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by [CONTACT_110453] (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427].

Unless a time limitation is required by [CONTACT_240846], the samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the end of the study and then destroyed.  If allowed by [CONTACT_48355], stored samples may be used for additional testing to better understand the immune responses to the vaccine(s) under study in this protocol, to inform the development of other products, and/or for vaccine-related assay work supporting vaccine programs.  No testing of the subject’s genetic material will be performed.
The subject may request that his or her samples, if still identifiable, be destroyed at any time; 
however, any data already collected from those samples will still be used for this research.  The biological samples may be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality is maintained and no testing of the subject’s genetic material is performed.
7.3. Immunogenicity
Blood samples (approximately 30 mL/visit) for immunogenicity assessments will be 
collected from all subjects prior to vaccination (Day 1) and at [ADDRESS_835319] for immunogenicity will be 
approximately 180 mL (~30 mL/visit), or up to approximately 200 mL for those subjects who consent to a larger blood draw (~50 mL) at Visit 4.  Sera will be used for immunogenicity assessments and assay development purposes.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Fever
In order to record information on fever, a digital thermometer will be given to the subject 
with instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home.  Temperature will be collected in the evening daily for 14 days following vaccination (Days 1 to 14, where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) and at any time during the 14 days that fever is suspected.  Fever is 
defined as an oral temperature of 100.4°F ( 38.0°C).  The highest temperature for each day 
will be recorded in the e-diary.  In the event of a fever on Day 14, temperature will be 
collected daily until fever has resolved (1 day of temperature less than 100.4°F [38.0°C] in order to collect a stop date in the CRF).  A subject with a fever >104.0°F (>40.0°C) will be prompted to contact [CONTACT_626811]. Study staff must also contact [CONTACT_626812] a 
temperature of >102 F is entered into an e-diary. Temperature will be measured and recorded 
to [ADDRESS_835331] and then grouped into ranges for the analysis according to Table 6 below:CCI

If a fever persists beyond the end of the e-diary period following vaccination, the subject will 
be requested to report that information and/or any new AEs that develop to the investigator.  The investigator will enter this additional information in the CRF.
7.5.3. Laboratory Tests
For sentinel-cohort subjects, the safety laboratory tests in Table 7 will be performed at times 
defined in the schedule of activities and Section 6 of the protocol.

8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious AEs; and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report 
Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety Within [ADDRESS_835337] under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether associated 
with an AE), except occupational 
exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of 
whether associated with an AE)
Abbreviation: CT = clinical trial.
All observed or volunteered events regardless of investigational product group or suspected 
causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_835338] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow-up) information on previously forwarded reports.  In the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE CCI
Group B Streptococcus 6-Valent  Vaccine (GBS6)
C1091001
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835339] 2017
Page 55(see the Serious Adverse Events section, Section 8.2.3 , below).  In addition, the investigator 
may be requested by [CONTACT_22835]-up information in an expedited fashion.  This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this 
will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  Any pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safety ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by [CONTACT_456], any nonserious AE that is 
determined by [CONTACT_4685].  To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study.
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_626813] a severe AE occurring within 14 days in the sentinel and expanded cohorts or SAE occurring within 30 days after vaccination.  Additional information regarding such events and the reporting requirements can be found in the 
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously 
reported by [CONTACT_1177].  In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.
When a subject withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section, Section 8.1 , above.CCI

Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835340] 2017
Page 568.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and MAEs/SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including the screening visit, and from Visit [ADDRESS_835341] after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the sponsor.
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety.
Follow-up by [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both nonserious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF.
Follow-up by [CONTACT_626814] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as CCI
Group B Streptococcus 6-Valent  Vaccine (GBS6)
C1091001
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835342] 2017
Page 57defined by [CONTACT_456].  If the investigator’s causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearly documented on study records.
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2. Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically significant signs and symptoms;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity;
Progression/worsening of underlying disease;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency.
Additionally, AEs may include signs and symptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.CCI
Group B Streptococcus 6-Valent  Vaccine (GBS6)
C1091001
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835343] findings should be recorded as AEs when any of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol-specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_4687].
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:
Results in death;
Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.CCI

Page 598.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009], or any prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).  An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance.

Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same-day surgeries (as outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality);
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_17143]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery);
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.CCI
Group B Streptococcus 6-Valent  Vaccine (GBS6)
C1091001
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835345] 2017
Page 608.3. Severity Assessment
GRADE If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE.For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:
[ADDRESS_835346]’s usual function.
[ADDRESS_835347]’s usual function.
[ADDRESS_835348]’s usual function.
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not necessarily an SAE.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the subject’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4. Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in the safety database.
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are “susceptible” to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury (DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
Liver function tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in 
subjects enrolled in expanded cohorts in this study.  However, should an investigator deem it necessary to assess LFTs because a subject presents with clinical signs/symptoms, such LFT results should be managed and followed as described below.
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede total bilirubin (Tbili) 
elevations (>2 × ULN) by [CONTACT_626815] s.  The increase in Tbili typi[INVESTIGATOR_626786]/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/ALT and Tbili values will be elevated within the same laboratory sample).  In rare instances, by [CONTACT_626816], AST/ALT values might have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to Tbili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law CCI
Group B Streptococcus 6-Valent  Vaccine (GBS6)
C1091001
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835349] 2017
Page 61criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all 
other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST/ALT and Tbili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 × ULN AND a Tbili value 
>2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 × ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST ORALT OR Tbili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
oPreexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
oPreexisting values of Tbili above the normal range: Tbili level increased from 
baseline value by [CONTACT_8895] 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/ALT and Tbili separated by [CONTACT_726] a few weeks should be assessed 
individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within [ADDRESS_835350] and ALT and Tbili, laboratory tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase, and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by [CONTACT_20025] a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted.CCI
Group B Streptococcus 6-Valent  Vaccine (GBS6)
C1091001
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835351]/ALT and 
Tbili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology.
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an EDP occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy.
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to [COMPANY_007] Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural CCI
Group B Streptococcus 6-Valent  Vaccine (GBS6)
C1091001
Final Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_835352] 2017
Page 63integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety as SAEs 
follows:
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_835353].
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_4693], which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study, the CCI

8.4.4. Medication Errors
Other exposures to the investigational product under study may occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

Abbreviations: CRF = case report form; CT = clinical trial.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product by [CONTACT_1148], or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.
Medication errors include:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Other examples include, but are not limited to:
The administration of expi[INVESTIGATOR_149325];
The administration of an incorrect investigational product;
The administration of an incorrect dosage;
The administration of investigational product that has undergone temperature 
excursion from the specified storage range, unless it is determined by [CONTACT_233034].
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.

9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is 
outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
All analyses for both immunogenicity and safety data will be of descriptive nature.
9.2. Immunogenicity Analysis
For the immunogenicity analyses, 2 analysis populations will be defined: evaluable 
immunogenicity and modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populations.  To be included in theevaluable immunogenicity population, in general the subject must have been eligible for the study, have received GBS6 or placebo as randomized, have had blood drawn within the specified time frames, have at least [ADDRESS_835356] no other major protocol violations.  The evaluable immunogenicity CCI

The immunogenicity data will be summarized according to the vaccine as received for the 
evaluable immunogenicity population and as randomized for the mITT population.
Immunogenicity endpoints are secondary or  in the study as listed in Section 2.2
andSection 2.3 .  Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for all immunogenicity 
endpoints.  No formal comparison between dose groups will be made.
Descriptive evaluations include serotype-specific IgG GMCs and 
GBS serotype-specific IgG concentrations will be logarithmically transformed for analysis. 
For each serotype, GMCs will be calculated at all blood draw visits. Two (2)-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the GMCs will be constructed by [CONTACT_626817]’st distribution.
 
 
 
Detailed analyses of all the immunogenicity endpoints including graphical displays will be 
described in the SAP.
9.3. Safety Analysis
All subjects receiving a dose of GBS vaccine or placebo will be included in the safety 
population. For the safety analyses, subjects will be analyzed according to the investigational product received.
The safety endpoints as listed in Section 2.1 are primary in the study and their analyses are 
based on the safety population.
The safety analyses are descriptive evaluations of local reactions, systemic events, AEs, 
MAEs, SAEs, and laboratory abnormalities.  AEs will be categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).CCI

events collected, and laboratory abnormalities, with 2-sided 95% exact CIs as appropriate.
9.4. Analysis Timing
At the completion of the 1-month follow-up blood sampling and assays, an analysis of 
available immunogenicity and safety results will be conducted.  Analysis results with the safety data cutoff at 1 month after vaccination will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] E-DMC.  Additionally, the IRC will review safety data summaries prior to the enrollment of the expanded cohort at the same dose level as well as the initiation of each dose escalation as planned.  Data may also be summarized at other time points for regulatory purposes.  No multiplicity adjustments will be applied for these assessments.
After the completion of the 6-month follow-up visit, a clinical study report (CSR) including 
all safety and immunogenicity data gathered from before to within the [ADDRESS_835359] to ensure that 
the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and institution will 
allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct 
access to source documents to perform this verification.  This verification may also occur after study completion.
During study conduct and/or after study completion, the investigator site may be subject to 
review by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_4618], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].CCI

Page 68The investigator(s) will notify [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the subject’s medical records.  The investigator will promptly provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_593892]. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry.
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626787].  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearly identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICDs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of CCI

Page 69treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, 
meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_161723], according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged by [CONTACT_4618].
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_835362] obtain [COMPANY_007]’s written permission before disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12. ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, ICDs, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC.  All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately after the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory 
requirements, and the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki.

with applicable privacy laws.
The ICDs and any subject recruitment materials must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local 
regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws.
The ICDs used during the informed consent process and any subject recruitment materials 
must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_4618], approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC before use, and available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.
The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject before any study-specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject’s signed consent document.
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by [CONTACT_22844], or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately.
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by [CONTACT_1205], and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in All Participating Countries
End of trial in all participating countries is defined as last subject last visit (LSLV).
14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/EC, or investigational product safety problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of GBS6at any time.
If a study is prematurely terminated, [COMPANY_007] will promptly notify the investigator.  After 
notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_76626][INVESTIGATOR_4601] (if applicable) in a timely manner.  As directed by [CONTACT_4618], all study materials must be

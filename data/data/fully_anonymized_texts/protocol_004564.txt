BMS -986177/JNJ -70033093 Factor XIa Inhibitor
1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title:
A Global,Phase 2, Rando mized, Doubl e -Blind, Placebo -Controlled ,Dose -Ranging Study  of 
BMS -986177, an Oral Factor XIa Inhibitor, for the Prevention of New Ischemic Stroke or New 
Covert Brain Infarct ion in Pat ients Receiving Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_880417] (TIA)
AXIOMATIC- SSP: Antithrombotic Treatment with F actor XIa Inhibit ion to Optimize 
Management of Acute Thromboembo lic Events in Secondary  Stroke Prevention
Study Phase:
2
Rationale:
Bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) , is the major concern am ong clinicians when 
considering antithro mbotic therapy in patients with stroke and threatened stroke. A major advance 
of the past decade in anticoagul ation has been the introduction of selective oral direct thrombin 
and Factor Xa inhibitors (DOACs). The risk of ICH with DOACs is sharply  reduced compared 
with warf arin.
BMS-986177 (also known as JNJ-70033093) is a small molecule that binds and inhibit s the 
activated form of human coagul ation Factor XI (Factor XIa) wit
h high affini ty and select ivity. 
According to the scientific evidence accumulated to date, the inhibit ion ofFXI may provide a 
novel mechanism for systemic antithrombotic effects without increasing the risk of clinically 
significant bleeding in a variet y of condi tions predisposing to high risk of thrombotic events.
The rationale for this study  is that Factor XIa inhibit ion has the potenti al to reduce thrombin 
generat ion enough to prevent vascular occlusio n and embo lism wit hout impairing hemostasis. The 
following observat ions support this concept: (1) the highest levels of Factor XI activit y are 
associ ated with a heightened risk of ischemic stroke; (2) lower levels of Factor XI activit y are 
associ ated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke; (3) Factor XI deficiency is rarely associ ated with 
unprovoked major bleeding; (4) al though not done in participants with strok e, a Phase [ADDRESS_1230483] total knee replacement with another Factor XIa inhibitor 
provi des a proof -of-concept. The study  showed that reducing FXI levels to 20% or less than norm al 
with an antisense inhibitor of FXI synthesis reduced the risk of postoperative VTE compared to 
enoxaparin, without an increase in bleeding compared to enoxaparin .
The recent ly-reported POINT and CHANCE studies demonstrated that treatment with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_880418]. However, 
the residual risk for recurrent stroke remains high , even when patients are treated with combinat ion 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8258], emphasizes the cont inuing need for a more effect ive therapeut ic option.  
Two possible strategi es for achieving better efficacy  aremore potent antiplatelet therapy  or dual 
pathway  inhibi tion of  thrombus formati on.

than anti platelet therapy  alone. Arecently co mpleted drug- drug interaction (DDI) studyin healt hy 
volunteers was conducted to assess the safet y and tolerabili ty of multiple-dose BMS -986177 
200mg given twice daily (BID) for 5 days with and without dual antiplatelet therap y. Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_880419] 300 mg on Day 1 followed by 4 days of 75 mg clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 325 mg was 
administered once daily [QD] for 5 days. There were no ser ious bleeding events reported from any 
of the 113 healthy participants , including 37 participants treated with DAPT + BMS -986177, in 
the DDI study .There were afew minor bleeding events , which showed no trend toward any 
treatm ent group . These preliminary findings are consistent wi th the noti on that FXIa inhibit ion is 
associ ated wi th a low risk of  bleeding, and support the proposed clinical tri al wi th BMS -986177, 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_880420] .
Finally , the rationale for treating all patientswith aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] +clopi[INVESTIGATOR_880421] t rial data to support a net clinical benefit of ant icoagulation alone over antiplatel et 
therapy  for secondary  prevent ion of non-cardi oembo lic strokes.  As noted above, this si tuation is 
reflected in guidelines recommending antiplatel et therapy for secondary stroke prevent ion in this 
popul ation. The data summarized above support the hypothesis that inhibit ion of Factor XIa could 
be a promising target for antithrombotic therapy for stroke, potentially providing sufficient  
inhibit ion of thrombin generati on to prevent thrombotic vascular occlusion or embolizatio n 
without impairing hemo stasis .

Statistical Considerations
Sample Size : The primary endpo int for this study is the incidence of events within a co mposite of 
new ischemic stroke during the treatment period and ne w covert brain infarction (FLAIR + DWI) 
detected by [CONTACT_66577] [ADDRESS_1230511] with the MCP -MOD methodol ogy using simulat ions with the Dose -Finding 
package in Rstatistical analysis software . Simulations of 2500 clinical trials were performed, 
assuming a true incidence for placebo of 15%, a plateau shaped dose response relationship with 
maximum relat ive risk reduct ion of 32% for BMS -986177 100 or 200 mg BID relat ive to placebo, 
and reducti onsof 10%, 17.5%, and 27% for the 25 mg QD, 25 mg BID, and 50 mg BID doses, 
respectively . Candi date models included an Emax model, a logistic model, and an exponent ial 
model.
Using these assumpt ions, a total o f 2100 participants allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1:1 ra tio to placebo and 
BMS -986177, 25 -mg QD, 25 -mg BID, 50 -mg BID, 100 -mg BID, and 200 -mg BID groups provide 
approximately  80% power to demonstrate a dose -response relationship, with a 1- sided ty pe I error 
of 0.049. Without the 200-mg group, a total  of 1800 participants allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio to 
placebo and BMS 986177, 25-mg QD, 25-mg BID, 50-mg BID, and 100-mg BID groups woul d 
provi de approximately 79% power to demonstrate a dose-response relationship with similar 
pattern, but risk reducti on of 32% forBMS -986177 50- or 10-mg BID relative to placebo and 
reducti ons of 17.5%, and 27% for the 25 -mg QD and 25 -mg BID doses, respectively. Allowing up 
to 10% of participants who do not have a clinical event and also do not have a Day 90 imaging 
assessment, approximately andup to 2350 participants may be randomized. The frequency and 
reasons for missing data will be evaluated in blinded fashio n during the course of the study .
Statistical Analyses : Dose -response relat ionship will be analyzed based on a generalized Mult iple 
Com parisons and Modeling (gMCP -Mod) analysis for the BMS -
[ADDRESS_1230512] dose added to the ordered BID dose regimens. If a dose-
response relat ionship exists, then fitted estimates for the incidence of the primary endpo int will be 
calculated in each of the treatm ent groups using the selected dose-response models. An Emax 
model, a logistic model, and an exponent ial model will be used as the candi date models for the 
gMCP -Mod analysis.
Point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for the following event rates will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_1570].

(AVM) or tumor .
Note: Aclinical (standard -of-care) MRI scan can be used as the baseline MRI provided that the clinical 
MRI protocol and scanner have been pre -approved by [CONTACT_11343].a
Clinical Vascular Imaging XDoppler Ultrasound, CTA, MRA or Catheter Angiography t oascertain the presence of intracranial or 
cervical arterial atherosclerotic plaque, ulceration or thrombus in feeding artery . Use of available 
vascular imaging showing a qualifying lesion prior to the stroke event is allowed for participant s who 
cannot complete the vascular imaging within 48 hours of the onset of t heindex event.
 Note : Atherosclerotic plaque does not need to be severe or stenotic, but must be visible. 
Participan ts with complete occlusion of a cervical carotid or an intracranial artery that is proximal 
to the index lesion should be excluded.

commo n type of stroke (~80%). Primary brain hemorrhage is a less commo n cause of stroke 
(~20%) but is associ ated with considerable morbidity and mortalit y. Stroke incidence is strongly 
linked to age and stroke prevalence is increasing due to the ageing global population. 
Thromboembo lism is commo n to almost all types of ischemic stroke sso that inhibit ion of

ischemic attack (TIA). The risk of recurrent stroke is particularly high during the initial 90 days 
following ischemic stroke or TIA. Pooled analyses of observat ional studi es completed in 2007,
suggested the early  risk of stroke was 9.9%, 13.4%, and 17.3% at 2, 30, and [ADDRESS_1230528] 
decreased the recurrence rate but it remains unacceptably high. In two recen t clinical trials that 
investigated pa tients with acute ischemic stroke, the risk of recurrent stroke was 7 to 12% despi[INVESTIGATOR_880459] n intervent ions.4,5In patients with acute TIA, 
the rate of subsequent ischemic s troke i s somewhat lower, but still high, 4 %to 9% at 90 day s.2,3,5
The clinical ,time
-based definit ion of TIA has been updated to now include imaging toexclude 
evidence of tissue damage ,but the traditional time-based definit ion is still commo nly used in 
practi ce.6Clinically defined TIA and stroke form part of a  risk continuum and risks of early 
recurrent stroke, MI and vascular de ath are similar .7,8,9

3.1.1 Novel Antithr ombotic Mechanism of BMS -986177
BMS -986177 (also known as JNJ-70033093) is a small molecule that binds and inhibit s the 
activated form o f human coagulat ion Factor XI (Factor XIa) with high affinit y and select ivity. The

BMS -986177/JNJ -[ADDRESS_1230530] on hemostasis .14
The rationale for this study  is that Factor XIa inhibit ion has the potenti al to reduce thrombin 
generat ion enough to prevent vascular occlusion and embo lism without impairing hemostasis.
Whereas Factor Xa inhibitors block the tissue factor -activated coagulat ion process required for 
hemo stasis, Factor XIa inhibit ion blocks thrombus format ion through the “contact ”system, which
is not required for norm al hemostasis but appears to contribute to pathological thrombus formation.
The following observat ions support this concept : (1) the highest levels of Factor XIactivit y are
associ ated wi th a heightened risk of ischemic s troke15,16,17; (2) lower levels o f Factor XI activit y
are associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke18,19,20; (3) Factor XI deficiency israrely 
associ ated with unprovoked majo r bleeding21;(4) although not done in patients with stroke, a 
Phase 2study for VTE prophylaxis in patientspost total knee replacement provides a proof of 
concept. The study  showed that reducing FXI levels to 20% or less than normal wit h an ant isense 
inhibitor of FXI synthesis reduced the risk of postoperative VTE compared to enoxaparin, without 
an increase in bleeding compared to enoxaparin .14In patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, single 
doses of 100 mg and 300 mg BMS -986177 reduced clot formation in thehemodialysis circui ts, 
and was not associated with serious bleeding.22
The high residual risk for recurrent stroke seen in the POINT and CHANCE studies (see Table 3-
1),even when patients are treated withcombinat ion of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8258] ,emphasize sthe 
continuing need for a more effective therapeut ic option. Two possible strategi esfor achieving 
better efficacy are: (1) more potent antiplatelet therapy. (2) dual pathway  inhibi tion of thrombo sis.

Major bleeding increased by 70% (abso lute risk increase =1.2%) with rivaroxaban 2.5mg BID 
plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_880467].24
A recent ana lysis o f the patientsin CO MPASS who had a pri or stroke (3.8%=1,041) showed that 
the annual rate of ischemic stroke was reduced from 3.4% with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_880468] 0.7%
withrivaroxaban plus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [HR =0.42 (0.19 -0.92), nominal p =0.03) ].25In addition to a 
reducti on in MACE , asubstant ialreduct ion in recurrent ischemic stroke in COMPASS was also 
observed indicat ingthat the combinat ionof antiplatelet therapy  with an anticoagulant has the 
potenti al to be more effective than antiplatelet therapy  or anticoagulat ion alone for secondary 
stroke prevention.
Although the combinat ion of a low dose of rivaroxaban combined with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_880469] , the risk of bleeding increased more than the risk reduction for ischemic stroke. This result 
is attributable to the mechanism by [CONTACT_880562] : dose -dependent inhibit ion of the tissue factor -activated coagulation process wh ich is 
requi red for hemostasis. Increasing doses of FXa inhibitors cause progressive lymore inhibit ion of 
hemo stasis which can predispose to bleeding. In contrast to FXa inhibit ion which impairs 
hemo stasis, FXIa inhibit ionblocks thrombus formation wi thout im pairing hemostasis. The rari ty 
of serious bleeding in people with severe FXI defici ency is consistent with the lack of a significant  
effect of severely reduced FXI activit y on hemo stasis.[ADDRESS_1230533] ion.

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Anticoagulationhas the potenti al to cause majo r bleeding which has been demonstrated in all
clinical trials (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]29, WARSS30, WASID31, ESPRIT32, ARISTOTLE33, RELY34, ROCK ET 
AF35, COMPASS). And the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulation is heightened by 
[CONTACT_880563][INVESTIGATOR_880474] (ARISTOTLE33, APPRAISE -236, 
ATLAS -237, COMPASS24). Concern about bleeding is a major obstacle to use of ant icoagulation, 
even when clinical trial data show that the absolute risk of bleeding is lower than the risk of 
thromboembo lic events .38
A number of scores based on clinical factors (HEMORRHAGES39, ATRIA40, and HAS -BLED41) 
have been devel oped to predict the risk of major bleeding. However, none of the currently available 
scores aresufficient ly accurate in predi cting majo r bleeding in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillat ion (NVAF) to be used as a rationale to withhol d anticoagulati onto reduce the risk of 
thromboembo lic events, especially stroke .42In addition, some clinical factors (hypertensio n, 
stroke, renal impairment) included in bleeding scores also increase the risk of throm boembo lic 
events.
DOACs are a majo r advance in improving the safety  of anticoagulati on. The risk of intracranial 
hemorrhage, the most devastating kind of bleeding, i s at l east 50% l ower withDOACs com pared 
to warfarin in pat ients with NVAF.43
A recent publication describes uniform  definit ions of cardiovascular and stroke outcom es 
developed by [CONTACT_880564] (SCTI) 
and the U.S. Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) .44According to Hicks et al, “The aim is for 
clinical trials to apply the stroke definit ion to assess the clinically relevant consequences of 
vascular brain injury”.
In the context of the SCTI definit ion, a clinically meaningful benefit of treatmen t is not only to 
decrease the number of strokes but also to mitigate the clinical consequences of ischemic brain 
infarction. Since no single outcome measure can describe all the dimensio ns of brain infarct ion45, 
we plan to usemultiple instruments to assess the clinical consequences of brain infarction: 
National Inst itute of Healt h Stroke Scale/Scor e (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Montreal 
Cogni tive Assessment (M oCA), and Digit Symbo l Subst itution Test ( DSST; subtest of WAIS -IV).
The available preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that direct inhibit ion of Factor XIa by 
[CONTACT_20444] -986177 has the potential to reduce the risk of thromboembo lic events with a lower risk of 
major bleeding than currently available DOACs, even in combinat ion with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] +clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] , 
thus provid ing a favorable benefit/risk.

(sparing motor and speech areas of the brain) of the lesio n. Covert ,MRI -detected brain infarct ions
can have clinically meaningful neurological consequences. Covert brain infarct ions,by [CONTACT_154020],
do not produce symptoms of TIA or stroke but they can be associ ated with neurologic dysfunct ion
such as cogni tive impairment and gait abnormalit y.46,47,48Furtherm ore,covert brain infarct ions
areassociated wit
h an up to 5-fold increase in the risk of future stroke, even after adjust ment for 
other risk factors, and with an increased risk of dementia (HR =6.12, 95% CI:1.82 to20.54) 
independent ly of vascular risk factors and interim stroke.48,49,50Clinicians consider covert brain 
infarctions clinically relevant, and this is now reflected in the recent Am erican Heart Associ ation

5.4 Justification for Dose s
5.4.1 Identification of Effective Doses of BMS -986177
Ident ification of effective doses of BMS-986177 was based on inhibit ion of thrombus formatio n

This study will be using an Interactive Response Technol ogy (IRT) to centrally enroll  and 
rando mize all participants . Before the study  is initiated, each user will  receive log in informat ion 
and directions on how to access the IRT.
During the screening visit, the invest igative site will obtain the partici pant’s unique 5-di git 
participant number from the IRT system . Enrolled participants, inc luding those not dosed, will be 
assigned sequential  participant numbers starti ng with [ZIP_CODE], (eg,[ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE], [ZIP_CODE]... [ZIP_CODE]). 
The participant ident ificat ion number (PID) will ultimately  be comprised of the site number and 
participant number. For example, the first participant screened (ie , enro lled) at Site Number 1, will 
have a PID of  [ADDRESS_1230577] igative site will obtain the participant’s unique 5-di git

may be broken by [CONTACT_093]. The participant’s safet y takes priority over any other 
considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatm ent, the invest igator should 
determine that the unblinded informat ion is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the participant's 
immediate m anagement. In many  cases, parti cularly  when the emergency  is clearly not rel ated to 
the investigational product, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_53964]. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed wi th the Medical Moni tor, but the investigator al ways has ul timate authori ty for the 
decisio n to unblind. The principal invest igator shoul d only call in for emergency  unblinding 
AFTER the decisionto discont inue the participant 's study  medicat ionhas been made.
For this study , the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT system. I
n 
case of an emergency , the invest igator has unrestricted access to randomizat ion inform ation via 
IRT and can break the blind through the IRT system  without prior approval from the Spon sor. 
After the unblinding, the invest igator shall notify the Medi cal Monitoror Clinical Scientist . The 
method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT Manual. Parti cipant and 
unblinded treatment informat ion and the reason for the blind being broken must be recorded on

Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (see Sect ion 2). Protocol 
waivers or exempt ions are not allowed. All immediate safet y concerns must be discussed with the 
Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue 
or discontinue tr eatment.
Adherence to the study  design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essent ial and required for study  conduct. All screening evaluat ions must be completed 
and reviewed to confirm that potenti al partici pants meet all eligibilit y criteria before 
rando mizat ion. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all partici pants 
screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the parti cipant’s routine clinical  management ( e.g., blood c ount) 
and obtained before signing of inform ed consent may be utilized for screening or 
pre-treatment  
baseline purposes provi ded the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been 
perfo rmed wi thin the tim eframe defined in the Schedule of Act ivities.

9.2 Safety Assessments
9.2.1 Bleeding
The main safety endpo int assessment is majo r bleeding (based onBARC Types 3 and 5
definit ions). Participants with bleeding or suspected bleeding will be assessed and treated 
according to usual  clinical  practice at each site. Severit y of bleeding will be classified according 
to BARC, ISTH and PLATO ( Refer to the Study  Events Assessment Manual for definitions and 
details for the bl eeding endpoints ).
Approach to a Participant with a Bleeding Event
If a participant has a bleeding event requiring intervent ion dur ing the study, the following measures 
shoul d be considered:
Discontinue the study  drug (refer to Secti on 8.1, Discontinuat ion of Study Drug).
Usual treatment measures for bleeding events, including local pressure , fluid replacement and 
hemodynamic support, and blood transfusio n,if indicated
Other causes besides antithrombotic medication can contribute to the seriousness of the 
bleeding event (e.g., rule out thrombocy topenia, disseminated intravascular coagul ation, and 
other coagulopathies, kidney and liver dysfunct ion, concomitant medicat ions, etc. ) and should 
be assessed and treated accordingly
Consult ation with a coagulati on/hematol ogyexpert
Possibilit y of unblindin g at the di screti on of  the i nvestigator (see S ection 7.4)

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
The primary endpo int for this study  is the incidence of events within a co mposite of new ischemic 
stroke during the treatm ent period and new covert brain infarction (FLAIR + DWI) detected by 
[CONTACT_66577] [ADDRESS_1230639] with 
the MCP -MOD methodol ogy using simulat ions with the Dose -Finding package in Rstatistical 
analysis software . Simulati ons of 2500 clinical trials were performed, assuming a true incidence 
for placebo of 15%, aplateau shaped dose response relationship with maximum  relative risk 
reducti on of 32% for BMS -986177 100 or 200 mg BID relative to placebo and reductions o f 10%, 
17.5%, and 27% for the 25-mg QD, 25 - mg BID, and 50-mg BID doses, respectively. Candidate 
models included an E maxmodel, a logisti c model, and an exponenti al model.
Using these assumpt ions, a total o f 2100 participants allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and 
BMS -986177, 25 m g QD, 25 m g BID, 50 mg BID, 100 m g BID, and 200 mg BID groups would
provi de approximately 80% power to demonstrate a dose-response relationship, with a
 1-sided 
type I error of 0.049 (See Secti on 10.3.7 ).Without the 200- mg group, a total of 1800 part icipants 
allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and BMS -986177, 25
-mg QD, 25-mg BID, 50-mg BID, 
and 100 -mg BID groups would provide approximately 79% power to demonstrate a dose -response 
relationship with similar pattern, but risk reducti on of 32% forBMS -986177 50 or 100 mg BID 
relative to placebo and reductio ns of 17.5%, and 27% for the 25-mg QD and 25-mg BID doses, 
respectively . Allowing up to 10% of participants who do not have a clinical event and also d o not 
have a Day 90 imaging assessment, approximately and up to 2350 participants may be randomized. 
The frequency and reasons for missing data will be evaluated in blinded fashio n during the course 
of the study .
10.2 Populations for Analyses
The analyses will use several populations as defined below:
1)All Enrolled Participants : Incl udes all partici pants who si gned informed consent.
2)All Rando mized Parti cipants /Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Populat ion: Includes all participants who 
were randomized to a treatment, regardless of whether they  received study  drug or not.  This 
popul ation will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned at randomization.
3)All Evaluable Participants : Includes All Randomized Participants ,as above, excluding those 
participants’ visits where relevant protocol deviat ions occurred. The relevant protocol 
deviat ions will be pre -specified in the SAP prior to database lock.
4)All Treated Participants : Includes all participants who received at least one dose of study 
medicat ion.  Thi s will  be the primary populat ion used in safety  analyses and will  be analyzed 
according to the treatment assigned at randomizat ion, except in the following cases:
If a participant received the same incorrect treatment throughout the study (unt il either Da y 
90 or discon tinuation of the study drug), then the participant will be analyzed based on the 
treatm ent received.

If a participant received study  drug from more than one treatm ent group, and none of the 
administrations were consistent with the assigned randomized treatment group, then the 
participant will be analyzed based on the first treatment received.
5)Pharmacodynamics (PD) Populat ion: A subset of the ITT Populat ion that includes participants 
with at least one PD endpoint assessed fo llowing the first dose of BMS -986177.
6)Pharmacokinet ic (PK) Population for BMS -986177 ,clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] , and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: Includes all 
participants treated with BMS -986177, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] , and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], respectively, who also have 
at 
least one post -dose PK sample.
The primary  efficacy  data set will be the ITT populat ion.For the primary efficacy  endpo int 
analysis, the popul ationwill include all  Randomized Participants who:
have a primary endpoint event (a new ischemic stroke during the study period or a new covert 
brain infarct iondetected by  [CONTACT_880579] 90)
OR
have an evaluable MRI image onDay 
90.
For the primary endpoint, analys is will be performed using the Evaluable Participant data set as 
well as the Primary  Efficacy d ata set.
10.3 Statistical Analyses
The StatisticalAnalysis P lan (SAP) will be develo ped and finalized before the final database l ock 
and will describe the select ion of participants to be included in the analyses, and procedures for 
accounting for missing, unused, and spuri ous data. Below is a summary of planned statistical 
analyses o f the primary  and secondary  endpoints.
Except as otherwise noted, descript ive summaries will use data from all rando mized groups, while 
dose-response analyses of primary and secondary  endpo ints will use data from participants 
rando mized to placebo, 25 mg QD and 25 m g, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg BID groups.
A descri ptionof the participant popul ation will be included in the statistical output reported, 
including subgroups of age, gender ,and race.

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADV ERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defined as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent 
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, cons idered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, t he reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study intervent ion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervention 
or a concomitant medicat ion.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untowa rd medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the parti cipant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it we re 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53912] (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53913]: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in 
admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
routi ne health assessment requiring admissio n for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine co lonoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative r eason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y

Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.11 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potenti al drug induced liv er injury (DILI) must follow the same transmissio n timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2. 7for reporting pregnancies).
Any co mponent of a study  endpoint that i s considered related to study  therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the rel ationship.
Alternat ive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study intervent ion administratio n 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion 
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.

Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study  treatm ent or if new 
inform ation beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.
REPORTING OF SAES TO S PONSOR OR DESIGNEE
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately wit hin 24 hours of awareness of the event.
SAEs m ust be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
The requi red m ethod for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.
The paper SAE Report Form  is only intended as a back-up option when the electronic

METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion m ethods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_42451]
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_1230667] a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type ofHRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal p roducts
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postm enopausal.

Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effec tive contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstine nce is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated w ith the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the dura tion of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must conti nue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence

bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficac y of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medicatio ns will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that c ould be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized.

BID dose arms (25, 50, 100 ,and 200 mg) using MCP -MOD to assess dose response, which allows 
assessment of mult iple different dose -response patterns. Wit h fewe r study  arms primarily focused 
on one schedule, the sel ected randomizat ion is more closely  oriented to assessment of the overall 
dose-response relat ionship with some improved power for detection of a dose -response (from ~77 -
78% to 80%). The modificat ion ofthe randomizatio n to a non response- adaptive rando mizat ion 
will be completed while the study  is still in the init ial “burn -in” period, ie, prior to addit ion of the 
200-mg doses and prior to when the response -adaptive rando mization was to be initiated. 
Participants who have received 50-mg and 100-mg QD doses will continue treatm ent until they 
complete the study  period. Data acquired in these subjects will be used for descript ive analyses, 
popul ation PK/PD modeling, and exposure -response analysis.

also, PK/PD modeling with assumpt ions around combinat ion dual ant iplatelet therapy  and exist ing 
data from direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC s) suggests there is potenti al for this dose of 
BMS -986177 to be efficacious in secondary  stroke prevent ion with a potenti al for lower risk of

Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 03, 05- Apr-2019
The purpose of this amendment is to update the protocol  in consideration of feedback from the 
study  sites, Steering Committee, and regul atory  agencies. Key changes include: allowance of 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_880525] 300 mg to 600 m g pri or to si gning of  informed consent; rem oval of 
aortic arch atheroma >4 mm in thickness fro m vascular imaging criteria; clarifying that MRI is not 
requi red to determine study  eligibilit y; clarifying Day 1, pre-dose assessments to be completed, 
adding instructions for missed doses; providing guidance for the management of bleeding events; 
modificati on of the PK and PD sample collect ion window for the 12-hour post -first dose time point 
and the requirement of a 12 -and 24 -hour PK/PD sample co llection for TIA subjects on Day 1; and 
change in the SAE collect ion duration after discont inuat ion of study medication. Addit ionally, new 
appendices were added for strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. An exploratory  objective was 
added to assess the incidence and characteri stics of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), hemorrhagic 
transformation of ischemic stroke and asymptomatic intracranial bleeding on Day [ADDRESS_1230675] the integrity of the study , such as 
typographical errors or cl arificat ions and changes in termino logy.The changes made in the body

Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 01, 20- Sept -2018
The purpose of this amendm ent is to update the protocol  in consideration of  
 further engagement with the Steering Committee (SC) and 
Key Opi[INVESTIGATOR_880536] (KOLs) which provi ded new insights into the target populat ion and 
operati onal feasibilit y of the protocol  as initially written. Key changes include the scenarios for 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_880537] 600 mg 
to 300 mg. Some inclusio n/excl usion criteria were modified to better defi ne the target populat ion. 
The collect ion of Barthel  Index, to assess the impact of stoke on daily living, was removed from 
the protocol. The introducti on of the high-dose BMS [ADDRESS_1230695] the scient ific 
integrity of the study, such as typographical errors or clarificat ions and changes in termino logy for 
“non -hemorrhagic stroke” to “ischemic stroke” and “silent” brain infarct ion to “covert” brain 
infarction .The changes made in the body  of the protocol  were also implemented in the Synopsis 
where applicable. The table below highlights the key changes made to the body of the protocol 
starting at Section 2.

Updated study  schematic (Fi gure

The enro llment of participant to 
the 200 m g QD or BID 
BMS -986177 doses was also 
changed to be implemented in a 
staggered mannerClopi[INVESTIGATOR_880540] 600 m g to 300 m g due to similar 
clinical outcomes between these two 
loading doses (i e, CHANCE vs. POINT) 
and concerns about site/country  
acceptabilit y since the study  is planned 
for global recrui tment.
The Day  90 MRI window was clarified 
to allow flexibilit y in an attempt to 
minimize Day  90 MRI data l oss.
As BMS -986177 has not been studied in 
this acute stroke populat ion in 
combinat ion with DAPT therapy , it is 
prudent for the Sponsor to take a 
staggered approach to ensure patient 
safet y. There fore, the high doses of 
BMS -986177 will not be started until 
some safety  data are obtained and 
reviewed by  [CONTACT_1363].

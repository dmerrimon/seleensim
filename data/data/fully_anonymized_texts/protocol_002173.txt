 Multiparameter Monitor Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Validation Study 
PR2019-329  
Synopsis 
 
Purpose/ Objectives of the Clinical Investigation Plan 
The purpose of this study is to provide supporti ng documentation for accuracy claims for the Vital 
Detect blood pressure monitor on the intended adult population. A modified same arm sequential 
method with dual observer auscultati on will be used to collect data.   
The procedure, data collection methods and data analysi s that are outlined in this protocol follow  
 International Standard ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2:2018  Non-invasive sphygmomanometers — Part 2: 
Clinical investigation of automated measurement type 
 
The end goal is to provide Non-invasive Blood Pressu re (NIBP) accuracy data to support validation of 
the Vital Detect blood pressure monitor. 
Background 
Automated blood pressure cuff measurement is the standard in numerous medical settings today. 
Oscillometric devices using deflation algorithms es timate the amplitude of pressure changes as the 
cuff deflates from above the systolic pressure. The amplitude suddenly increases as the pulse breaks 
through the occlusion of the artery. As the cuff pre ssure decreases further, the pulsations increase in 
amplitude, reaching a maximum level (which approx imates the mean pressure), and then diminishes. 
Studies show that, especially in critical cases (a rrhythmia, vasoconstriction, hypertension, shock), 
oscillometric devices are more accurate and consistent than devices using other non-invasive 
measuring techniques.  
 
This study is designed to assess the accuracy of the Vital Detect blood pressure monitor with an adult 
population using a modified same arm sequential dual observer auscultation method and is 
considered investigationa l for this evaluation.  
 Summary Overview  
The Vital Detect blood pressure monitor will be evaluated in two phases, Phase [ADDRESS_678914] of 30 subjects that will approxim ate the distribution of blood pressures as outlined 
in ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2:2018. Upon completion of Phase 1, an interi m analysis will be performed to determine 
whether or not to proceed with Phase 2. Phase [ADDRESS_678915] a minimum of 55 additional subjects to 
achieve a minimum of 85 subjects. The maximum number of subjects enrolled will not exceed 150 
subjects. 
 
Two trained observers, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a Registered Nurs e (RN) or Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), will 
observe (listen to) the Korotkoff sounds at the br achial artery of the arm. The reference blood 
pressure measuremen ts by [CONTACT_523173] t he device under test. The

 Risks and benefits of the Investigational device and clinical investigation 
Currently the FDA defines blood pressure devices as Class II devices CFR Section: 21 CFR 
§870.1130, Noninvasive Blood Pressure Measuremen t System.  – Cardiovascular Diagnostic 
Devices. The devices under test in this study are thereby [CONTACT_523175]-significant risk 
devices.  
 
The device and use of the device under test does not meet the definition of significant risk device 
under 21 CFR 812.3(m)  
 For the purpose of this study: 
It is not intended as an implant. 
o The cuff is applied to the bicep and is removed following data collection, typi[INVESTIGATOR_517835] [ADDRESS_678926] udy / study population (See description of Study 
Population below). There may be othe r risks to the subject associated with the device or procedure 
that are unforeseeable at this time.  
 
Blood Pressure Cuff 
 The reported risks associated with NIBP include: A) slight discomfort upon inflation of the cuff; B) 
possible bruising; C) petechial rash; and D) disco loration of the skin beneath the cuff. In rare 
instances the reported risks associated with NIBP incl ude: A) peripheral nerve injuries; B) skin tear; 
and C) compartment syndrome (swelling of muscles in the limb causing the reduction of the blood 
supply to the muscle).  
More than 3,[ADDRESS_678927] had their blood pressures taken 
repeatedly in 104 studies using similar equipment.  In these previous studies, the complications of taking repeated blood pressures were temporary a nd involved either bruising/rash; for example, 
petechiae rash (less than 2.2%), skin redness/lines (0.8%), or ti ngling/discoloration in the extremity 
wearing the cuff while the cuff is inflated (0.1%).

 ECG Electrodes 
Materials (such as the adhesives and/or gel contact) used in the electrodes may cause some skin 
irritation in some subjects.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_523169] s present with redness of skin and in some cases of 
sensitivity is an allergic reacti on.  Biocompatibility testing for su rface contact [CONTACT_164283] a 
requirement of the international Standards Organization (ISO) [ZIP_CODE]- Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices.  The risk in the use of ECG electrodes is believed to be minimal. 
  
 
Pulse Oximetry Sensor 
Pulse Oximetry Sensor placement involves positioning pulse oximetry sensors on the volunteer 
subject in the same manner that is used on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482825].  The sensors may be warm to the 
touch. Under normal operating conditions, (no faul t conditions), the sensors are not expected to

minimal amount of pressure. They should not caus e discomfort. If the sensor s are too uncomfortable, 
they will be removed immediately.  Adhesive sensors or tape may cause some irritations to the skin in 
some subjects. Every effort will be made to minimize  products with natural rubber or late x. Products 
containing natural rubber or latex will be identified.  The risk in the use of pulse oximetry sensors is 
believed to be minimal. 
 
General Electrical Equipment 
Electrical hazards are a potential risk with all electrical equipment.  The equipment used in this study has been designed to meet applicable safety standards.  The equipment will be safety and 
functionally tested by [CONTACT_523176] (as indicated) prior to patient use. T he possibility of 
any electrical hazard is extremely remote.    
Benefits 
The benefits to the study are to the advancement of non-invasive medical monitoring of patients by 
[CONTACT_523177]-invasive blood pressure measurements. The only 
alternative to this study is to NOT participate.

The Vital Detect blood pressure monitor will be evaluated as a comparat ive, single center, non-
randomized, study in a minimum of [ADDRESS_678930] or his/her legally authorized repr esentative will be provided an IRB approved Informed 
Consent. As applicable, subjects will be told about any new information that might change their decision to participate. Subjects who have completed the informed consent and health questionnaire 
form and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study if they meet desired blood 
pressure demographics. The study will be explained within his/her ability to understand.  
Phase [ADDRESS_678931] memory will be cleared prior to the nex t determination. In some cases, this may mean 
powering down the device to clear the previous readings. The observers will complete 1 or 2 initial 
baseline blood pressure measurements and then 3 to  8 paired NIBP measurements to be collected 
for the Accuracy evaluation will follow. Any pair of observers’ determinations wi th a difference greater 
than 4 mmHg shall be excluded. If any determinations are excluded, additional pair(s) of determinations shall be taken to ensure that  the needed number of valid test-reference  pairs is 
collected (up to a maximum of 8 paired readings). In  some cases, it may be that only 2 valid paired 
readings are achieved. This protocol allows for up to 10% of the subjects to have 2 valid paired 
observations (90% or more will contribute 3 paired ob servations). In this case, additional subjects 
shall be used to complete the minimum number of paired observations.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_678932]

determination. Each observer’s recording of obser vations of the reference sphygmomanometer shall 
not be visible to the other observer.  The observers will record the exact measurement heard during 
auscultation and will not round the blood pressure readings.  The readings of the sphygmomanometer-under-test shall not be visible to ei ther of these observers.  Each subject test is 
expected to take up to 60 minutes for the enrollment / data collection process.

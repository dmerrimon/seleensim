1. Introduction  
This document  is a protocol  for a prospective,  randomized,  open -labeled  study  to evaluate  the safety  and efficacy  
of the QuikClot® Radial® pad on hemostasis  after TRA,  compared  to the standard  of care device,  the TR Band®, by 
[CONTACT_290357],  local  vascular  complications,  and the time taken  to achieve  hemostasis.  
This study  is to be conducted  according  to US and international  standards  of Good  Clinical  Practice  (FDA  Title 21 
part 812 and International  Conference  on Harmonization  guidelines),  applicable  government  regulations  and 
Memorial  Healthcare  System  research  policies  and procedures.  Collection,  recording,  and reporting  of data will be 
accurate  and will ensure  the privacy,  health , and welfare  of research  subjects  during  and after the study.  
1.[ADDRESS_354188]  and increased  use of the radial  artery  (RA)  as the preferred  access  site for cardiac  
catheterization  (CC)  and/or  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI)  due to its proven  clinical  benefits,  including  
fewer  access -site complications,1-[ADDRESS_354189]-elevation  myocardial  infarction  compared  with the femoral  artery  (FA) approach.8,9  In addition,  
patients overwhelmingly  prefer  RA over  FA access  because  of the increased  comfort  after the procedure.  2, 3, 7 
Radial  artery  occlusion  (RAO),  however,  is still an important  complication  seen in up to 8% of patients  undergoing  
TRA.10-12 RAO  is known  to be associated  with use of large‐size catheters,  lack of procedural  anticoagulation,  and 
prolonged  duration  of radial  compression  after sheath  removal.10-[ADDRESS_354190]  common  compression  device  used in the United  States  is the TR Band® (Terumo,  Japan),  which  is the standard  
of care device  now being  used to obtain  radial  artery  hemostasis  after TRA.  This device wraps  around  the wrist  and 
applies  direct  pressure  to the radial  arteriotomy  site, typi[INVESTIGATOR_290337] 2 to 3 hours  after sheath  removal,  to achieve  
hemostasis.  It is unclear,  however,  if using  shorter  compression  times  will further  reduce  the incidence  of RAO 
without  compromising  hemostasis.  
QuikClot® Radial® pad is a new hemostatic  dressing  that is composed  of a kaolin -impregnated  gauze.  When  kaolin  
contacts  blood  it immediately  initiates  the clotting  cascade  by [CONTACT_290358], resulting  in shortened  
hemostasis  times.14-16 Application  of QuikClot® hemostatic  pads over femoral  artery  access  sites after PCI has been  
shown to  reduce  time to hemostasis with  early  ambulation.14 Recently,  we applied  the QuikClot® Radial® pad with 
an elastic  adhesive  bandage  supplied  by Z-Medica,  LLC to achieve  radial  hemostasis  after TRA  with 5 minutes  of 
manual  compression  followed  by 25 or 55 minutes  of elastic  adhesive  bandage  compression  in 20 patients.  There  
was 100%  successful  hemostasis  with the use of the QuikClot® Radial® pad in both groups  with no rebleeding  or 
increased  complications  noted  when  compared  with the TR band®.15 Some  subjects  in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_290338],  though.  It was uncomfortable  to remove  because  of the strong  
adhesive  pulling  their skin upon  bandage  removal.  The operators  also felt the elastic  bandage  was a bit complicated  
to apply.  Because  of this, we conducted  another  small  pi[INVESTIGATOR_290339]  a 
Coba n™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  to secure  the QuikClot® Radial® pad for achieving  hemostasis  post TRA,  
in hopes  of improving  patient  comfort  and satisfaction.  The results  showed  that 5 minutes  of initial  manual

compression  followed  by 25 minutes  of light compression  with either  a Coban ™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  
was successful  in the 20 patients  who underwent  diagnostic  cardiac  catheterization  and/or  PCI, with 100%  
successful  initial  hemostasis  without  rebleeding,  RAO,  and other  complications.  This preliminary  clinical  
evaluation  suggested  the QuikClot® Radial® pad combined  with either  a Coban ™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  
was an easy to use and effective  hemostatic  dressing  that allowed  for a short  duration  of compression  and a painless  
hemostasis  procedure  without  vascular  or other  complications  noted.  
We were  encouraged  by [CONTACT_290359]  Radial  pad in the above  small  pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].  The 
small  sample  sizes  did not allow  a definitive  answer  as to whether  reduced  compression  times  with the QuikClot  
Radial  pad would  reliably  allow  significantly  shorter  hemostasis  times  allowing  for earlier  discharge  from  the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  lead to less RAO  post procedure,  or improve  patient  comfort.  We therefore  designed  the first 
version  of this larger,  adequately  powered,  prospective  randomized  trial to investigate  the safety  and efficacy  of 
the QuikClot  Radial  pad combined  with either  a Coban ™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  to achieve  
hemostasis  following  TRA,  compared  to the standard  of care TR Band . The QuikClot  Radial  pad will be 
applied  over the radial  artery  access  site using  either  a Coban ™ bandage  or only a Tegaderm ™ dressing  after 
TRA.  Then,  after sheath  removal,  firm manual  compression  will be applied  over the QuikClot  Radial  pad 
covered  by [CONTACT_290360] ™ bandage  or the Tegaderm ™ dressing  for 5 minutes,  followed  by 25 minutes  of 
light compression  with the Coban ™ dressing  in the Coban ™ cohort  or 25 minutes  of close  observation  after 
release  of manual  pressure  in the Tegaderm ™ only cohort.  
After an interim analysis of [ADDRESS_354191] (DSMB) committee review 
of the results, we elected to stop the Tegaderm ™ only arm. With a failure to obtain initial hemostasis at 5 minutes 
in approximately 30% of the subjects in this arm of the protocol, we believed there would be little chance of this 
Tegaderm ™ only protocol being adopted clinically. There were no safety issues with the Tegaderm ™ only arm, as 
with repeated 5 minute manual compression cycles of the Qui kClot  pad, hemostasis was obtained in all subjects. 
Mean hemostasis time in the Tegaderm ™ only arm was 8.[ADDRESS_354192] the Tegaderm ™ only arm. This new arm 3 will use a QuikClot  Radial  Pad under a 
TR Band  with [ADDRESS_354193] a large successful anecdotal experience of using a 
QuikClot  Radial  Pad under a TR Band  with [ADDRESS_354194] demonstrated 
that use of a hemostatic pad under a TR band® significantly shortene s hemostasis time, as compared to a TR 
band® alone, with no increased complications noted . [17,18 ]   
We will evaluate  patien t tolerance  of the device s, local  vascular  complications,  and the time taken  to achieve  
hemostasis  with the use of the QuikClot  Radial  pad and compare  with the standard  of care TR Band  on 
hemostasis  after TRA.  The results  to be obtained  will refine  the QuikClot  Radial  pad use in the setting  of 
hemostasis  following  transradial  procedures,  to hopefully  develop  a safe and efficacious  strategy  to achieve  more  
rapid  patent  hemostasis  following  TRA,  possibly  lower  RAO  rates with shorter  compression  times,  and improve  
patient  care by [CONTACT_290361].

1.2.1.  Device  Description  
The QuikClot® Radial® pad is made of a soft, white, kaolin ‐impregnated gauze.  The QuikClot® Radial® pad 
will be provided in a kit form that consists of a hemostatic pad and an adhesive bandage (Figure 1). The adhesive 
bandage is a Direct Pressure (DP) Bandage. The hemostatic pad is a  hemostatic dressing made of soft, white, 
kaolin impregnated gauze, configured in a 0.8” diameter by 1.5” long roll. The QuikClot® Radial® pad utilizes a 
layered clay hemostat, kaolin USP, which is bound to medical gauze. The QuikClot® Radial® pad are prov ided in 
a sterile, intuitive, simple to use dressing format that conforms readily to the wound. The DP Dressing is a Class 1 
exempt device and serves as a fixation/compression bandage which is in contact [CONTACT_290362], but 
is not in direct c ontact with the wound. In the present trial either a Coban ™ bandage or a Tegaderm ™ dressing 
will serve as a fixation/compression bandage instead of the supplied DP dressing to secure the QuikClot® 
Radial® pad over the arteriotomy site.  
1.2.2.  Intended Use  
The QuikClot  Radial  pad is applied  topi[INVESTIGATOR_290340],  percutaneous  catheters  or tubes  
utilizing  introducer  sheaths  up to 12  Fr and up to 7 Fr and for patients  on drug/induced  anti-coagulation  treatment.  
1.2.3.  Technological  Characteristics  and Substantial  Equivalence  
[IP_ADDRESS].  QuikClot  Radial  Pad 
The QuikClot  Radial  pad is intended  for control  of surface  bleeding  from  vascular  access  sites,  
percut aneous  catheters  or tubes  utilizing  introducer  sheaths  up to 12 Fr. There  are several  marketed  devices  
with similar  indications  that utilize  alternate  technologies  to achieve  the same  indications  as the proposed  
device,  such as the Vascular  Solutions  D-Stat Dry, WoundStat,  and the ChitoFlex ™ Surgical  device.  The 
QuikClot  Radial  pad is identical  in technology  to the QuikClot  Interventional ™ hemostatic bandage.  
The QuikClot  Radial  pad and the predicate  devices  are similar  in that they are all indicated  as an adjunct  to 
manual  compression  and are indicated  for the control  of surface  bleeding  from  vascular  access  sites and 
percutaneous  catheters  or tubes  and reducing  the time-to-hemostasis  in patients  undergoing  diagnostic  
endovascular  procedures  utilizing  introducer  sheaths.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  3M™ Coban™ Self‑Adherent  Latex -free Wrap  
3M™ Coban ™ Self‑Adherent  Latex -free Wrap  is a sterile,  cohesive  elastic  wrap  
constructed  from  a nonwoven  material  and elastic  fibers  (Figure  2). The cohesive  
properties  allow  the wrap  to stick to itself  but not to other  materials  or skin.  It is 
supplied  in individually  packaged  sterile  rolls.  This product  is not regulated  under  
the FDA,  and a MSDS  is not required  for this product  by [CONTACT_290363]    (29   CFR   1910.1200 )   because,    when    used   as 
recommended  or under  ordinary  conditions,  it should  not present  a health  and 
safety  hazard.  Coban ™ self ‑adherent  wrap  is intended  for use as an elastic  wrap  
to provide  compression  or support,  or to secure  dressings  or devices.  3M Coban ™ Sterile  Self-Adherent  Wrap

[IP_ADDRESS].  3M™ Tegaderm ™ Transparent  Film  Dressing  
Tegaderm ™ is a transparent  medical  dressing  manufactured  by 3M™. Tegaderm ™ Film  
consists  of a thin film backing  with a non-latex,  hypoallergenic  adhesive  (Figure  3). The 
dressing  is breath able,  allowing  good  oxygen  and moisture  vapor  exchange.  It is 
waterproof  and impermeable  to liquids,  bacteria,  and viruses.  An intact  dressing  protects  
the site from  outside  contamination.  Tegaderm ™ transparent  dressings  can be used to 
cover  and protect  wounds and catheter  sites.  Tegaderm ™ transparent  film dressings  are 
routinely  used in the Cardiac  Cath Labs  of MRH.  
1.3. Device  Usage  
Application of the QuikClot  Radial  pad will be performed  by [CONTACT_290364].  
Application  of the TR Band  will be performed  by [CONTACT_290365].  Proper  training  for physicians  for either  device  is defined  as performing  [ADDRESS_354195]  or industry  representative  experienced  with the either  
device.  For cath lab technicians,  proper  training  will be meeting  the qualifications  outlined  by [CONTACT_290366] . [CONTACT_290381],  [CONTACT_290382]  and [CONTACT_30616]  are 
properly  trained  with the use of the QuikClot  Radial  pad hemostatic  device  and TR Band . 
1.3.1.  The method  for using  the QuikClot  Radial  pad with  a Coban™ Self-Adherent  Wrap  is as follows:  
After  an end-procedure  ACT  is drawn  and the blood  pressure  is recorded,  the arterial  access  sheath  will be partially  
pulled   out  of  the  radial   artery,  exposing  approximately  4 cm of sheath.  The level  of the access  site will be 
marked  on the medial  and/or  lateral  side of the palm ar surface  of the wrist  with a sterile  marker  pen so that once  
the pad is applied  and covering  the access  
site, the investigator  will still be able to know  
the exact  level  of the access  site, to properly  
hold pressure  in the  correct  spot.  (Fig.4A,  
Arrows ). The QuikClot   Radial  pad is 
then applied  over the access  site, with the 
sheath  still in place,  with 1/3 of the pad 
being  distal  to the access  site and 2/3 of the 
pad being  proximal  to the access  site (Fig.4B,  
Arrows ). The 3M™ Coban ™ latex -free self-
adherent wrap  is then gently  applied,  wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
3-[ADDRESS_354196]  to hold the 
QuikClot  Radial  pad in place  (Fig 4. C). 
When  application  is complete,  the excess  self-
adherent  wrap  will be cut off (Fig.  4D). The 3 
– 5 layers  will then be hand  massaged  to allow  
the layers  to adhere  to each other  (Fig.  4E). The 
sheath  is then removed  from  the radial  artery,

Version  5. Dec 22, 2019   
 being  pulled  out from  underneath  the QuikClot  Radial  pad, with the investigator  slightly  pulling  up on the 
distal  portion  of the pad, allowing  for a small  amount  of bleeding  to partially  saturate  the under  surface  of the 
QuikClot  Radial  pad to initiate  the kaolin -blood  reaction  (Figs.  4, F and G). 5 minutes  of firm manual  
compression  is then held with several  fingers  on top of the QuikClot  Radial  pad, directly  over the access  site 
and just proximal  to the access  site, with the thumb  wrapped  under  the wrist  (Fig.  4H). After  release  of manual  
pressure,  the investigator  will observe  for bleeding  under  the QuikClot  Radial  pad/Coban ™ wrap  for one 
minute (Fig.  4I). If there  is not hemostasis,  manual  pressure  will again  be applied  over the QuikClot Radial  
pad for another  5 minutes,  and this cycle  will be repeated  until there  is hemostasis.  Once  there  is hemostasis,  the 
previously  applied  Coban ™ will be removed  25 minutes  (± 5 minutes)  after manual  pressure  is released,  
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_290341]  Radial  pad in place  over the access  site. A clear  adhesive  film dressing  (Tegaderm ™) is 
then applied  over the QuikClot  Radial  pad, to be removed  the following  morning.  If there  is 
oozing/bleeding  after the Tegaderm ™ dressing  is applied,  the investigator  may use his/her  discretion  to 
reapply  manual  pressure  to the QuikClot  Radial  pad, or  use mechanical  compression with a TR Band .  
1.3.2.  The method  for application  of the TR Band  
After  an end-procedure  ACT  is drawn  and the blood  pressure  is recorded,  application  of the TR Band  for transradial  
hemostasis  will be performed  as described  previously15 with the modifications  described  below.  Briefly,  the arterial  
access  sheath is partially  pulled  out of the artery,  exposing  approximately  4 cm of sheath.  A dry 4 inch by 4 inch 
gauze  will be placed  under  the exposed  sheath,  cinched  up to the skin entrance  site of the sheath.  The TR Band  
will be applied  snuggly  around  the wrist , with the sheath  still in place,  with the green  dot of the TR Band  2 – 3 
mm proximal  to the skin entrance  site of the sheath.  10 mL of air will then be used to inflate  the TR Band . The 
sheath  is then pulled  out of the radial  artery  and out from  under  the TR Band . The 4 x 4 gauze  is then pulled  out 
from under  the TR  Band . If there  is not hemostasis  when  the sheath  is removed,  additional  air will be added  in 1 
– [ADDRESS_354197] and recorded . Then,  the TR Band  will remain  in place  for 60 minutes.  At the end of 60 minutes  
(± 5 minutes)  of compression,  2 mL of air will be removed,  and then additional  2 mL at 80 minutes  (± 5 minutes),  
and then 3 mL at 100 minutes  (± 5 minutes),  and then the remaining  air slowly  deflated  over 30 seconds  at 120 
minutes  (± 5 minutes).  If oozing/bleeding  occurs  at any point  during  the weaning  of air, the previously  removed  
amount  of air will be re-inflated  into the TR Band , and weaning  will again  commence  in 20 minutes.  Once  all the 
air has been  removed  and hemostasis  confirmed,  the TR Band  will be removed,  and a Band  Aid or a dry gauze  
pad under  a Tegaderm ™ dressing  will be placed  over the skin entrance  site, to be removed  the following  morning.  
1.3.3 The method for application of the QuikClot  Radial  pad under a TR Band  
       After an end -procedure ACT is drawn and the blood pressure is recorded, the arterial access s heath will be partially 
pulled out of the  radial artery, exposing approximately [ADDRESS_354198] position of the skin access 
site, to properly apply  pressure with the TR Band  in the correct spot. (Fig  5. A). The QuikClot® Radial® pad is 
then applied over the access site, with the sheath still in place, with  approximately 1/2 of the pad being distal to the 
skin access site and 1/2 of the pad being proximal to the access site (Fig  5. C). This is best accomplished by [CONTACT_290367] a  QuikClot® Radial® pad face down on the sticky side of a Tegaderm ™ (Fig 5. B), centering it in 
the middle of the Tegaderm ™. The Tegaderm with  a QuikClot® Radial® pad stuck to it is then positioned slightly

the s kin access site and one half of the pad distal to the skin insertion site. The QuikClot® Radial® pad is then 
lowered onto the wrist, being held in the correct position with the Tegaderm dressing  (Fig 5 D)  A TR Band  will 
then be loosely applied over the Qu ikClot  pad covered with Tegaderm ™, centering the TR Band  green dot 2 – 
3 mm proximal to the marked skin entrance level (Fig  5, E). The sheath is then rapi[INVESTIGATOR_290342], and the operator will 
observ e for a small amount of blood  on the undersurface of the Qui kClot Radial Pad, then quickly fill the TR 
Band  with 8 – 10 mL of air (Fig  5. F, G, H). It is very important for blood to be in contact [CONTACT_290368], to 
initial the hemostasis reaction. If no bleeding is seen on the under surface of the QuikClot  pad w ith the TR 
Band  still being uninflated, the operator may lift up the uninflated TR Band  and QuikClot  pad under it, to 
initiate a small amount of bleeding, and then fill the TR Band  with 8 – 10 mL of air. If there i s continued 
bleeding after inflating  the TR Band  with 8 – 10 mL of air,  additional 1 – [ADDRESS_354199] 
and recorded. After 30 minutes of compression with t he TR Band , it will be deflated slowly over 1 minute. The 
deflated TR Band  will be left in place for 5 minutes, to allow for rapid reinflation if bleeding occurs. If there is 
hemostasis after 5 minutes of observation with the deflated TR Band , the TR Ba nd will be removed, leaving 
the QuikClot  pad covered with the Tegaderm ™ dressing . If bleeding occurs upon weaning of air, the TR Band  
will be reinflated to obtain a total of 8 – 10 mL of air in the TR Band  bladder for an additional 20 minutes. The 
TR Band  will then again b e slowly deflated over 1 minute , leaving the deflated TR Band  in place for an 
additional [ADDRESS_354200] the option to 
remove the QuikClot  pad, and use just a  TR Band , if the subject has failed at least one subsequent re -inflation 
cycle.   
        
1.4. Clinical  Data  to date 
The QuikClot  Radial  pad has received  FDA  clearance  for use in local  management  of bleeding  wounds  such 
as vascular  access  sites.  It provides  an alternative  to other  hemostatic  devices  and could  potentially  reduce

A previous  study  showed  that after removal  of 15 minutes  of compression  with the QuikClot InterventionalTM pad, 
active  bleed ing occurred  in 20% of patients,  compared  to 90% with 15 minutes  of manual  compression  only after 
percutaneously  accessed  femoral  arteries.16 
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_62848] 30 patients  undergoing  TRA  demonstrated  that application  of the QuikClot  Radial  pad with 5 
minutes  of manual  compression  followed  by a light compressive  elastic  bandage  supplied  by Z-Medica  LLC  for 25 
minutes  or 55 minutes  achieved  100%  hemostasis  following  TRA,  with no increased  complications  noted  (see Table  
below).15 
 
 
Our recent  other  prelimi nary study  (data  not yet published)  further  demonstrated  that application  of the QuikClot  
Radial  pad with 5 minutes  of initial  manual  compression  following  by 25 minutes  of light compression  with either  
a Coban ™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  was successf ul in all 20 patients  who underwent  diagnostic  cardiac  
catheterization  and/or  PCI, with 100%  hemostasis  without  rebleeding,  RAO,  and other  complications.  This 
preliminary  clinical  evaluation  suggests  that the QuikClot  Radial  pad combined  with either  a Coban™ bandage  
or Tegaderm ™ dressing  is an easy to use and an effective  hemostatic  dressing  that allowed  for a short  duration  of 
compression  and a painless  hemostasis  procedure.  Thus,  there  is a need  to assess  the true efficacy  and safety  of the 
QuikClot  Radial pad combined  with either  a Coban ™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  in the management  of 
radial  hemostasis  following  TRA  in a larger  number  of patients.  
1.5. Dose  Rationale  and Risk/Benefits  
The use of QuikClot  Radial  pad has been reported  in patients  under going  percutaneous  radial  procedures,  and the 
results  demonstrated  that application  of the QuikClot  Radial  pad with short -term (15 minutes)  radial  compression  
had 20% rebleeding  at the radial  access  site.16 Our recent  preliminary  results  demonstrated  that application  of the 
QuikClot  Radial  pad with 5 minutes  of initial  manual  compression  following  by 25 minutes  of light compression  
with either  a Coban ™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  was successful  in all 20 patients  who underwent  diagnostic  
12 
Version  5. Dec 22, 2019  
 
  
 cardiac  cathe terization  and/or  PCI, with 100%  hemostasis  without  rebleeding,  RAO,  and other  complications  
(unpublished  data).  We therefore  chose  these  same  compression  times  for this proposed  larger  study.   
After an interim analysis of 186 subjects, with a failure to o btain initial hemostasis at 5 minutes in approximately 
30% of the subjects in th e Tegaderm ™ only arm of the protocol, we believed there would be little chance of this 
Tegaderm ™ only protocol being adopted clinically.  Our DSMB committee reviewed the results  and recommended 
to stop the Tegaderm ™ only arm in the prior protocol.  There were no safety issues with the Tegaderm ™ only arm, 
as with repeated manual compression cycles of the QuikClot  pad, hemostasis was obtained in all subjects. There 
was just clinica l futility of this arm of the protocol as written that was not detected in the small pi[INVESTIGATOR_290343].  A new arm [ADDRESS_354201] the old Tegaderm ™ only arm  in this present revised protocol . This 
new arm 3 will use a QuikClot  pad un der a TR Band  with [ADDRESS_354202] a large 
successful anecdotal experience of using a QuikClot  pad under a TR Band  with [ADDRESS_354203] been successfully used under a TR Band  [17, 18 ]. As we have  a large anecdotal 
successful experience of 30 minutes of compression with QuikClot  Radial and QuikClot Interventional Pads 
under a TR Band , we choose a compression time of 30 minutes for the QuikClot /TR Band  arm.  
Although  the TR Band  radial  compress ion device  has been  used for years  as the standard  of care for hemostasis  
after TRA,  there  is no “standardized”  compression/weaning  technique.  In a previous  study,  we used 40 minutes  of 
compression  with the TR Band  and then began  weaning.  50% of subjects  had to have air re-inflated  upon  the initial  
weaning  of the TR Band .15 Carrington  reported  that a 1-hour commencement  of TR Band  weaning  following  
TRA  appears  to be safe, with an 84% success  rate.19 Because  of this, the TR Band  in this study  will be inflated  for 
60 minutes  of compression  without  weaning,  and then weaned  over the next 60 minutes  to hopefully  achieve  a high 
rate of hemostasis  with a low rate  RAO.  
Potential  risks may include:  bleeding,  pseudoaneurysm  formation,  hematoma,  radial  artery  occlu sion,  local  skin 
reaction  (redness,  swelling,  and rash),  pain,  and numbness.  Subjects  may or may not have some  or all of these  risks 
from  treatment  with either  one of the devices  used in this study.  The risks for the use of the QuikClot  Radial  pad 
are the same  as for standard  of care with TR Band . 
There  may be an immediate  potential  benefit  to patients.  Application  of the QuikClot  Radial  pad may shorten  the 
time of compression  compared  with the standard  of care TR Band . Shorter  radial  artery  compressi on times  have 
been  associated  with less radial  artery  occlusion,  thus potentially  reducing  the incidence  of post-procedural  radial  
artery  occlusion.  The light compression  with either  a Coban ™ may help maintain  patent  hemostasis.  Patient  
discomfort  may also be reduced  by [CONTACT_290370].  
1.6. Anticoagulation  
For diagnostic  cardiac  catheterization  using  TRA  in this study,  a heparin  dose of 70 units/kg  will be used,  with a 
minimum  of [ADDRESS_354204]  of > 250 – [ADDRESS_354205]  FDA  approved  doses  described  in the package  insert  may be used 
at the operator’s  discretion.  The option  of continuing  a heparin  or bivalirudin  infus ion after the PCI will be at the 
operator’s  discretion.  
2. Study  Objectives  
The objective  of this study  is to evaluate  the safety  and efficacy  of a kaolin –based  QuikClot  Radial  pad combined  
13 
Version  5. Dec 22, 2019  
 
  
 with either  a Coban ™ bandage  or TR Band  to achieve  hemostasis  after TRA,  compared  with ‘standard  of care’  
mechanical  compression  with the TR Band , with the aim to hopefully  develop  a safe and possibly  superior  
hemostatic  method  after transradial  access,  thus improving  patient  care by [CONTACT_290371]. 
3. Study  Design  
3.1. General  Design  
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192]  (Standard  Protocol  Items  for randomized  Trials)  recommendations  were  followed  in preparing  the 
protocol.20, 21 The study  is a single  center,  prospective,  randomized,  controlled  trial with three  arms  (below)  to 
compare  hemostasis  times  and potential  complications  after TRA  in patients  undergoing  diagnostic  cardiac  
catheterizations  and/or  PCI. 
 
 
 
 
  Up to now, [ADDRESS_354206] been enrolled in this trial per the previou s version of this protocol, including 73 in 
the QuikClot /Tegaderm ™ arm, 72 in the TR Band  only arm, and 72 in the QuikClot /Coban ™ arm. This 
amended protocol will continue enrolling a total of 100 subjects for both the TR Band  only and the 
QuikClot /Coban ™ arms, respecti vely. The new arm 3, QuikClot /TR Band , will also enroll a total of [ADDRESS_354207] been 
enrolled in the prior version of the protocol, and an additional 156 sub jects enrolled in this amended protocol . 
Randomization o f the 156 subjects  in the amended protocol will continue into the 3 cohorts . As 100 subjects will 
be needed to fill the new Arm 3, QuikClot /TR Band , and only 28 subjects will be needed to fill each of Arms 1 
and 2, i.e. the TR Band  and QuikClot /Coban ™ Arms ,arms 1 and 2 will fill well before the new Arm 3. After 
Arms 1 and 2 are filled, participants assi gned to Arms 1 and 2 will be considered screen failures. A ll screen 
failures  in this revised prot ocol will be assigned into the new Arm 3, the QuikClot /TR Band  arm. As the old 
arm [ADDRESS_354208] 
randomized to Arm 1 (TR Band ) who is a diagnostic cath only, and the [ADDRESS_354209] would then be assigned to new Arm 3, the QuikClot /TR Band  arm. Another 
example would be a participant randomized to Arm 3. As the old Arm 3 from the prior protocol is now closed, any 

14 
Version  5. Dec 22, 2019  
 
  
 subsequent participants randomized to Arm 3 will be considered screen failures, and will be assigned to the new 
Arm 3 of this revised protocol. Each  arm of 100 patients  will include  50 diagnostic -only cardiac  catheterizations  
and 50 PCIs.  Simultaneous  accrual  of diagnostic -only cardiac  caths  and PCIs  will occur.  
 
 
 
Scheme 1. Proposed  workflow for  two compression  devices:  QuikClot® Radial® pad and  TR Band® 
 
3.2. Primary  Study  Endpoints  
3.2.1.  Initial  successful  hemostasis:  Initial  successful  hemostasis  is defined  as no evidence  of external  bleeding  
from  the TRA  puncture  site or expanding  hematoma  of the forearm  after completion  of the above  described  TR 
Band  and QuikClot  Radia  pad protocols,  without  the need  for reinflation  of air in the TR Band  or 
reapplication  of manual  pressure  over the QuikClot  Radial pad secured  with a Coban ™ bandage,  or use of 
manual  compression  over the arteriotomy  site. If an EASY  grade  class  1 forearm  hematoma  (see below  section  
3.3.3)  develops  while  either  hemostatic  device  is in place  and is successfully  treated  without  altering  the 
weaning  protocol  of either  device  (i.e. the need  for reinflation  of air upon  weaning  the TR Band  or manual  
recompression  of the QuikClot  Radial  pad after the initial  5 minute  hold),  this will be considere d successful  
hemostasis.  
3.2.2.  Total  time to hemostasis : Total  time to hemostasis  will be calculated  as the time needed  from  sheath  removal  
to achieving  complete  hemostasis,  as described  below:  
For the QuikClot  Radial  pad + Coban ™ bandage   arm, total time to hemostasis  includes  the initial  5 

15 
Version  5. Dec 22, 2019  
 
  
 minutes  of manual  compression  and 25 minutes  of light compression  with the Coban ™ bandage , and plus a ny 
additional protocol directed recompression  time needed to obtain complete hemostasis . 
F o r  t h e  QuikClot  Radial  pad + TR band  arm, total time to hemostasis includes the initial 30 minutes of 
compression plus 1 minute of weaning, and any  additional  protocol  directed  recompression  and/or  weaning  
times  needed  to obtain  complete  hemostasis.  
For the standard  of care TR Band  arm, total time to hemostasis  includes  the initial  60 minutes  of compression  plus 
60 minutes  of weaning,  plus any  additional  protocol  directed  recompression  and/or  weaning  time needed to obtain  
complete  hemostasis.  
3.3. Secondary  Study  Endpoint  
3.3.1.  Radial  artery  occlusion  (RAO):  RAO  will be assessed  one to t wo  hours after completed  hemostasis,  
using  the reverse  Barbeau’s  test.20 Completed  hemostasis  in the TR Band  cohort  will be after the device  is 
removed  and the puncture  site is covered  with a Band -Aid or a dry gauze pad under  a Tegaderm ™ dressing  
without  further  bleeding/oozing  from  the access  site or development  of a forearm  hematoma.  Completed  
hemostasis  in the QuikClot  Radial  pad/Coban ™ cohort  is defined  as no further  bleeding/oozing  or 
development  of a forea rm hematoma  after the Coban ™ bandage  is removed  and the QuikClot  Radial  pad is 
secured  with a Tegaderm ™ dressing . Completed hemostasis  in the QuikClot /TR Band  cohort  will be after 
the TR Band® is removed without  further  bleeding/oozing  at the access  site or development  of a forearm  
hematoma.  RAO  is evaluated  one to two hours  after completed  hemostasis  based  on previous  findings  which  
demonstrated  the highest  incidence  of RAO  immediately  after band  removal.11 
3.3.2.  Patient  comfort/pain:  Patients  will be asked  to rate their comfort  level  associated  with the hemostatic  device  
they have been  assigned.  A verbal  numeric  rating  scale  (VNRS)  will be utilized  to evaluate  patient  comfort  with 
each device.  This scale  will use a [ADDRESS_354210] prior  to assessment  
of radial  artery  patency  with the reverse  Barbeau’s  test.[ADDRESS_354211]  the patient’s  response.  
3.3.3.  Access  site complications:  Complications  related  to the device  will be followed  up to resolution  or discharge,  
whichever  comes first. Research  staff will observe  and record  bleeding  and hematomas  that occur  related  to the 
access  site. The severity  of bleeding  and forearm  hematoma  will be recorded  using  the criteria  of the Early  
Discharge  after Transradial  Stenting  of Coronary  Arteries  (EASY)  classification.[ADDRESS_354212] Selection  and Withdrawal  
4.1. Inclusion Criteria  
1. Patients  undergoing  CC and/or  PCI via the radial  artery  as part  of their standard  of care treatment  
2. Patients  able and willing  to give written  informed  consent  
3. Patient  > [ADDRESS_354213] segment  elevation  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI)  
2. Oral anticoagulation  therapy  as described  below:  
a. If on a DOAC  (direct  acting  oral anticoagulants  – ie dabigatran,  rivaroxaban,  api[INVESTIGATOR_3822],  endoxaban),  
patients  will be excluded  if DOAC  taken  within  48 hours  and eGFR  > 30 ml/min  or DOAC  taken  
within  72 hours  and eGFR < 30 ml/min.  
b. If patient  is on warfarin,  excluded  if INR > 1.[ADDRESS_354214] procedure  
5. Major  unanticipated  event  in the cardiac  cath lab (i.e. cardiac  arrest)  of an already  consented  patient,  but 
before  randomization,  where  the operator  believes  participation  in this trial is now inappropriate.  
17 
Version  5. Dec 22, 2019  
 
  
  
6. Thrombo cytopenia,  with a platelet  count  of < 75,000.  
4.3. Subject  Recruitment  and Screening  
All eligible  subjects  undergoing  transradial  coronary  procedures  from  our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290344].  The subjects  will be asked in the pre-procedural  unit if they wish to participate  in 
this study  comparing  the two FDA  approved  hemostatic  devices  at the completion  of their radial  artery  access  
procedure.  The investigator  or his qualified  designee  will then obtain  written  informed  consent  according  to ICH 
GCP  (International  Conference  on Harmonization  Good  Clinical  Practice).  The completed  consent  forms  will be 
retained  by [CONTACT_80373] a  copy  of the consent  form  will be provided  to the study  participant.  
4.4. Method  for Assignin g Subjects  to Treatment  Groups  
Subjects  undergoing  CC and/or  PCI via the radial  artery  as part  of their standard  of care treatment,  and who have 
signed  informed  consent,  will be randomized  in the cardiac  cath lab upon  completion  of their procedures.  The 
REDCap  randomization  tools  will be used to facilitate  randomization.  A statistician  will create  a random  
allocation  table  (randomization  list) that will be uploaded  into the REDCap  project.  The statistician  will generate  
the random  allocation  table  according  to study  design  specifications  as determined  by [CONTACT_290372].  Participants  will be randomized  when  the research  coordinator  enters  a participant’s  REDCap  record  
and clicks  the “Randomize”  button  before  sheath  removal  by [CONTACT_099].  Clicking  this button  triggers  REDCap  
to check  the allocation  table  and display  the group  to which  the participant  should  be randomly  assigned.  This 
assignment  is permanent  and not editable  within  the participant’s  record  and, like all other  activity within  
REDCap,  is tracked  and not modifiable  in the audit  log. All subjects randomized into the old arm 3 
(QuikClot /Tegaderm ™) by [CONTACT_290373] s, and all screen failed subjects per this 
amended protocol will be assigned int o the n ew arm 3 (QuikClot /TR Band ), and a data collection instrument 
for the new arm 3 will be developed and added to the REDCap for this trial.  
4.5. Compliance  Monitoring  
The protocol  will be monitored  for compliance  by [CONTACT_45822]  [INVESTIGATOR_290345]  (OHR)’s  Monitoring  and Compliance  Officer.  The task of the study  monitor  is to guarantee  the 
best conduct  of the study  through  frequent  contacts  by [CONTACT_290374]/specialist,  in accordance  with the Monitor's  Operating  Procedures,  with the purpose  of facilitating  
the work  and fulfilling  the objectives  of the study.  
The QuikClot  Radial  pad compression  device  and Coban ™ bandages will  be stored  in a locked  area and 
access  will be limited  to the research  team.  The QuikClo t Radial  pad compression  device  and Coban ™ 
bandages  will be only used as described  in this trial. Subjects will  receive  the QuikClot  Radial   pad 
compression  device and  Coban ™ bandages  without  charge. 
5. Study  Procedures  
Participation  in the study  will involve  two clinical  visits  as follows:  
5.1. Visit  1 –At time of Standard  of Care Cardiac  Catheterization  and/or  PCI 
All subjects  will be closely  monitored  for bleeding  from  the radial  artery  access  site. Mon itoring  will be continued  
until complete  hemostasis  from  the radial  artery  has been achieved.  Use of reapplication  of the QuikClot  Radial  
pad or a TR band  will be at the discretion  of the investigator  if hemostasis  is not achieved  at the end of compress ion 
period.  One hour after complete  hemostasis,  the numeric  analog  pain scale  will be administered  and recorded  by 
18 
Version  5. Dec 22, 2019  
 
  
 the research  coordinator,  and then radial  artery  patency  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_290375]’s  test.20 
The research  coordinator  will then:  
• Schedule  a phone  call (or bedside  visit,  if applicable,  for those  subjects  still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  for Visit  2. 
• Instruct  the subject  to call the research  coordinator  the day after enrollment  to notify  the research  team  of 
any occurrence  of adverse  events  related  to the application  of either  device.  The subject  may leave  a 
message  on the research  coordinator’s  voicemail,  if the research  coordinator  is not able to answer  the 
telephone,  with their condition  and any adverse  event s. The voicemail  will be checked  daily.  For any 
perceived  serious  adverse  event  by [CONTACT_423],  they should  call the interventional  cardiologist  who 
performed  the procedure  or seek emergency  care.  
5.2. Visit  2-One day after  enrollment  
For subjects  who are still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  the research  coordinator  will visit the subjects  in their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290346],  to assess  the subject’s  condition  and adverse  events  related  to application  of either  
hemostatic  device.  For patients  who are already  at home  the day after their procedure,  the research  coordinator  will 
contact  [CONTACT_290376]’s  condition  and adverse  events  related  to 
application  of either  hemostatic  device.  If it is on weekend,  the research  coordinator  will contact  [CONTACT_290377]. For those  subjects  who cannot  be reached  by [CONTACT_290378],  the 
research  coordinator  will make  three  attempts,  once daily,  to reach  the subjects.  
6. Safety  and Adverse Events  
6.1. Definitions  
Adverse  Event:  An adverse  event  (AE)  is any symptom,  sign,  illness or experience  that develops  or worsens  in 
severity  during  the course  of the study.  Intercurrent  illnesses  or injuries  should  be regarded  as adverse  events.  
Abnormal  resul ts of diagnostic  procedures  are considered  to be adverse  events  if the abnormality:  
• results  in study  withdrawal  
• is associated  with a serious  adverse  event  
• is associated  with clinical  signs  or symptoms  
• leads  to additional  treatment  or to further  diagnostic  tests 
• is considered  by [CONTACT_290379]:  Adverse  events  are classified  as serious  or non-serious.   A serious  adverse  event  is any 
AE that is: 
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires  or prolongs  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836] 
• results in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• a congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
• an important  medical  event  
Important  medical  events  are those  that may not be immediately  life threatening,  but are clearly  of major  clinical  
significance.  They  may jeopardize  the subject,  and may require  intervention  to prevent  one of the other  serious  
outcomes  noted  above.   For example,  drug overdose   or  abuse,   a  seizure   that  did  not  result   in  in-patient  
[ADDRESS_354215]  be reported  is normally  defined  as the period  from  the initiation  
of any study  procedures  to the end of the study  treatment  follow -up. Only  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  will be 
reported  on for this study.  
Any adverse  event  that results  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290347] a serious  adverse  event  unless  specifically  instructed  otherwise  in this protocol.  Any condition  responsible  for 
surgery  should  be documented  as an adverse  event  if the condit ion meets  the criteria  for and adverse  event.  Neither  
the condition,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  nor surgery  are reported  as an adverse  event  in the 
following  circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290348] a 
preexisting  condition.  Surgery  should  not be reported  as an outcome  of an adverse  event  if the 
purpose  of the surgery  was elective  or diagnostic  and the outcome  was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290349].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290350],  unless  it is 
a worsening  or increase  in frequency  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_290351] . 
6.3. Recording  of Adverse  Events  
All serious  adverse  events  occurring  during  the study  period  must  be recorded.  The clinical  course  of each event  
should  be followed  until resolution,  stabilization,  or until it has been determined  that the study  treatment  or 
participation  is not the cause.  Serious  adverse  events  that are still ongoing  at the end of the study  period  must  be 
followed  up to determine  the final outcome.  
6.4. Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events  
Reports  of all serious  adverse  events  (including  follow -up information)  will be submitted  to the IRB within  10 
working  days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_290352]’s  binder.  The funding  sponsor  of QuikClot® Radial® pad will be notified  of serious  adverse  events  
related  to the device  (FDA  Medwatch  report).  
7. Data  Handling and Record  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
7.1. Confidentiality  
Information  about  study  subjects  will be kept confidential  and managed  according  to the requirements  of the Health  
Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  Act of 1996  (HIPAA).  Those  regulations  require  a signed  subject  
authorization  informing  the subject  of the following:  
• What  protected  health  information  (PHI)  will be collected  from  subjects  in this study  
• Who will have access  to that informa tion and why 
• Who  will use or disclose  that information  
• The rights  of a research  subject  to revoke  their authorization  for use of their PHI. 
In the event  that a subject  revokes  authorization  to collect  or use PHI, the investigator,  by [CONTACT_5151],  retains  the

7.2. Data Management  
Data  management  will be managed  by [CONTACT_290380].  Study  data will be collected  and 
managed  using  REDCap  electronic  data capture  tools  hosted  at OHR  of Memorial  Healthcare  System.  REDCap  
(Research  Electronic  Data Capture)  is a secure,  web-based  application  designed  to support  data capture  for research  
studies,  providing  1) an intuitive  interface  for validated  data entry;  2) audit  trails  for tracking  data manipulation  and 
export  procedures;  3) automated  export  procedures  for seamless  data downloads  to common  statistical  packages;  
and 4)  procedures  for importing  data from  external  sources.  . 
7.3. Sample  Size and Statistics  
Based  on the previous  study17 on the use of TR Band® and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_290353]  Radial  pad with 
either  a Coban ™ bandage  or Tegaderm ™ dressing  for radial  hemostasis,  we anticipate  an average  initial  
successful  hemostasis rate  of 95% or higher  in patients  using  the QuikClot  Radial  pad compression  device,  
compared  to an initial  successful  hemostasis  rate of 84% in patients  using  the TR Band , and no significant  
differences  between  the two QuikClot  Radial  pad arms.  Using  a type 1 error  of 0.05 for each of the two 
comparisons  of the QuikClot  Radial  pad with the TR Band  and power  of 80% to detect  an 11% difference  
in the rate of initial  successful  hemostasis between  the TR Band  arm and either  QuikClot  Radial  pad arm, a 
sample  size of 100 will be needed  for each of the three  arms  of the trial. Assuming  that there  may be a 50% 
screen  failure  rate (patients  withdraw,  ulnar  access  is used,  radial  access  failure,  events  occur  during  the 
procedure  that the investigator  does not wish to enter  the subject  or the diagnostic  only cases  of the study  are 
already  filled),  a total of up to 600 consecutive  subjects  undergoing  transradial  diagnostic  cardiac  catheterization  
and/or  PCI, who sign informed  consent  to participate,  will be recruited  into the three  arms  of the trial. 
An interim analysis was not originally planned for the study , but was conducted after enrolling  186 participants . 
The results obtained from the interim analysis showed that there was a failure to obtain initial hemostasis at 5 
minutes in approximat ely 30% of the subjects in the QuikClot /Tegaderm ™ arm of the protocol , compared to a 
failure to obtain initial hemostasis of 11% in the TR Band  cohort (odds ratio  = 3.2, 95% CI, 1.2 – 8.1, p = 0.013) 
and a failure to obtain initial hemostasis of  8% in the QuikClot /Coban ™ cohort (odds ratio = 4.7, 95% CI, 1.7 – 
12.1, p = 0.003).  Our DSMB committee reviewed the results and recommended to stop the Tegaderm ™ only 
arm. We here  institute a new arm 3 using a QuikClot  Radial  Pad under a TR Band  with [ADDRESS_354216]  (IRB)  within  
a reasonable  timeframe  after conclusion  of the study.

part 312 and International  Conference  on Harmonization  guidelines),  applicable  government  regulations  and 
Institutional  research  policies  and procedures.  
This proto col and any amendments  will be submitted  to a properly  constituted  IRB,  in agreement  with local  legal  
prescriptions,  for formal  approval  of the study  conduct.  The decision  of the IRB concerning  the conduct  of the study  
will be made  in writing  to the invest igator  and a copy  of this decision  will be provided  to the sponsor  before  
commencement  of this study.  The investigator  should  provide  a list of IRB members  and their affiliate  to the 
sponsor.  
All subjects  for this study  will be provided  a consent  form  describing  this study  and providing  sufficient  information  
for subjects  to make  an informed  decision  about  their participation  in this study.  The consent  form  will be submitted  
with the protocol  for review  and approval  by [CONTACT_14884].  The formal consent of a subject,  using  the IRB 
approved  consent  form,  must  be obtained  before  that subject  is submitted  to any study  procedure.  This consent  
form  must  be signed  by [CONTACT_423],  and the investigator -designated  research  professional  obtains  the consent.

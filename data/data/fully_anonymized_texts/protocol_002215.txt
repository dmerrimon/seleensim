Study Title:  Implementing a Paced Deep Breathing Module to Decrease Preoperative Anxiety in 
Gynecological Surgery Patients  
 
This study aims to reduce preoperative anxiety in patients undergoing gynecological surgery by 
[CONTACT_336399] a guided paced  deep breathing module introduced into the preoperative 
setting. If this intervention is successful in reducing patient anxiety, we plan to implement into 
practice the guided paced deep breathing module that every patient is offered preoperatively.

reduce pain, anxiety, and “tension -anxiety” in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].14,[ADDRESS_972088] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In this 
study, patients’ anxiety will be assessed pre -intervention on a [ADDRESS_972089] -intervention to gain more 
insight on the effectiveness of the intervention. The feasibility of the intervention in the busy 
preoperative setting will be evaluated by [CONTACT_58833] h ow many times a patient is interrupted while 
participating in the paced deep breathing module. If this module is found to be effective in 
reducing patients’ anxiety, it will be implemented into practice so that every patient is offered the 
module preoperat ively.  
 
Research Plan  
 
I. Background and Significance:  
 
Pre-operative anxiety is a common occurrence for many patients undergoing all 
types of surgery. Fears concerning the anesthesia process, fear of death or being cut, 
of a poor prognosis, fear of pain and no access to pain medications after the surgical 
procedure combined with fear of the unknown and loss of control all contribute to 
excess preoperative anxiety.1,[ADDRESS_972090] been shown to reduce pain, anxiety, and “tension -anxiety” in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].14,[ADDRESS_972091] an 
average anxiety rating of four on a zero to ten numeric rating scale.17  
 
II. Purpose of the Study:  
 
The purpose of this st udy is to evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic guided 
paced deep breathing module implemented into the preoperative setting of 
gynecological surgery to reduce patient anxiety. If this intervention is found to be 
effective, we plan to implement into practice the paced deep breathing module that 
every patient is offered preoperatively.  
 
III. Specific Aims of the Study:   
 
Primary A im: The study’s primary aim is to assess if utilizing an electronic paced 
deep breathing module administered in the preoperative setting can decrease a 
patient’s anxiety level prior to undergoing gynecological surgery. This study will 
determine if more research is needed or if the results are overwhelmingly positive in 
reducing anxiety, we plan to implement into practice the paced d eep breathing 
module that every patient is offered preoperatively.  
 
Secondary A im: The secondary aim of this study is to collect qualitative data 
regarding patient satisfaction with the paced deep breathing module.  
 
Tertiary Aim:  The tertiary aim of this s tudy is to evaluate the feasibility of 
implementing a paced deep breathing module into the busy preoperative setting of 
gynecological surgery.  
 
Hypothesis: In adult females undergoing gynecological surgery, the use of a 
preoperative electronic guided paced  deep breathing module will decrease anxiety 
levels.  
 
IV. Literature Review:  
 
The clinical practice question was used to guide the literature search. Preliminarily, 
PubMed was searched to determine if anxiety before surgery was, in fact, a problem. 
Key terms i ncluded perioperative period combined with anxiety or distress and 
outcomes or effects. Limitations included only articles that had been peer -reviewed 
and were available in English between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2015. 
Next, the clinical practice question was searched using databases: CINAHL, Embase, 
PubMed and PsycINFO covering a period of the last ten years, [ADDRESS_972092] -operatively.22,24 The types 
of surgery involved in the studies that offered a breathing intervention pre -operatively 
included trauma and orthopedic surgery19,22 including joint replacements,24 as well as 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806].25 
 
Of the outcomes measured in the breat hing intervention studies, the majority of 
studies included a primary outcome of anxiety,15,18 -25 or tension -anxiety13 as well as 
various secondary physiological outcomes such as systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and heart rate18,20,24. Other secondary  measures included pain,15, 19,22,24,25 self-
efficacy,19 fatigue ,13 sleep  satisfaction,22 and depression.21, 23 Scales used to measure 
the primary outcome of anxiety included Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996]’s State -Trait Anxiety Inventory -
State Scale,18,19,21,22,24 Visual Ana log Scales,15,24 the Beck Anxiety Inventory,25 the 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_713792]23 and numeric rating scales.20  
 
Similar research methods were utilized in many of the articles. The majority of 
studies, nine of ten, were well -designed single or multi -site randomi zed controlled 
trials,13,21,23 -25 or quasi -experimental trials15,18,19, 22 with a predominant Level of 
evidence at II or III. One Level IV study was found —a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].[ADDRESS_972093] -intervention, all but one 
found statistically significant reductions.15,19,22,24 Additionally, of the three studies 
also measuring physiological changes in outcomes such as systo lic and diastolic 
blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_713793].18,20,24  Statistically 
significant improvements were also seen in self -efficacy,19 fatigue,13 depression,21,23 
and sleep satisfaction22 in the intervention groups.  
 
Trends were seen supporting complementary integrative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713794], but r esults didn’t necessarily translate post -operatively. However, of the 
qualitative data that was collected, all comments and patient experiences were 
positive with no safety concerns that arose. Common themes were helpfulness of the 
intervention and induced  relaxation the patient felt after the intervention. 
Additionally, gender effects emerged with women reporting higher levels of anxiety 
preoperatively than males and relaxation techniques having a more profound effect on 
women than men.16,[ADDRESS_972094] been selected because of the gender effects observed in the literature.16-
18 
 
V. Theoretical Framework:   
 
The theoretical model being used f or this study is Herbert Benson’s relaxation 
response. The relaxation response is defined as physiological changes that are 
provoked by [CONTACT_7702] a relaxed position in a quiet environment, closing one’s eyes, 
engaging in repetitive mental action and passively ignoring distracting thoughts.[ADDRESS_972095] been associated with high levels of anxiety going into surgery.  
 
Additionally, the Neuman Systems Model  can be applied . “The Neuman Systems 
Model is a systemic perspective of health and w ellness, defined as the condition or 
the degree of system stability, that is, the condition in which all parts and subparts 
(variables) are in balance or harmony with the whole of the client/client system.”27, 
p.12 The model is based on the individual’s continuous relationship to environmental 
stress factors. These environmental stress factors have the potential to cause a 
reaction or a symptomatic reaction to stress thus affecting the client’s current health 
status.[ADDRESS_972096] -operatively, thus preoperatively treating the patient’s 
anxiety  with the deep breathing module will, in turn, positively benefit the patient’s 
health status.  
 
VI. Significance:  
 
Guided deep breathing has been found to be effective in reducing patient anxiety in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], including during the preoperative perio d. However, this will be 
the first study to implement a guided deep breathing focused intervention into the 
immediate  preoperative period for gynecological surgery patients to determine its 
effectiveness on reducing anxiety and evaluate patient satisfactio n. Currently, 
gynecological surgery does not offer any such intervention. This will be the first 
approach to reduce patients’ preoperative anxiety with a deep breathing intervention. 
This study has the potential to significantly add to the evidence and lit erature 
supporting the potential benefits of paced deep breathing exercises in the immediate 
preoperative setting. It will also provide a baseline for continued research on the 
benefits of paced deep breathing utilized in the immediate preoperative setting  in 
specialty practices other than gynecological surgery.  
 
VII. Methods:  
 
This is a study with a pre - and post -test quasi -experimental design. This study will 
specifically examine an electronic paced deep breathing module for adult female 
patients undergoing gynecological surgery in the preoperative setting. This pre/post -
test design was chosen to measure the primary outcome of anxiety level and gain 
patient’s feedback on the module, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing 
the module into the busy preoperative setting of gynecological surgery.  
 
a. Subjects and  setting:  
 
The study will be offered to a convenience sample of [ADDRESS_972097] (i.e. change in anxiety expressed in 
SD units), has ranged from 0.5 to 0.9.18,19  In general, for a one -sample study a 
sample -size of N=45 will provide statistical power (two -tailed, alpha=0.05) of 
90% to detect a change of 0.5 SD. Therefore a sample -size of N=45 is proposed.  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  Women aged 18 years or older undergoing gynecological 
surgery on Eisenberg 1 -4; English -speaking; Able to complete pre - and post -
intervention questionnaires; Able to read and understand informed consent form  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  Non-Engl ish speaking women; first -case of the day 
gynecological surgery patients  
 
b. Instruments and Data Collection (See Appendix):  
 
1. Rapid Anxiety Assessment Tool (RAAT) 0-10 numeric rating scale  
2. Qualitative questions regarding paced deep breathing module  
3. Demographic data collected on pre -intervention survey  
 
Baseline anxiety will be assessed upon admission to Eisenberg 1 -4 using the 
Rapid Anxiety Assessment Tool (RAAT) zero to ten numeric rating scale and 
demographic information will be collected. This too l has been validated in the 
literature and is a single -item numeric rating scale that provides a quick 
assessment of patients’ anxiety level.17 The to ol rates anxiety on a zero (no 
anxiety) to ten (worst anxiety possible) numeric scale and is easy for patients to 
use.17 The tool additionally has bee n correlated with Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2996]’s State -Trait 
Anxiety Inventory -State Scale with r=0.[ADDRESS_972098] twelve mo nths. After 
the intervention, anxiety will be assessed again using the RAAT numeric rating 
scale and qualitative questions regarding the module will be assessed. Data will be 
collected from paper questionnaires.  
Feasibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_713799].  
 
     c.   Procedures:  
Patients will be recruited by [CONTACT_61337] , Natalie Laska, RN, SRNA, 
and [CONTACT_713806], APRN, CNS, D.N.P. , as well as co -investigator, 
Heather Ondler Hinson,  by [CONTACT_713800] a research flyer (see appendix). 
Additionally, a surgical listing of patients undergoing gynecological surgery for 
each day will be obtained by [CONTACT_713801] -invest ogator . 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated to determine eligibility and eligible 
patients will be approached by [CONTACT_202287] /co-investigator  and asked 
if one is interested in participating in a deep breathing/meditation interventio n. 
The primary investigators /co-investigator will then provide information and 
instruction regarding the questionnaires and intervention module to the patient. 
The patient  will then be asked for verbal consent  and written signed HIPAA 
authorization  to participate.  Once consent is obtained, the primary 
investigators /co-investigator  will provide the patient with the questionnaire packet 
(including pre - and post -intervention questionnaires) as well as introduce and set 
up the module on an iPad or porta ble laptop for the patient. The paced deep 
breathing module consists of ten minutes of a guided breathing exercise while 
culminating a calm and energized mind. It was developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Amit Sood, 
M.D. and is entitled “Calm and Energize: A Meditation with Yo ur Breath.” The 
script for this meditation is led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sood and is as follows:  
“Calm and energize, a meditation with your breath. Let us settle ourselves 
in a quiet, safe and comfortable place. Start your practice by [CONTACT_713802] i s slowly waking up to the world. Notice the five 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_713795]. Notice their color —the shallow wrinkles on their 
surface and folded frilly edges (video of hibiscus flower opening is 
shown). Like this flower, imagine you have opened your heart to invit e 
hope and possibilities into your life. When you’re ready, gently close your 
eyes making sure your eyelids are only lightly touching each other. Now, 
gradually shift your attention to the rhythm of your breath. Observe the 
flow of your breath without tryi ng to change it in any way. Notice the 
subtle sensation of air flow under your nostrils as you breathe in fresh, 
cool air and breathe out air that is warmed by [CONTACT_713803]. Next, we will 
synchronize our breath to the two flute sounds. This is the sound for 
breathing in (pause for flute sound) and this is the sound for breathing out 
(pause for flute sound). Begin slow deep breathing synchronizing your 
breath to the two flute sounds. Inhale (flute), exhale (flute), inhale (flute), 
exhale (flut e), inhale (flute ), exhale (f lute). Make sure your eyes are 
relaxed with your eyelids only lightly touching each other and your face 
has a gentle smile.  Now we will calm and energize our heart. Follow your 
breath from the tip of your nose to the deepest place in your hear t. While 
breathing in, imagine your heart is recharging with calming, soothing 
energy. While breathing out, imagine your fatigue and hurt are all melting 
away. Inhale (flute), exhale (flute), inhale (flute), exhale (flute), inhale 
(flute), exhale (flute co ntinues without instruction).  Make sure your eyes 
are relaxed with your eyelids only lightly touching each other and your 
face has a gentle smile. Now, we will calm and energize our eyes. Follow 
your breath from the depth of your heart to both of your eye s. While 
breathing in, imagine your eyes are recharging with calming, soothing 
energy. While breathing out, imagine all the fatigue in your eyes is 
melting away. Inhale (flute), exhale (flute), inhale (flute), exhale (flute), 
inhale (flute), exhale (flute continues without instruction). Make sure your 
eyes are relaxed with your eyelids only lightly touching each other and 
your face has a gentle smile. Now, we will calm and energize our brain. 
Follow your breath from the depth of your heart to the farthest p laces in 
your brain. While breathing in, imagine your brain is recharging with 
calming, soothing energy. While breathing out, imagine all the fatigue in 
your brain is melting away. Inhale (flute), exhale (flute), inhale (flute), 
exhale (flute), inhale (flu te), exhale (flute continues without instruction ). 
Make sure your eyes are relaxed with your eyelids only lightly touching 
each other and your face has a gentle smile (flute continues). Now, think 
about one person you know who truly cares about you. Bring that person’s 
face in front of your eyes, and then send that person your silent gratitude. 
Imagine that person is being protected for the week with the energy you 
just sent. We will now transition out of the meditation practice. Give 
yourself a nice stretc h, set a positive intention for the rest of the day, and 
then when you’re ready you can open your eyes. I hope you have a 
wonderful day.”  
During this time, the patient will be left alone with the door shut and lights 
dimmed.  Family present in the room wil l be welcome to stay. A door card will be 
placed outside the room to minimize interruptions during this time. At the 
completion of the module, a second anxiety score using the RAAT numeric rating 
scale will be collected and a short questionnaire will be co mpleted (see appendix). 
A nurse on Eisenberg [ADDRESS_972099] the completed questionnaire packet from 
each participating patient, to reduce bias, and bring to the primary 
investigators /co-investigator  for secure filing. Information as to whether the 
patien t received a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_713796]’s medication administration record. Prior to the implementation 
of the study, nurses on Eisenberg [ADDRESS_972100] the completed questionnaire packets and bring them 
to primary investigators /co-investigator . All study materials will be kept in a 
secured file by  [CONTACT_202287] /co-investigator . Data analysis will be 
performed by [CONTACT_713804], RN, SRNA, with assistance from the statistician, 
Darrell Schroeder.  
 
The only potential risk factor foreseen is emotional harm by [CONTACT_713805] g the questionnaires. If a patient chooses not to participate or end 
participation early, his or her care will not be compromised.  
 
      d.   Data Analysis:  
 
Subject characteristics will be summarized using mean±SD for continuous 
variables and frequency c ounts and percentages for categorical variables. The 
primary outcome for this study will be anxiety which will be assessed pre - and 
post-intervention using RAAT (0 -10 numeric rating scale). The change from pre - 
to post -intervention will be assessed using t he paired t -test (or signed rank test).  
Results from the short post -intervention survey will be summarized using 
methods appropriate for  qualitative data collection including content analysis 
dividing responses into meaning units, condensing these and int erpreting the 
underlying meaning to identify sub -themes and themes.28 
 
     e.   Limitations:  
 
 This is a study with no control group  using a convenience sample  
 Small sample size  
 Limited generalizability  
 
VIII.  Human Subjects Consideration:  
 
a. Potential Risks:  
 
The potential risks of this research study are minimal. In previous studies utilizing 
deep breathing practices, no side effects were observed. There is no compromise 
to present or future care if the patients refuse the offer of the paced deep breathing 
intervention or if the intervention is  stopped early.  Patients will be given  the 
option to stop the intervention  at any time if they have concerns or feel 
uncomfortable.  
 
b. Protection:  
 
We will adhere to HIPAA regulations and protect the privacy and confidentiality 
of the patients involved from recruitment, intervention , and analysis of data.  If at 
any time a participating patient exhibits signs of distress, the subject will then be 
given the choice to either continue or discontinue with the paced de ep breathing 
intervention. All study participants will be given a unique ID code separate from 
their MC number and all data will be kept in a secured file and secure electronic 
server.  
 
c. Gender/minority Mix:  
 
English as the primary language  is a necessity for this small sample size study due 
to the nature of excluding the need for an interpreter to interpret the pre- and post -
intervention questionnaires.

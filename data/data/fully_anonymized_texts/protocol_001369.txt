Page 121. INTRODUCTION
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a neuroendocrine hormone that is predominantly 
released from the small intestine in response to food intake.1  GLP-1 activation of the GLP-1
receptor (GLP-1R) stimulates insulin release, inhibits glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, and delays gastric emptying.
2,3Several injectable peptidic 
GLP-1R agonists are approved for the treatment of Type [ADDRESS_1105856] that 
is approved both for the treatment of obesity (known as Saxenda®)5and for the treatment of 
Type 2 diabetes (known as Victoza).6  
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the variability and operating characteristics of 
food (energy) intake in non-diabetic, obese subjects using liraglutide, an agent that has been demonstrated to result in decreased food intake.  This assessment will aid in determining if food intake is an appropriate decision-making endpoint 
1.1. Mechanism of Action/Indication
Liraglutide is a specific and potent GLP-1R agonist that is approved at doses up to 3.0 mg for 
the treatment of chronic weight management in adult subjects with body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m
2(obese) or >27 kg/m2body mass index (BMI) (overweight) with weight-related 
co-morbidities as adjunct with reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity,5or at 
doses up to 1.8 mg to improve glycemic control in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.6
For this study, liraglutide is being used as a research tool to assess the performance characteristics of food intake as a primary endpoint in obese subjects.
1.2. Background 
Obesity is a chronic disease that is associated with serious co-morbidities including type 2 
diabetes mellitus, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, atherosclerosis, obstructive sleep apnea and certain cancers.
7  Obesity is also associated with increased all-cause mortality.8  The 
prevalence of obesity is estimated at greater than 35% of the [LOCATION_002] (US) population and poses a major public health challenge.
[ADDRESS_1105857] line treatment for obesity is lifestyle 
intervention including diet, exercise and behavioral therapy.  While effective in many patients, lifestyle intervention is often not sustainable, and many patients regain weight after initial weight loss.
10  Pharmacotherapy has been approved by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA) for long-term treatment of obesity and can be a useful adjunct to lifestyle intervention that helps augment and maintain weight loss.
GLP-[ADDRESS_1105858]-prandially that improves appetite regulation 
and glucose metabolism.  The half-life of endogenous GLP-1 in vivo is exceptionally short at approximately 1 to 2 minutes, due to cleavage by [CONTACT_801124].
11,12  Liraglutide is 
a long acting GLP-1 analog with 97% amino acid homology to native GLP-1 and a half-life of approximately 13 hours,
13making it suitable for once daily dosing.14  Liraglutide lowers 
blood glucose in a glucose-dependent manner by [CONTACT_801125]-1Rs.
15Liraglutide also delays CCI

Page 13gastric emptying, reduces food intake, and suppresses appetite leading to weight loss.  This 
anorectic action is proposed to be mediated by [CONTACT_801126]-1R in appetite centers of the brain.
16,17,18
Liraglutide has been evaluated in many clinical trials, in both subjects with Type 2 diabetes 
and non-diabetic subjects with obesity.  The clinical development program for Saxenda
included 5 double-blind, placebo controlled trials in 3384 overweight or obese subjects for a 
mean treatment duration of 45.9 weeks (range 32 to 56 weeks duration).[ADDRESS_1105859] meal (ad libitum lunch) was reduced by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_1105860] common adverse events reported with Saxendawere nausea (in 
39% of subjects), diarrhea (in 21% of subjects), constipation (in 19% of subjects), and vomiting (in 16% of subjects).  The percentage of subjects reporting nausea declined as treatment continued, and most of the gastrointestinal adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity.  The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were 
nausea (2.9% versus 0.2% for Saxenda
and placebo, respectively), vomiting (1.7% versus 
less than 0.1%), and diarrhea (1.4% versus 0%).5
Additional information for liraglutide can be found in the Single Reference Safety Document 
(SRSD), which for this study is the Saxendalabel.[ADDRESS_1105861] acetaminophen (administered as a challenge agent) will be its label.19
1.3. Rationale 
1.3.1. Study Rationale 
This study is designed to assess the performance characteristics of energy intake as a 
biomarker for anorexiant agents in obese subjects.  Study subjects will be randomized toreceive either liraglutide dosed up to 3.0 mg daily or placebo during 6 weeks of dosing.  Additional goals of this study include:
To assess the variability and operating characteristics in study measures related to 
food intake, including gastric emptying, appetite, and satiety, with an agent that has 
been demonstrated to impact these endpoints.
To provide a mid-point assessment at 3 weeks that will assess food intake as an early 
signal of efficacy

Page 14To create an internal database for energy intake and related assessments, such as 
tolerability, gastric emptying, appetite, satiety  
This study will enroll non-diabetic obese subjects who may be treated for co-existing 
conditions, such as hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_110240], but who are otherwise clinically stable.  
The study population is chosen in accordance with the Saxendaprescribing instructions,[ADDRESS_1105862] no intention of 
becoming pregnant during the study, in accordance with the Saxenda
prescribing 
instructions.5
Subjects in this study will be randomized to receive either liraglutide (administered from 
Saxendapens) or placebo (0.9% normal saline administered subcutaneously) for [ADDRESS_1105863] blinding techniques are being utilized in this study, as neither the investigator site 
nor the Sponsor has access to a placebo device that matches Saxenda
pens.  Although an 
imperfect blinding approach is being utilized, blinding was deemed an essential component 
of the study design, as perception of appetite and satiety can be affected by [CONTACT_801127].  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_801128], as subjects with lower baseline weight may demonstrate higher drug levels of liraglutide and greater degrees of weight loss than subjects with higher baseline body weight at the same dose of 3.[ADDRESS_1105864] on body weight and associated variability, subjects will complete a Run-in visit (V2) prior to the initial inpatient visit (V3) to stabilize food intake and body weight. 
In addition to assessing changes in energy intake and body weight with liraglutide, this study 
will generate an internal dataset of endpoints relevant to liraglutide-induced weight loss, including gastric emptying (measured by [CONTACT_801129] [PK]concentrations after acetaminophen administration) and assessment of appetite and satiety(measured by [CONTACT_51021] [VAS] questionnaire).   
 
Energy intake will be measured over a period of [ADDRESS_1105865] in the individual level data available in the literature, as CCICCI

Page 15published studies were completed in separate, small study populations, with varying dose 
ranges of liraglutide explored.  This study seeks to fill those gaps by [CONTACT_801130], electrocardiogram (ECG), standard safety labs and 
adverse events, amylase, lipase and calcitonin will be assessed at baseline and during the 
study in accordance with the Saxenda
prescribing instructions.5  Assessment of Suicidal 
Ideation and Behavior (SIB) by [CONTACT_159940] (C-SSRS)21and
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)22will also be performed in accordance with the 
Saxendaprescribing instructions.5Furthermore, in light of a prior study demonstrating 
increases in diastolic blood pressure with short-term liraglutide administration,23subjects will 
receive frequent blood pressure assessments at similar time points  
Banked biospecimens will be collected for the purpose of conducting research; specific uses 
are described in the Banked Biospecimens section.  Comparing the deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein, and metabolite variation patterns of subjects who respond well and those who respond poorly to treatment may help to better define the most appropriate group of subjects in which to target a given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens for exploratory pharmacogenomic/genomic/biomarker analyses and retaining them in the Biospecimen Banking System (BBS) make it possible to better understand the investigational product’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, tolerability, safety, and/or efficacy not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study. 
Banked biospecimens retained in the BBS may also be used in research on obesity. Providing these biospecimens is a required study activity for study sites and subjects, unless 
prohibited by [CONTACT_168047] (EC) decision. 
1.3.2. Dose Rationale
Liraglutide will be administrated subcutaneously in accordance with the Saxenda

prescribing instructions for a total of 6 weeks, with an initial dose of 0.6 mg per day and 
increasing by 0.6 mg in weekly intervals  until a dose of 3.0 mg per day is reached.5To 
ensure blinded status throughout the study, placebo (0.9% normal saline) will be administered subcutaneously via syringe in matching volume for [ADDRESS_1105866] dosing with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours, making liraglutide suitable for once daily administration.  Liraglutide exposure increases proportionally in the dose range of 0.6 mg to 3 mg and is considered similar among three subcutaneous injection sites (upper arm, abdomen, and thigh).  Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (greater than 98%), and is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination.

Subjects will be randomized into the study prior to dosing of IP on Day 1 (V3), provided they 
have satisfied all subject eligibility criteria outlined in the Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion 
Criteria sections of this protocol. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized prior to the first dose of IP to either liraglutide or 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  A computer-generated randomization schedule will be used to assign subjects to the treatment groups using the 1:1 allocation ratio stratified by [CONTACT_801132] 
V3 (100 kg or <100 kg). An attempt will be made to balance the number of subjects 
assigned to receive liraglutide and placebo within each stratum.
4.4. Lifestyle Requirements
4.4.1. Meals and Dietary Restrictions
Subjects must abstain from all food and drink (except water) at least 8, but preferably 
10 hours, prior to any fasting blood sample collections for clinical laboratory tests, glucose, and insulin assessments.
Water may be consumed as desired.
 
 
For the food intake assessment, the menus for each meal during the 48 hour period 
comprising the assessment will be identical across all assessments in the study. 
During inpatient visits, the total daily nutritional composition should be 
approximately 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 15% protein. 
During run in period (between V2 and V3) and home dosing (ie between V3 and V4
and between V4 and V5), subjects will be instructed to maintain usual dietary intake.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Breakfast (Fixed Kilocalorie) Meal
An identical fixed kcal breakfast (approximately 500 kcal) will be provided to study subjects 
at the time points listed in the Schedule of Activities .  The breakfast meal is standardized to 
minimize any variability in food intake assessment of the succeeding ad libitum lunch and dinner meals and .  Breakfast will be timed so that subjects start the meal at approximately 07:[ADDRESS_1105880] is unable to do so, this will be recorded as a protocol deviation.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Ad Libitum Meals
Ad libitum meals will be served to study subjects for lunch and dinner at the time points
listed in the Schedule of Activities .  Subjects will be instructed to consume their meals within 
30 minutes with a reminder notification at 25 minutes after initiation of meal ingestion.  C

activity .
4.4.4. Contraception
In this stud y, fertile male subjects and female subjects who are of childbearing potential will 
receive placebo or liraglutide , which has been associated with demonstra ted 
teratogenicit y/fetotoxicity  in nonclinical studies.5  Subjects who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use
2meth
ods of highly  effective contraception throughout the study  and for at least [ADDRESS_1105881] and his or herpartner (s)from the list of permitted 
contraception methods (see below) and will confirm 
that the subject has been instructed in 
their consistent and correct use.  At time points indica ted in the Schedule of A ctivities, the 
investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use 2highl y effective methods 
of contraception consistently  and correctly and document the conversation, and the subject’s 
affirmation, 
in the subject’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the 
subject to call immediately  if 1or both of the selected contraception method sis discontinued 
or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subject or partner . 

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 24Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of con traception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg,oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal ),provided the subject or 
male subject’s female partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the 
entire study and has been using that hormo nal contraceptive for an adequate period of 
time to ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD).
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a separate spermicide product (ie, foam, 
gel, film, cream, or suppository ).  Forcountries where spermicide is not available or 
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option 
is not appropriate.
4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the postvasectomy  ejaculate. 
5.Bilateral tubal ligation/bil ateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).
All sexually  active male subjects must agree to prevent potential transfer to and exposure of 
partner(s) to dru g through ejaculate b y using a condom consistently  and correctl y, beginning 
with the first dose of investigational product and continuing for at least [ADDRESS_1105882].

Page 255.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH)
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference /comparator in a clinical study , 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33).
For this study , the investigational products are:
Liraglutide, administered subcutaneousl y via pen injection with dose titration to 
3.0mg daily  per Saxendaprescribing instructions;5
Placebo, 0.9% weight/volume ( w/v) sodium chloride, [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia 
(USP), administered subcutaneousl y via s yringe injection with matching volume to 
liraglutide dose.
In addition, during each of 
the inpatient study  visits (V3, V4, V5), a non -investigational 
medicinal product ( acetaminophen 1.5 g) willbe administered as a challenge agent for the 
assessment of gastric emptying (see Gastric Empty ingsection) .
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
The investigator will assign subject numbers to the subjects as they  are screened for the 
study .  [COMPANY_007] will provide a randomization schedule to the investigator and, in accordance 
with the randomization numbers, the subject will receive the study  treatment regimen 
assigned to the corresponding randomization number. 
Subjects will be stratified into the stud y according to body  weight at V3 .  Once stratified, 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1105883] and the unbl inded administrator(s), study  site and sponsor personnel who are 
directly  involved in the study  conduct will be blinded to the randomization schedule.  The 
only exception will be in the event of an emerging safet y issue which requires breaking the 
blind (s ee Breaking the Blind section).

orally  as a challenge agent to assess gastric emp tying during inpatient visits.  Acetaminophen 
will be drawn into a s yringe by  [CONTACT_801135].
5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing
Within this protocol, preparation refers to the investigator site activities performed to make 
the investigational product read y for administration or dispensing to the subject by  [CONTACT_216479].  Dispensing is defined as the provision of investigational product, concomitant 
treatments, and accompany ing information by [CONTACT_22806](s) to a subject in 
accordance with this protocol.  L ocal health authority  regulations or 
investigator site 
guidelines may  use alternative terms for these activities.
Liraglutide and placebo will be prepared b y qualified unblinded s ite personnel according to 
the IP manual and administered in blinded fashion to the subject.  IP should be prepared and 
dispensed by  [CONTACT_274234] 
(eg,physician, nurse, phy sician’s assistant, nurse pr actitioner, pharmacy assistant/technician,

Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 275.5.Administration
Designated and trained study staff administering blinded I P to subjects will be unblinded and 
will be separate from the study  team who will be blinded.  Liraglutide will be administered 
from a 3mL Saxendapen.24  Dosing with the Saxendapen is controlled by  [CONTACT_801136] (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 clicks).
  One 
click equals 0.06 mg.
Daily  subcutaneous injections of placebo or liraglutide will b e administered in the abdomen, 
thigh or upper arm by [CONTACT_801137] (for 
dosing periods between V3 and V4 and between V4 and V5) andin the CRU during inpatient 
study  visits (V3, V4 and V5, as detailed in the Schedule of Activities). For Day [ADDRESS_1105885]’s home or at inpatient CRU by  [CONTACT_801138].  The site of subcutaneous injection may  vary  during the study  but 
should be administered at one of the sites listed above and according to the Saxenda 
medication guide
.24A 31 gauge pen needle will be used with the Saxendapen, and a 
31gauge insulin sy ringe will be used to administe r placebo.24The unblinded administrator 
will be instructed to perform an air shot before the first injection with the Saxendapen24or 
placebo s yringe and will pre pare the dose of blinded I P in a separate location away  from the 
subject . Subjects will be blindfolded during administration to maintain blinding to the I P.
As per the Saxendalabel,5and in order to reduce th e number of side effects, liraglutide will 
be initiated at a dose of 0.[ADDRESS_1105886] ions, the volume of saline administered for a specific week of dosing will match the 
volume specified in the “Volume Administered” column in Table 3.  If a subject does not 
tolerate the next dose level during dose escalation, as d etermined b y the Investigator, d ose 
escalation to the next higher dose will be delay ed by  [CONTACT_185883].  All subjects who are able to 
tolerate a minimum dose of liraglutide 1.[ADDRESS_1105887] 2 weeks prior

5.5.1. Timing of Administration during Inpatient Visits (V3, V4, V5)
During the inpatient visits to the CRU (V3, V4, and V5), subjects will receive IPat 
approximatel y 07:00 hours (plus or minus 60 minutes).  Designated unblinded i nvestigator 
site personnel wi ll administer IP and will be separate from the stud y team who will be 
blinded. 

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 285.5.2. Timing of Home Administration (between V3 and V4, and between V4 and V5)
To allow for additional flexibility  in the timing of IP administration at home between V3 and 
V4 and be tween V4 and V5, the time chosen for daily  administration of IP may  be 
determined b y the subject and designated unblinded administrator
.  Once this time is chosen, 
doses of I P should be administered by  a designated unblinded administrator at approximatel y 
the same time each day  (plus or minus 2 hours) without regard to the timing of meals. 
5.6.Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator or an approved representative, 
eg,pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured ar ea with controlled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements .
Investigational product sshould be stored in their original container sand in accordance with 
the label s. 
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated ,and/or room -temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available .  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperat ure is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the min imum/maximum
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature -monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they aremaintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product -label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to thestorage 
conditions described in the labeling , as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be docu mented and reported to [COMPANY_007] . 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a 
protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after the 
temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excu rsion will be provided to the site. 
5.7. Investigational Product Accountability
The investigat or site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.  All investigational product s will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record.

investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
[CONTACT_4618] ,and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
5.8.Concomitant Treatment s
Subjects in this study will be allowed to take certain concomitant medications to treat 
coexisting conditions such as hy perlipi[INVESTIGATOR_110246].  Attempts must be made not
to alter the doses and regimens of chronic background medications after randomization and 
for the duration of participation in this study .  All concomitant treatments taken during the 
study  must be recorded with indication, daily  dose, and start and stop dates of administration.   
All subjects will be questioned about concomitant treatment sat each study visit, and any  
changes must be captured in the CRF .
Treatments taken within [ADDRESS_1105889] dose of IPwill be documen ted as concomitant 
treatment s.
5.8.1. Anti -Hypertensive Medications
Use of background antihy pertensive agent(s) is permitted (unless noted in Exclusion 
Criteria ).  Doses of antihy pertensive agen ts should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to V2 .  
Changes to therap y or doses during the duration of the study  should be avoided, if possible.
5.8.2. Lipid -Modifying Medications
Use of lipid-modify ing agent(s) is permitted (unless noted below in Exclusion Criteria ).  
Doses of lipid
-modify ing agents should be stable for at least 4weeks prior t oV2.  Changes to 
therap y or doses should be avoided during the study , if possible.

6. STUDY PROCEDURES
6.1. Chronology of Procedures
During the inpatient visits (V3, V4, and V5), for the procedures described below, where 
multiple procedures are scheduled at the same time point(s) relative to dosing, the following chronology of events should be adhered to , where possible
:
12-lead ECG: obtain prior to vital sign measurements and as close as possible to the 
scheduled time, but prior to blood specimen collection (refer to Electrocardiogram
section);
Blood pressure and pulse rate: obtain as close as possible to the scheduled time, but 
prior to blood specimen collection (refer to Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate section);
Ifan intravenous catheter is placed for serial blood sample collections, ECGs and 
vital sign (pulse rate, BP) assessments should be collected either prior to the insertion 
of the catheter orafter sufficient rest period after catheter insertion to minimize
impact of catheter placement on these assessments;
Fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory tests: after assessment of 12-lead ECG 
and blood pressure and pulse rate but prior to start of meal and/or dosing of IP (refer 
toLaboratory Tests section);
Fasting sample for acetaminophen PK should occur prior to start of meal, dosing of 
acetaminophen and dosing of IP;
If the blood collection nominal time coincides with the nominal time of a meal, these 
blood samples should be collected prior to start of the meal.
Dosing (refer to Administration section): should occur as close as possible to the
scheduled nominal time with or without a meal;
Other procedures: obtain all other procedures as close as possible to the scheduled 
time, but may be obtained before or after blood specimen collection.C

Page 326.5.Follow -Up(V6 and Phone Contact)
In this stud y, there are twoFollow -up visits, as follow s: 
The first is an on -site visit where the subjects will return to the investigator site
103days following the last dose of investigational product;
The second is a telephone contact [CONTACT_772968] 313days following the last dose of 
investigational product;
Refer to 
Schedule of Activities Table 1for the study  procedures to be completed at 
each of the two Follow -up visits.
6.6.Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety  (see also the 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given investigator site.  The earl y termination visit applies only to subjects 
who are randomized , receive at least one dose of IP and then are prematurely  withdrawn 
from the study .
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  The investigator or site staff should attempt to contact [CONTACT_110280].  After 
2attempts, CRU staff may send a registered letter.  If no response is received from the 
subject, the subject will be considered lost to follow- up.  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_110281]’s 
medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort should be made to document subject 
outcome, if possible.  The investigator sho uld inquire about the reason for withdrawal , 
request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject 
regarding an y unresolved adverse events ( AEs).
It may  be appropriate forthe subject to return to the clinic for f inal safet y assessments to be 
scheduled as earl y as practically feasible following the decision to withdraw from the stud y.  
Subjects should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal.  At the earl y withdrawal 
visit, every  effort must be made to c omplete the a ssessments to be performed at the onsite 
Follow up visit ( see Table 1of Schedule of Activities ).
Lack of completion of all or an y of the withdrawal/earl y termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the subject’s safet y was preserved.
If the subject withdraws from the study  and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Subjects who withdraw from the study  may  be replaced at the discretion of the investigator 
upon consultation with the sponsor .

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 33Withdrawal of Consen t: 
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment will remain in the study  and 
must continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures.  The only  
exception to this is when a subject specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact 
[CONTACT_310799].   
Subjects should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from 
future follow -up, whenever possible.   The withdrawal of consent should be explained in 
detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only from 
further receipt of investigational product or also from study  procedures and/or post treatment 
study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.   In the event that vital status 
(whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  available information 
should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in accordance with 
local law.
Lost to 
Follow-up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow- up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084].  All 
attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record s.  If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of 
death.
  If the investigator’s use of a third- party representative to assist in the follow -up 
portion of the study  has been incl uded in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator 
may use a sponsor -retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the 
subject’s contact [CONTACT_110284] -
up portion of the study .  The site staff and representative will consult publicly  
available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated 
contact [CONTACT_3031].   If,
after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow-up, then the 
last-known
-alive date as determined by  [CONTACT_8876]’s medical records.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.   However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to perform 
the test.  I n these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary  to ensure the safet y and
well-being of the subject.  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for the missed test and an y corrective and preventive 
actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered t o as soon as 
possible.  The study  team must be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.

Page 35Subjects will complete urine drug testing during each inpatient stay per the Schedule 
of Activities .  Additional unscheduled urine drug testing may be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Drug testing conducted prior to dosing must be negative during each inpatient stay for subjects to continue dosing withinvestigational product. 
Blood samples  
at the pre-specified nominal 
time points outlined in Table 2 of the Schedule of Activities and analyzed at the study 
site. Samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) relative to baseline laboratory samples will not be captured as a protocol deviation, as long as the exact time of the sample collection is noted on the source document and data collection tool (eg, CRF/DCT).
Any remaining serum/plasma from samples collected for clinical laboratory measurements at 
baseline and at all times after dose administration may be retained and stored for the duration of the study.  Upon completion of the study, these retained safety samples may be used for the assessment of exploratory safety biomarkers or unexpected safety findings.  These data will not be included in the clinical study report (CSR).  Samples to be used for this purpose will be shipped to either a [COMPANY_007]-approved Biospecimen Banking System (BBS) facility or other designated laboratory and retained for up to [ADDRESS_1105894] 25 mIU/mL 
and must be performed by a certified laboratory.  For female subjects of childbearing potential, [ADDRESS_1105895]([ADDRESS_1105896] at screening [V1] and [ADDRESS_1105897] administration [V3]).  Following a negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and the second negative pregnancy test result will then be required at the baseline visit and within [ADDRESS_1105898] day of the menstrual period (counting the first day of the menstrual period as Day 1) before the subject may receive the investigational product.  In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, the study candidate should have used [ADDRESS_1105899].  Pregnancy tests will also be performed at V2, V3, V4, V5 and at the end of the study (V6) to confirm that the subject has not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed and when potentialpregnancy is otherwise suspected, and may be repeated if requested by [CONTACT_801141] (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427]. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from administration of IP and from the study. 
7.1.3. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations may be conducted by a physician, trained physician's assistant, or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation.  A full physical examination will include head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, CCI
A9001498
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1105900]’s arm supported at the level of the heart, and 
recorded to the nearest mm Hg after approximately [ADDRESS_1105901].  The same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study. If an intravenous catheter is used for blood collection, BP should not be taken from the arm with an intravenous catheter.   Subjects should be instructed not to speak during measurements.
The same properly sized and calibrated BP cuff will be used to measure BP each time.  The 
use of an automated device for measuring BP and PR is acceptable; however, when done manually, PR will be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least [ADDRESS_1105902] 
10 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the investigator site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements.  If the QTc interval is increased by 45 msec from 
the baseline, or an absolute QTc value is 500 msec for any scheduled ECG, then 
2 additional ECGs will be collected, approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart, to confirm the 
original measurement.  If either of the QTc values from these repeated ECGs remains above 
the threshold value (ie, is 45 msec from the baseline, or is 500 msec), then a single ECG 
must be repeated at least hourly until QTc values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.
If QTc values remain 500 msec (or 45 msec from the baseline) for greater than 4 hours (or 
sooner, at the discretion of the investigator), or QTc intervals get progressively longer, the 
subject should undergo continuous ECG monitoring.  A cardiologist should be consulted if QTc intervals do not return to less than 500 msec (or to <45 msec above the baseline) after 8 hours of monitoring (or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator).C

Final Protocol, 21 November 2016
Page 38In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads are placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine-read QTc value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range.
7.2. Pharmacokinetics 
The actual times may change, but the number of samples will remain the same.  All efforts 
will be made to obtain the PK samples at the exact nominal time relative to dosing.  However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60-minute sample) from dosing will not be captured as a protocol deviation, as long as the exact time of the sample collection is noted on the source document and data collection tool (eg, CRF). 
Samples will be analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with vendor 
standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The PK samples must be processed and shipped as indicated in the instructions provided to 
the investigator site to maintain sample integrity. Any deviations from the PK sample handling procedure (eg, sample collection and processing steps, interim storage or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_19944]), including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.On a case-by-case basis, the sponsor may make a determination as to whether sample integrity has been compromised.  Any deviation from the specified sample handling procedure resulting in compromised sample integrity will be considered a protocol deviation.
PK samples may be used for metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanalytical 
method, as well as for any other internal exploratory purposes.  These data will not be included in the CSR.
7.2.1. Analysis of Acetaminophen Pharmacokinetics
During all study periods, blood samples (4 mL) to provide approximately 1.5 mL plasma for 
pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of acetaminophen will be collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing K
2EDTA at times specified in the Schedule of Activities section of the 
protocol.

Page 397.3. Banked Biospecimens
Banked biospecimens will be collected from subjects for exploratory research relating to the 
drug response and disease/condition under study.  These collections are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_19353] a planned assessment described in the protocol.  They will be handled in a manner that protects each subject’s privacy and confidentiality.  Banked biospecimens will be assigned the subject’s study identification code (ID) at the site.  The data generated from these banked biospecimens will also be indexed by [CONTACT_168084].  Biospecimens will be kept until destruction in facilities with access limited to authorized personnel, and biospecimen-derived data will be stored on password-protected computer systems.  The key between the subject’s ID and the subject’s direct personally identifying information (eg, name, address) will be held at the study site.  Biospecimens will be used only for the purposes described in the protocol and informed consent document; any other uses require additional ethical approval.  Unless a time limitation is required by [CONTACT_240846], biospecimens will be stored for many years (no time limit) to allow for research in the future, including research conducted during the lengthy drug-development process and also post-marketing research.  Subjects may withdraw their consent for the use of their banked biospecimens at any time by [CONTACT_7328] a request to the investigator; in this case, any remaining biospecimens will be destroyed, but data already generated from the biospecimens will continue to be available to protect the integrity of existing analyses. 
Unless prohibited by [CONTACT_167188], a 4-mL blood genomic 
banked biospecimen Prep D1 (dipotassium edetic acid [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] 
[K
2EDTA] whole-blood collection optimized for DNA analysis) will be collected at the 
time specified in the Schedule of Activities section of the protocol to be retained for potential 
pharmacogenomic/genomic/biomarker analyses related to drug response and disease/condition under study.  For example, putative safety biomarkers, drug-metabolizing enzyme genes, drug-transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechanism of drug action may be examined.  The primary purpose is to examine DNA; however, the biospecimen may also be used to study other molecules (eg, RNA, proteins, and metabolites).
 
 
 
The banked biospecimens will be collected from all subjects unless prohibited by [CONTACT_168085]/EC decision. 
It is possible that the use of these biospecimens may result in commercially viable products.  
Subjects will be advised in the informed consent document that they will not be compensated in this event.CCI

Page 407.3.1. Additional Rese arch 
Unless prohibited by  [CONTACT_168086]/ ECdecision, subjects will be asked to indicate 
on the consent form whether they will allow banked biospecimens to also be used to design 
and conduct research in order to gain a further understanding of o ther diseases and to 
advance science, including development of other medicines for patients.
Subjects need not provide additional biospecimens for the uses described in this section; the 
biospecimens specified in 
the B anked Biospecimens section will be use d.  Subjects may  still 
participate in the study if they  elect not to allow their banked biospecimens to be used for the 
additional purposes described in this section.
7.4. Food Intake Assessment
Food intake will be assessed at the times listed in Table 2of the Schedule of Activities .
All meals will be prepared at the study  site while the subject is inpatient .  For every  ad 
libitum meal, each portion will be weighed and recorded before and after each meal . The 
following parameters will be measured: total kcal consumed per day , total kcal of each 
macronutrient consumed per day , total kcal consumed per meal and total kcal of each 
macronutrient consumed per meal.  The total daily nutritional composition offered in t he 
inpatient meals will be approximately  50% carbohy drates, 35% fat and 15% protein.
Observed food intake will be measured as the total number of calories consumed during the 
specified time period, calculated (to the nearest 50 kcal) as the difference of t he total number 
of calories provided minus the total number of calories remaining after meals.
7.5.Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Questionnaire
Appetite, s atiety , fullness, hunger , and prospective consumption will be measured at the 
study  site using a validated VAS questionnaire .25The VAS questionnaire will be completed 
by [CONTACT_801142] 4 time points: immediately prior to administration of the meal, 
30, [ADDRESS_1105903] a vertical line across a 100 millimeter 
(mm) line to rank their response to various questions.  The 100 mm line is anchored b y 
responses such as “N ot At All Full” and “Totally  Full” at either end.  Scoring will consist of 
measuring the distance of the vertical line from the response at the left end and will be used 
to explore the relationships between subjective reports of appetite and other VAS meas ures 
immediately  prior to and following administration of the meal.
Questionnaires will be provided to the subjects showing one question at a time ( eg,one 
question on each page).  Study  staff will instruct the subjects to complete their responses to 
allVAS questions by  [CONTACT_1299] a mark at the point on the 100 mm line which corresponds to 
how the subjects are feel ing.  Subjects will be instructed not to discuss or compare their 
ratings with other subjects during this assessment.  Subjects will not be able to refer to their 
previous ratings when marking the VAS at each time point.  
The measurement will be scored 
by [CONTACT_801143] e,in millimeters, the distance from the left end of the line to 
the mark made b y subjects using a standardized ruler .  This value in millimeters will be 
entered into the CRF for each question at each time point .

Activities : prior to breakfast and at 30, 60, 90, 120, [ADDRESS_1105905] blood sampling at 300 minutes should be completed before the ad libitum lunch.  Deviations in blood sampling time for gastric emptying >10% of the nominal time (eg, more than 6 minutes of a 60-minute sample) will be recorded as a protocol deviation.
7.8. Blood Volume
The total blood sampling volume for individual subjects in this study is approximately 
530 mL.  The actual collection times of blood sampling may change.  Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by [CONTACT_4618], provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days.

8.1.Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; 
(2)non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under 
study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE

exposureExposure during pregnancy , 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure 
(regardless of whether 
associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatm entgroup or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_1105908] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does no t become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain ade quate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
request ed by [CONTACT_22835] -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF.  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete m edical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a

Report Form; additional source documents ( eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using con cise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spo ntaneously
reported b y the stud y subject.  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4.
Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for e ach subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1105910].
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring i n a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs a re recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessmen t of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causa lity assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality  assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship i
n the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspe cted unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

A9001498
Final Protocol ,[ADDRESS_1105911] or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progre ssion/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 47Test re sult requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is dete rmined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
Animportant medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, i f it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Medical device complaints may  meet the SAE reporting requirement criteria (see the Medical 
Device Complaint Reporting Requirements section).  An incident is an y malfunction (ie, the 
failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as intended; 
performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device) that, 
directly  or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject, or user, or of 
other persons, or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. 

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 48A serious injury  that can cause a serious deterioration in state of health can include:
A life -threatening illness, even if temporary  in nature;
A permanent impairment of a bod y function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; 
A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above 2 
bulleted items;
Examples: clinically  relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure; a 
condition that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233004];
Any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or in vitro diagnostic 
device test results when used within the manufacturer’s instructions for use;
Fetal distress, fetal death , or any  conge nital abnormality  or birth defects.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47575] y initial admission (even les
s than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit ( eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801119]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] ( eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801120] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition ( eg,for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 49Social admission ( eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission ( eg,for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg,for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (e g,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These shoul d be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which t he procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be rec orded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades ar e defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, list ed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug- induced liver injury  

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 50(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elev ations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevatio ns in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury  
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evalu ated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2×
ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available.
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. 
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_1105912] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatin e kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history ,
including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg,biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test ( LFT)abnormalities has y et been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability 
of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.2. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeed ing, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both una pproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (e g,because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the inv estigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (e g, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page 52A male has been exposed (e g, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/ or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.
  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (e g,a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information subm itted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The i nvestigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-proce dure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE ( ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1105913]. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a c ase-by-
case basis ( eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.

A9001498
Final Protocol ,21 November 2016
Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of t he presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding wome n (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is r eported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not rec orded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.3. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

Medication errors m ay result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength .
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational pro duct;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, w hich is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .

applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF. 
Medication errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within [ADDRESS_1105915] led to death or serious 
deterioration in health, or if it occurred again might lead to death or serious deterioratio n in 
health.
[COMPANY_007] is to be notified of all medical device complaints within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness of the event.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this s tudy 
is outlined here and further detailed in a s tatistical analysis plan (SAP) , which will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate ; however, any  major modifications of the primary  endpoint defin itionsor their
analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
The sample size is based on the primary  endpoint, change in mean energy  intake from 
baseline 
to Week6 (in kcal) for ad libitum lunch meals .  The standard de viation ( SD)for the 
change from baseline inenerg y intake (EI) for an ad libitum lunch meal was estimated to be 
approximatel y [ADDRESS_1105916] deviation of mean change from baseline in EI  was 
estimated from literature sources26
,27which were randomized, double -blind ,
placebo- controlled studies with endpoint sand experimental conditions similar to the current 
protocol. 
The null hy pothesis to be tested is that the difference between liraglutid e and placebo is 
greater than or equal to 0 after 6 weeks of dosing vs .the alternative h ypothesis that the 
difference between liraglutide and placebo is less than 0 after 6 weeks of dosing.  Using a 
between -group comparison at Week 6, 25 completers in eac h arm provides approximatel y 
85% power to detect a true mean change from baseline in energ y intake equal to 200 kcal.   
This assumes a ty pe1 error equal to 5% (one -sided).   Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_801121], for a higher estimated SD of approximatel y 283
kcal, the power would reduce to 79%.  
This estimate is for a test conducted at a one- sided level of significance of 5%.   Assuming a 
15% average drop -out in the study ,the sample size would be approximately 30 randomized 
subjects per arm for a total sam
ple size of 60 randomized subjects, y ielding 50 completers.

Page 559.2. Efficacy Analysis
All subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be included in the efficacy analysis:
Completed baseline assessment of food intake;
Received at least one dose of randomized, blinded IP; AND
Completed at least one post-baseline measurement (after taking randomized IP).
Subjects who withdraw prior to tolerating liraglutide 1.[ADDRESS_1105917] at Weeks 3 and 6 in the same model.  The primary time point for calculation of mean change from baseline at V3 is Week 6 (V5).  All other collection time points will be considered secondary.
 
 
 
  
 
 
Supplemental analyses of the primary variable will be performed to support the robustness of 
the conclusions drawn from the primary analysis described above such as, verifyingassumptions of normality.  Details of these supplemental analyses will be included in the SAP.
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) will be 
provided for the baseline and change from baseline values by [CONTACT_6982].
9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoint for food intake is change from baseline in 48-hour energy 
intake.  The analysis method will be similar to the analysis method for the primary endpoint. CCI
A9001498
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1105918] one concentration value is reported.
Similar to previously published studies,
17,28the following parameters will be assessed: 
maximum acetaminophen concentration (C max); time to maximum acetaminophen
concentration (T max); area under acetaminophen concentration curve from 0 to 60 minutes
(AUC 0–60 min ); area under acetaminophen concentration curve from 0 to 300 minutes
(AUC 0-300 min ) and relative acetaminophen exposure during the first postprandial hour
(AUC 0-60 min /AUC 0–300 min ).  PK concentrations will be summarized and presented with 
summary statistics and data permitting, additional pharmacokinetic parameters may be estimated. 
 
9.4. Analysis of Other Endpoints 
Pharmacogenomic data (Prep D1.5 samples),  
  When these samples are 
analyzed, the results will be reported separately and not part of the clinical study report. 
9.5. Safety Analysis
AEs, ECGs, BP, PR, and safety laboratory data will be reviewed and summarized, and any 
clinical laboratory, ECG, BP, and PR abnormalities of potential clinical concern will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate.
Medical history and physical examination information, as applicable, collected during the 
course of the study will be considered source data and will not be required to be reported, unless otherwise noted.  However, any untoward findings identified on physical CCI

inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as laboratory  data, ECGs, and vital signs , will be 
considered source data, and will not be required to be reported , unless o therwise noted.  
Demographic data collected at s creening will be reported .
The safet y analysis set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of 
blinded I P.  Safety  data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized
descriptivel y, where appropriate.  All safet y endpoints will be listed and summarized in 
accordance with [COMPANY_007] Data Standards.  Categorical outcomes ( eg, AEs) will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_153856].  Continuous outcome ( eg, BP, heart rate, e tc) will be 
summarized using N, mean, median, standard deviation, etc.  Change from baseline in 
laboratory  data, ECGs and vital signs will also be summarized.  Subject listings will be 
produced for these safet y endpoints accordingl y.
Data relevant to the a ssessment of suicidality  will be mapped to the Columbia -
Classification 
Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C -CASA) codes.   Baseline and post -baseline C -SSRS data 
(mapped to C -CASA scores) will be summarized descriptivel y by [CONTACT_801145] h post -baseline visit.
The safet y analyses will be carried out in the safety  population, detailed analy ses will be 
described in the SAP. 
9.5.1. Electrocardiogram Analysis
Changes from baseline for the ECG parameters QT interval, heart rate, QTc interval, PR 
interval,and QRS interval will be summarized by  [CONTACT_22841].
The number (%) of subjects with maximum post dose QTc values and maximum increases 
from baseline in the following categories will be tabulated b y treatment: 
Safety QTc Assessment
Borderlin e (msec) Prolonged (m sec)
Absolute value 450-<480 480
Absolute change 30-<60 60
In addition, the number of subjects with corrected and uncorrected QT values [ADDRESS_1105919] for studies 
conducted at non- [COMPANY_007] investigat or sites,to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical 
Practices ( GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  review source documents to 
confirm that the data recorded on CRFs[ data collection tool (DCT s)]are accurate.  T he 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.   This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  complet ion, t he investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC , and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investigator(s) wil l notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. 
The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject’s medical records.  The investigator will promp tly provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
For studies conducted at non -[COMPANY_007] investigator sites, it is important that the investigator(s) 
and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or 
inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/ Data Collection Tools/ Electronic Data Record
As use d in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collec tion method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized represent atives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other dat a collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_801146].  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs orsource 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .

collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the inves tigatorsite and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF ,and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or 
inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007] , the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting fo rms, source documents, 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH gui delines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study  agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg,
retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1105921] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitmen t advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file .  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, andthe general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organiza tions of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH G uideline for Good C linical Practice , and the Declaration of 
Helsinki.

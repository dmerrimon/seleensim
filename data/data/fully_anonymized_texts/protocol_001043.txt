This section provides a summary of major changes made in this current amendment (No. 02) 
to the protocol for Study USWM-LX1
-3003-2 along with changes made in the prior 
amendment (No. 01).  Section  23 provides a de
tailed accounting of all changes made in these 
amendments. 
SUMMARY OF M
AJOR CHANGES 
A
mendment No. 02 (May 21, 2015) 
 The protocol was revised to update subject reimbursement to account for up to 
3 in-of
fice screening visits (see Section  14.4) .  
 The protocol was clarified to indicate that subjects receiving lofexidine treatment on 
an outpatient basis
 are required to take a dose of lofexidine in the clinic at each daily 
clinic visit, thus allowing assessments to be performed before and after dosing as 
detailed in Table 1.  
 The protocol was clarified to indicate that should confirmatory vital sign 
measurements be
 required with waiting between measurements, the timing of the 
measurement will not be considered a protocol deviation (i.e., outside the protocol-
specified window). 
 The protocol was revised to add an electrocardiogram at 3.5 hours after dosing (or as 
close to this t
ime as possible) for the end-
of-study visit (see Section  15.5.3).  
 The protocol was revised to clarify syphilis testing results and interpretation for 
determi
nation of subject study eligibility (see  Table 4 in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  

 Three urinary drug screen panels were added, including oxycodone, phencyclidine 
and methy
lenedioxymethamphetamine (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .  
 
Amendment No. 01 (Januar
y 22, 2015) 
 The protocol was revised to allow enrollment of subjects with clinical treatment goals 
for full
 or partial withdrawal from any opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (including methadone and 
buprenorphine), which would be expected to elicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_551450] [ADDRESS_724553]-assisted total withdrawa
l, dose reduction of maintenance 
treatment (e.g., methadone, bupre
norphine), and transition from an opi[INVESTIGATOR_551451].  An attempt will be made to 
include a minimum of 50 subjects each treated for clinical scenarios involving 
methadone or buprenorphine treatment (i.e
., a total of 50 subjects receiving full or 
partial dose reduction from methadone, metha
done-assisted withdrawal, and other 
methadone treatment scenarios and a total of 50 subjects receiving full or partial dose 209229

Confidential Information Page 4 of 120 reduction from buprenorphine, transition to buprenorphine maintenance, and other 
buprenorphine treatment scenarios).  The change was introduced to enable the study 
of lofexidine’s utility in any situation in which mitig
ation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_551452].  Both 
buprenorphine and methadone clinical scenarios are being evaluated as clinically 
relevant scenarios where lofexidine’s use is likely.  Results of prior interaction studies 
do not suggest a significant safety concern with coadministration of lofexidine and 
both methadone and buprenorphine.  Further eva
luation of the safety and clinical 
utility of lofexidine coadministered with methadone or buprenorphine will help 
confirm that a contraindication for use of lofexidine with agonists is unnecessary. 
The protocol was revised to use the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
(M.I.N.I.) rather than the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-I V-TR Axis I
Disorders (SCID) to establish the appropriate dependence diagnosis on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],
exclude other drug dependency, and determine the absence of major psychiatric
disorders.  M.I.N.I. is being used for consistency with eligibility assessment in
companion study, USWM-LX1-3003-1.  Like SCID, the M.I.N.I. is a validated scale
(Sheehan et al., 1998) and is commonly used in clinical practice and research studies.
Number of subjects needed for enrollment was increased from 200 to 400 to
250 t o 500 based on the projected number of subjects completing 7 days of lofexidine
treatment in the companion study (USWM-LX1-3003-1) and FDA’s safety 
database
requirements.  Enrollment in USWM-LX1-3003-[ADDRESS_724554] 7 days.
Number of study sites was increased from 10 to approximately 20 to account for the
potentially higher enrollment requirements and target study completion timelines.
The protocol was revised from flexible dosing to standardized dosing of 7 days of
lofexidine treatment, starting at 3.2 mg daily (0.8 mg QID), with lowering of the dose
allowed to 2.4 mg daily (0.6 mg QID) if required for tolerability based on the  subject’s
individual treatment goal and response per clinical judgment of the Principal
Investigator.  The standard dosing approach is being 
adopted to limit variability  across
sites and treatment scenarios to ensure interpretability of safety data at clinically
relevant doses and to evaluate the same doses as used in the controlled  
programs with
demonstrated efficacy.
The protocol was revised to require 3 days of mandatory in-clinic (inpatient  
housing/
clinic facilities) treatment with lofexidine (Days 1-3) and then, per clinical  judgment
of 
the Principal Investigator, subjects can continue 
to receive all 4 daily  doses of
lofexidine in the clinic or can be treated as outpatients for the remaining
4 days of mandatory lofexidine treatment (Days 4-7).  Subjects can continue  receiving
lofexidine on a semi-standardized taper in an outpatient setting as long as
 acute
withdrawal symptoms persist at the Principal Investigator’s discretion;  however, in no
event is treatment to exceed an additional 7 days (maximum of209229

Protocol No. USWM-LX1-3003-2, Amendment No. 02 May 21, 2015 
Confidential Information Page 5 of 120 14 days treatment over entire study).  The required initial 3 days of in-clinic treatment 
was introduced to enable 
more frequent safety mo
nitoring during anticipated peak 
withdrawal and initiation of lofexidine therapy.  Outpatient treatment for continuation 
of therapy begins at Day 4 to enable assessment, as clinically appropriate at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator, in a more flexible, real-world setting as 
patients with a variety of treatment goals, as being studied in the current design, may 
not require a longer-term clinic stay and in many situations it may be impractical to 
require inpatient treatment for more than a few days (e.g., work schedules). 
The protocol was revised to require daily (rather than every other day) assessments,
including during in-clinic treatment and at daily clinic visits during outpatient
treatment.  As the primary objective of the study is to assess safety of lofexidine at
clinically relevant doses, daily evaluations regardless of inpatient or outpatient status
are appropriate.
The Short Opi[INVESTIGATOR_551453] (SOWS-Gossop) was added because
this scale has been evaluated in nearly all other lofexidine studies in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551454], serving as the instrument to evaluate efficacy as the primary endpoint in
the 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_551455]; and the SOWS-Gossop data will be
used to evaluate lofexidine’s effectiveness in a variety of open-label clinical scenarios
studied under the current protocol.
Requirements for vital signs were expanded during in-clinic treatment with  lofexidine,
similar to requirements in the companion study (USWM-LX1-3003-1). Also a subject
diary (Appendix 3) was added if the 
required post-dose blood pressure/pulse
measurement cannot be obtained in the clinic.  These changes were
 introduced to
ensure the most robust safety data collection possible during the
in-clinic portion of the study and providing a mechanism for additional data  collection
in the outpatient setting, consistent with the primary objective of the study.
A fingerprick blood sample concurrently with each scheduled ECG was added to
enable QTc-concentration analyses.
A fingerprick blood sample 
was added for analysis of plasma lofexidine  concentration
to monitor compliance during outpatient treatment.
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was added as a safety assessment,
consistent with the current guidance to assess suicidality in all clinical studies
involving central nervous system acting drugs.[ADDRESS_724555] 7 days at clinically relevant doses 
(3.2 or 2.4  mg/day ) to all eviate symptoms of acute withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_551456] a variety of clinical scenarios in both in -clinic  and outpatient settings.  
The effectiveness of lofexidine  is also of interest.  
Study Design  Multicenter, open -label study in the [LOCATION_002] in which s ubjects will 
receive lofexidine treatment for 7 days, starting at a dose of 3.2  mg daily 
(0.8 mg QID), with lowering of the dose allowed to 2.4  mg daily (0.6  mg 
QID) if required for tolerability based on the subject’s individual treatment 
goal and response  per clinical judgment of the Principal  Investigator.  Note 
that all subjects will start lofexidine administration (Day  1) on the first day 
of his/her planned opi[INVESTIGATOR_551457]/ discontinuation regardless 
of the clinical situation in which the s ubject is seeking treatment (see 
Inclusion Criterion No.  3).  All subjects will receive all [ADDRESS_724556] 3  days (Days 1 -3) and then, per 
clinical judgment of the Principal  Investigator, subjects can continue to 
receive lofexidine doses in a clinic setting or can be treated outside of the 
clinic (outpatient)  for the remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine 
treatment (Days  4-7).  Per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], subjects can 
continue lofexidine treatment beyond D ay 7 on an outpatient basis  only for 
up to an additional 7  days (Days  8-14).  Note that l ofexidine dosing may be 
stopped at any time during Days  8-14.  No subject will receive lofexidine 
for more than [ADDRESS_724557] is 
not dosed within this window as a result of completion of confirmatory vital 
sign assessments (Section 10.4), this will not constitute as a protocol 
deviation.  Source documents must note, however, the reason for dose 
delay.  For subjects receiving outpatient treatment (elective) on Days  4-7 
and those continuing lofexidine treatment in a mandatory outpatient setting 
for up to an additional 7  days (Days  8-14), prescribed dosing will remain on 
the same QID schedule (8  AM, 1 PM, 6  PM, 11  PM).

8 STUDY SPONSOR 
This study will be conduc
ted under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application (#47,857) 
held by [CONTACT_351760], LLC. 
9 STUDY SITES AND INVESTIGATORS 
This study will be conducted at approximately 20 study sites in the US.  It is the 
responsibility of the Principal Inve
stigators to make sure this protocol is conducted in ful l 
conformance with the ethical principles detailed in Section 16 of this protocol.  All data will 
be colle
cted at the study sites on source documents and entered at the site into electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) as described in Section  18.[ADDRESS_724579] seeking tre
atment for partial or total opi[INVESTIGATOR_551464] .  This can include a variety of clinical situations where opi[INVESTIGATOR_551465], such as (but not limited to) abrupt and total withdrawal (including from 
methadone and buprenorphine), agonist-assisted total withdrawal, dose reduction of 
maintenance treatment (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine), and transition from an opi[INVESTIGATOR_551466].  Subjects will be evaluated for their 
compliance with protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria
 during a screening period, lasting up to 
9 days.  Approximately 250 to 500 subjects will receive lofexidine treatment for 7 days, 
starting a
t a dose of 3.2 mg daily
 (0.8 mg QID), with lowering of the dose allowed to 2.4 mg 
daily (0.6 mg QID) if require
d for tolerability based on the subject’s individual treatment 
goal and response per cli
nical judgment of the Principal Investigator.  Lofexidine 
administration should be initiated in concurrence with the change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551467] (e.g., first day of dose reduction, or first day of 
abrupt cessation) or on the first day of emerge
nce/anticipated emergence of such symptoms 
as determined at the Investigator’s discretion.  Details regarding the timing of lofexidine 
therapy initi
ation relative to change
 in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551468]/expected onset of symptoms 
should be captured in the source.  All subjects will receive all [ADDRESS_724580] 3 days (Days
 1-3) and then, per clinical judgment of the Principal 
Investigator, subjects can conti
nue to re
ceive lofexidine doses in a clinic setting or can be 
treated outside of the clinic (outpatient) for th
e remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine 209229
uswm-lx1-3003-2-protocol-and-amendments  Pg. 23
Protocol No. USWM-LX1-3003-2, Amendment No. 02 May 21, 2015 
Confidential Information Page 23 of 120 treatment (Days 4-7).  Per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], subjects can continue lofexidine 
treatment beyond Day 7 on an outpatient basis  only for up to an additional 7 days 
(Days 8-14).  Note that lofexidine dosing ma
y be stopped at any time during Days 8-14.  No 
subject will receive lofexidine for more
 than [ADDRESS_724581] drop-out rates in this protocol.  
Enrollment will continue until a minimum total of 300 subjects (across this protocol and 
earlier lofexidine clinical studies expected to meet FDA safety database requirements) have 
been treated with clinically relevant doses of lofexidine for a minimum of [ADDRESS_724582] up to 9 days, followed by [CONTACT_8622] 
14 days of treatment with lofexidine. 
The
 study will be terminated when the database is judge
d to be sufficient, i.e., a minimum of 
300 subjects (across this protocol and earlier lofexidine clinical studies expected to meet 
FDA safety database requirements) have
 been treated with clinically relevant doses of 
lofexidine for a minimum of 7 days.  Enrollment is
 anticipated to take 4 to 10 months to 
achieve, with the total clinical duration of USWM
-LX1-3003-2 anticipated to be 8 to 
12 months. 
10.4 Dose Hold and Discontinuation Criteria (2 of 3 Rule) 
When a blood pressure, he
art ra
te, or QTcF interval value meets criteria for withholding a 
dose (Section 13.2.2 ) or discontinuation from the study (Section 13.2.3 ), the value needs to 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_551554], approximately 10 to 15 minutes later.  If the value is confirmed by [CONTACT_551555], the appropriate action will be taken 
(dose hold or study discontinuation) and 
the confirmatory value will be recorded in the subject’s source document and appropriate 
eCRF.  If the second value does not meet the specified criteria, a third measurement will be 
taken approximately 10 to 15 minutes later.  If this value is confirmatory, the appropriate 
action will be taken (dose hold or study discontinuation) and the la
st confirmatory value will 
be recorded in the subject’s source document and appropriate eCRF.  If the third value does 
not confirm the initial finding, then no action should be taken and the third value should be 
entered in the subject’s source and appropriate eCRF.  Note that should a second or third 
measurement be re
quired with waiting between measurements, the timing of the 209229

Confidential Information  Page 24 of 120 measurement will not be 
considered a protocol deviation (i.e., outside the protocol-specified 
window). 
Whenever blood pressure, heart ra
te, or QTcF interval values meet dose hold or study 
discontinuation criteria, these are to be recorded on the subject’s eCRF as an adverse event 
(AE) or serious adverse event (SAE), as applicable.  Examples are:

12 INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS 
12.1 Lofexidine Hydrochloride 
Lofexidine hydrochloride is an 2-adrenergic agonist with mild to moderate antihypertensive 
actions. 
 It has the empi[INVESTIGATOR_551471] C 11H13Cl3N2O representing a molecular weight of 
295.61.  The structural formula is: 
 
Lofexidine hydrochloride
 is a synthetic product and has the chemical designation of 2- [1-
(2,6-dichlorophenoxy)ethyl]-4,5 dihydro-1H- imidazole monohydrochloride.  It is a white to 
off-white crystalline powder that i
s very soluble in water and ethanol.  It is lightly soluble in 
2-propanol and practically insoluble in ether.  Lofexidine hydrochloride melts at 
approxima
tely 126-128°C. 
Lofexidine will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034] ( USWM) in peach colored tablets containing 
0.2 mg of ac
tive medication for oral administration. 
12.2 Dispensing Investigational Agent  
Lofexidine will be
 packaged and distributed through the pharmacy coordinating center 
(Sharp).  Lofexidine tablets will
 be supplied in uniquely-identified 80-count bottles.  During 
in-clinic treatment, lofexidine doses will be dispensed directly from the 80-count bottles, 
whereas for outpatient treatment doses will be dispensed by [CONTACT_551557] [INVESTIGATOR_551472].  One to 2 days of medication may be dispensed at each daily 
clinic visit to accommodate flex
ible scheduling (e.g., day and a half worth of medication to 
supply subject from one morning to the
 next afternoon depending on availability for clinic 
visit).  The site will maintain a dispensing log for each bottle and document the number of 
tablets dispensed to each subject along with the number of tablets returned, if any, by [CONTACT_551558].  Returned tablets will not be re-dispensed to future subjects. 
[ADDRESS_724589] or designee. 
12.3 Blinding Plan  
This is an open-label study. 
12.4 Labeling 
The investigational agent, lofexidine, will be packaged in labeled bottles (80 count pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) and 
during the outpatient portion of the study dispensed to subjects i
n labeled prescription bottles 
(i.e., redispensing container).  The product label will include the sponsor’s name, protocol 
number, the number of t
ablets in the 
bottle, address, 24-hour emergency phone number, and 
the following statement – “Cauti

During outpa
tient treatment
 (Days 4-14), sites may dispense 1 to 2 days of medication at 
each daily clinic visit t
o accommodate flexible scheduling for use in an outpatient setting 
(e.g., day and a half worth of medication to supply subject from one morning to the next 
afternoon depending on availa
bility for clinic visit).  In such cases, the redispensing container 
will include a subject label, supplied by [CONTACT_3452], and will include the following 
information: 
 P rincipal Investigator’s name [CONTACT_114040], 
 Subject number, 
 Date of dispensing, 
 Dire
ctions for use, 
 Dru
g name / dose or protocol number, 
 Number of

Confidential Information  Page 29 of 120 12.7 Used/Unused Supplies
 
Unused investigational agent will be retained at the participating sites to enable a full 
investigational drug inventory by [CONTACT_30107]’ respective monitor.  If any investigational agent is 
lost or damaged, its dispositi
on should be documented.  The Sponsor will provide 
instructions to return the unused study drug to the pharmacy coordinating center periodically 
throughout the study (following monitor review) or at the end of the study for proper 
destruction in accordance with local and federal regulations. 
12.8 Contraindications  
Clonidine is specifically prohibited in this study. 
To avoid drug-drug interactions, lofexidine should not be administered concurrently with: 
 tricyclic antidepressants – may reduce the efficacy of imidazoline derivatives; and 
 beta-receptor blockers – the combination of lofexidine and beta-receptor blockers 
should be used with ca
ution to avoid the r
isk of excessive bradycardia.  
Lofexidine may enhance the effects of antihypertensive drug therapy and appropriate caution 
is warranted in subjects on such therapy.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551473]’s antihypertensive dose during the study. 
Lofexidine should generally not be administered concurrently with alcohol, sedatives, and 
anesthetics as these may interac
t with lofexidine and enhance its central sedative effects. 
13 TREATMENT PLAN 
13.1 Investigational Agent  
All subjects in this study will receive lofexidine, as described in Section 13.2 . 
13.2 Dose Administration 
13.2.1
 Administration of Doses 
Lofexidine administration should be initiated in concurrence with the change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551474] (e.g., first day of dose reduction, or first 
day of abrupt cessation) or on the first day of emergence/anticipated emergence of such 
symptoms as determined at the Investigator’s discretion.  Details regarding the timing of 
lofexidine thera
py initiation relative to change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551468]/expected onset of 
symptoms should be captured in the source.  All subjects will take lofexidine orally for

individual treatment goal and response per cli
nical judgment of the Principal Investigator.  
The subject’s dose may be changed back to 3.2 mg/day, per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], 
but in no case is the dose
 of lofexidine to exceed 3.2 mg /day (or a single dose of 0.8 mg).

judgment of the Principal Investigator, subjects can continue 
to receive lofexidine doses in a clinic se

 or can be treated outside of the clinic 
(outpatient) for the remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine treatment (Days 4-7).  Note 
that the decision to allow outpatient treatment should take into a
ccount the subject’s 
sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of the study medication (as observed over Days 1-3) and 
the subject’s potential for noncompliance.  Furthermore, the r
ationale for the decision to 
continue treatment through either an in-clinic or outpatient setting must be documented in the 
subject’s source document.   
During in-clinic
 treatment, subjec

For subjects receiving outpatient treatment (elective) on 
Days 4-7 and those continuing optional lofexidine treatment in an outpatient setting for up to 
an additional 7 days (Days 8-14), pr
escribed dosing will remain on the same QID schedule 
(8 AM, 1 PM, 6 PM, 11 PM) with compliance
 assessed at the next day’s clinic visit by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_9650], subject report of dosing in diary ( Appendix 3
), and a fingerprick blood sample to 
assess plasma lofexidine concentrations.
  Note that if the subject is receiving outpatient 
treatment, he/she is required to take a dose
 of lofexidine in the clinic at each daily clinic visit. 
Optional Outpatient Treatment (Days 8-14)  
Per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], subjects can continue lofexidine treatment on an 
outpatient basis for up to an additional [ADDRESS_724593]’s source

change in prescribed dosing will be recorded and confirmed also by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_551475]. 
13.4 Nicotine Replacement Therapy  
Subjects may be permitted to smoke during their in-clinic participation in study based on 
individual site
 policy.  If they usuall
y use tobacco products, they will be offer ed and 
encourage
d to use nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gum, inhaler, or nasal spray) while 
they are in the in -clinic fa
cility to treat their nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  If smoking i s 
permitted by a participating sit
e, smo
king breaks outside of the in-clinic facility must be 
constantly observed and supervised. 
The e
stimated total number of tobacco products used by [CONTACT_551560]-clinic 
treatment will be recorded in the subject’s source document and on the eCRF. 
[ADDRESS_724597] Recruitme
nt and Consent 
Interested subjects, who respond to recruitment materials and are available to stay for the 
mandatory 3-day in-clinic trea
tment part of the study and available for participation in either 
an in-clinic or outpatient setting for 4
 additional days (total commitment of 7 days), will be 
scheduled to meet with a qualified investigative staf
f member and receive an explanation of 
the study purpose and requirements in lay language.  During the initial interview, the 
interviewer should not ask questions in a manner that reveals the eligibility criteria for study 
entry. 
If still interested after receiving an explanation of the study, a qualified investigative site staff 
member will review the study informed consent form with subjects, and subjects will be 
given an opportunity to review on their own, inquire about, and sign the informed consent 
form (see Section  16.4 ).  The subject will then be given a copy of the signed consent form.  
After
 that, subje
cts will be given a subject number and proceed to the screening phase of the 
study.  Screening assessments must be completed within a 9-day time period, but can be 
completed as early as the first sc
reening day.  At no time during the screening process should 
individuals be given information regarding inclusion or
 exclusion criteria.  When individuals 
are evaluated, questions should be asked in a way that the criteria are not discernible. 
Any subject who has difficulty understanding the information contained in the consent form 
will reread the misunderstood portion(s) of the consent and discuss with a research staff 
member until s/he shows complete understanding of the information in the consent form, and 
may thus give full consent.  Research staff will work closely with the subject in an effort to [ADDRESS_724598]’s sole expense.  Subjects who are excluded, or who 
decline participation, may be rescreened at a later time, although at least [ADDRESS_724599] occur 
between screenings.  Subjects who refuse
 to participate or who withdraw from the study will 
be treated without prejudice. 
14.2 Screening 
Screening assessments will be conducted as shown in Table 1 (Section 15).  The screening 
period will l
ast up to [ADDRESS_724600] satisfy the eligibility criteria and 
complete all required screenin
g assessment s. 
14.3 Treatment Phase 
14.3.1 Days 1-3 (Mandatory In-clinic)

(Day 1) before study drug a
dministration on Day 1.  After all Baseline requirements have 
been completed (Section  15.2), subjects will receive their first dose of lofexidine during the 
8 AM dosing window on Day 1.  Subjects will be dosed 4 times daily from Day 1 through 
Day 3 at 
8 AM , 1 PM , 6 PM, and 11 PM .  Vital signs wil l be recorded within 30 minutes 
before every dose and 3 .5 hours (±15 mi
nutes) after the 8 AM, 1 PM, and 6 PM dose.  
12-lead ECGs will also be
 collected befor
e the firs
t dose on Day 1 (8 AM) and 3.5 hours 
(±15 minutes) after dosing.  Note that should a se
cond or third measurement be required with 
waiting between measurements, the timi
ng of the measurement will not be considered a 
protocol deviation (i.e., outside the protocol-specified window).  Other clinical assessments 
will be gathered between 11:
00 AM and noon each day (see a complete list of assessments in 
Table 1).  These clinical assessments a
re described in detail in Sections  15.3.5 and 15.5. 
14.3.2 Days 4-7 (In-clinic/O

Per clinical judgment of the Principal I
nvestigator, subjects can continue to receive 
lofexidine treatment in a clinic se
tting or can be treated outside of the clinic (outpatient) for 
the remaining 4 days of mandator
y lofexidine treatment (Days 4-7).  All subjects receiving 
lofexidine treatment on an outpatient basis will be r
equired to take a dose of lofexidine in the 
clinic at each daily clinic visit, with required clinical assessments performed before and after 
dosing as detailed in Table [ADDRESS_724601] been completed (see Section  15.3.4 ). 209229

The Sponsor (USWM) has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for 
terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 the incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to subjects; 
 subject enrollment is unsatisfactory ;  
 data recording is inaccurate or incomplete; and 
 the safet
y database is judged to be sufficient, i.e., a minimum of 300 subjects (across

for subjects to complete a screening within the ±2-day window (e.g., holidays, vacations, 
personal emergencies).  Determination of the maximum visit window deviation is, however, 
at the discretion of the medical monitor.  Written informed consent must be obtained from all 
study subjects before initiation of any stud y
 procedures. 
The following screening assessments must be completed during screening after determining 
eligibility and written informed consen
t is obtained:  height; weight; vital signs 
(sitting/standing blood pressure and pulse; respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]; and temperature); blood collection for 
standard clinical safety laboratory assessments (including hematology and biochemistry); 
urine sample for confirmatory drug testing, urinalysis, and pregnancy assessment (if female); 
and infectious disease assessment (se

:  one sample will go to the 
central lab  for urinalysis; the other sample will be used 
for “dipstick” analysis of pregnancy and qualitative drug screening. 
The assessments listed below must a

15.4.3 Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] (COWS) 
The COWS [ 17] will be used to assess the effectiveness of lofexidine in alleviation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_48530], and will be completed after the SOWS-Gossop and before the assessment of 
completion of pre-defined withdrawal treatment goal.  It will be completed at baseline 
(before dosing on Day 1), once daily at 3.[ADDRESS_724629] dose of study medication 
during in-clinic treatment, and onc
e daily before an in-clinic dose of lofexidine during 
outpatient treatment.  The COWS is a clinician-
administered instrument that rates 11 
common opi[INVESTIGATOR_551487] (Appendix 2).  These include:  resting pulse 
rate; sweating; restlessness; pupil size
; bone or joint aches; runny nose or tearing; 
gastrointestinal (GI) upset; tremor; yawning; anxiety or irritability; and gooseflesh skin.  The 
score for each item reflects the severity of the sign or symptom, and the total scores are 
grouped as mild (5-12 points), moderate (13-24 points), moderately severe (25-36 points), 
and severe (>36 points). 
15.5 Safety Assessment Methods 
15.5.1 Adverse Events 
The occurrence of AEs will be assessed starting at the treatment phase of the protocol 
(i.e., with the first dose of study drug).  Any AE that occurs during screening will be 
recorded in the subject’s Medical Histor
y eCRF.  The occurrence of Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) will be assessed after signing of the informed consent form. [ADDRESS_724630], 
“How have you been feeling
 since I saw you last?”  After current AEs are assessed, the study 
physician or assi
gned staff must review with the subject and assess any AEs unresolved from 
the previous day.  For each daily AE assessment, details will be record ed in the subject’s 
source docum
ent and AE eCRF, according to the procedures described in Section 16.7, the 
type of 
AE and whether it is serious (SAE) or non-serious, severity of each AE, and th e 
relationship to the study agent.  These ca
tegories are asking for the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551488]’s best judg
ment of the severity and relatedness of each AE.  The Principal 
Investi
gator or physician designee will also record, based on his/her best judgment, whether 
the AE is secondary to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] (see S
ection  [IP_ADDRESS]).  In general, an AE should 
not be marked as withdrawal related AND relate
d to study medication. 
Any study subject with a related AE will be followed until the event is resolved to the 
satisfaction of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_80336]’s Medical Monitor.  If the AE is 
unrelated, the subject will be followed until medically stable, and then will be referred, at the 
subject’s sole expense, for ongoin
g care and/or treatment, which may include psychological 
and lifestyle counseling, support groups, or pharmacological and medical treatment. 
During outpatient treatment, subjects will be queried about AEs at each daily clinic visit.  All 
subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_551563]/or bradycardia (see list in Section  13.2.2) 
(especially on standing fr
om a sitting or lying position) and delay additional lofexidine 
dosing until further instructed. 
All reported AEs will be recorded as described above. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal-Related Adverse Events 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551489], based on his/her best 
judgment, whether the AE is secondary
 to opi[INVESTIGATOR_48530].  Individual items reported on 
the efficacy scales (i.e., SOWS-
Gossop, COWS) do not  automatically qualify as a 
withdrawal-related AE unless the subject specifically reports them in response to the non-
leading question (i.e., “How have you been feeling since I saw you last?”).  In the event a 
subject reports “withdra
wal” or a similar event encompassing a collection of potential 
withdrawal symptoms, the subject should be asked to elaborate so that each specifi c 
symptom can be recorded on the AE eCRF.  In general, an AE/SAE should not be marked as 
withdrawal related AND related to study medic
ation. 
15.5.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (sitting/standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) will be measured at 
screening for all subjects. 209229

measured before an in-cli
nic dose of lofexidine and 3.5 hours (±30 minutes) after dosing on

Sec
tions  15.5.1, 16.7 , and 16.8 ) and the subject should be f
ollowed until medically stabilized 
to the satisfacti
on of the study physician. 
Additionally, when the subject is experiencing blood pressure- or pulse-related symptoms 
(e.g., lightheaded, dizziness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]), the
se should be recorded on the subject’s eCRF as 
an AE or SAE (see Sections
 15.5.1, 16.7, and 16.8) even if the vital signs values do not meet 
the pre-de
fined criteria detailed in Sections  13.2.2  and 13.2.3. 
15.5.3 12-Lead
 Electrocardiograms 
Using the ECG core lab-provided and validated instruments, baseline paper tracing 12-lead 
ECG (in duplicate) will be conducted on one day during the screening period at 8 AM (or as 
close to 8 AM as possible) and at 11:[ADDRESS_724635] dose on 
Day 1 at 8 AM and 3.5 hours (±15 minutes) after dosi
ng; before the subject’s last dos e and 
3.5 hours after dosing (or as close to this time as possible); or, if applicable, at 
discontinuation from the study.  ECG intervals and a
bnormalities will be read centrally by a 
computer and confirmed by [CONTACT_551564] 
.  A qualified physician on site will evaluate tracings if there is a significant 
abnormality.  The following
 intervals will be computed: 
 Ventricular Rate Number of R waves appearing within a 6-second period, 
multiplie
d by 10; 
 PR Interval Measured from the onset of the P wave to the onset of the 
QRS complex; 209229

Q wave to t
he completion of the upstroke of the S wave; 
 QT Interval Measured from the beginning of the down stroke of the 
Q wave to t
he completion of the T wave; 
 QTc (Bazett) QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett’s formula  
(QT/square 
root of RR); 
 QTc (Fridericia) QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s  
formula (QT/cube root of RR) (for safety monitoring/subject 
discontinuation purposes). 
At screening (ba
seline assessment), a QTcF interval greater 
than [ADDRESS_724636] from study
 participation 
(see exclusion criterion #6 in Section  11.2.2).  In such cases, 
[ADDRESS_724637] should be judged a screen failure. 
During the treatment phase of the study, when any QTcF 
interval exceeds 495 msec, 2 additional ECGs should be 
taken at 10- to 15-minute intervals.  The QTcF
 interval on 
all 3 ECGs should be confirmed by [CONTACT_551565].  If it is determined that 2 of the 3 QTcF 
intervals exceed 500 msec or >25% above
 screen value, then

Attention is directed to the basic elements that are required in the informed consent under 
US Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a]).  Additional 
elements of infor
med consent, if appropriate, must be included in the informed consent 
document (21 CFR 50.25[b]).  A standard Informed Consent document will be approved by a

16.6 Outside Monitoring  
16.6.1 Medical Monitor 
The Sponsor’s (USWM) Medical Monitors,  and/or  
will be responsible for 
attempting to establish concurrence with the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551494] a
nd seriousness of any AEs and SAEs, the relatedness to the 
study treatments, the expectedness of the event, and for determining if an SAE should be 
reported to the FDA in a 7- or 15-day expedited report or an annual report ( Appendix 7).  
The Sponsor’s Medical Monit
or will also be responsible for tracking and assessing trends in 
the SAEs reported.  Furt
her, the Medical Monitor is available to consult with the Principal 
Investigators and coordinators on any medical issues related to the study (e.g., admission 
criteria, concomitant medications) and can be r
eached at

16.6.[ADDRESS_724648].  Using an RBM approach, 
monitoring may also occur remotely.  Moni
toring both on site and via an RBM approach will 
provide an opportunity for evaluation of the progress of the study and to inform the Sponsor 
of potential problems. 
The study will be monitored accor
ding t
o an approved monitoring plan.  The monitors will 
assure that defined data outlined in the monitoring plan are accurate and in agreement with 
source documentation; verify that investigational agents are properly stored and accounted 
for; verify that subjects’ consent for study participation has been properly obtained and 
documented; confirm that research subjects entered into the study meet inclusion and 209229

In lieu of an investi
gator meeting, USWM will host a web-based initiation meeting with 
study sites providing at a minimum protocol training, GCP training, CRF completion 
training, and a review of monitoring expectations.  For sites that did not participate in study 
USWM-LX1-3003-1, monitors will additionall
y conduct a site initiation visit before the start 
of the study.  At this visit, the monitor will assure that proper study-related documentation 
exists, assist in training investigators and other site personnel in study procedures and GCP 
guidelines, confirm receipt of study supplies, and assure that acceptable facilities are 
available to conduct the study. 
Periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_551569].  At the end 
of the study, they will advise on storage of study records and return of unused study agents.  
All sites should anticipate visits by [CONTACT_1034], its representatives, and the FDA. 
16.7 Adverse Event Reporting  
In accordance with FDA reporting requirements, all AEs occurring during the course of the 
clinical trial will be collected, documented, and reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-
investigators according to the specific instructions detailed in this section of the protocol and 
Appendix 7.  The occurrence of AEs will be assessed starting at the treatment phase of the 
protocol (i.e., with the first dose of study drug).  An
y AE that occurs during screening will be 
recorded in the subject’s Medical Hist
ory e
CRF.  The occurrence of Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) will be assessed after signing of the informed consent form. 
An AE is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course 
of the clinical trial, whether or not the event is considered related to the investigational agent 
or clinically significant.  For this st
udy, events reported by [CONTACT_423], as well as clinically 
significant abnormal findings in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_551495], laboratory evaluation, or C-SSRS (for example, score of 3 or more on the scale) 
will be considered an AE and will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  A new illness, symptom, 
sign or clinically significant clinical laboratory abnormality or worsening of a pre-existing 
condition or abnormality is considered an AE.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_551496]
d on the Medical History eCRF and such symptoms 
will be recorded as AEs during the study even if they do not change or worsen.  Stable 
chronic conditions, such as arthritis, which are pr
esent before entry into the clinical trial and 
do not worsen  are not considered AEs. 
For each daily AE assessment, details will be record ed in the subject’s source document and 
AE e CRF  regarding
 the type of AE and whether serious (SAE) or non-serious, severity of 
each AE, 
and the relationship to the study a
gent.  These categories are asking for the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551497]’s  best judgment of the severity and relatedness 
of ea
ch AE.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551489], based on 
his/
her best judgment, whether the AE is secondar

should not be marked as withdrawal related AND related to s
tudy medication.  Also, if the [ADDRESS_724649] review the AE eCRF for any events that are 
reported as beginning or as continuing.  All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal 
findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed by a study 
physician until satisfactory resolution. 
16.8 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Each adverse event or reaction will be classified by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_551498]-serious.  Based on the seriousness of the adverse event or reaction, 
appropriate reporting procedures 
will be followed. 
The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 part 312.32 and ICH Guideline for Industry: 
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, 
ICH-E2A March 1995, as implemented by [CONTACT_941] U S FDA, defines a serious adverse event 
(SAE) or serious adverse drug experience as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose 
that: 
 results in death during the period of protocol-defined surveillance; 
 is life
-threatening; (NOT E: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" 
refers to an event in which the subject, in the view of the Investigator, was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might hav
e caused death if it were more severe.)  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
 result
s in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or 
 result
s in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Importa
nt medical events that may not result in death, be life–threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_551499], based on appropriate medical judgment, the 
event may jeopardize the subject and might r
equire medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
An unex
pected event is one that is not described with respect to nature, severity, or frequency 
in the product package insert or Investigator’s Brochure. 
All subjects with SAEs must be followed up for outcome.  If a study subject withdraws from 
the study or if an investigator decides to discontinue the subject from the study because of a 
SAE, the subject must have appropriate follow-up medical monitoring including, if 
necessary, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Reporting requirements for SAEs are described in detail in Appendix 7.  There can be serious 
consequences including ultim
ately, criminal and/or civil penalties for sponsors who fail to 
comply with FDA regulations governing
 the reporting of SAEs to the FDA.  Any SAEs, 
including death due to any cause, which occu
rs to any subject entered into treatment in this [ADDRESS_724650] be reported 
withi n 24 hours, from the time any study staff member is made aware of such, to the Sponsor 
(USWM). 
16.9 Pregnancy 
Although pregnancy is not considered a n AE, it is the responsibility of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee to report any pregnancy in a subjec t (spontaneously reported 
to them or discovered during a protocol-defined pregnancy test) that occurs during the study 
or withi n [ADDRESS_724651] make appropriate 
effort (i.e., monthly calls) to follow the subject unti l completion/terminatio n of the 
pregnancy.  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome ( health of infant) must also be

usual standard of care in inpatient/outpatient detoxification from 
short -acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a variety of clinical situations in which  the 
subject is experiencing opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351], excluding only co -
administration of methadone.  Section 3, Page 6, Objective  
To primary objective of this study is to continue to investigate the 
safety of lofexidine when administered for at least 7 days at 
clinically relevant doses (3.2 or 2.4 mg/day) to alleviate symptoms 
of acute withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a variety of clinical scenarios 
in both in -clinic  and outpatient settings.  The effectiveness is also of 
interest. The primary objective is to investigate  whether variable 
dose lofexidine treatment can be safely and effectively used along

This section provides a summary of major changes made in this current amendment (No. 01) 
to the protocol for Study USWM- LX1-3003-2.  Section 23 provides a detailed accounting of 
all changes made in this amendment.  
AMENDMENT No. 0 1: RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES  
•The protocol was revised to allow enrollment of subjects with clinical treatment g oals 
for full or partial withdrawal from any opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (including methadone and 
buprenorphine), which would be expected to elicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_551525] f or at l east [ADDRESS_724772]-a ssisted total withdrawal, dose reduction of maintenance  
treatment ( e.g., methadone, buprenorphine), and transition from an opi[INVESTIGATOR_551526].  An attempt will be  made t o 
include a minimum of 50 subjects e ach treated  for clinical s cenarios involving  
methadone 
or buprenorphine treatment (i.e., a total of 50 subjects receiving full or 
partial dose reduction from methadone, methadone-assisted withdrawal, 
and other  
methadone treatment scenarios and a total of 50 subjects receiving full or partial dose 
reduction from buprenorphine, transition to buprenorphine maintenance, and other  
buprenorphine treatment scenarios).  The change was introduced to enable the 
study 
of lofexidine’s utility in
 any situation in which mitigation  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_551527].  Both  
buprenorphine and methadone clinical scenarios are being evaluated as clinically  
relevant scenario
s where l ofexidine’s use is likely.   Results of prio r interaction  studies  
do not suggest a significant safety concern with coadministration of lofexidine 
and 
both methadone and buprenorphine.  Further evaluation of the safety and clinical  
utility of lofexidine coadministered with methadone or buprenorphine will help 
confirm that a contraindication for use of lofexidine w ith agonists is unnecessary .
•The protocol w as
 revised to  use the  Mini I nternational N europsychiatric Interview  
(M.I.N.I.) rather than
 the Structured Clinica l Interview for D SM -IV-TR Axis  I 
Disorders (SCID) to establish the appropriate dependence diagnosis on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
exclude other drug dependency, and determine the absence of major psychiatric  
disorders.  M.I.N.I. is being used for consistency with eligibility assessment in  
companion study, USWM-L X1-3003-1.  Like SCID, the M.I.N.I. is a validated scale  
(Sheehan et al., 1998) and is commonly used in clinical practice and research studies.
•Number of subjects n eeded for enrollment was i ncreased from  200 to 400 to
250 t o 500 based on the 
projected number of subjects completing 7 days of lofexidine  
treatment in the companion study (
USWM-L X1-3003-1 ) and FDA’s safety  database  
requirements.  Enrollment in USWM-L X1-3003-[ADDRESS_724773] 7 days. 209229

Protocol No. USWM -LX1-3003- 2, Amendment No. 01  January 22, 2015 
 
Confidential Information   Page 4 of 113 • Number of study sites was increased from 10 to approximately 20 to account for the 
potentially higher enrollment requirements and target study completion timelines. 
• The protocol was revised from flexible dosing to standardized dosing of 7 days of 
lofexidine treatment, starting at 3.2 mg daily (0.8 mg QID), with lowering of the dose 
allowed to 2.4 mg daily (0.6 mg QID) if required for to lerability based on the 
subject’s individual treatment goal and response per clinical judgment of the Principal 
Investigator.   The standard dosing approach is being adopted to limit variability 
across sites and treatment scenarios to ensure interpretability of safety data at clinically relevant doses and to evaluate the same doses as used in the controlled programs with demonstrated efficacy. 
• The protocol was revised to require 3 days of mandatory in-clinic (inpatient 
housing/clinic facilities ) treatment with lofexidine (Days 1- 3) and then, per clinical 
judgment of the Principal Investigator, subjects can continue to receive all 4 daily 
doses of lofexidine in the clinic  or can be treated as outpatients for the remaining 
4 days of mandatory lofexidine treatment (Days  4-7).  Subjects can continue 
receiving lofexidine on a semi-standardized taper in an outpatient setting as long as acute withdrawal symptoms persist at the Principal Investigator’s discretion; 
however, in no event is treatment to exceed an additional 7  days  (maximum of 
14 days treatment over entire study).  The required initial 3  days of in- clinic  treatment 
was introduced to enable more frequent safety monitoring during anticipated peak withdrawal and initiation of lofexidine therapy.  Outpa tient treatment for continuation 
of therapy begins at Day 4 to enable assessment, as clinically appropriate at the discretion of the Principal Investigator, in a more flexible, real -world setting as 
patients with a variety of treatment goals, as being stud ied in the current design, may 
not require a longer- term clinic stay and in many situations it may be impractical to 
require inpatient treatment for more than a few days (e.g., work schedules). 
• The protocol was revised to require daily (rather than every other day) assessments, 
including during in- clinic treatment and at daily clinic visits during outpatient 
treatment.  As the primary objective of the study is to assess safety of lofexidine at 
clinically relevant doses, daily evaluations regardless of inpat ient or outpatient status 
are appropriate.  
• The Short Opi[INVESTIGATOR_551453] (SOWS -Gossop) was added because 
this scale has been evaluated in nearly all other lofexidine studies in opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351], serving as the instrument to evaluate efficacy  as the primary endpoint in 
the 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_551455]; and the SOWS-Gossop data will be used to evaluate lofexidine’s effectiveness in a variety of open -label clinical scenarios 
studied under the current protocol. 209229

Protocol No. USWM -LX1-3003- 2, Amendment No. 01  January 22, 2015 
Confidential Information  Page 5 of 113 •Requirements for vital signs were expanded during in-c linic treatment w ith 
lofexidine, similar to requirements in the companion study ( USWM-L X1-3003-1). 
Also a subject diary (Appendix 3) was added if the required post-dose blood 
pressure/pulse m easurement cannot be o btained in  the c linic.  T hese c hanges w ere 
introduced to ensure the most robust safety data collection possible 
during the
in-clinic portion of the study and providing a mechanism for additional data 
collection in the outpatient s etting, consistent w ith  the primary  objective of the study.
•A fingerprick blood sample concurrently with each scheduled ECG was added to  
enable Q Tc-concentration analyses.
•A fingerprick blood sample was added for analysis of plasma 
lofexidine 
concentration to monitor compliance during outpatient treatment.
•Columbia S uicide S everity
 Rating Scal e (C-S SRS) was a dded as a s afety assessment,  
consistent with
 the c urrent guidance to assess suicidality in all clinical studies  
involving central nervous system acting drugs. [ADDRESS_724774] 7 days at clinically relevant doses 
(3.2 or 2.4 mg/day) to alleviate symptoms of acute withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a variety of clinical scenarios in both in -clinic  and outpatient settings.  
The effectiveness of lofexidine is also of interest.  
Study Design  Multicenter, open -label study in the [LOCATION_002] in which subjects will  
receive lofexidine treatment for 7 days, starting at a dose of 3.2 mg daily (0.8 mg QID), with lowering of the dose allowed to 2.4 mg daily (0.6 mg QID) if required for tolerability based on the subject’s individual treatment 
goal and response per clinica l judgment of the Principal Investigator.  Note 
that all subjects will start lofexidine administration (Day  1) on the first day 
of his/her planned opi[INVESTIGATOR_551457]/discontinuation regardless of the clinical situation in which the subject is se eking treatment (see 
Inclusion Criterion No. 3).  All subjects will receive all [ADDRESS_724775] 3  days (Days 1 -3) and then, per 
clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator, subjects can continue to 
receive lofexidine doses in a clinic setting or can be treated outside of the clinic (outpatient) for the remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine treatment (Days  4-7).  Per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], subjects can 
continue lofexidine treatment beyond Day 7 on an outpatient basis
 only for 
up to an additional 7 days  (Days  8-14).  Note that lofexidine dosing may be 
stopped at any time during Days 8-14.  No subject will receive lofexidine for more than [ADDRESS_724776] is 
not dosed within this window as a result of completion of confirmatory vital sign assessments (Section  10.4), this will not constitute as a protocol 
deviation.  Source documents must note, however, the reason for dose delay.  For subjects receiving outpatient treatment (elective) on Days 4-7 and those continuing lofexidine treatment in a mandatory outpatient setting for up to an additional 7 days (Days 8-14), prescribed dosing will remain on the same QID schedule (8  AM, 1  PM, 6  PM, 11 PM).

WBC White Blood Cell  [ADDRESS_724797] 7  days at clinically relevant doses ( 3.2 or 2.4 mg/day ) to alleviate symptoms of 
acute withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a variety of clinical scenarios in both in -clinic  and 
outpatient settings.  The effectiveness of lofexidine is also of interest.   
8 STUDY SPONSOR  
This study will be conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application (#47,857) held by [CONTACT_351760], LLC. 
9 STUDY SITES AND INVE STIGATORS  
This study will be conducted at approximately 20 study sites in the US.  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigators to make sure this protocol is conducted in full 
conformance with the ethical principles detailed in Section 16 of this protocol.  All data will 
be collected at the study sites on source documents and entered at the site into electronic case report forms (eCRFs) as described in Section  18.[ADDRESS_724798] seeking treatment for partial or total opi[INVESTIGATOR_551529] .  This can include a variety of clinical situations where opi[INVESTIGATOR_551530], such as (but not limited to) abrupt and total withdrawal (including from 
methadone and buprenorphine), agonist- assisted total withdrawal, dose reduction of 
maintenance treatment (e.g.,  methadone, buprenorphine), and transition from an opi[INVESTIGATOR_551531].  Subjects will be evaluated for their 
compliance with protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria during a screening period, lasting up to 
9 days.  Approximately 250 to 500 subjects will receive lofexidine treatment for 7 days, starting at a dose of 3.2 mg daily (0.8 mg QID), with lowering of the dose allowed to 2.4 mg 
daily (0.6 mg QID) if required for tolerability based on the subject’s individual treatment 
goal and response per clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator.  Lo fexidine 
administration should be initiated in concurrence with the change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551532] (e.g. , first day of dose reduction, or first day of 
abrupt cessation) or on the first day of emergence/anticipated emergence of such symptoms as determined at the Investigator’s discretion.  Details regarding the timing of lofexidine 
therapy initiation relative to change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551468]/expected onset of symptoms should be captured in the source.  All subjects will receive all [ADDRESS_724799] 3  days (Days 1-3) and then, per clinical judgment of the Principal 
Investigator, subjects can continue to receive lofexidine doses in a clinic setting or can be 
treated outside of the clinic (outpatient) for the remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine 209229
uswm-lx1-3003-2-protocol-and-amendments  Pg. 143
Protocol No. USWM -LX1-3003- 2, Amendment No. 01  January 22, 2015 
Confidential Information  Page 23 of 113 treatment (Days  4-7).  Per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], subjects can continue lofexidine 
treatment beyond Day 7 on an outpatient basis  only for up to an additional 7 days 
(Days  8-14) .  Note that l ofexidine dosing may be stopped at any time during Days 8-14.  No 
subject will receive lofexidine for more than 14  days total.  All subjects receiving lofexidine 
treatment on an outpatient basis will be required to return to the clinic daily to undergo 
specific assessments (including qualitative urine drug screening) as listed in  Table [ADDRESS_724800] drop- out rates in this protocol.  
Enrollment will continue until a minimum total of 300 subjects (across this protocol and 
earlier lofexidine clinical studies expected to meet FDA safety database requirements) have 
been treated with  clinically relevant doses of  lofexidine for a minimum of [ADDRESS_724801] up to 9 days, followed by [CONTACT_8622] 14 days of treatment with lofexidine. 
The study will be terminated when the database i s judged to be sufficient, i.e., a minimum of 
300 subjects (across this protocol and earlier lofexidine clinical studies expected to meet 
FDA safety database requirements) have been treated with  clinically relevant doses of  
lofexidine for a minimum of 7 days.  Enrollment is anticipated to take 4 to 10 months to 
achieve, with the total clinical duration of USWM- LX1-3003-2 anticipated to be 8 to 
12 months. 
10.4 Dose Hold and Discontinuation Criteria (2 of 3 Rule) 
When a blood pressure, heart rate, or QTcF interval  value meets criteria for withholding a 
dose (Section  13.2.2)  or discontinuation from the study (Section 13.2.3) , the value needs to 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_551554], approximately 10 to 15 minutes later.  If the value is confirmed by [CONTACT_551610], the appropriate action will be taken (dose hold or study discontinuation) and the confirmatory value will be recorded in the subject’s source document and appropriate 
eCRF.  If the second value does not meet the specified criteria, a third measurement will be taken  approximately 10 to 15 minutes later.  If this value is confirmatory, the appropriate 
action will be taken (dose hold or study discontinuation) and the last confirmatory value will be recorded in the subject’s source document and appropriate eCRF.   If the third value does 
not confirm the initial finding, then no action should be taken and the third value should be 
entered in the subject’s source and appropriate eCRF.  [ADDRESS_724802]’s e CRF as an adverse event 
(AE) or s erious adverse event (SAE), as applicable.   Examples are:

12.3 Blinding Plan  
This is an open -label study. 
12.4 Labeling  
The investigational agent, lofexidine, will be packaged in lab eled bottles (80 count pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) and 
during the outpatient portion of the study dispensed to subjects in labeled prescription bottles 
(i.e., redispensing container) .  The product label will include the sponsor’s name, protocol 
number, the number of tablets in the bottle, address, 24-hour emergency phone number, and the following statement – “Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_59217].” 
During outpatient treatment (Days 4-14), sites may dispense 1 to 2 days of medication at 
each daily clinic visit to accommodate flexible scheduling for use in an outpatient setting 
(e.g., day and a half worth of medication to supply subject from one morning to the next afternoon depending on availability for clinic visit).  In such cases, the redispensing container will include a s ubject label, supplied by [CONTACT_3452], and will include the following 
information : 
• Principal Investigator ’s name [CONTACT_114040], 
• Subject number, 
• Date of dispensing, 
• Directions for use, 
• Drug name / dose or protocol number, 
• Number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_91383] , 
• Sponsor’ s name, and  
• 
For Investigational Use Only.  
12.5 Storage  
The investigational agent, lofexidine, will be stored at 68-77°F in a secure location at the dispensing pharmacy or site.  Temperature of the investigational agent will be maintained at 68-77°F during transport.  Temperature of the investigational agent will be monitored during storage and transport.  Temperature excursions will be reported to the Sponsor and the Sponsor will determine if the investigational agent is fit for use.  
12.[ADDRESS_724812] of Administration  
Accurate recording of all investigational agent re ceived, dispensed, administered, and 
returned will be maintained by [CONTACT_26271].  During outpatient treatment (Days  4-14), subjects are to record doses taken in his/her subject diary. 209229

Confidential Information   Page 29 of 113 12.7 Used/Unused Supplies  
Unused investigational agent will be retained at the participating sites to enable a full 
investigational drug inventory by [CONTACT_30107]’ respective monitor.  If any investigational agent is 
lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented.  The Sponsor will provide instructions to return the unused study drug to the pharmacy coordinating center periodically throughout the study (following monitor review) or at the end of the study for proper destruction in accordance with local and federal regulations. 
12.8 Contraindications  
Clonidine is specifically prohibited in this study.  
To avoid drug-drug interactions, lofexidine should not be administered concurrently with: 
• tricyclic antidepressants – may reduce the efficacy of imidazoline derivatives; and  
• beta- receptor blockers – the combination of lofexidine and beta- receptor blockers 
should be used with caution to avoid the risk of excessive bradycardia.  
Lofexidine may enhance the effects of antihypertensive drug therapy and appropriate caution is warranted in subjects on such therapy.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551513]’s antihypertensive dose during the study. 
Lofexidine should generally not be administered concurrently with alcohol, sedatives, and 
anesthetics as these may interact with lofexidine and enhance its central sedative effects.  
13 TREATMENT PLAN 
13.1 Investigation al Agent  
All subjects in this study will receive lofexidine, as described in Section  13.2. 
13.2 Dose Administration  
13.2.1 Administration of Doses  
Lofexidine administration should be initiated in concurrence with the change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551532] (e.g., first day of dose reduction, or first day of abrupt cessation) or on the first day of emergence/anticipate d emergence of such 
symptoms as determined at the Investigator’s discretion.  Details regarding the timing of lofexidine therapy initiation relative to change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_551468]/expected onset of symptoms should be captured in the source.  All subjec ts will take lofexidine orally for 
7 days, starting on Day 1 at a dose of 3.2 mg per day (0.8 mg QID), with lowering of the dose allowed to 2.4 mg daily (0.6 mg QID) if required for tolerability based on the subject’s individual treatment goal and response per clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator.  
The subject’s dose may be changed back to 3.2 mg/day, per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], 
but in no case is the dose of lofexidine to exceed 3.2 mg/day (or a single dose of 0.8 mg).  
Supporting rationale for  any dose changes must be recorded in the subject’s source 
document. [ADDRESS_724813] 3 days  
(Days  1-3) and then, per clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator, subjects can continue 
to receive lofexidine doses in a clinic setting or can be treated outside of the clinic 
(outpatient) for the remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine treatment (Days 4-7).  Note that the decision to allow outpatient treatment should take into account the subject’s sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of the study medication (as observed over Days 1-3) and the subject’s potential for noncompliance.  Furthermore, the rationale for the decision to continue treatment through either an in- clinic  or outpatient setting must be documented in the 
subject’s source document.   
During in- clinic  treatment, subjects must take lofexidine within a [ADDRESS_724814]’s source 
document and in the e CRF.  For subjects receiving outpatient treatment (elective) on 
Days  4-7 and those continuing optional lofexidine treatment in an outpatient setting for up to 
an additional 7 days (Days 8-14), prescribed dosing will remain on the same QID schedule 
(8 AM, 1  PM, 6  PM, 11 PM) with compliance assessed at the next day’s clinic visit by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_9650], subject report of dosing in diary (Appendix 3), and a fingerprick blood sample to assess plasma lofexidine concentrations.  
Optional Outpatient Treatment  (Days 8 -14) 
Per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], subjects can continue lofexidine treatment on an outpatient basis for up to an additional [ADDRESS_724815]’s source document.  Note that lofexidine dosing may be stopped at any time during Days  8-14.  No subject will receive lofexidine for more than 14 days total in this study .

Confidential Information   Page 32 of 113 • QTcF >500 msec1 or >25% above screen value for  both males and females; or 
• Syncope. 
Additional disco ntinuation criteria based on cardiovascular events are: 
• New onset of clinically significant abnormal ECG per Investigator judgment 
(e.g., second or third degree heart block or uncontrolled arrhythmia, prolonged 
QTcF  interval).  
• Persistent symptomatic hypote nsion ( e.g., hypotension not responding to bed rest or 
fluids).  
• Single occurrence of symptomatic bradycardia ( as assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_97159]/study physician/assigned staff, regardless of blood pressure) associated with chest pain, shortness of breath, or decreased level of consciousness.  
• Persistent hypertension – resting blood pressure ≥185/[ADDRESS_724817] 5 minutes apart AND within a 1-hour time period.  If 2 of 3 readings ar e ≥185/110 mmHg (either systolic ≥185 mmHg or diastolic 
≥110 mmHg) the  subject must be discontinued. 
• Medical Intervention for Cardiovascular Event:  Any medical intervention (nonmedication or medication inclusive) used for the treatment of any cardiovascular event, with the exception of a positional intervention in subjects displaying hypotension. 
• Any other clinically significant cardiovascular signs or symptoms that would place the 
subject at risk.  
• Subject misses more than a total of [ADDRESS_724818] 3  days of 
lofexidine treatment (Days  1-3) and then, per clinical judgment of the Princip al Investigator, 
subjects can continue to receive lofexidine doses  in a clinic setting  or can be treated outside 
of the clinic (outpatient) for the remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine treatment (Days  4-7).  Per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_137929], subjects can continue lofexidine treatment 
beyond Day 7 on an outpatient basis
 only for up to an additional 7 days (Days 8- 14).  No 
subject will receive lofexidine for more than 14  days total.  In an in- clinic  setting, each dose 
will be observed by [CONTACT_551611].  In an outpatient setting, self-dosing compliance will be evaluated at the next day’s clinic visit by 
[CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_692] , subject report of dosing in diary ( Appendix 3), and a fingerprick blood sample to 
assess plasma lofexidine concentrations.  Subjects  will be instructed to call the Principal 
Investigator’s  office before taking the next dose of study medication if they notice any 
symptoms of hypotension and/or bradyca rdia (see list in Section  
13.2.2) , especially when

13.4 Nicotine Replacement Therapy  
Subjects may be permitted to smoke during their in-clinic  participation in  study based on 
individual site policy.  If they usually use tobacco products, they will be offer ed and 
encouraged to use nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gum, inhaler, or nasal spray) while they are  in the in -clinic facility  to treat their nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  If smoking is 
permitted by a participating site, smoking breaks outside of the in- clinic  facility  must be 
constantly observed and supervised. 
The estimated total number of tobacco products used by [CONTACT_551560]- clinic  
treatment will be recorded in the subject’s source document and on the eCRF. 
[ADDRESS_724820] Recruitment and Consent 
Interested subjects, who respond to recruitment materials and  are available to stay for the 
mandatory 3-day in -clinic  treatment part of the study and available for participation in either 
an in- clinic  or outpatient setting for 4 additional days (total commitment of 7  days) , will be 
scheduled to meet with a qualified  investigative staff member and receive an explanation of 
the study purpose and requirements in lay language.  During the initial interview, the 
interviewer should not ask questions in a manner that reveals the eligibility criteria for study entry. 
If stil l interested after receiving an explanation of the study, a qualified investigative site staff 
member will review the study informed consent form with subjects, and subjects will be 
given an opportunity to review on their own, inquire about, and sign the informed consent form  (see Section  16.4 ).  The subject will then be given a copy of the signed consent form.  
After that, subjects will be given a subject number and proceed to the screening phase of the 
study.  Screening assessments must be completed within a 9-day time period, but can be completed as early as the first screening day .  At no time during the screening process should 
individuals be given information regarding inclusion or exclusion criteria.  When individuals are evaluated, questions should be asked in a way that the criteria are not discern ible. 
Any subject who has difficulty understanding the information contained in the consent form will reread the  misunderstood portion(s) of the consent and discuss with a research staff 
member until s/he shows complete understanding of the information in the consent form, and may thus give full consent.  Research staff will work closely with the subject in an effor t to 
help them understand the requirements of their participation.  Subjects with literacy problems will be assisted to the extent possible.  
Any subject who is unable to demonstrate understanding of the information contained in the informed consent will be excluded from study participation and assisted in finding other [ADDRESS_724821]’s sole expense.  Subjects who are excluded, or who 
decline participation, may be rescreened at a later time, although at least [ADDRESS_724822] occur 
between screenings.  Subjects who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.  
14.2 Screening  
Screening assessments will be conducted as shown in  Table 1  (Section 15).  The screening 
period will last up to [ADDRESS_724823] satisfy the eligibility criteria and complete all required screening assessments.  
14.3 Treatment Phase  
14.3.1 Days 1- 3 (Manda tory In- clinic ) 
After a potential participant has completed all screening assessments and has met all eligibility criteria to participate in the study,  the Principal I nvestigator or study coordinator 
will arrange for admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_551477] (Day - 1) or early morning 
(Day  1) before study drug administration on Day 1.  After all Baseline requirements have 
been completed (Section 15.2), subje cts will receive their first dose of lofexidine during the 
8 AM dosing window on Day 1.  Subjects will be dosed 4 times daily  from Day  1 through 
Day 3 at 8 AM , 1 PM , 6 PM , and 11 PM .  Vital signs will be recorded within 30 minutes 
before every dose and 3.5  hours (±15 minutes) after the [ADDRESS_724824] dose on Day  1 (8 AM) and 3.5 hours 
(±15 minutes) after dosing.  Other clinical assessments will be gathered between 11: 00 AM 
and noon each day  (see a complete list of assessments in  Table 1 ).  These clinical 
assessments are described in detail in Section s 15.3.5 and 15.5. 
14.3.2 Days 4- 7 (In -clinic/Outpatient)  
Per clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator, subjects can continue to receive 
lofexidine treatment  in a clinic setting or can be treated outside of the clinic  (outpatient) for 
the remaining 4 days of mandatory lofexidine treatment (Days 4-7).  Required clinical assessments are detailed  in Table [ADDRESS_724825] been completed (see Section  15.3.4).  
14.3.3 Days 8- 14 (Outpatient Only)

14.5.3 Trial Discontinuation  
The Sponsor (USWM) has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for 
terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• the incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to subjects; 
• subject enrollment is unsatisfactory;  
• data recording is inaccurate or incomplete ; and 
• the safety database is judged to be sufficient, i.e.,  a minimum of 300 subjects (across 
this protocol and earlier lofexidine clinical studies expected to meet FDA safety 
database requirements) have been treated with  clinically relevant doses of  lofexidine for 
a minimum of 7  days. 
14.6 Concomitant Therapy  
If the individual withdrawal treatment goal requires a specific concomitant medication 
(e.g., agonist- assisted total withdrawal, transition to buprenorphine or naltrexone, dose 
reduction of maintenance therapy), that concomitant medication is allowed.  At no time are 
clonidine, t ricyclic antidepressants, and beta- receptor blockers allowed (see Section  12.8).  
Other  concomi tant medications  or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_551533]-clinic  or outpatient setting , as clinically warranted .  The following medications were found 
to be useful in earlier lofexidine efficacy/safety studies and, for consistency, the Principal Investigator/study physician/assigned staff may consider their use in this study as appropriate. 
1. Guaifenesin (for cough).  
2. Alumina, Magnesia, and Simethicone (for emesis and nausea).  
3. Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and p syllium  hydrocolloid suspension (for constipation).  
4. Bismuth sulfate (Pepto -Bismol ®) and loperamide (Imodium®) (for diarrhea).  
5. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (for headache, 
muscle aches, or other discomfort. 
6. Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], trazadone, and other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (for insomnia, depression, anxiety).   
The Principal Investigator /study physician/assigned staff  should contact [CONTACT_1034]’s

treatment status (e.g., relapse, current psychosocial treatment, successful entry  into a methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone program) . 
(t) Per Investigator judgment, subjects  can be discharged from the study after receipt of at least one dose  of study drug on Day  [ADDRESS_724838] a visit window of ±2 days.  Subjects will not be out of 
compliance if visit win dows extend because of extraordinary events that make it impossible 
for subjects to complete a screening within the ±2 -day window (e.g., holidays, vacations, 
personal emergencies).  Determination of the maximum visit window deviation is, however, 
at the di scretion of the medical monitor.  Written informed consent must be obtained from all 
study subjects before initiation of any study procedures. 
The following screening assessments must be completed  during screening after determining 
eligibility and  written informed consent is obtained:  height; weight; vital signs 
(sitting/standing blood pressure and pulse; respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]; and temperature); blood collection for 
standard clinical safety laboratory assessments (including hematology and biochemistry); urine sample for confirmatory drug testing, urinalysis, and pregnancy assessment (if female); 
and infectious disease assessment (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) and a chest x-ray if a past [COMPANY_003] skin 
test for tuberculosis was positive.  
The urine sample collected will be divided into two aliquots :  one sample will go to the 
central lab  for urinalysis; the other sample will be used 
for “dipstick” analysis of  pregnancy and qualitative drug screening. 
The assessments listed below must also be performed during screening. 
• 12-lead ECGs (in duplicate) will be done on one day during the screening period at 
8 AM and 11:30 AM. 
• Medical and smoking/alcohol history. 
• Comp lete physical examination .

This same assessment will be made at each visit during the 7  days of optional outpatient 
treatment (Days  8-14).  This assessment should be completed after the SOWS- Gossop and 
COWS assessments.  
15.4.2 Short Opi[INVESTIGATOR_136] e Withdrawal Scale of Gossop  (SOWS -Gossop) 
The SOWS-Gossop [ 16] will be completed by [CONTACT_218626], once daily at 3.5 hours 
(± 10 minutes) after the first dose of study medication  during in- clinic  treatment and once 
daily before dosing during out patient treatment.  Note that at the time of each daily 
evaluation, subjects should consider their symptoms over the last 24- hour period or since the 
last time the subject took this test.  Also, this scale should be completed before completion of 
the COWS . 
The SOWS- Goss op scale assesses subjective symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] ( Appendix  1).  
It is a subject -rated scale consisting of 10 items that are scored on a 4 -point scale of 0 = none, 
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe (minimum score of 0, maximum score of 30) (see 209229

15.4.3 Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433]  (COWS) 
The COWS [ 17] will be used to assess the effectiveness of lofexidine in alleviation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_48530], and will be completed after the SOWS -Gossop and before the assessment of 
completion of pre- defined withdrawal treatment goal.  It will be comp leted during screening, 
at baseline (before dosing on Day 1), once daily at 3.[ADDRESS_724852] dose of study 
medication during in- clinic  treatment,  and once daily before dosing during outpatient 
treatment.  The COWS is a clinician -administered instrument that rates 11 common opi[INVESTIGATOR_551536] ( Appendix 2 ).  These include:  resting pulse rate; sweating; 
restlessness; pupil size; bone or joint aches; runny nose or tearing; gastrointestinal (GI) upset; tremor; yawning; anxiety or irri tability; and gooseflesh skin.  The score for each item reflects 
the severity of the sign or symptom, and the total scores are grouped as mild (5-12 points), moderate (13 -24 points), moderately severe (25-36 points), and severe (>36 points). 
15.5 Safety Assessm ent Methods  
15.5.1 Adverse Events  
The occurrence of AEs will be assessed starting at the treatment phase of the protocol (i.e., with the first dose of study drug).  Any AE that occurs during screening will be recorded in the subject’s Medical History eCRF.  The occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be assessed after signing of the informed consent form.  
Adverse events will be assessed and recorded around the same time each day by [CONTACT_551586]- clinic  lofexidine  treatment.  If an AE requires medical attention, it should be 
reported to a study physician immediately .  A study physician or assigned staff must meet 
with the subject to assess all medical and psychiatric AEs reported by [CONTACT_423], as well as those recorded by [CONTACT_551612].  Adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_63397], 
“How have you been feeling since I saw you last?”  After current AEs are assessed, the study physician or assigned staff must review with the subject and assess any AEs unresolved from 
the previous day.  For each daily AE assessment, details will be recorded  in the subject’s 209229
uswm-lx1-3003-2-protocol-and-amendments  Pg. 168

type of AE and whether it is serious (SAE) or non-serious , severity of each AE, and the 
relationship to the study agent .  These categories are asking for the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551488] ’s best judgment of the severity and relatedness of each AE .  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551489], based on his/her best judgment, whether 
the AE is secondary to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  In general, an AE should 
not be marked as withdrawal related AND related to study medication. 
Any study subject with a related AE will be followed until the event is resolved to the 
satisf action of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238] S ponsor’s Medical Monitor.  If the AE is 
unrelated, the subject will be followed until medically stable, and then will be referred, at the 
subject’s sole expense, for ongoing care and/or treatment, which may include psychological and lifestyle counseling, support groups, or pharmacological and medical treatment. 
During outpatient treatment, subjects will be queried about AEs at each daily clinic visit.  All 
subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_551563]/or bradycardia (see list in Section 13.2.2) (especially on standing from a sitting or lying position) and delay additional lofexidine dosing until further instructed. 
All reported AEs will be recorded as described above.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal -Related Adverse Events 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551489], based on his/her best 
judgment, whether the AE is secondary to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351].  Individual items reported on the efficacy scales (i.e.,  SOWS -Gossop, COWS) do not
 automatically qualify as a 
withdrawal -related AE unless the subject speci fically reports them in response to the non-
leading question (i.e., “How have you been feeling since I saw you last?”).  In the event a subject reports “withdrawal” or a similar event encompassing a collection of potential withdrawal symptoms, the subject should be asked to elaborate so that each specific symptom can be recorded on the AE eCRF.  In general, an AE /SAE  should not be marked as 
withdrawal related AND related to study medication. 
15.5.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs ( sitting/standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse) will be measured at 
screening for all subjects . 
During in- clinic  treatment (Days  1-3 mandatory; Days  4-[ADDRESS_724853] receives all lofexidine 
doses in the clinic), resting (sitting [or recumbent if necessary because of an AE]) and standing (if able) systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse  will be measured within

Additionally, when the subject is experiencing blood pressure- or pulse- related symptoms 
(e.g., lightheaded, dizziness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]), these should be recorded on the subject’s e CRF as 
an AE or SAE (see Sections 15.5.1, 16.7, and 16.8)  even if the vital signs values do not meet 
the pre- defined criteria detailed in Sections 13.2.2 and 13.2.3. 
15.5.3 12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
Using the ECG core lab -provided and validated instruments, baseline paper tracing 12- lead 
ECG (in duplicate) will be conducte d on one day during the screening period at 8 AM and

8 AM and 3.5 hours (±15 minutes) after dosing; before the subject’s last  dose and after 
dosing; or, if applicable, at discontinuation from the study.  ECG intervals and abnormalities 
will be read centrally by a computer and confirmed by [CONTACT_551608] .  A qualified physician on site will evaluate tracings if there 
is a significant abnormality.  The f ollowing intervals will be computed: 
• Ventricular Rate  Number of R waves appearing within a 6-second period, 
multiplied by 10; 
• PR Interval  Measured from the onset of the P wave to the onset of the 
QRS complex ; 
• QRS Complex  Measured from the beginning of the down stroke of the 
Q wave to the completion of the upstroke of the S wave; 
• QT Interval  Measured from the beginning of the down stroke of the 
Q wave to the completion of the T wave; 
• QTc (Bazett)  QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett’s formula  
(QT/square root of RR); 209229

Annual reports and progress reports will be submitted to the IRB annually or at a frequency requested by [CONTACT_1201]. 
The IRB must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 
GCP  Title  21 Part  56 of the US CFR relating to IRBs and the ICH Guideline for GCP  (E6).  
16.4 Informed Consent/HIPAA Authorization  
Properly executed written informed consent, in compliance with [ADDRESS_724869] into the trial.  Attention is directed to the basic elements that are required in the informed consent under US Federal Regulations for Protection  of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a]).  Additional 
elements of informed consent, if appropriate, must be included in the informed consent document (21 CFR 50.25[b]).  A standard Informed Consent document will be approved by a central IRB.  Any study site th at requires a site-specific Informed Consent document must 
have the document approved by [CONTACT_551614]’s IRB. T he final 
IRB-approved document must be provided to the Sponsor for regulatory purposes. 
All potential subjects for th e study will be given a current copy of the Informed Consent 
Form to read.  The Principal Investigator, sub- investigators, or study physician at each site 
will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and answer all of the subject’s questions 
regar ding the study.  If the subject desires to participate in the study, s/he will be asked to 
sign the Informed Consent.  No subject will undergo any study procedures before signing the Informed Consent form, which should be signed before screening.  A signed copy will be given to the subject and a signed original shall be maintained in the subject’s clinical file as well as the Regulatory Binder at each study site.  Subjects who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.  
Each subject must also sign a HIPAA ( US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act) form before his/her participation in the study.  A signed copy must be provided to the 
subject and a signed original shall be maintained in the subject’s cl inical file.  
16.5 Drug Accountability  
All study drug required for completion of this study will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] (USWM).  Upon receipt, the investigator/pharmacist is responsible for taking inventory of

Confidential Information  Page 55 of 113 16.6 Outside Monitoring 
16.6.1 Medical Monitor  
The Sponsor’s ( USWM ) Medical Monitors,  
will be responsible for attempting to establish concurrence with the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551519], the relatedness to the 
study treatments, the expectedness of the event, and for determining if an  SAE should be 
reported to the FDA in a 7- or 15-day expedited report or an annual report (Appendix 7).  The Sponsor’s M edical Monitor will also be responsible for tracking and assessing trends in 
the SAEs reported.  Further, the Medical Monitor is availab le to consult with the Principal 
Investigators and coordinators on any medical issues related to the study (e.g., admission criteria, concomitant medications)  and can be reached at  
and/or  
16.6.[ADDRESS_724870].  Using an RBM a pproach, 
monitoring may also occur remotely.  Monitoring both on site and via an RBM approach will provide an opportunity for evaluat ion of the progress of the study and to inform the Sponsor 
of potential problems . 
The study will be monitored according to an approved monitoring plan.  The monitors will assure that defined data outlined in the monitoring plan are accurate and in agreement with 
source documentation; verify that investigational agents are properly stored and accounted 
for; verify that subjects ’ consent for study participation has been properly obtained and 
documented; confirm that research subjects entered into the study meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria ; and assure that all essential documentation required by [CONTACT_551615].  
In lieu of an investigator meeting, USWM will host a web- based initiation meeting with 
study sites providing at a minimum protocol training, GCP training, CRF completion training, and a review of monitoring expectations.  For sites that did not p articipate in study 
USWM -LX1-3003- 1, monitors will additionally conduct a site initiation visit before the start 
of the study.  At this visit, the monitor will assure that proper study -related documentation 
exists, assist in training investigators and othe r site personnel in study procedures and GCP 
guidelines, confirm receipt of study supplies, and assure that acceptable facilities are available to conduct the study.  
Periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_551569].  At the end of the study, they will advise on storage of study records and return of unused study agents.  All sites should anticipate visits by [CONTACT_1034], its representatives, and the FDA. 209229

Confidential Information   Page 56 of 113 16.7 Adverse Event Reporting  
In accordance with FDA reporting requirements, all AEs occurring during the course of the 
clinical trial will be collected, documented, and reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-
investigators according to the specific instructions detailed in this section of the protocol and 
Appendix 7.  The occurr ence of AEs will be assessed starting at the treatment phase of the 
protocol (i.e.,  with the first dose of study drug).  Any AE that occurs during screening will be 
recorded in the subject’s Medical History eCRF.  The occurrence of Serious Adverse Events 
(SAEs) will be assessed after signing of the informed consent form.  
An AE is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial, whether or not the event is considered related to the investigational a gent 
or clinically significant.  For this study, events reported by [CONTACT_423], as well as clinically significant abnormal findings in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_551495], laboratory evaluation, or C -SSRS (for example, score of 3 or more on the scale) 
will be considered an AE and will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  A new illness, symptom, sign or clinically significant clinical laboratory abnormality or worsening of a pre -existing 
condition or abnormality is  considered an AE.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_551538].  Stable chronic conditions , such as arthritis, which are present before entry into the clinical trial and 
do
 not worsen  are not considered AEs.  
For each daily AE assessment, details  will be recorded  in the subject’s source document and 
AE eCRF  regarding the type of AE and whether serious (SAE) or non-serious, severity of 
each AE, and the relationship to the study agent .  These categories are asking for the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_551539] ’s best judgment of the severity and relatedness 
of each  AE.  The Principal Investig ator or physician designee will also record, based on 
his/her best judgment, whether the AE is secondary to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351].  In general, an AE should not be marked as withdrawal related AND related to study medication.  Also, if the sign or symptom is e valuated as part of the COWS assessment, it should generally be 
considered as withdrawal related and so marked if it is also reported as an AE.  
A study physician or assigned staff must review the AE eCRF for any events that are reported as beginning or as continuing.  All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed by a study physician until satisfactory resolution.  
16.8 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Each adverse event or reaction will be classified by [CONTACT_45822] [INVESTIGATOR_551498] -serious.  Based on the seriousness of the adverse event or reaction, 
appropriate reporti ng procedures will be followed. 
The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 part 312.32 and ICH Guideline for Industry: 
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standar ds for Expedited Reporting, 
ICH- E2A March 1995, as implemented by [CONTACT_941] U S FDA, defines a serious adverse event 209229

Confidential Information   Page 57 of 113 (SAE) or serious adverse drug experience as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose 
that: 
• results in death  during the period of protocol- defined surveillance;  
• is life -threatening; (NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" 
refers to an event in which the subject , in the view of the Investigator, was at 
immediate  risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity; or 
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life –threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_551540], based on appropriate medical judgment, the 
event may jeopardize the subject and might require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
An unexpected event is one that is not described with respect to nature, severity, or frequency 
in the product package insert or Investigator’s Brochure. 
All subjects with SAEs must be followed up for outcome.  If a study subject withdraws from 
the study or if an investigator decides to discontinue the subject from the study because of a SAE, the subject must have appropriate follow-up medical monitoring including, if necessary, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Reporting requirements for SAEs are described in detail  in Appendix 7.  There can be serious 
consequences including ultimately, criminal and/or civil penalties for sponsors who fail to comply with FDA regulations governing the reporting of SAEs to the FDA.  Any SAEs, 
including death due to any cause, which occurs to any subjec t entered into treatment in this 
study or within [ADDRESS_724871] be reported 
within 24 hours, from the time any study staff member is made aware of such, to the Sponsor 
(USWM).  
16.9 Pregnancy  
Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022] /her designee to report any pregnancy in a subject (spontaneously reported 
to them or discovered during a protocol-defined pregnancy test) that occurs during the study 
or within [ADDRESS_724872] make appropriate 
effort (i.e ., monthly calls) to follow the subject until completion/termination of the 
pregnancy.  If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported to the Sponsor.  If the subject cannot be reached after [ADDRESS_724873] to censoring (e .g., time to 
removal from study t reatment ) will be summarized by [CONTACT_941] 25th percentile, median, 75th

Section 2, Page 3, Objective  
The primary objective is to investigate whether variable dose lofexidine treatment can be safely and effectively used along with 
usual standard of care in inpatient/outpatient detoxification from 
short-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a variety of clinical situations in which the 
subject is experiencing opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351], excluding only co-
administration of methadone.  Section 3, Page 6, Objective  
To primary objective of this study is to continue to investigate the safety  of lofexidine when administered for at least 7 days at 
clinically relevant doses (3.2 or 2.4 mg/day) to alleviate symptoms of acute withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_27262] a variety of clinical scenarios 
in both in-clinic  and outpatient settings.  The effectiveness is  also of 
interest.The primary objective is to investigate whether variable

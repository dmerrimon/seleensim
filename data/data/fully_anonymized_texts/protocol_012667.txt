The present 
approaches to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are 
limited and for some patients there are significant drawbacks that have not been resolved. 
It would be desirable to provide a source of relief for constipation that would permit 
dosing adjustments to optimize efficacy and safety and that would be pleasant to consume 
to improve patient compliance. The treatment should not have the safety issues associated 
with oral phosphate la
xatives, have an acceptable safety profile, and be effective in 
numerous types of constipation. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc. is investigating the use of a new chemical composition, 
BLI400 (La
ctitol Monohydrate NF Powder for Reconstitution) as a treatment for adult 
constipation.  Ample published literature with lactitol provides significant preclinical and 
clinical studies which support the safe and effective use of this GRAS-listed compound.  
These reports indicate that the BLI400 lactitol composition has promise as a candidate for 
further development for the treatment of constipation, as reviewed herein. 
BLI400 is a member of the pharmaceutica l class of osmotic laxative s; specifically it is a 
non-absorbe d, colonically metabolized suga r alcohol (poly ol). Studi es reviewed here 
indicate it provides relief from the symptoms of constipation by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_740458] a 
patient-controlled bowe l movement. While lactitol appears to be minimally, if at all, 
absorbed in the small intestine,  colonic microbes split lactitol into D-galactose and D-
sorbitol, which are fermentable to organic acids including lactic, formic, propi[INVESTIGATOR_58585], 
butyric and acetic acids (as reviewed in Patil et al, 1987 ).  The osmotic properties of the 
small organic molecules consistently point to their pharmacodynamic effects as dependent 
on water retention with the stool.  Thus, BLI400 is a pro-drug of an essentially non-
absorbed osmotic laxative . Lactitol is generally considered to be pharmacologically inert 
and is ofte
n referred to as a “prebiotic” with no specific receptor targets for its laxative 
action.  
Rationale for
 Performing Research with the Investigational Product 
Lactitol monohydrate, at a daily dose of 21 grams per day appears to be a safe and 
effective treatment for constipation, but it has not been studied and proven in clinical 
BLI400 (NDA 211281)

convert it into osmotically active small molecules. Extensive published and non-published 
literature supports its safety and efficacy, but a Phase III clinical trial is required for its 
registra
tion in the US.  It is envisaged there will be one, multi-site, controlled stud y in 
patients wi
th documented constipation and that the design will be similar to other studies 
that have led to the approval of laxatives, such as those for MiraLAX, NDA 22-015 and 
consistent wit
h FDA’s recommendations for study endpoints in CIC trials.  
 
Physical, Che
mical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation 
Lactitol is a simple monosaccharide sugar alcohol, a synthetic derivative of the milk sugar 
lactose that was discovered in the 1920s.  It is a dry, free flowing powder, readily soluble 
in aqueous soluti
ons.  As shown by [CONTACT_740464], it is an analog of the 
disaccharide lactulose.

Version dated 4-13-2016   Page 7 of 35 Nonclinical Studies:  Extensive nonclinical studies have been performed with lactitol as 
support for its reg
istration and marketing in countries outside the US and are reviewed in 
detail in the
 BLI400 Investigators’ Brochure.  The studies have covered basic 
pharmac
ology, genotoxicity and mutagenicity, acute and chronic studies including 
carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity.  These studies were carried out in mice, rats, 
dogs and rabbits. 
 
Pharmacology:  Lactitol is not degraded by [CONTACT_740465], colonic microflora degrade lactitol extensively in rats so that lactitol 
elevated the proportions of acetic acid and lowered proportions of butyric acid in the 
hindgut of rats. The osmotic effects of these organic acids appear to provide the 
pharmacodynamic basis for lactitol’s laxative action. Increased output of moist feces was 
seen in all animals species studied in a dose-related manner. The highest doses tested 
caused frank diarrhea in some studies. 
Metabolic Effects:  In some studies, total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were 
reduced equally in rats fed diets containing 7% sorbitol or lactitol.  By [CONTACT_740466], la
ctitol lower ed ammonia levels in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy, 
perhaps 
as a result of production of the poorly absorbed ammonium ion that follows 
lowering the cecal pH. Rats fed a diet containing 5% of lactitol for two weeks displayed a 
significa
nt increase of calcium absorption.  
Toxicology Studies:  Only weak edema ensued after lactitol application to intact skin, but 
ery
thema and edema emerged when it was applied to abraded skin. Rodents treated with 
lactitol had loose , frequent stools and cecal enlargement. This was often accompanied by 
[CONTACT_740467]. Clinical chemistry changes 
included changes in electrolyte levels, decreased cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase. 
Perhaps as compensation for the electrolyte changes that probably followed the diarrhea, 
adrenal weight and hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata were seen in the highest dose 
groups.  Renal tubular degeneration with nephrocalcinosis was occasionally seen and may 
follow the increased calcium absorption. Lactitol was not considered positive for 
mutagenicity or chromosomal damage studied in standard in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Life-long carcinogenicity studies have indicated that Leydig cell dysplasia occurred in 
BLI400 (NDA 211281)
Confidential  
Page [ADDRESS_1012239] in 
rodents.  
Clinical Phar
macology and Safety:  Since lactitol is extensively degraded to organic 
acids i
n the colon, it is little surprise that there are no published studies on its level in 
blood after administration.  Some have estimated that only 0.6% of an oral dose of lactitol 
is excreted in urine. Similar to what is found in animals, lactitol is extensively 
metaboliz
ed in the human colon, making available a significant proportion of the 
metabolites for colonic absorption. Unlike in animals, lactitol does not seem to stimulate 
calcium absor
ption in humans, although in one study when 15 g of lactitol was 
administered along with calcium in solution to fasting volunteers, calcium absorption was 
diminished.  Administering lactitol increases fecal Bifidobacteria levels, while other 
bacteria 
(fecal anaerobes, aerobes, Enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli) were unaffected. 
After the ingestion of 25 g lactitol, xylitol, or glucose by [CONTACT_740468] 30 and 60 minutes after ingestion of 
glucose while no rise in plasma glucose followed ingestion of lactitol.  
The investigation of the use of a mixture of lactitol for the treatment of constipation has been 
extensively studied, but the information is only available in published form. From these 
observations, it appears that lactitol’s adverse events are limited largely to the gastrointestinal 
system. Symptoms such as nausea, cramps, abdominal pain, flatulence and vomiting may be 
expected and could lead to withdrawal from the study if not controlled.  Their incidence and 
severity may be ameliorated in some patients by [CONTACT_2715]-adjustment.  Changes in hematology, 
clinica
l chemistry or urinalysis may be seen, and their clinical significance will be assessed 
during the development of lactitol.  In one study plasma potassium was elevated with lactitol, 
but the values stayed within the normal range. 
Clinical Efficacy:  Lactitol has been marketed since at least 1985 outside the US in 
Europe and other regions (where it is known as Lactitol Ex-Lax® or Importal®, for 
example) as a syrup or powder for the treatment of constipation in adults, including the 
elderly and children.  As a result a substantial body of evidence has accumulated on its

including two recent review articles (Maydeo, 2010; Faruqui and Joshi, 2012). 
A minimal effe

that a starting dose of [ADDRESS_1012240] indicated that 
this strategy can optimize therapy.  
Maydeo (2010) presented a systematic review of six published randomized, non-
randomized and open trials comparing the safety and efficacy of lactitol to those of 
lactulose. Overall, lactitol was compara ble to lactu lose in efficacy measures (normal stool 
consistency and number of bowel movement pe r week). Patients found lactitol to be more 
acceptable and were more compliant with it l argely due to its superior palatability (73.2 % 
vs. 26.8 %) . Lactitol was signific antly better than lactulose in the frequency of adverse 
events (31.2 ± 0.8 % vs. 62.1 ±1.1 %, p= 0.0019). The physicians’ assessment favored 
lactitol as compared to lactulose (61.91% vs. 47.83%).  The following table is adapted 
from Maydeo’s summary of the reviewed trials.

5.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting 
 
An Adve
rse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use  
of a drug in hum
ans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
finding), sympt
om, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product. 
 
Adverse event collection will coincide with the subject providing informed consent to 
participate in t
he study and will conclude with the end of study participation at Day [ADDRESS_1012259] date/time of report, date/time of onset, description of the adverse 
event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, action(s) 
taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and the Investigator's 
assessment of relationship of adverse event to study treatment. 
 
The Investigator should assess the severity of each adverse event using the following categories: 
 
Grade Severity Description  
1 
 Mild Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
Causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
Causing some limitations of usual activities  
3 
Severe Severe discomfort, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual  
activities 
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of death  
Life threatening or disabling  
5 Fatal Causes death of the participant

the following categories: 
 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. 
DEFINITE  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. 
 
In published Phase 3 studies, adverse events associated with BLI400 administered at 
doses require

A Se
rious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in at 
least one of the following outcomes: 
- Results in death 
- Is life-threatening 
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
- A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage 
 
SAE collection will coincide with the subject providing informed consent to participate in 
the study and 
will conclude [ADDRESS_1012260]’s last dose of study  medication. Shoul d 
a s
erious and/or unexpected adverse event occur, the Investigator must notify Braintree 
Laboratories immediately.  The Investigator will make a decision regarding continuing the 
subject’s study participation, and may request input from Braintree Laboratories. The 
Investigator will be responsible for recommending or providing the subject with appropriate 
medical therapy. All subjects experiencing serious adverse events will be followed until 
satisfactory resolution occurs. Braintree Laboratories must be kept apprised of all follow-ups 
relative to serious adverse events. In addition, Investigators must comply with the SAE 
reporting requirements of the Institutional Review Board with oversight of the study. 
 
Any serious and/or unexpected adverse events that occur during the study will be reported 
to Braintree Laboratories as follows:

Version dated 4-13-2016   Page 26 of 35 Adverse Events 
Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA classification to provide a preferred 
term and primary system organ class for each event.  Proportions of subjects with adverse 
events will be presented for the overall study population, and each demographic subgroup 
(age, gender and race). Tables of AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_39812], and include overall totals for AEs within each system organ class.  
Counting will be done by [CONTACT_740470].  A table of counts and percentages will 
also be made of those subjects with SAEs or AEs which led to withdrawal from the study.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as adverse events that had an onset day and time on 
or after the day and time of the first dose of study drug until the Day 374 Follow-up Call.  
Adverse Events having missing onset dates will be considered as treatment emergent. 
The difference in adverse event rates between study periods will be tested by [CONTACT_177610]-Square 
or Fisher’s exact test with 95% confidence intervals. 
Laboratory Parameters  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each laboratory parameter at each visit. Laboratory data 
will be summarized for the overall population and the elderly and non-elderly subgroups. 
When calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation within a visit window 
will be used if there are multiple observations.  Changes from baseline (Visit 1) will be 
presented in a similar format.  An additional listing will be provided of those subjects who 
have clinically significant laboratory values.  The data will also be presented as shift 
tables and clinically significant abnormalities will be examined. 
Results of laboratory tests for the change from baseline (Visit 1) and group differences 
will be tested using ANOVA.

The present approaches to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are 
limited and for some patients there are significant drawbacks that have not been resolved. 
It would be desirable to provide a source of relief for constipation that would permit 
dosing adjustments to optimize efficacy and safety and that would be pleasant to consume 
to improve patient compliance. The treatment should not have the safety issues associated 
with oral phosphate laxatives, have an acceptable safety profile, and be effective in 
numerous types of constipation.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc. is investigat ing the use of a new chemical composition, 
BLI400 (Lactitol Monohydrate NF Powder for Reconstitution) as a treatment for adult 
constipation.  Ample published literature with lactitol provides significant preclinical and 
clinical studies which sup port the safe and effective use of this GRAS -listed compound.  
These reports indicate that the BLI400 lactitol composition has promise as a candidate for 
further development for the treatment of constipation, as reviewed herein. 
BLI400 is a member of the p harmaceutical class of osmotic laxatives; specifically it is a 
non-absorbed, colonically metabolized sugar alcohol (polyol). Studies reviewed  here 
indicate it provides relief from the symptoms of constipation by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_740458] a 
patient-controlled bowel movement. While lactitol appears to be minimally, if at all, 
absorbed in the small intestine,  colonic microbes split lactitol into D -galactose and D -
sorbitol, which are fermentable to organic acids including lactic, formic, propi[INVESTIGATOR_58585], 
butyric and acetic a cids (as reviewed in Patil et al, 1987).  The osmotic properties of the 
small organic molecules consistently point to their pharmacodynamic effects as dependent 
on water retention with the stool.  Thus, BLI400 is a pro -drug of an essentially non -
absorbed o smotic laxative . Lactitol is generally considered to be pharmacologically inert  
and is often referred to as a “prebiotic” with no specific receptor targets for its laxative 
action.  
Rationale for Performing Research with the Investigational Product  
Lactitol monohydrate, at a daily dose of 21 grams per day appears to be a safe and 
effective treatment for constipation, but it has not been studied and proven in clinical 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential

Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 6 of 35 trials in the US. Lactitol appears to be a “prebiotic”, a substrate for colonic bact eria which 
convert it into osmotically active small molecules. Extensive published and non -published 
literature supports its safety and efficacy, but a Phase I II clinical trial is required for its 
registration in the US.  It is envisaged there will be one,  multi-site, controlled stud y in 
patients with documented constipation and that the design will be similar to other studies 
that have led to the approval of laxatives, such as those for MiraLAX, NDA 22 -015 and 
consistent with FDA’s recommendations for study endpoints in CIC trials .  
 
Physical, Chemical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation  
Lactitol is a simple monosaccharide sugar alcohol, a synthetic derivative of the milk sugar 
lactose that was discovered in the 1920s.  It is a dry, free flowing powder, readily soluble 
in aqueous solutions.  As shown by [CONTACT_740464], it is an analog of the 
disaccharide lactulose.

Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 7 of 35 Nonclinical Studies :  Extensive non clinical studies have been performed with lactitol as 
support for its registration and marketing in countries outside the US  and are reviewed in 
detail in the BLI400 Investigators’ Brochure .  The studies have covered basic 
pharmacology, genotoxicity and mutagenicity, acute and chronic studies including 
carcinogenicity and re productive toxicity.  These studies were carried out in mice, rats, 
dogs and rabbits.  
 
Pharmacology:  Lactitol is not degraded by [CONTACT_740465], colonic microflora degrade lactitol extensively in rats so that lactitol 
elevated the proportions of acetic acid and lowered proportions of butyric acid in the 
hindgut of  rats. The osmotic effects of these organic acids appear to provide the 
pharmacodynamic basis for lactitol’s laxative action. Increased output of moist feces was 
seen in all animals species studied in a dose -related manner. The highest doses tested 
caused frank diarrhea in some studies.  
Metabolic Effects: In some studies, total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were 
reduced equally in rats fed diets containing 7% sorbitol or lactitol .  By [CONTACT_740466], lactitol lowered ammonia levels in animal models of hepatic encephalopathy, 
perhaps as a result of production of the poorly absorbed ammonium ion that follows 
lowering the cecal pH. Rats fed a diet containing 5% of lactitol for two weeks displayed a 
significant increase of calcium absorption.  
Toxicology  Studies: Only weak edema ensued after lactitol application to intact skin, but 
erythema and edema emerged when it was applied to abraded skin. Rodents treated with 
lactitol had l oose, frequent stools and cecal enlargement . This was often accompanied by 
[CONTACT_740475]. Clinical chemistry changes 
included changes in electrolyte levels, decreased cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase. 
Perhaps as compe nsation for the electrolyte changes that probably followed the diarrhea, 
adrenal weight and hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata were seen in the highest dose 
groups.  Renal tubular degeneration with nephrocalcinosis was occasionally seen and may 
follow the  increased calcium absorption. Lactitol was not considered positive for 
mutagenicity or chromosomal damage studied in standard in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Life-long carcinogenicity studies have indicated that Leydig cell dysplasia occurred in 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI400 -[ADDRESS_1012271] in 
rodents.  
Clinical Pharmacology and Safety:  Since lactitol is extensively degraded to organic 
acids in the colon, it is little surprise that there are no published studies on its level in 
blood after administration.  Some have estimated that only 0.6% of an or al dose of lactitol 
is excreted in urine . Similar to what is found in animals, lactitol is extensively 
metabolized in the human colon, making available a significant proportion of the 
metabolites for colonic absorption.  Unlike in animals, l actitol does not  seem to stimulate 
calcium absorption in humans, although in one study when 15 g of lactitol was 
administered along with calcium in solution to fasting volunteers , calcium absorption was 
diminished .  Administering lactitol increases fecal Bifidobacteria  levels, while other 
bacteria ( fecal anaerobes, aerobes, Enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli ) were unaffected. 
After the ingestion of 25 g lactitol, xylitol, or glucose by [CONTACT_740468] 30 an d 60 minutes after ingestion of 
glucose while no rise in plasma glucose followed ingestion of lactitol.  
The investigation of the use of a mixture of lactitol for the treatment of constipation has been 
extensively studied, but the information is only avail able in published form. From these 
observations, it appears that lactitol’s adverse events are limited largely to the gastrointestinal 
system. Symptoms such as nausea, cramps, abdominal pain, flatulence and vomiting may be 
expected and could lead to withdr awal from the study if not controlled.  Their incidence and 
severity may be ameliorated in some patients by [CONTACT_2715] -adjustment .  Changes in hematology, 
clinical chemistry or urinalysis may be seen, and their clinical significance will be assessed 
during the d evelopment of lactitol.  In one study  plasma potassium was elevated with lactitol, 
but the values stayed within the normal range.  
Clinical Efficacy : Lactitol has been marketed since at least 1985 outside the US in 
Europe and other regions (where it is known as Lactitol Ex -Lax® or Importal®, for 
example) as a syrup or powder for the treatment of constipation in adults , including the 
elderly and children.  As a result a substantial body of evidence has accumulated on its 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential

Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 9 of 35 use in treating constipation, as e videnced by [CONTACT_726] 19 publications since 1988, 
including two recent review articles (Maydeo, 2010; Faruqui and Joshi, 2012).  
A minimal effective dose of 0.25 g/kg has been suggested, and most studies have found 
that a starting dose of [ADDRESS_1012272] indicated that 
this strategy can optimize ther apy.  
Maydeo (2010) presented a systematic review of six published randomized, non -
randomized and open trials comparing the safety and efficacy of lactitol to those of 
lactulose. Overall, lactitol was comparable to lactulose in efficacy measures (normal st ool 
consistency and number of bowel movement per week). Patients found lactitol to be more 
acceptable and were more compliant with it largely due to its superior palatability (73.2 % 
vs. 26.8 %). Lactitol was significantly better than lactulose in the freq uency of adverse 
events (31.2 ± 0.8 % vs. 62.1 ±1.1 %, p= 0.0019). The physicians’ assessment favored 
lactitol as compared to lactulose (61.91% vs. 47.83%).  The following table is adapted 
from Maydeo’s summary of the reviewed trials.

5.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use   
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant  abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
 
Adverse event collection will coincide with the subject providing informed c onsent to 
participate in the study and will conclude with the end of study participation at Day [ADDRESS_1012288] date/time of repor t, date/time of onset, description of the adverse 
event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, action(s) 
taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and the Investigator's

Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 22 of 35 The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event using 
the following categories:  
 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events).  
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. 
DEFINITE  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. 
 
In published Phase [ADDRESS_1012289] (IRB)  review and approval of the study protocol and Informed 
Consent Form will be obtained prior to initiation of the study.  Amendments to the study 
protocol and consent form generated during the course of the st udy will also require IRB 
approval. 
 
 
8. MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS  
8.1. Modification of Protocol  
Neither an Investigator nor Braintree Laboratories will modify the protocol without first 
obtaining the concurrence of the other and the IRB. Investigators tha t continually violate 
the protocol or commit a serious violation may be subject to termination from the study. 
The study may be halted if at any time an Investigator or Braintree Laboratories deems 
the incidence or severity of adverse events to be unaccept able. 
 
8.2. Subjects Discontinued from the Study  
Subjects may be dropped from the study for any of the following reasons:  
1) Subject took prohibited medications  during the Treatment Period 
2) An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate study 
medication).  
3) The Investigator  decides that the subject should be dropped from the  
       study (e.g. serious adverse event, protocol violation , non-compliance ). 
4) The subject decides to withdraw from the study. Subjects are free to  
       withdraw their consent and discontinue participation in the study at any  
       time. 
 
Braintree Laboratories should be contact[CONTACT_8790] . 
If a subject is discontinued from the study, Braintree Laboratories must b e notified with an 
explanation for all discontinuances.

Version dated  4-13-2016  Page 26 of 35 Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA classification to provide a preferred term 
and primary system organ class for each event.  Proportions of subjects with adverse events 
will be presented for the overall study population, and each demographic su bgroup (age, 
gender and race).  Tables of AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_6657], 
and include overall totals for AEs within each system organ class.  Counting will be done 
by [CONTACT_740470].  A table of counts and percentag es will also be made of those 
subjects with SAEs or AEs which led to withdrawal from the study.  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as adverse events that had an onset day and time on 
or after the day and time of the first dose of study drug until the Day 374 Follow -up Call.  
Adverse Events having missing onset dates will be considered as treatment emergent.  
The difference in adverse event rates between study periods will be tested by [CONTACT_177610] -Square 
or Fisher’s exact test with 95% confidence intervals. 
Laboratory Parameters  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each laboratory parameter at each visit. Laboratory data will 
be summarized for the overall population and  the elderly and non -elderly subgroups.  When 
calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation within a visit window will be 
used if there are multiple observations.  Changes from baseline  (Visit 1) will be presented 
in a similar format.  An ad ditional listing will be provided of those subjects who have 
clinically significant laboratory values.  The data will also be presented as shift tables and 
clinically significant abnormalities will be examined.  
Results of laboratory tests for the change fr om baseline ( Visit 1) and group differences will 
be tested using ANOVA.

Summary statistics (i.e., mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each vital sign at each visit  and compared to the val ues 
obtained at Visit 1.  When calculating the summary statistics only, the last observation 
within a visit window will be used if there are multiple observations.  The data will also be 
presented as shift tables and clinically significant abnormalities wi ll be examined.  
ECG variables will be tabulated and presented for data collected at each visit . Data will be 
tabulated and summarized with descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, CV%, SEM, 
minimum, and maximum) for each of the ECG variables. The differences i n ECG 
variables between Visit 1 ( Baseline), Visit 2 and Visit 6  will be tested using ANOVA.  
 
9.3.3.  Efficacy Analyses ( Patient Reported Outcomes ) 
Subject constipation symptoms and quality of life indicators will be analyzed using data 
from the subject-completed PAC -SYM and PAC -QOL instruments. Change from baseline 
to each visit time point will be presented for each collected measure and will be tested 
using ANOVA. Data for each measure and time point will also be presented categorically 
by [CONTACT_740471] -Square or Fisher’s exact test . 
 
9.4. Study Populations  
The following populations have been defined for data analyses.  
9.4.1.Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
This population includes all enrolled subjects that were dispensed study medicatio n. 
9.4.1.  Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
This population consists of all enrolled subjects that took at least one dose of study 
medication. This population will be utilized for all safety analyses.

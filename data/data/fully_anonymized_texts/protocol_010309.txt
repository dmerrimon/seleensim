3. Abstract  
Chronic poor sleep is prevalent among college students and has wide -ranging negative 
consequences, including poorer academic performance, increased health risk behaviors, and 
greater risk for mental health problems. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_157133], estimates suggest tha t 80-90% of students 
with chronically poor sleep are not receiving help from their college or university. Likewise, college 
student mental health, which shares a bidirectional relationship with sleep quality, has become a 
significant and growing public hea lth concern. Estimates suggest that roughly one third of college 
students meet criteria for a clinically significant mental health problem, and rates of depression, 
anxiety, and suicidality are rising. Digital mental health programs, delivered via mobile a pp, present 
one promising approach to address this need and expand treatment accessibility. In particular, 
mindfulness mobile apps have achieved both mental health and sleep benefits across several 
randomized controlled trials in student populations; howev er, adherence and sustained use after 
interventions have been low. Thus, it is important to address barriers to sustained mindfulness 
practice in order to optimize user outcomes.  
The current study explores using tVNS as a potential method to alleviate barriers to establishing a 
habit of mindfulness practice. In mindfulness interventions it is not uncommon for participants to 
report an initial escalation of anxiety and distress as t hey directly engage with negative thoughts. 
While accepting, decentering, and deriving meaning from these negative reactions is an important 
feature of the psychotherapeutic process in mindfulness interventions, they can also lead to 
disengagement or drop out from the intervention. Similarly, difficulty learning the skill of meditation is 
also common and can contribute to participant dropout. tVNS may exert an anxiolytic effect through 
effects on limbic structures and activation of the parasympathetic nervo us system. Moreover, tVNS 
increases positive affect (i.e. calm) and has been linked to improved interoceptive awareness, which 
are two other potential psychological mediators of mindfulness interventions. Thus, these two 
separate treatment approaches appea r complementary, yet there are no published trials using them 
in combination. The proposed study will enable us to evaluate the utility of this combined 
treatment approach in enhancing college student sleep and mental health, with potentially 
broader impacts for clinical populations.   
4. Background  
Insufficient sleep in the [LOCATION_002] has recently been recognized as a public health epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].1 
College students are at increased risk of experiencing poor sleep due to a “perfect storm” of 
challenging biological, social, and environmental factors, including delayed circadian rhythm, early 
class times, residential sleep environments, high stress lev els, increased social demands, and 
greater substance and electronic use.2–4 Chronic poor sleep is prevalent among college students; 
Version: 3/03/[ADDRESS_182027] identified sleep difficulties as “traumatic or very difficult to handle.”5 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_157134] -known negative consequences of poor sleep,2,6 sleep health 
has not historically been prioritized as an area for intervention on college campuses. For instance, 
according to the 2018 Center for Collegiate Mental Health annual report, approximately 11,000 
students reported sleep disturbances on intake,  yet less than one percent had that concern 
prioritized by [CONTACT_15098].7 Moreover, when sleep questions were included as part of a universal 
behavioral health screening survey, more than 10% of students requested support for their sleep 
concerns.8 Thus, there is a clear unmet need for sleep intervention among college students . 
Importantly, sleep and mental health share a bidirectional relationship, and the prevalence of sleep 
problems on college campuses parallel s the high rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms.9 In 
large national studies , approximately 41% of [LOCATION_002] college students report moderate to 
severe depressive symptoms and 34% report moderate to severe anxiety symptoms.[ADDRESS_182028] college campuses, the increased 
demand for mental health services has unfortunately not been met with a proportional increase in 
counseling center staff and funding . As a result, many counseling centers are under -resourced and 
operate at full capacity with waitlists for much of the year.12 On a nation -wide survey of college 
counseling center directors, 90% raised concerns that students may not be receiving treatment when 
it is most needed.[ADDRESS_182029] in digital mental health interventions, such 
as mindfulness apps, to expand treatment accessibility and impro ve student well -being and sleep 
quality.14–[ADDRESS_182030] the perceived effectiveness of 
mindfulness practice. The current study explores tVNS as one such complementary treatment.  tVNS 
is a safe, non -invasive form of vagus nerve stimulation  (FDA-approved  for the treatment 
resistant depression and epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ). tVNS targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve 
through stimulation at sites of the external ear, such as the inner tragus.[ADDRESS_182031] (NTS).20,[ADDRESS_182032] sleep ,26,27, and longitudinal 
improvements in self -reported sleep quality28–30 in clinical and preclinical studies. tVNS has also 
been associated with improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms.30–[ADDRESS_182033] is to explore the acceptability and efficacy of a combined 
transcutaneous vagus nerve simulation (tVNS) and mindfulness intervention in enhancing sleep and 
well-being among college students and compare it to mindfulness -only and control  condition s with 
the hypothesis that the combined intervention will have greater efficacy due to synergistic brain 
effects of tVNS and mindfulness. In addition to experimental results, the proposed project will 
Version: 3/03/[ADDRESS_182034] size data to inform future trials of the combined approach and assess the feasibility 
and acceptability of our study design.  
Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of sustained  engagement with the 
Brightmind mindfulness app among college students . 
Research question 1.1 : Do students find this app acceptable and engage with it consistently 
across a 4 -week period?   
Research question 1.2: What are the barriers and facilitators to sustained engagement with 
the app? 
Hypothesis 1.3: Participants who spend more time engaging with  the app will see greater 
improvements in mental health (e.g., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, positive affect) 
and HRV compared to participants who spend less time engaging with  the app.  
Specific Aim 2: To obtain preliminary effect size  data on the efficacy of the Brightmind mindfulness 
app in improving  proximal and distal mental health outcomes among college students   
Hypothesis 2.1: Participants in the mindfulness -only group will demonstrate greater 
improvements in mental health ( e.g., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, positive affect ) 
than participants in the control group  
Hypothesis 2.2: Overnight heart rate variability ( HRV ), positive affect, and interoceptive 
awareness will be greater  in the mindfulness -only group compared to  the control  group . 
Hypothesis 2.3: HRV will increase from before to after each mindfulness session.  
 
Specific Aim 3: Determine feasibility and acceptability of the combined tVNS + min dfulness 
intervention.  
Research question 3.1 : Do students find this combined intervention acceptable and 
demonstrate adequate adherence (i.e. use tVNS or sham + mindfulness for at least 10 
minutes/day at least 4 days/week for 2 weeks)?   
Research question 3.2: What are the barriers and facilitators to adherence with the combined 
intervention ? 
Hypothesis 3.3: The combined intervention will be well -tolerated and receive positive 
acceptability ratings.  
Specific Aim 4: Develop effect size data on the efficacy of the combined tVNS + min dfulness 
intervention in improving sleep and mental health among college students.  
Hypothesis 4.1: Participants in the tVNS + min dfulness group will demonstrate greater 
improvements in sleep quality and quantity than participants in the sham + min dfulness 
group  or control groups .  
Hypothesis 4.2:  Participants in the tVNS + min dfulness group will demonstrate greater 
improvements in  mood and mood related factors  ( e.g., stress, anxiety, depressive 
symptoms, positive affect ) than participants in the sham + min dfulness group  or control 
group s.

6.2 Experimental design . As participants are scheduled for intake visits, they will be assigned to 
either a tVNS group (tVNS + mindfulness or sham + mindfulness) or a non -tVNS group (mindfulness 
only or control) by [CONTACT_157150] (i.e. tVNS device 
availability) to expedite study completion. Within each of these groups, participants will be 
randomized via alternating order to either the active or control condition (in other words, once a 
participant is assigned to a tVNS group, they will t hen be randomized to either the tVNS + 
mindfulness or sham + mindfulness group).  This process will repeat until each group has the target 
number of participants.  
In the initial visit, a research assistant will review the appropriate informed consent for m. During this 
process, participants assigned to a stimulation group (tVNS + mindfulness  or sham + mindfulness ) 
will be told  that they  have been  randomized to receive one of two different types of noninvasive 
vagal nerve stimulation , that we think one of the conditions may be mo re effective, and that they 
have a 50/50  chance of being in that group. For participants randomized to the non-stimulation 
groups  (mindfulness only or control) , they will be told that they have been randomly assigned to use 
one of two mobile app interventions, that we think one of the interventions may be more effective, 
and that they have a 50/50 chance of being in that gro up. After providing written informed consent, 
participants will complete a brief health questionnaire as part of our inclusion/exclusion screening 
(see section 6.5). If participants screen out after signing the informed consent, the session will end , 
and any data collected will be kept in a locked filing cabinet . 
After passing the screening, participants will complete an online survey that will include measures of 
mood, well -being, pain, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and sleep quality (see section 6.6 for specific 
measures).  
These measures are self -report and will establish a baseline for each participant. They will be 
provided with and trained on the following equipment depending on their group assignment:  
- Brightmind Meditation mobile mindfulness app  (Brightmind Meditation, LLC; 
https://www.brightmind.com ): Participants in each of the three active treatment groups (tVNS 
+ mindfulness, sham + mindfulness, and mindfulness -only) will be provided with free access 
to the Brightmind  mobile mindfulness app. During the intake session, they will download the 
app and complete an orientation to learn its features. They will be asked to practice 
mindfulness meditation through  the app for 10 minutes each evening  during the 4 -week Intake -

days/week.  
- Control task : Participants in the control group will be provided with the link and instructions 
for a control task (an online number puzzle: https://play2048.co/ ) that has been used in 
previous studies of mindfulness apps.33 They will be asked to engage with this control task 
for 10 minutes each evening  during the 4 -week intervention phase, with compliance defined 
as engaging with the task 10 minutes/day for at least 4 days/week. Participants in the control 
group will receive free access to the Brightmind mindfulness app after study completion.  
- Soterix Medical RELIfit -Tragus  Device  (Soterix Medical Inc.; 
https://soterixmedical.com/research/tavns ): Participants in the tVNS + mindfulness and sham 
+ mindfulness groups will be pro vided with the Soterix Medical RELIfit -Tragus device, as well 
as its accompanying equipment (e.g., device charger, gel, cleaning materials). During the 
intake session, they will be trained on procedures for using the device, including gel 
application, electrode placement, and device configuration. Once the research assistant 
confirms that the participant understands how to apply the electrodes and set the stimulator, 
the research assistant will demonstrate how to take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_157135]. Participants  will be instructed to take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_157136]. Participants  will be asked  to administer tVNS concurrently 
with mindfulness practice for at least [ADDRESS_182036] band  (Fitbit LLC ): All participants will be provided with a Fitbit wrist band for 
overnight sleep and HRV measurement. They  will be instructed  on the best method for 
wearing the band during the initial visit. Participants will be asked to wear the wristband 
overnight each night for the [ADDRESS_182037] 4 nights/week.  
- Polar H10 Chest Strap (Polar Electro ; https://www.polar.com/us -
en/products/accessories/h10_heart_rate_sensor ): All participants will be provided with a 
Polar H10 chest strap for HRV measurement during mindfulness practice. They  will be 
instructed  on the best method for wearing the chest strap  during the initial visit . In addition, 
the research assistant will assist them in downloading a mobile app  for data 
collection/storage  and pairing it with the Polar H10 band for HRV recording. They will be 
asked to wear the chest strap during at least one mindfulness practice session per week 
during the 4 -week intervention p eriod.  
After receiving study equipment and completing training procedures, participants will begin the 
intervention phase at home. They will be provided with written and/or video instructions as a 
reminder of procedures for the intervention phase depending on the ir group  (summarized in Table 
1). Study staff will also be available to answer questions or provide reminders via email and/or 
phone. During the intervention phase, participants will complete brief weekly online surveys  
consisting of  some of the measures administered at baseline (see section 6.6). The survey will be 
sent via an electronic link to participants’ email address or phone number. At the completion of the 4 -
week intervention phase , the research assistant will coordinate with the participant to schedule a 
time to return study equipment and distribute participant payment. Participants will be compensated 
for their time and effort (see section 10).

history), medical conditions associated with neurological effects (e.g. heart, kidney disease ), 
autoimmune disorders, and severe psychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia) will be excluded. 
Participants with any history of brain surgery, tumor, intracranial metal implantation, pacemakers or 
other implanted devices will be excluded. These elements will be assessed via self -report.  
 
Sleep medications and/or psychotropic medications  are exclusionary . Current illicit or prescription 
drug abuse (within the last two months) will result in exclusion or delay. Marijuana or alcohol 
abuse >[ADDRESS_182044] information.  
 
Behavioral.  The following tests may be included in  the online surveys : 
  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_33548] (PSQI):34 This 19 -item scale yields component scores for seven 
different domains of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, 
habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime 
dysfunction.  We will use this measure to assess for changes in self -reported sleep quality 
across the study period. This measure may be administered at intake, week 2, week 4, and 
follow -up.  
 
Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS) :35 This 8 -item questionnaire assesses daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_157137].  We will use this measure to assess for changes in self -reported daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_157138].  This measure may be administered at intake, week 2, week 4, and 
follow -up. 
 
Patient Health Questionnaire -8 (PHQ -8):[ADDRESS_182045] week. This measure may be administered at 
intake, week 2, week 4, and follow -up.   
 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder -7 (GAD -7):[ADDRESS_182046] week. This measure may be administered at intake, week 2, week 4, and follow -up.   
 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS):38 This 10 -item questionnaire measures the degree to which 
situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful. In particular, it gauges how unpredictable, 
uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. We will adjust the time scale to 
asking about symptoms over the past week and use this measure to track potential changes 
in stress levels.  This measure may be administered at intake, weekly, and at follow -up. 
 
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ):39 Positive emotions  (overall, serenity, 
joviality, self -assurance) and negative emotions  (overall, sadness, fear, hostility) will be 
Version: 3/03/2022               Page 9 of 18 measured with 17 adjectives each.  This measure will be used to assess changes in self -
reported emotions . This measure may be administered at intake, weekly, and at follow -up. 
 
Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness -2 (MAIA -2):40 Interoceptive 
awareness  will be assessed as a potential proximal outcome  of mindfulness practice . We will 
use the  body listening  (3 items) , trusting  (3 items) , and self -regulation (4 items) subscales  (10 
items total ). These subscales may be administered at intake, weekly, and at follow -up. 
Applied Mindfulness Process Scale (AMPS) :41 The AMPS scale measures mindful emotion 
regulation – decentering, positive emotion regulation, and negative emotion regulation . This 
measure will be used to assess for changes in mindful emotion regulation associated with 
longitudinal use of the mindfulness app. The 15 -item scale may be administered at intake, 
week 2, week 4, and follow -up. 
The Nondual Awareness Dimensional Assessment  - State (NADA -S).42This 3 -item scale 
measures mindfulness -related processes of self -transcendence. We use it to assess 
changes in self -transcendence associated with the use of the mindfulness app. The scale is 
administered at intake, weekly, and at follow -up. 
PERMA Profiler :43 This questionnaire measures flourishing across 5 domains: positive 
emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment following [CONTACT_157163]’s 
well-being theory. We will use this 19-item measure to assess for changes in self -reported 
well-being. This measure may be administered at intake, week 4, and at follow -up. 
 
Pain Numeric Rating Scale : Participants will be asked to rate their current pain level on a scale 
from 0-10 (0 = no pain at all , 10 = highest level of pain imaginable) , as tVNS and mindfulness 
may provide pain relief. This measure may be administered at intake, weekly, and at follow -
up. 
 
System Usability Survey (SUS):[ADDRESS_182047] version of a usability scale. Participan ts 
will be given 10 statements regarding the usability of the equipment they used, and they will 
report how much they agree with each statement on a 1 – 5 scale.  This measure will only be 
given after the completion of the intervention phase (week 4).  
 
Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) , Intervention  Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and 
Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM):45 These brief 4 -item scales measures the degree to 
which participants believe an intervention is acceptable, appropriate, and feasible.  These 
measures will only be given after the completion of the intervention phase (week 4).  
 
Physiological. Subjects will be given a  Fitbit  brand wristband  that offers real -time phys iological data 
acquisition to use to monitor their sleep quantity , quality , and overnight heart rate variability (HRV) 
during the intervention phase.  Participants will also be given a Polar H10 chest strap to use during 
mindfulness sessions, measuring their momentary HRV.  Participants  may be provided a preassigned  
account and password for the se wearable devices, which may be accessed by [CONTACT_157152] d ata.  
 
Analysis Plan .  
- To analyze feasibility data, we will qualitatively examine rates of recruitment and drop 
out/attrition and compare them to prior research. Quantitatively, to examine whether dropout 
is selective, participants who completed the study will be compared to par ticipants who 
dropped out on group via chi -square independence test. To analyze acceptability data, 
outcomes regarding tolerance and acceptability will be compared between the groups via 
Version: 3/03/2022               Page 10 of 18 ANOVA. In addition, we will perform thematic analysis of participant responses to open -ended 
questions about feasibility and acceptability.  
- To examine trajectory of sleep and mental health/well -being over time, multilevel modeling 
(MLM) analyses will be conducted using unrestricted full information maximum likelihood in R 
via the “lme4” package. Separate models will be conducted using each sle ep and mental 
health/well -being outcome measure as a dependent variable. Linear and quadratic time trends 
will be estimated, and intervention group will be included as a moderator. To examine 
adherence, the number of minutes participants spend engaged with  the app or tVNS device 
per week will be averaged. Then, an MLM will be conducted using average weekly 
engagement as the dependent variable and time (linear and quadratic) and group as 
predictors. Retention rates between intervention groups will be compare d using an 
independent samples t -test. 
 
Nerve Stimulation. The auricular branch of the vagus nerve projects to the brainstem and is 
accessible via electrical stimulation through surface electrodes. Stimulation produces vagus sensory 
evoked potentials not induced with off -target stimulation.20,21 
Earpi[INVESTIGATOR_157139]: All subjects will be instructed to place the Soterix device earpi[INVESTIGATOR_157140] -target stimulation per 
local pi[INVESTIGATOR_47002]  (see Figure 2) . Subjects will demonstrate their ability to set up the 
stimulator —including earpi[INVESTIGATOR_51428] —and text the pi[INVESTIGATOR_157141], similar to Figure [ADDRESS_182048] properly placed 
their electrodes. Participants will be asked to send a photo of their electrode placement for 
each stimulation session  via SMS.  
Stimulation  Device : We will use  the Soterix Medical RELIfit -Tragus transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation devices . For details, see “Device type” in my.irb. Stimulus pulses will be 
alternating in polarity to reduce tissue irritation and will be delivered at 20Hz, 200 μs pulse 
width, within the range of published stimulus parameters .46–48  
Calibration:  Participants will undergo calibration during the intake -training visit. Prior to 
calibration, participants will be  informed that the stimul ation  intensity will be slowly increased 
until they report any discomfort and th en reduced to a comfortable level for the remainder of 
the study . Individual sensitivity to tVNS stimulation w ill then be  evaluated with a structured 
stepped -ramp protocol, with a brief pause at each step during which the participant w ill be  
asked what the stimulus felt like to them and if they experienced any discomfort. The 
stimulation intensity w ill then set to 80% of the discomfort threshold for the active tVNS group 
and near to 0% (just enough to keep device on)  of the discomfort threshold for the sham 
stimulation group. If the participant reports irritation with stimulation during this ramp up 
procedure (which can last ~15 minutes), electrode adhesion will be checked (if there is poor 
contact, it can affect the sensation) and stimulation intensity will be reduced if necessary (any 
change will be documented) . If the participant  further indicates discomfort , stimulation will be 
discontinued. If the patient evidence dizziness /lightheadedness  or if a comfortable level of 
stimulation is not achievable at calibration,  the participant will be removed from the study  (this 
will be documented) .  
Blinding: Participants will be blinded to condition and told that, after calibration, the stimulus 
intensity will be set to below the calibration ( discomfort  threshold) level and that they may not 
feel the stimulation once reduced. We have used this form of psychological sham approach in 
Version: 3/03/[ADDRESS_182049] be entered into the tVNS device in order for 
stimulation to be administered. They are one -time use only, meaning that participants will not 
be able to administer tVNS more frequently than instructed in the study protocol. Moreove r, 
participants will be told that these blinding codes correspond to stimulation 
parameters/intensity that is calibrated to them only, and that they are not safe to be used on 
other people (e.g., friends, roommates). The pi[INVESTIGATOR_157142] a further control against participants allowing 
others to use the stimulation device. The blinding codes will also specify stimulation length, 
with a maximum of one hour (after which, stimulatio n will be turned off). Of note, stimulation 
also turns off if there is not good connectivity between the earpi[INVESTIGATOR_157143] (e.g., if the 
earpi[INVESTIGATOR_157144]).  
At-Home Device Use: Per the Soterix website: “ The Soterix Medical taVNS device is intended 
for use by, or under the direct or remote supervision of , a trained healthcare practitioner.” We 
have  discussed this statement via email  with Abhishek Datta, CEO and CTO  of Soterix  
Medical , who clarified that “By [CONTACT_157153] - we simply mean someone who 
is aware of taVNS, technology, risks, etc. and knows how to administer the technique”, and 
“By [CONTACT_157154] - the system can be self -administe red. The subject or caregiver (proxy 
in some cases) would need to be trained on placing the electrodes before they become eligible.  
The system is designed such that the administrator (PI, clinical center personnel,etc) sets the 
desired dose (duration, frequency , pulse width, etc) before handing it off to the subject. The 
subject can only deliver stimulation as prescribed by [CONTACT_3652]  [or lab]  (i.e. cannot misuse). So 
basically a researcher can remotely supervise administration.”  This email correspondence is 
attached as supplementary material.  Given this clarification, our study protocol (e.g., with staff 
training participants on electrode placement/device use and subsequent at -home self -
administration with “remote supervision”) is consistent with Soterix Medical’s intended use of 
the device . We will be receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_157145].

per communication with the FDA and rules governing assessment of risk if the study is a non -
significant risk (NSR) investigation.

Participants in our 
study will be instructed to start with the “Stress Less” introductory  course of 8 sessions. Every session 
includes a brief explanation of how the practice helps reduce stress.  
- Session 1, Get Grounded – focus on hearing sound or silence, physical body sensations, focus 
on what you see, acknowledge emotional state, let stressful thoughts and feelings come and 
go in the background with relaxed body and slight smile  
- Session 2, Relaxation – enjoy rest and relaxation, notice what relaxation feels like by [CONTACT_157156], then whole body  
- Session 3, Training Positivity – come up with word or phrase  that helps overcome stress, 
mentally repeat ; find a positive, relaxing mental image, hold it; create positive emotional 
sensation in body that relates to positive phrase and image  
- Session 4, Untangle and Be Free – notice mental images or blank screen, notice mental talk 
or silence, notice emotional sensations in body or rest – develop flexibility , observer mindset  
- Session 5, Soothing Sound – noting technique – acknowledging and focusing on sensory 
experience - sounds or silence, every few seconds  
- Session 6, Focused Relaxation – noting relaxation in body  every few seconds , tightening &

7. Possible Discomforts and Risk  
7.1 Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulator.  Previous studies using some form of stimulation found 
that some side effects may occur including itching, redness, discomfort, and tingling/mild  pain at the 
stimulation site. These side effects usually end shortly after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_157147]. If the electrodes are 
not well placed then participants might experience mild pain, although the researchers will adjust the 
electrode placement if this happe ns. Researchers will also explain how to adjust electrodes for when 
the subjects are at home.  Other less common potential side effects (observed in <1% of study 
populations) include nausea, headache, heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness, vocal hoarseness, and 
nasopharyingitis.46,47 It is important to note that these less common side effects were primarily found 
in studies of clinical  populations with a variety of stimulation methods (e.g., cervical stimulation, 
bilateral stimulation, longer lengths of stimulation) that are not being used in this study . Thus, while 
these side effects have been observed in some prior studies, we do not anticipate that are likely to 
occur in this study of healthy college students.   
We will be using a Soterix Medical taVNS device. Their website describes the device safety thusly:  
 
“taVNS on the other hand, delivers electrical stimulation to the auricular branch of the 
vagus nerve (ABVN), an easily accessible target that innervates the human ear (Peukar 
Version: 3/03/2022               Page 13 of 18 and Filler 2002). Over the last decade, several groups have demonstrated the safety and 
tolerability of this method, including central and peripheral nervous system effects, and 
behavioral effects in neuropsychiatric populations (Kreuzer et al 2012, Clancy  et al 2014, 
Rong et al 2016, Bauer et al 2016 ). taVNS is also being explored in individuals to 
enhance cognitive and social functioning (Jacobs et al 2015,Jongkees et al 
2018,Colzato et al 2018). Furthermore, side -effects of taVNS are minimal, with skin 
irritation or redness being the most common side -effect.  In a review of [ADDRESS_182051] was local skin 
irritation (%18). Authors conclude tVNS is well tolerated and safe (Redgrave et al., 
2018).””

Note, the devices used in these studies are diverse (all TENS unit variants). Soterix’s device is 
based on their commonly used TENS unit platform used in neuromodulation studies around the 
world (e.g., TDCS).  
7.2 Mindfulness Practice : Mindfulness practice can reveal or bring into greater focus uncomfortable 
thoughts , emotions , or bodily sensations . These experiences are similar to those that a person might 
experience in everyday life  or while using other commercially available mindfulness apps . The 
Brightmind Meditation app is structured to begin with positive and relaxing experiences to minimize 
user discomfort or frustration as they develop mindfulness skills.  
7.3 Mood Assessments: Questions about mood and personality can sometimes be uncomfortable 
(e.g., talking about things that make you  sad or anxious). If participants  experience distress  while 
completing these questionnaires , they will be instructed  to contact a research assistant who will be 
able to provide community mental health resources.  
Version: 3/03/2022               Page 14 of 18 7.4 Wearable Sensors: The wrist monitor is comparable to wearing a standard wristwatch. If the  band 
is too tight, there is a risk of skin irritation. Similar risks apply to the chest band. Both bands are 
adjustable to ensure participant comfort.

to this database. All staff are or will be fully trained in relevant ethical principles and procedures, 
including confidentiality.  
Once a participant completes the entirety of the study (i.e. returns the equipment and/or receives 
payment) and the payment is updated according to UF’s Human Participant Payments guidelines, the 
subject’s contact [CONTACT_157159]/social -security -number will be redacted form 
the questionnaires and payment receipts.  
7.6 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  The investigative team will meet regularly to discuss data and 
safety monitoring issues. Any issues identified during the course of these meetings will be handled in 
a manner consistent with the University of [LOCATION_012]’s policies.  
 
8. Possible Benefits  
A potential benefit of participating in th is study is  experiencing a short -term improvement in mood and 
sleep quality . No direct long-term benefits can be reasonably expected from this study , except if the 
mindfulness training app intervention shows preliminary efficacy and participants continue using it on 
their own after the study is over . The information garnered from this study may provide valuable data 
on the optimization of the tVNS  technology , which  has the potential to be a cheap, effective, and safe 
tool for augmenti ng effects of mindfulness practice . 
 
9. Conflict of Interest  
There are no known conflicts of interest.  
 
10.  Participant Payment  
 
Participants will be compensated for their time and effort  participating in the study. The amount is 
specified on my.irb.ufl.edu and the consent form.

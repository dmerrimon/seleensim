An mHealth Intervention for HIV-Positive Young MSM to 
Optimize HIV Medication Adherence and Care Outcomes
Study Design This study is a two arm Sequential Multiple-Assignment 
Randomization Trial (SMART) that will test the feasibility 
and acceptability of the intervention and trial design in a 6-
month pi[INVESTIGATOR_836930] (YMSM) and young transgender women who 
have sex with men (YTWSM) living with HIV, ages 15-29. 
Participants will be randomized to one of three treatment 
strategies: (TS1) AQ alone followed by [CONTACT_836951]+NSC for Non-
Responders; (TS2) AQ+NSC followed by [CONTACT_836952]+NSC for Responders and Continued AQ+NSC for Non-
Responders; and (TS3) AQ+NSC followed by [CONTACT_264368]-escalation 
to AQ for Responders and Continued AQ+NSC for Non-
Responders. Responder status will be assessed at 3 months, 
based on app reported adherence and available viral load 
(VL) data. 
Primary Objective To test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy 
of the AQ/AQ+ intervention app among 75 YMSM and 
YTWSM, ages 15-29, by [CONTACT_14664] a SMART with 
assessments at baseline (month 0), month 3 (intervention arm 
reassignment) and month 6 (end of intervention). The 
primary outcome measures are: (a) Intervention feasibility: 
Average proportion of days of any app use, average 
proportion of days of HIV medication tracked and (b) 
Intervention acceptability: Mean intervention acceptability, 
composite score AHAA.
To analyze app paradata to determine which treatment 
strategies embedded in the SMART (escalation, de-
escalation, and maintenance combinations) are most 
promising to test for sustained app engagement, self-reported 
adherence, and VS. 
Secondary 
Objective(s)The secondary outcome measures (preliminary efficacy) are: 
(c) Change in ART medication adherence from Baseline to 
Month 6 (self-report); (d) Difference in ART medication 
adherence between treatment arms at month 6; and (e) Rate 
of viral suppression (VS) at 6-month follow-up

The secondary objective is to assess the preliminary efficacy of the 
AQ/AQ+ intervention at improving self-reported ART adherence 
and viral suppression.  
Exploratory research question: Exploratory analyses will assess 
whether app engagement and adherence vary by [CONTACT_836953] (e.g. education level, depression, substance use). 
Qualitative research questions: We will thematically code and 
analyze in-app text data (iNSC session transcripts, daily discussion 
forum posts) and qualitative exit-interview data to assess app 
engagement and the acceptability and feasibility of the app features.
2.2 H1: The intervention design will be feasible as defined by [CONTACT_836954] 30% of trial days or more. 
H2: The intervention will be acceptable as defined by [CONTACT_836955].
H2a: Greater app use will be positively associated with 
higher AHAA scores. 
H3: Average self-reported ART medication adherence will show 
trends toward improvement from Baseline to Month 6 across 
intervention arms.
H3a: Greater app use will be positively associated with 
improvement in ART medication adherence.
H4: The proportion of virally suppressed participants will increase 
from baseline to 6-month follow-up 
H4a: Greater app use will be positively associated with 
achieving viral suppression.

Page 7 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022Network (ATN) only 7% of a predominantly Black YMSM sample 
of HIV-positive youth achieved VS. In another ATN study, only 
59% of VS youth attending clinics with comprehensive supportive 
services maintained 12-month VS. As most YMSM with detectable 
viral load (VL) report condomless anal sex, onward transmission is 
likely to continue. Effective interventions for YMSM are needed to 
support sustained VS for individual health and HIV prevention. 
Sustained antiretroviral (ART) adherence is critical for VS but 
suboptimal among YMSM. A 2014 meta-analysis of adherence for 
youth living with HIV found overall low self-reported adherence of 
62.3%. Barriers to adherence and VS among youth and YMSM 
include forgetting or not feeling like taking ART, low adherence 
self-efficacy, psychological distress (depression, anxiety), substance 
use, structural barriers (transportation, homelessness, insurance), low 
social support, and HIV-related stigma. Many YMSM experience 
multiple barriers, impacting adherence and VS in a dose-response 
nature. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_836933], few adherence interventions have focused on 
YMSM. A 2017 systematic review of interventions along the HIV 
care continuum identified 117 medication adherence interventions; 
only 9 (8%) focused on adolescents/youth and only 2 (2%) focused 
on MSM. A [ADDRESS_1161876] 
or under development, none appear to utilize smartphone technology 
and engagement features in the innovative ways we propose. 
The flexibility of mobile health (mHealth) platforms and the power 
of paradata allow real-time assessment of user engagement and 
adaptive delivery of tailored content to fit individual HIV 
management challenges. Daily mobile phone-based contact [CONTACT_836956]. High smartphone ownership among diverse YMSM 
provides capacity for national scale up and diffusion. With extensive 
input from HIV-positive YMSM, we developed the AllyQuest (AQ) 
smartphone app as a tailored adherence and social support 
intervention. In a 4-week pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], AQ was rated highly and 
greater app use was associated with significant increases in HIV 
knowledge and self-management. 
3.2 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_593785], some participants minimally 
engaged with the app and daily app use declined over the course of 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (from 4.3 to 2.8 days/week). Based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690], we 
propose to enhance AQ engagement and effectiveness by [CONTACT_836957], small financial incentives, and personalized text-
based adherence counseling. AQ can be programmed to deliver 
individualized, tailored content through complex algorithms, but a

Page 8 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022combination approach (auto-tailoring plus two-way texting) may 
benefit some YMSM via higher intervention engagement and 
adherence support. Our ART counseling model is based on Next 
Step Counseling (iNSC), a brief, client-centered motivational 
approach to supporting medication adherence. iNSC was developed 
for the iPrEx pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trial and was found to 
be highly acceptable among MSM. iNSC, which is grounded in the 
Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB) model of ART 
adherence, provides flexible, individualized adherence support. Core 
components of iNSC include: reviewing participant experiences with 
adherence, exploring adherence facilitators and barriers, identifying 
adherence needs and strategies, and developi[INVESTIGATOR_836934]. Our study team is already adapting iNSC for two-way text chat 
in a PrEP adherence app for YMSM (U19-HD089881). 
Sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) have 
numerous advantages over traditional trial designs. In these adaptive 
interventions, the type or dose of the intervention (app alone vs. app 
+ iNSC) is adjusted based on participant characteristics or response 
(adherence/VS). Thus, an adaptive intervention is a sequence of 
decision rules that specify how the intensity or type of treatment 
should change depending on the patient's needs rather than applying 
a “one size fits all” approach. SMARTs are an efficient and rigorous 
way to maximize clinical utility and real-world applicability. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_836935] a design that more closely mirrors clinical 
practice.
This study has been previously reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_836958]. All study 
activities outlined in this protocol, including recruitment, 
enrollment, data collection, and follow-up with participants were 
completed while the research team was at UNC-CH. By 
[CONTACT_836959], we are 
seeking IRB approval for purposes of data analysis only. The 
original protocol, study documents, and approval letters are 
appended in the IRB submission.
3.3 Improving ART adherence among YMSM is an urgent public health 
issue. Given estimates that only 7 to 38% of youth/young adults 
living with HIV achieve VS, advancing innovative ART adherence 
interventions for YMSM with HIV is a pressing priority. This 
proposal expands on our existing theory-based app, AQ, which 
showed promise for engagement and impact on HIV knowledge and 
HIV self-management, while adding innovative features via 
enhanced app engagement strategies and SMART adaptive design. 
Using a SMART design will allow us to evaluate the impact of 
multiple evidence-based intervention treatment strategies. mHealth

real-time via app paradata (usage metrics) and adapt strategies when 
a participant is not responding to an initial intervention approach. 
Adaptive strategies that adjust for intervention non-response and 
increase in intensity to meet the needs of non-responders represent a 
more “real-world” approach, which would have a high public health 
impact and great potential for rapid scale-up and dissemination. 
Simultaneously evaluating the efficacy of a treatment strategy that 
de-escalates intervention intensity among responsive participants 
more closely mirrors clinical practice, follows the scientific rationale 
that some patients will benefit from a more intensive intervention 
up-front, and optimally applies resources where and when they are 
most needed. 
4.0 Study Endpoints
4.1 The primary study endpoint of 1) feasibility is app use, measured by 
[CONTACT_836960]/AQ+; 2) acceptability is average 
composite score on the AHAA.
The secondary study endpoint of preliminary efficacy of the 
AQ/AQ+ intervention is average 6-month self-reported ART 
medication adherence and end-of-study proportion of viral 
suppression.

requirements specified in Section 201(h) of the FD&C Act (21 USC 
321(h)). However, to provide context, we have included an overview of the 
intervention and its intended use in the study below: 
AQ is a theory-informed, multi-feature medication adherence and social 
support app. AQ+ adds a component of one-on-one guided support provided 
through the app by [CONTACT_836961]. The intervention app is currently 
designed to provide six months of educational content and adherence 
coaching. In the current trial, the app will be tested using an adaptive trial 
design which will allow participants to move between the two intervention 
conditions (AQ vs. AQ+) to best meet their current medication adherence 
and health needs. 
AQ development was guided by [CONTACT_836962] (SCT), narrative communication (e.g. storytelling), 
and the principles of persuasive technology. AQ addresses key principles of 
SCT including: (1) observational learning by [CONTACT_836963]; (2) 
modeling and vicarious experiences (observing and participating in Daily 
Discussions, exploration of narrative “choose-your-own-adventure” stories); 
(3) self-efficacy and verbal persuasion from expert sources (multi-media 
knowledge center, tailored messages) and (4) reinforcements (virtual

persuasive technology informed the development of our technology partner 
Ayogo’s Empower™ platform employed for AQ. According to the FBM, 
the principal factors to promote behavior change using technology include 
triggers, ability, and motivation. In AQ app notifications are triggers for 
healthy behaviors while app content also helps participants identify their 
own daily triggers. Regular self-reported adherence prompts act as 
additional triggers. Ability is increased through knowledge and by [CONTACT_836964] (e.g. copi[INVESTIGATOR_254017], knowing how to 
fill a prescription). Participants get tips from others dealing with similar 
issues and through narrative stories that reinforce the consequences of health 
behavior choices. App motivators include social support, rewards, goal 
setting, and achievement. Table 1 presents all features of the app along with 
their purpose and evidence base.

Integrated Next Step Counseling (iNSC) is an interactive, client-
centered motivational intervention that was developed and 
implemented during the iPrEx PrEP trial and was found to be highly 
acceptable among MSM. The intervention is based on the IMB 
model and provides flexible, individualized counseling with the goal 
of supporting adherence and the accurate reporting of adherence. 
The key components of iNSC counseling include: review of 
participant experiences with adherence, exploration of adherence 
facilitators and barriers, identification of adherence needs, 
identification of strategies to meet needs, and development of an 
adherence action plan. Our team has adapted iNSC for use as a two-
way text-based intervention to support ART within the context of the 
AQ app. Those assigned to AQ+ for 3 months will receive 7 iNSC 
sessions; those who do not de-escalate at month 3 and are thus 
assigned to AQ+ for all 6 months will receive 15 iNSC sessions. 
Depending on when escalation occurs (due to VL testing window), 
time between chats may vary but will not exceed [ADDRESS_1161879] brief 
text messaging “check ins” with YMSM in between sessions using 
AQ’s provider dashboard. Text check ins are an evidence-based 
method to keep participants engaged and can provide reminders of 
personal goals set during sessions. During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_253225], staff 
will document all iNSC sessions and the study team will regularly 
review session transcripts for protocol fidelity.

adherence in the app and/or viral load status. As presented in Table 3 
below, at 3 months, among those initially assigned to AQ, non-
responders were escalated to AQ+ and responders remained on 
AQ; among those initially assigned to AQ+, non-responders 
remained on AQ+ and received refocused iNSC support, while 
responders either remained on AQ+ or de-escalated to AQ 
depending  on the treatment strategy  they were randomized to at 
baseline . The primary outcome measure is the feasibility of the 
SMART and the acceptability of the AllyQuest app. Secondary 
outcomes include self-reported ART adherence and viral 
suppression. As a secondary analysis, we will compare  
escalation/de-escalation decisions based on in-app reported ART 
adherence to month 3 viral  loads . We also pi[INVESTIGATOR_836939]. Qualitative exit interviews were

6.2 We conducted a 6-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_836940] 71 
HIV-positive YMSM/YTW on ART with detectable viral load (VL) 
or poor adherence. Participants were randomized to one of three 
treatment strategies (TS): (TS1) AQ alone followed by [CONTACT_836972]+NSC for Non-
Responders; (TS2) AQ+NSC followed by [CONTACT_836973]+NSC for 
Responders and Continued AQ+NSC for Non-Responders; and 
(TS3) AQ+NSC followed by [CONTACT_264368]-escalation to AQ for Responders 
and Continued AQ+NSC for Non-Responders. Daily app-reported 
adherence and 3-month VL were used as decision rules to escalate, 
de-escalate, or maintain intervention intensity. Participants 
completed surveys and VL tests at baseline, 3- and 6- months. We 
will measure the trial procedures’ feasibility and acceptability via 
surveys, in-depth exit interviews, and study records (e.g. attrition, 
staffing needs, and completeness of VL data). We will utilize 3 types 
of paradata to assess intervention feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy: 1) frequency and total time spent on each AQ 
feature; 2) in-app daily adherence reports; and 3) user-contributed 
content (adherence counseling chat logs, user-entered daily 
discussion content and adherence strategies). We will use paradata 
sources 1 and 2 to determine which treatment strategies embedded in 
the SMART (escalation, de-escalation, and maintenance 
combinations) result in sustained app engagement, self-reported 
adherence, and VS. Exploratory analyses will assess whether app 
engagement and adherence vary by [CONTACT_836974] (e.g.

thematically code and analyze paradata source [ADDRESS_1161886] text-based adherence 
counseling. 
Feasibility and Acceptability analyses
To determine the SMART procedures’ feasibility we will adapt 
Thabane et al.’s framework for assessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_836941] 4 
domains: study Processes (e.g. recruitment rates, escalation 
procedures); Resources (e.g. retention, appropriateness of eligibility 
criteria); Management (e.g. staff capacity, time to deliver NSC); and 
Science (e.g. completeness of VL data, frequency of app use; 
estimated intervention effect, variance of intervention effect). To 
measure the SMART procedures’ acceptability we will use a 
combination of survey measures Acceptability of Health Apps 
among Adolescents (e.g. AHAA), open-ended interview questions, 
and paradata metrics (Table 5). CASI surveys will also measure 
moderators (Table 5) associated with adherence to assess feasibility 
of using these as tailoring variables in a future fully-powered 
SMART. 
Paradata overview: AQ’s Empower™ platform captures 
timestamped usage metrics (paradata) that can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_836942]. We will utilize three 
types of paradata to assess intervention feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy: 
Source 1: frequency and total time spent on each AQ 
feature; 
Source 2: in-app self-reported daily adherence; and 
Source 3: user-contributed content (adherence counseling 
chat logs, user-entered in-app content, including social wall 
posts and adherence strategies). 
We will assess AQ intervention feasibility by [CONTACT_836975] [ADDRESS_1161887] text-based adherence 
counseling via AQ+. We will code whether adherence strategies are 
identified within the chat sessions and then implemented within the 
user’s in-app reported adherence strategies, and whether a user’s in-
app daily adherence reports (paradata source 2) increase after an 
NSC session. We will use paradata metrics as a proxy measure of 
AQ intervention acceptability by [CONTACT_836976] (paradata source 1). We will supplement paradata with 
participant-reported intervention acceptability using an app 
acceptability questionnaire (BL, 3M, 6M) and the Acceptability of

10.3 Special populations: 
This study does not include adults who are unable to consent
This study DOES include teenagers who are 15 years or older
This study does not include pregnant women
NIH has concluded that this protocol does NOT meet Federal 
requirements governing prisoner participation in human subjects 
research and should NOT be considered by [CONTACT_146367]. Subjects enrolled who subsequently 
become incarcerated or are placed in detention may not continue 
study participation. Study visits cannot be conducted during the 
period of incarceration or detention
For all participants, study staff reviews the informed consent/assent 
to make an assessment of the youth’s decisional capacity and ability 
to provide consent/assent prior to signing, using a 2-step process. 
First, staff determines if the person understands the study goals by 
[CONTACT_7939] “Can you tell me what this study is about?” In step 2, 
potential participants will be asked questions designed to assess their 
capacity to understand, appreciate, reason with, and express a choice 
about participation in our specific protocol. Participants will be 
asked to: name [CONTACT_112539];

Page 22 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022explain what they would do if they no longer wished to participate in 
the study; explain what they would do if they experienced distress 
during the study; and identify potential risks for participating in the 
study. For youth who cannot answer these questions, the study staff 
will go back and review the relevant elements of consent with the 
participant again and repeat the process. Youth who appear not to 
understand after repeated review will not be enrolled in the study. If 
the enrollment process occurs online, research staff will talk with 
potential participants via phone or online teleconference software 
such as Zoom or other comparable platform to assess for decisional 
capacity and to address any questions or concerns the person may 
have.
As this is a minimal risk study, we sought a waiver of parental 
consent for individuals under age 18. A request for a waiver of the 
requirement for parental permission is requested for 2 reasons:  1) 
many youth would be reluctant to participate in this study – which 
focuses on HIV and risks for poorer medication adherence – if they 
are required to get parental permission; and 2) many of the youth in 
our study are likely to be gay, bisexual, or have an attraction to 
persons of the same gender, but may not be out to their parents; 
requiring parental permission may place participants at risk for 
outing themselves as part of the LGBT community or having HIV. 
For these reasons, we believe it is important to be granted a waiver 
for parental permission for this study population.
11.0 Vulnerable Populations
11.1 Waiver of parental consent:  Participants under 18 years of age were 
enrolled with a waiver of parental consent granted by [CONTACT_11604]-CH IRB 
as the central IRB (IRB of Record at the time of enrollment) to 
participate in this research study for youth participants who were 15 
to 17 years of age. The research team has been granted waivers of 
parental permission for prior studies with sexual minority youth. 
Under 45 CFR 46.408 (c), an IRB has the authority to waive parental 
permission if it determines that “a research protocol is designed for 
conditions or a subject population for which parental or guardian 
permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects” 
and “an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children who will 
participate as research subjects is substituted” and “that the waiver is 
not inconsistent with Federal, State, or local law.” A waiver of 
parental permission for studies with lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth that do not involve 
greater than minimal risk is a common practice among researchers 
working in the area of gay and lesbian health/mental health. This is 
done to avoid the selection biases operating in only recruiting youth 
whose parents are both aware of and comfortable with their sexual

PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882] a Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomization Trial to 
Evaluate AllyQuest
Page 23 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022orientation. Commonly these youth have explored their sexual 
orientation without their parents’ knowledge as the youth struggle 
with issues of disclosure and its consequences within the social, 
religious, and economic context of their families. A requirement for 
parental permission in this type of study could not only affect a 
person’s willingness to participate, but could also potentially impact 
the ability of researchers to engage in this type of research with 
sexual minority youth. Additionally, minors can often seek sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) and HIV prevention services without 
parental/legal guardian permission, depending on each site’s state 
laws.
If the purpose of requiring parental permission as stated in CFR is to 
protect the minor subject, then requiring parental permission for 
youth in these circumstances is not a reasonable requirement.

12.2 N/A
13.0 Recruitment Methods
13.1 We worked closely with the participating SRVs to engage youth. 
This included utilizing in person, venue-based (including recruitment 
from locally specific HIV clinics/providers) and online recruitment 
mechanisms. All participating SRVs either provided ART or had 
close relationships with sites in their community that prescribe. 
Recruitment procedures varied slightly depending on the SRV. This 
study requested a limited waiver of HIPAA to allow clinical sites to 
review patient medical records for recruitment purposes. We also 
followed respondent-driven sampling (RDS) methods and used a 
long-chain referral method to supplement recruitment, especially 
with the adolescents (15-17) who may be harder to reach than young 
adults (18-29).  Online recruitment was also conducted, including 
but not limited to recruiting via online social media outlets (e.g., 
Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.). In addition to recruitment and 
enrollment through the SRVs, recruitment also happened nationally 
through national online recruitment, including but not limited to 
social media recruitment.

methods implemented at Medical University of South Carolina, 
Wayne State University, University of Alabama Birmingham, 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Rutgers University, and

interest in the study were asked to provide informed consent/assent 
for eligibility screening. Those who provided consent/assent viewed 
the aim-specific eligibility screener questions. The screener survey 
could be viewed on participants’ own device or on a computer or 
tablet located in a confidential room at the SRV to determine if they 
meet eligibility criteria. Screening happened onsite and remotely. 
Study staff also administered the screener to participants by [CONTACT_836980]. The participant’s clinical provider could also provide 
clinical information to complete the screener on behalf of the 
participant or with study staff. 
For those who expressed interest in participating, we asked for and 
recorded the first name, e-mail, and phone number of the individual 
via the online screener. We also collected preferred means of contact 
(e.g. call, text, email) and permission to leave a message. We used 
SSL encryption for transfers of information online and data were 
stored in secure, HIPAA-compliant servers. The study staff accessed 
the screener database to determine eligibility. Eligible individuals

15.0 Risks to Subjects
15.1 We identified the following 4 items as possible risks to subjects and 
describe how we plan on addressing those risks:
Breach of Confidentiality: A potential risk to participants is violation 
of confidentiality. We will take the utmost caution to protect the 
confidentiality of all responses. We will minimize this risk by 
[CONTACT_836982]. Files 
– audio, paper, and electronic – will not have any identifying 
information about the study participants and will be tracked through 
a unique SID and participant code. All audio recordings will be 
downloaded and stored on a password-protected, encrypted 
computer in locked offices. Transcription of audio files will be 
conducted using a HIPAA compliant transcription service. Any 
names mentioned in the audio files will be redacted during 
transcription. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_146320]. This research 
specifically includes a vulnerable population, children (YMSM ages 
15-17). We will take every available step to minimize the risk of 
identifying/linking data being subpoenaed, stolen, or inadvertently 
released. First, we have a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
NIH. Second, all research staff members are required to complete 
ethical clearance certification regarding protection of human’s 
subjects. Third, the study will safeguard against the risk of the 
linking information being stolen by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_121777] a 
locked Excel file stored on a secure server to which only essential 
study personnel who have completed CITI certification for human 
subjects’ research ethics training (http://citiprogram.org) will have 
access. We have also included numerous features to ensure app 
security and privacy. All relevant app communications (e.g. those

secured via industry standard encrypted SSL communications links. 
These connections will ensure that all communications are 
inaccessible to unauthorized third parties. Furthermore, the app can 
be updated regularly to address any unforeseen security updates to 
the software libraries underlying the secured communication links. 
Beyond encrypting communication, we will allow users to enable an 
extra PIN to secure the app within their phone beyond the PIN 
required to unlock the phone itself. This will allow the user to share 
their phone generally with others without granting access to the AQ 
study app. These software security solutions will provide the layers 
of both communications security and physical access security to 
ensure that only authorized users have access to the information 
stored on the phone as well as the information being shared over 
communications links. We will take special care to ensure that AQ 
addresses participant privacy. We have chosen the app name, AQ, 
because it does not relate to health care and is therefore designed to 
be non-stigmatizing and un-interpretable by [CONTACT_146359] a 
participant using the app on their mobile phones. During app 
onboarding, study staff will assist youth in choosing a discreet and 
anonymous username. Moreover, mobile phone screens themselves 
are also constructed to prevent surreptitious observation.
Emotional discomfort: It is possible that the study may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_836944]/or an emotional response when YMSM/YTW who 
have sex with men answer questions about potentially sensitive 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_836945]. 
Further, participants may feel embarrassed about discussing sensitive 
issues. All participants will be told during the informed consent 
process that their participation is voluntary and that they can chose to 
stop participating at any time without any consequences. Based on 
our experiences using similar data collections methods with 
YMSM/YTW who have sex with men in past studies, the likelihood 
and seriousness of this risk is minimal and we will strive to create a 
safe and comfortable environment for all study participants.
Discomfort related to blood draws for viral load testing: Participants 
will require three viral load measures during the study: at baseline, 3 
and 6 months. Staff will make every effort to align participants’ data 
collection time points with standard clinic viral load measures. When 
these do not align, an additional blood draw or participant self-
reported VL(via participant shared documentation or participant 
showing SRV staff a VL test result from their online health portal)  
or self-collected DBS will be needed. The risk of discomfort due to 
blood sample collection is considered minimal – and no greater than 
regular standard of care diagnostics. For both standard VL testing 
and DBS, physical harms are minimal. The type of safety lancet 
selected for use in the study was designed to minimize the potential

Page 27 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022for infection or significant injury. Cleaning the area with an alcohol 
pad first lowers the already low infection risk further; pads are 
included in every kit. The spring-loaded lancet retracts fully after 
one firing, and thus does not pose a risk for “needle stick” injury to 
anyone after the device has been used. Subjects could experience 
dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea associated with the procedure but 
in prior clinical studies using dried blood spots, adverse events have

the consent process of the “group rules” regarding interactions with 
one another (e.g., “Honesty is important; however, hostile or abusive 
language will not be tolerated and may be grounds for immediate 
removal from the study”). These “terms of use” will also be 
available with a link on the app for review by [CONTACT_836983]. The project coordinator and/or research assistant will manually 
review participants’ posts on a daily basis to identify any hostile 
interactions or inaccurate information. Hostile interactions between 
participants will be handled by, first, reminding the participants in 
the interaction of the “group rules” regarding appropriate 
interactions. If the hostility continues, the offending participants will 
be given a warning that the continued hostility will result in 
withdrawal from the study if it continues. On the third offense, the 
offending participant will be withdrawn from the study. Text 
containing hostile exchanges will be removed from the study app 
and unavailable to view. In cases in which inaccurate information is 
found, project staff will be guided by [CONTACT_225524] a 
comment that provides accurate information on the topic. In extreme 
cases, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_540485] a participant before the third

address major issues that may come up at study visits or in online 
interactions. The major issues addressed in the procotol will be 
suicidal ideation, homicidality or violent ideation, emotional and 
cognitive disregulation, violent/aggressive or disruptive behavior, 
and intoxication. If research staff see concerning comments or 
messages online from participants regarding self-harm or harm of 
others, they will contact [CONTACT_836984].
All sites have specific policies governing the treatment of human 
subjects. These policies specify that medical and psychological 
assistance will be available in the immediate environment in the

16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects
16.1 The risk to individual participants is small and the potential benefit 
to both the individual and society is substantial. The main benefit of 
the proposed study to society is the development of a potentially 
feasible and acceptable mobile app that improves HIV medication 
adherence, retention in HIV clinical care, and increased social, 
emotional and informational support among YMSM/YTWSM that 
can be scaled up for use in a variety of clinical and community 
settings. Participants may experience improvements in their own 
ART adherence, retention in ART clinical care, and social and 
emotional well-being thereby [CONTACT_836985] (e.g. opportunistic infection, 
detectable viral load) and risks and costs to society (i.e. forward HIV 
transmission, expense of additional medical care, loss of productive 
workforce labor). Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable. Study 
participants will be compensated for their time.
YMSM and YTWSM account for nearly two thirds of all new HIV 
infections in the US and YMSM are the only risk group experiencing 
a significant increase in HIV incidence. Youth are also less likely to 
link to care, and become and maintain consistent viral suppression. 
Given this high potential impact and low potential hazards to 
participants, we find that a clear examination of these research 
questions outweighs the previously mentioned risks. The 
effectiveness of a novel, scalable, technology driven, intervention to 
address ART adherence and retention in clinical care is understudied 
with this population. Given the significant health sequelae associated 
with HIV infections, and the paucity of intervention programs for 
this population of young adults, the knowledge to be gained from

17.0 Data Management and Confidentiality
17.1 Statistical analyses for preliminary intervention efficacy
Using the variables created from paradata sources 1 and 2, we will 
determine which Treatment Strategies (TS) embedded in the 
SMART (escalation, de-escalation, and maintenance combinations, 
Figure 1, TS1 – TS3) result in sustained app engagement, daily app-
reported ART adherence, and VS. First, we will assess VS at [ADDRESS_1161895] to see increases in VS at 3- and 6-months that vary by [CONTACT_152695]. We will calculate the change in the proportion of VS in the AQ 
and AQ+ arms from baseline to month 3. At a significance level of 
0.05, using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and 
assuming 20% attrition (conservatively assumed to occur at 
baseline), the proposed sample size has 85% power to detect a 
medium effect size (Cohen’s h=0.5) and over 99% power to detect a 
large effect size (Cohen’s h=0.8). Second, using AQ paradata and 
participant profiles, we will compare the 3 TS embedded in the 
SMART to determine optimal intervention engagement approaches 
for maximizing app use, daily in-app reported ART adherence, and 
VS. We will compare the following TS which are embedded in the 
trial design: (TS1) assign AQ initially, escalate non-responders to 
AQ+, and have responders continue AQ; (TS2) assign AQ+ initially 
for 3 months, and continue AQ+ regardless of responder status; and 
(TS3) assign AQ+ initially, de-escalate responders to AQ, and have 
non-responders continue AQ+. TS comparisons will be made in 
terms of total app use (minutes and days), in-app daily reported 
adherence, and the rate of VS at 6 months. For VS, at a significance 
level of 0.05 and adjusting for all pairwise comparisons using a 
Bonferroni correction there is 80% power to detect a medium effect 
size (Cohen’s h=0.50).
Exploratory analyses

maximize ART adherence/VS. While the pi[INVESTIGATOR_836947], we will conduct them in order to assess feasibility 
and generate hypotheses and estimates for full SMART sample size 
calculations. To estimate an optimal adaptive TS, we will use an 
estimation method known as non-parametric Q-learning with policy-
search. This method uses a sequence of regressions to estimate the

PROTOCOL TITLE: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882] a Sequential Multiple-Assignment Randomization Trial to 
Evaluate AllyQuest
Page 30 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022marginal mean outcome under any possible adaptive TS and 
subsequently searches for an optimal TS within a parsimonious and 
clinically interpretable class of candidate TS, e.g., those that can be 
expressed as flow-charts or as a sequence of if-then statements. For 
example: if a patient meets clinical criteria for depression at baseline 
screening, then recommend AQ+ initially, otherwise recommend 
AQ; if the patient starts on AQ and responds, then recommend 
continuing on AQ; if the patient starts on AQ but does not respond, 
then recommend escalating treatment to AQ+; if the patient starts on 
AQ+ and responds, then recommend de-escalating to AQ if the 
patient does not report depression in the past 3 months, otherwise 
recommend continuing on AQ+;  if the patient starts on AQ+ and 
does not respond, then recommend continuing on AQ+.   
In addition to generating new clinical hypotheses about how patient 
characteristics should be used to tailor treatment, estimation of an 
optimal adaptive TS can be used to conduct moderation analyses. An 
intermediate step in the Q-learning with policy-search estimation 
algorithm is that one must postulate and fit a model for the 
regression of the outcome on covariates and treatment. This model 
can be used to conduct standard moderation analyses, e.g., test for a 
differential effect of AQ relative to AQ+ among subjects with 
depression.  Furthermore, these models can be used to test whether 
moderators are tailoring variables, i.e., those that would be important 
for choosing a TS. Continuing the example of depression, to test if 
depression is a tailoring variable, we would test if the optimal TS 
that does not make use of depression status results in significantly 
lower adherence/VS rates compared with the overall (unconstrained) 
optimal TS. We will test for moderation and tailoring among known 
risk factors for non-adherence (depression, substance use, unstable 
housing, low social support, and HIV-related stigma) as well as 
additional variables identified during model building for the Q-
learning with policy search algorithm. The results of these analyses 
will inform the design of our full SMART. 
To augment the primary quantitative analyses, we will evaluate 
participants’ app usage and engagement by [CONTACT_225528] 
(e.g. numbers of times per week participants access app, completion 
of daily quests, and average daily use of app), number and content of 
social wall posts, amount of virtual currency collected and rewards 
unlocked. The research team will have access to these data as they 
are transferred from mobile phones to the secure server, which will 
occur any time the participant is connected to the internet via 
broadband or Wi-Fi. For AQ+ we will collect data on number of 
sessions, and content of sessions.

Page 31 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022Several procedures will be used to conduct data analysis when data 
for either outcomes or covariates are missing. The first step will be 
to assess the extent and pattern of missing data. If data are missing 
for only a few cases, then data analysis will be conducted only on 
study participants with complete data. However, when such a 
strategy would result in loss of data from a substantial proportion of 
participants, or if this approach would lead to biased or inaccurate 
results, the multiple imputation scheme for sequential multiple 
assignment randomized trials proposed by [CONTACT_836986]. (2014) 
will be used to account for the missing data.
17.2 All laboratory specimens, questionnaires, evaluation forms, reports, 
transcripts, and other records will be identified by [CONTACT_836987], to maintain participant confidentiality. All 
paper records with personally-identifying information will be kept in 
a locked file cabinet in a limited secure access area at each SRV site. 
All computer entry and networking programs will be done with 
coded numbers only. Clinical information will not be released 
without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for 
monitoring by [CONTACT_4289].
Every effort will be made to ensure that study participants are 
protected from risks. 
Breach of Confidentiality:  A potential risk to participants is 
violation of confidentiality. We will take the utmost caution to 
protect the confidentiality of all responses. We will minimize this 
risk by [CONTACT_836988]. 
Participants may be concerned about the security of their data, 
particularly since it is collected and stored electronically. The 
research team has significant experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_349282]-based studies, and we will take a variety of 
steps to ensure participant security, including using a dedicated 
server behind a firewall, encryption of data, separation of identifiers 
from responses, and password-protected access to data. Therefore, 
we believe that this risk will be minimal. As described above, the 
AQ app includes a number of features to ensure app security and 
privacy. 
Participants will create a unique username [CONTACT_836995]. Intervention participants will choose an anonymous avatar 
(cartoon superhero head) to represent themselves on the app and are 
told at the enrollment visit and in multiple places on the app that it is 
a violation of community guidelines to reveal identifying 
information including name, address, phone number, email address, 
social media handles, places of employment, or locations to meet for

communicate with each other on the app - all conversations are 
viewable on the main feed. Trained research staff will monitor the 
app daily to ensure violations to privacy, even through self-

protected.  
17.3 Certificate of Confidentiality: 
This research specifically targets a vulnerable population, children – 
YMSM/YTWSM ages 15-17. We will take every available step to minimize 
the risk of identifying/linking data being subpoenaed, stolen, or 
inadvertently released. First, per Section [ADDRESS_1161896]  
as implemented in the 2017 NIH Certificates of Confidentiality Policy, all 
ongoing or new research funded by [CONTACT_119185] 13, 2016 that is 
collecting or using identifiable, sensitive information is automatically issued 
a CoC.  As noted on the NIH website 
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/COC/faqs.htm#187), a Certificate of 
Confidentiality will help the research team “...avoid compelled ‘involuntary 
disclosure’ (e.g., subpoenas) of names and other identifying information 
about any individual who participates as a research subject (i.e., about 
whom the investigator maintains identifying information) during any time 
the Certificate is in effect.” 
17.[ADDRESS_1161897]; only those study staff who 
require access to each type of data to complete their study-related 
roles will be allowed access. All study staff will be trained in 
security and confidentiality procedures, and will sign a 
confidentiality agreement before receiving access to any participant 
data. 
We will also develop procedures to minimize indirect disclosure that 
a participant is participating in an HIV- related research study, or a 
study that enrolls MSM/TWSM. For each mode of contact 
[CONTACT_3031], we will ask specifically whether anyone else potentially 
has access to that mode of communication, and if it is acceptable to 
leave a non-specific message about participation in a health study. 
No study-related messages will ever mention HIV or the nature of 
the research study. Additionally, all scripts for email, text message,

The research team will use Dedoose software to perform all 
qualitative analyses. Dedoose is a web-based application for 
organizing and analyzing textual, audio, and video data (qualitative) 
along with outstanding functionality for their integration with 
survey, test score, ratings, and demographic data (quantitative). 
Dedoose employs the highest levels of data encryption available for 
a web application in all data storage, back up, and transmission. 
Dedoose allows for project specific encryption feature. When using 
this feature, only [CONTACT_112543] or her designee will hold the 
additional encryption key needed to be entered in order to view the 
project. This gives [CONTACT_112543] exclusive control over who can view 
the project under any circumstances.
REDCap - a HIPAA-compliant web-based platform – for participant 
management. REDCap was supported by [CONTACT_11604]’s TraCS Clinical 
Research Data Management Service. As specified in their user 
manual: “Standard features of electronic clinical research data 
management systems are available in the web-based systems 
provided with REDCap. These include interactive data entry with 
real-time field validation, lab data imports, audit logs to record 
database modifications, database integrity checks, security (in logins, 
permissions based on need, and encryption), reporting, forms 
inventory, and exports to common statistical packages for analysis. 
Logging tracks all data entered in REDCap so that it can be traced 
back to the person who entered it. No data can be changed without 
showing who has made the changes. This allows the study team to 
ensure the security and integrity of the data collected and submitted; 
therefore, there are controls surrounding this aspect. REDCap also 
provides for principle investigator sign-off on data, as required in 
FDA studies. Although users can modify data based on their 
permissions, they cannot delete the subject or history of that subject.  
Requests to delete a subject must be made to the REDCap system 
administrator. The data is encrypted during transmission.  The 
servers are located in a secure campus area with all appropriate 
physical security measures in place. Access is by [CONTACT_65469], 
and is restricted to the forms and/or functions that the user needs to 
have.  The applications themselves are written using open source 
tools, and have also been scanned by [CONTACT_836990].  
The data is backed up to electronic media on a daily basis.  The 
electronic media is secured by [CONTACT_65471] a secure area separate 
from the servers.

Page 34 of 39 HRP-503 Revised: December 2, 2022interviews at 6-months. When using Zoom, participants will have the 
option to use Zoom in several formats: face-to-face video chat, video 
chat in which they can see the interviewer but the interviewer cannot 
see them, audio chat only, or a text based conversation. Zoom is 
compatible on PCs, tablets, and smartphones; as well as maintains 
the option to conduct an audio conference without the video 
component. All SRVs will be asked to use a HIPAA-compliant 
version of Zoom or a comparable video conferencing platform for 
study visits and qualitative exit interviews. 
End-to-end encryption. Zoom encrypts all presentation content at the 
application layer using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
256-bit algorithm. Zoom end-to-end (E2E) chat encryption allows 
for a secured communication where only the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_836948]. Zoom uses public and private keys to 
encrypt the chat session with Advance Encryption Standard 
(AES256), and session keys are generated with device unique 
hardware ID to avoid data being read from other devices. This 
ensures that the session cannot be eavesdropped or tampered with.
Cloud Control Infrastructure. A distributed network of low-latency 
multimedia routers (software) resides on Zoom’s communications 
infrastructure. With these low-latency multimedia routers, all session 
data originating from the host’s device and arriving at the 
participants’ devices is dynamically switched — never stored 
persistently through the Zoom communications infrastructure. 
Zoom’s communications infrastructure for real-time video, audio, 
and data communications resides on Zoom dedicated servers, which 
are housed in SSAE 16 SOC2 compliant datacenters on opposite 
sides of the US. Zoom sessions are completely temporary and 
operate analogously to the popular mobile conversation over the 
public mobile network. In addition to unique security beneﬁts, 
Zoom’s communications infrastructure also enables an extremely 
scalable and highly available meeting infrastructure unrestricted by 
[CONTACT_112506].
The Zoom client communicates with the multimedia router to 
establish a reliable and secure connection. At the time of 
instantiation, the Zoom client will determine the best method for 
communication, attempting to connect automatically using udp and 
tcp port 8801, 8802 and 8804 or HTTPS (port 443/TLS).
The Zoom sessions will contain identifying information, but this 
information will be stripped form the recorded Zoom sessions before 
they are sent to the analysis team for content analysis. 
Qualtrics may be used for study surveys, online informed 
consent/assent forms, and online HIPAA waivers.

There are three types of untoward effects to be identified: 1) those 
related to the participant, 2) those related to the study staff, and 3) 
those related to the neighborhood/community (if applicable).
First, the study will catalogue any untoward effect related to the 
participant. Reporting is required for occurrences including social 
harms, psychological distress, and serious life-threatening events 
such as suicide attempts. These may be immediately apparent to the 
study staff, such as the participant’s emotional upset state requiring 
referral for counseling; or they may be delayed and reported later to 
study staff, such as physical harm to an individual for having 
participated in the study. Study staff will record these untoward 
effects in the site study log, notify the protocol team, and complete 
appropriate CRFs to document adverse events and social harms. 
Study staff will be briefed during the training on the scope of 
possible untoward effects and instructed to report events.
Second, study staff may encounter untoward events during sessions 
that personally affect them. Training and guidance will seek to 
minimize this risk. Nonetheless, an assessment of the cost of 
conducting this study must include cataloguing these events as well.

All untoward effects/adverse events/unanticipated problems will also 
need to be reported to the FSU IRB if they meet all three of the 
following criteria:
“Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” 
(UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that: is 
unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol-related 
documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied; is related or possibly related to a subject’s 
participation in the research; and 
Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk 
of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
Events that meet the criteria for an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_836949] (1)

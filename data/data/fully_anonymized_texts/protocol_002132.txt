REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 3 of 99 AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Overall Rationale for Amendment 7  
The overall rationale of the amendment is to allow patients who upon their stu dy completion, may 
continue to receive treatment outside of the clinical trial (such as through a Compassionate Use 
Program [CUP], Early Access Program [EAP], or Investigator -Sponsored Study/Trial [ISS/IST]) 
and thereby [CONTACT_104218] 24 -week follow -up peri od of the study.  The follow -up period was 
intended to be an off -drug follow -up.  No off -drug follow -up period is required for these patients.  
In this situation, the patient’s end -of-treatment visit (EOT) will be their last study visit.  
The following tabl e shows the changes made to the protocol with the rationale and the sections 
changed.

The primary purpose for this amendment is to increase the n umber of patients from 100 to 120 
and to add objectives to assess efficacy and safety in adolescent patients with HoFH.  As a result, 
there are also changes to the statistical analyses.  
Change  Section Changed  
Study objectives were added to specifically 
assess efficacy and safety of evinacumab in 
adolescent patients with HoFH. As such, the 
number of patients was increased from 100 to 
approximately 120 to allow additional 
evinacumab -naïve adolescents to enter the study 
and gain experience with evinacumab i n a 
subpopulation of adolescent patients. As a result, 
the analyses were also revised.  Synopsis  ̶ Objectives

After completion of the 2A and 2B versions of the protocol, a country -specific version was 
required, which became R1500 -CL-1719 2B FR. Subsequently, the R1500 -CL-1719 2B FR was 
amended to become R1500 -CL-1719 3B FR. Consequently, to avoid confusion and maintain the 
sequence, the numbering of the present amendment becomes R1500 -CL-1719 4B.  
The protocol was amended in response to recent non -clinical findings  in the rabbit. The table 
below summarizes the changes and the affected sections:  
Change  Sections Changed  
In an embryofetal development 
toxicology study in rabbits, incomplete 
ossification of the 15th vertebra was 
observed in some fetuses resulting from 
the mating of male rabbits exposed to 
evinacumab with female rabbits not 
exposed to evinacumab. In male rabbits, 
there were measurable levels of 
evinacumab in seminal fluid and, as a 
safety measure, the  current clinical study 
is amended to require consistent use of a 
condom for all sexually active males.  Section  3.2.3  Risk/Benefit Assessment

Change  Section Changed  
Revised the eligibility requirements to allow 
patients who have not participated in a previous 
evinacumab study (ie, patients who are 
evinacumab -treatment naïve) to participate in this 
study. The reason for this change is to obtain 
additional long -term safety and tolerability data 
with evinacumab in patients with HoFH.  As  
such, the sample size was increased to allow up 
to 100 patients to enroll in the study.  
Additionally, the following study design changes 
were made and are only applicable to those 
patients who did not participate in a previous 
evinacumab clinical study:  
− Added inclusion criterion for diagnosis 
of functional HoFH  
− Added a requirement for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
− Added an exclusion criterion for LDL -C 
<40 mg/dL at the screening visit  
− Added other exclusion criteria related to 
laboratory findings, physical 
examination, past m edical history, and 
comorbid diseases consistent with those 
patients who enter this study from a 
previous evinacumab study  
− Added an optional run -in period that can 
be used to stabilize background lipid

Title  An Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Long -Term Safety and Efficacy of 
Evinacumab in Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia  
Site Locations  
 Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_104189] -center  
Multi -national  
Objectives  The primary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of evinacumab 
15 mg/kg intravenous (IV) administered every 4 weeks (Q4W) in 
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).  
• To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of evinacumab 
15 mg/kg IV administered Q4W in adolescent patients with HoFH.  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To eva luate the effect of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV on lipid 
parameters (ie, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL -C], 
apolipoprotein  B [Apo B], non -high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
[HDL -C], total cholesterol [TC], and triglycerides [TG]) in patients 
with Ho FH 
• To evaluate the effect of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV on lipid 
parameters (ie, LDL -C, Apo B, non -HDL -C, TC, and TG) in 
adolescent patients with HoFH  
• To evaluate the potential development of anti -evinacumab 
antibodies  
Study Design  This is an open -label study  designed to evaluate the long -term safety and 
efficacy of evinacumab in patients with HoFH.  Eligible patients for this 
study are male and female patients with HoFH, receiving stable lipid 
modifying therapy (LMT), as applicable. Lipid modifying therapy ma y 
include a maximally tolerated statin, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor antibody and lipoprotein 
apheresis.  Patients with HoFH who have participated in a previous 
evinacumab study (eg, R1500 -CL-1331 and R1500 -CL-1629) and 
evinacumab -naïve patients with HoFH are eligible.  
This study consists of 4 periods: a run -in period, a screening period, an 
open -label treatment period, and a follow -up perio d. Patients who upon their 
study completion, may continue to receive treatment outside of the clinical 
trial (such as through a compassionate use program [CUP], early access 
program [EAP], or investigator sponsored study [ISS/IST]) and thereby [CONTACT_104220] 24 -week follow -up period of the study.  The follow -up period was 
intended to be an off -drug follow -up.  No off -drug follow -up period is 
required for these patients.  In this situation, the patient’s end -of-treatment 
visit (EOT) will be their last study visit.

fibrates, 8 weeks for PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies, 12 weeks for lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328], 
24 weeks for mipomersen) or whose apheresis settings and/or schedule (as 
applicable) have not been stable for at least 8 weeks prior to baseline (day1) 
will enter an up to 10 -week run -in period.  
Screening Period:  
All evinacumab -naïve patients who are on a stable background LMT will 
enter a 2 -week screening period.  
Patients who participated previously in an evinacumab study and do not 
enter this study with in 7 days of completing the end of study (EOS) visit of 
the previous study, must undergo screening.   
Open -Label Treatment Period:  
Patients who completed the EOS visit in the previous evinacumab study 
within 7 days of the baseline/day [ADDRESS_115507] 
to undergo the screening visit and may enroll directly into this study if they 
fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  The 
EOS visit from the previous study can serve as the baseline/day  [ADDRESS_115508] been completed in the previous 
evinacumab study.  
Starting on day 1 (baseline), all patients will receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV administered Q4W (±5 days) at the study site. Patients will remain in the 
clinic for monitoring for 60 minutes after the end of each IV infusion. For 
patients unable to go to the site, evinacumab may be administered at an 
alternative location, which could include the patient’s home by a trained 
nurse or other health professional, as allowed by [CONTACT_1207].  
All patie nts who were supplied with alirocumab 150 mg subcutaneous (SC) 
by [CONTACT_104222] a previous study may continue to be provided with 
alirocumab 150 mg SC every 2 weeks (Q2W) in this study. Those entering 
this study after completing a study evaluating the saf ety and efficacy of 
alirocumab in patients with HoFH, but did not participate in a prior 
evinacumab study, may or may not remain on alirocumab as part of their 
background LMT. Based on the patient’s preference and the judgment of the 
investigator and the p atient’s health care provider, each patient may:   
• continue treatment with alirocumab supplied by [CONTACT_104223]  
• discontinue alirocumab prior to enrolling into this study  
• change to a commercially available PCSK9 inhibitor antibody

clinical labor atory samples drawn and study assessments performed before 
undergoing the procedure. Every effort should be made for the patient to 
receive study drug immediately after completion of the apheresis procedure, 
but patients can receive study drug 1 day before  the apheresis procedure. 
Patients on plasma exchange should receive the study drug immediately after 
completing the procedure.  
Patients receiving background LMT, which has been proven to reduce the 
risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) ( eg, statins, 
ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies), should make their best effort to 
maintain a stable regimen for at least 24 weeks and for the duration of the 
study.  
Patients receiving other LMT (eg, apheresis, lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328]) may have that LMT 
adjusted af ter week 24, based on their LDL -C, cardiovascular (CV) risk 
factors, and judgment of the investigator.   
Patients should be on a stable heart healthy diet and exercise regimen 
throughout the duration of the study, starting at the baseline visit and 
continu ing through the end of the open -label treatment period.  
Evinacumab treatment will continue until one of the following occurs:  
• Clinical development of evinacumab for the indication described 
in this study protocol is discontinued  
• Clinical development of evinacumab is terminated  
• Risk/benefit of evinacumab in this patient population is deemed 
unfavorable  
• Evinacumab is approved by [CONTACT_104224]*  
• For local discontinuation of study: a decision has been made n ot 
to seek approval of an indication for treatment of patients with 
HoFH in the regulatory region in which the study is being 
conducted (or, to discontinue efforts to obtain such an approval)  
*Note, if in a region evinacumab is not commercially available o r available 
through an early access or compassionate use program, treatment may 
continue in that region.  
Patients who prematurely discontinue from study drug should return to the 
clinic (within 5 days if possible), for end of treatment visit assessments.  A 
final end of study (EOS) visit should take place with assessments as 
specified in the EOS visit at [ADDRESS_115511] dose of study drug.   
Follow -up Period:  
Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_115512] dose of study drug 
either during clinic visits or by [CONTACT_104225].  Patients who upon their study 
completion, may continue to receive treatment outside of the clinical trial 
(such as through a CUP, EAP, or ISS/IST) and thereby [CONTACT_104226] [ADDRESS_115513] 2022 GMT-5:00

• The percent and absolute change in TC over time  
• The percent and absolute change in TGs over time  
Procedures and Assessments  Overall safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_10056]/evaluation of TEAEs, physical 
examinations, electrocardiograms, and clinical safety laboratory tests at 
pre-specified time points.  The  potential emergence of anti -evinacumab 
antibodies will also be evaluated.   
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_104229]-specified time points throughout the study.    
Statistical Plan  No formal statistical testing wi ll be performed for this open -label study.  The 
safety analysis set (SAF) includes all patients who received at least 1 dose 
or part of a dose of open -label study treatment in this study.  The SAF will 
be the main analysis set for exposure/compliance, clin ical safety and 
efficacy.   
All safety analyses summaries will be descriptive in nature and no formal 
inferential testing will be performed.   
The percent and absolute change in lipid data (eg, LDL -C, Apo B, TG) will 
be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_765].  Missing data will not be imputed.   
For both safety and efficacy analyses, the baseline for each patient is defined 
as follows:   
• For patients who participated in a previous evinacumab study, 
R1500 -CL-1629, baseline is defined as the last obtained value before 
the first dose of double -blind study drug in R1500 -CL-1629  
• For patients who participated in the previous evinacumab study

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 30 of 99 1. INTRODUCTION  
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism that predisposes 
a person to premature severe cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( Kolansky 2008 ). Familial 
hypercholesterolemia can be either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive disease that 
results from mutations in the low -density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), or in 3 associated genes: 
proprotein c onvertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9); apolipoprotein B (APOB); and 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1) with a similar phenotype 
and varying severity.  
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare, serious co ndition that is frequently 
caused by [CONTACT_104231] -of-function mutations in both alleles of the LDL receptor gene, resulting in the 
decreased clearance of LDL particles from plasma.  Patients with HoFH have severe 
hypercholesterolemia (500 -1000 mg/dL), resulting in  lifelong exposure to high levels of plasma 
LDL and increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_104190].  Accelerated atherosclerosis results in 
premature CVD and an increased risk of a cardiovascular event.  Although double -blind 
cardiovascular outcome data in t his rare population do not exist, observational studies suggest 
that lowering low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) with statin therapy may reduce the 
risk of coronary heart disease by 50% to 80% in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia 
(Harada -Shiba 2010 ) (Huijgen  2010 ) (Vermissen  2008 ) (Neil 2008 ). The goal of drug therapy in 
adult patients with FH is to achieve LDL -C reduction ≥50% ( Goldberg 2011 ); however, 
management of elevated LDL -C in patients with HoFH is challenging with the current existing 
treatment options.  Because patients with HoFH have impaired or deficient LDL -receptor 
function, they tend to be refr actory to statins because the mechanism of action generally lowers 
LDL -C levels through up -regulation of the hepatic LDL receptor.  
Statins can reduce LDL -C by [CONTACT_726] 50% in other hypercholesterolemic patients, in HoFH 
patients; however, statins may pro vide a decrease of <15 to 30% ( Crestor 2003 ) (Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133] 1996 ) 
(Zocor 1991 ). When ezetimibe is added to a statin, LDL -C may be reduced by 21 to 27% 
(Zetia  2002 ), but many patients with HoFH treated with a high dose statin and ezetimibe remain 
far from their target LDL -C.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_104191], statins are still used as first line therapy in order to m aximize residual receptor activity 
(Raal 2000 ) (Marais 2008 ) (Raal 1997 ). 
Mipomersen and lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104192], and provid e an additional ~25% and 40% reduction in LDL -C, respectively, when used 
along with other lipid -modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (LMT).  However, these new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104193], and are associated with increases in hepatic fat conte nt 
and liver function tests, and frequent injection site reactions (mipomersen) or gastrointestinal 
side effects (lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328]) that can impact tolerability ( Raal 2010 , Cuchel 2013 ). 
While PCSK9 inhibitor  antibody therapy may provide modest efficacy in the treatment of many 
patients with HoFH patients with hypercholesterolemia, it appears to be minimally effective in 
patients with impaired LDL -receptor activity, particularly those patients with null mutati ons in 
both LDLR alleles ( Raal 2014 ). 
In the recent TESLA study comparing evolocumab on top of statins (with or without ezetimibe) 
in patients with HoFH, the mean percent reduction in LDL -C at week 12 was 23.1% ( Raal 2014 ).

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 31 of 99 Evolocumab therapy did not reduce LDL -C in patients with LDL receptor -negative mutations in 
both alleles ( Raal 2014 ) (Repatha 2015 ). 
High -dose statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor anti bodies, mipomersen, and lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104194], but many patients still require lipid apheresis.  Lipid 
apheresis can be effective, but entails weekly or bi -weekly treatments, lasting several hours, is 
both costly and associ ated with a risk of infections ( Vella 2001 ) (Kajinami 1999 ), and is not 
routinely available ( Thompson 2010 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_104195] -modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104196], as well as mechanical removal by [CONTACT_101810], many patients with 
HoFH remain far from their LDL -C treatment goal.  Therefore, the need for more intensive 
treatment in HoFH, especially those patients with double null mutations, remains.  
Angiopoi etin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) has recently emerged as a potential target for the treatment of 
elevated levels of triglycerides (TG), and for the treatment of elevated levels of LDL -C, both 
factors in the development of CVD. Angiopoietin -like 3 (ANGPTL3) acts as a natural inhibitor 
of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an endothelial -bound enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of the TG 
content of very -low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicron lipoproteins. Patients who are 
homozygous for loss -of-function (LOF) mutations i n ANGPTL3 have lower levels of LDL -C 
(mean difference of 48% versus control family members). The mechanism by [CONTACT_31572]3 
LOF mutations result in lowered LDL -C levels is not fully understood, but appears to be 
independent of the effects on TGs. It is not eworthy that patients with [ADDRESS_115536] reported reductions in serum high -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) 
levels. The mechanism for this may be linked to the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL3 on 
endothelial lipase (EL), which is involved in the hydrolysis of HDL phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. Importantly, 
no health deficits have been reported in the (relatively small number of) patients who are 
homozygous for ANGPTL3 LOF mutations. These data suggest that inhibiting ANGPTL3 may 
be a meaningful an d well -tolerated strategy for lowering serum LDL C and TGs.  
Evinacumab (REGN1500) is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb), created with 
Regeneron’s VelocImmune technology platform, which specifically binds to ANGPTL3.  
Evinacumab (REGN1500) is a fully h uman monoclonal antibody, created with Regeneron's 
VelocImmune® technology platform, which specifically binds to ANGPTL3 and prevents its 
inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, thereby [CONTACT_104232]. Experiments performed in 
animals demonstrate th at the administration of evinacumab results in a reduction of serum LDL 
C and serum TGs.  In an open -label, single -arm, proof -of-concept (POC) study in patients with 
genetically -defined HoFH (Study R1500 -CL-1331), treatment with evinacumab in 9 patients 
resulted in a mean percent reduction of LDL -C from baseline of 49.2% at week 4 (the primary 
endpoint).  A peak mean reduction of 52.1% was observed at week 6.  Three patients enrolled in 
Study R1500 CL 1331 are homozygous for null mutations in the LDL -R.  Ev inacumab provided 
37.3% (range: 26 -44%) reductions in LDL -C at week 4 in these 3 null/null HoFH patients.  
Evinacumab in this POC study has been well tolerated.

reduction for evinacumab compared to a 2% increase for placebo, p<0.0001). This reduction 
corresponds to a mean absolute change in LDL -C of 132 mg/dL from baseline, compared to 
placebo (135 mg/dL reduction for e vinacumab compared to a 3 mg/dL reduction for placebo, 
p<0.0001). The decreases in LDL -C were observed from the first lipid assessment at week [ADDRESS_115538] difficult -to-treat null/null or 
negative/negative patients. The dramatic reduction in LDL -C led to the achievement of LDL -C 
levels <100 mg/dL in 47% of the patients treated with evinacumab compared to 23% treated with 
placebo (nominal p=0.0203). Evinacumab also significantly reduced apolipoprotein B (Apo B), 
non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (non -HDL -C) and total cholesterol (TC) 
compared to placebo.  
The positive efficacy data in the R1500 -CL-1629 study were a ccompanied by [CONTACT_31573]. Evinacumab was generally well -tolerated. During the double -blind treatment 
period, 66% of evinacumab patients and 81% of placebo patients experienced an adverse event 
(AE). AEs that occurred in at least 5% of pat ients and more commonly with evinacumab were 
influenza -like illness (11% evinacumab, 0% placebo) and rhinorrhea (7% evinacumab, 0% 
placebo). During the double -blind treatment period, there were no AEs leading to death or 
discontinuation of study treatment.  Two patients (4.5%), both in the evinacumab treatment 
group, experienced 1 serious TEAE (SAE) each (urosepsis and suicide attempt); neither of the 
events were considered related to therapy or led to discontinuation of study treatment and both 
were reporte d to be recovered/resolved. Treatment with evinacumab was not associated with any 
safety concerns related to hepatic TEAEs or laboratory parameters, muscle events or CK 
elevations, pancreatitis, neurocognitive events, neurologic events, cataracts, new onse t diabetes 
(NOD), diabetic complications, or immune complex diseases. A review of safety labs, vital 
signs, and ECG did not reveal any significant differences between evinacumab treatment and 
placebo.  
This study was designed to evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of evinacumab in 
participants with HoFH who are either evinacumab naïve, or have participated in other 
evinacumab studies (ie, R1500 -CL-1331, R1500 -CL-1629). All participants received

3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypothesis  
Blockade of ANGPTL3 with evinacumab will reduce or maintain consistent long -term reduction 
in LDL -C and demonstrate an acceptable safety profile in patients with HoFH.   
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
This study is being conducted in patients with H oFH, which may include patients who have 
participated in a previous evinacumab study (eg, R1500 -CL-1331, R1500 -CL-1629) and also 
evinacumab -naïve patients with HoFH.  The study is intended to provide long -term safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) inf ormation on evinacumab treatment of adult and 
adolescent patients with HoFH.  The study population will include individuals ≥12 years of age.  
Because this disease is characterized by [CONTACT_101865], 
subsequently, the onset of p remature CVD during childhood, the HoFH population includes 
children and adolescents. Allowing individuals ≥[ADDRESS_115540] 2022 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol   R1500 -CL-1719 Amendment 7 
 
REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 34 of 99 Considering the severity of this disease, evinacumab will be added on top of the patient’s 
background LMT, including statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors.  Patients receiving 
background LMT that has been proven to reduce the risk of ASCV D (eg, statins, ezetimibe, 
PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies) should make their best effort to maintain a stable regimen for the 
entire duration of the study. This guidance is provided so that patients will be able to receive 
maximal benefit from the treatment. P atients receiving other LMT (eg, apheresis, lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328]) 
may have that LMT adjusted after week 24, based on their LDL -C, CV risk factors, and the 
judgment of the investigator.  
This study employs a single -arm, open -label design, which is appropriate since th e primary 
objective of this study is long -term safety and tolerability.  A run -in period is included to ensure 
all patients entering this study are on a stable background LMT regimen. This is important 
because a stable background LMT regimen will ensure a stable LDL -C at the onset of the study, 
which is necessary to adequately assess the secondary objective of efficacy, particularly for the 
evinacumab -naïve patients entering this study.  
The study population will include patients with HoFH, diagnosed by [CONTACT_104233][INVESTIGATOR_007].  Patients entering this study from another evinacumab trial will not have to fulfill an 
LDL -C entry criterion. No criterion is applied to this population because most of the patients had 
to fulfill an LDL -C entry criteri on of ≥70 mg/dL prior to entering the previous evinacumab study 
in which they participated. These patients are transitioning into this study with the goal of 
maintaining their LMT regimen (including evinacumab) and thus maintaining their LDL -C.  This 
stabi lity allows for the evaluation of the long -term safety and efficacy of evinacumab in patients 
with HoFH.  
Patients who are evinacumab -naïve will have to fulfill an LDL -C criterion of ≥70 mg/dL at 
screening.  This threshold is the target LDL -C recommended in  the different treatment guidelines 
for patients at very high risk for ASCVD, which includes patients with HoFH ( Grundy, 2018 ) 
(Catapano, 2016 ). 
Another consideration for the LDL -C entry criterion in this  study is that for this severe patient 
population that falls at the very extreme end of the spectrum of patients with 
hypercholesterolemia, LDL -C levels should be managed so that they are as low as possible. As 
mentioned above, patients with HoFH have seve re hypercholesterolemia (≥500 mg/dL). Plasma 
levels of LDL -C are elevated from birth, with reports of elevations greater than [ADDRESS_115541] 
possible LDL -C for as long as possible ( Gidding 2015 ). 
Although double -blind cardiovascular outcome data in this rare population do not exist, 
observational studies suggest that lowering LDL -C with statin therapy may reduce t he risk of 
coronary heart disease by 50% to 80% in patients with FH ( Harada -Shiba 2010 ) (Huijgen 2010 ) 
(Vermissen 2008 ) (Neil 2008 ).  Additionally, recent outcomes data with ezetimibe, evolocumab, 
and alirocumab for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD in high risk patients with 
hypercholesterolemia have further demonstrated that, similar to statins, other lipid lowering 
agents can also signific antly reduce the risk of CHD.  The LDL -C levels achieved in these recent 
outcomes studies ranged from a median of 30 mg/dL in the evolocumab outcomes study 
                                        VV-RIM-00180158-4.[ADDRESS_115542] 2022 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol   R1500 -CL-1719 Amendment 7 
 
REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 35 of 99 (FOURIER) ( Sabatine 2017 ) to approximately 50 mg/dL in the studies with ezetimibe 
(IMPROVE -IT) (Cannon 2015 ) and alirocumab (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES) ( Steg 2018 ). 
Importantly, these LDL -C levels were associated with a 7 to 15% reduction in cardiovascular 
events ( Cannon 2015 , Sabatine 2017 , Steg 2018 ). When these data are positioned within the 
context of this study, it provides additional evidence for the LDL -C entry criteria outlined.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Select ion 
The evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W dose regimen to be studied in this study is the dose regimen 
evaluated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in patients with HoFH 
(R1500 -CL-1629). It was selected based on safety in the phase 1 a nd phase 2 studies and the 
substantial LDL -C reduction observed with that dose in HoFH patients in study R1500 -CL-1331. 
The 15 mg/kg IV Q4W dose regimen will continue to be evaluated in this study to obtain 
long-term safety, additional efficacy, and PK inf ormation, with the intended dose for registration 
in patients with HoFH.  
The higher dose regimen of 20 mg/kg IV Q4W demonstrated favorable tolerability when given 
as an 8 -week treatment in otherwise healthy subjects (R1500 -CL-1321).  Long -term 
administrati on of evinacumab at the 15 mg/kg IV Q4W regimen is expected to also demonstrate 
favorable tolerability because the evinacumab exposure within each dosing interval is expected 
to be lower than 20 mg/kg IV and the accumulation of serum concentration with a m onthly 
dosing frequency is predicted to be minimal.  From an efficacy perspective, the 15 mg/kg IV 
dose resulted in evinacumab concentrations above 100 mg/L for approximately [ADDRESS_115543] on TG reduction 
(R1500 -CL-1321 and R1500 -HV-1214).  Based on these PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) data, 
combined with the efficacy data from the POC study in HoFH (R1500 -CL-1331), 15 mg/kg IV is 
expected to maintain target saturation and thereby, provide maxi mal benefit during the monthly 
dosing interval.   
Pharmacokinetics information is not available from patients aged 12 to 17 years.  Evinacumab 
systemic elimination features a combination of linear clearance and non -linear, target -driven 
clearance.  The lin ear clearance for monoclonal antibodies is often similar between adults and 
adolescents after adjusting for body -weight.  The comparison of nonlinear clearance between 
adolescents and adults is not known.  However, at 15 mg/kg IV, the contribution of 
targe t-mediated clearance is likely to be low since target saturation appeared to be present.  
Therefore, evinacumab clearance in adolescents is likely to be similar to adults and the same 
dose as the adult dose is expected to yield evinacumab exposure in the r ange associated with 
observed efficacy and tolerability in adults.  In the event that PK information from adolescent 
patients becomes available while this study is ongoing, and data suggest meaningful differences 
in PK/PD between adolescents and adults, an  amendment to the protocol will be considered to 
modify the dose of study drug for adolescent patients.   
3.2.3.  Risk/Benefit Assessment  
As mentioned above, patients with HoFH have a lifetime burden of extremely high LDL -C 
levels . These life -long exposures to pro found hypercholesterolemia is directly responsible for 
vascular endothelial damage and accelerated atherosclerosis, greatly increasing the risk for 
premature coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease, and valvular disease, 
                                        VV-RIM-00180158-4.[ADDRESS_115544] 2022 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_115545] decade of life ( Ito 2015 , Cuchel 2014 ). 
The goal of therapy in these patie nts is to slow the progression of atherosclerosis with the aim of 
reducing CV events and mortality. Patients with HoFH should be provided aggressive 
interventions to achieve these goals. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_104198], including 
evolocumab, lomit api[INVESTIGATOR_5328], and mipomersen, the need for more intensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101774]. 
Evinacumab could be a new addition to the armamentarium of LMT that could contribute to 
lowering the LDL -C in patients with HoFH.  
The ACC/AHA and the EAS guidelines for FH both recommen d an initial goal of at least a 
50% reduction in LDL -C in patients with FH to reduce the risk of CVD ( Gidding 2015 , 
Cuchel  2014 ). The EAS Consensus Panel recommends that lipid -lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104199]. This is based on evidence that initiation of 
treatment early can delay the onset of clinically evident ASCVD. If the 50% reduction in LDL -C 
is achieved, the ACC/AHA and EAS additionally recommends furt her LDL -C lowering to 
achieve LDL -C levels of <100 mg/dL (<2.5 mmol/L) in the absence of CAD or other major risk 
factors or <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L) in the presence of ASCVD or other major risk factor 
(Gidding 2015 , Cuchel 2014 ).  A limitation to both sets of recommendations is that they are 
based on clinical trials of patients without FH because of the lack of true long -term outcome 
studies in patients with FH. Indeed, due to the long -term sequelae of ext remely elevated levels of 
LDL -C described above, at a minimum patients with HoFH need to achieve the goals described 
in the guidelines, but would benefit from more aggressive treatments to achieve the lowest 
LDL -C possible for as long as possible ( Gidding 2015 ). 
Historically, these LDL -C targets have been challenging to achieve with the available treatment 
options, in part because the mutations observed in this patient population renders major classes 
of lipid lowering treatments as either ineffective or less efficacious.  However, with additional, 
newer classes of pharmacotherapy, achieving these goals and even lowering LDL -C beyond 
these goals is slowly becoming a reality.  Moreover, results of several recent outcomes trials 
sugg est that achieving lower LDL -C levels than the current recommended target levels may 
provide additional CV benefit. The LDL -C levels achieved in the outcomes studies with 
ezetimibe, evolocumab, and alirocumab ranged from a median of 30 mg/dL in the evolocu mab 
outcomes study (FOURIER) ( Sabatine 2017 ) to approximately 50 mg/dL in the studies with 
ezetimibe (IMPROVE -IT) (Cannon 2015 ) and alirocumab (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES) 
(Steg 2018 ). The se LDL -C levels were associated with a 7 -15% reduction in cardiovascular 
events ( Cannon 2015 , Sabatine 2017 , Steg 2018 ). Additionally, the LDL -C levels in all 3 studies 
were also  associated with an acceptable safety profile.   
Considering the growing evidence for aggressively treating LDL -C, even in the setting of what 
some might consider patients with HoFH that might be at their “goal” LDL -C (ie, 70 mg/dL), the 
benefits of adding  evinacumab and potentially lowering the LDL -C even further become 
apparent. For patients entering this study from another evinacumab trial there is no LDL -C entry 
criterion as these patients would have been treated with evinacumab for at least [ADDRESS_115546] 2022 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_115547] difficult -to-treat patients with null/null 
mutations in the LDLR gene. Recent data from study R1500 -CL-1629 in adult and adolescent 
patients with HoFH demonstrated that adding evinacumab to other lipid -lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104197] -C by a mean of 49% from baseline  to week 24. This efficacy data was 
accompanied by [CONTACT_104234]. AEs that occurred in at least 5% of patients and 
more commonly with evinacumab were influenza -like illness (11% evinacumab, 0% placebo) 
and rhinorrhea (7% evinacumab, 0% place bo). The accumulated safety information from the 
completed and ongoing clinical studies had identified the risk of systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions (including anaphylaxis and infusion reactions). The important potential risks (based on 
preclinical evalu ation or risks associated with monoclonal antibodies in general) include 
embryofetal toxicity and immunogenicity. These risks will be managed through careful patient 
selection, routine monitoring, and complete disclosure of safety information.  
Patients ent ering this study should be on a stable background LMT, which may or may not 
include a statin, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9 inhibitor.  There are 2 PCSK9 inhibitors that are 
commercially available in many countries; evolocumab is approved for use in patients with  
HoFH in most countries, and alirocumab is currently being evaluated in a phase 3 double -blind 
placebo -controlled study in patients with HoFH (study R727 -CL-1628, ODYSSEY HoFH). 
Patients entering this study may be taking either evolocumab or alirocumab. Pa tients who 
complete study R727 -CL-1628 (ODYSSEY HoFH) with alirocumab are permitted to participate 
in this study and may continue to receive alirocumab as part of their background LMT.  
Evinacumab and PCSK9 inhibitors, including alirocumab have different m echanisms of action 
and concomitant administration of both agents is not expected to perturb the action of the other. 
Rather, their distinct mechanisms of action are anticipated to complement each other to lower 
LDL -C since they work at different sites of action. Additionally, the safety profile of each agent 
is considered acceptable and the concurrent use of the 2 agents together is not expected to 
augment or exacerbate potential AEs. From the perspective of PK drug -drug interactions, 
co-administration of evinacumab with a PCSK9 inhibitor and the other possible background 
LMT (statin, ezetimibe, etc) is not expected to result in drug -drug interactions with each other or 
other drugs. Therefore, the concurrent use of evinacumab with PCSK9 inhibitors, includin g 
alirocumab is considered to have an acceptable benefit/risk profile.  
The safety of the use of evinacumab alone or concomitantly with alirocumab will be carefully 
monitored in this study. Safety monitoring will include ongoing reviews by [CONTACT_104235] (IDMC) and by [CONTACT_456]’s safety monitoring team and clinical study 
team. If significant safety trends or findings are identified by [CONTACT_101870], 
they will be escalated and appropriately evaluated to understand the best course of action.  
Taken together, the benefit/risk profile for the treatment with evinacumab in patients with HoFH 
is considered to be favorable and additional reduction in LDL -C may translate into significant 
clinical benefit.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 41 of 99 Open -Label Treatment Period:  
Patients who completed the EOS visit in the previous evinacumab study within 7 days of the 
baseline/day 1 visit for this open label study do not ha ve to undergo the screening visit and may 
enroll directly into this study if they fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria.   
The EOS visit from the previous study can serve as the baseline/day [ADDRESS_115555] been  completed in the 
previous evinacumab study.  
Starting on day 1 (baseline), patients will receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV administered Q4W 
(±7 days)  at the study site. Patients will remain in the clinic for monitoring for 60 minutes after 
the end of each IV infusion.  For patients unable to go to the site, evinacumab may be 
administered at an alternative location, which could include the patient’s home by a trained nurse 
or other health professional, as allowed by [CONTACT_1207].  
All patients who were supplied wi th alirocumab 150 mg subcutaneous (SC) by [CONTACT_104222] a 
previous study may continue to be provided with alirocumab 150 mg SC every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
in this study. Those entering this study, after completing a study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of ali rocumab in patients with HoFH, but did not participate in a prior evinacumab 
study, may or may not remain on alirocumab as part of their background LMT.  
Based on the patient’s preference and the judgment of the investigator and the patient’s health 
care p rovider, each patient may:  
• continue treatment with alirocumab supplied by [CONTACT_104236]  
• discontinue alirocumab prior to enrolling  
• change to a commercially available PCSK9 inhibitor antibody prior to enrolling into 
this study  
Clinical laboratory samples must be collected and study assessments must be performed before 
study drug is administered.   
Patients who are undergoing apheresis or plasma exchange must have their clinical laboratory 
samples drawn and study assessments perfo rmed before undergoing the procedure. Every effort 
should be made for the patient to receive study drug immediately after completion of the 
apheresis procedure, but patients can receive study drug [ADDRESS_115556] 2022 GMT-5:00

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 42 of 99 Patients receiving background LMT that has been proven to reduce the risk of ASCVD 
(eg, statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor  antibodies) should make their best effort to maintain a 
stable regimen after week 24 and for the duration of the study.  
Patients receiving other LMT (eg, apheresis, lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328]) may have that LMT adjusted after 
week  24, based on their LDL -C levels, CV ris k factors, and judgment of the investigator.   
Patients should be on a stable heart healthy diet and exercise regimen throughout the duration of 
the study, starting at the baseline visit and continuing through the end of the open -label treatment 
period.  
Treatment will continue until 1 of the following occurs:  
• Clinical development of evinacumab for the indication described in this study 
protocol is discontinued  
• Clinical development of evinacumab is terminated  
• Risk/benefit of evinacumab in this patient popu lation is deemed unfavorable  
• Evinacumab is approved by [CONTACT_104237]*  
• For local discontinuation of study:  a decision has been made not to seek approval of 
an indication for treatment of patients with HoFH in the regulatory region in which 
the study is being conducted (or, to discontinue efforts to obtain such an approval)  
*Note, if in a region evinacumab is not commercially available or available through an early 
access or compassionate use program, tr eatment may continue in that region.  
Overall safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_10056]/evaluation of treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECG), and clinical safety laboratory tests 
at pre -specified time points.  The potential emergence of anti -evinacumab antibodies will also be 
evaluated.  Patients who experience an ongoing serious adverse event (SAE) at the study end 
date should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or collection of outcome and related da ta.   
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_104238] -specified time 
points throughout the study.   
Patients who prematurely discontinue from study drug should return to the clinic (within 5 days 
if possible), for end of treatment visit assessments.  A final EOS visit should take place with 
assessments as specified in the EOS visit at [ADDRESS_115557] dose of study drug.

Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_115558] dose of stud y drug.  During this time, 
pregnancy status of all women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), including those who 
discontinue prematurely from the study will be monitored every [ADDRESS_115559]

The Clinical Events Comm ittee (CEC) is composed of experts in the field of CVD, independent 
of the sponsor and the investigators.  This committee will be responsible for defining, validating, 
and classifying (in a blinded fashion) pre -specified cardiovascular (CV) events and all deaths.   
Patients with suspected or confirmed CV events that occur from study entry until the end of the 
study will have a corresponding adjudication package prepared and submitted to the CEC.  The 
events should also be reported as SAEs, as appropriate.  Adjudicated CV events include all CV 
AEs positively adjudicated.  The adjudication categories include:   
• Coronary heart disease death  
• Nonfatal myocardial infarction  
• Fatal and nonfatal ischemic stroke  
• Unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Congestive he art failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101778], other deaths (besides coronary heart disease deaths) will be classified by [CONTACT_15741]. 
All coronary revascularizations (percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery by[CONTACT_101874]) will be submit ted to the CEC and analyzed.   
A charter and an adjudication operational manual will specify additional details regarding the 
procedures, criteria, and classification used for adjudication of these events.

longer in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow 
study procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  8.1.4 .  
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) a re discussed in 
Section  7.3.2 .

7.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
Eligible patients will receive open -label evinacumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W starting on 
day 1. Patients will be  monitored for at least 60  minutes after the end of each IV infusion, and 
vital signs will be obtained pre -dose and 30 minutes and 60 minutes after the end of the IV 
infusion.  
The IV dose should be prepared using the patient’s most recent weight. Further instructions on 
dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
Dosing should fall within a window of ±7 days; if >14 days has passed, skip the dose and return 
to the ori ginal schedule . 
Instructions on management of infusion reactions and injection site reactions are provided in 
Section  7.4.  
7.2. Background Treatment(s)  
Patients who are undergoing apheresis therapy must have initiated LDL apheresis at least 
[ADDRESS_115593] receive stable weekly apheresis (every 7 ±1 days), or other 
stable regimen (±2 days) and/or stable settings for at least 8 weeks pr ior to screening. Patients 
whose schedule and/or apheresis settings have not been stable for at least [ADDRESS_115594] 4 w eeks (6 weeks for 
fibrates, 8 weeks for PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies) before the screening visit will enter a run -in 
period to stabilize their LMT before entering the screening period.  
Patients receiving background LMT that has been proven to reduce the risk  of ASCVD 
(eg, statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies), should make their best effort to maintain a 
stable regimen after week 24 and for the duration of the study.  
Patients receiving other LMT (eg, apheresis, lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328]) may have that LMT adjusted  after 
week  24, based on their LDL -C, CV risk factors, and judgment of the investigator.

7.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.3.1.  Dose Mod ification  
Dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
7.3.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study 
will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visit s per the visit schedule.  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  8.1.4 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Acute systemic infusion reactions with AEs including, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, 
laryngeal/pharyngeal edema, severe bronchospasm, chest pain, seizure, or severe 
hypotension  
• Serious or severe allergic reactions considered related to study drug

informed consent to the end of the treatment period/final study visit will be considered 
concomitant medication. This includes medications that were started before the st udy and are 
ongoing during the study.  
7.7.1.  Permitted Medications and Procedures  
The use of all medications and nutritional supplements known to alter serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], including 
(but not limited to) statins, ezetimibe, fibrates, niacin, bile acid resins, red yeast rice, lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328], 
mipomersen, and PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies is permitted a s long as that therapy has been 
initiated prior to the baseline visit (day 1) and has been stable for at least 4 weeks (6  weeks for 
fibrates, 8  weeks for PCSK9 inhibitor antibody therapy, 12 weeks for lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328], 6  months for 
mipomersen).   
Patients from p revious evinacumab studies who are receiving background LMT or who are 
undergoing apheresis should continue the same stable LMT and a stable apheresis schedule 
(as applicable) as at the time of the EOS visit of the previous study without any adjustments.  
The use of lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104206] 12 weeks prior to the baseline visit (day 1). If lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104207] (day 1), there should be at least an 8 -week wa shout period prior to 
the baseline visit.  
Lipoprotein apheresis is permitted as long as the patient's schedule and setting have been stable 
for at least 8 weeks prior to the baseline visit.  All patients on lipoprotein apheresis should make 
every effort to  adhere to their stable weekly regimen (every 7 ±1 days), or other stable regimen

(day 1), there should be at least a 6 -week washout period prior to the baseline visit.  
Plasma exchange is also allowed. The patient should be on a stable schedule, and study drug 
administration should occur after the procedure.  
Patients’ apheresis schedule and lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104208] (if applicable) may be adjusted after 
week  24, based on their LDL -C, CV risk factors, and judgment of the investigator.   
Patients receiving background LMT that has been proven to reduce the risk of ASCVD 
(eg, statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9s inhibitor antibodies) should make their best effort to maintain a 
stable re gimen after study week 24 and for the duration of the study.  
7.7.2.  Prohibited Medications and Procedures  
The following concomitant medications and procedures are prohibited for the duration of the 
study (unless already stable on the medication or procedure prior  to the baseline visit):  
• Background mipomersen treatment that has not been stable for 24 weeks (6 months) 
before baseline (day 1)  
• Nutraceuticals and all medications known to alter serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], at a dose/amount that 
has not been stable for at least 4 week s prior to baseline (day 1)  
• Thyroid replacement therapy, unless the dosage of replacement therapy has been 
stable for at least 12 weeks prior to baseline (day 1)  
• Background maximally tolerated dose of lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104209] 
12 weeks before  baseline (day 1); washout period less than 8 weeks prior to baseline 
(day 1) in cases when lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104210]; any 
changes in lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_104211] 24.  
• Background PCSK9 inh ibitor antibody therapy that has not been stable for at least 
8 weeks prior to baseline (day 1)  
• Lipoprotein apheresis that has not been stable for at least 8 weeks prior to the baseline 
visit; apheresis schedule that is not an every 7 day (±1 day), or othe r stable schedule 
(±2 days); any changes to apheresis schedule or settings prior to week 24; washout 
period less than 6 weeks prior to baseline (day 1) in cases when apheresis was 
discontinued prior to enrollment.  
• Any changes to the background LMT during p articipation in this study prior to at 
least week 24  
Note: Patients from previous evinacumab studies who are receiving background LMT or who are 
undergoing apheresis should continue the same stable LMT and a stable apheresis schedule (as 
applicable) as at the time of EOS visit of the previous study without any adjustments.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including temperature, sitting blood pressure and pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will be 
collected predose at time points according to Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3. Post -dose blood 
pressure and pulse rate will be collected [ADDRESS_115627] 5 minutes. Pulse rate will be measured at the time of 
the measurement of blood pressure.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Physical Examination  
A thorough and complete physical examinati on including height and weight will be performed at 
time points according to Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3.  Care should be taken to examine and 
assess any abnormalities that may be present, as indi cated by [CONTACT_102]’s medical history.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms should be performed before blood is drawn during visits requiring blood 
draws. A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed at time points according to Table  1, Table  2, 
and Table  3. Heart rate will be recorded from the ventricular rate, and the PR, QRS, RR and QT 
(QTcF) intervals will be recorded. The ECG strips or reports will be retained with the source.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tanner Stages  
The Tanner stages will be assessed throughout the study for all patients ≥12 years old and 
<18 years old at specified time points shown in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3.  If possible, for 
each adole scent patient, the Tanner stages assessment should be performed by [CONTACT_31593]/designee trained to assess pubertal development.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory Testing  
All laboratory samples will be collected at visits according to Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3,

Other Laboratory Tests  
Other laboratory tests will be performed at time points shown in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3 
and are as follows:  high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), TSH, FSH, hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c), se x hormones (luteinizing hormone, FSH, estradiol, and total testosterone), and 
pregnancy test (serum and urine).  
Abnormal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adverse Events  
All laboratory values must be reviewed by [CONTACT_31594].  
Significantly, abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment must be repeated to confirm 
the nature and degree of the abnormality.  When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated.  If the abnormality fails to resolve o r cannot be explained by [CONTACT_25037], the Medical/Study Director 
must be consulted.   
The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease under study, 
must be determined by [CONTACT_093].  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section  9.4.5 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Testing  
Women of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy testing approximately every [ADDRESS_115631] at 
the screening visit, end of treatment/early termination visit, a nd end of study visit.  During some 
follow -up visits, and in case of early termination, pregnancy testing will occur at home via a 
urine pregnancy test.  Patients will report results of the home urine pregnancy test to clinical site 
study personnel during follow -up visit or phone visits.  
8.2.3.  Efficacy Procedures  
All laboratory samples will be collected before the dose of study drug is administered.   
Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and smoking or intense physical exercise within 24 hours, 
prior to blood sam pling are discouraged.  
Total cholesterol, calculated LDL -C, TG, and non -HDL -C will be directly measured by [CONTACT_19979].  Low -density lipoprotein cholesterol will be calculated using the Friedewald 
formula.  If TG values exceed 400  mg/dL (4.52 mm ol/L), LDL -C will be measured via the beta 
quantification method (rather than via the Friedewald formula).  If the LDL -C value is less than

High -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) will be measured for assessing non -HDL -C but is 
not an efficacy variable for this study.   
Detailed procedures of sample preparation, storage, and shipment are provided in the laboratory 
manual.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Lipid Panel  
Fasting (at least 8 hours) blood samples will be collected at specified time points shown in 
Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3, for assessme nt of the lipid profile, comprising calculated LDL -C, 
non-HDL -C, HDL, TC, and TGs.  These samples will also be used for specialty lipid panel 
assessment when it is scheduled at the same time as the lipid panel assessment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Specialty Lipid Panel  
Fasting (at least 8 hours) blood samples will be collected at specified time points shown in 
Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3 for assessment of the specialty lipid profile, comprising Apo B, 
ratio of  Apo B/Apo A -1, and lipoprotein a (Lp[a]) as well as for Apo CIII.  Apolipoprotein A -1 
will be measured for assessing ratio of Apo B/Apo A -1 but is not an efficacy variable for this 
study.  The specialty lipid panels will be assessed in the same sample tha t is collected for the 
lipid panel.   
8.2.4.  Drug Concentration and Measurements  
Samples for drug concentration will be collected at visits listed in Table  3.  Any unused samples 
may be used for exploratory biomarker research or other investigations.  
8.2.5.  Anti -Drug Antibody Measurements and Samples  
Samples for ADA assessment will be collected at time points listed in Table  3.  Any unused 
samples collected for ADA assessments may be used for exploratory biomarker research or other 
investigations.

2 dilution steps from the pre -treatment b aseline titer.   
8.2.6.  Ultrasound Imaging  
Carotid ultrasound is a reliable method to measure carotid intima -media thickness (cIMT; in 
mm), which has been shown to be increased in children with HoFH (Kusters, 2014). The 
technique has shown reliable results with a n interobserver coefficient of variation of 7.3% 
(Doyon, 2013).  
8.2.7.  Pharmacodynamic Procedures  
Total ANGPTL3 concentrations in serum will be measured using the PK samples collected at 
time points listed in Table  3.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 72 of 99 8.2.8.  Future Biomedical Research  
Research samples (serum/plasma) will be collected at time points listed in Table  3. The unused 
biomarker samples for study -related research, as well as unused PK and ADA samples, will be 
stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock. The u nused samples may be 
utilized for future biomedical research of HoFH and other diseases. No additional samples will 
be collected for future biomedical research.  After 15 years, any residual samples will be 
destroyed. The results of these future biomedical  research analyses will not be presented in the 
Clinical Study Report.  
8.2.9.  Other Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Review of Diet  
Patients will be asked to follow a heart -healthy diet throughout the duration of the study, starting 
at the baseline visit and continuing through the en d of the open -label treatment period (OLTP), 
until the last study visit.  Patients will be queried on compliance with their diet at time points 
listed in Table  1, Table  2, and Table  3.   
Details are provided in Appendix 1 .   
[IP_ADDRESS].  DNA Sample for HoFH Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
A required blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected to identify or confirm a known 
mutation in PCSK9, LDLR , APOB,  and/or LDLRAP1 gene. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_104212].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Genomics Sub -Study (Optional)  
The genomic sample will be taken for patients who have not been enrolled previously in an 
evinacumab or alirocumab study. Patient s who agree to participate in the genomics sub -study 
will be required to sign a separate genomics sub -study informed consent form (ICF) before 
collection of the samples. Patients are not required to participate in the genomics sub -study in 
order to enroll in the primary study.  Samples for DNA extraction should be collected on day 
1/baseline (predose), but may be collected at any study visit.  
DNA samples for the genomics sub -study will be double -coded as defined by [CONTACT_104243] n (ICH) guideline E15.  Sub -study samples will be stored for up to

to pa tients/subjects, according to local regulations.  This may include death from any cause and 
all SAEs related to the use of the study drug. It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to the 
IRB/EC, according to local regulations.  
9.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]), to the health authorities, IRBs/ECs as appropriate, and to the 
investigators.   
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Reference Safety Information section of the 
Investigator’s Brochure will be considered as unexpected. Any worsening of or new onset of 
symptoms related to HoFH, which oc cur during the screening/washout period prior to study drug 
administration will be considered expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report all other SAEs to the health authorities, according to local 
regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the spons or will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and IRBs/ECs as appropriate.  
9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study  drug, which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious A dverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.

(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria fo r reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  See  Section  9.[ADDRESS_115638] (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
rapid communication by [CONTACT_104244].  Such an event might 
warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  Depending on the nature 
of the event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_50459] (eg, regulators) might also 
be warranted (Secti on 9.4.3 ). 
9.3.4.  Infusion Reactions  
Infusion reactions are defined as any relevant AE that occurs during the infusion or within 
[ADDRESS_115639] be reported as AEs (defined 
in Section  9.4.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the inform ed consent 
is signed until the end of study.  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be 
followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.[ADDRESS_115640] 2022 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_115641] be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_115642] 
reports may also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient c ompletes the study, the 
following will apply:  
• SAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study or within 168 days (24 weeks) 
of last study drug administration if the patient early terminated from the study - the 
SAE will be reported to the sponsor.  Th e investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
• SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termination 
visit - only fatal SAEs and those  deemed by [CONTACT_50460] -related SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 
2 times the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if associated 
with an AE,  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within [ADDRESS_115643] dose of study drug. Any complication of pregnancy affecting a 
female  study patient or female partner of a male study patient, and/or fetus and/or newborn that 
meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. Outcome for all pregnancies should be 
reported to the sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:  All AESI, seri ous and nonserious, must be reported within

All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
Medical/Study Director within [ADDRESS_115649] finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
• the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant dr ug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact [CONTACT_22951]/Study Director in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test 
finding should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence  of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale 
outlined  in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will  be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient normal functioning level.  It 
may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but 
may be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous  to health.  It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite 
hazard to the subject’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/ or patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 78 of 99 If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Infusion Reactions  
The severity of infusion reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of the grade):  
Mild :  Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate :  Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated 
for ≤24 hours.  
Severe :  Prolonged (eg, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14137]/or brief 
interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following  initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31563]; life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; 
death.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (s emi 
colon indicates “or” within description of grade:  
Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of erythema or 
induration that does not interfere with activity.  
Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or interferes 
with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or induration or induration 
that interferes with activity.  
Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily act ivity; 
significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily activity; requires 
ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis.  
9.5.2.  Evaluation of Causality  
Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], and will be a clinical 
decision based on all available information.  The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_104245]:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_104246].

9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will  monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The Medical/Study Director will have primary 
responsibility for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by [CONTACT_31599] (eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biost atistics and Data 
Management).  Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review 
of SAEs) and on a periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the reference 
safety infor mation in the Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal 
relationship to the study drug).

SAP will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
No formal statistical testing will be performed for this open -label study.   
10.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Since this study is an open -label single treatment arm study for patients with HoFH, no 
calculation for sample size was performed.  Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled.   
To gain experience with evinacumab in the subpopulation of adolescent patients, this study will 
plan to e nroll approximately 14 patients in the age range of 12 years to <18 years old. Due to the 
rare patient population planned for evaluation, the sample size of 14 patients was chosen for 
practical reasons, centered on the feasibility to identify and enroll th ese patients into the trial and 
regulatory precedent.  
10.3. Analysis Sets  
10.3.1.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all patients who received at least 1 dose or part of a dose 
of open -label study treatment in this study.  The SAF will be the mai n analysis set for 
exposure/compliance, clinical safety and efficacy.   
10.3.2.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
The SAF will be the main analysis set for efficacy.  
10.3.3.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sets  
The PK population includes all treated patients who received any study drug and  who had at 
least [ADDRESS_115658] 2022 GMT-5:00

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 83 of 99 10.4. Statistical Methods  
In general, data will be presented in 3 patient groups, depending on the status of previous 
evinacumab treatment exposure:  
• Continue evinacumab: patients who received evinacumab in a previous study (eg, 
R1500 -CL-1331 or R1500 -CL-1629);  
• New evinacumab: patients without previous exposure to evinacumab (ie, 
evinacumab -naïve);  
• Total: all patients, regardless of previous (or not) evinacumab exposure.  
These 3 evinacumab exposure groups will be provided for all patients in the r espective patient 
analysis sets. Assuming there are enough patients in the subpopulation of adolescent patients to 
perform the evaluation, the 3 evinacumab treatment exposure groups will be provided again for 
the subpopulation of adolescent patients [yes/n o]. Adolescent patients [yes] are defined as 
ranging in age from 12 years to < 18 years old. Adult patients, defined as ≥ 18 years of age, will 
also be provided.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following information:  the 
number of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), Q1, 
Q3, minimum, and maximum.   
For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each category.  
10.4.1.  Patient Disposition  
The following will be provided by [CONTACT_104253], and 
again for the subpopulation of adolescent patients [yes/no]:  
• The total number of screened patients:  defined as originally having met the inclusion 
criteria and signed the ICF  
• The total number of enrolled patients, defined as all screened patients with a 
treatment kit number allocated and recorded in the IVRS database, regardless of 
whether the treatment kit was used.  
• The total number of patients in each analysis set (Section  10.3) 
• The total number of patients who completed the OLTP (ie, as collected on the end of 
study CRF)  
• The total number of patients who did not complete the OLTP  
• The total number of patients who discontinued open -label study treatment by [CONTACT_104254]  
• The total number of patients who completed the study  
• A listing of patients prematurely discontinued from treatment, alo ng with reasons for 
discontinuation

The percent and absolute change in lipid data (eg, LDL -C, Apo B, TG) will be descriptively 
summarized for each visit by [CONTACT_104256], and again for the subpopulation of adolescent patients [yes/no] for patients 
in the SAF. A within -patient t -test (lipi[INVESTIGATOR_104216] a normal distribution) or Wilcoxon signed -rank 
test (non -parametric test for lipi[INVESTIGATOR_104216] a non -normal distribution such as TG) will be provided 
for secondary efficacy endpoints to descriptively compare each patient’s week 24 assessment to 
their baseline assessment. Missing data will not be imputed.  
The baseline value used for determining percent and absolute change for each  patient is defined as 
follows:   
• For patients who participated in the previous evinacumab study R1500 -CL-1629, 
baseline is defined as the last obtained value before the first dose of double -blind 
study drug in R1500 -CL-1629.  
• For patients who participated in the previous evinacumab study R1500 -CL-[ADDRESS_115660] dose of study drug in R1500 -CL-1719. (Note: Baseline 
for patients who participated in R1 500-CL-[ADDRESS_115661] study treatment in R1500 -CL-1719.)  
10.4.4.  Safety Analyses  
The summary of safety results will be presented in t he SAF as described in Section  10.4.  No 
formal inferential testing will be performed.  Summaries will be descriptive in nature.   
All safety analyse s will be performed using the same baseline definitions described above in 
Section  10.4.3 .

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL   Page 85 of 99 Open -label TEAEs are defined as those events that deve loped, worsened, or became serious 
during the open -label TEAE period.   
Analysis  
All AEs reported in this study will be coded using the currently available version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®).  Coding will be to lowest level terms.  The 
verbatim text, the preferred term (PT), and the primary system organ class (SOC) will be listed.  
Adverse event incidence tables will present data by [CONTACT_31600], and summarize the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients 
experiencing an AE.  Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient  will be counted 
only once in the tables.  Data conventions for missing or partial AE dates will be addressed in the 
SAP.  The denominator for computation of percentages is the respective SAF by [CONTACT_104257], and aga in for the subpopulation of adolescent patients 
[yes/no].   
Summaries of all TEAEs will at least include:  
• All TEAEs (and patient listing)  
• All treatment -emergent SAEs, including patient deaths (and patient listing)

[IP_ADDRESS].  Other Safety  
Definitions  
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters and vital signs:  
• The potentially clinically significant value (PCSV) criteria are defined as abnormal 
value s considered medically important by [CONTACT_31601]/thresholds based on literature review and defined by [CONTACT_31602].  Potentially clinically significant value criteria will be 
provided in the SAP.   
• PCSV criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSV during the 
respective open -label TEAE period, taking into account all evaluations performed 
during this period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of  all 
such patients will be the numerator for the PCSV percentage.   
• Open -label treatment period (OLTP):  The treatment period used for quantitative 
analysis of laboratory and vital signs data in the open -label study period is defined 
from the day after the  first dose of open -label study treatment to the day of the last 
dose of open -label study treatment + [ADDRESS_115663] 2022 GMT-5:00

Summary statistics of raw data and change from baseline in all continuous laboratory variables 
(excluding variables in lipid panel) an d all vital signs parameters will be presented for each 
protocol -scheduled visit assessed during the OLTP period.   
For selected parameters, mean changes from baseline with the corresponding standard error may 
be plotted over time (at same time points).   
Number and percentage of patients with a potentially clinically significant value (PCSV) at any 
time point during the open -label TEAE period will be summarized regardless of the baseline 
level, and again according to the following baseline categories:   
• Normal/missing  
• Abnormal according to PCSV criterion or criteria  
For laboratory parameters for which a PCSV criterion is not defined, similar table(s) using the 
normal range will be provided, regardless of baseline level.   
Listings will be provided with flag s indicating the out of laboratory range values.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment Exposure  
The duration of study drug exposure for the open -label treatment period will be calculated as:   
• Patient duration of study drug exposure in weeks: (last study drug administration date 
+ 28 – first study drug administration date +1) / 7, regardless of unplanned 
intermittent discontinuations  
• The total number of study drug infusions by [CONTACT_4676]  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment Compliance  
Compliance during the OLTP will be assessed by [CONTACT_101849], specifically:   
• Defined for each patient as the average number of days between 2 infusions: (last 
dose date – first dose date) / (number of infusions in OLTP -1), for patients receiving 
at least 2 infusions

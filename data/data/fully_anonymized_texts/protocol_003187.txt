2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Rationale  
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting ~1 million 
Americans with ~60,000 new diagnoses made annually1. Patients with PD suffer debilitating motor 
symptoms affecting all aspects of their ability to function, communicate, and care for themselves3. 
In addition, PD patients can suffer non- motor symptoms including dementia, depression, sleep 
disorders, and a range of autonomic dysfunctions4. Because age is a primary risk factor for PD, 
PD-related morbidity and mortality will surge in the coming decades as Americans live longer5. 
There are no interventions that slow the inexorable progression of PD. Thus, there is a critical 
need to develop novel disease- modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283716].  
A key pathogenic factor in Parkinson’s disease is impaired energy metabolism5.  Several 
observations support this conclusion.  a) Aging, a major risk factor for PD, impairs cerebral 
glucose metabolism, reduces mitochondrial biogenesis, and decreases ATP levels6, 7.  b) 
Glycolysis and mitochondrial function and numbers are decreased in people with PD8-12.  c) 
Mitochondri al toxins (MPTP &  rotenone) induce PD and PD -like phenotypes in cells and animals, 
including humans13.  d) Mutations associated with familial PD ( PI[CONTACT_66150]1, Parkin, DJ -1, CHCHD2, α-
synuclein, LRRK2) disrupt various aspects of mitochondrial  function and/or energy balance14.

Pag
e 6 of 44 We recently discovered that terazosin (TZ) binds and 
activates phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1), the fi rst 
ATP- generating enzyme in glycolysis ( Fig. 1)15.  TZ 
is an α 1-adrenergic  antagonist that is prescribed to 
treat benign prostatic hypertrophy and  rarely  
hypertension16.  However, biochemical and 
functional studies show that TZ has an additional 
target, Pgk1, that is independent of α 1-adrenergic  
antagonism15.  Our earlier crystal structure of Pgk1 
with TZ revealed that the 2,4 -diamino- 6,7-
dimethoxyisoquinazoline motif of TZ binds Pgk1 
adjac ent to the ADP/ATP binding site15.  In earlier 
work and our current unpublished data, we found that TZ increases glycolysis and cellular levels of ATP in cultured cells and in vivo  in mice and rat 
brain
15.  Measurements of brain TZ levels also 
indicate that TZ readily crosses the blood- brain 
barrier .  These findings and the impaired energy 
production in PD, suggested the possibility that TZ 
activation of Pgk1 might improve cellular energy metabolism, prevent progressive cell death, and restore dopamine production and motor function in PD.  Of note,  case reports have identified 
mutations in the PGK1  gene that are associated with early onset PD
17. 
Based on this information, we believe that TZ has the potential to be repurposed for use as the 
first disease modifying treatment of PD.  This would have enormous implications for patients and society.  TZ has the potential to provide a safe and  low-cost treatment option for  patients with PD.  
The information collected in this study will provide vital information to guide future clinical trials of TZ in PD.    
Regardi ng the chosen treatment regimen, oral administration was chosen based on the exi stence 
of Phase [ADDRESS_977994] evaluated the safety of oral TZ in healthy subjects.  The decision to utilize a dose of 5mg daily of TZ was primarily based on information obtained from human data 
(see Section 2.2).  Two separate databases were evaluated (Parkinson’s Progression Markers 
Initiative and Truven) to test the effect of TZ on PD.  In both datasets, TZ was associated with 
improvements in progression and complications of PD. The mean dose of TZ being used by 
[CONTACT_717359] 5mg daily.  Based on results from the Truven 
data, the use of TZ at this dose was not associated with a significantly increased risk of falls or orthostatic hypotension.  TZ can be used at higher doses (up to 20 mg/day) for the treatment of 
benign prostatic hyperplasia and (rarely) hypertension.  However, the antihypertensive action of 
TZ could potentially exacerbate the autonomic instability that can occur in PD
18.  Therefore , 5mg 
daily that was chosen represents a dose that is 1) already FDA approved, 2) is used safely in 
patients with PD, and 3) has been shown to provide benefit for the treatment of PD.  After 
randomization, patients will remain on therapy for 12  weeks  in this  study.   Fig. 1. Aging, genetic mutations & 
predispositions, and environmental 
factors contribute to PD in several 
ways. A common feature is energy 
deficits. Terazosin (TZ) enhances phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) 
activity to decrease energy deficits and 
halt neurodegeneration in models of 
PD.

age 7 of 44 2.2 Supporting Data  
a)Preclinical Data
TZ increases brain ATP levels in vivo.  
We recently discovered that terazosin (TZ) binds and 
enhances PGK1 activity in cell lines, thereby [CONTACT_717360]15.  To test if TZ  increases brain energy production in 
vivo, we administered it to mice.  TZ increased levels of 
pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, increased oxidative phosphorylation, and elevated ATP levels ( Fig. 2a-2c).  Like 
previous in vitro  data, the dose- response was biphasic; at low 
but not high concentrations, TZ may enhance ATP release from PGK1.   
We also asked if TZ would increase energy production in mice 
that received 1-methyl -4-phenyl -1,2,3,6 -tetrahydropyridine 
(MPTP), which is often used to model PD in mice.  Seven 
days after administering MPTP to mice, ATP levels,  pyruvate 
levels ( Fig. 2d,2e), and mitochondrial numbers  fell, consistent 
with impaired energy production.  TZ partially prevented the 
energy deficits, and mitochondrial content was partially maintained.   These data indicate that TZ activates glycolysis 
in vivo .  Together with measurements of brain TZ levels, they 
also indicate that TZ readily crosses the blood- brain barrier.   
TZ enhances PGK1 activity to protect dopamine neurons  
in toxin -induced models of PD.  
MPTP causes PD in  humans19.  We delivered MPTP to mice, 
administered 
TZ for the next 7 days, and then assayed on day 7 ( Fig. 3a).  
Because PD patients present after onset of neuron degeneration, we also asked if delayed TZ 
administration would slow neuron loss and 
functional decline.  Therefore, we also delivered MPTP to mice, waited 7 days, then started 7 days 
of TZ treatment, and assayed on day 14 ( Fig. 3a).  
Over the course of 14 days, MPTP progressively decreased levels of TH protein, dopamine content, 
numbers of TH -positive cells in the substantia nigra 
pars compacta ( SNc), TH staining of their striatum 
projections, and increased apoptosis of the TH -
positive  SNc neurons in vehicle- treated mice ( Fig 
3b).  Initiating TZ treatment when MPTP was 
delivered, attenuated these defects at day 7. Delayed TZ delivery also improved the day 14 
abnormalities.  Accordingly, TZ prevented deficits 
in motor function at day 7 and improved motor 
performance at day 14 after delayed administration 
(Fig. 3c). Fig. 2. TZ increases  striatum 
pyruvate and ATP levels  in vivo .  
Mice were given vehicle or MPTP 
and then TZ once a day for 1 week.  
Data points are individual  mice.

dopamine levels, and improves motor 
peformance in mice given MPTP (a-c) and

We injected 6 -OHDA into the right striatum, waited 2- 5 weeks, and then initiated a two- week
course of TZ ( Fig. 3d).  In vehicle -treated rats, evidence of SNc cell apoptosis prog ressively
increased from 2 to 7 weeks ( Fig. 3e).  However, irrespective of the delay until beginning
treatment, TZ protected against further cell loss.  Correspondingly, dopamine content and TH
reverted toward control values ( Fig. 3f).  Seven weeks after injecting 6 -OHDA into the right
striatum, use of the left forepaw had fallen ( Fig. 3g).  However, when rats received TZ between

We
 also tested the effect of TZ on dopamine neurons differentiated 
from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).  LRRK2G2019S is the 
most common LRRK2  mutation and is associated with ~4% of 
familial and ~1% of sporadic PD27.  Dopamine neurons derived 
from LRRK2G2019S iPSCs recapi[INVESTIGATOR_717337] α-synuclein accumulation28.  We studied such neurons 
generated from two Spanish patients.  After thirty days of Fig. 4. TZ reduces accumulation of α-

Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part 3.Although statistically significant (P=0.039), only

ients with PD used TZ.   To increase the sample
size, we tested related drugs with quinazolinestructures and found that  doxazosin and alfuzosin
increased glycolysis and tyrosine hydroxylase i

MP
TP-treated mice.  In patients using TZ,
doxazosin, or alfuzosin (TZ/DZ/AZ, n=13),
progression of motor disability slowed (P=0.012)
(Fig. 6).  In contrast, the non- quinazoline α1-
adrenergic antagonist tamsulosin did not rescue
tyrosine hydroxylase levels in MPTP -
treated mice and failed to slow motor function decline.  These data also support 
the conclusion that enhanced glycolytic 
activity and attenuation of cell death are 
medi ated by [CONTACT_717362]’s effect on PGK1 and not 
α1-adrenergic receptors.

Watson/Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from 2011 to 2016. The database includes longitudinal, de -Fig. 6. TZ/DZ/AZ  reduced motor function

dentified diagnoses (ICD- 9/ICD -10 codes) and pharmaceutical claims.  We identified 2,880 PD 
patients taking TZ/DZ/AZ and 15,409 taking tamsulosin.  Among 79 PD -related diagnoses,  we 
found a reduced relative risk in 69 codes among patients taking TZ/DZ/AZ vs. tamsulosin.  
Moreover 41 were significantly decreased, whereas only 2 were significantly increased.   To 
estimate PD -related benefits/risks attributable to TZ/DZ/AZ vs. tamsulosin, we calculated the odds 
ratio for each of the 79 PD -related codes.  Relative to PD patients taking tamsulosin, those on  
TZ/DZ/AZ had reduced clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_717338] (odds ratio 0.77 (95% 
CI:0.70 -0.84)), non -motor symptoms (odds ratio 0.78 (95% CI:0.73- 0.83)), and PD complications 
(odds ratio 0.76 (95% CI:0.71 -0.82)) ( Fig. 7).  These data suggest that under real -world 
conditions, TZ and related drugs that enhance PGK1 activity reduced PD signs, symptoms and 
complications.  
R
elationship between PGK1 enhancement and PD. 
PGK1  mutations cause recessive hemolytic anemia, myopathy, seizures, and intellectual  
disability; P arkinsonism has also been reported17, 30.  The authors speculated that reduced ATP 
gene ration in the SNc was responsible.  It may also be worth noting that PD occurs 1.5 times 
more frequently in men than women31, and PGK1  is located on the X- chromosome.  
Fi
nding that TZ increases glycolysis and prevents progressive neurodegeneration supports the 
concept that energy deficits are a critical factor in the pathogenesis of PD5, 14.  The increased ATP 
levels produced by [CONTACT_717365].  ATP has properties of a hydrotrope32, 33.  It can prevent 
aggregate formation and dissolve previously formed protein aggr egates, and the transition 
between aggregate stability and dissolution occurs in a narrow range of  physiological ATP 
concentrations.  We speculate that by [CONTACT_717366], TZ facilitates solubilization of 
aggregates, including α -synuclein,  and prevents the neurodegeneration of PD .  However, other 
mechanisms are possible, including ATP -dependent chaperones (such as HSP90) and 
disaggregases15, 32, 33. 
S
ummary of supporting data.  
It is uncertain which preclinical models of PD will accurately predict therapeutic benefit.  These 
data have the advantage that they identify TZ efficacy in multiple different animal models of PD, 
including toxin- induced and genetic.  Moreover, probing two independent databases suggested 
efficacy in humans with PD.   As a potential PD therapeutic, TZ has the advantages of a defined 
mode of action, blood- brain  barrier penetration, oral availability, and extensive safety experience 
in humans su ggestin g feasibility of l ong-term ad ministration.

per day up to 20 mg/day.  The average daily dose of TZ that participants from the PPMI and Truven databases were using was approximately 5 mg/day.  In both of these databases, TZ was 
associated with beneficial outcomes for patients with PD.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume 
that a dose of 5 mg/day of TZ in patients with PD will provide benefit.  This also represents a dose 
that will minimize antagonism of α -1 receptors that could lead to a decrease in BP, which could 
potentially exacerbate the autonomic instability that can occur in PD
18.   
A
s outlined in Figure 2c, the dose of TZ that produced the optimal results was approximately 1 
microgram/kg to 100 micrograms/kg.  This translates into a dose of 0.001 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg.  If we assume that the average participant will weight approximately 100 kg, a reasonable dose 
would be 0.1 to 10 mg/day.  Figure 2c also demonstrates that the benefits of TZ are still significant 
at higher doses but begin to decrease.  Taken together, our pre -clinical and clinical data suggest 
that the choice of optimal dose would most reasonably be between doses of 1mg, 5mg or 10mg 
daily.  The choice to eliminate a dose of 10 mg/day was based on 1) the increased risk of 
orthostatic hypotension in PD at higher doses and 2) the fact that higher doses may blunt the 
potential benefit of TZ relative to lower doses.  Because the average dose of TZ used in both the 
PPMI and Truven datasets was ~ 5mg/day, and this dose is very reasonable based on the pre-
clinical data, this dose was chosen.

Page 14  of 44 5 STUDY I NTERVENTIONS/STUDY M EDICATION/STUDY DRUG O R DEVICE 
5.1 Study Medications/Interventions, Administration, and Duration 
Once randomized, all participants will receive a one-mo nth titration packet.  For participants 
who 
are randomized to receive TZ, it is important to titrate the dose  slowly  to avoid higher 
incidences of orthostatic hypotension.  All participants will undergo a dummy titration schedule 
to maintain blinding.  The titration schedule is outlined below: 
Placebo TZ 5mg per day  
Week 1 (days 1-7) P A 
Week 2 (days 8-1 4) P + P  A + A  
Week 3 (days 15-21) P + P + P  A + A + A  
Week 4 (days 22-2 8) P + P + P + P  A + A + A + A  
Day 28 and beyond P AA 
P = 1 Placebo Capsule  
A = 1 capsule containing 1mg of TZ 
AA = [ADDRESS_978009] 23 hours. Each treatment will be 
administered by [CONTACT_717370]. Each participant will be maintained 
on their dosage schedule for the duration of the study (3 months).  Dose escalation 
schedules will not be employed.   
5.2 Handling of Study Medications/Interventions 
Study treatment will be compounded and shipped to the University  of Iowa IDS Pharmacy 
by [CONTACT_717371]. All treatment capsules will be compounded to have similar 
appearance, color, taste, and markings between active treatment capsules and placebo 
capsules. The NuCara Pharmacy will be responsible for all regulatory requirements for 
dispensing of treatment, including packaging and labeling requirements. Additionally, 
the NuCara Pharmacy will be responsible for documenting the codes of the treatment 
bottles that are dispensed.

5.3 Concomitant I nterventions 
5.3.1 Requir ed Concomitant M edications/Interventions 
No specific  concomitant medications/interventions  are required for this study.   Participants will 
continue to receive their normal level of care from their providers, and any concomitant 
medications initiated by [CONTACT_717372]’s preferred pharmacy. 
Any time that a new medication is prescribed to a participant, they are to contact [CONTACT_717373].  
5.3.2 Prohibited Medications/Interventions 
Subjects are prohibited from taking doxazosin, alfuzosin, prazosin, terazos in, urapadil,  or 
tamsulosin during  this study.  If  one of these medications is prescribed during the course of the 
study, the participant will be informed that initiation of any of these treatments will result in their 
immediate withdrawal from the study.  They may dec ide if they wish to receive the prescribed 
treatment from their outside provider.  If the subject decides to not initiate the prohibited treatment, 
they may remain in the study.

6.2.1 Screeni
ng/Pre -Randomization Evaluations/procedures 
Individuals identified at each site to potentially  be eligible for inclusion will first be informed about the study and 
asked if they wish to receive more information.  If the subject answers in the affirmative, approved staff will first 
go through the informed consent document with the subject and answer  any questions that the subject may 
have.  Specifically, the participant will be informed that signing this informed consent document does not 
guarantee that they will included in the study.  It simply allows the study sites to perform the necessary screening 
procedures to determine if the participant is eligible for randomization.  If the participant signs the informed 
consent document, the participant will then be screened.  This will include the following assessment s: 
•Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria
•Documentation of  P

If any o
f the above occurs, participants will be asked to come in for an end- of-study visit as soon as possible. 
All assessments outlined in the SoA will be performed at the end -of-study visit.  Participants will not be required 
to continue for future fol low-up appointments after discontinuation of treatment.  Participants who experience 
adverse effects will immediately discontinue study treatment and will not be considered for inclusion in further 
evaluations.  
6.2.4 On Study/Off -Intervention Evaluations  
This tr ial will follow an intention- to-treat design.  Subjects who discontinue study medication (see section 6.2.3) 
will be asked to continue to be followed for the remainder of the study, but will not be taking a study intervention. 
The following assessments will be performed at all on study/off -intervention visits:

An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered r elated to the drug product or device.  FDA  and Office of Human Research 
Protection (OHRP ) requirements for reporting AEs will be followed. Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the 
time they sign consent until 30 days following permanent discontinuation of study drug. At that point, all ongoing 
AEs will be followed to resolution, but no new AEs will be recorded.  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_30496] (co- Investigators, research nurse, clinical trial coordinator) are responsible for 
identifying and reporting AEs and determining the relationship of the event to the study drug/study procedures.

The adverse event (AE) definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply with all applicable 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) guidelines.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_243044]. 
All AEs will be documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  It is important to report all AEs , 
especially those that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product being studied, whether 
serious or non-s erious. 
Receipt will be kept in the investigator’s study file. 
An adverse event is de fined as:  “an unfavorabl e and unintended sign, sy mptom, or di sease associated with a 
subject’s participation i n this r esearch  trial.” 
Serious adverse events  include those events that:  “result in death; are life- threatening; require inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; create persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
a congenital anomaly/birth defects.”  
Unexpected adverse event is de fined a s any a dverse experience…the specificity or se verity o f which is no t 
consistent w ith the risks described i n the protocol.  
Expect ed adverse  events ar e those  that ar e know n to be associated wit h or hav e the potential t o arise  as a

possibly related, probably related, definitely related) of the adverse event. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a Medwatch safety

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event and Suspect ed Adverse Drug Reactions 
An a dverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with a study, use of a drug product 
or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or device.  
Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any 
dose.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product  and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
Therefore, a subset of AEs can be classified as suspected ADRs, if there is a causal relationship to the medicinal 
product.  
Examples of adverse events  include: new conditions, worsening of pre -existing conditions, clinically significant 
abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, peripheral edema, etc), or clinically significant abnormal test 
results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of outcome measure results, which are not being 
recorded as adverse events in this trial (they are being collected, but analyzed separately). Stable chronic 
conditions (i.e., diabetes, arthritis) that are present prior to the start of the study and do not worsen during the 
FAST TZ-P D 
Version 2.0  
Version d ate: 11/12/2019 
trial are NOT considered adverse events. Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent 
conditions) or with greater severity, would be considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as 
adverse events.  
Adv
erse events are generally detected in two ways:  
Clin
ical  symptoms reported by [CONTACT_243075]. 
A
ncillary Tests   abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures (other than the 
outcome measures : the results of which are not being captured as AEs).  
I
f discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual 
associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_246412]. 
However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered 
by [CONTACT_246413] a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a 
separate AE on the AE log.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, 
are those that are identified as such by t he Site Investigator.  
A
n unexpected adverse event is any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the 
current Investigators Brochure or package insert or described in the protocol.  An unexpected, suspected 
adverse drug r eaction is any unexpected adverse event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_246384], 
there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
1.Results in death.
2.Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event occurred.
a.This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the Site Investigator or Sponso r, is at
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs.  It does not apply if an AE hypothetically might have
caused death if it were more severe.
3.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
a.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096] (including elective PEG tube/g -tube/feeding tube placement)
or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by [CONTACT_246414]
“procedure” or a “treatment” is not an untoward medical occurrence.
4.Results in p ersistent or significant disability or incapacity.
a.This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_243077] a substantialdisruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.
5.Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male orfemale).
6.Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or
permanent damage to a body structure.
7.Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243047], based upon appropriate medical judgment, may
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes list

i
n this definition.  Examples of such medical events include blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result
in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243048] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment -emergent, clinical adverse event may 
meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse  experience, and will therefore, not be considered an SAE. 
An example of this would include a social admission (subject admitted for other reasons than medical, e.g., lives 
far from the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has no place to sleep).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment and Recording of Adverse Events  
Assessment of Adverse Events 
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked “Have you had any problems or symptoms 
since your last visit?” in order to determine the occurrence of adverse events. If the subject reports an adverse 
event, the Investigator will determine:  
1.T
ype of event
2.Date of onset and resolution (duration)
3.Severity (mild, moderate, severe)
4.Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE)
5.Causality, relation to investigational product and disease
6.Action taken regarding investigational product
7.Outcome
Relatedness of Adverse Event to Investigational Product  
The relationship of the AE to the investigational product should be specified by [CONTACT_67505], using the following definitions:  
1.Not Related: Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with tr eatment.
2.Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product,and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.
3.Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administrati on of th
e
i
nvestigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the
reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_717377]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_243079]. (suspected ADR)
4.Probably Related:  The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of
investigational product; is confirmed by [CONTACT_246416] -challe nge; and
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state. (suspected ADR)
5.Definitely Related:  The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of
investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational product; and
that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_141507], andreappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. (suspected ADR)
Recording of Adverse Events

The non-Parkinson’s disease medication log provides information about non- PD medications the 
participant/ subject was taking prior to or during the study. Collecting non- PD medications taken 
prior to the study in a defined time window is important when there may be potential interactions 
with th e study intervention. Thus, a potential subject may need to stop a medication prior to 
starting the study intervention (washout period). The study exclusion criteria may identify drugs that cannot be taken during the study and so prior medications are identified to determine whether an individual may be eligible for the study. Important note: None of the data elements included on this CRF Module is classified as Core (i.e., strongly recommended for all Parkinson’s disease clinical studies to collect). All data elements are classified as supplemental (i.e., non Core) and should only be collected if the research team considers them appropriate for their study.

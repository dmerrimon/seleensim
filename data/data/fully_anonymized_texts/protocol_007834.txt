 Amendment 3  Amendment number:  
Rationale/background for changes:  
 
The protocol has been amended to reflect the following changes and provide the 
following clarifications / corrections.  
 
The Bisgaard and Jackson asthma case definitions were adapted so as to integrate 
asthma treatment adv ances while preserving the case definitions’ core intent.  
 
The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) asthma case 
definitions, which facilitate a wider range of international results comparisons, were 
added.  
 
Throughout the docume nt, text has been consolidated and clarified for consistency with 
these changes and to better facilitate uniform, harmonized implementation of the 
protocol. Beginning with Section 2.0, text pertaining to the primary study has been  
shaded in grey  to differe ntiate it from text pertaining to the extension study. Some 
details regarding (a) recruitment into the primary study and (b) primary study visits and 
procedures have been moved from the body of the document to newly created 
Appendices.  
 
Text that has been added or moved appears in boldface italics . A detailed summary of 
changes (including deletions) appears in Appendix G.

 15-DEC -2017  9 SYNOPSIS  
Detailed  Title  A prospective, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], interventional, multi -country 
based, cohort study to assess the disease burden of respi[INVESTIGATOR_14256] (RSV) associated, suspected lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_54582] (LRTIs) in newborns, from birth up to 2 years of 
age and population attributable risk percent of RSV LRTI on  the 
development of wheeze and asthma from birth up to 6 years of 
age. 
Rationale for the 
study (Amended 15 - 
DEC -2017)  This study aims to assess the incidence an d associated 
healthcare utilization of RSV -associated, suspected LRTI 
in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years 
of age, and also to assess the accuracy of a newly 
developed LRTI case definition and severity scale , 
compared to two existing  scales developed by [CONTACT_103210] (WHO) [ Modjarrad, 2016] and 
Nokes , 2008 . 
 
This study will also assess the extent to which RSV LRTI 
in early life (up to 2 years of age) accounts for the total 
burden of wheeze and asthma up to the sixth bi rthday, 
and test the performance of 3 asthma case definitions – 
those of Bisgaard, Jackson and International Study of 
Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC).  
 
The LRTI case definition and severity scale to be used in this 
study has been developed as a consensus model derived from 
existing definitions in the literature, and existing guidelines by 
[CONTACT_35316] ([COMPANY_004]) clinical staff, taking into account the 
advice of a panel of international RSV experts.  
 
Considering asthma case definitions, this study anticipates that 
one (Bisgaard) will be more specific and another (Jackson) 
more sensitive. Although it is likely that the third symptom - 
based case definition (ISAAC ) will be the most sensitive and 
least specific of all three definitions, its incorporation will 
facilitate wider international results comparisons.  
 
If, in future, a maternal and/or pediatric RSV vaccine is 
introduced, results of this study may be used to  evaluate post - 
vaccination incidence reduction (in RSV LRTI and/or wheeze 
and asthma) and the vaccine’s potential public health impact.

Discussion of 
study design 
(Amended 15 - 
DEC -2017)  Surveillance Plan:  
• Surveillance for RSV Lower Respi[INVESTIGATOR_59398]  (RSV 
LRTI), and wheeze during the Primary Study  period.  
• Surve illance for wheeze and asthma during the extension study 
period.  
Safety Follow -up: 
Study Procedure related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) to be 
reported throughout the study.  
The multi -country design of both the primary and extension studies 
will provide ro bust, multinational estimates of the incidence of RSV - 
associated LRTI during the first two years of life and assess the 
amount of wheeze and asthma that may be attributable to those early 
RSV -LRTI infections.  
The Primary study will determine the incidence  and associated 
healthcare utilization of RSV -associated LRTIs in infants from birth 
up to the age of 2 years, and assess the performance of a new LRTI 
case definition and severity scale. Using a cohort representing the 
general population of newborn infant s, the study is designed to 
identify RSV -associated LRTI cases at any severity, and will not be 
limited to those that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or other essential 
medical care. This will provide a comprehensive and accurate measure 
of the overall burden of disease, whereas many previous case -control 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based cohort studies were limited to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333826] -associated  LRTI.  
The association of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_333827] -associated 
LRTI and/or severe LRTI, and the impact of poten tial RSV risk 
factors on the incidence and severity of RSV -associated LRTI will 
also be explored. In order to assess and adjust for other potential 
confounders in the various analyses, data on the subjects’ 
demography and lifestyle factors will be collecte d at baseline, and 
followed up quarterly for changes, during the regular follow -up 
contacts.

Endpoints for 
the Primary 
Study 
(Amended 15 - 
DEC -2017)  At 2nd birthday (on completion of primary study or as soon as possible 
thereafter), surveillance for RSV LRTI will be stopped. Consenting, 
eligible subjects from participating study centers will be enrolled in 
the study extension and followed for the occurrence of wheeze and 
asthma. This will permit an assessment of the proportion of wheeze 
and asthma from birth until the sixth birthday that may be attributable 
to RSV LRTI and RSV infection in the first two years of life. It will 
also test the performance of the different asthma case definitions.  
Target enrollment for the primary study will be 2400 subjects to 
obtain approximately 1920 fully evaluable subjects at primary study 
completion.  
Target enrollment for extension period will be maximum 2400 
subjects (all su bjects participating in the primary study, meeting all 
inclusion and no exclusion criteria for the extension ).

1.1. Background (Amended  15-DEC -2017)  
 
1.1.1.  RSV 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) is an important cause of respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748]. RSV is a 
highly contagious seasonal pathogen that is transmitted from person -to-person via direct 
or close contact [CONTACT_333983], including respi[INVESTIGATOR_333843] 
[Canducci , 2008]. RSV belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is one of the only two 
human pneumoviruses that have been currently recognized (the other being 
metapneumovirus). There are two major gene tic RSV subtypes, A and B. These subtypes 
co-circulate, and the predominance of one over the other varies by [CONTACT_333984] [ Graham , 2011].  
 
RSV is found across the globe with incidences varying between countries and regions 
and even within a country or a region over multiple seasons. In areas of the inner tropi[INVESTIGATOR_333844], RSV seasonality is less clear -cut. Countries close to the 
equator have a distinct pattern of RSV transmission, with most cases appearing in one 
half of the year, but not in the other. But neither temperature nor rainfall appears to be the 
main determinant of the timing of these outbreaks [ Weber , 1998]. Seasonal epi[INVESTIGATOR_333845]. Roughly the RSV season runs from Octob er to March in the temperate areas of 
the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and from May to September in the Southern Hemisphere 
(SH). But the exact timing of RSV circulation varies by [CONTACT_333985] [ Mullins , 2003; Weber , 1998; Law, 2002].  
 
RSV infections result in high rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151382], a large disease burden 
among infants and young children, and excess mortality in the elderly [ Graham , 2011]. 
RSV infects 50 -70% of infants during the first year of life and essentially all children will 
have had an RSV infection by [CONTACT_333986] [ Hall, 2004]. In the early months of 
life, infants may have protection against RSV through the maternal antibodies transferred 
to them during pregnancy. High titers of maternally derived RSV -neutralizing antibodies 
[Roca , 2002] have been shown to be inversely ass ociated with the incidence of RSV 
associated -acute LRTI during the first 6 months of life, whereas incomplete transfer of 
maternally derived RSV -neutralizing antibodies has been implicated in the increased risk 
of severe RSV infection in preterm infants [ de Sierra , 1993]. Previous infection with 
RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Therefore, re -infection with RSV occurs 
throughout an individual’s lifetime and is common in all age groups [ Simoes, 1999; 
Krilov , 2011].  
 
Globally, it is estimated that in children below 5 years of age, RSV causes >30 million 
acute lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073] (LRTI) each year resulting in more than [ADDRESS_412416] common cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333846] [ Nair, 2010]. RSV is the most common 
cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children less than 1 year of age wor ldwide, with

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_412417] risk in children less than 6 months of age [ Nair, 2010; Langley , 2011]. A United 
States (US) based study conducted in children less than 18 years of age, found RSV in 
58% of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333847] 1 -3 in 17%, 
influenza A/B in 21%, adenovirus in 2% and rhinovirus in 2% [ Henrickson , 2004]. On a 
community level, a US day -care based study assessing the causes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348] (RTI) in children less than 1 year of age found that RSV infection was present 
in 11% of the cases, compared to rhinov irus in 35%, adenovirus in 22%, human 
coronavirus in 15%, parainfluenzavirus in 12%, human meta -pneumovirus in 4% and 
influenza A in 2% [ Fairchok , 2010]. This difference between community and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333848], mainly LRTI, compared to other viruses.  
 
Viral co -infections with RSV are also common. Evidence about the severity of co - 
infections compared to single viral infections is co nflicting, as the severity of co -infection 
may depend on the pathogens involved [ Fairchok , 2010]. In a study conducted on dual 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_333849] [ Drews , 1997]. Some examples of viruses which may exist as 
co-pathogens with RSV include, human Metapneumoviruses, human Bocaviruses and 
human Coronaviruses [ Canducci , 2008].  
 
Currently available estimates of RSV disease burden are most often centred on healthcare 
usage, particularly RSV -associat ed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Also, there is no widely supported  
guideline from regulatory authorities or transnational expert bodies on a case definition of 
RSV -associated LRTI in children. As a result, prospective, cohort -based epi[INVESTIGATOR_333850] a consistent case definition for RSV -associated LRTI are rare and there is 
no obvious case definition to be used uniformly as the outcome measure in clinical trials. 
Although the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333851] V disease, variation 
between medical practice policies, quality of the healthcare system and access to 
adequate healthcare can all influence whether a subject with RSV -associated LRTI is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_180247]. Therefore, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333852] a more objective scoring system for the disease severity is needed. Several 
studies have attempted to develop a severity score or a model, but this has not lead to a 
validated model, accepted as the universal gold standar d [Nokes , 2008].  
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated its RSV -associated LRTI 
case definition [ Modjarrad , 2016]. The latter includes clinical features considered to be 
objec tive, easily standardized, generalizable across settings, and generally accepted 
markers of severe or very severe RSV disease.  
 
1.1.2.  Asthma  
 
Infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_333853] e 
and chronic diseases of childhood, respectively. Common clinical features and links 
between these diseases have long been recognized, with early -life RSV LRTIs being 
strongly associated with increased asthma risk.

 15-DEC -2017  31 Although asthma is probably a heterogeneous disease or syndrome, three factors 
and/or events consistently emerge for their ability to significantly influence asthma 
inception in the first decade of life: immune response aberrations, which appear to be 
defined best by [CONTACT_333987]; LRTIs, in particular RSV; and 
some form of gene –environment interaction that needs to occur at a critical time - 
period in the development of the immune system or the lung [ Leman ske, 2002].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by [CONTACT_14581] - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the cumulative 
incidence of LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year of life and 
approximately 9 to 17% in the second year of life. Among infants with LRTI, the 
prevalence o f RSV can be as high as 80%, especially in the first 3 months of life. Thus, 
the phenotype of asthma after infant RSV LRTI accounts for up to 31% of early 
childhood asthma, with a population -attributable risk estimated at about 13% in 
several diverse popul ations [ Feldman , 2015].  
 
Numerous longitudinal studies have demonstrated this first important line of evidence 
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also 
demonstrate a dose –response re lationship between infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_333854], with increasing infant infection severity associated with 
greater childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [ Feldman , 2015].  
 
The Childhood Origi ns of Asthma (COAST) study was developed to determine and 
define the importance of these three factors on asthma pathogenesis and to test 
different asthma case classifications [ Lemanske , 2002; Lema nske , 2005; Bisgaard , 
2011; Jackson , 2008; Jackson , 2012; Bønnelykke , 2015]. These studies have used 
similar albeit slightly diff erent case definitions on asthma diagnosis. The International 
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) takes a slightly different parent - 
based questionnaire approach toward assessing asthma prevalence in young children.  
 
These definitions are wi dely used in epi[INVESTIGATOR_333855]. The Bisgaard definition [ Bisgaard , 2011] has multiple criteria that are 
assessed by [CONTACT_333988]. Therefore the advantage of this definitio n is 
that the same objective criteria are applied to ascertain each case of asthma. However, 
its application may be challenging in some settings if routine medical records do not 
fully capture the necessary information in source. The Jackson definition [ Jackson , 
2008] includes the criteria of health care provider (HCP) diagnosis of asthma and 
prescription of [ADDRESS_412418], 
primarily symptom -based questions that are administered solely to the parents.  
ISAAC’s strength is that its definitions are not af fected by [CONTACT_333989]; however, its lack of clinical case confirmation may decrease its 
precision. The ISAAC questionnaire has been used to assess pediatric asthma 
prevalence in at least 42 countries across the globe [ Pearce , 2007].

 15-DEC -2017  32 1.2. Rationale for the study (Amended  15-DEC -2017)  
This study aims to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization of RSV - 
associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of 
age, and a lso to assess the accuracy of a newly developed LRTI case definition and 
severity scale , compared to two existing scales developed by [CONTACT_333990] (WHO) [ Modjarrad , 2016 ] and [ Nokes , 2008 ]. 
This study will also assess the extent to which RSV LRTI in early life (up to 2 years of 
age) accounts for the total burden of wheeze and asthma up to the sixth bi rthday, and 
test the performance of 3 asthma case definitions – those of Bisgaard, Jackson, and  
ISAAC.  
The LRTI case definition and severity scale to be used in this study has been developed 
as a cons ensus model derived from existing definitions in the literature, and existing 
guidelines by [CONTACT_35316] ([COMPANY_004]) clinical staff, taking into account the advice of a 
panel of international RSV experts.  
Considering asthma case definitions, this study antici pates that Bisgaard will be more 
specific and Jackson more sensitive. Although it is likely that the ISAAC symptom - 
based case definitions will be the most sensitive and least specific of all three 
definitions [ Yang , 2011], its incorporation will facilitate wider international results 
comparisons. Hence, this study will assess the performance of the different case 
definitions since this will help planning for phase 3 clinical trials of RSV vaccines.  
If, in future, a maternal and/or pediatric RSV vaccine is introduced, results of this 
study may be used to evaluate post -vaccination incidence reduction (in RSV LRTI 
and/or wheeze and asthma) and the vaccine’s potential public health impact.

3.2.2.  Extension Study  
 
At 2nd birthday (on completion of primary study or as soon as possible thereafter), 
surveillance for RSV LRTI will be stopped. Consenting, eligible subjects from 
participating study centers will be enrolled in the study e xtension and followed for the 
occurrence of wheeze and asthma (applying 3 different asthma case definitions). This 
will permit an assessment of the proportion of wheeze and asthma from birth until the 
sixth birthday that may be attributable to RSV LRTI and  RSV infection in the first two 
years of life. It will also test the performance of the different asthma case definitions 
(Table 5 ). 
 
4. CASE DEFINITIONS (AMENDED  15-DEC -2017)  
 The Primary study will determine the incide nce and associated healthcare utilization of 
RSV -associated LRTIs in infants from birth up to the age of 2 years, and assess the 
performance of a new LRTI case definition and severity scale. Using a cohort 
representing the general population of newborn inf ants, the study is designed to identify 
RSV -associated LRTI cases at any severity, and will not be limited to those that require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or other essential medical care. This will provide a comprehensive 
and accurate measure of the overall burd en of disease, whereas many previous case - 
control or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based cohort studies were limited to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333860] - 
associated LRTI.  
The association of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_333827] -associated LRTI and/or severe  
LRTI, and the impact of potential RSV risk factors on the incidence and severity of RSV - 
associated LRTI will also be explored. In order to assess and adjust for other potential 
confounders in the var ious analyses, data on the subjects’ demography and lifestyle 
factors will be collected at baseline, and followed up quarterly for changes, during the 
regular follow -up contacts.  Primary Study  3.2.1.

Suspected involvement of the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_333861] a child with clinical signs of RTI, 
defined as either a runny nose, blocked nose or cough, is believed to have difficulties in 
breathing in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]/study staff, based on the sy mptoms reported 
by [CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s) during the surveillance phone contacts. Difficulty in breathing as 
suspected by [CONTACT_093]/study staff through reported symptoms will then be 
objectively confirmed by [CONTACT_093]/study staff by [CONTACT_333994]. If at least one of these parameters is outside of the pre -defined 
normal range (Refer to Table 3 ), the case will be considered as an LRTI for the 
surveillance part of the study.  
 
A subject is considered to have difficulty in breathing if he/she shows signs of:

During the surveillance for LRTI, any potential LRTI that is not found to meet the criteria 
for an LRTI may need a subsequent objective assessment by [CONTACT_093]/study staff.  
 
Note: The investigator/study staff will do an initial assessment of a case reported for the 
examination visit as either RTI or LRTI, only to determine further study activities. The 
final classification of all the cases reported as either, RTI, LRTI or seve re LRTI will be 
done during statistical analyses as per the definitions given below.

LRTI or severe LRTI according to the LRTI case definition and severity scale described 
in Table 4 , and also accor ding to the classification of WHO and the classification used by

6.5. Detailed description of study procedures for the Primary 
Study period (from birth up to 2 years of  age) 
 
6.5.1.  Informed consent  
 
The signed/witnessed/thumb printed informed consent of the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) 
must be obtained before study par ticipation. Refer to Section 6.1 for the requirements on 
how to obtain informed consent.  
 
• In case of anticipated twins (or other multiple births ), an ICF needs to be signed  for 
each expected child before the start of  delivery.  
• In case of unexpected twins (or other multiple births ), only the children for whom an 
ICF has been signed before birth can be enrolled. This should occur as per the birth 
order.  
 
6.5.2.  Check inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable before  birth  
 
Check all applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable before birth as described 
in Sections 5.3.[ADDRESS_412439] numbers will be assigned sequentially to subjects whose parent(s)/LAR(s) have 
consented for their child participation in the study, according to the range of subject  
numbers allocated to each study center.  
 
• In case of anticipated twins (or other multiple births ), a subject number will be 
assigned sequentially to each child for whom the consent has been obtained, a s per 
the birth order, where the first born will be associated with the lowest subject 
number, the second born with the successive subject number,  etc. 
After obtaining the ICF and confirming eligibility, the subject needs to be entered in to 
the SBIR scree ning module. SBIR will control the recruitment rate as per an allocated 
target.  
 
6.5.4.  Collection of expected birth  date 
 
Record the expected delivery date as required in the subject’s eCRF.  
 
6.5.5.  Collection of cord blood sample  
 
Refer to the Module on Biospecimen Management in the SPM for general handling of 
blood samples.  
 
A volume of up to approximately [ADDRESS_412440] blood sample will be collected 
from all subjects at birth, which should yield up to approximately 3 mL of serum. In case

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_412441] blood samples collected will provide RS V- antibody levels in the child, at birth.  
 
6.5.6.  Check inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable after birth  and 
re-sign-off the  ICF 
 
Check all applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable after birth as 
described in Sections 5.3.1  and 5.4.1  before enrollment.  
 
The informed consent should be updated with relevant personal identifiers as applicable 
by [CONTACT_5277]. The ICF should be re -signed off by [CONTACT_093]/study staff and 
subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and witness (when required) not later than [ADDRESS_412442] 
as required by [CONTACT_51084], by [CONTACT_334006](s)/LAR(s) and/or reviewing the medical  
records and record data collected in the subject’s eCRF. This includes family history of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], living environment and household composition, breastfeeding, 
passive smok ing and day -care attendance.  
 
6.5.8.  Collection of data on child at birth and  delivery  
 
Information about the delivery and the newborn (including medical care provided 
immediately after birth and planned to be provided subsequently) should be collected 
from the parents/LAR and completed and/or confirmed from an original source accessed 
through a person involved in the delivery of the subject or from any authorized person 
representing the healthcare organization that is i n charge of the source and the collected 
data should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
 
6.5.9.  Registration in  SBIR -enrollment  
 
After obtaining the updated ICF and confirming eligibility, the subject needs to be 
entere d in to the SBIR enrollment module. SBIR will randomize the subject to a time 
point for blood sample collection if the subject is part of the sub -cohort the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) should be informed about this allocation.

utilization  
 
The investigator/study staff will provide diary cards to the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) as 
needed to record relevant symptoms and healthcare system utilization during the course 
of the case. The diary card provided needs to be filled by [CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s) only in 
case the investigator/study staff concludes tha t their child has developed an RTI with 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_333875], leading to an examination visit (off -site/site) during the 
study follow -up period.  
 
6.5.11.  Blood sampling  
 
Refer to the Module on Biospecimen Ma nagement in the SPM for general handling of 
blood samples.  
 
A volume of approximately 3.5 mL of whole blood sample will be collected from a sub - 
cohort of subjects at randomly allocated time points to obtain approximately 1 mL of 
serum.  
 
Selected subjects will be randomized to the time point 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 or 24 months at 
which a single blood sample should be collected from them. The sample should be 
collected between the intervals of  1 week e.g. Month 2  1 week, Month 4  1 week in 
order for the subjec ts to be included in the analyses. Subjects born at a gestational age of 
less than 36 weeks will be excluded from this blood sampling. Randomization will be 
done using a second phase application of SBIR.  
 
Blood samples collected will be used to assess RSV antibody levels in the subjects.  
 
6.5.12.  Ascertain RTI symptoms and potential difficulty in breathing and 
assessment of need for examination visit  (off-site/site)  
 
During each active or passive follow -up contact, the investigator/study staff should 
confirm with the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject, if the subject developed new RTI 
symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose), and any signs of difficulty in breathing 
(during  and between contacts). In case there is any current sign or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_333876] a child with symptom(s) of RTI at the time of the contact, the 
investigator/study staff should instruct the parent(s)/LAR(s) to start completing the diary 
card and schedule an examination visit (off -site/site) as soon as possible, but no later than 
[ADDRESS_412444], whether or not it 
triggers an examination visit, will be recorded in the site’s  source documentation and in 
the eCRF. Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_334007], or if the 
child who did not have signs of difficulty breathing  develops the symptom.

The active and passive surveillance contacts can also be made with person designated by  
[CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s) (e.g. grandparents, nanny) as long as the parent(s)/LAR(s) have 
approved the same. If need ed, a field worker can also be assigned to support the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) and/or person designated by [CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s) in completing the 
diary card.  
 
The investigator/study staff should also collect any further identifying data (e.g. official 
name, socia l security number) that becomes available for a subject during the course of 
the study at regular surveillance contacts, and record it in a supporting site document.  
 
6.5.13.  Recording of data on changes to baseline medical and 
demographic data  
 
On a quarterly basis, the investigator/study staff should expand a regular surveillance 
contact [CONTACT_334008]/LARs for changes to the baseline medical, demographic 
and lifestyle  characteristics data collected at Visit 2. This includes at least;  
 
• diagnosis of chronic  diseases  
• medical events requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• vaccinations received (on disease level, not full vaccination  details)  
• start/stop attendance of day -care and other c hanges in daily  care 
• start/stop  breastfeeding  
• changes to household composition and/or living conditions 
This data will be recorded in a quarterly surveillance  eCRF.  
 
6.5.14.  Examination during (off -site/site) visit and collection of all 
disease  symptoms  
 
The examination visit can be an on -site or off -site visit. An off -site visit is preferred in 
order to avoid influencing the pattern of healthcare utilization for the disease.  
Parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects can however be requested to bring their child to the 
study center for the site examination visit e.g. if this would be the normal standard of  care 
to provide given the situation, if this will significantly expedite the timi ng of the visit, or 
if it is unlikely that the off -site examination visit can occur at all within the required 
timeframe. If the reported symptoms are already of a level of severity that urgent care is 
indicated, the parent(s)/LAR(s) should be redirected t o the proper location to receive this 
care (e.g. ER) and an examination visit could be scheduled to take place there at a 
suitable time. During the examination visit (off -site/site), the investigator/study staff 
should objectively confirm the RTI and diffi culty breathing experienced by [CONTACT_334009]. Data should be 
collected on all the clinical symptoms present in the child including a measurement of the 
temperature, RR and pulse oximetry. The  data collected should be recorded in the 
subject’s  eCRF.

(off-site/site), and as subsequently assessed from the diary card, and/or confirmed 
with any healthcare provider involved, during course of the  disease.  
• RR as assessed by [CONTACT_1697]/study staff during the examination visit (off -site/site), 
and as subsequently assessed by [CONTACT_334010], during disease  
course.  
• Healthcare utilization during disease course as assessed from the diary car d and/or 
confirmed with any healthcare provider  involved.  
Note:  
 
Healthcare utilization (or healthcare setting availed) refers to self -care with OTC drugs, 
GP visits, ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], etc.  
 
Data from healthcare providers (such as temperature, RR , SaO2, symptoms and 
diagnosis) is to be regarded as a valuable, but optional extra, if this data is available and

6.5.16.  Collection of nasal swab  samples  
 
• Nasal  sampling:  Cells  and secretions  from  the nose will be collected  by [CONTACT_334014] (off -site/site) 
(this includes subjects with no confirmed  LRTI).  
Full details for obtaining nasal swabs are  provided in the Module on Biospecimen 
Management in the SPM accompanying this protocol.  
 
6.5.17.  Return Diary card at completion or at case  resolution  
 
The diary card will be collected at completion.  
 
• Regular completion is after the standard diary card duration of 14  days.  
• If a surveillance case eCRF is ‘closed’ due to a subsequent examination visit for the 
same case, the diary card relating to the ‘closed’ eCRF is stopped prematurely and  a 
new [ADDRESS_412445] is started (see also Section 3-examination  visit).  
If the subject is not free of the symptoms asked for in the diary card at the end of Day 14, 
the parent(s)/LAR(s) should continue to assess the symptoms until no mor e symptoms are 
present, and record in the diary card, the date at which no more symptoms were observed 
in the child.  
 
6.5.18.  Confirmation and expansion of data on healthcare utilization 
occurring after the examination v isit (off -site/site) and  collection 
of any further, relevant data on disease course with HCPs 
involved in subject care  
 
Data on disease course recorded by [CONTACT_423]’s parent(s)/LAR(s) in the diary card until

• Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research. In addition, these 
sample s may be used to perform research related to the improvement, development 
and quality assurance of the laboratory tests described in this protocol. This may 
include the management of the quality of these tests, the maintenance or 
improvement of these tests , the development of new test methods, as well as making 
sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods and work  reliably.  
• It is also possible that future findings may make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study for future research,  not described in this protocol. Therefore,  
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be invited to give another specific 
consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contracted partner use the samples for future research 
including development of tests and their quality assurance. Future research will be 
subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and will only be 
performed once an independent Ethics Committee or Revie w Board has approved 
this research.  
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals.  
 
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s).  
 
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform any other biological assays except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s).  
 
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 years ( counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study contact), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines 
require different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the 
subject consent. These extra requirements need to  be communicated formally to and 
discussed and agreed with [COMPANY_004] Biologicals.  
 
6.7.1.  Use of specified study  materials  
 
When materials are p rovided by [CONTACT_43055], it is MANDATORY that all samples 
(including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those materials in 
the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the exclusion of the 
subject from the Acc ording -To-Protocol (ATP) analysis (See Section 9.4 for the 
definition of study cohorts/data sets to be analysed). The investigator must ensure that 
his/her personnel and the laboratory(ies) under his/her supervision comply wi th this 
requirement. However, when [COMPANY_004] Biologicals does not provide material for collecting 
and storing samples, appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_412451] medical occurrence that:  
 
a. Results in death,  
b. Is life-threatening,  
NB: The term ‘life -threatening’  in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333881],  
NB: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333882]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an ou t-patient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12262]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42979], the event 
will also be considered serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838]’ 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an SAE.  
d. Results in  disability/incapacity,  
NB: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncompli cated headache, nausea,  
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333883]. These should also be considered serious.  
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an ER 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

definition of an SAE (refer to Section 7.1.1 ). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory  
findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantly 
worsen following the start of the study will also be reported as SAEs. However, clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_334022]’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start 
of the study and do not worsen, will not be re ported as SAEs.  
 
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
 
7.2. Detecting and recording  SAEs  
 
7.2.1.  Time periods for detecting and recording  SAEs  
 
SAEs related to study participation will be collected and recorded from the time of the 
first study visit until the subject is discharged from the study.  
 
In order to fulfil international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study 
participation (i.e., protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing 
therapy) will be collected and recorded from the time when the subject parent(s)/ LAR(s) 
have consented their child’s/children’s participation in the study until she/he is 
discharg ed from the study.  
 
7.2.2.  Evaluation of  SAEs  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Active questioning to detect  SAEs  
 
Each subject’ s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_334023] (s) they perceive as serious.  
 
All SAEs either observed by [CONTACT_15009]/ her staff or reported by [CONTACT_423]’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) spontaneously or in response to a direct question will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_093]. The nature of each event, date and time of onset, outcome, intensity and 
possible relationship to the study procedures should be established.  
 
When an SAE  occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding the SAE 
in the  eCRF. The investigator is not allowed to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals instead of appropriately completing the eCRF. However,

signs, symptoms, and/ or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should 
be documented as the SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of  causality  
 
The investigator should assess the causality of each SAE. The investigator will use 
clinical judgement to determine the relationship between the SAEs and study  
participation. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, other 
concomitant therapy and other risk factors will be considered and investigated.  
 
There may be situations when a SAE has occurred an d the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However it is very 
important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to submission of the SAE report to [COMPANY_004] Biologic als. The investigator may change 
his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and update the SAE 
information accordingly.  
 
If an event meets the criteria to be considered as ‘serious’ (see section 7.1.1 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by [CONTACT_334024].  
 
Possibly contributing factors include:  
 
• Medical  history.  
• Concomitant medication.  
• Protocol required  procedure.  
• Other proc edure not required by [CONTACT_93865].  
• Other cause  (specify).

8.2. Subject  withdrawal  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study because of study procedure related SAEs 
must be clearly distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons.  
Investigators will follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study as the result of a  
study procedure related SAE until resolution of the event (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Withdrawals will not be replaced.  
From an analysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study refers to any su bject who 
was not available for the concluding contact [CONTACT_91313].  
 
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact [CONTACT_334030].  
 
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’  from the study when no study procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.  
 
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the  eCRF. The investigator

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_412464] calculated from 1000 simulations and for different 
hypothesis  Table 14  Each simulation consists of creating ‘ c’ clusters whose size and inc idence vary around a 
given value. Then the above formula was applied to estimate the design effect in the 
simulation. Table 14 shows the median result of 1000 simulations (with 5th and 95th 
percentile). The design effect [ Bennett , 1991] can be estimated as following once the 
intra-cluster correlation value is known or can be assumed:  
DE = 1 + (b – 1) ρ 
 
Where, ρ is the intra -cluster correlation and b is the average number of subjects sampled 
per cluster. According to the results of simulations, we could assume that the intra -cluster 
correlation of 0.02 (See Table 14 below) and considering [ADDRESS_412465] will take a value of 4.18 . Where, ‘ c’ is the number of clusters, ‘x i’, and ‘y i’ are number of children -years and 
number of cases, respectively in the ‘ith’ cluster, ‘ n’ is the total number of children -years 
and ‘ p’ is the overall proportion ‘ ∑ yi/∑xi’.

Few active studies reported the overall RSV -associated LRTI incidence rates (with or 
without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). According to the results observed in a birth cohort conducted in 
Kenya [ Nokes , 2008] we expect tha t the RSV -associated LRTI rate will be 8 times 
greater than the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103103].  
 
As the subjects may dropout from the study due to a variety of reasons, e.g. migration 
from the study area, the sample size has been increased to accommodate the same.  
Assuming a drop -out rate of about 20% during the course of follow -up approximately 
400 subjects by [CONTACT_1606]/region and 2400 subjects overall will need to be recruited.

Data transformations and derived variables will be described in the SAP. However, 
they may include the following:  
 
• Age of the subject at time of th e LRTI case will be expressed in months and will be 
computed as the difference between the start date of the LRTI case and the date of 
birth.  
• Age of the subject at time of blood sample collection will be expressed in months 
and will be computed as the difference between the sample collection date and the 
date of  birth.  
• Age of the mother at the time of childbirth will be expressed in years and wi ll be 
computed as the difference between the birth date of the subject and the birth date of 
the mother.  
• Duration of the study for each subject will be computed as the difference between 
the date of last contact (i.e., active or passive surveillance contac t or the date of the 
censoring) and the date of enrollment (date when ICF was first signed by [CONTACT_1560]’s  parent[s]/LAR[s]).  
 
• All potential LRTI cases identified during the surveillance period will be classified 
as RTI, LRTI or severe LRTI according to t he LRTI case definition and severity 
scale (refer to Section 4). The cases will also be classified according to the 
classification of WHO and by [CONTACT_333995] [Modjarrad , 2016; Nokes , 2004]. First 
time, the classification will be done at visit level, i.e. according to the data collected 
at the initial visit and, if applicable, at each additional examination visit. Finally, a 
classification at case level will be done co nsidering the most severe classification 
from all visits.  
 
9.5.1.  General considerations for statistical  analyses  
 
The primary analyses will at least be performed on the PPS cohort or sub -cohort. If more 
than 5% of the subjects are eliminated from the total enrolled cohort, then all analyses 
may also be performed on the total enrolled cohort in addition to the PPS cohort or sub - 
cohort.  
 
When mentioned below in the upcoming an alyses sections, analysis by [CONTACT_334034]:  
 
• Age categories  
• Hemisphere/Region/Country  
• Birth on -season or  off-season  
• Collection time of swabs (72 hours/48 hours from the start date of the case (date  of 
the call), 72 hours/48 hours from the reported onset of  symptoms).

For each of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398], incidence rates will be calculated as the number of 
LRTI/severe LRTI cases associated with the virus over the number of children -years 
observations.  
 
• To explore the association of RSV viral load with the incidence of RSV - 
associated RTI, LRTI and/or severe LRTI (as determined by [CONTACT_334044]).  
Descriptive analyses (mean, median, min, max) of viral load assessed by [CONTACT_334045]- 
qPCR of RSV RTI, RSV LRTI and severe LRTI cases will be tabulated.  
 
• To explore the impact of changes to the symptoms and threshold levels of 
symptoms in the LRTI case definition and severity  scale.  
Frequency tables will summarize the proportion of RSV -associated LRTI/ severe LRTI 
cases associated with a list of symptoms and clinical parameters, overall and by [CONTACT_56816].  
 
This will help us to determine potential areas of improvement of the LRTI case definition 
and severity scale. Incidence rates of RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI will be 
calculated for any proposal of modification of the LRTI case definition and severity 
scale.  
 
• To explore the impact of variations in cord -blood sample collection variables on 
the stability of test  results.  
The measure d maternal antibody levels will be assessed versus variability in sample 
collection variables. This involves assessment versus various continuous and categorical 
variables and an overall comparison between samples as classified ‘according to 
recommended pr ocedure’ and ‘not according to recommended procedure’.

[IP_ADDRESS].  To determine the population attributable risk of wheeze and asthma 
from birth to sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in the first two 
years of  life. 
 
The incidence rate of medically attended wheeze, wheeze or asthma requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517], and prescription of medications for wheeze or asthma may be calculated 
and stratified by [CONTACT_1606].  
 
The population attributable risk may be calculated by [CONTACT_334049].  
 
Details will be provided in the SAP. An example follows.  
 
The population attributable risk of medica lly attended wheeze may be calculated as:  • To assess the natural decay of maternal antibody levels using a single follow -up 
blood sample collected from a randomly selected sub -cohort of subjects at 2, 4, 
6, 12, 18 and 24 months.  
The primary analysis will be based on ATP sub -cohort for this objective.  
 
The decay of maternal antibody levels over time will be analysed graphically and by a 
log-linear regression. A true, natural decay curve will be explored by [CONTACT_334050]. The following steps will be taken to 
identify, confirmed and suspected infected subjects to eliminate these from the sample;  
 
• Subjects with an RSV positive nasal swab during the study before time of sampling 
will be  eliminated.  
• A sensitivity analysis of the decay curve will be explored in sub -sample c onsisting of 
the subjects born ‘off -season’ as these have the lowest likelihood of having been 
infected.  
• Subjects with an antibody titer at the sampling time that is more than 2 -fold above 
the expected value based on their baseline (cord blood) value and t he established 
decay curve will be considered to have been infected, eliminated and the decay  curve 
refined.  
• Step [ADDRESS_412466] accurate decay curve is  established.

risk calculations involving recurrent outcomes).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  To determine the population attributable risk percent of wheeze and 
asthma from birth until sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in the 
first two years of  life. 
 
The population attributable risk percent together with 95% CI of medically attended 
wheeze, wheeze or asthma requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], and prescription of medications 
for wheeze and asthma may be calculated overall and by [CONTACT_125916] (0 -2 years, 2 -4 yea rs 
and 5 -6 years), respectively.  
 
The population attributable risk percent may be calculated by [CONTACT_334051] a nd who 
did not have RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life.  
 
For example, the population attributable risk percent of medically attended wheeze may 
be calculated as:

[IP_ADDRESS].  To explore the performance of asthma case  definitions.  
 
The number and percentage of children with diagnosis of asthma (case definition s 1, 2, 
and 3 will be described for each applicable age; the number and percentage of children 
with recurrent wheeze at each applicable age will be described overall and by [CONTACT_334054].  
 
The risk of asthma at the age of 6 years using case definitions 1, 2 and 3 (occurring from 
2nd to the 6th birthday) will be analyzed using multivaria ble logistic regression model  
including RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life and other potential risk factors 
listed above, respectively.  
 
• Statistical analysis of agreement will be performed to compare asthma case 
definitions 1, 2, and 3 to each  other.  
• Cohen’s kappa (or othe r appropriate) coefficient may be used for the comparisons . 
The magnitude of the kappa coefficient represents the proportion of agreement 
greater than that expected by  [CONTACT_3364].  
 
9.9. Interpretation of  analyses  
All analyses will be descriptive with the aim to characterise overall occurrences, patterns  
and potential differences between groups in the endpoints related to the objectives.  
The tertiary objective ‘To expl ore the impact of changes to the symptoms and threshold 
levels of symptoms in the LRTI case definition and severity scale’ will be assessed if we 
detect potential areas of improvement of the LRTI case definition and severity scale, such 
as clearly under or  overestimated incidence rates of LRTI/ severe LRTI compared to the 
rates in the literature or a lack of discriminative power between severe and non -severe 
cases. This decision will not be taken on specific pre -defined thresholds.  
 
9.10.  Conduct of analyses  
Analytic plans may be modified as appropriate to accommodate final sample sizes and 
data distributions. Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan 
outlined in this protocol will be described and justified in the final study report.

Neutralization assay  
 
The Serum Neutralization assay is a functional assay that measures the ability of serum 
antibodies to neutralise the cytopathic effects of RSV (for example, strains A and B) on 
the host cell line, hence RSV replication. In the first s tep of the assay, a specific quantity 
of a replication capable RSV virus and a defined dilution of serum are mixed and 
incubated. Each serum dilution is tested in duplicates. During the second step, the virus - 
serum reaction mixture is transferred on the h ost cells and only non -neutralized virus is 
able to infect and replicate in the host cells. This leads to the formation of a given number 
of plaque forming units (PFU) on the cell monolayer that can be detected using a 
fluorochrome -tagged anti -RSV antibody . The neutralising titer is determined by 
[CONTACT_334060] a 60% inhibition in PFUs compared to a cell 
monolayer infected with virus alone, without serum.  
 
RT-qPCR assay  
 
Briefly, RSV A and RSV B ribonucleic acids (RNAs) extracted fr om the nasal swabs are 
detected in a duplex PCR format using specific amplification primers and fluorescent 
probes designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid protein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to comple mentary 
deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) by [CONTACT_334061] - time PCR 
reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is reported 
as copi[INVESTIGATOR_333915].  
 
xTAG™ RVP Fast assay  
 
xTAG™ RVP  Fast assay is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex tests intended for the 
simultaneous detection and identification of multiple respi[INVESTIGATOR_333916]/nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals suspected of respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]. A 
multiplexed PCR reaction is performed to amplify the regions of interest in the target 
human or infectious agent genes. The PCR reaction is treated to remove excess 
nucleotides and primers. The PCR reaction is then subjected to a primer extension step 
that is  specific for the allele or the infectious agent that is being analyzed: Allele Specific 
Primer Extension (ASPE) or Target Specific Primer Extension (TSPE). The 5’ end of the 
ASPE or TSPE primers is attached to an xTAG universal tag sequence. The 5’ univer sal 
tag sequence is hybridized to the complementary anti -tag sequence coupled to a particular 
xMAP bead set. The hybridized beads are read by [CONTACT_334062].

 15-DEC -2017  92 APPENDIX  C OVERVIEW OF RECRUITMENT PLAN (PRIMARY 
STUDY) (AMENDED 15 -DEC -2017)  
• Subjects  will be pre -selected to be enrolled in the study, by [CONTACT_334063](s)/LAR(s) during pregnancy, after 20 weeks of gestation 
and before the start of delivery, to include their child in the study at birth. On 
obtaining the co nsent, the subjects will be checked for inclusion and exclusion 
criteria applicable before birth. A pre -selected child not meeting the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be considered a screening  failure.  
• On receiving consent, subject numbers will be assigned sequentially to each 
subject, according to the range of subject numbers allocated to each study  center.  
• After birth, the final inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked and the 
informed consent will be updated with, time and date of birth and any other 
potentially relevant identifiers as applicable by [CONTACT_334064] -signed. 
Any pre -selected subject not meeting the eligibility criteria will be considered a 
screening  failure.  
• Subject recruitment is intended to occur over a period 18 months or until the 
planned target enrollment has been met. Assuming no delays in recruitment, two - 
thirds of the subjects (1600) will be recruited in Year [ADDRESS_412483] of th e subjects (800) in the first half of Year [ADDRESS_412484] of the subjects will be absorbed by a 
shorter follow -up period for these subjects, unless the decision is taken after the 
interim analysis to extend the study to allow all subjects to complete 2 years of 
follow -up. 
• The recruitment will be performed using a first application of SBIR where  subjects 
will be entered on obtaining ICF and recruitment is controlled on the monthly 
recruitment rate. The aim is to attain a reasonably stable n umber of subjects per 
month over the full recruitment period in order to achieve an equal spread in the 
age of subjects at first exposure to an RSV season. Recruitment will be actively 
controlled through the SBIR system on country level according to agreed  targets, 
actual recruitment rates, and further recruitment potential, so as to achieve a 
sufficient population on a regional level. With concurrent recruitment across the 
globe (with different seasonality) and an intended, steady recruitment over 18 
month s, the following population is to be  included;  
 Subjec ts from NH during first 6  months  
 Subjects from SH during first 6  months  
 Subjects from NH during second 6  months  
 Subjects from SH during second 6  months  
 Subjects from NH during third 6 months; repeat of first 6 months  NH

PRIMAR Y STUDY VISITS (AMENDED  15-DEC - 
2017)  
 
 
 
 
 • Eligibility criteria applicable before birth will be assessed. A pre -selected child who 
does not meet the eligibility criteria will be considered a screening  failure.  
• The expected delivery date will be collected as required by [CONTACT_334065].  
• After obtaining the ICF and confirming eligibility, the subject needs to be entered 
into the randomization syste m on internet (SBIR) screening module. SBIR will 
control the recruitment rate as per an allocated  target.  
• The study site will contact [CONTACT_334066].  
Visit 2 (enrollment visit commencing a t birth):  
 
• During this visit, and before any study follow -up procedures are performed (no 
later than [ADDRESS_412486]), the informed consent will be 
updated with relevant personal identifiers as applicable by [CONTACT_334067]-signed by [CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s), investigator and witness (when required). The 
investigator/study staff should also collect any further identifying data (e.g. official 
name, social security num ber) that becomes available for a subject during the 
course of the study, at regular surveillance contacts and record it in a supporting 
document.   In case of anticipated twins (or other multiple births), an ICF needs to be 
signed for each expected child before the start of delivery. A subject number 
will be assigned sequentially to each child as per the birth order, where the 
first born will be assoc iated with the lowest subject number, the second born 
with the successive subject number,  etc. 
 In case of unexpected twins (or other multiple births), only the children for 
whom an ICF was signed and subject number was assigned before birth can 
be enrolled . This should again occur as per the birth  order.  Study visit schedule related to the primary study (from birth up to the age of 2 years):  
Visit 1 (screening visit):  
• Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_093]/study staff for each subject 
from the parent(s) /LAR(s) of the subjects during pregnancy, after at least 20 weeks 
of gestation and before the start of delivery, to include their child in the study, at 
birth.  
• On obtaining the consent, one subject number will be assigned to each unborn 
child and recorded in the ICF and the copy of the ICF will be provided to the 
parent(s)/LAR(s). A sequential allocation of subject numbers will be assigned 
according to the range of subject numbers allocated to each study  center.

• A baseline cord blood sample of up to approximately 10 mL will be collected at 
birth from all live born infants recruited at Visit 1 in the  study.  
• Eligibility of the infants for the study wi ll be confirmed as per the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria that can be assessed only after birth. If the subject is found to be 
ineligible during this assessment, the cord blood sample that was collected will be 
discarded and the subject will be considere d a screening failure. Eligibility 
(including the updated ICF) needs to be definitively confirmed not later than [ADDRESS_412487] will automatically become a screening 
failure. Eligibility also needs to be definitively confirme d before any other study 
procedure is performed.  
Refer to section 5.3 and 5.3.2  for details on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
• After obtaining the updated ICF and confirming eligibility, th e subject needs to  be 
entered in to the SBIR enrollment module. SBIR will randomize the subject to a 
time point for blood sample collection. If the subject is part of the sub -cohort, 
parent(s)/LAR(s) should be informed about this  allocation.  
• Information about the delivery and the newborn (including medical care provided 
immediately after birth and planned to be provided subsequently) will be collected 
by [CONTACT_334068]/LAR, and if possible, completed and/or 
confirmed with an o riginal source accessed through a person involved in the 
delivery of the subject or from any authorized person representing the healthcare 
organization that is in charge of the  source.  
• The parent(s)/LAR(s) will be interviewed to obtain information on the f amily 
medical history and demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the subject as 
required by [CONTACT_334065].  
• Parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects will be instructed when to contact [CONTACT_1275]/study staff and will be provided with diary cards to record sym ptoms 
and healthcare utilization over the course of the disease when instructed to do so 
by [CONTACT_093]/study staff. For details refer to ‘surveillance contacts (active 
and passive surveillance)’  below.  
Visit 3 (blood sample collection):  
 
• This visit will be applicable only for a sub -cohort of subjects. At the time point 
randomly allocated to each subject selected for a blood draw (2, 4, 6, 12, 18 or 24 
months), an off -site or site visit needs to be scheduled and a single follow -up blood 
sample of 3.5 mL should be collected from the subjects between the intervals of  1 
week, to be included in the analyses e.g. Month 2  1 week, Month 4  1 week. For 
details refer to Table 1 . Children who are born with a gestatio nal age of less than 
36 weeks will be excluded from this  sub-cohort.

(PRIMARY STUDY) (AMENDED  15-DEC -2017)  
Surveillance contacts (ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE)  
 
In order to optimize the reporting procedures of suspected LRTI cases and to ensure 
that the maximum number of cases are timely identified and reported to the study sites, 
both active and passive surveillance will be conducted.  
 
• Passive surveillance by ‘self ’-report of symptoms by [CONTACT_7078](s)/LAR(s) of the 
subjects is key for timely identification of a potential LRTI case. Parent(s)/LAR(s) 
need to contact [CONTACT_093]/study staff as soon as the child experiences new 
RTI symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose), irrespective of the appearance 
of signs of difficulty in breathing, which will be determined by [CONTACT_1275]/study staff on  contact.  
• For the active surveillance, parent(s)/LAR(s) of all the subjects will be contact[CONTACT_103230]/study st aff on a regular basis (active follow -up schedule will  be 
confirmed based on the local settings and seasonality) to identify any potential 
LRTI case and to remind the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects to report any new 
sign of RTI symptoms (cough, runny nos e, blocked nose) as soon as possible 
themselves.  
Note: A child experiencing RTI symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose) with any 
signs of difficulty in breathing will be considered a potential LRTI case.  
 
During each active or passive follow -up contact,  the investigator/study staff will:  
 
• Confirm with the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject, if the subject developed new RTI 
symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose) and if he/she has developed any  signs 
of difficulty in breathing (during and between contacts ). 
 
  In case there is any current sign or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_333917] a 
child with symptom(s) of RTI at the time of the contact, the investigator/study 
staff will instruct the parent(s)/LAR(s) to start completing the diary card and 
will schedule an examination visit as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_412489] an optimal biological sample for the detection of  RSV.  
The examination visit can be an on -site or off -site visit. An off -site visit is 
preferred in order to avoid influencing the pattern of healthcare 
utilization for the disease. Parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects can however 
be requested to bring their child to the study center for the site 
examin ation visit e.g. if this would be the normal standard of care to 
provide given the situation, if this will significantly expedite the timing of 
the visit, or if it is unlikely that the off -site examination visit can occur at

all within the required timeframe. If the reported symptoms are already of 
a level of severity that urgent care is indicated, the parent(s)/LAR(s) 
should be redirected to the proper locatio n to receive this care (e.g.  
Emergency Room [ER]) and an examination visit could be scheduled to 
take place there at a suitable time.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• If during the contact, the investigator/study staff schedules an examination visit 
(off-site/site), the parent(s)/LAR(s) are instructed to start completion of the diary 
card.  Parent(s)/LAR(s) need to fill the diary card until Day 14 from the day the 
investigator/study staff have instructed them to initiate the diary card, unless the 
investigator/study staff informs them otherwise (e.g. in case of a second 
examination visit). I f the symptoms last for more than 14 days the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) should continue to assess the symptoms until no more symptoms 
are present, and record in the diary card, the date at which no more symptoms 
were observed in the child.  
• For any reported illness, the investigator/study staff should assess the need for any 
intervention and provide the same as part of regular healthcare or instruct/advise 
the parent(s)/LAR(s) where to obtain this care.  
• The active and passive surveillance con tacts and completion of diary card can also 
be made by/with person designated by [CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s) (e.g. grandparents, 
nanny) as long as the parent(s)/LAR(s) have approved the same. If needed, a field 
worker can also be assigned to support the parent(s) /LAR(s) and/or person 
designated by [CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s) in completing the diary card.  
• On a quarterly basis, an active surveillance contact [CONTACT_334069], lifestyle and general medical 
characteristics of the subject as required by [CONTACT_334065].  
Refer to phone script provided along with the protocol for details.

• A case eCRF needs to be created for each scheduled examination visit and data 
collected up to case resolution will b e entered. Examination visits will be allocated 
with a unique visit number that is a sequential number per  subject.

Note: The investigator/study staff will do an initial assessment of a case reported for 
the examination visit as either RTI or LRTI, only to determine further study activities. 
The final classification of all the cases repor ted as either RTI, LRTI or severe LRTI 
will be done during statistical analyses (as per the LRTI case definition and severity 
scale and comparative scales).  
 
• Nasal swabs will be collected for all the subjects who are reported for an 
examination visit (off -site/site) (this includes subjects with no confirmed  LRTI).  
• Data on disease course and healthcare utilization recorded by [CONTACT_423]’s

examination visit, the status and evolution of the case will be followed, and 
parent(s)/LAR(s) will be reminded to complete the diary card for the ful l period or 
until case resolution, if after. Data provided by [CONTACT_7071](s)/LAR(s) in the diary 
card on healthcare utilization should ideally be confirmed by [CONTACT_334073]/study staff with the healthcare providers involved in managemen t of 
the case (e.g. General Practitioner [GP], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]) and recorded in the eCRF.

• A new diary ca rd and case eCRF will be initiated for each scheduled examination 
visit. Any ongoing eCRF for that case from previous examination visits will be 
closed and further data recorded in the new case eCRF. If a surveillance case 
eCRF is ‘closed’ due to a subsequ ent examination visit for the same case, the diary 
card relating to the ‘closed’ eCRF is stopped prematurely and a new [ADDRESS_412491] is started (see also Section 3-examination  visit).

Active surveillance is to occur at a defined frequency dependent on the known RSV 
seasonality.  
 
• RSV has a typi[INVESTIGATOR_333919]/monsoon seasonality. The peak rates of RSV occur at 
different times on the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. The tropi[INVESTIGATOR_333920].  
 
For this reason, an active surveillance schedule will usually be applied based on the 
known or expected RSV seasonality for each study country/site.  
 
• [ADDRESS_412492] in all the  regions.  
• At least 4 seasonal contacts – An intermediate contact [CONTACT_334077]/expected 
peak months, depending on the RSV seasons in the country/site. More 
intermediate contacts may be scheduled if dee med necessary by [CONTACT_11168].  
 
Outside the scheduled active surveillance contacts, each country/site can employ 
additional activities to enforce active and passive surveillance at their discretion. These 
activities can be tailored to best meet the loc al situation (e.g. reminders, community 
consultation sessions, additional in -person subject support visits, etc.).  
 
TIMING AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTACT  
 
• Active surveillance contacts are scheduled compared to the calendar week (Sat - 
Sun) of enrollment into the study. So regardless of the day of birth, the first 
Sunday after birth is Week 1 in the surveillance  schedule.  
 
• Seasonal contacts can occur anytime during the season they are scheduled to 
occur. A minimum of three attempts, occurring on at least two di fferent working 
days should be  made.  
 
• Monthly contacts should occur in the first two weeks of the calendar month. A 
minimum of six attempts, occurring on at least four different working days  spread 
over two subsequent weeks should be made to make contact f or monthly 
surveillance  contacts.  
 
DISCONTINUATION OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE  
 
All reasonable efforts should be made to conduct all active surveillance contacts in line 
with the schedule mentioned above. However, subjects’  parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject 
may not be available for active surveillance for a period of time.   At least one live (e.g., telephone or in -person) contact [CONTACT_334078].  
 An adequate response is obtained on non -live contact (e.g. return text message 
or return email). Any non -live contact [CONTACT_334079] a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_412493].

 • During active contacts, investigator/study staff should request the parent(s)/LAR(s) 
of the subject if they will unavailable for a scheduled period (e.g. due to holiday). 
If so, the active surveillance contacts can then be actively planned differently or 
cancelled compared to the regular schedule. No more than 2 consecutive active 
surveillance contacts and/or a period of more than 1 month can be  cancelled.  
 
• Active surveillance should be suspended after there has been no contact [CONTACT_334080] 3 planned contacts and/or no contact [CONTACT_334081] 2 months and a final 
attempt has been made by [CONTACT_262909] a live visit. If the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject 
contact [CONTACT_093]/study staff at a later point in time through passive 
surveillance, t he case should be followed up, data should be collected at 
intermittent period and active surveillance could be  reinitiated.

Protocol Amendment 1  
eTrack study number and  Abbreviated  Title  200150 (EPI -RSV -005 BOD)  
Amendment  number:  1 
Amen dment date:  27 November 2013  
Co-ordinating  author:  [COMPANY_003] , Scientific  writer  
Rationale/background for changes:  
In order to reduce study complexity and manage the global study budget the study 
design has been amended as follows.  
 
• The sample size has been reduced from 3,000 subjects to 2,400 subjects to balance 
recruitment of approximately 400 subjects in each geographic/climatic area. 
Reducing the sample size will affect the precision of the estimates obtained, but 
will be sufficie nt to meet the study objectives with a sample size of 2,400  subjects.  
• The maximum number of active surveillance contacts has been fixed to [ADDRESS_412494] cases of 
LRTI. To balance the  risk of missing cases of LRTI, the study sites will also 
perform passive surveillance. The study procedure manual will outline passive 
surveillance methods that could be implemented in country settings e.g. social 
media applications in developed countries  versus regular (weekly) person -to- 
person community visits in less developed  countries.  
• In addition, some minor editorial changes have been  made.  
Amended text has been included in bold italics and deleted text in strikethrough  in 
the following sections:

simulation [Bennett, 1991]  
 
Each simulation consists of creating ‘ c’ clusters whose size and incidence vary around a 
given value. Then the above formula was applied to estimate the design effect in the 
simulation . Table 11 shows the median result of 1000 simulations (with 5th and 95th 
percentile). The design effect [Bennett, 1991] can be estimated as following once the 
intra -cluster correlation value is known or can be assumed:  
 
DE = 1 + (b – 1) ρ 
 
Where, ρ is the intra -cluster correlation and b is the average number of subjects 
sampled per cluster. According to the results of simulations, we could assume that the 
intra -cluster correlation of 0.02 (See Table 11 below) and considering [ADDRESS_412510] will take a value of 4.18between 2.57  
and 9.49. A median value of 5.13 was used for the CIs described in Table 9 . 
 
Assuming a drop -out rate of about 20% during the course of follow -up approximately 
6400 subjects by [CONTACT_1606]/region and 3000 2400 subjects overall will need to be r ecruited.  
Section 9.3.3 ATP cohort:  
The ATP cohort will include all subjects meeting all eligibility criteria up to the time of 
their censoring, either at study completion or prematurely as drop -out (e.g. withdrawn 
consent, los st-to-follow -up, lack of comp liance).  
Section 9.8 Analysis of tertiary objectives:  
• To explore the impact of variations in cord -blood sample collection variables on the 
stability of test results.  
 
The measured maternal antibody levels will be assessed versus variability in sample 
collection variables. This involves assessment versus various continuous and 
categorical variables and an overall comparison between samples as classified 
‘according to recommended procedure’ and ‘not according to recommended 
procedure’.  
 
The measured mate rnal antibody levels by [CONTACT_334046] -linear regression.  
 
The measured maternal antibody levels by [CONTACT_334087] (mean, 95% CI). Group means will be 
compared by t -test to assess the statistical significance of differences.  
 
The measured maternal antibody levels in samples collected ‘according to 
recommended procedure’ and ‘not according to recommended p rocedure’ will be 
analysed graphically and by [CONTACT_334048] (mean, 95% CI). Group means will be 
compared by t -test to assess the statistical significance of any difference.

The second  tertiary objective ‘To explore the impact of changes to the symptoms and 
threshold levels of symptoms in the LRTI case definition and severity scale’ will be 
assessed if we detect potential areas of improvement of the LRTI case definition and 
severity scale, such as clearly under or overestimated incidence rates of LRTI/ severe

severe and non -severe cases.

Infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_333924], respectively. Common clinical features and links 
between these diseases have long been recognized, with early -life respi[INVESTIGATOR_151495] (RSV) lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014] (LRTIs) being strongly associated with 
increased asthma risk with no direct link to causality.  
 
World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated its RSV -associated LRTI case 
definition. The latter includes c linical features considered to be objective, easily 
standardized, generalizable across settings, and generally accepted markers of severe or 
very severe RSV disease.  
 
Although asthma is probably a heterogeneous disease or syndrome, three factors and/or 
events consistently emerge for their ability to significantly influence asthma inception 
in the first decade of life: immune response aberrations, which appear to be defined 
best by [CONTACT_333987]; LRTIs, in particular RSV; and some 
form of gene –environment interaction that needs to occur at a critical time -period in the 
development of the immune system or the lung [Lemanske,  2002].

Protocol Amendment 3 Final  
The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study was developed to determine and 
define the importance of these three factors on asthma pathogenesis and to test different 
asthma case classificat ions [Lemanske, 2002, Lemanske, 2005, Bisgaard, 2011, 
Jackson, 2008, Jackson, 2012, Bønnelykke, 2015]. These studies have used similar 
albeit slightly different case definitions on asthma diagnosis. These definitions are 
widely used in epi[INVESTIGATOR_333925]. The Bisgaard 
definition [Bisgaard, 2011] has multiple criteria that are assessed by [CONTACT_334091]. Therefore the advantage of this definition is that the same objective criteria are 
applied to ascertain e ach case of asthma. However, its application may be challenging 
in some settings if routine medical records do not fully capture the necessary 
information in source. The Jackson definition [Jackson, 2008] includes the criteria of 
HCP diagnosis of asthma an d prescription of [ADDRESS_412514] important line of evidence 
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also 
demonstrate a dose –response relationship between infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_333854], with increas ing infant infection severity associated with 
greater childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [Feldman, 2015].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by [CONTACT_14581] - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the prevalence 
of LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year of life and approximately 9 to 
17% in the second year of life.  
 
Among infants with LRTI, the prevalence of RSV can be as high as 80%, especially in 
the first 3 months of lif e. Thus, the phenotype of asthma after infant RSV LRTI 
accounts for up to 31% of early childhood asthma, with a population -attributable risk 
estimated at about 13% in several diverse populations [Feldman, 2015].  
 
This cohort study provides us an opportunity to evaluate a potential association and the 
disease burden in the population due to RSV LRTI (exposure) early in life and the 
development of recurrent wheeze and asthma later in life (outcome). Derived 
calculati ons of incidence of recurrent wheeze and asthma among RSV LRTI positive 
and negative subjects and the calculation of population attributable risk percent will be 
able to potentially demonstrate a measurement of potential public health impact if a 
successfu l maternal and/or pediatric vaccine introduced and exposure (RSV) 
eliminated/reduced.

• All subjects enrolled in the study will now be followed up from 2 years of age  up 
to 6 years of age to capture epi[INVESTIGATOR_333926].  
• Additional secondary and tertiary objectives are being included in order to support 
exploratory analysis of the extent the early life experience of RSV LRTI is 
accounting for the total burden of wheeze and asthma from birth up to 6 years of 
age. 
• To perform an exploratory analysis and test of asthma case definitions and  case 
classification performance based on well defined and commonly used case 
definitions from epi[INVESTIGATOR_101322].  
• To update LRTI case definitions and severity scale (according to WHO, 2015 
[Modjarrad,  2016]).  
• Information from this study will now be used to infer the potential benefit in terms 
of disease burden reduction and health care utilization of successful 
implementation of vaccination against RSV and measurement of potential public 
health impact and poten tial incidence reduction if a maternal and/or pediatric 
vaccine introduced and exposure (RSV) eliminated.  
• Overall, the new objectives aim to support the fact that successful maternal and 
paediatric  vaccines  that would  be introduced  would  provide  protection  through  the 
first two years of life against RSV LRTI and thus would reduce the burden of 
recurrent wheeze and asthma associated RSV from birth until the sixth  birthday.

 15-DEC -2017  119 Synopsis and section 3  Study design  overview:  
 
In the primary study subjects were to be followed -up from birth up to the age of [ADDRESS_412519] epi[INVESTIGATOR_333858].*  
 
*Note: The procedures related to primary study (surveillance of RSV LRTI) will not be 
extended into the extension period. The extension period will survey for occurrenc e of 
wheeze and asthma. Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary 
study (documented at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were 
recorded during the examination visits, see Section 9.8).  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_333929] s tudies have some limitations. It is possible that study dropouts 
might occur leading to differential lost to follow up and bias study. Moreover, it is 
possible that a selection bias might occur. Factors pertaining to enrollment of subjects 
into this prospe ctive cohort study would not introduce selection bias. In order to 
introduce bias, selection has to be related to both exposure and outcome. But in this 
study, subjects are enrolled in prospective cohort before they experience the outcome of 
interest.  
 
Another potential limitation of this study is the occurrence of confounding especially 
with potential risk factors. A possible alternative would be to match within a cohort 
study. But this can reduce the efficiency of a cohort study even when there is no 
samp le-size reduction and even when the matching variable is a confounder.  
Furthermore, albeit cohort matching prevents confounding by [CONTACT_334094], it 
is not considered an advantage of matched designs since in an unmatched study 
confounding by [CONTACT_334095]. Hence, in order 
to deal with the confounding factors stratification analysis will be used for each 
confounder. Multivariate logistic regression will also be used to adjust to confounders 
after selection from th e univariate logistic regression. All possible confounding factors 
such as gender, geographic ancestry, pets, parental smoking and previous maternal or 
siblings history of asthma will be analyzed first in stratification and then in logistic 
regression (uni variate and multivariate).

• The parent(s)/LAR(s) will be interviewed to obtain information on potential risk 
factors for wheeze and asthma, and on dat a about wheeze and asthma. The 
investigator will supplement information from parents with review of routine 
medical records /consultation with routine health care  provider.  
• In addition, the investigator will on annual basis assess whether a child meets the  
protocol  defined  criteria  of asthma  based  on information  of parents  and review  of 
routine medical records /consultation with routine health care  provider.

Synopsis and  section  3.1 Discussion of the study  design  
 
The association of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_333827] -associated LRTI and/or severe 
LRTI, and the impact of potential RSV  risk factors on the incidence and severity of RSV - 
associated LRTI will also be explored. The influence of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_333934] - 
infections will be assessed by [CONTACT_334099].  In order to assess and adjust for other potential 
confounders in the various analyses, data on the subjects’ demography and lifestyle 
factors will be collected at baseline, and followed up quarterly for changes, during the 
regular follow -up contacts.  
 
The subjects enrolled in the primary study will be followed up for epi[INVESTIGATOR_333935] 0 to 2 years of age. At 2nd birthday (on completion of primary study or as 
soon as possible thereafter), the surveillance for RSV LRTI will be stopp ed and the 
subjects will be re -consented for study extension during which they will be followed up 
for the occurrence of wheeze and asthma. Thus, this study also helps to assess how 
much of wheeze and asthma and its healthcare utilization from birth until the sixth 
birthday can be attributable to RSV clinical LRTI and RSV infection in the first two 
years of life. Any information pertaining to a gap period between completion of 
primary study and consent to the extension will be captured retrospectively by 
[CONTACT_334100], discussion with health care provider and parental 
interview.  
*Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary study (documented 
at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were recorded during the 
examination visits, see Section 9.8).  
 
This cohort provides us an opportunity and information to evaluate a potential 
association between RSV LRTI (exposure) early in life and the development of 
recurrent wheeze and asthma later in life (outcome). In o ther words, this study will 
assess to what extent this early life experience of RSV LRTI is accounting for the total 
burden of wheeze and asthma from birth until sixth birthday. Moreover, this study will 
also test the performance of asthma case definition.  This study will be able to 
potentially demonstrate a measurement of potential public health impact and potential

Appendix A  LABORATORY  ASSAYS  
 
The Serum Neutralization assay is a functional assay that measures the ability of serum 
antibodies to neutralise the cytopathic effects of RSV ( for example, strains A and B) on 
the host cell line, hence RSV replication. In the first step of the assay, a specific quantity 
of a replication capable RSV virus and a defined dilution of serum are mixed and 
incubated. Each serum dilution is tested in dup licates or triplicates.  
 
RT-qPCR assay  
 
Briefly, RSV A and RSV B ribonucleic acids (RNAs) extracted from the nasal swabs 
are detected in a duplex PCR format using specific amplification primers and 
fluorescent probes designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid 
protein. The process involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to 
complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) by [CONTACT_334118] - time PC R reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV 
viral load is reported as copi[INVESTIGATOR_333946].  
 
Based on genetic and antigenic variations in the structural proteins, RSV is classified in  
two subgroups, A and B. In order  to identify and quantify RSV -A and RSV -B nucleic  
acids in various respi[INVESTIGATOR_153194], such as nasal and throat swab samples, a single - 
step quantitative RT -qPCR assay has been developed. Two sets of primers’ pairs and  
probe have been designed in the N gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein: one targeting  
RSV -A and the other targeting RSV -B. 
 
Viral RNA from 200 µL of the clinical sample is extracted using the MagNA Pure LC 
Instrument and MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit. Purified RNA is  
eluted in a final volume of 50 µL. RNA from the clinical sample is amplified and  
detected using the specific primers and probes for RSV -A and RSV -B RNA with the help  
of ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System 96 -Well Bloc k Module (Applied  
Biosystems). Viral load values are quantified and the sample is considered positive when  
the measured viral load is equal to or above the assay cut -off. Several controls are  
included at the extraction step to monitor the efficiency of the  extraction and the potential  
contamination during the extraction run. In addition, RT -qPCR positive controls  
corresponding to a standard curve obtained by [CONTACT_241670] a mix of RSV -A and RSV -B 
synthetic RNA from 106 to 102 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/RT -qPCR are added to the R T-qPCR step.  Two

Section  1.1 Background  
 
1.1.1 RSV  
This study aims to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization of RSV - 
associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of  
age, and also to assess the accu racy of a newly developed LRTI case definition and  
severity scale compared to two existing scales developed by [CONTACT_78464]  
(WHO) and Nokes et al. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated 
its RSV -associated LRTI case definition  [Modjarrad, 2016]. The latter includes clinical 
features considered to be objective, easily standardized, generalizable across settings, 
and generally accepted markers of severe or very severe RSV disease.  
 
1.1.2 Asthma  
 
The LRTI case definition and severity sc ale has been developed as a consensus model  
derived from existing definitions in the literature, and existing guidelines by

 15-DEC -2017  144 GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) clinical staff, taking into account the advice of a panel of  
intern ational RSV experts. Suspected cases of LRTI will be classified into RTI, LRTI or  
severe LRTI based on the data collected in the study, according to the newly developed  
LRTI case definition and severity scale. The presence of RSV in potential LRTI cases  
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_940] (PCR) on nasal swabs. Following the  
confirmation of RSV, the performance of LRTI case definition and severity scale will be  
determined based on the resulting incidence of LRTI and severe LRTI and their  
associati on with healthcare utilization. Full symptom data over the course of the disease  
for all suspected LRTI cases will be collected before positive identification of RSV by  
[CONTACT_334120]. With this symptom data, the LRTI case definition and severity scale  
will be further explored to determine the clinical symptoms which better describe an  
LRTI and severe LRTI case and the LRTI case definition and severity scale will be  
updated if this improves its performance.  
 
Infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_333948], respectively. Common clinical features and links 
between these diseases have long been recognized, with early -life RSV LRTIs being 
strongly  associated with increased asthma risk.  
 
World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated its RSV -associated LRTI case  
definition [Modjarrad, 2016]. The latter includes clinical features considered to be  
objective, easily standardized, generalizable ac ross settings, and generally accepted  
markers of severe or very severe RSV disease.  
 
Although asthma is probably a heterogeneous disease or syndrome, three factors 
and/or events consistently emerge for their ability to significantly influence asthma 
incept ion in the first decade of life: immune response aberrations, which appear to be 
defined best by [CONTACT_333987]; LRTIs, in particular RSV; and 
some form of gene –environment interaction that needs to occur at a critical time - 
period i n the development of the immune system or the lung [Lemanske, 2002].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by [CONTACT_14581] - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the 
prevalence  cumulative inc idence of LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year 
of life and approximately 9 to 17% in the second year of life. Among infants with 
LRTI, the prevalence of RSV can be as high as 80%, especially in the first 3 months of 
life. Thus, the phenotype o f asthma after infant RSV LRTI accounts for up to 31% of 
early childhood asthma, with a population -attributable risk estimated at about 13% in 
several diverse populations [Feldman, 2015].  
 
Numerous longitudinal studies have demonstrated this first importan t line of evidence 
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also 
demonstrate a dose –response relationship between infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_333854], with increasing infant infection severity a ssociated with 
greater childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [Feldman, 2015].  
 
The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study was developed to determine and

 15-DEC -2017  145 2011; Jackson, 2008; Jackson, 2012; Bønnelykke, 2015]. These studies have used 
similar albeit slightly different case defi nitions on asthma diagnosis. The International 
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) takes a slightly different parent - 
based questionnaire approach toward assessing asthma prevalence in young children.  
 
These definitions are widely used in e pi[INVESTIGATOR_333855]. The Bisgaard definition [Bisgaard, 2011] has multiple criteria that are 
assessed by [CONTACT_333988]. Therefore the advantage of this definition is 
that the same objective criteria are app lied to ascertain each case of asthma. However, 
its application may be challenging in some settings if routine medical records do not 
fully capture the necessary information in source. The Jackson definition [Jackson, 
2008] includes the criteria of health care provider (HCP) diagnosis of asthma and 
prescription  of [ADDRESS_412551], primarily symptom -based 
questions that are administered solely to the parents. ISAAC’s strength is that its 
definitions are not affected by [CONTACT_334121]; 
however,  its lack of clinical case confirmation may decrease its precision. The ISAAC 
questionnaire has been used to assess pediatric asthma prevalence in at least 42 
countries across the globe [Pearce,  2007].  
Numerous longitudinal studies have demonstrated this f irst important line of evidence  
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also  
demonstrate a dose –response relationship between infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_333949], with increasing infant infecti on severity associated with greater  
childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [Feldman, 2015].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by [CONTACT_14581] - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the  prevalence of  
LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year of life and approximately 9 to 17% in  
the second year of life. Among infants with LRTI, the prevalence of RSV can be as high  
as 80%, especially in the first 3 months of life. Thus, the phenot ype of asthma after infant  
RSV LRTI accounts for up to 31% of early childhood asthma, with a population - 
attributable risk estimated at about 13% in several diverse populations [Feldman, 2015].  
 
Section 1.2 and Synopsis Rationale for the Study:  
 
Paragraphs 1 and 2:  
 
This study aims to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization of RSV - 
associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of 
age, and also to assess the accuracy of a newly developed L RTI case definition and 
severity scale compared to two existing scales developed by [CONTACT_67848] (WHO) [Modjarrad, 2016] and Nokes , 2008 .

 15-DEC -2017  146 This study will also assess the extent to which RSV LRTI in e arly life (up to 2 years of 
age) accounts for the total burden of wheeze and asthma up to the sixth birthday, and 
test the performance of 3 asthma case definitions – those of Bisgaard, Jackson, and 
ISAAC.  
 
Paragraph 4:  
 
Considering asthma case definitions,  this study anticipates that Bisgaard will be 
more specific and Jackson more sensitive. Although it is likely that the ISAAC 
symptom -based case definitions will be the most sensitive and least specific of all 
three definitions [Yang 2011], its incorporatio n will facilitate wider international 
results comparisons. Hence, this study will assess the performance of the different 
case definitions since this will help planning for phase 3 clinical trials of RSV 
vaccines.  
 
Paragraph 5:  
 
If, in future, a maternal a nd/or pediatric RSV vaccine is introduced, results of this 
study may be used to evaluate post -vaccination incidence reduction (in RSV LRTI 
and/or wheeze and asthma) and the vaccine’s potential public health impact.

 15-DEC -2017  147 *Note: The procedures related to primary study surveillance of RSV LRTI will not be 
extended into the extension period. The extension period will survey for occurrence of 
wheeze and asthma. Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary  
study (documented at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were  
recorded during the examination visits, see Section 9.8.3).  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_333950]. It is possible  that study dropouts  
might occur leading to differential lost to follow up and bias study. Moreover, it is  
possible that a selection bias might occur. Factors pertaining to enrollment of subjects  
into this prospective cohort study would not introduce selec tion bias. In order to  
introduce bias, selection has to be related to both exposure and outcome. But in this  
study, subjects are enrolled in prospective cohort before they experience the outcome of  
interest.  
 
Another potential limitation of this study is t he occurrence of confounding especially  
with potential risk factors. A possible alternative would be to match within a cohort 
study. But this can reduce the efficiency of a cohort study even when there is no sample - 
size reduction and even when the matchin g variable is a confounder. Furthermore, albeit  
cohort matching prevents confounding by [CONTACT_334094], it is not considered an  
advantage of matched designs since in an unmatched study confounding by [CONTACT_334122] s. Hence, in order to deal with the confounding  
factors stratification analysis will be used for each confounder. Multivariate logistic  
regression will also be used to adjust to confounders after selection from the univariate  
logistic regression. All possi ble confounding factors such as gender, geographic ancestry,  
pets, parental smoking and previous maternal or siblings history of asthma will be  
analyzed first in stratification and then in logistic regression (univariate and  multivariate).

20 weeks gestation and before t he start of the delivery. This will be done to ensure that  
the parent(s)/LAR(s) have sufficient time to consider and provide informed consent  
before the subject is born and to obtain a baseline blood cord sample from each subject, 
at birth. Using this samp le, the level of natural protection conferred by [CONTACT_334126] -associated LRTI.  
 
In order to identify all cases of LRTI that occur on  a community level, the cohort of  
infants recruited at birth will be followed -up by [CONTACT_334127][INVESTIGATOR_333954], up to maximum 2 years of age. For the passive  
surveillance, parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects wi ll be instructed to report new RTI  
symptoms of cough or a runny or blocked nose as soon as possible to the  
investigator/study staff. Proper passive surveillance is important in order to identify  
potential cases as early as possible. The active surveillance  is mostly aimed at reinforcing  
the passive surveillance as the chance of pi[INVESTIGATOR_85354] a (developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) case at the exact time  
of the active surveillance contact [CONTACT_334084] . Active surveillance, at a frequency dependent  
of the RSV seasonality, involves regular contact [CONTACT_6823]/study staff with the  
parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects to report any new sign of RTI symptoms (cough, runny  
nose, blocked nose) as soon as possible themselves. In between scheduled active  
surveillance contacts, the study staff can employ activities to solicit passive surveillance  
according to local practices, e.g. reminder emails or text messages up to regular  
community centre visits . 
After identification of a potential case of LRTI based on all reported symptoms, an  
examination visit will be scheduled as early as possible in the disease progression (within  
72 hours after initial identification of a potential LRTI case by [CONTACT_1188]/study  staff 
during a follow -up contact, based on reported symptoms). During this visit, data  
(including RR and SaO2) will be collected on these cases through an initial assessment  
by [CONTACT_334128] (off -site/site) and through a diary card. Nasal  
swabs will be taken by [CONTACT_093]/study staff during the examination visit (off - 
site/site), and will be used to positively identify cases of RSV  infection.  
During the examination visit (off -site/site), an initial assessment of the presence of LRTI  
according to the LRTI case definition for surveillance will be made in order to assess  
the need for a potential subsequent examination visit if the case is found not to be an  
LRTI.  
RSV -associated healthcare resource utilization for RTI wit h a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_333955]. Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked to report any care availed

and/or sites due to the local variations in policy and healthcare.  
 
The association of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_333827] -associated LRTI and/or severe 
LRTI, and the impact of potential RSV risk factors on the incidence and severity of RSV - 
associated LRTI will also be explored. In order to assess and adjust for other pote ntial 
confounders in the various analyses, data on the subjects’ demography and lifestyle 
factors will be collected at baseline, and followed up quarterly for changes, during the 
regular follow -up contacts.  
 
The study has been designed to target a multi -national population by [CONTACT_334129]. Including infants from multiple parts of the world into this  
single study will provide an overall estimate of the incidence of RSV -associated LRTI,  
and will indicate potential variations b etween countries and regions. Data on known and  
suspected risk factors of RSV and/or LRTI will be collected to perform exploratory  
analyses of the association between risk factors and disease.  
 
Recruitment into the study will be controlled as much as possi ble to occur at a stable rate  
using SBIR, so as to achieve a population that is distributed evenly according to their age  
at first exposure to an RSV season. In practice, some subjects will be recruited just at the  
beginning of a season and be exposed imme diately for several months, whereas others  
will be recruited just at the end of a season and thus be at least [ADDRESS_412557] 2000 subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized at recruitment to a time  
point at which a single blood sample will be collected from these subjects if they are still  
participating in the study at that time. This can be either at 2, 4, 6, 12, 1 8 or 24 months  
old. The serum of these samples will be tested for RSV A/B neutralizing antibodies.  
Adjusted for the baseline level of maternal antibodies, this will provide point prevalence  
estimates over time that will indicate the rate of any RSV infecti on in the study  
population, including the cases that did not develop into an LRTI. In addition, especially  
the samples at earlier time points will indicate the duration of persistence of maternal  
antibodies.

In the primary study subjects were to be followed -up from birth up to the age of [ADDRESS_412562] two years of life with other potential risk factors for wh eeze and asthma  
the study will be extended and subjects will be followed -up up to the age of 6 years.*  
 
*Note: The procedures related to primary study (surveillance of RSV LRTI) will not be  
extended into the extension period. The extension period will surv ey for occurrence of  
wheeze and asthma. Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary  
study (documented at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were  
recorded during the examination visits, see Section 9.8.3).  
 
During  the extension subjects will be followed up through quarterly contacts. Parents will  
be encouraged to seek a clinical assessment of their child in between quarterly contacts  
and/or during quarterly contacts whenever their child develops wheezing and/or bre athing  
difficulties.

percentage of children with recurrent wheeze from  at each applicable age 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 
and 5 -6 will be described overall and by [CONTACT_334149].  
 
The risk of physician diagnosed  asthma at the age of 6 years using case definitions 1and 
case definition , 2 and recurrent wheeze  3 (occurring from 2nd to the 6th birthday) will be 
analyzed using multivariate logistic regression model including RSV clinical LRTI in the 
first two years of life (Yes/No)  and other potential risk factors listed above, respectively.  
 
Statistical analysis of agreement will be performed to compare the two case definitions of  
asthma. A 2x2 contingency table similar as for one of the co -primary objective will be  
provided and the following measures of agreement (with 95% CI) will be  
calculated: asthma case definitions 1, 2, and 3  to each other.  
 
• Sensitivity: TP/  (TP+FN)  
• Specificity: TN/  (TN+FP)  
• Positive predictive value (PPV): TP/  (TP+FP)  
• Negative predictive value (NPV): TN/  (TN+FN)  
• Proportion  of overall  agreement,  which  is the proportion  of cases  similarly  classified: 
(TP + TN)/  (TP+FP+FN+TN).  
Cohen’s kappa (or other appropriate) coefficient may be used for the comparisons . The 
magnitude of the kappa coefficient represents the proportion of agreement greater than 
that expected by [CONTACT_3364].

 15-DEC -2017  167 Data for endpoints will be pooled across primary and extension period as follows:  
 
• Medically attended wheeze, in the primary phase corresponds to epi[INVESTIGATOR_333962] a history from parents solicited by [CONTACT_334150] [ADDRESS_412573] with 
health care  provider.  
• Wheeze or asthma requiring admission in the primary phase corresponds to  epi[INVESTIGATOR_333963] a history from parents, which may be 
supplemented by [CONTACT_334151].  
• Prescription of medications for wheeze or asthma in the primary phase will be 
extracted from all treatments that were recorded during the examination visits and  in 
the extension phase by [CONTACT_334152], which 
may be supplemented by [CONTACT_334153].  
• Diagnosis of asthma according to case definition [ADDRESS_412574] of t he 
extension period and annually thereafter until study  conclusion.  
• Diagnosis of recurrent wheeze as [ADDRESS_412575] with health care 
provider.  
 
Section 9.9: Interpretation of  analyses  
 
Analyses  All analyses will be descriptive with the aim to characterise overall 
occurrences, patterns and potential differences between groups in the endpoints related to 
the objectives. No hypothesis testing will be performed . 
 
Section 9.10: Con duct of analyses  
 
Analytic plans may be modified as appropriate to accommodate final sample sizes and 
data distributions. Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan 
outlined in this protocol will be described and justified in the fina l study report.  
 
Section 9.10.1: Sequence of analyses  
 
…… These preliminary results will be used for potential adjustment of the LRTI Case 
Definition and Severity Scale before final analysis, to assess the need to extend the 
primary study to allow all subjects to complete 2 years of follow -up and to provide data 
for other relevant decision making, as soon as possible.* The results pertaining to this 
analysis will be descriptively reported in the an interim statistical report.

Section 9.10.3: Statistical considerations for the extension study  
 
All Statistical analyses pertaining to the extension study will b e performed on all the  data 
collected and cleaned for the subjects who re -consented for the extension. For these  
analyses data from birth up to the age of [ADDRESS_412576] reached four years of age (and 
completed their annual contact, or passed the window for that contact). The interim 
analysis will be purely descriptive, no adjustment of the type I error is f oreseen.  
 
Final extension study analysis will be conducted after all subjects have reached six 
years of age (and completed their annual contact, or passed the window for that 
contact).

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_412577] SCHEDULE to identify any potential 
LRTI case  
 
Active surveillance is aimed at confirming that a case is/was not missed due to lack of 
reporting by [CONTACT_7078](s)/LAR(s) and to remind parent(s)/LAR(s) to report cases of RTI 
symptoms as soon as possible themselves. Although active surveillance is an important  
aspect to ensure that all cases are identified timely, the number of active surveillance  
contacts should not be too high. Too many active surveillance contacts could put an  
unnecessary demand on the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects and has been known to  
negatively impact long term compliance. In order to reduce the number of active  
surveillance contacts to an acceptable and valuable level, the following measures should  
be ap plied.  
Active surveillance is allowed to occur through various media (e.g. text messaging, email 
and, telephone, and in -person) based on local possibilities  
 
DISCONTINUATION OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE  
 
Active surveillance should be suspended after there has been no contact [CONTACT_334081] 3 
planned contacts and/or no contact [CONTACT_334081] 2 months and a final attempt has been 
made by [CONTACT_262909] a live visit. If the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject contact [CONTACT_1275]/study staff at a later point in time through passive surveillance, the case 
should be followed up, data should be collected at intermittent period and active 
surveillance could be reinitiated. These subjects will however no longer be included in 
the ATP cohort, therefore, all efforts should be made to avoid this.

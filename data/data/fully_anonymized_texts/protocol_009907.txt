2. INTRODUCTION  
 
Hematopoietic cell transplantati on (HCT) has been used to treat life -threatening non -malignant 
disorders, including certain inherited disorders, by [CONTACT_781043].  Until recently conventional myeloablative 
regimens; primarily busulphan and cyclophosphamide, have been used to establish hematopoietic 
cell grafts. The significant toxicities associated with conventional regimens often preclude 
transplantation for those severely affected patients with end organ dys function or serious 
infections. In a broader sense, the risks associated with conventional approaches are deemed 
unacceptable for many patients with chronic disorders who might otherwise be cured with HCT. In 
the past [ADDRESS_1073698] been seen; graft rejection and/or low donor chimerism with inadequate disease responses 
have been seen  for certain groups of patients. Thus, there is a need to explore other preparative 
regimens with the goal of decreasing regimen related toxicities and mortalities while preserving 
engraftment and disease  response.  
 
Treosulfan -based regimens are currently being evaluated in Europe as a potential alternative to 
conventional HCT in patients with malignant and nonmalignant diseases and preliminary results 
are very encouraging. This busulfan analog has several attractive characteristics including less 
erratic p harmacokinetics and decreased regimen related toxicities compared to busulfan. The 
primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate, within the limits of a phase II study, the 
preliminary efficacy as defined by [CONTACT_781044], of a regimen consisting o f treosulfan and 
fludarabine followed by [CONTACT_781045].  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
 
3A. Conventional Marrow Transplantation for Treatment of Non -Malignant Disorders  
 
1) Primary Immunodeficiency  diseases.  
 
HCT is effective in the treatment of a variety of primary immunodeficiency disorders, by 
[CONTACT_781046]. Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of H CT using myeloablative 
conditioning for the treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders (excluding 
SCID).4-[ADDRESS_1073699] co -morbid conditions; in particular 
infections; were important factors that impacte d survival. Death from transplant related causes 
including infections, GVHD and end organ toxicity were major problems that limited the 
success of this approach. Therefore, strategies aimed at decreasing toxicity are needed.  
 
2) Metabolic storage  diseases.  
 
Marrow transplantation has been used to treat patients with metabolic storage disorders by 
[CONTACT_781047] a source of deficient enzyme. Conventional 
transplantation results in cure for a substantial number of patients with  certain disorders, 
although TRM and disease progression continue to be problematic. The largest group of 
patients studied are those with mucopolysaccharidosis type 1, wherein successful marrow 
transplantation results in significant reduction of storage ma terial in liver, tonsils, conjunctiva, 
CSF, and urine, improvement of CNS findings on MRI, normalization of hearing, improved left 
ventricular function and resolution of arrhythmia.10,11 Significant amelioration of disease 
symptoms has been associated with  partial as well as complete enzyme replacement.11 
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020

Peters, et al. reported outcome for 54 patients with Hurler syndrome treated with conventional 
marrow transplantation from HLA -identical related (n=28) or haploidentical grafts (n=26; 15/26  
received T -cell deplete grafts). Patients were conditioned with chemotherapy with or without 
TBI.10 Among the 26 evaluable recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -identical related grafts, 22 (85%) achieved 
full donor (n=15) or mixed donor -host (n=7) chimerism, and 4 (15%) fai led to engraft. Among 
the 26 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -haploidentical grafts, 16 (62%) achieved full donor chimerism, 1 (4%) 
achieved mixed donor -host chimerism, and 9 (35%) failed to engraft. Twenty patients (37%) 
died of transplant related causes primarily cardi ac (n=8) or GVHD +/ - infection (n=8). More 
recently, Souillet et al. reported the outcome of 27 patients with Hurlers syndrome who 
received related (n=10) or unrelated (n=17) T -replete grafts (n=26) from primarily bone 
marrow (n=25) following conditioning with busulfan/ cyclophosphamide alone (n=27) or 
combined with ATG (n=20).12 Of the 27 patients, 23 engrafted (full donor n=11, mixed n=10) 
and 4 had primary graft failure. Importantly, disease responses, specifically improvement in 
enzyme activity levels, cognitive function and clinical improvement in somatic disease were 
seen in both the fully engrafted and mixed chimera patients. Staba et al. reported on 20 
patients with Hurlers syndrome who received busulfan/cyclophosphamide and ATG followed 
by [CONTACT_781048].13 With a median follow up of 905 days, 17 children were 
alive with an event free survival of 85%. All living recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780970], 
normal enzyme activity levels and demonstrated improvement in neurocognitive per formance 
and decreased somatic features of Hurler’s  syndrome.  
 
Marrow transplantation has been used to treat other metabolic storage disorders, including 
Sanfilippo A, Sanfilippo B, Hunter syndrome, metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenal 
leukodystrophy, Krabbe’s disease, and Neiman -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206336].14-[ADDRESS_1073700] 
contributed to treatment failure.  
 
3) Thalassemia and other  hemogl obinopathies.  
 
Several studies have demonstrated efficacy of conventional marrow transplantation using 
HLA-identical sibling donors17-[ADDRESS_1073701]. Patients 
with liver fibrosis or hepatomegaly had a 2 -fold increase in risk of mortality. Older age was 
also associated with worse outcome. Recently, Iannone et al. published results on 7 patients 
with sickle cell disea se (n=6) or thalassemia (n=1) who received bone marrow or peripheral 
blood stem cell grafts from HLA -identical siblings following conditioning with 200 cGy TBI and 
fludarabine [30 mg/m2 x 3 days (n=2) or 5 days (n=5)] alone or combined with ATG (n=2).[ADDRESS_1073702] been more sensitized to donor minor histocompatibility 
antigens by [CONTACT_258085]. Therefore, in order to improve the engr aftment rate among 
high-risk patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease, a more aggressive conditioning 
regimen may be required in order to overcome these barriers.

4) Osteopetrosis.  
 
Osteopetrosis is an autosomal recessive disease resu lting from lack of osteoclast resorption of 
bone that causes in marrow failure and nerve entrapment, and early death. Normally 
functioning osteoclasts can be restored by [CONTACT_417929], resulting in amelioration of disease 
symptoms.[ADDRESS_1073703] shown 40 -80% disease -free survivals for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780971]-matched related grafts, and 30 -40% for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780972].31-34 Treatment 
failure is primarily due to tran splant related complications such as infection, GVHD, or toxicity 
in particular hepatic veno -occlusive disease.35 Development of a conditioning regimen with 
decreased toxicity in particular hepatic toxicity would be appealing in this group of patients.  
 
5) Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH).  
 
Marrow transplantation is the only reported cure for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
(HLH), characterized by [CONTACT_781049]. Marrow transplantation has been successful in tr eating 
both the inherited  form,  known  as familial  erythrophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  (FEL),  as well 
as the sporadic form. Henter et al. reported on the outcomes of 65 patients conditioned with 
primarily busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide +/ - ATG.36 At a median follow up of 3.1 
years, the 3 year probability of overall survival was 62%. Twenty (31%) patients died of 
transplant related causes prior to day 100. Recently, Baker et al. reported on the outcomes of 
91 patients with HLH who were conditione d primarily with BU/CY/Etoposide/ATG followed by 
[CONTACT_781050] (86%) grafts.37 The 1 and 5 year overall survivals were 52% and 45% 
respectively after HCT. Day 100 TRM was 33% and was primarily from infections +/ -GVHD 
(n=13) or organ toxicity (n=17) .  These results support the need for new studies with 
potentially lower transplant related  mortality.  
 
6) Inherited Marrow Failure  Syndromes.  
 
Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are genetic disorders that may present at birth or 
later in life and are characterized by [CONTACT_781051] -lineage hematopoiesis with many 
patients progressing to develop severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and the y are often associated 
with congenital defects. Patients are at risk for significant infections due to neutropenia; 
however many patients also have an additional underlying immunodeficiency. In addition, 
patients with bone marrow failure syndromes are at p articularly increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_780973]; in particular myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia, and 
solid tumors. For those patients who develop SAA, the primary curative therapy is 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In  addition, although not the primary goal for 
patients with bone marrow failure associated SAA, HCT has been used to try and prevent the 
development of MDS and myeloid  leukemias.  
 
a. Dyskeratosis  congenita  
 
Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare inherited multi -system disorder characterized by [CONTACT_781052][INVESTIGATOR_16575], dystrophic nails, and oral 
leukoplakia. In addition, several somatic manifestations are seen including skeletal, dental, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, p ulmonary, immunological and ocular abnormalities.[ADDRESS_1073704] been described; however over 75% of the 
cases are an X -linked recessive pattern. The genes identified have been found to encode 
products involved in telomere ma intenance. The primary causes of death are from bone 
marrow failure culminating in SAA. A recent analysis of data from the dyskeratosis 
congenita registry found the probability of developi[INVESTIGATOR_780974] [one or more  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
6  
  
 
peripheral cytop enia(s)] by [CONTACT_654] 40 to be around 94%.[ADDRESS_1073705] found abnormal immunoglobulin production, reduced B and or T lymphocyte 
numbers and reduced T -cell function in patients with DC.39 Other causes of death include 
myeloid and solid tumor malignancies as well as pulmonary failure.  
 
Therapy has consisted of androgens, prednisone, splenectomy and hematopoietic growth 
factors; however none of these has resulted in a cure of the underlying hematopoietic 
disorder. The only definitive treatment for those patients who develop bone marrow failure 
is HCT; however prior studies have demonstrated poor survival due to both early and late 
complications following HCT.40 Langston et al published on 8 patients with DC and aplastic 
anemia who received bone marrow grafts following conditioning with either 
cyclophosphamide ( 140-200 mg/kg) +/ - ATG (HLA -matched related, n=6) or 
Cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and 1200 cGy TBI (HLA -matched unrelated, n=2).41 At the 
time of publication, 7 of the 8 patients died of overwhelming fungal infections (n=3; day +7,  
+13, +14), acute and chr onic interstitial lung disease (n=3; day 70, 8 years, 20 years), and 
1 patient died of acute GVHD. The remaining alive patient has since died of colorectal 
cancer. Rocha et al published on 5 patients with aplastic anemia associated DC who 
received HLA -matc hed related donor grafts following primarily cyclophosphamide (120 -200 
mg/kg) with irradiation (7 Gy TBI or 6 Gy TAI).42 All patients engrafted; however 4 of the 5 
died of transplant related causes including late veno -occlusive disease (n=2), thrombotic 
microangiopathic arterial syndrome (n=1), and invasive aspergillosis (n=1). Others have 
also reported poor outcomes due to significant transplant related complications.38,40,[ADDRESS_1073706] secondary to severe cytopenias.43 The preparative regimen consisted of fludarabin e 
(30mg/m2/day x 5 days), cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day x 2 days), and ATG (40 mg/kg x 
4 days) followed by [CONTACT_781053]. Both patients 
engrafted and are alive with full donor chimerism [ADDRESS_1073707]. Ayas et al. 
recently published 1 case of a 5 year old boy with DC who received cyclophosphamide (15 
mg/kg x 4 days) and ATG (13 mg/kg x 4 days) followed by [CONTACT_44688] -matched related graft.[ADDRESS_1073708] he had 55% and 100% 
donor chimerism in both the lymphoid and myeloid compartments, respectively. Gungor et 
al reported on the treatment of a 10 year old female with DC who had neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia and combined immunodeficiency with recurrent bacterial pulmonary 
infections and disseminated refractory molluscum contagiosum skin infections.45 This 
patient was conditioned with the nonmyeloablative preparative regimen developed at the 
hutch [fludarabine (30mg/m2/day x 3 days) and 2 Gy TBI] followed by G -CSF mobilized 
peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft. This patient is alive and well [ADDRESS_1073709]  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
7  
  
 
with 100% donor chimerism in myeloid and lymphoid lineages and normal  T and B cell 
function. Importantly she has no pulmonary dysfunction.  
 
Due to early and late complications some of which is disease related following more 
aggressive preparative regimens, the outcome following HCT for DC has been poor. 
Although the number of patients reported in these case reports is small, the results are 
encouraging and support further investigation of HCT using reduced intensity preparative 
regimens for patients with DC.  
 
b. Shwachman -Diamond  Syndrome  
 
Shwachman Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease 
characterized by [CONTACT_781054], exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, growth 
retardation and/or short stature and varying degrees of bone marrow dysfunction. The 
primary causes of death are hemorrhage and infections due  to associated hematological 
abnormalities such as marrow aplasia, neutropenia, and MDS/acute leukemia. Similar to 
patients with DC, patients with SDS also have abnormalities in their immune system.  
Specifically, defects in neutrophil mobility, migration a nd chemotaxis as well as B and T cell 
abnormalities have been described.46-[ADDRESS_1073710] been used, the only definitive therapy for marrow aplasia and/or MDS/AML is 
HCT. However, poor outcomes with HCT have been reported due to excessive cardiac a nd 
other organ toxicities which are felt to be due to the preparative regimen.49,50 Cesaro et al. 
recently reported on registry data from the European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow 
Transplantation (EBMT) on 26 patients with SDS and severe bone marrow abn ormalities.51 
Various preparative regimens were used however, the majority contained busulphan (54%) 
followed by [CONTACT_781055] T -cell depleted unrelated donor bone marrow grafts. Five (19%) 
patients failed to engraft. The incidence of grade III -IV and chronic GVHD were 24% and 
29%, respectively. With a median follow up of 1.1 years, the 1 year overall survivals were 
65%. Day 200 and 1 year transplant -related mortalities were 35% for both and were 
primarily due to infections +/ - GVHD (n=5) or major organ toxicit ies (n=3). Based on data 
demonstrating that bone marrow cells of SDS patients have an abnormal susceptibility to 
Fas-mediated apoptosis,[ADDRESS_1073711] f or Treatment of Nonmalignant Disorders - Seattle Experience  
 
1) Immunodeficiency  disorders.  
 
From [ADDRESS_1073712], efforts were focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a myeloablative conditioning regimen 
sufficient for engraftment of marrow from related, and eventually unrelated,  donors for 
treatment of nonmalignant disorders, including immunodeficiency disorders. Busulfan and 
cyclophosphamide were the backbone of the regimen, which eventually included anti - 
thymocyte globulin (ATG). Twenty -four patients with primary immunodeficie ncy disorders 
were transplanted at the FHCRC between March [ADDRESS_1073713] 2005. Currently, 14 of 24 
patients are alive; while 10 patients died from infections +/ - GVHD (n=6), veno -occlusive 
disease (n=2), multi -organ failure (n=1), and graft rejection wit h subsequent disease

recurrence (n=1). Day 100 and 200 TRM were 29% for both. With a median follow up for the 
living recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] 11.3 (range, 2.4 -26.1) years, the 12 -year overall survival, event free survival 
and TRM were 58%, 58% and 38%  respectively. Further analysis suggested that tolerance of 
the conditioning regimen depended upon diagnosis. Among the 11 patients with WAS, 10 are 
surviving a median of 8 years (range 2 -26) years after HCT with disease resolution while one 
patient died o f infection. In comparison, 4 of the 13 patients with other immunodeficiency 
disorders survive long -term. TRM by [CONTACT_4475] 100 for the latter group was 46%, compared to 10% 
for the WAS patients. These analyses show that, while conventional HCT was an effective 
therapy for patients with immunodeficiency disorders, early TRM was prohibitive among the 
subgroup of patients with diagnoses other than WAS. For the most part, the high day [ADDRESS_1073714].  
 
2) Other inherited  disorders.  
 
Fifty-three patients with metabolic storage diseases (n=10), red cell disorders (n=26), 
Osteopetrosis (n=8), and HLH/Gricellis syndrome (n=9) were transplanted at the FHCRC 
between October 1981 and October 2007. Day 100 a nd 200 TRM were 21% and 25%, 
respectively. The 15 -year overall and event free survival and TRM for the entire group was 
50%, 45% and 27%, respectively after HCT. An analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=27 
metabolic storage diseases, osteopetrosis and HLH)  demonstrated that 37% of the patients 
died by [CONTACT_4475] 200 of transplant related causes. Therefore, efforts at decreasing the toxicity of 
the conditioning regimen thereby [CONTACT_781056].  
 
3C. Treosulfan  
 
1) Mechanism of action, activity, pharmacokinetics and  toxicity.  
Treosulfan (Ovastat®, L -treitol -1,4-bis-methanesulfonate, dihydroxybusulfan, TREO; Medac, 
Hamburg, [LOCATION_013]) is a prodrug of 2 biologically active epoxy -derivatives and a water -soluble 
intravenous Busulfan analog approved for therapy of advanced ovarian car cinoma in Europe. 
Under physiologic conditions, Treosulfan is non -enzymatically, in a pH -dependent manner, 
spontaneously activated into the monoepoxide((2S,3S) -1,2-epoxybutane -3,4-diol-4-methane - 
sulfonate, S,S -EBDM), which converts to (2S,3S) -1,2:3,4 -diepoxybutane (S,S -DEB). The 
formed epoxy -transformers are responsible for cross -linking of DNA molecules and cytotoxicity  
in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_114415], both malignant and non - 
malignant, such as normal hematopoietic cells.53 
Contrary to Busulfan, Treosulfan does not require 
enzymatic activation, thus by[CONTACT_781057]. The hydroxyl groups in positions 2 and  
Figure 1. Molecular structures  of 
busulfan and  tresoulfan  3 of the molecule account for differences in 
pharmacological activity between Treosulfan and 
Busulfan (Figure 1). Busulfan directly alkylates  
nucleophilic cent ers, while Treosulfan induces alkylation of nucleophilic centers by 
[CONTACT_781058]. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that 
Treosulfan has a similar t½ to Busulfan (1.8 – 2 hours) and a higher, dose -independent, 
cumulative  renal excretion (50% vs. 20%).54,[ADDRESS_1073715] demonstrated low inter -patient and inter -day 
variability. There is a high linear correlation between the area under the curve and Treosulfan 
dose (r2=0.9227), which compares favorably with that of oral and intravenous Busulfan.56,57 On CH 3O2SO-CH 2CH 2CH 2CH 2-OSO 2CH 3 Busulfan

FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073716] 10 times 
lower acute and chronic toxicity than  Busulfan [unpublished data, Investigator’s Brochure].  
 
The pronounced effect of Treosulfan on primitive and committed hematopoietic stem cells and 
its immunosuppressive effects have been demonstrated in allogeneic murine transplant 
models.53 At doses 80 -88% lower than those used for humans in clinical trials, Treosulfan was 
at least as effective as Busulfan in depleting hematopoietic cell subsets (Figure 2). Treosulfan 
was capable of inducing full donor engraftment and immune tolerance across MHC barriers.  
Marrow suppression is the limiting toxicity for convent ional chemotherapy with Treosulfan at 
doses over 10 g/m2. With autologous stem cell rescue, the Treosulfan dose could be 
escalated up to 47 g/m2 before dose -limiting toxicity including mucositis, diarrhea, dermatitis or 
metabolic acidosis was  observed.58 
 
2)  Initial phase I/II studies of Treosulfan -containing regimens for allogeneic HCT – 
European  Experience  
 
2a. Treosulfan and fludarabine  
Fifty-six patients, median age 50 (range 18 -66) years, with varied hematologic malignancies 
received three doses of 10, 12 or 14 g/m2  Treosulfan and 5 doses of 30 mg/kg FLU 
followed by [CONTACT_44688] -identical sibling (n=28) or matched unrelated (n=28) marrow or PBSC.59 
GVHD  prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine with or without thymoglobulin (unrelated 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_190852]). All patients engrafted, with a median time to neutrophil engraftment of 14 
(range 10 -23) days. Acute GVHD of grades II -IV and extensive chronic GVHD were 
obse rved in 24/56 (43%) and 8/42 (19%) evaluable patients, respectively. Significant grade 
3 toxicities included elevation of bilirubin or liver transaminases (n=7), diarrhea (n=3), 
mucositis (n=2), dyspnea (3) and elevation of creatinine (n=1). Eight (15%) pa tients died 
from relapse. Eleven (20%) patients died from non -relapse causes, 8 from infection, 2 from 
GVHD with or without infection, and 1 from RRT (myocardial infarction). The 1 -year DFS is 
53%, with a median follow -up of 21 months. These results sugges t that the combination of 
Treosulfan /FLU may result in improved RRT and NRM and similar survival compared to 
Treosulfan /CY. Recently several other groups have published encouraging results in 
patients with hematologic malignancies using a Treosulfan/flud arabine based conditioning 
regimen.60-62 
 
2b. Experience with use of Treosulfan in children  
The experience with this drug in patients of pediatric age is limited. Wachowiak and 
colleagues conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_780975] -containing preparative regim ens for 
children. Eight children considered at high risk for toxicity from conventional regimens, of 
median age 11 (4 -13) years, and diagnosis of AML (n=3), ALL (n=1), MDS (n=1), 
histiocytosis (n=1), Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome  
(n=1) or adrenoleukodystrophy ( n=1) were 
studied. They received three doses of 10 
g/m2 Treosulfan in combination with other 
drugs including FLU, CY, melphalan or 
etoposide, followed by [CONTACT_44688] -identical sibling 
marrow (n=7) or cord blood (n=1). GVHD 
prophylaxis was with cyclosporine only. A ll 
patients engrafted, with a median time to 
neutrophil engraftment of 19 (range 10 -22) 
days. Acute grade II GVHD was observed in 
3 (38%) patients. Extensive chronic GVHD 
was observed in 1 (13%) patient. Severe or  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
10  
  
 
fatal toxicities were not observed. Three patients developed mild (Bearman grade I) 
mucositis or transient elevation of liver transaminases (n=2). Two (25%) patients relapsed. 
The remaining 6 patients are alive and disease -free, with a median follow -up of 12 months.  
 
More recently, Sauer63 et al. published on 3 patients with Shwachman -Diamond Syndrome 
who received treosulfan (12 g/m2/d x 3), fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d x 6), and Melphalan (140 
mg/m2/d x 1) in combination with CAMPATH -1H (0.1 mg/kg x 2) in 2 cases and ATG i n one 
case followed by [CONTACT_44688] -identical sibling (n=1), HLA -matched unrelated donor (n=1) or 9/[ADDRESS_1073717] 
and had 100% donor chimerism at last follow up.  Two of the [ADDRESS_1073718] for nonmalignant disease s including primary 
immunodeficiency (n=18), metabolic disorders (n=9), osteopetrosis (n=4) and thalassemia 
(n=1).64 Patients received a total treosulfan dose of 36 g/m2  (n=6) or 42 g/m2  (n=26) given 
in three divided doses on consecutive days. A variety of other conditioning agents were 
used depending on the stem cell source and donor type including fludarabine (150 mg/m2) 
Cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m2), plus or minus Campath or ATG. HLA -matched or 
mismatched related or unrelated bone marrow (n=17), periphe ral blood (n=9), and cord 
blood (n=5) grafts were used as the stem cell source. Post HCT immunosuppression 
included Cyclosporine alone or combined with Mycophenolate Mofetil, methylprednisolone, 
or methotrexate. Twenty eight patients (87.5%) established do nor cell engraftment; 
however, [ADDRESS_1073719] required additional transplantation procedures to maintain 
adequate donor derived hematopoiesis. With a median follow up of 471 days, 27 (84%) of 
the patients survive.  One patient died early (day +4) due to s inusoidal obstructive 
syndrome and four other deaths were late due to disease progression, GVHD or infection. 
The incidence of GVHD was very low with 6 (19%) patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_780976] (n=4) 
or grade III (n=2) acute GVHD and 4 (13%) or patients dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_780977].  
Although multiple different donors and conditioning regimens were used, these results are  
encouraging in pediatric patients with nonmalignant disorders.  
 
Bernardo et al recently published on 20 patients with Thalassemia who were condi tioned 
with Thiotepa (8 mg/kg; day -7), Treosulfan (14 g/m2; days -6 to -4), and fludarabine (40 
mg/m2; days -6 to -3) followed by [CONTACT_781059] (n -3) or unrelated (n=17) bone 
marrow grafts. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of Cyclosporine and methotrexate . 
Pretransplantation ATG (10 mg/kg; days -5 to -3) was administered to all the unrelated graft 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Two patients experienced secondary graft failure. Cumulative incidence of TRM 
was 5% and the 2 year probability of survival and thalassemia -free surv ival was 95% and 
85%, respectively.  
 
2c. Phase I/II Study of Treosulfan and fludarabine in the [LOCATION_002] - 
Protocol 1931 -Preliminary Results  
Forty -six patients, median age 41 years (5 -59 years), with acute myeloid leukemia in first 
remission (n=22), second remission (n=9), partial remission or relapse (n=5) or ALL in 
second remission (n=2) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=8) have been enrolled on  study. 
Eight of the AML patients had secondary (treatment -induced) AML and [ADDRESS_1073720] patients had underlying conditions that made them poor 
candidates for conventional myeloablative regimens. All patients received t herapy as per 
protocol with treosulfan (5 at dose level 1 or 12 g/m2/day, and 41 at dose level 2 or 14  
g/m2/day) on days -6 to -4 and fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) on days -6 to -2. Patients 
received HLA -matched sibling grafts (n=1 marrow, n=23 PBSC), or unre lated grafts (n=6 
marrow, n=16 PBSC) on day 0. Neutrophil engraftment occurred in 100% of 43 evaluable 
patients at a median of 17 (range, 5 -30) days after HCT. Acute graft -versus -host disease  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020

(GVHD) has been observed in 25 of 43 evaluable p atients (grade I -II). Chronic GVHD has 
been observed in 13 of 35 evaluable patients. Dose limiting toxicity has been observed in 1 
of 46 patients ( Table 1 ). There have been [ADDRESS_1073721] relapsed at a median of 76 (26 -184) days, of which [ADDRESS_1073722] died of disease 
recurrence. Thirty -six patients are alive and disease -free, with a median follow -up of 204 
(range, 10 -711) days a fter HCT.  
 
Table 1: Outcomes Summary  
Probability (%)  100-day 200-day 1-year 
OS [ADDRESS_1073723] demonstrated highly predictable PK in adult patients; however, limited data 
are available for pediatric patients. In addition, very little data is available on the relationship 
between treosulfan exposure and HCT outcomes including early toxic ities and engraftment. 
Van der Stoep recently published on treosulfan pharmacokinetics and the drug’s 
relationship with regimen -related toxicity and early clinical outcome in 77 pediatric patients 
with hematological malignancies (n=12) or non -malignant dis eases (n=65) who underwent 
HCT. Conditioning consisted of treosulfan, fludarabine, +/ - thiotepa (n=52) followed by [CONTACT_44688] - 
matched sibling n=27, matched URD ( >9/10; n=36), or haploidentical (n=14)  grafts.  
Hematopoietic cell sources varied and included bone ma rrow (n=50), PBSC (n=20), cord 
blood (n=6), and bone marrow plus cord blood (n=1). Van der Stoep and colleagues 
reported low intra -patient variability (13.9%) but high inter -patient variability [56%; <1 -year 
old, (n=12) and 33%; ≥1 to 21 years of age (n=65 )] among [ADDRESS_1073724] to that seen in adult patients where there is low intra - and low inter -patient 
variability. In addition, high treosulfan exposure (>1650 mg*h/L) was associated with an 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_30462] 2  or higher mucositis [OR 4.40; 95% CI 1.19 –16.28, 
p=0.026], increased risk of skin toxicity, including erythematous rash and skin exfoliation, 
[OR 4.51; 95% CI 1.07 -18.93; p=0.040], and increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_780978] 
[OR 4.52; 95%CI 1.32 -15.53, p=0.016] compared to the lower exposure (<1350 mg*h/L) 
group. The authors highlighted that their study included a heterogeneous group of diseases 
and additional data in more homogeneous and single disease groups with longer follow up 
are needed in o rder to better understand the relationship between AUC and long -term 
outcomes. We plan on collecting PK samples on patients enrolled on this clinical trial in 
order to gain a better understanding whether the exposure to treosulfan AUC for pediatric 
patient s with nonmalignant diseases impacts engraftment and both acute and long -term 
toxicities.  This information will help guide future studies using treosulfan -based 
conditioning in patients with non -malignant  diseases.  
 
3D. Fludarabine  
Fludarabine (Fludara) is a purine analog that inhibits lymphocyte proliferation, promotes 
lymphocyte apoptosis, and is effective in the treatment of lymphoid and myeloid 
malignancies.65-67 Fludarabine is phosphorylated intracellularly in several steps to its active 
form 2 -fluoroadenosine arabinoside triphosphate, which acts by [CONTACT_450617].65,66 
Fludarabine induces immunosuppression and long -lasting lymphopenia reducing the 
incidence of GVHD and facilitating engraftment along histocompatibility barriers when used i n 
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or low -dose TBI.66,68 
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073725] been associated with mixed 
donor/host chimerism or graft rejection.70,[ADDRESS_1073726] increased barriers to engraftment due to characteristics of their underlying 
disease, which pose further challenges to sustained engraftment, particularly following 
reduced intensity conditioning. Finally, am elioration of many nonmalignant diseases requires 
high-level multi -lineage donor chimerism.  
 
Thus, the goal of this study for patients with nonmalignant diseases is to develop a regimen 
that overcomes the barriers of engraftment without increasing the toxi cities and mortality of 
the transplant procedure. Results of the current trial using a reduced toxicity/intensity regimen 
of Treosulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit ATG are encouraging, with excellent overall survival 
and very low transplant -related mortality.  However, mixed donor/host chimerism remains a 
challenge, particularly in patients with diseases that have barriers to engraftment. Several 
clinical trials have shown that in the setting of reduced intensity or nonmyeloablative 
conditioning, engraftment is  superior when the graft is composed of peripheral blood stem 
cells (PBSC) compared to bone marrow. 72 Slatter et al. recently published on 160 pediatric 
patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases who received Treosulfan, fludarabine +/ - 
Campath (n=15 4) followed by [CONTACT_781060]. The initial stem cell source 
was bone marrow; however due to a high proportion of patients with poor engraftment or low - 
level donor chimerism, the trial transitioned to PBSC grafts. Results show a signific ant 
association between high -level donor myeloid chimerism (>95% donor) and use of PBSCs 
without an increased risk of significant GVHD. 73 Although the number of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780979] 2256 (Regimen A) has been low (n=10), we have not seen  an increased 
risk for GVHD in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780980]. Therefore, going forward in this 
clinical trial, PBSCs will be prioritized whenever feasible with the goal of improving donor 
engraftment, in particular CD33 myeloid  engraftment.

6. DONOR  SELECTION  
Regimen A: Bone marrow or Peripheral Blood or HLA -matched sibling bone marrow 
combined with HLA -matched sibling cord blood  
 
A. Inclusions : Donors must  be: 
1. HLA-identical related donors  or 
2. Unrelated donors matched for HLA -A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 or mismatched for a 
single allele at HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 or a single DQB1 antigen or allele mismatch by 
[CONTACT_781063][INVESTIGATOR_007].  
3. PBSC is the preferred cell source (when feasible) for fully matched donors. PBSC 
may also be used for a mismatched donor following discussion with the PI. Bone 
marrow is allowed when PBSC is not feasible or as determined by [CONTACT_32816]. 
4. HLA-matched  sibling  bone  marrow  in combination  with HLA-matched  sibling  umbilical 
cord blood if the HLA -matched sibling umbilical cord blood was collected and stored. 
The HLA-matched  sibling  bone  marrow  and cord blood  would  be matched  for HLA-A, 
B, C, DRB1, and DQB1.  
 
B. Exclusions : Ineligible donors will be  those:  
1. Deemed unable to undergo marrow harvesting or PBSC mobilization and 
leukapheresis.  
2. HIV-positive.  
3. With active infectious hepatitis.  
4. Females with a positive pregnancy  test. 
5. HLA-matched sibling cord blood  exclusions:  
a. Any cord blood units that have not passed donor screening for infectious disease 
markers as recommended by [CONTACT_781064] (NMDP) will not 
be used unless a waiver is signed by [CONTACT_781065]. Cord b lood units are presumed to be CMV negative regardless of 
serologic testing due to passive transmission of maternal CMV  antibodies.  
 
Regimen B: Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood will be allowed if an HLA -matched related 
or unrelated donor is not identified or available  
 
A. Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood  Inclusions:  
 
1. Unit selection is based on the cryopreserved total nucleated cell (TNC) dose and 
matching at HLA -A, B antigen level and DRB1 allele level typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. While HLA -C 
antigen/allele level typi[INVESTIGATOR_780981], if available, may 
be used to optimize unit  selection.  
2. The patient and the cord blood unit(s) must be matched for at least 4 of 6 loci as 
defined  above.  
3. Selection of two UCB units is allowed to provide sufficient cell dose (see 3d below 
for algorithm to determine single versus double unit transplant). When multiple units 
are selected, the following rules  apply:  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073730] HLA disparity (with the patient) will be selected 
first (i.e., selection pri ority is 6/6 match >5/6 match>4/6 match). Additional UCB 
units then may be selected to achieve the required cell dose, as outlined below 
(3e). If a second unit is required, this unit will be the unit that most closely HLA 
matches the patient and meets mini mum size criteria outlined below of at  least  
1.5 x 107 TNC/kg (i.e. a smaller more closely matched unit will be selected over 
a larger less well matched unit as long as minimum criteria are met).  
b. Each UCB unit MUST contain at least 1.[ADDRESS_1073731] blood transplant: The donor 
selection algorithm has been designed to favor single cord HCT to decrease the 
risk of GVHD in the nonmali gnant setting while attempting to not compromise 
engraftment.  
 
 Single Unit 
Allowed for:  Multiple Units 
Required for:  
Match Grade  TNC Dose  TNC Dose  
6/6 ≥ 3.0 x 107/kg < 3.0 x 107/kg 
5/6 ≥ 4.0 x 107/kg <4.0 x 107/kg 
4/6 ≥ 6.0 x 107/kg <6.0 x 107/kg 
 
4. General  Comments:  
a. Units will be selected first based on the TNC dose and HLA  matching.  
b. CD34+ cell dose will not be used for unit selection unless 2 units of equal  HLA- 
match grade and similar TNC dose (± 0.5 x 107 TNC/kg) are available. In this 
case, the u nit with the larger CD34+ cell dose (if data available) should be 
selected.  
c. A UCB unit that is 5/6 mismatched but homozygous at the locus of mismatch 
should be chosen over a 5/6 unit with bidirectional mismatch even if the latter 
unit is larger (has more c ells). This also applies to 4/[ADDRESS_1073732] number of cells will 
be chosen. If there are two units of equivalent cell dose (± 0.5 x 107 TNC/kg) 
within a match level, choose the unit with match by [CONTACT_781066][INVESTIGATOR_007], if  known . 
e. Other factors to be  considered:  
1. Within the same HLA match grade, matching at DR takes  preference.  
2. Cord blood banks located in the [LOCATION_002] are  preferred.  
3. The youngest unit would be  preferred.  
 
B. Unrelated UCB Unit  Exclusions:  
1. Any cord blood units with <1.[ADDRESS_1073733] blood units are 
presumed to be CMV negative regardless of serologic testing due to passive 
transmission of maternal CMV  antibodies.  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073734] a conference with the patient and family to discuss this 
study and alternative treatments available. In a separate conference, the risks of the donation 
procedure will be outlined to the donor and/or his parent/guardian (s), including the risks of 
anesthesia, bleeding, and infection. The goals of the study, requirement for data collection, and 
requirement for release of medical records will be discussed with the patient and/or his/her 
parent/guardian. All potential risks associated with the use of treosulfan, fludarabine, low dose 
TBI (cord only), immunosuppressive drugs and allogeneic HCT will be discussed as objectively 
as possible. Discussion of potential complications should include graft rejection, GVHD, 
infections, a nd death.  
 
Informed consent from the patient and donor will be obtained using forms approved by [CONTACT_781067]. Informed consent 
will be obtained by [CONTACT_079], Co -Investigator, or Attending Physician who is 
familiar with the study but not necessarily an investigator. When patients are less than 18 years 
of age, consent will be obtained from parents or legal guardian(s). All patients enrolled at 
collaborating centers will engage i n institution -specific informed consent conferences after 
completion of the pre -transplant evaluation. Informed consent from the donor and patient will be 
obtained using a form approved by [CONTACT_781068].

1. Treosulfan.  
 
Treosulfan will be administered intravenously over 120 minutes for three consecutive 
days (day –6 to –4). Use actual weight to calculate BSA. For patients >120% of ideal 
weight, use adjusted weight to calculate BSA. Optional pharmacokinetic evaluation will  
be performed on days -6 (all patients) and -5 (only in patients who are < 4 years of age 
at time of start of conditioning; see Section 14B.7).  
 
Treosulfan will be supplied to investigators by [CONTACT_781069], Hamburg [LOCATION_013] under 
an IND held by [CONTACT_781070] n Cancer Research Center (IND 72,479). The drug will 
be delivered by [CONTACT_781071]’ pharmacy as a clinical 
investigational product with a study -specific label on the glass vial, as approved by [CONTACT_1556]. Treosulfan is available as a w hite crystalline powder in vials of [ADDRESS_1073739] be dissolved in 20 ml (1 g vial) or 100 ml (5g vial) of 0.45% sodium chloride 
solution , for injection for  a final concentration of 50 mg/ml. The 0.45% sodium chloride 
must be warmed to 25 -30ºC (not higher) using a warmer or water bath. The 
reconstituted solution should remain at room temperature and be used the day of 
preparation. The reconstituted solution s hould not be stored in a refrigerator because 
crystallization may occur at low temperatures. Acidic media do not influence the stability 
of treosulfan. In alkaline and neutral solutions treosulfan decomposes to 
methanesulfonic acid and threitol. The recons tituted solution has a physicochemical 
stability of at least [ADDRESS_1073740] been isolated reports of seizure in infants after combined administration of 
Treosulfan with Fludarabine or cycloph osphamide. Therefore, seizure prophylaxis 
during Treosulfan administration should be considered for patients ≤ 1 year of age. We 
recommend the following: for patients ≤ 1 year begin levetiracetam (Keppra) at 10 
mg/kg every 12 hours to start the evening pri or to Treosulfan administration and 
continue until 24 hours after the infusion.  
 
2. Fludarabine.  
 
Fludarabine will be administered intravenously at a dose of 30 mg/m2/day over 60 
minutes for five consecutive days (day –6 to –2). On days –6 to –4, fludarabine will be 
given after the treosulfan dose is given. For patients > 120% of ideal weight, BSA will be 
calculated using adjusted weight. Fludarabine (Fludara, Berlex Laboratories, Inc., 
Richmond, CA) is commercially available in the U.S. Details of the produc t’s description, 
preparation; storage and stability are found in the drug’s package insert.  
 
3. Rabbit Anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG;  Thymoglobulin®)  
 
Thymoglobulin will be administered intravenously over three consecutive days (days -4, 
-3, -2) at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg on day -4, and then 2.5 mg/kg on days -3 and -2 for a total 
dose of 6.0 mg/kg. Thymoglobulin will be given intravenously over a minimum of  [ADDRESS_1073741] practice. Doses should be based on actual body  weight.

Anti-Human Thymocyte Globulin (ATG; Sangstat Medical Corp., Fremont, CA) is an 
immunosupp ressant which alters the function of or eliminates T -cells and NK cells. 
Rabbit anti -thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin®) is a polyclonal immunoglobulin 
mixture (IgM/IgG) raised in rabbits against human T thymocytes which reduces all 
circulating lymphocytes  or lymphocyte subsets. ATG is used in preparation for 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), as immunosuppressive therapy in aplastic anemia 
or MDS, and for GVHD treatment.

10. COLLECTION OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM  CELLS/INFUSION  
 
Related donors will be collected at each participating center and unrelated donors will be 
collected through the NMDP or other donor collection centers.  
 
A. PBSC: Is the preferred stem cell source for fully matched donors. PBSC may also be 
used for a mismatch ed donor following discussion with the PI. PBSC collection and 
infusion will be according to institutional standard practice  guidelines.  
 
B. Bone Marrow: Donors will undergo standard bone marrow harvest following each center’s 
standard practice. The marrow wi ll be infused according to each center’s standard practice 
guidelines.  
C. Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood: will be used if an HLA -matched related or 
unrelated donor is not identified or available (see matching criteria section  6) 
 
1. Procedures for requesting, re ceiving and characterizing the cord blood unit for infusion 
will be according to institutional standard  practice.  
2. Pre-infusion hydration should be performed per institutional  guidelines.  
3. For FHCRC patients, the cord blood unit should be thawed and infused per FHCRC 
standard practice guidelines. Cord blood products should be infused without delay as 
soon as the product arrives on the  unit. 
4. The infusion should take no longer than [ADDRESS_1073743] blood from the same HLA -matched sibling donor: 
At the discretion of the PI, bone marrow and cord blood cells from the same HLA –matched 
sibling may be used togethe r for the transplant in cases where such cord blood cells were 
previously stored and found to be qualified for use as a donor for stem cell  transplant.  
1. The HLA -matched sibling umbilical cord blood unit will be deemed qualified for use in 
combination with bone marrow when the matched sibling cord blood unit meets the 
eligibility criteria outlined in section [ADDRESS_1073744]  blood  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073745] accredited, documents regarding verific ation 
of HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cell count (including total nucleated cell count and CD34 if available), 
pre-cryopreservation viability, and infectious disease testing will be requested and 
reviewed prior to release of this cord blood unit for clinical  use. 
3. Procedures for infusion of the HLA -matched sibling bone marrow and HLA -matched 
sibling cord blood cells will follow institutional standard practice guidelines for each cell 
product.  
4. Procedures for requesting, receiving and characterizing the cord blood uni t for infusion 
will be according to institutional  practice.  
5. Pre-infusion hydration should be performed per institutional  guidelines.  
6. Conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis will be per regimen  A. 
7. Patients receiving HLA -matched sibling bone marrow and HLA -matched sibling cord 
blood products may have infusions that go over [ADDRESS_1073746] blood infusion should take no longer than 30 minutes. Pre -medications (if 
any) prior to cord blood infusion will be at the discretion of the attending. Under no 
circumstances is the cord blood to be irradiated. No medicati ons or fluids should be 
given pi[INVESTIGATOR_780985].  
10. The product is infused via IV drip directly into the central line according to standard 
practice with gravity filtered  tubing.  
11. Vital signs should  be monitored before beginning the bone marrow and cord blood 
infusion and periodically during administration. Notify the attending physician,  fellow, 
PA or NP immediately if the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of a  reaction.  
12. Benadryl, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and hydrocortisone should be available at the bedside for 
emergency use if necessary.  
13. Oxygen with nasal prongs for standby [CONTACT_781073].  
 
11. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:  
 
Regimen A: Bone Marrow or PBSC or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -matched sibling bone marrow 
combined with HLA -matched sibling cord blood  
 
All patients who receive bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells will receive 2 agents for 
GVHD prophylaxis as follows:  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073747] Practice Guidelines as an IV continuous 
infusion on day –1 at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day. Dosing should be based on adjusted 
body weight. If actual weight is less than adjusted body wei ght, dosing should be 
based on actual weight. The same lumen of the central catheter should be used for all 
tacrolimus infusions. Conversion to the oral formulation (IV:PO ratio 1:4) should be 
made when oral feeding is established. Oral tacrolimus is avail able in 0.5, 1 and 5 mg 
capsules and as a compounded suspension of 1 mg/mL. Oral tacrolimus should be 
given in two divided daily doses every 12 hours. If the patient vomits within one hour of 
taking the medication, repeat the dose. If vomiting persists, th e medication should be 
given intravenously at the appropriate dose (PO:IV ratio 4:1). Beverages containing 
the enzyme bergamottin (grapefruit juice, Sunny Delight, Fresca and Squirt) should be 
avoided. If possible, oral tacrolimus should be taken on an emp ty stomach at a 
consistent time each  day. 
 
2. In the absence of GVHD, we recommend that the tacrolimus be tapered starting on 
day +50. In the absence of GVHD, the dose should be tapered by 5% each week for 
liquid and 20% each month for capsules. In the presence of GVHD, or if the patient is 
receiving corticosteroids or other therapy for GVHD, tacrolimus should not be tapered 
at day +50, and dosing should be maintained to target therapeutic levels. Long -term 
administration of tacrolimus will be per the recommendations of the Long -term Follow - 
up Departm ent (LTFU).  
 
3. Tacrolimus levels : Tacrolimus levels should be maintained in the range of 5 -15 ng/ml. 
In patients who are also taking sirolimus, it is generally recommended that tacrolimus 
trough levels not exceed 10ng/ml. Tacrolimus levels will be performed weekly starting 
on day +2 through day +[ADDRESS_1073748] Practice Guidelines, see Calcineurin Inhibitor 
Therapy (Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus) section. To avoid contamination, all levels should 
be drawn from the central catheter port opposite the lumen used to i nfuse tacrolimus. 
If a tacrolimus taper is initiated at day +50, and the patient has adequate oral fluid 
intake and stable volume status, checking of blood levels may generally be 
discontinued once tacrolimus has been reduced by 25%. If a tacrolimus taper is not 
initiated, levels should be performed weekly through day +100. Tacrolimus levels 
should be performed more frequently 1) when the medication is converted from oral to 
IV or IV to oral; 2) when dose adjustments are made due to levels outside the 
thera peutic range; or 3) if toxicity is suspected. Steady state levels will not be achieved 
for at least [ADDRESS_1073749] an accurate steady state  concentration.

B. Methotrexate  
 
1. Administration:  
 
a. In adults and children > 10 kg, methotrexate should be administered as an IV push 
at a dose of 15 mg/m2 on day +1 after transplant and at 10 mg/m2 on days +3, +6 
and +[ADDRESS_1073750] Practice  Guidelines.  
 
b. Infants who weigh  < [ADDRESS_1073751] methotrexate dosed on a per kilogram 
(actual weight) basis rather than per meter squared. Therefore, the methotrexate 
dose is 0.5 mg/kg on Day + 1 and 0.33 mg/kg on Days +3, +6 and  +11. 
 
c. The first dose of methotrexate should be given approximately 24 hours after 
completion of the initial stem cell infusion, but no sooner than 24 hours  later.  
 
2. Toxicities: In this setting, mucositis is the primary toxicity related to methotrexate. In 
the setting of renal or hepatic dysfun ction, where there is impaired clearance of the 
medication, methotrexate may contribute to delayed neutrophil engraftment. 
Methotrexate may cause an elevation in serum  transaminase.  
 
3. Dose adjustments - Every attempt should be made to administer methotrexat e as 
prescribed, as dose reduction or omission may increase the risk of acute GVHD. 
Patients at greatest risk for methotrexate -related toxicities are those with either 
decreased renal function or significant fluid collection (i.e. ascites, pleural effusio ns, 
etc.), where methotrexate can accumulate and, thus, delay clearance. Renal 
dysfunction or third space fluid accumulation are not strict contraindications to the 
administration of methotrexate, although dose reduction (75 –50%) and rescue with 
leucovorin  (citrovorum factor) should be considered. Similarly, while one may want to 
discontinue methotrexate in patients who require intubation because of severe 
mucositis, generally mucositis should not be a contraindication for the use of 
methotrexate.  
 
4. Methotrexate levels  should be monitored in patients at risk for the development of 
toxicity.  Acceptable  methotrexate  levels  at 24 hours  or later after the administration  of

methotrexate are <0.04 x 10-6 molar (see Figure 3 ). If toxic levels  are present, 
leucovorin should be given per our Standard Practice Guidelines . The standard dose 
of leucovorin is 10 mg/m2 IV every 6 hours.  
 
 
Regimen B: Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood:  
 
All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780986] 2 drugs 
as follows:  
 
A. Cyclosporine  A 
1. Patients will receive cyclosporine A (CSA) therapy beginning on Day -3 maintaining a 
trough level between 200 and 400 ng/mL by [CONTACT_183628] (250 and 500 ng/ml by 
[CONTACT_45004]). For adults the initial dose will be 2.5 mg/kg IV over 1 hour every 12 
hours. For children < 4 0 kg the initial dose will be 2.5 mg/kg IV over 1 hour every 8 
hours. The initial dose will be based on adjusted body  weight.  
2. Dose adjustments will be made on the basis of toxicity and low CSA levels with 
trough level of <200 mg/L (HPLC). Once the patient can tolerate oral medications, 
CSA will be converted to an oral form. CSA dosing will be monitored and altered as 
clinically appropriate.  
3. Patients will receive CSA until Day +100. If there is no evidence of GVHD, the dose 
will then be tapered 10% per week starting on Day +[ADDRESS_1073752] CSP levels  are:

B. Mycophenolate mofetil  (MMF)  
 
1. MMF will be administered at 15 mg/kg every 8 hours with a maximum of 1 gram/dose 
beginning the evening of day 0 (i.e. first dose to follow 4 -6 hours after UCBT). The 
dose will be based on adjusted body  weight.  
2. MMF will be given every [ADDRESS_1073754] -transplant and then in the 
absence of GVHD, tapered by 12%/week with MMF discontinued after day +  96. 
3. Markedly low (<40%) donor T cell chimerism after UCBT may indicate impending 
graft rejection. MMF should be continued at full dose or, if MMF tape r has been 
initiated, reinstitution of full dose MMF should occur. If MMF has been discontinued, 
MMF should be reinitiated at full  dose.  
 
12. SUPPORTIVE  CARE  
 
All supportive care will be provided per each center’s standard practice guidelines and will be 
dictated by [CONTACT_781074]. There are no restrictions 
or limitations to supportive care measures. Some Fred Hutch guid elines are included in 
Appendix B . 
13. POST –HCT GROWTH FACTORS 
Regimen A: Bone Marrow or PBSC  - 
Patients who receive bone marrow or PBSC should in general not receive post -transplant  
growth factors during the first [ADDRESS_1073755] -transplant (ANC <500/ L). 
 
Regimen B: Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood – 
Patients who receive unrelated umbilical cord grafts will be started on G -CSF support at 
5mcg/kg (IV/SQ; round to vial size) daily starting day +[ADDRESS_1073756] 
blood infusion until ANC > 2500/μL for 2 consecutive days. Once a patient has met these 
criteria, the ANC will be monitored and G -CSF restarted if ANC falls to < 1000/ L. 
 
Note: We will not give G -CSF to those patients who receive both bone marrow and cord blood 
from an HLA -matched sibling donor.

weights (children <17 years – record height and weight every 3  months  
b) Weekly - CBC, BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, Alkaline phosphatase, Total bilirubin and  direct 
bilirubin. If stable, monthly evaluations as above for 2 years, then  annually  
c) Following discharge from the transplant center, we would like to track the patient’s medical 
condition for the rest of their life in conjunction with their primary care physician and the 
guidance of the Long -Term Follow -Up department.  
 
 
RECOMMENDED DISEASE STAGING TABLES  
 
Timing of studies: Post -transplant time points represent guidelines for recommended 
evaluations. Due to numerous factors influencing scheduling (patient and provider availability, 
testing services limitation, as well as other factors) variation in evaluati on performance dates is 
anticipated and acceptable to the protocol. The following is the recommendation; however, as 
stated above, we recognize that patients may follow up outside these windows (e.g., within +/ - 
7 days of time points < Day 100; +/ - 30 days  for time points > Day 100 to 1 year and +/ - 3 
months for time points > 1 year).

immunosuppression, reduced performance status, allergic reactions  (rare).  
2. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure (all 
rare).  
3. Dermatologic:  Alopecia,  rash.  
4. Gastro -intestinal: Mucositis, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, GI bleeding  (rare).  
5. Hematologic/Immunologic: Myelosuppression,  immunosuppression.  
6. Hepatic: Elevation of liver transaminases and/or bilirubin; rarely  ascites.  
7. Neurologic: P aresthesia, weakness or CNS demyelination (all rare).  
8. Ophthalmologic: Blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia (all rare).  
9. Pulmonary: Dyspnea or pneumonitis (all  rare).  
 
15C. Rabbit Anti -Thymocyte Globulin (Thymoglobulin®)  
 
1. Chills and Fever  
Chills and fever commonly occur in patients receiving Thymoglobulin®. Minor toxicities 
can usually be managed by [CONTACT_781078]. If during infusion the patient develops fever or chills or both, the patient shoul d 
be medicated with diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg I.V. (pediatric 1 mg/kg) and an 
antipyretic, e.g. acetaminophen, pediatric 10 -15 mg/kg/dose, max dose 650mg orally 
every 4 hours as needed. For severe fever and chills, meperidine 25 -50 mg (pediatric 1 
mg/kg) I. V. every 4 -6 hours as need may also be required.  
 
2. Pruritus  
Itching and erythema occasionally develop. Symptoms are generally controlled with 
diphenhydramine.  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020

3. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_781002] a sign of significant allergic re action or anaphylaxis. 
Infusion should be discontinued. If reaction persists, diphenhydramine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_781003].  
 
4. Hypotension  
Hypotension occurs rarely and may be a sign of significant allergic reaction or 
anaphylaxis. Discontinue infusion and treat accordingly.  
 
5. Serum  Sickness  
More common with ATGAM®, it is a syndrome of fever, arthralgias, and rash. Usually 
occurs with some delay after initial ATG administration. Treat with steroids.  
 
6. Leukopenia, Neutropenia, or  Thrombocytopenia  
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may initially occur. Leukopenia is the expected 
consequence of ATG, ATGAM ® therapy.  
 
7. Other  
Pain in chest, flank or back may be a sign of significant allergic reaction or anaphyla xis 
or hemolysis. Infusion should be discontinued. Further work up and therapy as clinically 
indicated.  
 
15D. TBI – Regimen B only  Unrelated Cord blood grafts  
 
TBI given at high doses in conventional transplants may cause nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, tempor ary hair loss, and painful swelling of the salivary glands for a few days. 
TBI may destroy normal bone marrow cells in addition to the cancer cells. *The doses of 
TBI (200 cGy and 300 cGy) used in this protocol is about one -sixth and one -fourth, 
respective ly, of that used in conventional transplant protocols, and severe acute side 
effects have so far not been observed. TBI has been associated with causing sterility 
and there is a risk of major genetic damage to any children conceived after 
transplantation. There is a risk that a small percentage of patients may develop a 
secondary cancer resulting from this treatment.  
 
15E. Toxicities associated with marrow/PBSC infusion  
The following are potential side effects associated with the transplant in general:  
 
1. Constitutional: Fever/chills, malaise, fatigue, headache, pain,  weakness.  
2. Cardiovascular: Edema, cardiac dysrhythmia, hypertension, thrombosis, cardiac 
failure.  
3. Dermatologic: Alopecia, rash, pruritus, skin depi[INVESTIGATOR_61367], 
photosensitivity.  
4. Gastro -intestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, dry  mouth.  
5. Hematologic/Immunologic: Myelosuppression, immunosuppression, 
infections/sepsis, hemorrhage, acute and chronic GVHD, graft  failure.  
6. Hepatic: Elevation of liver transaminases and/or bilirubin, VOD, hepatic  failure.  
7. Metabolic: Electrolyte abnormalities,  hype rglycemia.  
8. Neurologic: Dizziness, confusion, anxiety, depression; rarely seizures, 
encephalopathy,  demyelination.  
9. Pulmonary: Cough, dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis.  
10. Renal/Bladder: Elevation of BUN and/or creatinine, hemorrhagic cystitis,  renal 
failure.  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073788] blood infusion (both related and  
unrelated)  
Potential toxicities associated with the infusion include DMSO toxicity and side effects 
from red cells. DMSO toxicity and side effect of red cells may include changes in heart 
rate or rhythm, changes in blood pressure, fever, chills, sweats, nausea/vomiti ng, 
diarrhea, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], headache, allergic reaction, presence of DMSO taste 
and odor, hemoglobinuria, and acute renal failure.

a) Renal – Rise in serum creatinine, hemolytic uremic  syndrome.  
b) Neurological – Peripheral: paresthesia, tremo r. Central: seizures, 
headache, insomnia, dizziness, depression, confusion, hallucinations, 
psychosis, myoclonus, neuropathy, agitation.  
c) Gastrointestinal – Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea.  
d) Cardiovascular – Hypertension, myocardial  hypertrophy.  
e) Endocrine – Hyperglycemia, hyper/hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, 
hypomagnesemia.  
f) Integument – Itching,  rash.  
g) Hematologic – Leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, 
PTLD, thrombotic  microangiopathy.  
h) Liver – Abnormal liver function  tests.  
i) Ocular – Blurred vision,  photophobia.  
j) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – Pleural effusion, atelectasis, cough,  dyspnea.  
k) Musculoskeletal – Arthralgias . 
 
2. Methotrexate  
Toxicities: In this setting, mucositis is the primary toxicity related to methotrexate. In 
the setting of renal or hepatic dysfunction, where there is impaired clearance of the 
medication, methotrexate may contribute to delayed neutrophil engr aftment.  
Methotrexate may cause an elevation in serum transaminase.  
 
Regimen B: Unrelated umbilical cord blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
 
3. Cyclosporine  
See section 11 for information about administration and dosage adjustments. Side 
effects are generally reversible, and m ay include renal insufficiency, 
hypomagnesemia, paresthesias, tremor, seizures, visual disturbances, paresis, 
disorientation, depression, confusion, somnolence, coma, nausea, hypertension, 
hemolytic -uremic syndrome, hyperglycemia, gynecomastia, and hypertr ichosis. (See 
Standard Practice Manual)  
 
4. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) – See section 11 for information about 
administration and dosage  adjustments.  
 
a) Description  
MMF is the morpholinylethylester of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and reversibly 
inhibits inosine mono phosphate dehydrogenase, particularly the type II isoform that  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
43  
  
 
is more prominent in activated lymphocytes. As a result of the inhibition of de novo 
purine synthesis, proliferation of B and T lymphocytes is blocked and antibody 
production is inhibited.  
 
b) Storage and  Administration  
MMF is available in an oral and an intravenous formulation. The oral formulation is 
supplied in 250mg hard gelatin capsules and can be stored at room temperature. 
MMF for IV administration is supplied as a lyophilized powder in a glass vial 
containing the equivalent of 500mg.  
 
c) Side Effects and  Toxicity  
Precautions: MMF has been studied extensively among patients after 
nonmyeloablative HCT. Previous clinical studies in patients after allografting 
suggest that the principal adverse reactions associated with t he administration of 
MMF include nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, diarrhea, and on one occasion 
bloody diarrhea. In the setting of marrow transplantation, several etiologic factors 
may contribute to alterations in gastrointestinal and hematologic parameters.  
MMF has an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including GI 
tract ulceration, and hemorrhage (3% of patients receiving MMF). GI tract 
perforations have rarely been observed. Most patients in these studies were also 
on other drugs known  to be associated with these complications. Up to 2% of 
patients receiving MMF for prevention of rejection developed severe neutropenia 
(ANC <500). The development of neutropenia may be related to MMF itself, 
concomitant medications, viral infections or so me combination of these causes.  
MMF dose adjustments will be made if clinically indicated if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_660742], no other cause is thought to be responsible for the 
abnormality. These adjustments should be discussed with the principa l 
investigator and documented in the medical records and the clinical reporting form 
(CRF).  
 
16. EBV Monitoring and  Treatment  
Patients will have EBV by [CONTACT_781079] a week until day [ADDRESS_1073789].  
 
A) Patients who develop a viral load of > 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_781005], evaluation by [CONTACT_781080]/or therapy as  per institutional standards and Infectious Disease 
recommendations.  
B) If the patient  develops  increasing  viral load,  it is suggested  that he or she be treated  with either 
preemptive Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV weekly x 4 weeks or an EBV reactivation protocol 
according to local institution practice and ID recommendation. It is suggested that subjects 
who develop  EBV reactivation  and/or  asymptomatic  increasing  viral load by [CONTACT_781081], abdomen, and pelvis to 
assess the development of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, or other evidence of the 
development  of PTLD.  Whenever  possible,  the clinical  diagnosis  of PTLD  should  be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_515645].  
 
17. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
17A. Monitoring the Progress of Trials and the Safety of  Participants  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
44  
  
 
The principal investigators (PI) monitor multi -institutional clinical trials, wi th oversight by [CONTACT_5134], a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_781006].  
 
This mul ti-center protocol has a DSMB responsible for monitoring patient safety by [CONTACT_781082]. The DSMB meets twice a year and all outcome data is 
reviewed including all adverse events reported to the coordinating center (FHCRC) a long with 
those officially reported to the FHCRC IRO. The DSMB confirms that the trial has not met any 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781007]. 
A report from the DSMB is submitted to the FHCRC IRB, the IND sponsor, the DSMC Chairman, 
Protocol Office, and the trial coordinators/local PIs of this protocol. The DSMB will discontinue 
the review  of outcomes  when  this protocol  is closed  to accrual.  Furthermore,  the FHCRC  also has 
a DSMC that reviews the progress of the protocol with respect to the monitoring plan at the time 
of each annual renewal. As with initial review, annual IRB review and approval is also  required.  
 
Flow of information concerning clinical trial participant s originates with the clinicians and nurses 
in the clinic or referring clinicians at other institutions and is transmitted to the FHCRC Trial 
Coordinator. At the FHCRC, health care providers and rotating attending physicians assess 
patients and record thei r observations regarding toxicity and response outcomes in the medical 
record.  Thus,  multiple  health  care providers  provide  independent  observations  and participate  in 
monitoring this trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_443875] a clinician for some patients entered on this trial . However, 
assessments are the sum total of the primary health care provider (fellow or physician 
assistant), floor or outpatient nurse and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_781008] a s the attending clinician for protocol 
patients. If determination of adverse events is controversial, co -investigators will convene on an 
ad hoc basis as necessary to review the primary data and render a  decision.  
 
17B. Adverse Event Definitions  
 
a. Adverse  Event  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with study drug administr ation or usage. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medici nal product.  
 
b. Serious Adverse  Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that results in 
any of the following outcomes:  
• Death.  
• Life-threatening situation (ie, with an immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurr ed but not including an event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might 
have caused  death).  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283635] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_781009], for any 
length of time, whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283636]. However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283637], procedures required by [CONTACT_17143], or tumor -related diagnostic procedures are not considered  serious.  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
45  
  
 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life  functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
• An important medical event that requires intervention to prevent one of the  above 
outcomes.  
 
c. Unexpected Adverse  Event  
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an event that has a nature or severity, or frequency 
that is not consistent with the applicable investigator brochure. “Unexpected,” as used in this 
definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed and 
reported rather than an experience that has not been anticipated based on the pharmacological 
properties of the study drug.  
17C.  Monitoring and recording  AEs 
 
Adverse events will be collected and graded using the modified (for HCT) NCI Common 
Toxicity Criteria ( Appendix G of the protocol ). All grade 3 and 4 adverse events (or highly 
unusual grade 2 adverse events), which occur from the start of study treatment (pre -transplant 
conditioning) through day [ADDRESS_1073790] -transplant, will be assessed by [CONTACT_781083], whether or not attributed to the study intervention. Adverse 
events that occur between the start of conditioning and day 30 will be assessed separately to 
identify early regimen related toxicities.  The investigator should attempt to establish a 
diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, symptoms and/or other clini cal information. In such 
cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the adverse event and/or serious adverse event 
and not described as the individual signs or symptoms. The following information should be 
recorded:  
• Description of the adverse event using  concise medical  terminology  
• Description as to whether or not the adverse event is  serious  
• The start date (date of adverse event  onset)  
• The stop date (date of adverse event  resolution)  
• The severity (grade) of the adverse  event  
• A description of the potential relatedness of the adverse event to study drug or a study 
procedure  
• The action taken due to the adverse  event  
• The outcome of the adverse  event  
 
The adverse event reporting in this multi -institution clinical trial will follow both the sponsor and 
IRB guidelines for serious adverse event (SAE) reporting. The classification of an adverse event 
determines what reporting procedure to follow for reporting the adverse event. (See Table 2 
and 3). 
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
46  
  
 
17D: Grading of the severity of an Adverse Event  
 
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE criteria. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, 
the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 
3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening), or Grade 5 (fatal) to des cribe the maximum intensity of the 
adverse  event.  
 
Attribution of Adverse Event  
 
Association or relatedness to the study agent will be assessed by [CONTACT_3470]:  
 
• Definite: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the  
investigational agent, has been previously described in association with the  investigational 
agent, and cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors such as the patient’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications; AND the event 
disappears or improves with withdrawal of the investigational agent and/or re -appears on 
re-exposure (e.g., in the event of an infusion  reaction).  
• Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the 
investigational age nt and has been previously been described in association with the 
investigational agent OR cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors such as the 
patient’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant  medications.  
• Possible: The even t follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the 
investigational agent, but could be attributable to other factors such as the patient’s  clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications.  
• Unlikely: Toxicity is doubtful ly related to the investigational agent(s). The event may be 
attributable to other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions or concomitant  medications.  
• Unrelated: The event is clearly related to other factors such as th e patient’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions or concomitant  medications.  
 
For general AE assessment, an AE is considered related if it is assessed as definitely, probably, 
or possibly related; unrelated if it is assessed as unlikely related or unrelated. For determination 
of IND safety reporting, AE attribution will be assessed according to the suspected adverse 
reaction definition described in 21 CFR 312.32 as an AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event where “reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relatio nship between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse 
reactions that are both serious and unexpected will be reported to the FDA as an IND safety 
report, in accordance with regulations under 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
17E: Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
All grade 3 a nd 4 adverse events (or highly unusual grade 2 adverse events), which occur from 
the start of study treatment (pre -transplant conditioning) through day [ADDRESS_1073791] -transplant, or when any ongoing drug -related adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events have resolved or become stable. A subject withdrawn from the study because of 
an adverse event must b e followed until the clinical outcome from the adverse event is 
determined.  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
47  
  
 
All adverse events reportable to the IRB will be collected according to current reporting FHCRC 
IRB Policies for Reportable Events. Definitions, instructions and fo rms associated with 
reportable events can be found on the FHCRC’s Institutional Review Office (IRO) extranet 
website: http://extranet.fhcrc.org/EN/sections/iro/irb/ae.html . All invest igators must report 
adverse events to their respective IRB as locally mandated . 
 
All events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_781010] (1) unexpected, and (2) related or possibly related 
to the research and (3) serious or suggest that the research places research participants or 
others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was previously known or 
recognized will be submitted to the IRB within 10 calendar days (see Tables 2, 3, and 4 below). 
In addition, all serious adverse events are reported to the IRB at the time of annual renewal. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a study is responsible for this reporting and the IRO assures adverse event reporting on 
an annual basis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_781011]. Furthe rmore, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781012]. All collaborating PIs have fulfilled all NIH 
requirements for training in human subject’s  protection.  
 
The FHCRC PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] r esearch staff will meet regularly to review all reported events. If the event 
meets FHCRC IRB current reporting obligations, it will be sent to the FHCRC IRB. After the 
FHCRC IRB has reviewed the event report it will be disseminated to all participating 
sites/investigators, the DSMB, and the study sponsor.  
 
When a patient experiences disease recurrence or graft failure and goes on to further treatment 
off protocol, adverse events will no longer be collected with the exception of death.  
 
Patients enrolled in this study are receiving treatments that are general ly associated with high 
rates of expected adverse events (outlined in Appendix I ). 
 
17.F. Reporting to Coordinating Center and Fred Hutch IRB  
 
For patients being cared for at the FHCRC, heath care providers communicate with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_781013]. For patients not being cared 
for at the FHCRC the outside facilities communicate with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_781014].  
 
As FHCRC is the coordinating center, all reportable events will be collected by [CONTACT_781084] 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study staff for submission to FHCRC IRB. All reportable events should be submitted to 
the coordinating center  on the relevant FHCRC IRB forms. (See Tables 2 and 3 for FHCRC 
IRB Reporting Policies and Forms for Reporting)

17.G Research Site Reporting Requirements to Sponsor  
 
Classification of an event as serious or non -serious determines the reporting procedures to 
be followed by [CONTACT_781085].  
 
The information in the Institution -Sponsored IND SAE Reporting Form ( see Appendix E ) 
must match or be reconciled with the information recorded in the adverse events section of 
the CRF and study database. For example, the same adverse event term should be used on 
both forms.  
 
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor from the time of study drug administra tion until 
SAE duration as outlined in the protocol. SAEs that occur after the study -specific informed 
consent is signed but prior to the first dose of the investigational agent will be collected only if 
they are considered by [CONTACT_781086]. SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_781015] 4 .

17H: FHCRC Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
 
The sponsor assumes responsibility for IND safety reporting to the FDA and participating 
investigators, in accordance with regulations under 21 CFR 312.32.  
Each serious adverse event report received from the investigator will be evaluated by [CONTACT_781088] (see Section 17B.b), the expectedness of the 
event (see Section 17.B.c), and the relationship to participation in the study (see Section 17.D). For 
regulatory reporting purposes, the Sponsor will determine  expectedness relating to treosulfan 
using safety information specified in the treosulfan investigator brochure. An event will be classified 
as related if either the investigator or the Sponsor determines that the event may be related to the 
study drug.  
 
The Sponsor or its designee will provide all investigators with a safety letter notifying them of an 
event that meets FDA IND Safety Reporting criteria. Investigators will be requested to provide 
written notification of safety report to the FHCRC IRB as soo n as is practical, consistent with IRB 
requirements.  
 
17I. Plans for Assuring that any Action Resulting in a Temporary or Permanent Suspension 
of an NCI -funded Clinical Trial is Reported to the NCI Grant Program Director Responsible 
for the grant  
This clin ical research trial is associated with an Investigational New Drug (IND). Any temporary or 
permanent suspension, as determined by [CONTACT_978], IRB, IND Sponsor, or DSMC, of this clinical 
research trial will be reported to the NCI grant program director by [CONTACT_941] P I. 
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/2020  
50  
  
 
17J. Plans for Assuring Data Accuracy and Protocol Compliance  
The study has dedicated research staff who follow patients to confirm eligibility; reporting of 
adverse events; reporting of events, which are part of the safety -monitoring pl an, and protocol 
adherence. The PI, data coordinators, and research staff are responsible for review and 
maintenance of all patient records to ensure data integrity and protocol adherence.  
 
At the FHCRC, health care providers and rotating attending physici ans assess patients and record 
their observations in the medical record. This documentation is extracted by [CONTACT_781089] (CRF’s). The study staff also 
continue to follow patients aft er day 100, review source documentation, and complete CRFs at 6 
months, 1 year, 1.5 years, and then annually per protocol. The CRFs are printed directly from the 
database, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_781016]. Afte r 
the CRFs are verified, they are signed by [CONTACT_978]. Thus, multiple health care providers provide 
independent observations and participate in assessments on this trial.  
 
Outside center clinical trial participant’s information is transmitted to the FHCRC Tri al Coordinator. 
Clinical outcome data are summarized and transmitted from collaborating centers as CRFs. CRFs 
from external sites are verified and signed by [CONTACT_781090]. The CRFs are 
generated from the collaborating centers at prot ocol defined time points. When possible, primary 
source documents regarding patient outcomes are collected with patients’ names removed and 
replaced by [CONTACT_443958] (UPNs). The data are incorporated into a central database by 
[CONTACT_58047]. Co llaborating sites send signed consents, eligibility forms, and CRFs with 
source documents demonstrating eligibility, treatment, and serious adverse events (if applicable) to 
the study staff. These are reviewed for eligibility, adherence to the protocol, ac curacy, and 
completeness by [CONTACT_5984].  
 
The study is monitored under the FHCRC Monitoring Plan. The FHCRC Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan details the full scope and extent of monitoring and provides for immediate action in 
the event of the discovery of major deviations.  
 
18. RECORDS  
Clinical records will be maintained as confidentially as possible by [CONTACT_443953]. 
Data will be collected from the collaborating institutions and will be maintained by [CONTACT_278814]. 
The investigator will ensure that data collected conform to all established guidelines for coding, 
collection, key entry and verification. Each patient is assigned a unique patient number to assure 
patient confidentiality. Any publication or presentation will refer to patients by [CONTACT_781091]. The licensed medical records department, affiliated with the institution where the patient 
receives medical care, maintains all original inpatient and outpatient chart documents. Patient 
research files are kept in a locked room. They are maintained by  [CONTACT_781092], 
which is supervised by [CONTACT_1629] A.R.T. Access is restricted to personnel authorized by [CONTACT_781093] . 
 
19. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND TERMINATION OF  STUDY  
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to ev aluate, within the limits of a phase II study, the 
preliminary efficacy as defined by [CONTACT_781044], of a regimen consisting of treosulfan and 
fludarabine followed by [CONTACT_781045]. We plan 
to enroll at leas t 30 patients on this study. A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled onto Arm A. 
The protocol will continue to accrue until this goal is met. There will be no set limit for Arm B: the 
cord blood arm. Analyses will be carried out separately between Arm A and B. We will be 
encouraged to continue study of this treatment if at least 27 of 30 patients engraft. Table 5 shows 
the probability of observing 27 or more successes among 30 patients for several possible true 
rates of engraftment.  
FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073792] 13 patients (5/13 = 38%; 3/8 bone 
marrow recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 2/[ADDRESS_1073793] blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) the protocol was modifi ed to add rabbit ATG 
(thymoglobulin) to both arms initially for unrelated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (January 2011) and subsequently for 
the related recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (September 2011). In addition, due to graft rejection (n=1) and low donor 
chimerism/inadequate disease response (n=1) in [ADDRESS_1073794] 30 patients as  of 
January 2011, with a minimum enrollment of 30 onto Regimen A (as stated above). The efficacy 
analysis will be performed separately for the initial 13 patients (Regimen A: n=8, Regimen B: n=5) 
and those accrued under the modified regimen. Only patients enrolled after this protocol 
modification will be counted towards the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
 
Table 5. Probability of observing 27 or more successes in 30 patients  
True rate of engraftment   
Pr(≥ 27 successes)

80% 0.12 
90% 0.65 
95% 0.94 
 
The incidence of day 200 transplant -related mortality (TRM) will be monitored in all patients. If 
there is sufficient evidence suggesting that the true incidence of day 200 TRM exceeds 25% on 
either arm, enrollment on that arm will be suspended and the DSM B will be convened to make 
recommendations regarding protocol modification. Sufficient evidence will be an observed rate of 
day 200 TRM that corresponds to a one -sided 80% confidence interval with a lower limit greater 
than 25%. These limits will be examin ed after every 5th enrolled patient becomes eligible for 
evaluation. In practice, the study arm will be suspended if we observe the following number of 
TRM in study patients: 3/5, 5/10, 6/15, 8/20, 9/25, 10/30, 12/35, 13/40, 15/45 or 16/50 per disease 
subg roup per study arm (Regimen A versus Regimen B). Table 6 summarizes the operating 
characteristics of this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], for enrollment of up to 50 patients per disease subgroup per 
study arm (Regimen A versus Regimen B) as estimated from 5,000 Monte Carlo  simulations. We 
will apply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781017] A and B separately.  
 
The protocol related to regimen B was modified in April 2012. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781018] 200 
TRM were met in October 2011 due to 3 deaths occurring in the 5 patients enrolled si nce the 
January 2011 protocol modifications (1 due to multi -system organ failure; 1 due to ARDS/diffuse 
alveolar damage; and 1 due to gram positive sepsis (strep viridans) with multi -system organ failure, 
questioned possible sinusoidal obstructive syndrome /veno -occlusive disease). All deaths occurred 
before day 100, with two very early on post -transplant day [ADDRESS_1073795] met and revi ewed the data and recommended the following: The revised protocol will allow 
up to 5 more patients to be enrolled on regimen B before reconvening the DSMB, with each patient

The incidence of graft rejection will also be monitored in all patients. Regimen A and B will be 
monitored/analyzed separately. If there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the true incidence of 
graft rejection exceeds within the first 365 days 10% on e ither arm, enrollment will be suspended 
on that arm and the DSMB will be convened to make recommendations regarding protocol 
modification and/or dose escalation. Sufficient evidence will be an observed rate of graft rejection 
that corresponds to a one -sided 80% confidence interval with a lower limit greater than 10%.  
These limits will be examined after every 5th enrolled patient becomes eligible for evaluation. In 
practice, the study arm will be suspended if we observe the following number of graft rejectio ns in 
study patients: 2/5, 3/10, 3/15, 4/20, 5/25, 5/30, 6/35, 7/40, 7/45 or 8/50 per disease subgroup per 
study arm (Regimen A versus Regimen B). Table 7 summarizes the operating characteristics of 
this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781023] 50 patients pe r disease subgroup, as estimated from 
5,000 Monte Carlo simulations.

Day 100 Grade III/IV GVHD >15% for Arm A +rATG PBSC grafts 2/5, 3/10, 4/15, 5/20, 6/25, 7/30, 
8/35, 9/40, 10/45, or 11/[ADDRESS_1073796] experienced poor engraftment. Therefore the original dose of treosulfan 
was reinstituted in April 2014. The protocol accrual will continue to a total of 60 patients in Arm  A 
with Treosulfan/Fludarabine/rATG, so as to ensure adequate numbers of smaller children will be 
treated at the original dose, since among the original 30 patients only a small number were <0.[ADDRESS_1073797] 30 patie nts in Arm A will be applied separately to the additional 30 
patients in Arm A; however, accrual to Arm B will continue as before under the same stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37626].  
 
In October/November 2015 Regimen A of the protocol was modified to increase accrual to a 
minim um of 20 patients for each subgroup of patients (for example, primary immunodeficiency 
diseases, hemophagocytic disorders, hemoglobinopathies, and marrow failure disorders) who 
receive Treosulfan, fludarabine, and rabbit ATG. The protocol will continue to accrue until a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1073798] blood from the same HLA -matched 
sibling donor will be enrolled onto Regimen A of the protocol and analyzed with this  group.  
 
In March 2018, the protocol was modified to prioritize PBSC (Regimen A) a s the preferred stem 
cell source when feasible. This change was made with the goal of improving donor chimerism. 
PBSC has a higher risk of graft versus host disease; therefore, a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781026] -IV 
GVHD will be added to the protocol – Regimen A  only. Since bone marrow will still be allowed on 
Regimen A, we will apply this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781027]. If there is sufficient evidence to 
suggest that the true incidence of grade III -IV GVHD at day 100 exceeds 15% (Regimen A), 
enrollment will b e suspended on that arm and the DSMB will be convened to make 
recommendations regarding protocol modification. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781028] 2 of 5, 3 
of 10, 4 of 15, 5 of 20, 6 of 25, 7 of 30, 8 of 35, 9 of 40, 10 of 45, or 11 of 50 experience g rade III -IV 
GVHD. This stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_781029].  The 
current PBSC transplants on the protocol will be included in this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37595].

81 FHCRC 2256.00  Current version: 04/06/[ADDRESS_1073821] disease: GVHD is a major toxicity associated with the infusion of allogeneic donor stem 
cells.  GVHD  may be acute  or chronic  and may affect  multiple  organ  systems,  including  the skin, liver,  and GI 
tract.  
 
2. Opportunistic  infections,  including  viral and fungal  infections,  can result  in severe  pulmonary,  neurologic, 
hepatic and other organ dysfunction, and possible  death.  
 
3. Gastrointestinal toxicity. Nausea and vomiting can be anticipated during the entire course of ablative 
therapy. Mucositis and diarrhea should be expected. Prednisone can cause GI  bleeding.  
 
4. Cardiac toxicity. Cardiotoxicity (congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, EKG changes) is 
uncomm only associated  with the chemotherapy  agents and  TBI used  in the regimen  and these  sequelae 
may prove lethal.  
 
5. Pulmonary toxicity. Diffuse interstitial pneumonitis of unknown etiology and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage 
occur with some regularity after BMT and interstitial fibrosis occurs much more rarely. Both are well - 
described complications of intensive chemotherap y and TBI regimens and may prove  lethal.  
 
6. Hepatic toxicity. Veno -occlusive disease of the liver is a common toxicity of high -dose 
chemoradiotherapy  and may result  in death.  Tacrolimus/Cyclosporine  may cause  elevation  of ALT/AST.  
 
7. Renal dysfunction. Chemoradiotherapy may uncommonly cause renal dysfunction. More commonly, 
nephrotoxicity results from cyclosporine/tacrolimus and generally responds to dose reduction. Rarely, 
idiopathic  or calcineurin  inhibitor -associated  hemolytic -uremi c syndrome  may occur  and may be progressive 
and fatal. A syndrome of moderate renal insufficiency and hemolysis has been seen [ADDRESS_1073822] 
development  is possible  after TBI and/or  steroids.  Deficiencies of  growth  hormone,  thyroid  hormone,  and sex 
hormones are possible following conditioning. Calcineurin inhibitors can cause transient gingival hyperplasia, 
tremor, seizure, hypertension, headache, dysesthesia and hirsutism. Steroid therapy can also contribute to 
fluid retention, easy bruising, hy pertension, aseptic necrosis of bone and increased susceptibility to infection. 
MMF can cause spontaneous abortions and birth defects. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_781039].

Version: 27-JULY -2016  Confidential: Property of The Ocular Surface Research Institute  Page [ADDRESS_66414] lens disco ntinuation and dropout rates are estimated to be as 
high as 15.9% in the [LOCATION_002].[ADDRESS_66415] lens and inadequate lubrication on the surface of the eye. 
This is further exacerbated if the patient has an already unstable lipid layer due to the presence 
of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is considered by [CONTACT_61543], and is a chronic and progressive condition that can 
contribute to a poor quality lipid layer and lead to contact [CONTACT_61544].[ADDRESS_66416]; however, the 
results of the different methods can vary based on the heating method, how long the compress is 
applied, and whether the compress remains hot for the duration of application. Because of the 
sometimes seemingly ineffectiveness of the therapy due to variation in methods and no accepted 
standard, patient compliance for home therapy often wanes and further reduces the likelihood of 
successful treatment. Therefore, t he purpose of this study is to assess the potential benefits of 
using the Bruder Moist Heat Compress , a warm compress capable of maintain heat effectively,  in 
contact [CONTACT_61545].  
Study Design & Endpoints  
This will be a prospective , three -arm, randomized controlled  study  to evaluate the benefits of 
using the Bruder Moist Heat Compress in co ntact lens wearers who report red uced comfortable 
wearing time by [CONTACT_61546]. All subjects will undergo  examination 
to determine eligibility and capture baseline status. Study endpoints will be evaluated after one 
month.  
Thirty  adults who currently wear contact [CONTACT_13276], who report reduced contact [CONTACT_61547].  Subjects will be randomized to either one of two treatment arms or a 
control arm with approximately ten subjects per group ; that is, subjects will be randomized to one 
of the following study arms:  
Version: 27-JULY -2016  Confidential: Property of The Ocular Surface Research Institute  Page 3 of 5 1) Application of Bruder Moist Heat Compress twice daily  for one month (ten minute 
application in the morning prior to contact [CONTACT_61548])  
2) Application of Bruder Moist Heat Compress once daily  for one month (ten minute 
application in the evening after l ens removal)  
3) Application of warm wash cloth twice  daily (ten minute application each time)  for one 
month  (control group)  
Subjects will be seen for three  study visits  over a period of four weeks according to the following 
visit schedule :  
 Visit 1 (Screening  & Randomization , Day 1 ) 
 Visit 2 ( Day 15 ± 2 days)  
 Visit 3 (Final Visit,  Day 29 ± 1 day ) 
The procedures to be performed during the visits include:  
1. Questionnaires: CLDEQ long form, SPEED, OSDI  
2. Medical and Ophthalmic History   
3. Habitual visual acuity with contact [CONTACT_13276]  
4. Contact [CONTACT_61549]   
5. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_61541]  
6. Slit lamp examination  
7. Tear film break up time  
8. Corneal Staining  
9. MG assessment  
10. Meibography  
11. Corneal Topography  
Each visit will take approximately [ADDRESS_66417] lenses. Subjects  will heat the 
compress according to the instructions on the package, namely: heat for twenty -five seconds  in 
the microwave , and depending on the microwave wattage increase by [CONTACT_61550] a total of thirty -five seconds. Once heated, subjects will apply the compress to 
closed eyelids for ten minutes. During the treatment period, subjects will complete a daily diary 
that captures insertion and removal time of contact [CONTACT_13276] , as well as the time comfortable contact 
[CONTACT_61551]. Diaries will also be used to ensure subject compliance of application of the Bruder 
compress.  
Study Objectives  
Primary  Objective: To show that daily application of the Bruder Moist Heat Compress in 
subjects with MGD who experience CL discomfort can result in an increase in 
comfortable contact [CONTACT_61552]: To compare the efficacy of once daily applic ation of the Bruder 
Moist Heat Compress versus twice daily application  
Version: 27-JULY -2016  Confidential: Property of The Ocular Surface Research Institute  Page 4 of 5 Tertiary  Objective: To show that the Bruder Moist Heat Compress is an effective 
treatment for improving meibomian gland function in symptomatic contact [CONTACT_61553]:  Mean change from baseline in the duration of subject -reported comfortable 
contact [CONTACT_61554] (hours per day) at the week four visit  
Secondary : Mean change in comfortable contact [CONTACT_61555]  (hours per day)  in twice 
daily application  group compared to once daily application  group  
Tertiary : Mean change in total meibomian gland score in treatment groups using the 
Bruder Moist Heat Compress compared to controls  from baseline to four weeks

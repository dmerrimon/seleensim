Title:  The Effect of Physical Activity Promotion on Short and Long -term     
             Outcomes in COPD  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_452466] L. Moy, MD, MSc  
 
 (1)  Rationale  
 
(a) Statement of the Problem.    
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major cause of global morbidity, is 
projected to become the third leading cause of death in the world by 2020.  In Veterans, the 
prevalence is high; in VISN1 in FY 2012, 9% of outpatient Veterans had the ICD -9 diagnosis of 
COPD.  In COPD, shortness of breath leads to physical inactivity and significant functional 
impairment and disability.  The clinical course is characterized by [CONTACT_700513] (AEs), 
periods of worsening that require additional pharmacological treatment.  From 2002 to 2005, there 
were over 40,000 admissions to VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700462].  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_700463] -related quality of life (HRQL ), a more rapid longitudinal decline in forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_700464] (FEV 1), and higher mortality.  Furthermore, there is considerable 
evidence that COPD is a systemic disease.  P ersons with COPD have elevated biomarkers of 
systemic inflamm ation,  such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin -6 (IL -6), which are 
associated with increased risks of AEs, cardiovascular disease, peripheral skeletal muscle 
dysfunction, and all -cause mortality.   
A growing body of knowledge has identified physical activity and exercise as a modifiable 
factor that may impact COPD -related morbidity and mortality.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_176880] -
sectional studies have shown that persons with COPD who are more physically ac tive have fewer 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700465].  Specifically, walking is a simple and meaningful metric of 
physical activity associated with COPD outcomes.  Funded by a RR&D CDA -1 ([CONTACT_452523]), we have 
shown that daily step count can be accurately meas ured in persons with COPD and provides 
unique information about COPD clinical status not captured by [CONTACT_700514] (FEV 1), symptom of dyspnea, HRQL, or  6-minute walk test  (6MWT) distance, a clinic -
based test of exercise capacity.  Importantly, we have shown that persons with COPD who walk 
the most have the lowest risk of future AEs and the lowest plasma levels of CRP and IL -6.  Others 
have shown that a higher daily step count is associated with lower mortality in COPD, independent 
of lung function.    
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_58009], there have been few interventions to increase walking in 
persons with COPD.  Counseling by [CONTACT_700515].  Although supervised p ulmonary rehabilitation programs 
improve exercise capacity, they are not accessible to all who could benefit from them and have 
low adherence rates.  Novel interventions that incorporate strategies for behavioral change and 
that are accessible, individuali zed, and sustained are needed to promote physical activity and 
exercise in persons limited by [CONTACT_700516].  Funded by a RR&D CDA -2 ([CONTACT_452523]), we have developed 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a novel exercise intervention that combines a website  with a pedometer to promote 
walking i n persons with COPD.  The program , called Every Step Counts (ESC) for Lung Health, 
accurately monitors walking, provides iterative feedback and individualized goal -setting in steps 
per day, and delivers education and motivation online.  In a non -randomized  study, we 
demonstrated its safety, feasibility, and ability to increase daily step count in persons with COPD 
over 3 months.   
Building on the CDA -1 and CDA -2, we propose to determine the efficacy of an internet -
mediated walking program  compared to usual care (verbal and written instructions to exercise).  
We propose a 2 -arm randomized, controlled study (1:1 ratio) in up to 185 persons with COPD.

 Subjects will participat e in the study for a total of up to 13 months.  T he intensive interventional 
phase will be  6 months  during which subjects will be engaged by [CONTACT_700517], tips, 
an online forum community, and step count goals  followed by a  maintenance intervention  phase 
of 6 months  during which the subjects will receive new step count goals but no new educational 
material s; although  subjects will be able to review content previously posted. Subjects will wear 
the pedometer for [ADDRESS_950887]’s birthday month (no specific day listed) as 
well as a postcard  during each season  (spring, summer, fall,  winter) with health a nd safety tips to 
enhance  study engagement . 
 
 (b)  Hypotheses or Key Question.    
Primary Aim :  To determine the efficacy of the WEB  intervention to increase 6MWT 
distance.  
 
Secondary Aims :  To estimate the effect of the WEB  intervention on (a) HRQL, as 
measured by [CONTACT_6016]. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ), (b) dyspnea, (c) CRP and IL -
6, (d) risk of AEs and COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], (e) engagement in physical activity as 
measured by [CONTACT_700518] , and (f) to measure changes in body composi tion and bone mineral 
density (BMD) in a subset of participants . 
 
 (c)  Specific Objectives.    
We hypothesize that WEB  will significantly increase exercise capacity measured by 6MWT 
distance at [ADDRESS_950888] of those interventions on 
COPD outcomes.  Our intervention has the potential to (1) bring an exercise program to the vast 
majority of persons with COPD who cannot go to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based pulmonary rehabilitation 
program, (2) improv e the effectiveness of current rehabilitation programs by [CONTACT_700519] -term 
exercise, and (3) become an effective and integral part of COPD self -management programs.  
Ultimately, the intervention could decrease risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], AEs, and COPD -related 
morbidity and mortality.  
 
 (2)  Background and Significance  
 
 (a)  Background.    
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a major cause of global morbidity, is projected 
to become the third leading cause of death in the world by 2020 (1).  In Veterans, the prevalence 
is high (2); in VISN1 in FY 2012, 9% of outpatient Veterans had the ICD -9 diagnosis of COPD.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_700466], shortness of breath (dyspnea) is a common 
symptom, leading to physical inactivity, deconditioning, and significant functional impairment and 
disability (3).  The clinical course  of COPD is characterized by [CONTACT_566905] (AEs), periods 
of worsening that require treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids (4).  AEs result in negative

 effects on health -related quality of life (HRQL), a more rapid longitudinal decline in for ced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV 1), and higher mortality (5,6).  AEs contribute to 31 -68% of 
the $6.5 billion/year cost of health care for COPD patients in the US (5,7).  From 2002 to 2005, 
there were over 40,000 admissions to VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700467] (8).  COPD is not 
only a lung disease, but also a systemic disease (9).  P ersons with COPD have elevated 
circulating biomarkers of inflammation,  such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin -6 (IL-6), 
which are associated with increased r isks of AEs, cardiovascular disease, peripheral skeletal 
muscle dysfunction, and all -cause mortality (10 -12). 
COPD is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular and oncologic comorbidities 
(13).  As in the general population, physical activity (PA ) may be important in modifying risk of 
these comorbid conditions in persons with COPD.  Furthermore, exercise capacity, measured by 
[CONTACT_700520] (VO 2 max) during a cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance test 
(CPETT) or distance walked on a [ADDRESS_950889] (6MWT), is a significant predictor of mortality, 
independent of lung function in COPD (14,15).  In addition to exercise capacity measured with 
clinic -based tests, PA measured in the field is significantly reduced in persons with COPD, 
compared to healthy subjects (16,17).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_176880] -sectional studies of PA, 
assessed by [CONTACT_700521], have shown that PA relates to out comes in 
COPD.  Adjusting for % predicted FEV 1, higher levels of PA are associated with better functional 
status, fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], and lower mortality (18 -21).  One study has shown that higher 
PA is associated with lower fibrinogen levels, an inf lammatory biomarker, suggesting that 
increased PA may be associated with decreased systemic inflammation (22).  Thus, PA may be 
a modifiable factor that impacts risk of comorbidities and COPD -related morbidity and mortality.  
Current COPD treatment guideli nes state “it should be considered a high priority for future COPD 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_700468]" (23 -24).  Engagement in PA is an integral component of COPD 
self-management programs (25).  
Walking is a simple form of PA and exercise that most people c an do.  It is generally a 
safe, convenient, and inexpensive way to increase PA, and it can be integrated into daily activities -
-all factors that contribute to long -term adherence.  Steps per day is an easy to understand activity 
unit and goals to increase walking by a certain number of steps per day are meaningful to 
subjects.  We and others have shown a low correlation between daily step counts and measures 
of exercise capacity such as 6MWT distance and VO 2 max, demonstrating that daily step counts 
capture  unique information (40,41).  Total daily PA is closely related to leg activity in persons with 
COPD (42).  Depew et al. have shown that daily step count is a surrogate for PA level (43).  Higher 
levels of walking are associated with better outcomes in COP D.  Regular walkers, defined as 
those who are active on most days or every single day of the week, have slower declines in overall 
HRQL and less progression of dyspnea during activities of daily living compared to irregular 
walkers with COPD (32). A 6 -mont h home -based exercise program focused on walking improved 
6MWT distance and HRQL (44).  As part of [CONTACT_452523]’s CDA -[ADDRESS_950890] shown that a 
higher daily step count is associated with a lower risk of future AEs and COPD -related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (45).   We have also shown that those who walk the most have the lowest plasma 
levels of CRP and IL -6 (see Preliminary Studies).  Others have shown that a higher daily step 
count is associated with lower mortality in COPD, independent of pulmonary function (19).   A 
plausible hypothesis is that daily step counts and PA affect systemic inflammation which, in turn, 
impacts risk of AEs, COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and death in persons with COPD.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_58009], there have been few exercise interv entions to increase 
walking in persons with COPD.  The Internet can be an effective platform for delivering an 
accessible walking exercise program (46,47).  A 2012 Pew survey showed that 81% of adult 
Americans use the Internet, with those in the age range of 50 -64 years as equally represented 
online as younger users (48).  Eighteen percent of consumers, aged 65 and older, sought health 
information using the Internet in 2007, compared to 7 percent in 2001 (49).  Previous studies of 
dyspnea self -management sh owed that 34% of persons with COPD (mean age 69 years) used 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /2019

 the Internet for an average of 12 hours a week (50 -52).  Previous work has suggested that 
Internet -mediated, home -based walking programs may be effective at increasing PA (53,54) and 
can be safe f or chronically ill individuals (55,56).   
Use of pedometers may increase walking and improve health outcomes.  In healthy 
subjects, pedometers successfully promote walking for weight loss and blood pressure control 
(57,58).  However, providing a pedometer without structure for feedback and goal setting is 
unlikely to achieve and sustain maximal benefits.   Knowing how many steps one is taking each 
day is not motivating unless one also knows how much walking one should be doing.  Step -count 
logging and goal setting are critical components of effective pedometer -based walking programs, 
but these tasks can be difficult.  A walking program that combines a pedometer with an Internet -
based program could increase the intensity and accuracy of self -monitori ng, be readily accessible, 
reduce participant burden, and facilitate the calculation of individualized step -count goals.  These 
features are particularly important in the Veterans Health Administration ( VHA) with 
geographically dispersed healthcare systems  and patients with complex medical problems.  
Steppi[INVESTIGATOR_700469] (SUH) is a Web -based walking program that interfaces with the 
Omron HJ -720ITC (Omron) pedometer.  [CONTACT_700569] originally developed the 
exercise intervention to promote walking in sedentary persons with cardiovascular disease risk 
factors (59,60).  The SUH intervention is based primarily on Self -Regulation Theory which 
emphasizes an iterati ve, rational process of behavior change (61,62).  An individual working 
towards a behavioral goal learns from successes and failures, and uses this knowledge to develop 
effective behavioral strategies to achieve his or her goal (61) (Figure 1).
 
Accurate s elf-monitoring, feedback, goal setting, and social support are critical 
components of the cycle of self -regulation (62).  SUH supports the cycle of self -regulation with 
four unique components to promote walking:  1) objective walking assessment and feedbac k, 2) 
Figure 1.  Conceptual Model:  Self -Regulation in the Steppi[INVESTIGATOR_700470] 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /2019  
5 
 individualized step -count goals, 3) motivational messages and educational content, and 4) online 
community (Figure 1).  
 
1) Objective Walking Assessment and Feedback :  The Fitbit Zip  pedometer used in our research 
program was selected because it accurately measures step counts in the majority of persons with 
COPD , is easy to use,  and interfaces with the Internet.  By [CONTACT_700522] a 
computer with a USB device called a don gle, participants can upload step -count data to the 
website and view their progress using a variety of detailed graphs.  
 
2)  Individualized Step -Count Goals :  Specific step -count goals are more effective than setting 
goals based on total distance or durati on walked (62).  High target goals improve performance as 
long as the goals are not so high that the participant believes they are impossible to achieve (63).  
Sudden and dramatic increases in PA may also increase the risk of injury and adverse cardiac 
events.  WEB  uses an automated algorithm to compute gradually incrementing, individualized 
step-count goals.  Goals are based on step -count data uploaded by [CONTACT_2299], accurately 
reflecting the participant’s current level of walking.  Goals are not necessarily in creasing over 
time.  For example, if a participant is sick, and thus records low step counts for one week, the 
subsequent week’s goal will be lower than the goal for the week the participant was sick.   
 
3) Motivational Messages and Educational Tips :  Pers ons who are sedentary or who have chronic 
disease face general and disease -specific barriers to starting and maintaining a walking program.  
Specific strategies and behavioral techniques for overcoming these barriers are addressed as 
part of the motivation al messaging component of WEB .  Education about disease management, 
the benefits of PA, and behavior change is also provided online , and some messages are tailored 
to smokers or oxygen users  for more targeted and relevant information .  These features promo te 
exercise self -efficacy and confidence, and encourage compliance.  Users view these materials 
on their website study page.  
 
4) Online Community :  An online community within the WEB  website maintains social support by 
[CONTACT_700523].  Richardson et al. demonstrated that 
subjects with access to an online community remained engaged in the intervention for a longer 
time and were less likely to drop out than those without access to an online community (64).  
Participant s who posted more frequently on the online community increased their step counts 
more that those who posted less frequently (64).   
In a previous study, the u se of SUH for 4 months resulted in an average increase in 
walking of approximately 2,000 steps per  day (1.6 km) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
coronary artery disease, or obesity (64).  In that study, a subset of persons with self -reported 
COPD (n=24) demonstrated an average increase of approximately 1,000 steps per day after use 
of SUH for 4 months (65).  Another study has used the core features of SUH to promote PA in 
women with gestational diabetes (66), while another study is assessing the efficacy of SUH to 
reduce back pain in Veterans (67).  Although it is well known that greater PA  and exercise are 
beneficial, it is unclear how to increase PA in persons with chronic disease such as COPD who 
already experience significant functional impairment from their disease.  As part of her CDA -2, 
[CONTACT_452523] has modified SUH to include website cont ent specific for persons with COPD.  This 
adapted walking program is called Every Step Counts (ESC) for Lung Health.  In a non -
randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we have demonstrated its safety, feasibility, and ability to increase daily 
step counts over 3 m onths in persons with COPD (68) . 
 
 (b)  Significance.    
 Our proposal addresses the exciting and important next steps of developi[INVESTIGATOR_700471].  WEB  is unique because of its 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950891] risk of COPD -related morbidity.  
  
 (c)  Relevance to Veterans Health.   
 The VHA has a strong commitment to providing care to p ersons with COPD and supporting 
research directed at COPD -related disability.  The 2012 -2016 Strategic Plan of the VHA Office of 
Research and Development identifies chronic disease as a strategic objective area of focus and 
specifically includes research i n COPD rehabilitation (Strategic Objective 2.11).  The proposed 
research addresses Rehabilitation R&D Service's current priority area of improving disabled 
Veterans' health -related quality of life by [CONTACT_700524]. The results of this study have strong implications for translation into clinical practice, 
providing an accessible exercise intervention to Veterans with COPD living with significant 
disability.  Based on estimates that [ADDRESS_950892]  COPD (69) and our 
preliminary data that 33 to 64% of COPD patients are Internet users, our proposed intervention 
could help over 8 million persons.   
 A walking program that combines a pedometer with an Internet -based program could increase 
the intensity and accuracy of self -monitoring, be readily accessible, reduce participant burden, 
and facilitate the calculation of individualized step -count goals  are particularly important in the 
Veterans Health Administration ( VHA) with geographically dispersed health care systems and 
patients with complex medical problems.

 in the study for a total of up to 13  months , depending on the timing of the C1 2 in-clinic study visit .  
The intensive interventional phase will be  6 months followed by a maintenance intervention  phase 
of 6 months  and a subsequent 14 -day step count collection using a pedometer at 12 -months  (up 
to 13  months) .  Six -minute walk test dis tance at 6 months will be the primary outcome to assess 
the efficacy of the Internet -mediated, pedometer -based walking program.  Since we are studying 
the efficacy of a walking intervention, the 6MWT distance is the primary outcome of choice.  
Secondary ou tcomes include HRQL, dyspnea, CRP and IL -6 levels, risk of AEs and COPD -
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], engagement in PA assessed by [CONTACT_700518] . Additional secondary 
outcomes include body composition (adiposity) and bone mineral density at baseline and 12

b) Inability to ambulate with or without assistance  
c) Clinical signs of unstable cardiovascular disease or congestive heart failure  
d) Hypoxemia during 6MWT, i.e. oxygen saturation <85% using supplemental oxygen  
e) Inability  to complete questionnaires  
f) Inability to collect at least 5 of 10 days of baseline step counts  
g) Participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program at time of screening or within the 
previous 3 months  
h) Participation in another exercise -related research stud y at time of screening  
i) Plans to participate in an exercise -related research study in the next 12 months  
j) Plans to enroll in a supervised exercise program, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, in the 
next 6 months  
k) Average b aseline step counts of greater than or equal to 10,[ADDRESS_950901] quarter of study year  
(D.13 Gantt Chart).  At VA [LOCATION_011], we will recruit from a clinical list of over 5,[ADDRESS_950902] been seen in the Pulmonary Function Laboratory, the Women’s 
Health Clinic, and the Primary Care Clinics.  We will confirm  the diagnosis of COPD by 
[CONTACT_700528] .  As of May, 2013, s eventy eight percent or 48,425 Veterans 
at VA [LOCATION_011] and 61% or 35,[ADDRESS_950903] Internet access or who do not use Windows 
or Mac operating system at home, but are willing to come to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700474].  We anticipate easily meeting the recruitment goal of 185 subjects.   
To inc rease the diversity of our population, we will over recruit African -American Veterans 
and female Ve terans.  Twenty one percent of V eterans in Alabama are African American, and 10 -
15% of subjects enrolled in COPD trials at VA Birmingham are African American .  The large male 
predominance in the armed services results in the fact that enrollment in any VA -based study will 
be disproportionately male.  Only 11 % of all VA users are women.  Additionally, female Veterans 
tend to be younger than male Veterans, whil e COPD prevalence increases with age, so the 
prevalence of women with COPD in VA is expected to be lower than the prevalence for men.  
Accordingly, we will over -recruit from the VA [LOCATION_011] Women’s Health Clinic which provided care 
to 3,[ADDRESS_950904] , and posting flyers and leav ing brochures  at the VA and 
also in public space s, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and clinics with permission from individual sites  (e.g. local YMCA, 
Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_011] Medical 
Center, etc. ).  Subjects who do not respond to the mailing will receive a telephone call from study 
staff.  This recruitment method has been successful for our previous COPD studies.  Drs. Moy 
and Cooper have an existing relationship working on multi -site COPD clinical  trials.  Our teams 
have extensive experience and success recruiting and retaining subjects with COPD for clinical 
trials and research studies.  Both VA [LOCATION_011] and VA Birmingham are part of the NHLBI COPD 
Clinical Research Network and have successfully rec ruited for the studies, “The Effect of Chronic 
Macrolide Administration on the Frequency and Severity of COPD Exacerbations” and “The Effect 
of Simvastatin Administration on the Frequency and Severity of COPD Exacerbations.”  Both sites 
also recruit and re tain participants for the NHLBI funded “Long Term Oxygen Treatment Trial 
(LOTT).”

Baseline Visit  
 
D.3.  Baseline Visit  
 When interested subjects are scheduled for the baseline clinic visit, they will be mailed a 
medical clearance form which will have been signed by [CONTACT_263235].  The signed 
clearance form must be faxed or submitt ed to study staff prior to randomization and assignment 
to a study arm .  At the baseline study visit, we will review the participant’s medical history and 
obtain information about demo graphics, cigarette use, and prior participation in pulmonary 
rehabilitation.  Comorbidities of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and 
other diagnoses that affect the lower limbs (osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease, hip or 
knee replacements, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic low back pain, lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_121669], peripheral 
vascular disease, or peripheral neuropathy) will be noted.  We will record medication use and 
current use of supplemental oxygen.  We will also assess histo ry of AEs and related medication 
use in the previous 12 months since prior AE strongly predicts future AEs (83).  Weight and height 
will be measured for the calculation of body mass index (BMI).  Baseline data will characterize 
the cohort and allow analysi s of potential confounders.   
We will verify the accuracy of the pedometer in each subject by [CONTACT_700529] a standardized in -clinic walk of 244 meters.  Subjects can use 
assistive devices such as a cane if they typi[INVESTIGATOR_700475].  Only persons in whom the 
pedometer has >90% accuracy in capturing step counts will be eligible.  Eligible subjects will 
perform 6MWT, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], HRQL assessment with the SGRQ and Veterans SF -36, and dyspnea 
assessment with the UC SD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire and MMRC Dyspnea Scale 
(Assessments described in D.6).  Subjects will also complete the Barriers to Exercise 
Questionnaire, Physical Recall Activity Questionnaire, Bristol’s COPD Knowledge Questionnaire, 
Exercise Self -Regulatory Self -Efficacy Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110], CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire, MOS Social Support Survey , Dietary 
Questionnaire , and the Brief Pain Inventory  (short form) .  If a subject do es not have time during 
the study visit to complete the study -related questionnaires, we will contact [CONTACT_700530] a time after the visit or send the questionnaires home with 
the subject to be completed and sent back in a pre -paid mailer. Three tubes of blood (2 
tablespoons) will be drawn by [CONTACT_48571], overnight shipped to [LOCATION_005] Veterans 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_700476] (MAVERIC) at VA [LOCATION_011], and  processed and 
stored for biomarker anal yses.  Subjects recruited at VA [LOCATION_011] will be asked to complete a DXA 
scan to measure  body composition  and bone mineral density at the baseline screening visit. 
Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete a body composition reading using the Omron Fa t 
Loss Monitor (model HBF -306CN) for comparison of body fat measurements between 
measurement methods. The Omron Fat Loss Monitor is a  portable handheld device that the

fashion and will be completed in <[ADDRESS_950906] does not need to complete a scan 
specifically for the  research study . If the DXA scan is not completed, then the body composition 
reading using the Omron Fat Loss Monitor (model HBF -306CN) will not be completed.  
It is expected that some subjects may be unable to complete all the proposed 
assessments during the study visits. Furthermore, subjects may refuse to complete any portion 
of the study assessments.  
Research staff will set up Fitbit Zip pedometers for all subjects who are eligible and require 
a 10-day baseline collection. All subject s will be sent home to  wear the pedometer for [ADDRESS_950907] Software by [CONTACT_700531], or through Bluetooth (whichever works for their computer system) .  Study staff 
will be available to assist subjects navigate any issues with uploading .  In addition to obtaining 
representative baseline step -count data, this run -in period will allow us to gauge subject 
compliance with wearing the pedometer if assigned the in tervention, potentially reducing the 
number of drop -outs.  Participants must have < 3 no-wear days (<200 steps per day) to be eligible 
to be randomized.  Medical clearance will have been obtained from a healthcare provider.  Eligible 
subjects will be rando mized to 1) written instructions  and education  to exercise (usual care) or 2) 
pedometer and Internet -mediated walking program.  Since the sample size is relatively small, we 
will use blocked randomization , and a computer -generated sequence of random number s, with 
the allocation scheme concealed and unpredictable.  Study staff will call the participant to inform 
him/her of the assignment.  Subjects who are randomized to intervention will choose a username 
[CONTACT_700565] w ebsite to upload their step counts.  Study 
staff will help participants choose strong username [CONTACT_700566]. Subjects who are randomized to the control arm will be asked to return the pedometer 
in the prepaid mailer provided and will be informed of the pedometer wear schedule and reminded 
that they will receive the pedometer to keep at the conclusion of study par ticipation. To ensure 
blinding , study staff communicating randomization assignments to subjects will be different from 
study staff conducting follow -up assessments.   
 
Written instructions  and education  to exercise (Usual care, Appendix 1) 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950908] ized script at the randomization phone call , study staff will deliver verbal 
instructions to all subjects to encourage participants to increase one’s walking slowly and steadily, 
and to increase the amount of exercise each week.  Exercise is defined as planned  PA in addition 
to activities performed as part of one’s daily routine.  Daily PA is all PA performed, including 
exercise.  Increasing daily PA and exercise are goals of the program.  Exercise can be mainly 
walking in the community or using exercise eq uipment at a local gym.  We intentionally do not 
specify duration or intensity of exercise both to mirror usual care and to avoid any confusion with 
walking goals instructed by [CONTACT_700532].  Adapted written materials from [CONTACT_576645] (on 
our DSMB), which are currently used at the University of Washington and VA [LOCATION_011], reinforce 
the verbal instructions.  All subjects will receive this 42 -page booklet (Appendix 1) with information  
about cardiovascular endurance and strengthening exercises, an action plan for identifying 
symptoms of a COPD AE, and how to resume exercise after a COPD AE.  The written booklet 
also contains information about oxygen use during exercise and available res ources for smoking 
cessation.  To enhance treatment fidelity (see D.8) and to measure compliance with the study, 
subjects will receive exercise logs in which they will track whether they exercised each day 
(Appendix 2).  The next instance that participant will have contact [CONTACT_700533] a clinic 
visit 3 months following the baseline visit.  
 
Pedometer and Internet -mediated walking program  
Participants randomized to the pedometer and internet -mediated walking program will 
continue to wear  a pedometer  with a holder  and a security strap , and use  a dongle  (or Bluetooth) , 
and will be mailed  a battery tool for the pedometer , and detailed instructions about the study 
website (Appendix 3).  These instructions have been written based on feedback from participants 
in a similar  study to ensure understanding of website features and to maximize their use.  
Additionally, subjects will receive identical written instructions  that the control grou p received 
encouraging subjects to increase their walking . Subjects  who have been randomized to 
intervention  will be contact[CONTACT_700534].  
Subjects will provide the telephone number which they will u se to receive the weekly step -count 
goals.  Subjects will choose a username [CONTACT_700567].  Subjects will  have access to a personalized W eb page where they can view graphical 
displays of step counts and walking progress, motivat ional and educational messages , and the 
online community .  Subjects will be asked to wear the lightweight, unobtrusive pedometer every 
day, except while awake or showering/bathing, during the 12-month intervention period.  Subjects  
will be instructed to upload their step -count data to the study website as often as they wish, but 
at least weekly.  The first goal will be calculated from the baseline step counts.  Each Sunday  
thereafter, the study computer will run the goal calculation  algorithm and post each participan t’s 
step-count goal on his/her W eb page.  The week’s step -count goal will be prominently displayed 
on each subject’s personal study Web page in the text and the graphs  (Figure 4 ).  In addition, 
study staff will call parti cipants each Monday to inform them of their weekly step -count goals.  I n 
order to keep goals up -to-date, study staff will call participants to remind them  to upload if they 
have not upl oaded step counts in > 7 days.

The specific items involved with developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], testing, and maintaining the website include:  
 
a) Procuring, managing and securing database and Web servers, system -level software and 
site/user licensing required to run the system.  
b) Ongoing management and maintenance of the system and syst em security throughout the

treatment of a COPD exacerbation.  Participants in both arms will be  seen in our research clinics 
at months 3, 6, and 12 (Table 5).  At each follow -up visit, study staff will remind participants not 
to disclose treatment arm.  Subjects will be reminded that they should be working to slowly and 
steadily increase their walki ng and exercise.  Subjects will perform 6MWT, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], and HRQL 
assessments.  All changes in medication or clinical status will be noted, any potential adverse 
events recorded, and a history of any COPD exacerbations or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479952] 3 
months ascertained.  We will also assess dyspnea (UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire 
and MMRC Scale), physical activity (CHAMPS and Moy), and depression (Beck Depression 
Inventory).  Subjects w ill also complete the following questionnaires: the Barri ers to Exercise, 
Physical Activity Recall, VR -36, MOS Social Support, Bristol’s COPD Knowledge, Exercise Self -
Efficacy, Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110], the Brief Pain Inventory  (short form , administered at C03, 
C06 and C12 ), and the Dietary Questionnaire  (only a dministered at C00 and C12) . The 
intervention subjects will also complete the Intervention Feedback Questionnaire  that asks about 
the subject’s experience with the study website and pedometer  at the [ADDRESS_950911] to be completed 
and returned  in a pre -paid mailer . 
To objectively measure engagement in PA, the pedometer will directly measure 14 days 
of walking of subjects in both arms.  To assess treatment fideli ty, exercise logs will be collected 
from subjects each month.  Participants will be contact[CONTACT_700536] 9.  They will 
provide an interim history of home exercise and answer questions about symptoms, medications, 
AEs, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46993] o ccurred during the prior 3 months.  Subjects will also receive a 
mailing with questionnaires ( Barriers to Exercise, Physical Activity Recall, SGRQ, VR -36, UCSD 
SOB, Bristol’s COPD Knowledge, Exercise Self -Efficacy, CHAMPS Physical Activity, Beck 
Depression  Inventory, and Exercise Logs) to complete at home.  At any time, if a subject 
experiences a medical problem that prevents walking and exercise, s/he will be suspended from 
the study.  S/he will resume the study when s/he has returned to baseline clinical status.   
It is expected that some subjects may be unable to complete all the proposed 
assessments during the study visits. Furthermore, subjects may refuse to complete any portion 
of the study assessments.

D.6. Short - and Long -Term Outcome Assessments:  All tests will be conducted by [CONTACT_464], 
technicians, or physicians who are blinded to treatment assignment.  
 
Primary Outcome:  Exercise capacity:   Exercise capacity will be assessed with maximal 
distance walked on the 6MWT, performed according to ATS guidelines (80).  Both sites currently 
have a designated course in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700477] 6MW T 
as part of the NHLBI LOTT protocol.  In general, persons will be asked to cover as much distance 
as possible in 6 minutes, and the distance walked will be recorded .  Subjects can use assistive 
devices, such as a cane, if they typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] (more than half th e time) use one for walking.  Subjects 
will use supplemental oxygen if already prescribed oxygen for use during physical activity.  If 
hypoxemia, oxygen saturation <85%, is observed at the end of the 6MWT, subjects will be 
temporarily excluded from further  study participation and their primary provider contact[CONTACT_700537].  These subjects can be reassessed for eligibility at a later date.  Hypoxemia and 
dyspnea predict balance impairment and falls in COPD (89); both will be assessed by [CONTACT_700538] 6MWT. Also, the 6MWT will not be performed if the subject is unsteady 
on his feet during the initial short walk used to assess pedometer accuracy, and demonstrates a 
high risk of falling. Staff performing the 6MWT will be trained in  Basic Life Support.  Emergency 
treatments, including nebulizer therapy, an automated external defibrillator, and a code cart, will 
be available. We chose 6MWT distance as the measure of exercise capacity as opposed to 
maximum oxygen consumption or workloa d on a CPETT for several reasons.  First, the 6MWT is 
easy to perform and a minimum clinically important change (54 meters) has been established in 
stable COPD (90).  Distance walked on 6MWT is used in the calculation of the BODE (body mass, 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /2019  
17 
 airflow obstru ction, dyspnea, exercise capacity)  index, a marker of COPD severity that predicts 
mortality (91).  In contrast, CPETTs require specialized equipment and the clinical relevance of 
changes in maximal oxygen consumption or workload is unclear.  
 
Secondary Outc omes:   
a. HRQL:  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -specific HRQL will be assessed with the SGRQ (82,92). We will examine 
the composite Total Score as well as the subscales of Activity, Symptoms, and Impact.  Lower 
SGRQ scores indicate better health status.  The SGRQ has been v alidated and used extensively 
in assessments of HRQL in COPD (82,92).  
The Veterans’ SF -36 questionnaire will be used to assess general health status.  
   
b. Dyspnea (Appendix 2):  Dyspnea  will be quantified with the UCSD Shortness of Breath 
Questionnaire (9 3) which has been widely used in COPD research.  The minimal clinically 
important change has been determined to be + 5 units (94).  Dyspnea will also be assessed using 
the MMRC scale (responses [ADDRESS_950914] dyspneic) which is used to calculate  the 
BODE index (81, 91).  
 
c. Markers of Systemic Inflammation: Blood will be collected by [CONTACT_700539] 10 mL 
purple top EDTA tubes.  Samples from both study sites will be shipped to MAVERIC for processing 
and storage.  Samples will be centrifuged and the plasma isolated.  Plasma will be stored in 1 mL 
aliquots and frozen at -80 0C.  For the analysis of CRP and IL -6, aliquots will be sent to the Clinical 
& Epi[INVESTIGATOR_700478], Department of Laboratory Medicine at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700479], a state -of-the-art laboratory that specializes in micro -analysis and is dedicated to 
testing for research studies.  This laboratory has performed our previous CRP and IL -6 analyses, 
and these assays are standardized and highly reproducible.   
 
C-Reactive Protein (CRP):  The concentration of CRP will be determined us ing an 
immunoturbidimetric assay on the Hitachi 917 analyzer ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), 
using reagents and calibrators from Denka Seiken (Niigata, Japan).  In this high sensitivity assay, 
an antigen -antibody reaction occurs between CRP in the s ample and an anti -CRP antibody that 
has been sensitized to latex particles, and agglutination results. This antigen -antibody complex 
causes an increase in light scattering, which is detected spectrophotometrically, with the 
magnitude of the change being pr oportional to the concentration of CRP in the sample. This assay 
has a sensitivity of 0.03 mg/L. The day -to-day variability of the assay at concentrations of 0.91, 
3.07 and 13.38 mg/L are 2.8, 1.6 and 1.1%, respectively.   
 
Interleukin -6 (IL -6): IL-6 is measured by [CONTACT_377483] -sensitive ELISA assay from R & D Systems 
(Minneapolis, MN).  The assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immune assay 
technique.  A monoclonal antibody specific for IL -6 has been pre -coated onto a microtitre plate.  
After the samples, standards, controls and conjugates are added to the wells, IL -6 is sandwiched 
between the immobilized antibody and the enzyme -linked antibody specific to IL -6.  Upon the 
addition of substrate, a color is generated that is proportional to th e amount of IL -6 present in the 
sample.  The minimum required volume for this assay is 200 µL. The assay has a sensitivity of 
0.094 pg/mL, and the day -to-day variabilities of the assay at concentrations of 0.66, 1.97 and 8.16 
pg/mL are 12.2%, 7.6%, and 9.9 %, respectively.  
 
d. Acute Exacerbation and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452485]:   Assessment of AEs and COPD -related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452486] -report and medical chart review.  During the study, all 
subjects will be instructed to call study staff with any  changes in clinical status or medications.  
Most patients remember the occurrence of AEs because they are well -defined periods of 
worsening symptoms that require treatment with an antibiotic and/or prednisone (83).  At clinic 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950915]. Garshick’s major role on the 
project is to adjudicate the clinical events during the study.  He will have no involvement in the 
day-to-day conduct of the study and will be blinded to subjects’ treatment assignment and 
baseline test results.  He will review subject responses and all medical records to determine if an 
AE or COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700480].  An AE will be clearly defined as “a complex of 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_1856] (increased or new onset) of more than one of the following: cough, sputum, 
wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with a duration of at least 3 days, requiring treatment with 
antibiotics or systemic steroids” (84).  Occurrence of AEs within 14 days of each other will be 
considered a single AE (85,86).  This definition will also be used at the baseline visit for 
assessment of occurrence of AEs in the year prior to study entry.  
 
e. Daily Step Count:  A secondary outcome, daily step count will b e used to directly measure 
engagement in PA in both arms.  To measure baseline step count, subjects will be instructed to 
wear the pedometer attached to a belt or garment waistband during all waking hours except when 
showering/bathing for [ADDRESS_950916] a sticker covering the digital 
display to prevent feedback.  After randomization, the pedometer is part of the WEB  intervention.  
In addition, the pedometer will be used to directly measure PA as a secondary outcome in  both 
arms in the following ways: In those randomized to the intervention arm and already using the 
pedometer, we will average daily step count over the [ADDRESS_950917] practices for reporting PA data, we a priori  define a no -wear 
day as one with < 200 steps, and nonadherence with step -count monitoring as having 8 or more 
(of 14) no -wear days (45,78).  These defini tions will be applied identically to both  arms.  These 
restrictions will ensure that the average step counts used in the analyses represent typi[INVESTIGATOR_700481] [ADDRESS_950918] the primary aim of the 
study to examine the effi cacy of WEB  to increase exercise capacity, as indicated by 6MWT 
distance.   
 
f. Assessment of Body Composition and Bone Mineral Density  (VA[LOCATION_011] site only) : We 
will use a 5th generation GE Healthcare iDXA  dual x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner with 
enCore configuration version 12.3 to determine BMD, to assess total body composition, and 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950919] DXA 
scans performed at baseli ne and approximately  12 months from baseline .  For BMD assessment, 
scanning will be performed at the hip, the distal radius, and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  Regions with evidence of 
heterotopic ossification will be excluded from analyses since this will interfere with the  accurate 
determination of BMD.  Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete a body fat reading using 
the Omron Fat Loss Monitor (model HBF -306CN) for comparison of body fat measurement with 
the DXA scan, at baseline and approximately [ADDRESS_950920] who is pregnant or who has a pacemaker or defibrillator to minimize any 
potential risks.  
 
Other Clinical Assessments  
a. Pulmonary Function:   Pulmonary function testing will determine the FEV 1, with testing 
performed according to ATS guidelines (79).  We anticipate no meaningful change in FEV 1 during 
the course of the study, but we will confirm this by [CONTACT_700540][INVESTIGATOR_700482].   Both 
sites will use a portable spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (nSpi[INVESTIGATOR_700483], Inc.).  Data will be presented in absolute 
numbers and as percent of reference predicted values, using prediction equations from 
Hankinson (95).   
 
Contraindications for PFT:  
Pulmonary function te sting will not be performed in subjects within 3 months following a 
myocardial infarction, diagnosis of an abnormal heart rhythm, abdominal or thoracic surgery, 
brain, ear, eye or ENT surgery, unstable angina, or oral or facial pain that could be exacerbat ed 
by a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. PFT will not be performed if heart rate is < 40 or > 120.  These conditions will 
be assessed with a screening questionnaire  and measurement of heart rate .   
 
Withholding of Usual Bronchodilator Therapy:  
For this study, subjects are not asked to withhold their bronchodilators.

 b. Depression:  Depression will be assessed with the 24 -item Beck Depression Inventory (96).  
Patients with a Beck total score > 14 will, with the patient’s permission, have their primary 
healthcare providers informed of the results, with the suggestion that they might consider referral 
for evaluation and/or treatment o f depression. Additionally, t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_700484] 9 of the Beck’s, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_700485].   
 
c. Physical Activity Questionnaires (Appendix 2):  We will use the community healthy activities 
model program for seniors (CHAMPS) Physical Activity Questionnaire (97).  The CHAMPS is a 
41-item instrument validated in the elderly, which assesses PA information from several domains 
including leisure, househol d, and occupational.  Frequency and total time spent per week allows 
estimation of caloric expenditure.  In addition, we will use a Physical Activity Recall  checklist 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Moy to measure free -living PA specifically in patients with COPD (20).  A higher 
number of daily activities performed is associated with better indices of COPD status, including 
higher FEV 1 and lower BODE index (20).  
 
d. COPD Knowledge : The Bristol Knowledge Questionnaire will be used to test what patients 
learn and und erstand about COPD.  The 65 items require 10 -20 minutes to complete and cover 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_700486], exacerbations, smoking, vaccination, and medication use.  It has 
demonstrated internal consistency, validity and reliability.  
 
e. Exercise Self Efficacy : The belief in one’s ability to self -regulate and exercise regularly when 
faced with challenges is a key variable that influences exercise adherence.  The Exercise Self -
Regulatory Efficacy Scale (Ex -SRES) for persons with COPD will be used to measure exerc ise 
self-regulation.  The Ex -SRES incorporates items from Resnick’s self -efficacy scale for older 
adults and McCauley’s self -efficacy questionnaire for sedentary adults.  The 16 -item 
questionnaire has been shown to be reliable and valid in COPD.

Monitoring for Adverse Events (AdEs)  
We have convened an independent, external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
to review recruitment, follow -up rates, protocol adherence, and safety results.  The DSMB is 
composed of Elizabeth Klings , MD, an expert in pulmonary rehabilitation and COPD clinical trials 
and pulmonologist at [LOCATION_011] Medical Center , Huong Nguyen, Ph.D. an expert in telemedicine 
methods in COPD at Southern [LOCATION_004] Kaiser Permanente, and DorAnn e Donesky , RN, PhD, 
NP an expert in patient -centered coaching and behavioral change methodologies and 
interventions  in persons with COPD at Touro University of [LOCATION_004] .  They will meet every 6 
months, and as needed, by [CONTACT_580109].  They will monitor the number of adverse 
events ( AdEs) and serious adverse eve nts (SAEs) and unanticipated problems between the [ADDRESS_950922] common SAE

addition, subjects will be screened for clinically active cardiovascular disease (such as angina or 
decompensated congestive heart failure) and exercise -induced hypoxemia as part of baseline 
testing.  Subjects in bot h arms will be instructed to notify their healthcare provider if they 
experience any change in their clinical condition, and to notify study staff of any change in 
medications, urgent care visits, emergency room visits, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  During the stu dy, 
subjects will be regularly monitored for adverse effects of exercise during clinic visits and 
telephone contacts.  In addition, participants can report adverse events (AdEs) by [CONTACT_700541].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_700487] y reported AdE suggests clinical 
deterioration warranting immediate medical attention.  All SAEs and unanticipated problems will 
be reported to the respective IRBs at the time of continuing review, but would be reported to  the 
study DSMB immediately.  If a n event is possibly, probably or definitely related to the intervention, 
it will be classified as intervention -related.   
 
 
Assessment of Treatment Fidelity  
To promote treatment fidelity in both groups, study staff will review instructions to slowly 
and steadily increase walking and exercise with participants every 3 months (98).  To measure 
treatment fidelity in both groups, subjects will complete daily exerc ise logs (98).  The exercise log 
is intentionally simple to minimize its potential influence to be part of the intervention (Appendix 
2).  Subjects circle a yes/no response to three  questions about whether exercise was performed 
that day.  Subjects will re turn the logs by [CONTACT_700542], and review them in 
person every 3 months.  Compliance with treatment in both arms will be defined as having >70% 
of days (~5 out of 7 days/week) with exercise.  We propose an intention -to-treat analysis sin ce 
the reasons for noncompliance may be related to COPD severity.  Thus, all subjects will be 
analyzed and not excluded based on compliance.  As a sensitivity analysis, however, we will 
examine 6MWT distance and secondary outcomes on a per -protocol basis, where noncompliant 
subjects ( >30% of days with no exercise performed on logs) from each treatment arm will be 
excluded from the analysis (Table 2).

The most important factor affect ing compliance is the complexity of the intervention.  Our 
experience indicates that the WEB  program and pedometer intervention pose minimal participant 
burden.  The WEB  intervention is designed to foster compliance, using a dynamic website  and 
immediate f eedback.   Subjects upload step counts and visit the website at their convenience.  
ESC, a similar study,  has shown persistent engagement by [CONTACT_700543] 3,  and similar 
retention and engagement has been shown at month 12 in a separate study.  Our p reliminary 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950925] of 
access to the website to obtain new step count goal, as well as to upload pedometer data but no 
new educational content posted about a walking program. During the maintenance interven tion 
phase  (months 7 -12), subjects will be able to access content posted previously about the walking 
program . We believe that maintaining a dynamic website with relevant and changing content will 
keep participants engaged in the intervention.  Feedback fr om the graphs is most commonly used 
by [CONTACT_700544].  We will provide a user -friendly written guide to 
all the features of the website .  We will measure treatment fidelity specific to the intervention group 
by [CONTACT_700545] (1) no -wear days of the pedometer, (2) subjects who require telephone 
call reminders to upload, and (3) logins to the website.  
 
Minimizing Attrition and Handling Missing Data  
We will do everything we can to minimize attrition and missing data.  Our run -in period 
prior to randomization (when at least 10 days of baseline step counts are required to be collected 
from an eligible participant) will screen out those who may be potential drop -outs.  Time spent 
with the healthcare provider, the continuity of care, and the communication style of providers may 
improve retention.  We will structure the clinic visits and follow -up telephone contacts such that 
each participant interacts with the same research assistant on each occasion.  Monetary 
compensation has been shown to be the best strategy to achieve protocol  adherence and 
minimize missing outcomes data (78).  We will disperse  $50 in payment to subjects at the baseline 
in-clinic study visit and a $25 payment at each of the following in -clinic study visits (3 -month, 6 -
month and 12 -month) for their travel -relate d costs, time and effort.  Additionally, subjects will be 
given the Fitbit Zip  which was used during their participation  at the end of the research study ( up 
to 13  months).   For both arms, the face -to-face clinic visits, the regularly scheduled telephone 
contacts between study staff and subjects, and the subject remuneration will aid in achieving our 
anticipated retention rate of at least 60% at 6 months .  In our other COPD studies, our loss to 
follow -up is low, ranging from 0% to 4%, at [ADDRESS_950926] designed the testing windows to minimize missing data.  At months 3 and 6, testing will  be 
allowed within a window of + 2 weeks.  At months 9 and 12, testing will be allowed within a window 
of + 1 month , making the total participation time up to 13 months from the baseline in -clinic study 
visit (C00) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_52506] -up, some m issing data are expected with multiple testing 
visits.  We will collect the reasons for missing data such as death, COPD exacerbation, medical 
reasons, or non -medical reasons.  We will compare the rate of losses to follow -up at 3, 6, 9, and 
[ADDRESS_950927] of association.  We will assess whether 
any baseline characteristics such as age, FEV 1 % predicted, or 6MWT distance, are associated 
with losses to follow -up using chi -square tests for categorical baseline data and a nalysis of 
variance for continuous baseline data.  If baseline variables and treatment group are found to be 
associated with loss to follow -up, then the analysis models will be modified to include the differing 
baseline variables as covariates to provide u nbiased estimates of intervention effects.  For 
subjects who discontinue the study early due to worsening of COPD or due to death, missing 
outcome data will be imputed using the least favorable data observed prior to discontinuation.  
Missing data for subj ects who miss a visit not related to worsening of COPD will be imputed using 
last observed data.  We will also perform sensitivity analyses using the complete case method, 
excluding those with no observed outcome at 6 months.

Statistics (power analysis)  
Prior to analyzing the outcomes, we will summarize and compare baseline demographic 
and clinical variables by [CONTACT_1570]. Any unbalanced characteristics occurring despi[INVESTIGATOR_700488].  Analyses will 
be performed with the SAS statistical software package (9.3, SAS Institute; Cary , NC).   
 
Primary Aim :  To determine the efficacy of the WEB  intervention to increase 6MWT distance.  
We focus on 6MWT distance at [ADDRESS_950930] factor analysis or analysis of variance 
(ANOVA).  This approach will assess the effect of intervention versus control on 6MWT distance, 
using absolute measures of 6MWT distance at baseline and [ADDRESS_950931] of treatment (intervention versus control), and additionally allow us 
to assess the interaction between treatment and time (treatment *time) on 6MWT distance.  We 
will use a mixed model (PROC MIXED in SAS) to perform the [ADDRESS_950932] ANOVA given its flexibility 
of modeling the variances and covariances, its robustness in accounting for correlated data 
(repeated measures data), and its flexibility in handling missing data.  Mod els will have 6MWT 
distance as the dependent variable, and treatment, time, and treatment *time as independent 
variables.  In this approach, models will also include study site and any unbalanced baseline 
characteristics as covariates.  Primary analyses to determine the effect of WEB  on 6MWT 
distance will use the intention -to-treat approach to include as many randomized subjects as 
possible in the analyses.  Subjects will be considered to be in his/her randomly assigned arm no 
matter how much he/she particip ated in it.  As a sensitivity analysis, however, we will examine 
6MWT distance on a per -protocol basis, where noncompliant subjects ( >30% of days with no 
exercise performed on logs) in each treatment arm will be excluded from the analysis.  
 
Anticipated Res ults:  We anticipate that subjects in the intervention group will have significantly 
higher 6MWT distance than subjects in the control group at 6 months.   
 
Power Calculation :  This study is powered on our pre -specified primary outcome of 6MWT 
distance.  O ur main comparison is 6MWT distance at [ADDRESS_950933] deviation  for 
6MW T distance of 80 -120 meters (90).  Our data in a similar Veteran population showed a 
standard deviation of [ADDRESS_950934] deviation of 100 meters 
in our power calculation.  Using the sample size formula for the comparison of the means of 2 
independent samples, we calculate that 55 evaluable subjects in each arm at 6 months will allow 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950935] 54 meters between the WEB  and usual care arms with a power 
of 80% and α=0.05.  We anticipate a maximal d rop-out of 40% at [ADDRESS_950936] 111 
evaluable subjects at 6 months, we plan to enroll a total of  185 subjects.   
 
Secondary Aims :  To estimate the effect of the WEB  intervention on (a) HRQL, as measured by 
[CONTACT_6016]. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ), (b) dyspnea, (c) CRP and IL -6, (d) risk of 
AEs and COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], (e) engagement in PA as measured by [CONTACT_700518] , 
(f) body composition  and bone mineral density , and (g) pain.  
Our statistical analysis plan for the secondary outcomes is similar to that for the primary 
outcome.  We will use [ADDRESS_950937] factor analysis or analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the effect 
of intervention versus control on SGRQ -TS, dyspnea score, CRP and IL -6, and daily step count.  
We will analyze absolute values of the secondary outcomes at baseline and [ADDRESS_950938] of our intervention, and additionally allow us to assess 
the interaction between treatment and  time (treatment *time) on the secondary outcomes.  We will 
use a mixed model (PROC MIXED in SAS) to perform the [ADDRESS_950939] 
SGRQ -TS, dyspnea score, CRP and IL -6, or daily step count as the dependent variable, and 
treatment, time, and tre atment *time as independent variables.  Models will also include study site 
and any unbalanced baseline characteristics as covariates.   
Total number of AEs and COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700489] [ADDRESS_950940] 
14 days following the previous AE (86).  Given the count data and expected Poisson distribution 
of number of AEs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], negative binomial regression models (PROC GENMOD) 
will be used to calculate risk ratios for AE and COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (86).  The 
multivariate regression model will include number of AEs (or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) as the dependent variable, treatment group 
as the main predictor, as well as study site, number of AEs (or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) in the year pri or to enrollment, and any 
unbalanced baseline characteristics.  
 
Body Composition by [CONTACT_363319]:   Body composition and 
regional fat analysis will be performed at the baseline study 
visit and the [ADDRESS_950941] cuts that define 
the arms, legs, and trunk (see figure to the left).  These data 
can be also be used to calculate a waist -hip ratio (i.e., ratio of 
central fat to hip fat) in a standardized fashion using the same landmarks as illustrated by [CONTACT_700550] -tissue image.  The DXA software can be used to define standard waist 
and hip regions that will allow comparabi lity of these measurements throughout the study.  The 
lower boundary of the central or waist region, which is also referred to as the android region (A, 
see figure), is the cut through the pelvis at the level of the iliac crests.  The upper boundary of the  
android region extends upwards to 20% of the distance between the  pelvis and the top of the 
shoulders and the lateral boundaries are the arm cuts.  The upper boundary of the gynoid region 
of interest (G, see figure) is the region below the pelvis cut that  extends downward from 1.5 times 
the height of the android region.  Lateral boundaries of the gynoid region are the outer leg cuts.  
G 
A 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950942] to hip fat ratio, or android to gynoid ratio, is the percent fat in the android region divided 
by [CONTACT_700551].  Percent fat mass in each region is reported as the total of 
the percent fat in the right and left sides .  The precision of regional fat measurements is +/ -1%. 
 
Subjects will be asked to complete a body composition measurement using the Omron Fat Loss 
Monitor (model HBF -306CN) in order to compare body fat measurements with the DXA. Since 
DXA is the gold standard, the Omron Fat Loss Monitor is being examined as a cost -effective and 
less invasive alternative method to measure body fat c omposition. The monitor has been 
approved for use in the general population except in individuals who are pregnant or who have 
implanted medical devices such as pacemakers or defibrillators; we will therefore exclude any 
subject who is pregnant or who has a pacemaker or defibrillator to minimize any potential risks.  
 
Anticipated Results:  We anticipate that subjects in the intervention group will have better HRQL, 
less dyspnea, lower CRP and IL -6 levels, higher daily step count, lower adiposity, higher bone  
mineral density and lower risk of AEs and COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700490] 6 months.   
 
Power Calculations:   A sample size of [ADDRESS_950943] size of 0.55 SD units with 80% power and α=0.05. 
Using the SD’s obtained from our cross -sectional observational study, we can detect a change of 
at least 10 units in SGRQ -TS, 1.8  mg/L in CRP level, and 0.59 pg/mL in IL -6 level.   In addition, 
as an estimate for anticipated differences between arms, we examined the mean 6MWT distance, 
SGRQ -TS, CRP, and IL -6 levels in those who walked above and in those who walked below the 
median daily step count in our observational data.   We observed a difference of 1.27 pg/mL in IL -
6 in those who walked above and in those who walked be low the median daily step count, values 
greater than our detectable difference suggesting sufficient power.  We found a difference of 7 
units in SGRQ -TS and 0.96 mg/L in CRP.   While these preliminary observed estimates of 
difference in SGRQ -TS and CRP are slightly smaller than our calculated detectable estimates,  we 
anticipate there will be sufficient power to detect differences in these secondary outcomes when 
the analyzed groups are differentiated by [CONTACT_700532], since our power calculations 
based on groups dichotomized at the median step count are conservative.   In calculating power 
for detecting differences in risk of AEs, we expect to observe 106 AEs in the 111 subjects 
completing a 12 -month follow -up period based on our preliminary data.   Given this rate and using 
the POISS_SS macro of E. Bergstralh (a Poisson power calculator), we will be able to detect a 
rate ratio of at least 1.70 with 80% power and 1.85 with 90% power.   Again, to estimate antic ipated 
observed differences between treatment arms, we examined the number of AEs in those who 
walked above and in those who walked below the median daily step count in our observational 
data.  One hundred thirty -six AEs were observed in those who walked be low the median daily step 
count and [ADDRESS_950944] of 
the interaction between treatment and time (treatment *time), as well as the between -subject group 
treatment effect (intervention versus control)  and the within -subject effect (repeated over time) on 
6MWT distance.  We will use a mixed model (PROC MIXED in SAS) to perform the repeated 
measures ANOVA.  We will examine both compound symmetry and AR(1) correlation structures.  
Models will have 6MWT di stance at each time point as the dependent variable, and treatment, 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /2019  
27 
 time, and treatment *time as independent variables.  Models will also have study site and any 
unbalanced baseline subject characteristics as covariates.  Similarly, additional analyses will  be 
conducted with repeated measures ANOVA using all time points --baseline, 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_950945] of the interaction between 
treatment and time (treatment *time), as well as the between -subject g roup treatment effect 
(intervention versus control) and the within -subject effect (repeated over time) on SGRQ -TS, 
dyspnea score, CRP and IL -6 levels, and daily step count.  We will use a mixed model (PROC 
MIXED in SAS) to perform the repeated measures ANO VA.  Models will have the secondary 
outcome at each time point as the dependent variable, and treatment, time, and treatment *time 
as independent variables.  Models will also have study site and any unbalanced baseline subject 
characteristics as covariates.    
As outlined in our Conceptual Model, we will also explore whether increases in PA (6MWT 
distance and daily step counts) result in decreases in levels of systemic inflammation and risk of 
AEs, regardless of treatment arm.  Models, adjusting for baseline 6MWT distance or step counts, 
will examine whether increases in PA independently predict decreases in inflammatory 
biomarkers and decreased risk of AEs and COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  We will use linear 
regression models with change in 6MWT distance as  the independent variable, and change in IL -
6 and CRP as dependent variables.  A multivariate regression analysis (PROC GENMOD) will be 
conducted with number of AEs (or COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) as the dependent variable, and 
change in daily step coun t and baseline daily step count as independent variables.  Models will 
account for potential confounders such as study site, season of enrollment, age, gender, comorbid 
medical conditions, FEV 1 % predicted, BMI, and history of prior AEs.  We believe we wil l show 
that increases in 6MWT and daily step count, regardless of treatment arm, independently predict 
decreases in CRP and IL -6, and decreases in the risk of AEs and COPD -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
These exploratory models have the potential to provide si gnificant insight into the mechanisms of 
the beneficial impact of walking and PA on systemic inflammation and COPD -related morbidity.  
The results of these exploratory analyses will provide estimates for sample size calculations for 
future research proposa ls. 
 
 (d)  Discuss potential problems and limitations of the proposed methods and/or procedures 
and possible alternative procedures to achieve the specific aims.   
 
 Like most clinical trials, the study may face recruitment challenges.  We believe that we have 
carefully examined the number of Veterans with COPD and Internet access and we have an 
accurate assessment of the number of potential participants eligible for t he trial.  We acknowledge 
that there is no attention control group.  However, the study is designed to compare the WEB  
intervention to usual care.  Providing attention and social support are critical components of the 
exercise intervention under study so i t would be inappropriate to control for them.  An alternative 
control group could be pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).  However, an equivalence trial comparing 
a program like WEB  to PR is a different question than the one we are proposing which is to study 
the efficacy of WEB .  We believe that PR would have greater positive effects on 6MWT distance 
than WEB .  In fact, participation in a PR program within the previous [ADDRESS_950946] pragmatically 
mirror usual care.   
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950947]-validated portion of PR programs (24,27,42,43).  Furthermore, the pedometer does not 
provide information about the intensity of the walking performed.  However, the literature and our 
preliminary data suggest that all forms of walki ng are beneficial in COPD, whether walking as part 
of functional community mobility or walking as part of sustained cardiovascular exercise.  There 
may also be selection bias of subjects who are less sick and interested in an exercise research 
study.  In s um, the proposed study has the potential to transform current clinical management of 
COPD and advance our understanding of how to promote PA in persons with COPD.   
 
 (e)  If humans or animals are to be studied, power analysis needs to be used to justify t he 
number to be studied.  Justify the species of animal to be used.  If cell lines or tissue specimens 
are used, discuss the source of the material.  
 
Please also see Power Calculations  above.  If the participant provides consent, at each of the 
four in-person study visit s, we will take three tubes of blood (approximately 2 tablespoons) by 
[CONTACT_700552]. B lood sample s will be used to examine 
the occurrence of various blood protein markers (i.e. biochemicals t hat indicate inflammation or 
other related changes) that may influence overall health.  Blood samples will be processed and 
stored at VA [LOCATION_011]’s MAVERIC.  Samples will be sent to [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700491] C-reactive protein and Interleuki n-6. To protect confidentiality, blood samples will be stored at 
VA [LOCATION_011] MAVERIC using only a study code with no personal identifiers.

(1)  Risks to Subjects  
 
1.a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics:  
Collaborating Sites: VA Birmingham Medical Center (Birmingham, AL)  
The majority of subjects recruited for the study will be Veterans.  However, we also wish to 
include non -Veterans to increase the gener alizability of our results and to increase our recruitment 
pool.  We anticipate enrolling up to 185 male and female subjects with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD).    
 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Both genders are eligible to participate in this study.  The large male predominance in the 
armed services results in the fact that enrollment in any VA -based study will be disproportionately 
male.  Only 11 % of all VA users are women.  Additionally, femal e Veterans tend to be younger 
than male Veterans; since COPD prevalence increases with age, the prevalence of women with 
COPD in VA is expected to be lower than that for men.  Accordingly, we will over recruit from the 
VA [LOCATION_011] Women’s Health Clinic which  provided care to 3,123 unique females in FY 12, of whom 
140 had the diagnosis of COPD.  All minority subjects eligible for this study will be included.  To 
increase the diversity of our population, we will over recruit African -American Veterans.  VA 
Birmi ngham is an ideal recruitment site as 21% of Veterans in Alabama are African American, 
and 10 -15% of subjects at VA Birmingham enrolled in COPD trials are African American.  
Reflecting the general Veteran population, the anticipated race distribution of al l subjects enrolled 
will be 91% White, 6.5% African American, 1.6% Native American, and 0.9% Asian.  It is anticipated 
that 3% will be of Hispanic ethnicity.

1.b. Sources of Materials :  We expect to enroll up to  240 persons with COPD  and to randomize up 
to 185 eligible participants .  All data will be obtained specifically for research purposes.  No existing 
specimens, records, or data will be used.  Pedometer data, questionnaire data, exercise and 
pulmonary function data, and serum biomarker levels will be collected from human subje cts and 
used for research purposes only.   
 
1.c.  Potential Risks.   Describe the potential risks to subjects (physical, psychological, social, 
legal, or other) and assess their likelihood and seriousness to the subjects. Differentiate the 
therapeutic risk from research risk.   
 
Therapeutic risk  is the risk or potential risks associated with an intervention that is required for 
medical care, but  occurs as part of the research.  An example is an endoscopy that was 
required for medical follow -up of a specific illness.   
 
This study has n o therapeutic risks.  
 
Research risk  is associated with an intervention that is done only for research purposes 
regardless if it is an experimental intervention or a commonly used intervention, for example, an 
extra endoscopy.  Where appropriate, describe alternative treatments and procedures, including 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /2019  
30 
 the risks and benefits of the alternative treatments and procedur es to participants in the 
proposed research.  
 
Potential Risks:   
1.c.i. Pedometer:   There is no risk to wearing the pedometer, which is commercially available.  The 
walk performed by [CONTACT_700554].  Subjects will be allowed to rest and will be allowed to use supplemental oxygen 
if usually prescribed.   
 
1.c.ii. Questionnaires:   The only possible risk of questionnaire administration involves the social and 
psychological risk resulting from inadvertent disclosur e of medical history information.  All 
questionnaire responses collected by [CONTACT_700555], and 
identified by [CONTACT_700556].  
 
1.c.iii.  Physiological assessments :  The pulmonary function test and  6MWT may leave a subject 
temporarily more short of breath.  Subjects will be allowed to rest and will be allowed to use 
supplemental oxygen if usually prescribed.  Subjects might feel lightheaded while breathing out 
forcefully to perform the pulmonary fun ction test.  Rarely a person might briefly pass out during 
the forced exhalation.  Although it is unusual to have any discomfort, in those who have existing 
back pain, a forced exhalation may re sult in additional discomfort. The 6MWT may cause low 
oxygen l evels in the blood or an irregular heart rhythm.  There is a potential risk of falls during the 
6MWT.  
 
The breathing test (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) is a standard pulmonary test that is commonly done.  Discomforts  
include feeling lightheaded or short of breath while breathing out forcefully, cough or chest 
tightness/discomfort.  Although it is unusual to have any discomfort, breathing out forcefully may 
cause additional discomfort if the subject has back pain befor e the test. The inhaler medication 
albuterol is given as part of this test.  It is a short -acting medication that opens the airway.  The 
most common si de effects of albuterol include  feeling shaky or experiencing a slight tremor or 
feeling heart beat sligh tly faster.  
 
In pre -BD spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], if a participant has dyspnea triggered by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038], he will be allowed to 
use his own rescue albuterol inhaler.  Once the patient recovers, spi[INVESTIGATOR_700492] -BD spi[INVESTIGATOR_247190].  No albuterol will be administered by [CONTACT_21118].  
In post BD spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], if a participant has dyspnea triggered by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038], a study provider will 
be notified to assess the patient and need for further use of BD or medical evaluation.   
 
1.c.iv. Venip uncture :  With the blood draw, a small amount of bleeding may happen under the skin 
causing a bruise that may last up to a week. Rarely, a blood vessel from which blood was drawn 
may develop a blood clot. Such a clot is not serious and requires no treatmen t.  Also, in rare 
cases, fainting has occurred as a result of drawing blood.  These risks are the same as those 
associated with a standard venipuncture performed for clinical reasons.  
 
1.c.v. Walking exercise program:   Potential physical risks related to wa lking and exercise include:  
Subjects may experience l eg pa in, foot pain, back pain,  lightheadedness and/or  dizziness with 
increased  physical activity . 
 
 
Risks related to breathing  
Participants may experience shortness of breath while walking. This could be a sign of heart 
problems, but in most cases it  is likely due to low fitness or the underlying lung problem.  
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950950] diabetes.  An exercise program is an important 
part of managing diabetes. However, there are some risks, such as low blood sugar epi[INVESTIGATOR_700493] t.  
 
Risks related to blood pressure control  
Starting an exercise program may lower an individual’s blood pressure.  Participants who take 
medication to lower their blood pressure may need to have their blood pressure medication 
adjusted as they progress in the program. Likewise, participants who hav e poorly controlled blood 
pressure may experience raised blood pressure as they progress in the program.  
 
Risks related to hydration  
Participants who are on fluid restriction or diuretics may have trouble hydrating sufficiently when 
walking in hot weather . 
 
1.c.vi. Psychological Risks:  
The content of questionnaires and the study website are on topi[INVESTIGATOR_700494].   
 
1.c.vii. Social and Economic Risks :  
There is the potential for loss of confidentiality with the use of the Internet.   
Website  and Server :  The website is password protected and secured.  The server is on 
secured networks within the University of Michigan firewalls.  
We use many procedures to protect the research datab ase but despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104],  there is 
a chance that a person not connected with the study may gain access to the website  
information.  No protected health information (PHI) will be stored on the study server. The

contraceptive measure (an intrauterine device (IUD), oral contraceptives, barrier methods, or 
abstinence) for the previous three months, (ii) must have a negative pregnancy test, and (iii) must 
agree to continue to  use a contraception measure for the duration of the study. Women are 
considered to be of childbearing potential unless they have been surgically sterilized or are post -
menopausal, that is, no menstrual period for more than [ADDRESS_950952] sites (total hip, femoral neck radius) and told if they meet standard diagnostic criteria for 
osteopenia or osteo porosis. A report will be prepared that they will be asked to give to their usual 
healthcare provider . Any female participant who self -reports pregnancy or has a positive 
pregnancy test at any study visit will not perform the DXA scan and will have the option to 
discontinue participation in the research study.  
 
1.c.ix. Measure of body composition using bioimpedance (VA [LOCATION_011] site only):  To measure body 
fat levels using the Omron Healthcare Fat Loss Monitor (HBF -306CN) , a painless,  extremely low 
level of electrical current (50 kHz and 500 µA)  is used . Subjects who are pregnant are excluded 
from the DXA Scan and are therefore, also excluded from the bioimpedance measurement.  
Although likely safe for use in those with implanted medica l devices, we will exclude any subject 
with a pacemaker or defibrillator to minimize any potential risks. Before completing this 
assessment, the s tudy staff will complete a safety screening  that  includ es: 
• Asking if s/he has a pacemaker  and or defibrillato r 
• Requesting the subject empty the bladder beforehand  
 
If the subject has a pacemaker  or defibrillator , then the bioimpedance measurement will not be 
taken. The bioimpedance measurement is safe and painless, and is taken while  the subject is 
seated . The subject will grasp 2 handles on the fat loss monitor  for 5-10 seconds in the seated 
position  while a rea ding is taken. Three readings will be taken in this manner  to assess 
reproducibility . 
 
(2)  Adequacy of Protection from Risks  
 (a) Recruitment and Informed Consent :  Subjects will be recruited voluntarily.  At each 
recruiting site, we will enroll [ADDRESS_950953] aff.   
 
 (b)  Protection Against Risk s.   
  
Subjects will be eligible to participate in the study only if they have medical clearance from 
their healthcare provider to participate in an exercise program.  We estimate the total time of 
testing to be approximately [ADDRESS_950954] with a pacemaker or defibrillator to minimize any 
potential risks. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_700495] 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950955].  If hypoxemia, oxygen saturation <85%, is 
observed during the 6MWT, subjects will be temporarily excluded from further study par ticipation 
and their primary provider contact[CONTACT_452513].  These subjects can be reassessed for 
eligibility at a later date when clinically stable.  Hypoxemia and dyspnea predict balance 
impairment and falls in COPD; both are assessed right before the 6MWT is performed.  Also, if 
the subject is unsteady on his feet during the short walk to assess pedometer accuracy and is 
obviously a fall risk, the 6MWT will not be performed.   
Venipuncture will be performed by [CONTACT_700557].  Subjects  do not have to 
answer any questions on questionnaires with which they are uncomfortable.  Inadvertent 
disclosure of medical history information is guarded against by [CONTACT_700558] a locked filing system.  We will evaluate for dep ression with the Beck Depression 
Inventory.  Patients with a Beck total score > 14 will, with the patient’s permission, have their 
primary providers informed of the results, with the suggestion that they might consider referral for 
evaluation and/or treatm ent. Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_700496] 9 of the Beck’s, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_700497].  The clinical diagnosis of depressio n or anxiety will 
need to come from the participants’ mental health  or primary care providers, we are not 
diagnosing it in the research study.  
If subject has previously undergone a DXA scan at the VA [LOCATION_011] Osteoporosis Clinic 
within [ADDRESS_950956] does  not 
need to complete a scan specifically for the research study . 
During the study, subjects will be regularly monitored for adverse effects of exercise during 
clinic visits and telephone contacts.  In addition, participants can report adverse events (AdEs) by 
[CONTACT_700559].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_700498].  Subjects in both arm s will be 
instructed to notify study staff if they experience any change in their clinical condition, any change 
in medications, or have urgent care visits, emergency room visits, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  During the 
study, if a subject experiences a medical p roblem that prevents walking and exercise, he will be 
temporarily suspended from the study and will resume when at baseline clinical status.  Any AdEs 
that are immediately life -threatening, cause permanent or lasting harm, or require a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700499] a serious classification.  All serious adverse events (SAE) and unanticipated problems 
will be reported to the respective IRB at continuing review but  reported to the study DSMB 
immediately.  If an event is possibly, probably or definitely related  to the intervention, it will be 
classified as intervention -related.  Based upon our prior experience, the most common SAE will 
be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a COPD exacerbation.  The most common AdE will be musculoskeletal 
injuries.   
We have convened an indepen dent, external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
They will monitor the rates of AdEs and SAEs and unanticipated problems between the 2 arms of 
the study.  The DSMB is composed of Elizabeth Klings , MD an expert in pulmonary rehabilitation 
and COPD c linical trials at [LOCATION_011] Medical Center, Huong Nguyen, PhD an expert in telemedicine 
methods in COPD at Southern [LOCATION_004] Kaiser Permanente, and DorAn ne Donesky , RN, PhD,

months, and as needed, by [CONTACT_580109].   
 
(3) Potential Benefit of the Proposed Research to the Subject and Others.    
 
There is potentially great benefit to the large number of persons with COPD if the proposed 
work leads to the adoption of an Internet -mediated walking program to promote physical activity 
in clinical practice.  Such walking programs would be accessible to all who needed it and would  
improve short - and long -term outcomes.  Since risks of the study are minimal, and the societal 
benefits are potentially large, the risk -benefit ratio is strongly on the side of benefit.  There are no 
direct benefits to the subject.  
 
 Although not all part icipants may experience benefits, some of the potential benefits of 
participating in the study include more effective management of  COPD symptoms, increase d 
exercise capacity, and better quality of life.  
 
 Potential benefits to other s include contributing to the development  of an  accessible, 
individualized, and sustainable program  that incorporate s strategies for behavioral change for 
managing COPD symptoms to encourage physical activity in those with COPD.  
 
 The risks to the subjects are reaso nable in relation to the anticipated benefits to subjects and 
others because each participant is required to obtain medical clearance which indicates they are 
healthy enough to participate in a walking program. Additionally, walking carries minimal risk, a nd 
physical activity is part of usual care for managing COPD symptoms.  
 
(4) Importance of the Knowledge to Be Gained.    
  Although it is well known that greater physical activity is beneficial, it is unclear how to 
increase physical activity in persons with chronic disease such as COPD who already experience 
functional disability from their disease.  Novel strategies are need ed to promote physical activity 
and exercise in persons with COPD.  The proposed pedometer -based, Internet -mediated walking 
program is unique because of its automation, ability to accurately monitor walking performed, 
individualized step -count goals, and e ducational content and motivational messages.  We 
propose to rigorously assess the efficacy of the Walking and Education to Breathe (WEB)  exercise 
intervention in a randomized controlled study and to examine its effect on short - and long -term 
outcomes in C OPD.  These are the next steps needed to rigorously examine if WEB  works.   
 If successful in increasing 6MWT distance and improving short - and long -term outcomes, such 
a program would have a direct and positive impact on the way we currently care for pers ons with 
COPD.  Once implemented, such a program would be available to all persons with COPD who 
needed it, would individualize exercise training, and could promote walking indefinitely.  Based 
on published estimates that [ADDRESS_950957] C OPD and our preliminary data that 
33 to 64% of COPD patients are Internet users, our proposed intervention could help over [ADDRESS_950958] of those interventions on 
COPD outcomes.  Our highly clinically relevant intervention has the potential to (1) bring an 
exercise program to the vast majority of persons with COPD who cannot go to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based 
pulmonary rehabilitation program, (2) improve the effectiveness of current pulmonary 
rehabilitat ion programs, and (3) become an integral part of COPD self -management programs.  
Ultimately, the intervention could decrease risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], acute exacerbations, and 
COPD -related morbidity and mortality.

 Addendum to Protocol:  
Brain MRI Scan Substudy  
 
Rationale : COPD is the nation’s third leading cause of death and affects up to 11% of all VA 
healthcare patients .  Patients with COPD experience significant dyspnea despi[INVESTIGATOR_700506].  In addition, over half of patients with COPD experience chronic pain --largely 
musculoskeletal pain.  Clinically, in patients who suffer from both chronic pain an d dyspnea, it is 
difficult to distinguish a patient’s perception of one symptom, modulated or amplified by [CONTACT_27748], 
using self -report and questionnaires. Yet, it is critically important to differentiate them to make 
accurate diagnostic and treatment deci sions.  Patients who experience and report pain, 
heightened by [CONTACT_452504], may be overtreated with narcotics which can lead to 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_452470].   Similarly, a patient’s report of dyspnea, amplified 
by [CONTACT_700562], may lead to unnecessary testing for etiologies of dyspnea and 
undertreatment of pain.  To optimize clinical management, novel objective diagnostic tools are 
needed to complement patient self -report and accurately distinguish symptoms in patients who 
have combined chronic musculoskeletal pain and dyspnea.  
It is also important to understand chronic musculoskeletal pain and dyspnea because they 
are common barriers to engaging in PA and exercise.  The clinical course of COPD is 
characterized by a downward spi[INVESTIGATOR_452472], physical inactivity, and decondition ing.  Chronic 
musculoskeletal pain similarly leads to a negative cycle of physical inactivity and deconditioning, 
ultimately resulting in significant physical limitation.  Although chronic musculoskeletal pain and 
dyspnea can be barriers, PA and exercise a re powerful, but underused non -pharmacological 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_700507].  We developed Every Step Counts 
(ESC), a technology -mediated intervention based on the Theory of Self -Regulation, to promote 
PA in COPD.  ESC couples a pedom eter with a dynamic website that provides individualized step -
count goals, iterative feedback, education on disease self -management, motivation, and an online 
community of social support.  In two randomized studies in Veterans with COPD, we 
demonstrated ES C’s safety, feasibility, and efficacy to increase PA and improve health -related 
quality of life over 3 -4 months.  In preliminary studies using questionnaires, we showed that ESC 
can improve dyspnea.  In a separate study, the same PA platform has also been shown to relieve 
chronic back pain in Veterans.  An important next step is to understand  the effects of PA 
interventions, like ESC, in the many COPD patients with combined chronic musculoskeletal pain 
and dyspnea  to ultimately improve PA interventions and personalize treatment of symptoms.  
 
Background: Unique brain activity networks and specific structural changes in the brain are 
traditionally associated with chronic pain stimuli.  It has been shown that resting state functional 
connectivity , between the a nterior insular cortex and brainstem periaqueductal gray, determines 
pain perception in healthy humans.  Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance 
imaging (fcMRI) is used in  brain mappi[INVESTIGATOR_700508] a resting state, before a sensory event or when an explicit task is not 
being performed.   The resting pattern and strength of functional connectivity specifically within 
the “default mode” network (DMN) (posterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobe s, and medial frontal 
gyrus) have  been examined in several studies of clinical disease states, as this network is reliably 
detected and well -characterized.  The DMN is an anatomically defined brain system that is one of 
the most studied networks present during resting state and is one of the most easily visualized 
networks.  It is a critical network involved in many functions with high interconnectivity with other 
networks and could be a sensitive network to examine  in respon se to symptom changes .  These 
resting communications are altered in older adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain who show 
greater functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and left insula, superior temporal

 gyrus, and cerebellum.  Chronic m usculoskeletal pain in COPD has not been studied with 
neuroimaging.  
Currently, the central mechanisms of chronic musculoskeletal  pain and dyspnea, and how 
they change in response to PA promotion, in COPD are largely unknown.  Unique brain activity 
networks  and specific structural changes in the brain are traditionally associated with chronic pain 
stimuli.  It has also been shown that resting state functional connectivity determines pain 
perception in healthy humans.  Resting state fcMRI  evaluates interactio ns between brain regions 
before a sensory event or when an explicit task is not being performed.  These resting regional 
communications are  altered in older adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain.  Functional 
connectivity among regions specifically withi n the “default mode” network (DMN) (posterior 
cingulate, inferior parietal lobes, and medial frontal gyrus) have been examined in clinical disease 
states, as this network is reliably detected and well -characterized.  Resting state functional 
connectivity m ay be a novel biomarker, complementing patient self -report, that tracks the unique 
contributions of chronic pain and dyspnea to a patient’s symptom complex.  N o studies to date 
have examined the relationships between subjective measures of chronic pain and  dyspnea and 
objective measures of functional connectivity, or changes in these symptoms and functional 
connectivity in response to PA promotion in persons with COPD.   
 
Objective:  Assess the feasibility of conducting brain  fcMRI in persons with COPD and begin to 
understand the central mechanisms of chronic musculoskeletal  pain and dyspnea, and how they  
associate with physical activity . This will be done by [CONTACT_716]:  
(1) Recruit from persons who are currently or have previously pa rticipated in the WEB study  
to assess if they would participate in an additional in -person visit to complete an fcMRI 
scan assessment.  
(2) Recruit up to 20 of those persons willing to receive an MRI scan at VA [LOCATION_011] to assess 
feasibility of  obtaining  fcMRI an d gather  preliminary data  on the relationship s between 
patterns of functional connectivity and shortness of breath, chronic musculoskeletal pain, 
and physical activity  in COPD  to desig n a future study.  
 
Work Proposed:  
 
Recruitment:   An approved HIPAA waiver will allow contact [CONTACT_700563].  We will contact [CONTACT_700564] e is no 
response after 2 weeks.  Those who are in follow -up in the main study will be appro ached in 
person , and eligible and interested participants will sign a n ICF and HIPAA specific to the 
substudy.   For all participants in the substudy, the fcMRI can be done at the same visit as 
scheduled for the main study or during a separate visit depending on participant preference.   
 
Proposed MRI assessment:   Among those persons willing to participate in an MRI  scan 
assessment, we will ask up to 20 of these subjects to undergo a n fcMRI  scan at VA [LOCATION_011]. 
Participants will complete a dedicated VA consent form and HIPAA authorization for the MRI scan  
at the time of the MRI scan , as well as an MRI scan clearance for m. Scans will be performed in 
the Neuroimaging for Veterans Research Center (NeRVe) of the VA [LOCATION_011] Healthcare System , 
and a  clinical MRI technician will be  present for all scans.  
 
For the proposed substudy , additional exclusion criteria are:  
• Claustrophobia  
• History of seizures  
• Current diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizo phrenia, or psychotic disorder  
• Cognitive disorder  such as dementia  
Version 3.0

42 
 • Known metal in body including shrapnel, surgical medical clips, implants, pacemakers, or 
metal -based tattoos   
• Known or new brain lesions (including but not limited to brain cancer, metastatic cancer, 
subdural hematoma)  
 
Each scan will start with [ADDRESS_950976] breathing rate. Neuroimaging data will be acquired on a 3 -
Tesla Siemens (Erlangen, Germa ny) TIM Trio scanner, using a 32 -channel brain array.  Two 
multiecho MPRAGE (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo) T1 -weighted anatomical scans 
(1 mm isotropic) will be acquired for surface reconstruction, functional connectivity seed placement, 
and inter-participant registration.  Resting state functional connectivity data will be acquired in two 
runs using high temporal and spatial resolution sequences recently  developed for the Human 
Connectome Project Lifespan study.  
 
The scans performed in this s tudy are for specific research purposes and are not meant to find any 
medical abnormalities. The results from the research scan will not be routinely shared with the 
participant’s clinical provider , except upon the participant’s  request.   However, if the investigators 
or MRI technician notice any potential incidental finding, the scan will be reviewed by a clinical 
radiologist who will determine whether a clinical evaluation is warranted.  If there is a finding that 
warrants a clinical fol low-up, study personnel will discuss this with the participant .  If any abnormality  
on the MRI is noted by [CONTACT_16133], the participant will be notified to follow up with  his usual 
provider.  
 
Eligible subjects will also complete an MMRC Dyspnea Scal e assessment and the Brief Pain 
Inventory (short form)  before having the brain MRI .   
   
Persons will  receive $[ADDRESS_950977]’s  participation in the main study including name, address, date of birth, and 
information such as SSN, pulmonary function tests, lab oratory test  results , X-ray 
images/readings, exercise tests, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700509], emergency 
contact [CONTACT_3031], pulmonary rehabilitation evaluations, medical history, allergies, imaging 
studies and reports, procedure reports, d rug, alcohol, or STD treatment, genetic test results, or 
mental health treatment .   
 
Risks to Subjects : 
 
Potential Risks:  Neuroimaging with MRI Scanning: Minimal risks are associated with MRI 
scanning. Extended periods of time in the MRI scanner can become uncomfortable. Lying down 
in the MRI scanner may cause back discomfort or anxiety, particularly if the subject tends to b e 
claustrophobic.  There is a risk of falling getting on and off the scanner table.  There is no risk of 
ionizing radiation exposure with MRI.  
 
During the MRI procedure, participants will hear many different sounds. These sounds are sharp 
and repetitive an d can cause anxiety in some subjects. While they may be annoying, these sounds 
are not harmful to one ’s hearing.   
 
Version 3.0 
Date Revised:  6/21 /[ADDRESS_950978] Risks:  We will use all reasonable means to promote comfort including but -not 
limited to use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_700510].  Some people experienc e a "closed -in" feeling due to the 
relatively restricted space within the MRI machine. If a participant  should experience such 
feelings, he can let the researchers know by [CONTACT_452512].  He can do this at any 
time to stop the scan. We will minimize sharp sounds through the use of earplugs.  
 
All safety precautions will be reviewed with the subject immediately prior to having the MRI.  If 
there is any doubt as to whether the subject has metal in his body, he will be requested to have 
an X-ray to determine this. If the X -ray shows that there is metal in the participants, he will not be 
able to take part in the MRI study.  If there is more than one part of the body in which metal is 
questionable,  the participant will not be able to have an X -ray and will not be able to participate 
in the MRI study.  
 
Study staff will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_700511]. The criteria for discontinuing a subject’s partici pation in the neuroimaging protocol 
include the participant’s request, any potential for harm, and any life -threatening or potentially 
disabling unintended event, including syncope, an injurious fall, new or worsened symptoms of 
musculoskeletal pain, short ness of breath, or chest pain, hemodynamic instability, mental status 
changes, dysrhythmia, angina, myocardial infarction, or anaphylaxis.  These adverse events will 
be recorded and included in the database. Any subject who develops adverse events during t he 
conduct of study protocols will be given immediate medical c are and will be referred to his primary 
care physician for ongoing care.

Analytic Approach:  For neuroimaging, all analyses will be performed with complementary 
advanced imaging procedures for brain network mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], including seed -based and independent 
component analysi s procedures, to assure the robustness of the findings.  We will correlate 
neuroimaging data with clinical data  obtained at baseline in the main study, including 
demographics, dyspnea, chronic pain assessments, and daily step count as the measure of PA .  
We will perform secondary analyses to examine the potential influence of PA and clinical 
characteristics that may contribute to the findings.  We will be somewhat exploratory in our 
approach in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], while also being mindful of statistical con siderations. Our main 
image analyses will use robust and careful seed based DMN mappi[INVESTIGATOR_4585].  Analyses will 
account for known contributors to the fcMRI signal including motion, respi[INVESTIGATOR_700512].  Neuroimaging data will be processed us ing a combination of FreeSurfer.[ADDRESS_950980] will be

motion regressed from time series, regression of the global  mean and the average time courses 
from the white matter  and the ventricles, band pass filtering between 0.01 and 0.1  Hz).  Time 
points, runs, and sessions with excessive motion  will be excluded (0.5 mm/TR; 20 TRs/run; 30 
TRs/session).  Data will be sampled to and smoothed on the surface, and each brain will be 
warped to a surface -based template (fsaverage).  Seed regions will be derived from surface -
based parcellations of the cortex providing more robust anatomical representation for each 
participant.  The vertex -wise partial correlation to the seed will allow further group -level analyses.   
We will focus on the  DMN, but explore other networks including pain networks.  We will also 
explore resting state functional connectivity associated with the anticipatory symptom scenarios.  
 
Statistical analysis : 
Group average correlation maps will assess cross -sectional associatio ns between functional 
connectivity patterns and daily step count, dyspnea, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.  We will 
also explore differences in functional connectivity in those with predominantly pain versus those 
with predominantly dyspnea.   
 
Sample size/Power calculation : This is an exploratory proposal in a convenience sample of up to 
[ADDRESS_950982] application.

Title:A Phase 2B, 8-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel 
Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of the Fatty Acid 
Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) Inhibitor PF-04457845 in Adults with DSM-5 Current 
Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD)
Study Description:The efficacy, safety and tolerability of the FAAH Inhibitor PF-0447845 in reducing 
cannabis use will be studied in a 4-site randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, outpatient clinical trial comparing PF-04457845 (4mg) and placebo in 
DSM-5 CUD individuals. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either PF-
04457845 or placebo using random block sizes of 2 and 4, stratified by [CONTACT_216044] (CUD at the level of moderate (4-7 [of 11] symptoms) or 
severe (8-11 [of 11] symptoms)). Participants will receive motivational interviewing for 
[ADDRESS_259705] week of treatment. For a self-reported quit attempt, participants will be 
rewarded. Participants will receive active or placebo PF-04457845 for 8 weeks during 
which time they will be evaluated weekly with either in person or remote study visits. 
In addition, daily assessment of adherence to study medication and cannabinoid use 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_216045]. Measures of cannabinoid exposure, and problems 
related to the use of cannabis, will be assessed. 
Primary Objective:To determine whether PF-04457845 is superior to placebo in reducing self-reported 
frequency (number of times per day) of cannabis use.
Primary Endpoint:Change in the average number of times per day of self-reported cannabis 
consumption.
Study Population: Up to approximately 260 individuals diagnosed with DSM5 Cannabis Use Disorder
Phase: Phase 2B 
Description of Sites 
Enrolling 
Participants:This multi-center trial will take place at four sites: Yale University School of Medicine, 
Columbia University Medical Center, John Hopkins University, & Medical University of 
South Carolina.
Description of Study 
Interventions:For 8 weeks participants will receive 4mg daily of PF-04457845 or placebo.
Study Duration: The duration of this study is approximately 3 years.
Participant Duration:This trial is 14 weeks total, including: 1) a 2-week screening phase, 2) randomization 
to PF-04457845 or placebo for 8 weeks, and 3) a 4 week follow up phase for safety 
especially because the effects of the drug take ~ 2 weeks to washout.

2.1 Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is an increasingly recognized problem for which there 
are no FDA-approved or clinically-accepted pharmacological treatments: Cannabis is the 
most widely used illicit substance in the [LOCATION_002] (1) and globally. Globally, cannabis 
consumption has increased in the last quarter of the twentieth century (2). In the U.S., cannabis 
use rates have doubled in the last decade (3, 4) particularly in young people (5, 6). The 2015 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) estimated that 22.2 million Americans aged 
12 or older were current users of cannabis (7). Moreover, the NSDUH reported that 
approximately 4.[ADDRESS_259706] year. 
The legalization of “medical” and recreational cannabis use is sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_215951] U.S. (8, 9). 
To date, the District of Columbia and [ADDRESS_259707] also legalized cannabis for 
nonmedical (recreational use). The potency of cannabis has been steadily increasing (10), and 
a number of high-THC-containing products (e.g., wax, shatter) are commercially available. In 
parallel, there is growing recreational use of potent synthetic cannabinoids (11, 12). 
Diagnostic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], laboratory and clinical studies provide compelling evidence for 
the existence of a cannabis dependence syndrome, currently termed cannabis use disorder 
(CUD) in DSM-5, that is characterized by [INVESTIGATOR_140479] 1) the development of tolerance (13-16), 
2) the emergence of withdrawal symptoms on cessation of exposure (17-19), and 3) compulsive 
use, impaired control and continued use despi[INVESTIGATOR_215952] (20-22). Individuals with CUD have difficulty containing use, 
spend too much time or money acquiring, using, or recovering from the effects of cannabis, 
make many failed attempts to quit or reduce use, have cravings and a desire to use, and use in 
contexts that are potentially dangerous (e.g., driving). The regular use of cannabis has been 
associated with a number of negative outcomes including cognitive deficits (23-26), motor 
vehicle accidents (27, 28), psychiatric symptoms and disorders (29-32), poor quality of life (33) 
and substantial comorbidity and disability (34). While not all cannabis users experience 
problems, nearly 3 of 10 marijuana/cannabis users manifested a cannabis use disorder in 2012-
2013 (3). 
While cannabis may be less likely than other drugs to produce dependence, after alcohol, it 
has the highest rate of dependence or abuse among all drugs (1). In fact, it is twice as prevalent 
as cocaine or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (35) likely because more people use cannabis. Around 10% of people 
who use cannabis will become dependent on it (36, 37), and that increases to about 17 % in 
those who start using in their teens. In the US, cannabis was the illicit drug with the highest rate 
of past year dependence or abuse in 2009 (38) and there were more treatment admissions for 
cannabis related problems than for cocaine or heroin (39, 40). As reviewed by [CONTACT_216046]., 
chronic cannabis use is associated with many negative outcomes (41, 42) including cognitive 
dysfunction (43-48), psychosis (49), and possible structural brain abnormalities (50-56). 
There is increasing demand for effective treatments for CUDs. The US Treatment Epi[INVESTIGATOR_215953] (TEDS) reported that 17% of all admissions to substance abuse facilities were for 
cannabis (57), second only to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Further, this represents a doubling of the rate since 
1993. The rates of CUDs and CUD-related problems highlights the need for effective 
treatments. However, there are no FDA-approved or clinically-accepted pharmacological 
treatments for cannabis CUD as yet. 
2.2 Changes associated with cannabis use disorder: Exposure to natural and synthetic 
agonists of the brain cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) is associated with a number of changes 
manifesting as behavioral tolerance that is accompanied by [CONTACT_216047] 
(eCB) system. Furthermore, discontinuation following prolonged exposure to CB1R agonists 
leads to a withdrawal syndrome. The eCB system is a neuromodulatory system consisting of 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 16 of 116two G-protein–coupled receptors, CB1R and CB2R; lipid ligands including anandamide (AEA) 
and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG); and enzymes involved in eCB biosynthesis and degradation 
(fatty acid amide hydrolase [FAAH], monoacylglycerol lipase [MAG-L] and 2-
arachidonoylglycerol hydrolase [ABHD6]) (for reviews see (58-60)). eCBs are synthesized and 
released on demand, following which they travel back to activate presynaptic CB1Rs resulting in 
braking the further release of neurotransmitters. eCBs are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_215954] a transport 
system that is yet to be fully characterized. CB1Rs are critical in mediating the psychoactive 
effects of cannabis and are expressed mainly in the brain whereas CB2Rs are mostly 
expressed peripherally. 
2.3 Tolerance: In humans, tolerance develops to the effects of CB1R agonists on mood, 
memory and cognition, heart rate, blood pressure and hormones, etc., (61-66) and the 
magnitude of tolerance is proportional to the dose and duration of exposure. The rate and time-
course of the development of tolerance to the various effects of CB1R agonists varies. In 
animals, tolerance to the analgesic, hypothermic and hypomotor effects develop within days 
(67, 68), while tolerance to the memory (69) and endocrine effects (70) take longer to develop. 
Exposure to CB1R agonists is accompanied by [CONTACT_216048], desensitization of 
receptor-mediated G-protein activation, and alterations in CB1R mRNA levels (13, 19, 71-77). 
These changes have a distinct regional and temporal profile and are related to the duration and 
magnitude of exposure to cannabinoids (77-79). While CB1R downregulation occurs within 
days, there are regional differences in the time course of these changes. Hippocampal CB1Rs 
exhibit the greatest magnitude of desensitization and downregulation in response to repeated 
THC administration while striatal CB1R 
adaptations develop more slowly and 
recover more quickly than in regions such 
as the hippocampus (71, 74-77). 
It is now clear from in vivo brain 
imaging studies by [CONTACT_3019] ( Figure 1) and 
others that repeated cannabis exposure is 
associated with downregulation of CB1Rs 
which tends to “normalize” with prolonged 
abstinence (80-82). 
Furthermore, and specifically relevant 
to the mechanism of action of the proposed 
treatment, in a recent in vivo imaging study, 
Boileau et al., showed that FAAH binding 
measured with positron emission 
tomography and [11C]CURB was 
significantly lower by 14-20% in the brains 
of chronic cannabis users (83). Furthermore, lower FAAH binding was negatively correlated with 
measures of cannabis exposure ( cannabinoid concentrations in blood and urine). They 
suggested that lower FAAH binding levels in the brain may be a consequence of chronic and 
recent cannabis exposure and could contribute to cannabis withdrawal. Taken collectively, the 
lower FAAH binding in CUD may reflect a compensatory effort to increase AEA in response to 
low CB1R availability with chronic cannabis exposure. 
Interestingly, in animals, prolonged activation of CB1Rs with THC leads to decreased AEA 
levels in the striatum (84), and consistent with these findings, human cannabis users show 
reduced cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_215955] (85). Thus, an alternative explanation for the low FAAH 
binding in chronic cannabis users, is that it might reflect an attempt to compensate for the 
reduction in striatal AEA levels associated with chronic downregulation of AEA release. Thus, if

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 17 of 116reduced FAAH activity reflects a compensatory attempt to maintain endocannabinoid tone, 
treatment with inhibitors of FAAH, might be beneficial. 
2.4 Cannabis withdrawal syndrome: Abrupt discontinuation of CB1R agonists in cannabinoid 
dependent animals or the administration of CB1R antagonist to cannabinoid dependent animals 
leads to a withdrawal syndrome (86-91). In humans, a cannabis withdrawal syndrome has been 
reported from retrospective self-report studies  (72), prospective outpatient studies (73, 74), and 
human laboratory studies involving the administration  and discontinuation of cannabinoids (49, 
50, 75, 76). The typi[INVESTIGATOR_215956],  aggression, appetite change, 
weight loss, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, altered sleep, strange dreams,  cannabis craving 
and physical discomfort (11, 49, 50, 73, 75, 77-80). Most symptoms appear within 1 day of 
abstinence, peak within  2–3 days, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_40167] 1–2 weeks. However, other 
studies (73, 80) suggest that withdrawal symptoms may persist longer than [ADDRESS_259708] for longer (92-94). Characteristic of a true withdrawal 
syndrome, abstinence symptoms occur with blind discontinuation and resolve with CB1R 
agonist re-administration (49, 75, 77, 81, 82). Avoidance of CWS might be one factor that 
contributes to the persistence of chronic cannabis use, and thus, medications that attenuate 
CWS may also improve treatment outcomes among individuals with CUD.
2.5 Sleep disturbances are an important manifestation of cannabis withdrawal: Several 
lines of experimental evidence suggest a role of CB1R in sleep (95, 96); therefore, it is not 
surprising that sleep disturbance is a common symptom of cannabis withdrawal and is clinically 
meaningful. About 76% of daily cannabis users who abruptly discontinue the use of cannabis 
report sleep disturbance (92, 93, 97). Difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_215957]-study reliability (92). These generally occur within [ADDRESS_259709] for 6–7 weeks (93, 98). Resumption of cannabis use 
or administration of oral THC improves sleep or even reinstitutes subjectively normal sleep (66, 
99-102). Sleep disturbance is reported as a reason why individuals resume smoking cannabis 
(103) or use alcohol, sedative/hypnotic drugs, or illicit drugs in attempts to treat their sleep 
disturbance (98, 104). Similarly, certain drugs of abuse may be more rewarding in insomniacs 
(105), and preferred to a greater degree in persons who are sleep-restricted or deprived (106-
108). 
However, self-reports do not always accurately reflect actual sleep quality e.g. (109) and do 
not provide information about sleep architecture. A number of studies have used 
polysomnography (PSG) to complement  self-report measures of sleep and to study sleep 
architecture during the period immediately following the  abrupt cessation of cannabis use reviewed 
in (110-113). PSG studies of cannabis withdrawal have demonstrated increases in sleep onset 
latency and wakefulness after sleep onset reviewed in (110-112, 114-117). Total sleep time (TST), 
sleep efficiency (SEff), and slow-wave sleep (SWS) time is reduced (111, 112, 115, 118, 119). 
REM sleep is increased (REM rebound) (99, 114, 116-118, 120) and REM latency is shorter 
(111, 114). Changes in sleep architecture during CWS can begin as early as the first night of 
abstinence (118). Changes during withdrawal are more evident in heavy users (111). With 
continued abstinence, TST, SEff, and amount of REM sleep decline, while wake after  sleep 
onset (WASO) increases. These disturbances progress over the first 2 weeks of cannabis 
abstinence (93, 97, 111) and persist for more than ~6 weeks (93). PSG evidence of sleep 
disturbance  increase, as levels of THC-COOH decrease, suggesting an association between 
declining levels of cannabis  and increasing sleep disturbance. Furthermore, quantity 
(joints/week) and duration (years) of cannabis use  were positively associated with more PLMs. 
Vandrey et al., replicated most of the findings of Bolla et al.,  except that they showed increased 
sleep latency and time spent in REM sleep (14) which may be a result of  differences in the 
samples studied. As stated by [CONTACT_216049]: “The treatment of sleep  disturbance is a potential target for 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 18 of 116the management of cannabis use disorders since poor sleep could  contribute to treatment 
failure in heavy MJ users” (112).
Relief of withdrawal is a negative reinforcer for continued substance use (102, 103). 
Thus, individuals who experience CWS may use cannabis to relieve or avoid withdrawal 
(16). Since CWS may serve as negative reinforcement for relapse to cannabis use (121, 
122), treatments aimed at alleviating cannabis withdrawal might prevent relapse and 
reduce dependence. 
2.6 There is a need for effective treatments for cannabis use disorder: In parallel with the 
increase in  cannabis use disorders, there is increasing demand for effective treatments for 
cannabis use  disorders. For example, the percentage of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215958] 1993 and 2004 doubled  (105). 
2.6.1 Psychotherapeutic approaches: Despi[INVESTIGATOR_215959], these 
approaches which include motivational enhancement (MET), motivational interviewing (MI), 
cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) and contingency management (CM) have had limited 
success reviewed in(17, 123). Most CUD patients do not achieve abstinence with these 
interventions (124-127). Even with the most efficacious treatment – combination of MET, CBT 
and CM, only ~50% achieve an initial 2-week period of abstinence, and of those who do, about 
half relapse within a year (128, 129). 
 2.6.2 Pharmacotherapeutic approaches: As reviewed by [CONTACT_216050]., (2005), precipi[INVESTIGATOR_215960] (CWS) in laboratory animals has been used to test the 
efficacy of various drugs (THC, clonidine, prostaglandin E2, and lithium) (130-133). The results 
of these animal studies have provided the rationale for some of the clinical trials in humans. 
Almost every class of psychotropic drug has been tested for CUD (134-139) including drugs 
that 1) directly target the CB-1R system such as CB-1R agonists e.g., 9-delta-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to substitute cannabis (101, 102, 140, 141), Nabiximols (142), 
Sativex (143) or CB1R antagonists to block cannabis effects (144, 145), 2) Anti-depressants: 
Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (146), Nefazodone (147, 148), Fluoxetine (149), Escitalopram (150),Venlafaxine 
(151), Lofexidine (152), Baclofen (153) and Mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (154), Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331] (155-157), and 
Vilazodone (158), 3) Mood stabilizers: Lithium (159) and Divalproex (101, 160), 4) 
Antipsychotics: Pericyazine (161), Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (162), Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (163), 5) Other drugs: 
Gabapentin (164), Naltrexone (165-169), N-acetylcysteine (170, 171), Atomoxetine (172, 173), 
Entacapone (174) and some unpublished reports of pregnenolone, cannabidiol (CBD), 
Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], Citicholine, Guanfacine, Progesterone, and Nabilone. 
Most pharmacological trials have focused on the initial and immediate goal of alleviating the 
unpleasant abstinence symptoms associated with CWS. Few studies have targeted the long-
term goal of relapse prevention or reducing consumption. The study designs were mostly 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counter balanced, with the exception of a few 
open label studies (139). The studies had small sample sizes (mean 60, range 6-300 
participants) and were of varying duration (1-13 weeks). None of the medications that have 
been tested for cannabis withdrawal and/or dependence have been shown to be consistently 
effective (134-139, 155, 175, 176). Most of the approaches yielded negative results. The few 
that did yield promising results have not all been consistently replicated. The evidence base for 
the gabapentin and N-acetylcysteine while showing some promise needs further investigation. 
Substitution treatment with CB1R agonists (e.g., THC) reduces cannabis withdrawal in a dose-
dependent manner (101, 102, 141). However, the reduction in cannabis withdrawal does not 
appear to translate into any reduction in relapse but may result in higher treatment retention 
(141). However, CB1R agonists such as THC and Nabilone have potent psychoactive effects 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page [ADDRESS_259710] been shown to exhibit reinforcing 
properties in cannabis users, suggesting that abuse liability remains a concern with substitution 
therapy (177). Furthermore, substituting cannabis with THCs does not address the underlying 
changes in CB1R function associated with CUD. Thus, at present there are no FDA approved 
or clinically-accepted pharmacological treatments for cannabis use disorders.
2.7 Potentiating endocannabinoid signaling as a treatment for CUD: The endogenous 
cannabinoid system consists of at least two receptor subtypes (CB1R and CB2R) and several 
endogenous signaling molecules (endocannabinoids = eCBs) that bind to these receptors (178, 
179). The two best characterized endogenous ligands, anadamide (AEA) and 2-
arachindonoylglycerol (2-AG) are synthesized from membrane phospholipid precursors on-
demand by [CONTACT_216051] N- Acylphosphatidylethanolamine-selective phospholipase D (NAPE-
PLD) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), respectively.
Endocannabinoids are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_215961]. Endocannabinoid 
function can be potentiated via several pathways including by [CONTACT_216052], anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG. Levels of AEA and 2-AG are regulated by [CONTACT_216053], degrading enzymes, and transporters. Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) is the 
primary enzyme for hydrolysis of AEA (180-183). Thus, AEA levels can be increased by 
[CONTACT_216054]. Genetic deletion of the FAAH gene or pharmacological inhibition of FAAH 
activity impairs AEA hydrolysis, resulting in up to 10-fold increases in brain AEA levels (184, 
185). FAAH knockout mice exhibit normal CB1R expression despi[INVESTIGATOR_215962] (186, 187). FAAH knockout mice also display 
wild-type behavioral responses in most tests, with mild to moderate hypoalgesic and anxiolytic-
like phenotypes (188, 189). There are a number of FAAH inhibitors available including URB597, 
OL-135, PF-04457845 and PF-622 reviewed in(190). FAAH Inhibitors have shown promising 
therapeutic efficacy in a variety of pathologies (191) without the psychoactive effects or the 
abuse liability of cannabis (192-194) and PF-04457845 has shown promising results for CUD. 
2.8 Compared to THC, increased anandamide levels produce lower adaptive changes at 
the CB1R: Anandamide and THC might differentially regulate CB1Rs. When FAAH-knockout 
mice were repeatedly administered equivalent maximally effective doses of anandamide or 
THC, those given THC demonstrated reduced cannabinoid-stimulated G-protein activity and 
receptor binding levels, which was associated with tolerance to in vivo effects and CB1R 
antagonist-precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2613] (187). In contrast, repeated anandamide administration 
produced receptor levels and receptor-mediated G-protein activity intermediate between 
vehicle- and THC-treated FAAH-knockout mice. Rimonabant precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162] a markedly reduced 
withdrawal in FAAH knockout mice treated sub-chronically with anandamide as compared with 
mice treated repeatedly with THC. Collectively, these findings suggest that unlike repeated 
exposure to direct acting CB1R agonists, repeated anandamide administration is not associated 
with the CB1R adaptive changes.
2.[ADDRESS_259711] several advantages over THC or cannabis: 
2.9.1 FAAH-inhibitors are not rewarding: Animals treated sub-chronically with the FAAH inhibitor 
URB597 do not show CB1R antagonist precipi[INVESTIGATOR_215963], 
FAAH inhibitors do not induce dependence (195). Furthermore, URB597 does not elicit 
conditioned place preference (196) and also does not generalize in rats trained to discriminate 
the drug effects of THC (193, 196). Also, unlike THC, URB597 is not self-administered by 
[INVESTIGATOR_57183] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 20 of 116monkeys does not prime reinstatement, and fails to increase self-administration in monkeys 
receiving either THC or cocaine (192). FAAH inhibitors such as URB597 do not elicit rewarding 
effects in the conditioned place preference test, and are not self-administered by [CONTACT_216055] 
(192). Furthermore, PF-04457845 does not elicit effects on motility, catalepsy and body 
temperature, which are the signature [CONTACT_216175] (197). 
2.9.[ADDRESS_259712] negative interactions with THC: Despi[INVESTIGATOR_215964] 10-fold above that of the wild-type animals, FAAH-deficient 
mice have previously been demonstrated to display similar responses to acute THC 
administration in a battery of cannabinoid-sensitive behaviors as wild-type animals (184). This 
has some important implications for the use of FAAH inhibitors in individuals who are using 
cannabis, suggesting that in individuals receiving FAAH inhibitor treatment there should be no 
safety concerns if they were to use cannabis (relapse).
2.9.[ADDRESS_259713] several advantages: The approach of substituting cannabis with 
THC or other direct acting CB1R agonists for CUD essentially creates a state of controlled 
dependence without addressing the underlying adaptive changes associated with CUD. 
Compared to THC or cannabis, FAAH inhibitors 1) do not have psychoactive effects, 2) are not 
rewarding, 3) do not increase the abuse liability of other addictive drugs, and 4) are not 
associated with tolerance or withdrawal.

PF-04457845, a potent and selective FAAH-inhibitor, is an orally active, long-acting, time-
dependent, highly efficacious and selective covalent inhibitor of FAAH (198-201). It has 
undergone preclinical and clinical (phase 2) testing by [CONTACT_4618]. PF-04457845 inhibits human 
FAAH with high potency (kinact/Ki = [ZIP_CODE] M-1s-1; IC50 = 7.2 nM). 
3.1 Animal Studies: PF-04457845 has potent and long lasting antinociceptive effects in rats 
with oral administration. At 1 mg/kg PF-04457845 displays in vivo efficacy for over 24 hours with 
concomitant FAAH-inhibition, elevation of brain and plasma anandamide, N-palmitoyl

3.2 Human Phase 1 Studies: Randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Phase [ADDRESS_259715] been 
conducted in healthy male participants (n=64), aged 
21 to 55 to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics (PD), and tolerability of single 
and multiple oral doses of PF- 04457845 in healthy 
participants. Dose regimens included single doses 
from 0.1 to 40 mg and multiple doses from 0.5 to 8 
mg once daily (QD) for 14 days. Blood and urine 
were collected for PK analysis.
3.2.1 Pharmacokinetics: With single doses, absorption 
of PF-04457845 is rapid, and concentrations peak (C max) within an average of [ADDRESS_259716] 
dose. Elimination of PF-04457845 is multi-phasic, with a half-life (t1/2) ranging from 12-[ADDRESS_259717] parent was negligible. PK is commensurate with QD 
dosing.
3.2.2 Pharmacodynamics: Peripheral FAAH activity was measured ex vivo in blood leukocytes. 
Plasma concentrations of anandamide, PEA, OEA and N-linoleoylethanolamide (LEA) were 
measured as pharmacodynamic biomarkers. PEA, OEA, and LEA may have anti-inflammatory, 
sleep inducing, and appetite inducing effects. Inhibition of FAAH activity and elevation of a 
number of fatty acids has been demonstrated with single and multiple doses. Pharmacological 
washout takes 10 days after multiple dosing with 4 mg due to a combination of the time it takes 
for the drug to clear and the time that it takes for FAAH activity to recover. This slow 
pharmacological washout may offer the advantage of being less likely to result in withdrawal 
symptoms.
The effects of 5 doses of PF-04457845 (0, 0.5, 1, 4 and 8 mg) on cognitive function were 
tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of healthy 
volunteers ([COMPANY_007]; on file). Participants were repeatedly assessed several times a day and 
several days over 2 weeks using the CogState battery, a battery that assesses psychomotor 
function, visual attention, learning, executive function, and delayed recall, as well as a global

after 56 participants completed the study; 36 participants received PF-04457845 (4-mg) for 2 
weeks. PF-04457845 was well tolerated in patients with OA, with a safety profile that was 
indistinguishable from  placebo. The study was conducted in 5 centers in Canada, Sweden, and 
the [LOCATION_002] of America and  randomized 76 participants. During the study, no participant 
died or had a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). No participant was permanently withdrawn due to 
an Adverse Event (AE). A total of 136 AEs (all causalities) were reported in 51%, 58%, and 51% 
of participants treated with PF-04457845, naproxen, and placebo, respectively. There were  no 
clinically significant trends or clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests, vital 
signs  measurements, or ECG findings. Most AEs (97) were mild in severity; 31 AEs were 
moderate, and 2 AEs  were severe (nightmare and headache in the placebo treatment group). 
Furthermore, PF-04457845 caused substantial increase in all of the FAAH concentrations 
(means of 3.4 to 13.5-fold increases) compared to placebo.

3.4.1 Pharmacokinetics: Plasma was sampled to assay levels of PF-04457845 by [CONTACT_216057] (GVK Sciences) in a subset of participants using a proprietary method 
with permission from [COMPANY_007]. While PF-04457845 could not be detected in the placebo group, 
there were significantly higher levels in the PF-04457845 group across all timepoints except 
after the discontinuation of treatment (week 5) ( Figure 6). Figure 5: Consort Diagram for Preliminary Study

AEA that were expected to increase 
following treatment with PF-04457845 
were assayed in a subset of 
participants by [CONTACT_216058]. Relative to the placebo 
group, plasma levels of AEA, PEA 
and OEA were higher in the PF-
04457845 group on days 0, 2, and 4, 
and weeks 2, 3, and 4, but not at 
baseline (day -1) and after the 
discontinuation of treatment (week 5) 
(Figure 7, Table 5). These results 
demonstrate target engagement 
of PF-04457845 in CUD individuals. 
Taken together, the levels of PF-
04457845 and AEA provide 
confirmation of 1) adherence to 
treatment and 2) target specific effects of PF-04457845. Similarly, PF-04457845 also produced 
significant increases in plasma oleoylethanolamine (OEA) levels ( Table 5).
3.4.3 Adherence: Adherence to study medication was visually confirmed to be at least 95% of 
higher as reported elsewhere (203). Concordance between expected and actual remaining 
study medication counted at weekly study visits was 87.69% and as noted above, participants 
assigned to active study medication had detectable plasma drug levels, and increases in serum 
endocannabinoid levels, while those assigned to placebo did not.
3.4.4 Cannabis Withdrawal Inpatient: As a 
reminder, only participants with a previous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_215967], and 
all participants were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215968]. There were significant 
interaction effects between drug and time 
(Wald (4)=24.408, p<0.001) and between drug, 𝜒2
time, and desire to quit (Wald (4)=14.790, 𝜒2

cannabis withdrawal scores in the FAAH-I vs. 
placebo-treated group on day 0 (p Adj=0.048) and 
day1 (p Adj =0.035), the first and second days of 
treatment. No other comparisons survived multiple comparisons correction.
3.4.5 Cannabis Use: At the end of treatment (4 weeks) there was a significant main effect of 
drug (Wald (1)=13.371, p<0.001) such that the PF-04457845 treated group had lower 𝜒2
cannabis use compared to the placebo group ( Figure 9). Of note, mean cannabis use in the PF-
04457845 treated group was below 1 joint/day at the end of the treatment. Furthermore, there Figure 6: Plasma PF-04457845 Levels

screening, during inpatient stay (Day 0, Day 4), at all weekly appointments during treatment, 
and during follow up phase (Week 8). Participants monitored by [CONTACT_216062] ~1 week long inpatient phase. Participants were evaluated by a study doctor at 
all outpatient visits. There were no serious adverse events associated with this trial. The rates of 
minor adverse events were no different between the 2 groups ( Table 8). The DSMB met every 6 
months and had no concerns nor recommendations.
3.4.10 Summary of Preliminary Study Results: The completed preliminary double-blind, 
randomized placebo-controlled study with PF-04457845 in DSM-4 cannabis dependent (CUD) 
participants demonstrated: 1) the capacity to recruit and retain cannabis use disorder 
participants; 2) the capacity to visually confirm study medication adherence, a critical 
prerequisite for interpreting clinical trials data, using a simple, inexpensive and novel approach; 
3) biological confirmation of medication adherence (plasma PF-04457845 levels), 4) biological 
confirmation of target engagement (increased AEA levels), 4) a reduction in cannabis use, 
urinary THC-COOH, cannabis withdrawal, mood disturbances with PF-04457845 treatment, 5) a 
normalization of disturbances in stage N3 sleep measured by [CONTACT_25899] (PSG) with PF-
04457845, and 6) excellent tolerability and safety.

4.2 Endpoints: 
There is no established endpoint for CUD in the literature. Furthermore, there is no US FDA 
approved drug treatment for CUD that could provide guidance on selection of an endpoint. Most 
previous studies have used some measure of cannabis exposure as an endpoint. 
4.2.1 Primary Endpoint: 
There are significant problems to accurately measuring the amount of cannabis exposure. 
Cannabis and cannabinoids may be used by [CONTACT_74639], vapi[INVESTIGATOR_215969]. Even within 
smoking, cannabis and cannabinoids may be smoked as joint, blunt, bowl, etc. There are no 
standard units of consumption: joints come in different shapes and sizes. The potency (THC 
content) and the THC:CBD ratio can vary considerably. Finally, urine toxicological estimation of 
exposure is also fraught with challenges, especially if abstinence is not the goal. Given these 
challenges to measuring amount of use, self-reported frequency of use has been chosen as an 
endpoint. 
Specifically, the change from baseline to the last 4 weeks of the treatment phase in the 
average number of occasions per day of self-reported consumption of cannabis and 
cannabinoids captured using the daily TLFB data collected during CAROMA calls. A cannabis 
use occasion is defined as every time a participant initiates the use of cannabis. This will differ 
based on the method of use (see below). For example, if a participant uses blunts, or joints, 
every time he/she lights the joint, will be counted as one occasion. Baseline is defined as the 
last two weeks before the second screening visit; specifically, this is the TLFB capturing last 
week use done at the day -7 screening visit and the day of randomization.

5.1 Study Design: The efficacy, safety and tolerability of the Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase 
(FAAH) Inhibitor PF-04457845 in adults with DSM-5 current Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) will 
be evaluated in a 4-site (Columbia University, Johns Hopkins, Medical University of South 
Carolina and Yale University), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
outpatient clinical trial comparing PF-04457845 (4mg) and placebo DSM-5 CUD individuals 
(Table 1). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either PF-04457845 or placebo using 
a random block sizes of 2 and 4, stratified by [CONTACT_216070] (CUD at the level 
of moderate (4-7 [of 11] symptoms) or severe (8-11 [of 11] symptoms)) based on DSM5 criteria. 
These variables were chosen because they are the most likely to strongly affect outcomes 
measures. The trial includes a 1) 2-week screening phase, 2) 8-week treatment phase 
(randomization to PF-04457845 or placebo) for, and 3) 4-week follow up phase (for safety 
especially because the effects of the drug take ~ 2 weeks to washout). The duration of the 
treatment phase was chosen because the available toxicity data that [COMPANY_007] has collected is up 
to [ADDRESS_259727] 2 days of taking study medication. Participants 
will receive motivational interviewing to facilitate a quit attempt and will be rewarded for a 
successful attempt. 
5.2 Study Population: Approximately 260 total participants (target of approximately 65 
participants at each of the four participating sites based on competitive enrollment) of both 
genders and all ethnic/racial and socioeconomic backgrounds will be randomized for a total of 
178 participants completing the study (approximately 45 subjects per site). All patients will meet 
DSM-5 criteria for cannabis use disorder. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria is further 
described in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. Final determination for eligibility will be made by [CONTACT_204816]’s principal investigator. 
5.3 Duration: Screening activities will be completed up to approximately 14 days (up to a 
maximum of 60 days) prior to randomization on the Week 1 visit. The total duration of this study

6.3 Concomitant Interventions: Participants must be instructed to not take any medications, 
including over-the counter products, vitamins, or supplements during the study without first 
consulting with and getting the approval of the investigator. 
Similarly, since specific behavioral treatments developed for cannabis dependence e.g., 
MET or CBT may increase abstinence (17, 123), and in doing so obscure the effects of a 
medication treatment, participants will be asked to refrain from starting any such treatment until 
after completing the trial. Participants always have the option of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_215971].
6.3.1 Pharmacokinetic interactions with PF-04457845: In vitro studies using recombinant human 
cytochrome P450 (CYPs) enzymes suggest that CYP3A4 is the predominant isoform 
responsible for the oxidative metabolism of PF-04457845.  Therefore, drugs that induce or 
inhibit CYP3A4 may reduce or increase PF-[ADDRESS_259731] provides some, but not all, of the drugs knows to induce or inhibit CYP3A4:

6.3.2 Pharmacodynamic interactions with PF-04457845: Due to the mechanism of action as 
selective inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase, pharmacodynamic drug interactions may be 
hypothesized for the following compounds or situations: metabolic diseases such as abdominal 
obesity and associated metabolic changes, and diabetes; β-amyloid-linked events; Huntington’s 
disease; sedative use; and other compounds influencing the endocannabinoid system such as 
cannabinoid receptor ligands (rimonabant); use of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs.  As a 
result of the above hypothetical pharmacodynamic interactions special care may have to be 
taken when PF-04457845 is administered to patients with a background of metabolic diseases 
and use of sedatives and other CNS active compounds such as analgesics / anti-
inflammatories. None of these are absolute contraindications.  In the absence of 
pharmacodynamic studies, clinical judgement will need to be exercised to determine the 
risk:benefit of other drugs taken concomitantly with PF-04457845.
6.4 Contraception: Participants will be provided with information on acceptable methods of 
contraception as part of the informed consent process, and will be required to use one of the 
below approved methods of contraception for the duration of the study. Participants will be 
asked to inform the study staff immediately if either they or their sexual partner has become 
pregnant while participating in the study. Participants will be asked to document their method of 
contraception and sign to acknowledge that they will continue to use contraception from signing 
of consent until two weeks after the last dose of study medication.
6.4.1 Male Participants: From signing of informed consent until [ADDRESS_259732] agree to use barrier contraception (e.g. a condom with or without 
spermicidal cream or jelly). In addition, they must be advised not to donate sperm during this 
period.

study medication, female participants of childbearing potential (Women of Child Bearing 
Potential: WOCBP) who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must use a highly 
effective method of contraception (from the list below). In addition, they must be advised not to 
donate ova during this period.

include: double barrier contraception or a combination of a barrier contraception and a hormonal 
implant, injectable, combined oral contraceptive, or a male partner who has had a vasectomy; 
IUD or tubal ligation. 
6.5 Pregnancy: If any participant is found to be pregnant during the study, participation in the 
treatment phase must be immediately terminated. The participant should stop taking the study 
medication and return any remaining study medication as soon as possible. If possible, the 
participant should complete the follow up phase which is to collect safety data. Furthermore, the 
investigator should make every effort to ensure that the participant has established follow up 
care with a medical provider (OBGYN). The pregnancy should be followed up by [CONTACT_216073] (including spontaneous or voluntary termination), details of 
birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and/or newborn complications. 
6.6 Randomization Criteria: Participants who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
randomized at the time of the Week 1 visit in a 1:1 ratio of PF-04457845 to placebo using 
random block sizes of 2 and 4, stratified by [CONTACT_216070] (CUD at the level of 
moderate (4-7 [of 11] symptoms) or severe (8-11 [of 11] symptoms)) based on DSM-[ADDRESS_259734] outcomes 
measures. Random treatment assignment will be done using a centralized randomization 
process.
6.7 Enrollment: 
Participants will be enrolled 
at each site by [CONTACT_155489] (or at a rate of 
approximately 8 subjects 
per month or about 2 
subjects per month per site) 
until up to approximately

composed of as close to70% men and 30% women as possible. Additionally, the sample will be 
composed of approximately 4% American Indian/Alaska Native, 6% Asian, 30% Black or African 
American, 50% White, and 9% greater than one race. Please refer to Table 11 for planned 
inclusion enrollment broken down by [CONTACT_216074]. To ensure that these ethnic and racial 
divides are met, each site will submit to the Coordinating Center periodic enrollment reports 
(every 6 months). The Coordinating Center will then instruct each site on which ethnic 
categories still need to be met.

6.9 Screen Failures: Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in 
the clinical trial but are not subsequently randomized to the study intervention or entered in the 
study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of 
screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 
publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. If the participant 
is found to be ineligible at Screening, the investigator should complete the source document. 
Minimal information includes demographics, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any 
serious adverse events (SAE). Subject ID numbers assigned to participants who fail screening 
should not be reused.
The primary reason for screen failure should be recorded in the source document using one of 
the following categories: 
Adverse Event.
Did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria (specify reason).
Important protocol deviation.
Lost to follow-up.
Voluntary withdrawal (specify reason).
Other (specify reason).
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) may be 
rescreened if the reason that they were excluded is no longer an issue (e.g., an underage 
participant who now falls within the permitted age range, or a participant who has stopped 
taking a prohibited medication). However, participants who were initially screen failures cannot 
be rescreened for this study more than twice. Rescreened participants should be assigned the 
same participant number as for the initial screening.

7.1 Allocation to Treatment: Participants will be assigned a unique subject ID number that will 
be recorded in the randomization log. Then, prior to dosing, a randomization number will be 
allocated. This number will be retained throughout the study and will correspond to a treatment 
schedule determined by a randomization code. Participants will be made aware that there is a 
50% chance that they will receive a placebo as a part of this research protocol. 
All randomizations will be maintained centrally by [CONTACT_5081], using the 
REDCap application. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 manner. The randomizations will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_216076] (CUD at the level of moderate (4-7 [of 11] 
symptoms) or severe (8-11 [of 11] symptoms)) based on DSM-5 criteria. 
7.2 Breaking the Blind: All study personnel will be blinded to the study treatment. To minimize 
the potential for bias, treatment randomization information will be kept confidential and will not 
be released to the investigator or investigator site personnel until after the study database has 
been locked. 
At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind. Blinding codes will only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of participant 
safety, where knowledge of treatment allocation is necessary to provide emergency care. 
Whenever possible, the investigator or co-investigator should consult with a member of the 
Coordinating Center prior to breaking the blind. When the blinding code is broken, the date, 
time, and reason the blind is broken must be fully documented in the source documents. 
To preserve the blind, blood will be sampled for PF-[ADDRESS_259736] been randomized to PF-04457845 or placebo. 
7.3 Dose Selection: Given the FAAH inhibition mechanism and our understanding of the 
PK/PD relationship, if >95% inhibition of FAAH is not achieved, AEA levels are not 
reliably/robustly elevated. The minimum dose of PF-04457845 that produced >95% FAAH 
inhibition was 4 mg QD PF-04457845. PK at steady-state is dose-proportional. There are no 
major food effects on PF-04457845. Pharmacological washout takes 10 days after multiple 
dosing with 4mg due to a combination of the time it takes for drug clearance and FAAH activity 
recovery; the slow washout may offer the advantage of being less likely to result in withdrawal 
symptoms. The dose of 4mg PF-04457845 /day produces the maximal inhibition of FAAH, is 
safe as shown in the preliminary study, and furthermore, a higher dose does not afford any 
advantage.
7.4 Dose Administration: PF-04457845 (4mg) or matching placebo capsules will be taken by 
[CONTACT_216077]. Exceptions about the time that the 
participant takes the study medication may be made at the discretion of the investigator if taking 
the study medication under observation (see below) conflicts with the participant’s schedule 
(e.g., work). The study medication is not yet approved by [CONTACT_216078]. This study will be conducted under an existing IND (#114,017). This will be 
explained to participants prior to signing the informed consent document. 
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability:
7.5.1 Acquisition and Accountability: To note, the study medication for this clinical trial was 
initially owned by [CONTACT_216079], Inc. Ownership of the PF-04457845 study 
medication was transferred from SpringWorks to Jazz Pharmaceuticals as of October 
2020.Upon receipt of the PF-04457845/placebo capsules from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, the site 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215973] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page [ADDRESS_259737] should be filed in the investigator’s essential 
document file.
The investigator at each site must maintain 100% accountability for all drug received and 
dispensed during the site’s participation in the study. Proper drug accountability includes, but is 
not limited to:
Continuously monitoring expi[INVESTIGATOR_215974]
Frequently verifying that the actual inventory matches the documented inventory
Verifying that the log is completed with, at a minimum, the subject ID, name [CONTACT_39843], date and amount dispensed, date and amount returned, lot number for 
each dose, and that all containers used are documented accurately on the log.
Verifying that all required fields are completed accurately and legibly.
At the end of the study, each site will be provided with instructions as to the disposition of any 
unused investigational product. Drug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before 
being returned to the Coordinating Center. If Jazz Pharmaceuticals authorizes destruction at the 
study site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with 
applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided 
by [CONTACT_156239]. Prior to October [ADDRESS_259738] ensure that the materials 
are destroyed in compliance with any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_216080].
7.5.2 Formulation and Packaging: PF-04457845 (4mg) and matching placebo capsules will be 
provided by [CONTACT_156239] (prior to 2021 study medication was provided by 
[CONTACT_216079]). Weekly quantities of the capsules will be dispensed by [CONTACT_216081] (10 capsules per bottle). Study medication will be dispensed to 
the participants at the in-person treatment phase study visits (Week 1, Week 3, Week 5, and 
Week 7 Visits), during which they will be provided with enough study medication to last until 
their next in-person treatment phase study visit (2 weeks of study medication).   
7.5.[ADDRESS_259739] Storage and Stability: Each site’s research pharmacist will ensure that all 
investigational product is stored in a secured area under recommended storage conditions and 
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The PF-[ADDRESS_259740]

Assisted Remote Observation of Adherence (CAROMA): 
Adherence to study medication will be conﬁrmed using the 
CAROMA method as described elsewhere (203). Every morning 
5 days per week (Monday-Friday), research staff will video-call 
participants to visually observe them swallow the study 
medication using a standardized protocol ( Figure 15). Every 
morning, within a time period pre-determined by [INVESTIGATOR_73261], 
participants will be called on the cell phone and will be observed 
removing study medication from the packaging and swallowing 
the medication with water or juice. For privacy, participants will 
be first asked to ensure that nobody else is in the room. 
Participants will be asked to have water or juice handy. 
Participants will then be instructed to 1) hold the study capsule 
up to the camera, 2) show research staff that the medication is on their tongue, and 3) then hold 
the camera up to their mouth for a mouth check after swallowing. The research assistant will log 
visual confirmation of compliance. Participants will receive additional compensation for 
CAROMA visits, and for returning the smartphone when they complete the study, which is 
outlined in the economic considerations section below. If participants fail to complete the 
CAROMA visit, it will be assumed to be an event of nonadherence and payment will be forfeited. 
Please refer to Appendix H for detailed instructions on the CAROMA visit. 
Participants will be provided with a cellphone that has the hardware, software, and service 
necessary to transmit high quality video. Prior to randomization, each participant will receive 
training on how to use the cell phones and also trained on the CAROMA compliance protocol. 
For this, each participant will be placed in one clinic office with the phone. A research staff 
member will video call the participant from another location in the clinic and will observe the 
participant consuming one M&M candy (or similar) with a glass of water. All participants will 
need to have at least one successful training session prior to randomization. 
The CAROMA video calls will not be recorded. Immediately following each call, research 
staff will document visual confirmation of the participant taking his/her study medication, the 
time that the medication was taken. 
7.6.2 Plasma PF-04457845 Levels: Adherence will also be confirmed later by [CONTACT_216082]-

DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
8.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention: Discontinuation from PF-04457845 does not mean 
discontinuation from the study. Attempts will be made to complete the remaining study 
procedures as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]. If a clinically significant finding is identified 
(including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or 
qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new 
clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE). Every attempt should be 
made to collect the data that would be collected at a termination visit (Week 9 Visit) as listed in 
1.5 Schedule of Procedures: Table 2. If the participant is prematurely 
withdrawn from the treatment phase, he/she may be entered into the 4-week follow up phase.
8.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study: Participants are free to withdraw 
from participation in the study at any time upon request. The investigator may discontinue a 
participant’s study participation at any time during the study if the participant meets the study 
termination criteria. In addition, a participant may discontinue his or her participation without 
giving a reason at any time during the study. 
8.2.1 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Participant: The primary reason for 
discontinuation or withdrawal of the participant from the study or study drug should be recorded 
using the following categories. 
1)Adverse Event: The participant has experienced an AE that requires early termination 
because continued participation imposes an unacceptable risk to the participant’s 
health or the participant is unwilling to continue because of the AE.
2)Important Protocol Deviation: The discovery post-randomization that the participant 
failed to meet protocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and 
continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the participant’s health.
3)Lost to Follow-Up: The participant did not return to the study site and multiple attempts 
to contact [CONTACT_216084]. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_216085].
4)Voluntary Withdrawal: The participant wishes to withdraw from the study. The reason 
for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded. Please note: all attempts should be 
made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and where possible, the 
primary underlying reason should be recorded.
5)Pregnancy: The participant is found to be pregnant. Note: if the participant is found to 
be pregnant, the participant must be withdrawn immediately.
6)Nonadherence with Study Drug during Treatment Phase: based on the assessment of 
the investigator an out-of-adherence participant may be withdrawn from the study.
8.[ADDRESS_259741] to Follow-Up: A participant will be considered lost to follow up if he/she fails to 
complete 2 scheduled consecutive weekly visits or 10 consecutive days of missed study 
medication (~20% of nonadherence) during the treatment phase and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_216086]. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the

The following sections describe the study procedures to be performed and data to be collected. 
For each procedure, participants are to be assessed by [CONTACT_216090]. Please refer to 1.5 Schedule of Procedures:
Table 2 for a detailed schedule of study procedures. 
9.1 Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from the community with advertising (print, radio, 
television, online [Craigslist, Facebook, Instagram], and subway) or by [CONTACT_216091]. The 
advertisements ask “Is Marijuana or Cannabis a Problem for You? If so, you may qualify for a 
free and confidential research treatment study.” This study will also be registered on 
clinicaltrials.gov, an online listing of clinical trials that is available to the public, which also will 
serve as a recruitment source. The advertisements for this study are located in Appendix B.
Interested participants will be informed of the study and will first be screened on the phone 
to initially determine eligibility (see phone screen in Appendix C). If participants pass the initial 
screening for the study, they will then be invited for a full evaluation to assess eligibility based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information collected during the phone screen will only 
be used in the event that the participant continues to participate in the study. For those found 
ineligible, the information collected during the phone screen will be kept with the permission of 
the participant for the duration of the study to ensure that participants are not phone screened 
on multiple occasions. After determining initial eligibility, research staff will provide a brief 
description of the research and the participant will present to the clinic for the screening 
procedure.
9.2 Informed Consent Procedures: The consent process is a multistep process, whereby 
[CONTACT_216092]. 
Participants will be required to read the informed consent form and the investigator or her/his 
designee will additionally describe the risks and discomforts. The consent process may be 
completed remotely or in person. As part of the consenting process, one form of pi[INVESTIGATOR_215976]. Once all screening procedures have been collected, research staff as 
well as the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215977], based on the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, if the participant will continue with the remaining study 
procedures.
To ensure that the study participant understands the study, the participant will be asked 
questions about the study procedures and the risks associated with participation. Participants 
will be asked to pass a study questionnaire to document their understanding of the study. This 
consent questionnaire is located in Appendix D. If any concern arises that the study participant 
did not fully understand the study, the principal investigator (PI) or her/his designee may decide 
that the participant is not suitable for participation. If the participant is still interested after all 
questions have been answered, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215978]. 
Any participant who appears incapable of providing informed consent will be excluded. 
9.[ADDRESS_259742]/Informant: As a requirement for entry into this study, participants will need to 
identify an individual who is can serve as a contact [INVESTIGATOR_196977] a collateral source of information. Or 
two people could serve in these roles. A family member or a significant other/spouse is 
preferred. The participant will need to sign a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_215979]. The contact/informant could be contact[CONTACT_216093]. The contact/informant will also be contact[CONTACT_216094] 5/1/2022

the contact/informant may help corroborate information provided by [CONTACT_216095], as described elsewhere (204).
9.[ADDRESS_259743] ID Number Assignment: A unique subject ID number will be assigned to each 
participant at the time that informed consent is obtained/explained, and this is the subject id 
number that will be used throughout the study. Subject ID numbers will be maintained by [CONTACT_43898]. Each subject ID number will be composed of the ID for the site where the 
participant was screened and then sequential numbering. The subject ID’s for each site are as 
follows:
Columbia University: CU### (i.e. CU001, CU002, CU003…)
John Hopkins University: JH### (i.e. JH001, JH002, JH003...)
Medical University of South Carolina: SC### (i.e. SC001, SC002, SC003...)

Go program, created by [CONTACT_216098]. The rater will facilitate the completion of 
this program with the participant and will then review the results generated by [CONTACT_216099]. All participants who have access to a computer will be asked to complete the 
motivational interviewing during the virtual screening session. Research staff will remain on the 
video call with the participant throughout the completion of the motivational interviewing to 
answer any questions that the participant may have. When the participant attends the in person 
screening visit they will be given a hard copy of their motivational interviewing results to the 
participant to take home. In the event that a participant is unable to complete the motivational 
interviewing remotely (i.e. if they don’t have access to a computer), it may be completed during 
the in person screening session. 
9.5.4 Setting a Quit Date: During screening participants will counseled to attempt a quit date to 
fall sometime within the first week of treatment, at least two days after taking the study 
medication (Quit Week). The participants will be asked to sign a commitment to quit document

10.2.1 Laboratory Tests: The following safety laboratory tests will be performed at the following 
study visits: Screening, Week 1, Week, 5, Week 7, Week 9, and End of Study Visit (end of 
Week 12). They are conducted periodically throughout the duration of the study to monitor 
electrolyte and liver/kidney function. Additional laboratory results may be generated on the 
samples (without additional blood volume drawn) as a result of the method of analysis, the type 
of analyzers used, or as derived or calculated values; if such results are available, they may 
also be reported. Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to 
assess any perceived safety concerns.

If during the in-person visits a sample tests positive for any drug (other than THC) on site, a 
sample will be sent to the laboratory for confirmation. 
Participants may undergo random urine drug testing at the discretion of the investigator. Spot 
urine drug testing conducted prior to dosing must be positive for cannabinoids for participants to 
receive study medication.
On Site Urine and Serum Pregnancy Test: Urine HCG testing should first be performed using a 
urine pregnancy spot kit. If the result yields a positive result, then a serum HCG test will be sent 
out for confirmation. If the result yields a positive result during one of the remote study visits the 
participant will be asked to come in to the clinic to provide a blood sample and study medication 
will be suspended. For the serum HCG test, a blood serum sample will be collected using one 10 
cc Tiger-top Tube (tube does not contain an anticoagulant but does contain a clot activator and 
serum separator gel). 
Quantitative Urine Cannabinoids Toxicology: Urine samples will be collected at each of the in-
person visits as specified in the Schedule of Procedures ( 1.5 Schedule of Procedures:
Table 2). At each in-person visit, a urine sample will be obtained from the 
participant, pi[INVESTIGATOR_215986] 1.5 mL cryovial tube (urine sample should be filled up to the top 
line of the tube), and will be stored in a -[ADDRESS_259750]. Tom Cooper

metabolite of cannabis will be assayed by [CONTACT_216104] 
6 month batches using a GCMS method (205). Assays have intra- and inter-assay RSD% of 
10% at 1 ng/ml with 0.5 ng/ml as the lower limit of detection. Creatinine corrected THC-COOH 
levels will be reported.
10.2.2 Vital Signs: Blood pressure, pulse rate, oral temperature, height and body weight will be 
measured periodically and recorded, as specified in 1.5 Schedule of Procedures:

measured with the participant’s arm supported at the level of the heart, and recorded to the 
nearest mm Hg after at least [ADDRESS_259752]. The same arm (preferably the dominant arm) 
will be used throughout the study.
The same size blood pressure cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be 
used to measure blood pressure each time. The use of automated devices for measuring BP

the brachial/radial artery for at least [ADDRESS_259753]. BMI will be calculated for each participant through 
the Table listed in Appendix I.
10.2.3 Physical Examinations: Completed physical and neurological examinations will be 
conducted at screening and at the end of the treatment phase or early termination visit. 
Physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained physician assistant, or nurse 
practitioner, as designated by [CONTACT_16541]. 
10.2.4 Electrocardiogram (ECG): ECGs should be collected after the participant has rested 
quietly for at least [ADDRESS_259754] 12-lead ECG will be recorded. A qualified individual appointed by [CONTACT_216105]. If interpreted as abnormal, the 
local investigator will assess the findings as either abnormal clinically significant, or abnormal not

ECG traces recorded on thermal paper will be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_215987]. 
10.3 Pharmacokinetics:
10.3.1 PF-04457845 Levels: Blood will be sampled for PF-04457845 levels as specified in the 
Schedule of Procedures ( 1.5 Schedule of Procedures: Table 2). 
Given that adherence will be confirmed visually, the PF-04457845 levels will be assayed in only 
a random sampling of approximately 1/3 of participants from each site to confirm adherence, as 
specified by [CONTACT_5081]. Assays will be conducted by [CONTACT_216106] a proprietary assay with existing permission from 
SpringWorks and Jazz Pharmaceuticals. The serum sample to be analyzed for PF-04457845 
levels should be collected in one 4 cc lavender top tube (tube containing K2-EDTA). Blood 
samples should be collected as close to approximately 1 hour after the participant has taken 
their daily dose of study medication (PF-04457845/placebo). The time at which the blood 
sample has been drawn at should be documented, along with the time that the study medication 
was taken that day. The sample should then be centrifuged at approximately 1700g for about 10 
minutes at 4 degrees Celsius, pi[INVESTIGATOR_215988] 1.5 mL screw capped 
polypropylene tubes (1 mL of serum sample per tube; 2 polypropylene tubes), and then stored 
in a -80 degree Celsius freezer within 1 hour of collection. Samples will be stored on site until 
they are to be sent directly to WuXi by [CONTACT_25733], at the end of the study. 
Shipment of Pharmacokinetic Samples: Each site will store blood samples to be assayed for 
PF-[ADDRESS_259755] each individual site on 
which random sampling of participants should be shipped.
10.3.2 Plasma Anandamide Levels: Blood will be sampled for plasma anandamide and other

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 60 of 116endocannabinoid levels as specified in the Schedule of Procedures ( 1.5 Schedule of 
Procedures: Table 2). Plasma anandamide and other endocannabinoid (Oleoylethanolamine, Palmitoylethanolamine) levels will be assayed in a random sampling of approximately 1/3 of participants from each site to demonstrate target engagement of PF-04457845 levels. Assays will be conducted by [CONTACT_216107]. Measuring eCb evels will provide biological evidence that the FAAH Inhibitor blocking the enzyme that degrades eCb resulting in increased eBc levels: target engagement. This will provide further confirmation that treatment intervention is working and the provide a proxy measure of medication adherence. Endocannabinoid samples should be drawn in a 6cc Lavender-top Tube (tube contains EDTA as an anticoagulant). The sample should be immediately centrifuged at 2,000g for 10 minutes and should not sit on ice for any length of time because this can alter the endocannabinoid levels and lead to false results. The resulting plasma should be immediately aliquoted into a 1.5 mL screw capped polypropylene tube (at least 1 mL aliquoted into this tube), and then the tube should be immediately placed in a -80 degree Celsius freezer for storage. If possible, it is preferable to flash freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen before storing them at -70 degrees Celsius. 
Shipment of Plasma Anandamide Samples: Each site will store blood samples to be assayed for 
anandamide levels on site at -[ADDRESS_259756]. Makriyannis at Northeastern University, approximately every 6 months. 
10.3.3 DNA: A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding for FAAH - C385A 
variance was reported to be significantly associated with changes in withdrawal after 
abstinence, and happi[INVESTIGATOR_215989] (206-208). Recently, [ADDRESS_259757] time in a Yale-led study by [CONTACT_216108]., 216 (209). These 
included rs143244591 in novel antisense transcript RP11-206M11.7; rs146091982 in the solute 
carrier family 35 member G1 gene (SLC35G1); and rs77378271 in the CUB and Sushi multiple 
domains 1 gene (CSMD1). These and other genes will be studied in an exploratory manner to 
examine for genetic moderators of response to PF-04457845. DNA will be sent to the laboratory 
of [CONTACT_173097] at Yale.
One 10cc PAXgene Blood DNA tube (sterile vacutainer plastic tube with hemogard closure 
and K3 EDTA additive) should be collected for DNA analysis for all participants at the screening 
visit and appropriately labeled. Each sample should be frozen first at -20 degrees Celsius for 24 
hours, and then transferred to a -80 degree Celsius freezer, in the original 10cc tube that it was 
collected in. 
DNA will be extracted from whole blood samples using the salting out method implemented 
in the PaxGene (PreAnalytix Inc.) DNA extraction systems. DNA samples are aliquoted into 96 
PCR plates at a concentration of 10ng/μl. These working PCR plates are stored at -20ºC until 
their use for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Stock DNA samples are stored at -80ºC. The PCR reactions are 
prepared either manually or using the TECAN GENESIS pi[INVESTIGATOR_215990]. To minimize 
possibility for cross contamination, one TECAN robot is dedicated to pre-PCR and another to 
post-PCR use. PCR will be conducted using MJR PTC-200 (96 or 384 wells), MJR PTC-225 
Tetrad (4x384 wells) or ABI GeneAmp 9700 cyclers (384 wells). We will use the TaqMan 
method for SNP genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which is in routine use in this laboratory. In the TaqMan method, a 
primer is allowed to hybridize on top of the SNP site. In the presence of a mismatch between 
the primer and the variant base, the affinity of the primer to the template is less than in the case 
of a perfect match. PCR primers hybridized adjacent to the SNP site are then allowed to be 
elongated. In the presence of a mismatch, the hybridization primer is displaced. If the 
hybridization primer is not displaced, it emits fluorescence, which is detected by [CONTACT_216109]. SNP assays will be ordered from Applied Biosystems Inc.‚s (ABI) Assay-on-Demand 
collection or they will be custom designed and ordered from ABI‚s Assay-by-Design service. An 
ABI 7900 HT real time PCR machine, located at the Yale-VA Laboratory of Psychiatric 
Genetics, will be used to analyze TaqMan SNP assays. Variants of the cannabinoid receptor 
gene and other relevant genes will be studied.
Shipment of DNA Samples: Each site will store samples at -80 degrees Celsius. Samples will be 
sent in large batches (every 6 months) directly to the laboratory of [CONTACT_216177] at Yale 
University. 
10.4 Demographics, Medical History, and Medication History Procedure: At the screening 
visits, extensive demographic information will be collected including date of birth or age, sex, 
ethnicity, race as described by [CONTACT_2299], smoking status, reproductive status, alcohol 
consumption, and caffeine consumption of the participant. 
10.4.1 Documentation of Concomitant Medication: Concomitant medication is any drug given in

other than the study drug (used from signing of informed consent through the end of the study), 
and all medications including vitamin supplements, over-the-counter medications, and oral 
herbal preparations, must be recorded in the source documents. Permitted concomitant 
medications will be left to the direction of the site principal investigator. When in doubt the site 
investigator should contact [CONTACT_216110] [INVESTIGATOR_215991].
10.4.2 Documentation of Concurrent Medical Conditions: Concurrent medical conditions are 
those significant ongoing conditions or diseases that are present at signing of informed consent. 
This includes clinically significant laboratory, ECG, or physical examination abnormalities noted 
at screening, according the judgment of the investigator. The condition (i.e., diagnosis) should 
be described.
Participants with stable, chronic, nonemergent, well-controlled conditions may be permitted 
to participate at the discretion of the site investigator. Conditions that will be excluded: 1) 
serious or acute conditions e.g., appendicitis, 2) conditions that require frequent and significant 
medical interventions e.g., sickle cell crisis, 3) conditions that interfere with the primary outcome 
of interest e.g., alcohol or nicotine withdrawal, intoxication or dependence, etc. When in doubt 
the site investigator should contact [CONTACT_216111] [INVESTIGATOR_215992]. 
10.4.3 Documentation of Concurrent Psychiatric Conditions: Concurrent psychiatric conditions 
are those significant ongoing psychiatric conditions that are present at the signing of informed 
consent. Any concurrent psychiatric conditions should be well documented at screening. 
Participants with stable, chronic, nonemergent, well-controlled psychiatric conditions may be 
permitted to participate at the discretion of the site investigator e.g., anxiety disorder. Conditions 
that will be excluded: serious, acute conditions e.g., acutely suicidality, or conditions that require 
frequent and significant medical interventions e.g., bipolar disorders, conditions that interfere 
with the primary outcome of interest e.g., alcohol or nicotine withdrawal, intoxication or 
dependence, etc. When in doubt the site investigator should contact [CONTACT_216112] [INVESTIGATOR_215992].
Disallowed psychiatric problems include: a) Schizophrenia Spectrum and other Psychotic 
disorder in lifetime (current or past), b) Bipolar or related disorder in lifetime (current or past), 
and c) current Major Depressive Disorder.
10.5 Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5: to diagnose any significant psychiatric disorders 
(210). 
10.6 Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM): is a 
semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to deal with the problems of psychiatric diagnosis 
when participants drink heavily or use drugs. This interview will help differentiate between 
primary disorders, substance-induced disorders, and the effects of intoxication and withdrawal. 
For training and quality control purposes, the PRISM interviews will be audio recorded. The 
interviewees’ Subject ID number and the study visit week that the interview is being conducted 
at will be stated at the beginning of the recording. The participants name [CONTACT_216176]. Participants will be asked at screening if they are willing to consent to the audio 
recording being conducted. If the participant does not consent to this, the PRISM interview will 
still be conducted, but will not be audio recorded. The audio recordings will be transferred to [CONTACT_216178] at Columbia University for training and quality control purposes via each site’s IRB 
approved method of data transfer.

10.8 Scale for Assessment of Lifetime Cannabis Use (SALCU): this scale developed and 
being refined at our laboratory that examines estimates first use, heaviest use, lifetime use, 
frequency, amount, type and preferred method. Cannabis use is estimated with by [CONTACT_216113] $ 
value and weight with the help of a prop (see adjacent figure) that displays both joints of 
increasing sizes and the increasing amounts of oregano (as a proxy of cannabis) that have 
been carefully weighed. The prop ( Figure 16) helps participant more accurately estimate the 
amount of and frequency of cannabis used.
10.9 Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB): This approach will be used to estimate cannabis use (212) 
at baseline, and periodically throughout the study. 
Some TLFB data will be captured in face-to-face 
visits, while some will be captured during the 
CAROMA calls. Last [ADDRESS_259760] day 
use will be captured at different times. Frequency, 
quantity, and assigned-dollar value will be captured. 
The # of exposures within the defined time period i.e., 
week will be summed is the outcome of interest. Only 
for cannabis, a prop ( Figure 16) will be used to 
facilitate accurate estimation of amount used. The 
same approach will be used to assess alcohol and 
tobacco use.
10.[ADDRESS_259761]: A 
withdrawal discomfort score (summary score) will be 
computed by [CONTACT_10621] [ADDRESS_259762] (213) reported in previous studies will be 
used to track withdrawal symptoms. Each item of the marijuana withdrawal checklist is rated on 
a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe). 
10.11 Marijuana Craving Questionnaire-Short Form (MCQ-12): consists of 12 statements 
about the respondent’s feelings and thoughts about smoking cannabis as he/she is completing 
the questionnaire (i.e., right now) (214, 215). 
10.12 Marijuana Contemplation Ladder: Participants are asked to rate where they are 
re:changing their use of marijuana (216) with a score of 1 (“I enjoy using marijuana and have 
decided I’ll never change it. I have no interest in changing the way I use marijuana”) to a score 
of 10 (“I have changed my marijuana use and will never go back to the way I used marijuana 
before”).
10.13 Desire to Quit: Participants will be asked to rate their desire to quit using marijuana. 
Please rate how interested you are right now to quit or reduce your use of cannabis or 
cannabinoid products. Participants will be asked to respond to that question by [CONTACT_216114]: 0 = I’m not really interested; 1 = I’m somewhat interested; 2 = I’m 
seriously interested. 
10.14 Visual Analog Scale for Mood States: Participants will be asked to rate 12 feeling 
states including "anxious", "depressed", "irritable", "tired", "hungry", and "energetic" by [CONTACT_216115] 16: Prop to Estimate Cannabis Use

wrist actigraph [wgt3x-bt Monitor (Actigraphcorp®)] with technology that 
has been developed for sleep-wake assessment and allows access to raw 
accelerometer data ( Figure 17) (http://actigraphcorp.com/actigraph-wgt3x-
bt/). Wrist actigraphy has been validated and used successful in healthy, 
clinical, and substance-using populations (220-224). The wrist actigraph is 
a comfortable wristwatch-like device that measures arm accelerations 
and hence is a proxy for activity. Ambient light is also measured to assist 
in determining sleep onset/wake times. It is tamper-proof and water-
resistant, and will be worn ~24-hrs/day during the course of the study 
(removed only for swimming, bathing, and other fully submerged 
activities) on the participant’s non-dominant wrist. The wgt3x-bt is well-suited for a clinical trial, 
as it maintains [ADDRESS_259763] and 
store 180 total days of data before the need to upload. The use of the actigraph will begin during 
the baseline/lead-in period so that participants become accustomed to wearing it, using it as 
directed, and to collect baseline 
sleep/activity data. 24-Hour 
actigraphy will be used to assess 
sleep-wake, activity levels, and 
circadian phase during the lead-in 
and treatment phase, where it will 
be compared to self-reported data. 
The actigraphy outcome measures 
will include sleep latency, total 
sleep time, wake after sleep onset, 
sleep efficiency, and ambient light. 
Analysis of sleep-related 
actigraphy data will performed with 
ActiLife+Sleep feature package 
(Figure 18), which is ActiGraph's 
premier actigraphy data analysis 
software platform 
(http://actigraphcorp.com/actilife/). 
The software is fully customizable, 
and raw data can be exported for 
analysis via 3rd party software platforms if required.
Each participant will be fitted with the actigraph. The serial number of the watch will be 
recorded to be linked to the subject ID. At every study visit, data will be downloaded and the 
device will be charged before being returned to the participant.

screening to discriminate between 4 types of sleep disorders – sleep apnea, narcolepsy, 
psychiatric sleep disorders, and periodic limb movement disorder. This questionnaire will be 
used in establishing participant eligibility for participation. 
10.17.2 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_33548] (PSQI): This self-administered questionnaire queries 
normal sleep patterns and sleep problems (203). This will be given to participants at Screening, 
Week 1, Week 5, Week 9, and Week 12 ( 1.5 Schedule of Procedures:
Table 2). Higher scores indicate poor sleep and PSQI at screening will be analyzed as a 
covariate in the main outcome measures.
10.17.3 Clinician Administered Evening/Morning Sleep Questionnaire: Participant will be asked 
about the quality and quantity of their sleep, as well as how well-rested and alert they feel in the 
morning and at the end of the day (204). Instead of asking participants to fill out this 
questionnaire on their own, the same questions will be asked when participants are contact[CONTACT_216116]. In addition, participants note their sleep-wake 
schedule and timing of when medication was taken, as well as their daily intake of caffeinated 
beverages, nicotine, alcohol, and any other drugs or medications. The questionnaire will be 
given to participants at every clinic visit ( 1.5 Schedule of Procedures:
Table 2) to report on the night before and the morning of the visit. This questionnaire 
is the primary instrument for assessing subjective sleep quality, sleep-wake cycle outside of the 
sleep laboratory, and retrospective, subjective measurement of alertness. Subjectively reported 
sleep quality, alertness, and sleep schedule data from the Evening/Morning Sleep 
Questionnaire are secondary outcome measures in this study. 
10.18 Rater Qualification and Certification Process: To ensure collection of quality data from 
scales administered by [CONTACT_216117], raters assigned to this study will be required to fulfill qualification 
and/or training requirements. The process for qualifying and training raters will be described in 
manuals provided by [CONTACT_216118]. Furthermore, the study will include 
additional steps related to monitoring the quality of rater activity, which will be described in the 
manuals provided by [CONTACT_216119].
All raters will be required to successfully fulfill the full scope of rater training requirements for 
any scale they will be administering prior to rating any participants in this study. The sites will be 
responsible for ensuring that they have qualified raters who can conduct assessments in the 
study prior to enrollment of study participants.
Raters will be required to complete and submit experience details and curriculum vitae (if 
applicable) to the rater vendor in a timely manner. Once the rater’s experience level is reviewed 
and deemed adequate, then study-assigned raters will be approved to participate in the rater 
certification process.
11.0 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 65 of [ZIP_CODE].1 Known Potential Risks: The risks from this study include: 1) effects of PF-04457845, 2) 
cannabis withdrawal syndrome, 3)  blood drawing, and 4) behavioral and cognitive testing.
11.1.1 PF-04457845: The full investigator brochure contains detailed safety information about 
PF-0445784. Presented below is a synopsis of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of PF-04457845.
Animals Studies: PF-04457845 has potent and long lasting antinociceptive effects in rats with 
oral administration. At 1 mg/kg displays PF-04457845 in vivo efficacy for over 24 hours with 
concomitant FAAH inhibition, and elevation of brain and plasma anandamide, N-palmitoyl 
ethanolamine (PEA) and N-oleoyl ethanoamine (OEA). Furthermore, unlike direct CB1 R 
agonists even at high doses PF-[ADDRESS_259764] effects on motility, catalepsy, or body 
temperature, which are the classic central nervous system effects of CB1R agonists. 
Humans Phase 1 Studies: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase [ADDRESS_259765] 
been conducted in healthy male participants (n=64), aged 21 to 55 to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and tolerability of single and multiple oral 
doses of PF-04457845 in healthy participants. Dose regimens included single doses from 0.1 to 
40mg and multiple doses from 0.5 to 8mg once daily (QD) for 14 days. Blood and urine were 
collected for PK analysis. 
Pharmacokinetics: With single doses, absorption of PF-04457845 is rapid, and concentrations 
peak (Cmax) within an average of [ADDRESS_259766] dose. Elimination of PF-04457845 is multi-
phasic, with a half-life (t1/2) ranging from 12-[ADDRESS_259767] parent was 
negligible. PK is commensurate with QD dosing. Phase 1 safety: Several phase [ADDRESS_259768] 
been conducted. Safety assessments including adverse events  monitoring, physical 
examinations, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate and body  temperature) and 
laboratory safety tests were conducted at intervals throughout all studies. Continuous  cardiac 
monitoring, via telemetry was conducted up to [ADDRESS_259769] study. All observed or reported AEs were 
recorded for all participants  and AEs were classified as mild, moderate or severe and their 
relationship to study drug was assessed by [CONTACT_11168]. As illustrated (Figure 19) the drug 
and its effects persist for up to [ADDRESS_259770] dose; this is the  reason for the 4-week safety 
follow-up.
Pharmacodynamics: Peripheral FAAH activity was measured ex vivo in blood leukocytes. 
Plasma concentrations of anandamide, PEA, OEA and N-linoleoylethanolamide (LEA) were 
measured as pharmacodynamic biomarkers.  PEA, OEA and LEA have anti-inflammatory, sleep 
inducing and appetite inducing effects. Inhibition of FAAH activity and elevation of a number of 
fatty acids has been demonstrated with single and multiple doses. Pharmacological washout 
takes 10 days after multiple dosing with 4mg due to a combination of the time it takes for the 
drug to clear and the time that it takes for FAAH activity to recover. This slow pharmacological 
washout may offer the advantage of being less likely to result in withdrawal symptoms.

associated with changes in cognitive function in 
healthy adults  when given over 14 days 
(Figure 20). The cognitive effects of PF-
04457845 were investigated in study 
B0541002 by  [CONTACT_216120]. The study was a 
phase 1, double-blind (Coordinating Center

group, oral multiple-dose trial to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of  PF-[ADDRESS_259775] battery 
consisted of a series of  computerized tasks 
that assessed a range of  cognitive functions. 
Cognitive functions assessed  included 
psychomotor function, visual attention,  learning, 
executive function, and delayed recall,  as well as a global measure of cognition across  domains 
(i.e., composite). Each test  administration was completed in approximately  15 minutes. 
Participants were assessed 15 times  (including 2 practice sessions at screening). Across a wide 
dose range, including the dose proposed in this study, given over 14 days PF-04457845 was 
not associated with changes in cognitive function  in healthy adults when given over 14 days. 
Phase 2A (Osteoarthritis): [COMPANY_007] conducted a phase 2a randomized, double-blinded, double-
dummy, placebo-  and active-controlled, 2-way cross-over, flare-enriched multi-center clinical 
trial to examine the pain relief  produced by 2 weeks of daily oral administration of PF-04457845 
in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.  PF-04457845 was well tolerated in patients with OA, 
with a safety profile that was indistinguishable from  placebo. The study was conducted in 5 
centers in Canada, Sweden, and the [LOCATION_002] of America and  randomized 76 participants. 
During the study, no participant died or had a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). No participant was 
permanently withdrawn due to an Adverse Event (AE). A total of 136 AEs (all causalities) were 
reported in 51%, 58%, and 51% of participants treated with PF-04457845, naproxen, and 
placebo, respectively. There were  no clinically significant trends or clinically significant 
abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs  measurements, or ECG findings. Most AEs 
were mild in severity; 31 AEs were moderate, and 2 AEs  were severe (nightmare and headache 
in the placebo treatment group).

The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs across all treatment groups were 
headache,  fatigue, and constipation, none of which were judged by [CONTACT_216121]-04457845. The  only commonly reported treatment-emergent AE that was also judged 
related to PF-[ADDRESS_259779] common adverse events are presented in Table 14.  There were no 
serious adverse events, or adverse events that caused functional un-blinding and no  
cannabinoid-type events.
Phase 2A (Cannabis Use Disorder): Details of the study design are provided (earlier). Of 218 
DSM-IV cannabis dependent males screened, 70 participants were randomized ( Figure 5) and 
[ADDRESS_259780] met the target of 60 completers was terminated shortly after learning of the outcome 
of the phase I trial of BIA 10-2474 (see below).
 Clinical laboratory tests for safety completed at screening, during inpatient stay (Day 0, 
Day 4), at all weekly appointments during treatment, and during follow up phase (Week 8). 
Participants monitored by [CONTACT_216122] ~1 week long inpatient 
phase. Participants were evaluated by a study doctor at all outpatient visits. There were no 
serious adverse events associated with this trial. The rates of minor adverse events were no 
different between the 2 groups ( Table 8). The DSMB met every 6 months and had no concerns 
nor recommendations.
Premature discontinuation of the Proof of Concept (POC) Trial: On 1/18/2016, we halted our 
POC trial voluntarily after learning about the neurological SAEs that occurred during Biotrial’s 
FAAH Inhibitor study (BIA 10-2474) in [LOCATION_009]. At the time, there was very limited information 
available about the structure of the drug, its pharmacodynamics, or the doses that were being 
tested, and whether BIA 10-[ADDRESS_259781] had similar side effects. Similarly, other pharmaceutical 
companies that manufacture FAAH inhibitors such as [COMPANY_006], [COMPANY_012], [COMPANY_011], and 
Vernalis have not observed neurological side effects similar to BIA 10-2474 in any of their trials. 
In September 2016, the FDA completed their review of the events at Biotrial in [LOCATION_009] and 
removed the full clinical hold on FAAH inhibitors in the US. They released this statement before 
removing the hold:
“The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with information received from the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) and the French national medicines agency (ANSM), has completed a 
comprehensive review of safety information relevant to the investigational new drug BIA 10-
2474 and the potential implications for related drugs under investigation in the U.S. The Agency 
has found, based on the available information, that BIA 10-2474 exhibits a unique toxicity that

There are no clinical trials with BIA 10-[ADDRESS_259782] for FAAH inhibitors under investigation in the U.S. We 
are also working to ensure healthy participants, patients, and investigators participating in FAAH 
inhibitor clinical trials are fully informed of the risks and potential benefits of these experimental 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].”
Phase 2A (PTSD): Of the [ADDRESS_259783] day has two phases: 
habituation, during which the participants are familiarized with the testing apparatus and 
conditioned stimuli, and acquisition, in which the positive conditioned stimulus is paired with the 
unconditioned stimulus, an electric shock delivered by a Biopac 150. The second day has two 
phases: drug administration, in which PF-[ADDRESS_259784] day has one phase; extinction recall, in which participants will be assigned 
to extinction recall, which has different environmental cues. Single doses of PF-0445784 were 
well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events associated with this study.
11.1.2 Cannabis Withdrawal Symptoms: The typi[INVESTIGATOR_215993]:  
cannabis craving, anger, aggression, appetite change, weight loss, irritability, anxiety, 
restlessness, altered  sleep, strange dreams and physical discomfort (39, 40, 99, 225). Less 
common symptoms include: chills, depressed mood,  stomach pain and sweating. Most 
symptoms appear within 1 day of abstinence, peak within 2–3 days, and  resolve within 1–[ADDRESS_259785] four weeks (45 days and  28 
days, respectively). Both studies observed prominent withdrawal symptoms during the initial 
two to three  weeks of abstinence, some of which persisted through the entire study period (63, 
70). The findings of these  studies suggest that withdrawal symptoms may persist longer than [ADDRESS_259786] re-  administration. Finally, the administration of 
cannabis or THC attenuates withdrawal symptoms.
These symptoms that people experience when they stop smoking marijuana are uncomfortable 
but not life  threatening. The marijuana withdrawal symptoms will be monitored closely. If 
intolerable, participants will be  able to withdraw from further study participation. 
11.1.3 Phlebotomy: Bruising, infection and thrombosis can occur during phlebotomy. These 
risks can be  minimized by [CONTACT_216123].  Participants will have no more than 3 oz. of blood drawn over the 
entire study period. These amounts are well  within the Red Cross blood standards.
11.1.4 Behavioral/Cognitive Testing: Some participants may experience the behavioral as 
boring or frustrating. Trained research staff will work closely with participants and if necessary 
provide them  with breaks.
11.2 Known Potential Benefits: Study participation may facilitate a reduction of cannabis use 
for study participants. Group data collected from this study will also inform the development of

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 70 of 116this drug for the treatment of CUD, for which there are no currently approved pharmacological 
treatments.
11.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits: Cannabis is the most widely used illicit 
substance worldwide. In 2009, cannabis was the illicit drug with the  highest rate of past year 
dependence or abuse; there were more treatment admissions for cannabis in the US  than for 
any other drug including cocaine or heroin. There are no approved pharmacological treatments 
for CUD and as stated in the FOA: “the development of safe and effective medications to treat 
these disorders is an urgent  public health need.” Furthermore, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_215994] a collaboration with the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
In the completed phase 2A study, PF-04457845 reduced cannabis withdrawal, reduced self-
reported cannabis use, reduced urinary levels of THC-COOH and restored stage 3 sleep deficits 
in cannabis dependent individuals with an excellent tolerability and safety profile. For the 
proposed study, the potential risks to participants appear low. Furthermore, the study entails no 
financial  or social risk to the participant.
FAAH inhibitors are a new chemical entity. There are very few FAAH-inhibitors that are 
available for use in humans, and  none are available commercially. The proposed study has the 
potential to yield important knowledge towards continued development of this treatment 
approach for an unmet need. Therefore, the proposed study has a favorable risk/benefit profile.
11.4 Mitigation of Risk: 
11.4.1 Screening: For the proposed study, participants will be carefully screened to exclude 
participants with any significant medical or psychiatric problems.  The screening process is 
rigorous and includes a structured clinical interview for DSM, a psychiatric and  medical 
evaluation by a psychiatrist, laboratory tests, EKG, etc. An outside informant specified by [CONTACT_216124]. This process should screen out unsuitable  
participants. 
11.4.2 Effects of PF-04457845: Once enrolled into the study, participants will be seen weekly by 
a clinician. Furthermore, participants will also be contact[CONTACT_216125]: tolerability. The research assistant making the 
CAROMA call will pass along to the Investigator or her/his designee any tolerability or safety 
issues discovered on the CAROMA call. Laboratory testing will also be conducted during the 
study to detect any clinically significant changes. At study visits, formal assessment for AEs 
(discussed below) will also be done. These overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_215995].
11.4.3 Phlebotomy and IV Placement: Bruising, infection and thrombosis can occur when 
phlebotomy is performed. These risks are minimized by [CONTACT_216126]. Participants who have recently donated 
blood will need to wait for eight weeks before participating in the study. Sterile procedures will 
be followed to minimize the likelihood of infection.
11.4.4 Cannabis Withdrawal: Most symptoms appear within one day of abstinence, peak within 
two to three days, and resolve within one to two weeks. Research staff will be available to 
provide support and reduce anxiety. 
11.4.5 Resumption of cannabis use in cannabis dependent participants who achieve 
abstinence: At the end of the study, interested participants will be offered information to

administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a drug whether or not it is considered related to the drug. All observed or volunteered AEs 
regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) 
will be reported as described in the following sections.
The site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215996]. At a minimum of every six months (including when re-approval of the 
protocol is sought), each site should notify the Coordinating Center of all adverse events. The 
Coordinating Center will then conduct safety reviews across all sites participating in the study. 
During the review process, the study principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215997] (responsible for medical oversight) will evaluate whether the study should continue 
unchanged, require modification/amendment, continue or close to enrollment. Either the study 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_215998].
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to the Coordinating Center. For all AEs, sufficient information 
should be obtained by [CONTACT_4683]. The investigator is 
required to assess causality. Follow-up by [CONTACT_216127] a level acceptable to the investigator, and the Coordinating 
Center concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by [CONTACT_5081], any non-serious 
adverse event that is determined by [CONTACT_216128] a SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further 
information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the 
event in the context of the clinical trial.
12.1 Reporting Period: For SAEs, the active reporting period begins from the time that the 
participant provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the participant’s participation in 
the study, through the last follow up visit (end of study visit). Should an investigator be made 
aware of any SAE occurring any time after the active reporting period, it must be promptly 
reported.
12.2 Capturing Adverse Events: Safety and adverse events will be captured using the 
Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE) general and specific inquiry 
forms, which take approximately [ADDRESS_259788] safety follow up visit. At each study visit, the investigator will

been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked. Participants may report AEs occurring at any 
other time during the study. All participants experiencing AEs, whether considered associated 
with the use of the study drug or not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to Baseline or until there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the changes observed. All AEs will be documented, whether or not 
the investigator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. Any medical condition 
that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not 
reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during 
the study, it will be recorded as an AE.
The following information will be documented for each event:
1. Event term.
2. Start and stop date and time.
3. Pattern of AE (Frequency).
4. Intensity.
5. Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_215999](s) (related or not related).
6. Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_117497](s), including the 
details of the suspected procedure.
7. Action concerning study drug.
8. Outcome of event.
9. Seriousness.
The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299]. The event does not 
generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.
Moderate: An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. 
The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.
Severe: An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, significantly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention, and are usually potentially life-
threatening or incapacitating. The term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not 
necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly 
with participant’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
Action Concerning the Study Drug: For every adverse event, the action taken concerning the 
study drug will be documented on the source document. 
Drug withdrawn: a study drug is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed: the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study drug.
Unknown: only use if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable: study drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE (the 
study has been terminated, the participant died, dosing with study drug was already stopped 
before the onset of the AE)
Dose Interrupted: the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
12.3 Assigning Causality of Adverse Events: Causality to study procedures should be 
determined for all adverse events. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page [ADDRESS_259790].
Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention 
administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_113395]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be 
clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, 
with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.
Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence 
of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to 
be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically 
reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required 
to fulfill this definition.
Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). 
However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” 
soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be 
upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.
Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant treatments).
Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must 
be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements 
if applicable. An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists 
a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; 
generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. 
If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, 
then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined by [CONTACT_216129]’s causality assessment is “unknown but 
not related to investigational product”, this should be clearly documented on study records.
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable. Adverse events will be monitored for each participant participating in 
the study and attributed to the study procedures / design by [CONTACT_26848] 
(Deepak Cyril D’Souza) according to the following categories:
Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s). 
Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational

Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
12.4 Adverse Event Outcome: For every adverse event, the outcome must be documented in 
the source document as one of the following.
Recovered/resolved – participant returned to first assessment status with respect to the 
AE.
Recovering/resolving – the intensity is lowered by 1 or more stages; the diagnosis or 
signs/symptoms have almost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory value improved, but 
has not returned to the normal range or Baseline; the participant died from a cause other 
than the particular AE with the condition remaining “recovering/resolving”.
Not recovered/not resolved – there is no change in the diagnosis, signs, or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/symptoms, or laboratory value on the last day of the 
observed study period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital 
anomaly; the participant died from another cause with the particular AE state remaining 
“not recovered/not resolved”.
Resolved with sequelae – the participant recovered from an acute AE but was left with 
permanent/significant impairment (e.g., recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal – the AEs are considered as the cause of death.
Unknown – the course of the AE cannot be followed up due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216000]’s participation in the study.

every study participant. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_216001].
12.5 Pre-Existing Conditions: Pre-existing conditions, present at the time of signing informed 
consent, are considered to be concurrent medical conditions and should not be recorded as 
adverse events. All pre-existing conditions and their severity need to be documented at the time 
of the screening visit. If the participant experiences a worsening or complication of such a 
concurrent medical condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately 
as an adverse event. Investigators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the 
change in the condition. 
12.6 Worsening of Adverse Events: If the participant experiences a worsening or complication 
of an AE after the first administration of study drug or any change in study drug, the worsening or 
complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., “worsening of…”).
12.7 Serious Adverse Events: An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at 
any dose:
1. Results in death.
2. Is life threatening.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

above, or b) may expose the participant to danger, even though the event is not 
immediately life threatening or fatal or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216002] a serious 
adverse event. An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a 
Serious Adverse Event. Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet 
the criteria for an SAE. It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] 
“seriousness” when determining whether reporting to the HIC or HSC is necessary.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the 
participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important 
medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
12.8 Follow-up of Serious Adverse Events: If information not available at the time of the first 
report becomes available at a later date, the investigator should complete a follow-up SAE form 
or provide other written documentation and notify the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of 
receipt. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1672] (e.g., ECGs, laboratory tests, 
discharge summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested. All 
SAEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event. The timelines 
and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the initial report.
12.9 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements: If an SAE occurs, the Coordinating 
Center is to be notified within [ADDRESS_259791] 
reporting form (e.g. local institutional SAE form, CIOMS, MedWatch 3500a, or similar), 
regardless of the suspected causal relationship between the SAE and the study drug. In 
particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening, notification to must be made immediately, 
irrespective of the extent of available AE information. This timeframe also applies to additional 
new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports. In the rare event that the 
investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., if an 
outpatient study participant initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the 
event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
AE. The Coordinating Center will submit any SAE report to Jazz Pharmaceuticals via email 
([EMAIL_4219]) on behalf of the investigator within [ADDRESS_259792] be submitted as soon as possible to the Coordinating Center. 
12.10 Pregnancy Reporting Requirements: In the case of a pregnancy in a female participant 
or a female partner of a male participant, the site must notify the Coordinating Center within 24 
hours of awareness. The Coordinating Center will report to Jazz Pharmaceuticals via email

and sent to Jazz Pharmaceuticals via email ( [EMAIL_4220]) as additional 
details of the pregnancy become available, and at the time that the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome (including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination), details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, 
congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complications or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. An 
abnormal pregnancy outcome (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy, etc.) are considered SAEs and will be reported as such.
12.11 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs, and Regulatory Authorities: The 
Coordinating Center will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, investigators, and 
IRBs, as applicable. All SAEs will be reported to NIDA within [ADDRESS_259794] a copy 
of all expedited reports to his or her IRB in accordance with local regulations.
The primary responsibility for monitoring data and safety will lie with the principal 
investigator (Deepak Cyril D’Souza), along with the site investigators and the research team. 
Each local investigator will meet with the research team at least once per week to discuss the 
safety of the study. The study principal investigator (Deepak Cyril D’Souza) will conduct a 
review of all adverse events upon completion of every study participant. The principal

13.1 Definition of Unanticipated Problems: The Office for Human Research Protections 
(OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in 
general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;
Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and
Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.
13.2 Unanticipated Problem Reporting: The investigator will report unanticipated problems 
(UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center 
(DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include the following information:
Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB 
project number;
A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;
An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;
A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP.
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following 
timeline:
UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the 
DCC/study Coordinating Center within 48 hours of the investigator becoming aware of 
the event.
Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study Coordinating Center 
within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.
All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_8706]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), 
and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within 5 days of the IRB’s

All data obtained during the course of the study will be uploaded to an electronic database 
created by [CONTACT_216130] (YCAS). Baseline and demographic data will 
be summarized for all treatment groups, and summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_216131]. Treatment compliance measures and 
retention in treatment will be calculated by [CONTACT_216132]. The 
full analysis set will be based on the modified Intent-To-Treat (ITT) principle, consisting of all 
participants who receive at least one dose of randomized study medication, and have a baseline 
and at least one post-baseline measurement. The per-protocol population will include all 
participants in the full analysis set but without any major protocol violations. Analyses of the per-
protocol population will be considered secondary. The data will first be scanned for potential 
outliers. All outliers will be double-checked prior to analysis and as necessary, sensitivity 
analyses without outliers will be performed. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, 
range, frequency) will be computed for each variable first and presented in tabular form. 
Continuous variables will be checked for normality using normal probability plots and 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. In case of non-normal distribution, transformations will be applied or 
non-parametric tests (226) will be used as necessary. A significance cutoff of 0.[ADDRESS_259795] sizes and associated 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated for the primary and all secondary outcomes in order to inform the design of future 
studies. All analyses will be performed in the latest version of SAS software. 
14.1 Sample Size Determination: Since there are no published studies on the effect of FAAH 
inhibitors on cannabis use reduction in humans, we estimated the expected size of the effect of 
PF-04457845 on cannabis use based on a subsample of participants from the completed Phase 
2A study. In the phase 2A study we forced everyone into abstinence by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_216004]. The proposed study design is different: participants are neither hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216005], which is more ecologically valid and consistent with most treatments for 
CUD being outpatient. Therefore, to estimate the expected size of the effect of PF-[ADDRESS_259796] week after being hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216006] >1 joint/day. Analyses revealed that the 
effect size of the difference in cannabis use by [CONTACT_216133]-small (d=0.42). 
To detect such an effect size with 80% power, we require a sample size of 178 participants 
assuming two-sided alpha = 0.05. Based on the completed study, and the experience of the 3 
other sites a ~25% dropout rate is expected and therefore, 237 participants will need to be 
studied to obtain complete data in 178 participants. 
14.2 Efficacy Analysis: 
14.2.1 Primary Outcome: To test the efficacy of PF-04457845 treatment on cannabis use the 
group (placebo vs. active) differences in change from baseline use in the average number of 
times per day of self-reported consumption of cannabis or a cannabis containing product will be 
tested using ANCOVA with treatment group as the main predictor of interest  and stratification 
variables (site [4 sites] and degree of cannabis exposure [medium and high] = 8 strata) as 
additional factors in the model. Multiple imputation of outcome data will be performed using 
PROC MI in SAS using regression imputation with baseline average number of times per day, 
treatment and baseline participant-level characteristics (age, sex, cannabis use, tobacco use, 
alcohol use) as predictors in the imputation model. Significantly higher change from baseline in 
the active group compared to the placebo group at 0.05 significance level will be considered

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page [ADDRESS_259797] square mean 
estimates with 95% confidence limits for change from baseline by [CONTACT_1570]. We will also 
present estimates of treatment effects by [CONTACT_216134] (high 
user or medium user) and evaluate whether treatment effects vary significantly by [CONTACT_216135] (this assessment will be secondary to the primary evaluation of average treatment effects 
across strata). Other secondary and sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome include: (1) 
mixed model analysis with average number of times per day of self-reported consumption of 
cannabis or a cannabis containing product as the outcome, treatment group (active vs. 
placebo), site (4 levels), degree of cannabis exposure (medium, high) as between-participant 
factors, and time (baseline, first four weeks of the treatment period, last four weeks of the 
treatment period) as a within-participant factor; (2) tippi[INVESTIGATOR_216007]; (3) analyses of the per-protocol sample. In the 
mixed model analysis all available data on individuals will be used and the best fitting variance-
covariance structure (among compound symmetry, compound symmetry heterogeneous, 
autoregressive of first order (AR(1)), autoregressive heterogeneous (ARH(1)), and unstructured) 
will be selected using Schwarz’s Bayesian Criterion (BIC). Post-hoc analyses will provide 
information about treatment effect across the different time points, and the potential influence of 
the data collection site and baseline degree of cannabis exposure on the outcome trajectories. 
Additional exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess the effect of gender, desire to quit, 
lifetime cannabis use, tobacco use, alcohol use, and other drug use on the outcomes by 
[CONTACT_216136]. Mixed models use all available data and are unaffected by [CONTACT_216137]. Sensitivity analyses under missing not at random assumptions will also be 
performed. 
14.2.2 Secondary Outcomes: The same analytic strategy will be followed for secondary 
outcomes compared to the primary outcome. Primary analyses will be based on ANCOVA with 
multiple imputation on the modified intent-to-treat sample, secondary analyses will include 
mixed models, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_216008]. The emphasis 
will be on effect estimation. Testing in the primary analyses will be adjusted using the 
Bonferroni-Holm method. For each eCB, plasma levels will be assessed by [CONTACT_6486] a mixed 
effects model with treatment, time, site, and the interaction terms as fixed effects, and tobacco 
use as covariate. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess the effect of variables such 
as gender and use of other substances on endocannabinoids. Since we expect floor effects for 
the blood levels of PF-04457845 in the placebo condition, PF-04457845 blood level will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_216138]-parametric models (226, 227) with treatment, time, site, and the 
interaction terms as factors. 
14.3 Safety Analysis: The review and summary of safety will be performed on the modified 
intent-to-treat sample. Events or abnormalities will be searched from the time of the first dose 
until [ADDRESS_259798] 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum, and summarized qualitatively by [CONTACT_216139]. Vital signs, BMI, weight will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Group 
differences in the percentage of participants who report AEs or exhibit clinically significant 
changes during 1) 8-week treatment phase (from the first dose until the last dose), and 2) the 4-
week follow up phase (to assess any lingering post treatment safety issues) will be summarized 
in tabular form and presented. Data permitting, exploratory analyses may be performed to 
evaluate the statistical significance of between-group differences (e.g. using Fisher’s exact tests 
for adverse events, t-tests or non-parametric equivalent for changes in continuous measures) 
and evaluation of the effects of duration of drug exposure or drug dose on any adverse events 
(e.g. using exact logistic regression) and laboratory measures (e.g. using mixed effects models).

15.1 Case Report Forms: As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer 
to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this study.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included participant. The completed 
original CRFs should not be made available in any form to third parties, without written 
permission from the Coordinating Center. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the 
collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any 
other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / 
original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and 
available when required. The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_216140]. Any corrections to entries made in 
the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should 
not obscure the original entry.
In most cases the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54602]'s chart. In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also 
serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the 
investigator’s site and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which 
the CRF will stand as the source document.
The Coordinating Center will supply study sites with access to CRFs. The Coordinating 
Center will make arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the CRF. These forms 
are used to transmit the information collected in the performance of this study to the 
Coordinating Center and regulatory authorities. CRFs must be completed in English.
15.2 Data Entry: Each site will be responsible for entering data into the electronic data base. 
After completion of the data entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, 
such as inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be issued by 
[CONTACT_216141].
Corrections will be recorded in an audit trail that captures the old information, the new 
information, identification of the person making the correction, the date the correction was 
made, and the reason for change. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_216009]. Furthermore, the investigator must retain full 
responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all data entered on the CRFs.
After all data for a participant has been entered electronically, the data will be locked. Any 
change of, modification of, or addition to the data on the CRFs should be made by [CONTACT_216142]. The principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_45288], and must e-sign and date the 
electronic eCRFs.
15.[ADDRESS_259799] Retention: The investigator will have to agree to keep all study-specific 
documents, the identification log of all participating participants, medical records, temporary 
media such as thermal sensitive paper, source worksheets, all original signed and dated 
informed consent forms, participant authorization forms regarding the use of personal health 
information (if separate from the informed consent forms), copi[INVESTIGATOR_216010]/electronic copy of eCRFs, including the audit trail, and detailed records of drug 
disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities or from the Coordinating 
Center or designees. Any source documentation printed on degradable thermal sensitive paper 
should be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_63159]’s chart to ensure 
long-term legibility.
All study records should be retained by [CONTACT_216143], or

15.4 Genetic Samples: Results of genetic tests will not be available to the participant, nor will 
we add them to medical records. (If a participant wants to know their risk for genetic diseases, 
we will refer them to a genetic counselor.) Additionally, the biological materials collected will be 
identified by [CONTACT_216144]. These procedures 
should prevent any confidential information from becoming known to anyone other than the 
scientists and research staff involved in this study. We believe that the chance of this 
information becoming known to others in such a way that it would be harmful to study 
participants is small.
All samples will be identified by a code number and will never been coded with any PHI. 
Once samples have been sent to be analyzed, the individuals working at the laboratory will not 
have access to the link between the names and the code numbers. This link between the 
names and code numbers will be held by [CONTACT_216145]. 
In the event that the materials collected for this project are shared or distributed for future 
research, they will first be stripped of any identifying information before distribution. Any material 
will only be shared in the event that another investigator provides a written request for the 
materials. In this request, the inquiring investigator must provide a hypothesis and specific aims 
that are deemed as appropriate by [CONTACT_216146]. Furthermore, the inquiring investigator must 
ensure this investigator that the same protections will be afforded to the genetic information and 
that the requesting investigator adhere to appropriate confidentiality guidelines. It is only then 
that materials will be shared or distributed.
15.5 Publication and Data Sharing: This study will be conducted in accordance with the 
following publication and data sharing policies and regulations: 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public has 
access to the published results of NIH funded research. It requires scientists to submit final 
peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed 
Central upon acceptance for publication. 
This study will comply with the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Policy on the Dissemination of 
NIH-Funded Clinical Trial Information and the Clinical Trials Registration and Results 
Information Submission rule. As such, this trial will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, and 
results information from this trial will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov. In addition, every 
attempt will be made to publish results in peer-reviewed journals. Data from this study may be 
requested from other researchers 3 years after the completion of the primary endpoint by 
[CONTACT_216147].

16.1 Study Site Monitoring Visits: Monitoring visits to the study site will be conducted 
periodically during the study by [CONTACT_30313] (YCCI) or similar 
organization to ensure that all aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be 
reviewed for verification of data recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as 
original documents, data, and records. The investigator and the study site guarantee access to 
source documents by [CONTACT_216148].
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_216149] (as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s 
Binder, study drug, participant medical records, informed consent documentation, 
documentation of participant authorization to use personal health information (if separate from 
the informed consent forms), and eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that 
the investigator and other study personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that 
sufficient time is devoted to the process.
16.2 Data Monitoring: A data monitoring plan will be developed to assess the data in an 
ongoing manner over the course of the study to ensure validity and integrity of key study 
endpoint data.
16.3 Protocol Deviations: Should it become necessary to deviate from the protocol in order to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants or some other unexpected circumstances 
arises, the investigator should consult with the Coordinating Center or designee and if 
necessary the IRB to determine the appropriate course of action. 
The site should document all protocol deviations in the participant’s source documents. In the 
event of an important protocol deviation, the site should notify the Coordinating Center or 
designee (and IRB as required). Important deviations include, but are not limited to, those that 
involve fraud or misconduct, increase the health risk to the participant, or confound 
interpretation of primary study assessment. Important protocol deviations will be reviewed at 
regular intervals by [CONTACT_216150].
16.4 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections: The study site also 
may be participant to quality assurance audits by [CONTACT_216151]. In this 
circumstance, the Coordinating Center -designated auditor e.g., YCCI will contact [CONTACT_216152]. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory 
samples are collected, where study drug is stored and prepared, and any other facility used 
during the study. In addition, there is the possibility that this study may be inspected by 
[CONTACT_17513], including: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institute of 
Drug Abuse (NIDA). If the study site is contact[CONTACT_63224] a regulatory body, the 
Coordinating Center should be notified immediately.
16.5 Data Monitoring Committee: This study does not include endpoints related to assessing 
mortality or major adverse health outcomes, and the study population is not at expected risk of 
serious safety events. The NIDA data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) that is independent 
of the study and project teams will periodically review unblinded safety data during conduct of 
the study to complement the routine safety monitoring approach for drugs at this stage of 
development. The NIDA DSMB will meet at least semiannually, but may meet more frequently if 
deemed necessary, to assess safety and efficacy data. The NIDA DSMB will provide its input to 
the Coordinating Center. A report of the NIDA DSMB meetings will be prepared and circulated 
to the IRBs and NIDA.

This study will be conducted in accordance with the International Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Participants (Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki 
(World Medical Association 2008). Each investigator will conduct the study according to 
applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her conduct in accordance 
with the “Responsibilities of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix J. 
17.1 IRB Approval: It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the 
study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant 
documents, e.g., recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB. All correspondence 
with the IRB should be retained in the Investigator File. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_216011]. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be 
initiated prior to IRB approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazards to the participants. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB and the 
Coordinating Center in writing immediately after the implementation.
The Coordinating Center or designee will require documentation noting all names and 
titles of members who make up the respective IRB. If any member of the IRB has direct 
participation in this study, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting must 
also be obtained. This protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, a copy of the informed consent 
form, and, if applicable, participant recruitment materials and/or advertisements and other 
documents required by [CONTACT_1763], must be submitted to the local IRB 
for approval. The IRB’s written approval of the protocol and participant informed consent must 
be obtained and submitted to the Coordinating Center or designee before commencement of 
the study. The IRB approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_1764], number, and version 
date; identify versions of other documents (e.g., informed consent form) reviewed; and state the 
approval date. The Coordinating Center or designee will ship drug/notify site once the 
Coordinating Center or designee has confirmed the adequacy of site regulatory documentation.
Study sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by [CONTACT_63217]. This may 
include notification to the IRB regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed consent 
form, recruitment materials intended for viewing by [CONTACT_4317], local safety reporting 
requirements, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study at intervals 
specified by [CONTACT_35974], and submission of the investigator’s final status report to IRB. 
All IRB approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be provided to the 
Coordinating Center or designee.
17.2 Participant Information, Informed Consent, and Participant Authorization: All parties 
will ensure protection of participant personal data and will not include participant names on any 
Coordinating Center forms, reports, publications, or in any other disclosures, except where 
required by [CONTACT_28769]. Participant names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be 
replaced by a numerical code consisting of a numbering system provided by [CONTACT_216155]-identify trial participants. In case of data transfer, the Coordinating Center 
will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of participant personal data. 
The Coordinating Center will provide the protocol and consent form that sites can use to 
submit to their IRB. Any substantive changes made to the consent form or protocol provided 
by [CONTACT_216156]. The 
investigator or her/his designee must ensure that each study participant, or his/her legal 
representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks 
associated with participation. The investigator, or her/his designee, will obtain written informed 
consent from each participant before any study-specific activity is performed. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_216012] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 85 of 116signed informed consent form, the signed participant authorization form (if applicable), and 
participant information sheet (if applicable) shall be given to the participant. The site 
investigator will retain the original of each participant’s signed consent document.
All revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_216157]’s legally acceptable representative in the same manner as the original 
informed consent. The date the revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the 
participant’s medical record, and the participant should receive a copy of the revised informed 
consent form.
Participants who consented and provided a PGx sample for DNA and RNA analysis can 
withdraw their consent and request disposal of a stored sample at any time prior to analysis. 
The Coordinating Center is to be notified when consent has been withdrawn.
17.3 Participant Confidentiality: The Coordinating Center and designees affirm and uphold 
the principle of the participant’s right to protection against invasion of privacy. Throughout this 
study, a participant’s source data will only be linked to the Coordinating Center’s clinical trial 
database or documentation via a subject ID number. As permitted by [CONTACT_216158], limited participant attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth, and participant 
initials may be used to verify the participant and accuracy of the participant’s unique ID number.
To comply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify compliance with this protocol, the 
Coordinating Center requires the investigator to permit the monitor or the Coordinating Center’s 
designee, representatives from any regulatory authority (e.g., FDA, Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency), the Coordinating 
Center’s designated auditors, and the appropriate IRBs to review the participant’s original 
medical records (source data or documents), including, but not limited to, laboratory test result 
reports, ECG reports, admission and discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119252] a participant’s study participation, and autopsy reports. Access to a participant’s original 
medical records requires the specific authorization of the participant as part of the informed 
consent process. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_216013] (ie, participant name, address, 
and other identifier fields not collected on the participant’s eCRF).
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality in this study. All participant information will be kept 
confidential and only members of the investigative team with appropriate IRB/HIC and HIPAA 
training will have access to the study data. Data will be maintained and secured in locked file 
cabinets or password protected electronic media. A numbering code will be used to assign a 
unique identifier to each participant. 
For the Cellphone Assisted Remote Observation of Medication Adherence (CAROMA) 
procedures, participants will be called and observed taking study medications. The CAROMA 
procedure is not recorded, broadcast, nor will the likeness of the participants be used for 
anything other than what has been specified. The potential for loss of confidentiality is if 
someone taps the phone while a call is being made, but this risk is no different from someone 
tappi[INVESTIGATOR_28059] a phone (audio) conversation between the participant and the research team. The 
phones used for this practice will be encrypted by [CONTACT_21127]’ Information Technology Service so that 
loss of confidentiality is minimized. CAROMA was set up with input from Yale ITS in order to 
conform to Yale’s policies.
17.4 Publication and Disclosure: The investigator is obliged to provide the Coordinating 
Center with complete test results and all data derived by [CONTACT_87853]. During 
and after the study, only the Coordinating Center may make study information available to other 
study investigators or to regulatory agencies, except as required by [CONTACT_6617]. Except as 
otherwise allowable in the study site agreement, any public disclosure (including publicly 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/1/2022Page 86 of 116accessible websites) related to the protocol or study results, other than study recruitment 
materials and/or advertisements, is the sole responsibility of the Coordinating Center. The 
Coordinating Center may publish any data and information from the study (including data and 
information generated by [CONTACT_093]) without the consent of the investigator. Manuscript 
authorship for any peer-reviewed publication will appropriately reflect contributions to the 
production and review of the document. All publications and presentations must be prepared in 
accordance with this section and the study site agreement. In the event of any discrepancy 
between the protocol and the study site agreement, the study site agreement will prevail. The 
investigator needs to obtain a prior written approval from the Coordinating Center to publish any 
information from the study externally such as to a professional association.
17.5 Clinical Trials Registration: In order to ensure that information on clinical trials reaches 
the public in a timely manner and to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and guidance, the 
Coordinating Center (Yale University) will register this study on clinicaltrials.gov and will 
maintain the record at a minimum of every [ADDRESS_259800].
17.6 Future Use of Stored Specimens and Data: Data collected for this study will be analyzed 
and stored at the Coordinating Center. After the study is completed, the de-identified, archived 
data will be transmitted to and stored at the FAAH-Inhibitor Phase 2A Study Data Repository, 
for use by [CONTACT_21227]. Permission to transmit data to 
the FAAH-Inhibitor Phase 2A Study Data will be included in the informed consent. 
With the participant’s approval and as approved by [CONTACT_141238] (IRBs), 
de-identified biological samples will be stored at the FAAH-Inhibitor Phase 2A Study Biosample 
Repository with the same goal as the sharing of data with the FAAH-Inhibitor Phase 2A Study 
Data Repository. These samples could be used to research the causes of cannabis use 
disorder and related conditions, its complications and other conditions for which individuals with 
cannabis use disorder are at increased risk, and to improve treatment. The FAAH-Inhibitor 
Phase 2A Study Biosample Repository will also be provided with a code-link that will allow 
linking the biological specimens with the phenotypic data from each participant, maintaining the 
blinding of the identity of the participant. 
During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to 
have biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with 
regard to biosample storage may not be possible after the study is completed. 
When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the 
FAAH-Inhibitor Phase 2A Study Data Repository.

(CAROMA) INSTRUCTIONS
Cellphone Assisted Remote Observation of Medication Adherence (CAROMA) refers to the 
system of visually confirming daily medication compliance for the purposes of a clinical trial 
using cellphones. Participants in this trial are provided with a cellphone with video capabilities 
(iPhone) and video calling software (Skype) necessary to transmit high quality video. Video 
calling is conducted using the Skype application over a cellular network, without relying on 
whether the participant has internet access. Participants are instructed to not use the phone for 
personal reasons. 
At the baseline visit, the research team trains participants on how to use the phone prior to the 
initiation of study medication. Several practice runs are conducted with the participant during the 
in person visit, where participants are observed taking M&Ms using Skype. Upon showing 
sufficient understanding of the phone itself and the CAROMA protocol, participants are given a 
phone to bring home during the duration of the treatment phase of the trial. For the duration of 
the treatment phase, participants are contact[CONTACT_198647], Monday through Friday, at a pre-
determined time for observation of medication dosing. Each CAROMA call proceeds as follows: 
1) Greet the participant and ask them how they are doing.
2) Ask the participant if they have their study medication and water (or preferred beverage).
3) Instruct the participant to put the medication in their hand and display this to research 
staff.
4) Instruct the participant to open their mouth and put the study medication on their tongue 
so that research staff could verify that the medication has been placed in the 
participant’s mouth. 
5) Ask the participant to swallow the medication and take a few sips of their drink. 
6) The participant should then open their mouth and move their tongue from side to side so 
that the research staff could verify the medication has been swallowed.
7) Thank the participant for their time and remind them of the following day’s CAROMA visit 
or of their next study visit, as appropriate. 
Please Note: 
Successful CAROMA check-in’s last under [ADDRESS_259812] via Skype, and then a 
phone call to the participant’s personal cell phone (or preferred method of contact). 
CAROMA calls are not for AE assessment. However, if a participant is to report an AE it 
should be captured and reported to the site principal investigator.
The following information should be documented for each CAROMA call:

of these obligations.
5. Secure prior approval of the study and any changes by [CONTACT_216174] 21 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 56, ICH, and local regulatory requirements.
6. Ensure that the IRB will be responsible for initial review, continuing review, and approval of 
the protocol. Promptly report to the IRB all changes in research activity and all anticipated 
risks to participants. Make at least yearly reports on the progress of the study to the IRB, 
and issue a final report within 3 months of study completion.
7. Ensure that requirements for informed consent, as outlined in 21 CFR Part 50, ICH and local 
regulations, are met.
8. Obtain valid informed consent from each participant who participates in the study, and 
document the date of consent in the participant’s medical chart. Valid informed consent is 
the most current version approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Each informed consent form should contain a 
participant authorization section that describes the uses and disclosures of a participant’s 
personal information (including personal health information) that will take place in connection 
with the study. If an informed consent form does not include such a participant authorization, 
then the investigator must obtain a separate participant authorization form from each 
participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative.
9. Maintain current records of the receipt, administration, and disposition of SpringWorks/Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals-supplied drugs, and return all unused PF-04457845/placebo to Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals at the end of the study.
10. Report adverse reactions to the Coordinating Center (Yale University) every 6 months. In 
the event of an SAE, notify the Coordinating Center within 24 hours.
11. If the investigator/institution retains the services of any individual or party to perform trial-
related duties and functions, the investigator/institution should ensure that this individual or 
party is qualified to perform those trial-related duties and functions and should implement 
procedures to ensure the integrity of the trial-related duties and functions performed and any 
data generated.

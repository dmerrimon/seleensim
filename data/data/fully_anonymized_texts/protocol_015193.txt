Date:  [ADDRESS_862679] using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched 
donor or 9/10 HLA-matched donor (related or unrelated)  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  Purified regulatory T- cells (T
reg) plus CD34+ hematopoietic 
progenitor cells (“CD34+ HSPC”)   
PRIMARY OBJECT IVE 1. To determine the efficacy, safety and feasibility of administration of several dose combinations of conventional T- cells (T
con) and 
regulatory T- cells (T reg) in subject s undergoing allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) with HLA- matched 
donor or 9/10 HLA- matched donors (related or unrelated) using a 
T-cell depleted graft [CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells 
(“CD34+ HSPC”)], without immune -suppression.  
2. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of infused 
regulatory and conventional T- cells in the matched donor setting 
3. Determine if concomitant single -agent immunosuppression is 
needed with fresh T reg cells (phase 2 stage 1) 
4. To determine 1- year GvHD- free relapse -free survival  (GRFS)  
post- HCT  (phase 2 stage 2) 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  1. To determine the [ADDRESS_862680] disease ( GvHD ) 
3. To measure incidence of serious infections  
HYPOTHESIS  For subject s with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic 
myeloablative (MA) HCT with a T- cell depleted graft, the infusion of 
naturally occurring regulatory T- cells  with conventional T- cells 
(T-cell addback) in pre-defined doses and ratios will reduce the 
incidence of acute GvHD while augmenting the graft vs leukemia 
effect and improving immune reconstitution.

IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 4 of 58 04 Feb  20 22 SAMPLE SIZE  Up to 88 subjects, consisting of: 
Phase 1 trial:  3 subjects per dose pair of regulatory T- cells and 
conventional T- cells (3 dose pairs to be studied).  Total of 
13 subjects.  
Phase 2 trial:  adaptive Simon 2-stage design. 
Initial stage cohort:  24  subjects  
Second stage cohort:  up to 51 subjects  
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  This is a phase 1-2 dose finding trial, with 2 degrees of freedom in the definition of dose (numbers of T
reg and T con, or, equivalently, the 
number of T con and the ratio of T reg to T con).  The study will 
nevertheless follow a traditional 3+3 model, as described in the diagram, to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of T
con at the 
minimum necessary ratio of T reg to T con. 
The Phase [ADDRESS_862682] of a n admissible Simon 
2-stage design  (Simon, 1989). 
The 1st phase is designed to evaluate the need for 
immunosuppression (IS)  by [CONTACT_644559] + graft -engineered product 
to graft -engineered product alone.  In the first stage, the trial 
investigates if the rate of GVHD is non -inferior for the 
graft -engineered product with and without IS.  Define θ  to be the 
differen ce in GVHD rates between the two arms:  (1) – (2), so that 
large θ  is promising for the graft-engineered product (2).  To test for 
non-inferiority, we want to test H 0:θ = -ϐ vs H α:θ = 0, where ϐ  is a 
specified margin of non-inferiority.  With [ADDRESS_862683] s this 
method has 80% power to test for a ϐ  = 10% margin of 
non-inferiority at α  = 0.5 (assuming a variance of 0.35).  
The 2nd phase will either use IS  + graft -engineered product or 
graft -engineered p roduct alone based on the first stage and evaluate 
1-year GRFS as the primary endpoint. The  null hypothesis  that the 
true 1-year GRFS  is 40% will be tested  against  a one-sided  
alternative.  The probability  of early  termination under  the null 
hypothesis  is 64%.  In the first stage,  17 patients  will be 
accrued.  If there  are 7 or fewer  successes in these 17 patients,  
the study  will be stopped.  Otherwise,  24 additional  patients  will 
be accrued for a total of 41. The null hypothesis  will be rejected 
if 22 or more  responses  are observed  in 41 patients.  This 
design  yields  a type I error rate of 5% and power  of 80% when  
the true 1-year GRFS  is 60%.

Primary Objectives   
1. To determine the efficacy, safety , and feasibility of administration of several dose 
combinations of conventional T- cells (Tcon) and regulatory T-cells (T reg) in subject s 
undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)  with HLA- matched 
donor or 9/10 HLA -matched donor (related or unrelated) , using a T-cell depleted 
graft [CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (“CD34+ HSPC”)], without 
immunosuppression (see Section  3.1 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_644518]- specified definition of matched  donor). 
2. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of infused T reg and T con cells with 
myeloablative allogeneic HCT using matching donors 
3. Determine if concomitant single -agent immunosuppression is needed with fresh 
Treg cells (phase  2 stage 1) 
4. To determine 1 -year GvHD- free relapse- free survival  (GRFS) post -HCT (phase 2 
stage 2). 
Secondary Objectives   
1. To determine the [ADDRESS_862686] cell types 
obtained from the apheresis harvests.  The cellular infusions may be referred to herein as 
treatment  components.  The treatment components used in Study  IRB-[ZIP_CODE] / BMT236 
are described as:  
• Conventional, unmanipulated, CD3+ T-cells (“T con cells” or “T con”).  These cells an 
unmanipulated aliquot of the apheresis harvests ; are used in regular medical care ; and 
Confidential  
IRB-[ADDRESS_862687] on Study Day  2. 
• Purified CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (“CD34+ HSPC”).  The CD34+ HSPC 
will be administered  to the patient -subject on Study Day  0. 
• Highly -purified regulatory T -cells (“T reg cells” or T reg) are defined as 
CD4+ CD25+ CD127- Foxp3+ regulatory T -cells.  The T reg cells will be administered 
to the patient-subject on Study Day  0. 
2.1 Background/Rationale/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_644519]/Rationale/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_644520].  Myeloablative (MA) allogeneic HCT is their only chance for long term 
survival with disease free survival ranging from 10 to  50% and non- relapse mortality 
ranging from 30 to 50% .1,[ADDRESS_862688] from an 
HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) is 20 to 60% despi[INVESTIGATOR_644521], cyclosporine, methotrexate, 
mycophenolate, anti-thymocyte globulin and corticosteroids.2,3,4,[ADDRESS_862689] using a MSD and a T-cell replete graft will develop chronic GvHD.
6,7,8  
T-cell Depletion of Allografts:  
T-cell depletion (TCD) of donor grafts is an accepted method to prevent acute and 
chronic GvHD.  There is extensive experience with TCD of marrow grafts and such 
techniques have involved physical adsorption of T-cells to protein ligands such as lectins, 
elutriation and immuonadsorption or immunodeletion with T-cell or lymphocyte -specific 
monoclonal antibodies.  These methods have yielded results in marrow grafts ranging 
from 1.5 to 3.2log 10 T-cell depletion.  Much less is published regarding TCD of PBSC 
allografts .  However, in light of the evidence that the risk of acute and/or chronic GvHD 
may be greater with PBSC grafts, strategies for TCD of PBSC allografts is of 
considerable interest .  Using an immunoadsorption column or immunoaffinity 
techniques, investigators have performed TCD of GCSF-mobilized PBSC grafts and 
obtained T- cell log depletions ranging from 1 to  2.9 log depletion and with the incidence 
of grade 2 to 4 aGvHD ranging from 0 to 4%.  When G -CSF mobilized grafts from 
haploidentical donors were utilized, an immunoaffinity system (CliniMACS) achieved a 
4 to 5 log CD3+ depletion and a median CD3+ dose of 0.2 x 105/kg.  The incidence of 
aGvHD was <  10% despi[INVESTIGATOR_644522]-transplant GvHD prophylaxis.9-[ADDRESS_862690] as opportunistic infections especially in the setting of chronic GvHD .  
Peripheral blood T -lymphocyte counts do not return to normal levels until ~[ADDRESS_862691] .9,13,15  Additionally, when marrow grafts are TCD in the MSD setting, 
the risk of leukemia relapse is significantly higher especially for advanced phase acute 
leukemia patients.15  
2.2 Purified Regulatory T- cells  
 To ameliorate the impaired immune recovery and address the increased relapse incidence 
after TCD allografting, we will infuse conventional donor T- cells (T con) or “ T-cell 
addback” along with naturally occurring donor regulatory T- cells (T reg).  This allows 
assessment of the ability of T reg to reduce the extent and severity of GvHD and to 
ascertain the maximum tolerable dose of donor T con in relation to specific T reg doses .  To 
circumvent the potential acute GvHD associated with T-cell addback, the planned 
addition of T reg at appropriate numbers and ratios compared to T con will occur at a 
defined timepoint after hematopoietic cell infusion .  The scientific rationale for pursuing 
Treg in this setting arises from reports from several different laboratories demonstrating 
that highly purified T reg are capable of controlling GvHD and improving immune 
reconstitution in the preclinical setting .16,17,18,[ADDRESS_862692] previously demonstrated that adoptive transfer of T reg leads to abrogation 
of GvHD and accelerated donor lymphoid reconstitution of a diverse TCR- Vβ 
repertoire .20  Treg will be obtained by [CONTACT_644560] T- cells expressing the surface 
phenotype CD4+CD25+CD127-.  This population has been shown to express high levels 
of intracellular FoxP3+ which is curren tly the most reliable marker of T reg activity based 
on in vitro  assays and non- human animal models .  These cells a lso actively suppress the 
mixed  lymphocyte reaction .  Preliminary studies in the setting of cord blood 
transplantation and haploidentical transplantation are highly supportive of this concept .
21-22  
Dose Escalation  
A baseline cell dose of conventional T- cells of 1  x 106/kg will be used with escalation to 
the maximum tolerated dose up to 1 x 107/kg.  As demonstrated in mouse models of 
allogeneic HCT and in  vitro  assays, T reg can effectively suppress proliferation of 
alloreactive T- cells even when T con are added at 10-fold greater doses if the T reg are 
infused prior to the T con which allows for these cells to home to the proper 
microenvironment and proliferate.  The suppressive effect is most pronounced when T reg 
are added prior to T con.  Mice infused with donor T reg 48 hours before T con infusion show 
little, if any, evidence of GvHD  despi[INVESTIGATOR_644523].  This finding is 
replicated in the proposed transplant regimen.  In addition, the ratio of T con:Treg will be 
staggered to establish and confirm the ability of T reg to suppress alloreactivity at doses 
lower than the infused T con. 
In order to measure the impact of our intervention, at specified timepoints, before and 
after infusion of the planned dose of T reg and T con, we will measure immune 
reconstitution in the peripheral blood via immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] B- cell;  T-cell;  and 
NK subsets.  To ass ess the contribution of thymopoiesis to T- cell immune recovery after 
HCT, we will measure peripheral recent thymic emigrants by [CONTACT_644561]-[ADDRESS_862693] if the incidence of GVHD 
is different between subjects who receive T reg alone versus those who received single- agent 
prophylaxis and Treg.  A total of 24  subjects  will be required ( 2 arms of 12  each).  For the 
2nd stage, the better strategy will be used in the phase 2 stage 2 extension:  T reg alone v s Treg 
plus single -agent prophylaxis.  In the event of non- inferiority of the T reg alone arm, stage 2 
will use this treatment strategy.  A further 51  subjects would be enrolled in the Phase 2 
Stage  2 extension, enough to determine if there is a significant increase in GFRS (60%) 
from historic rates (40%).

reviewed .  The subject  is given a copy of the consent form to take home and read.  Then a 
meeting is scheduled with a clinical nurse specialist or research nurse to review the rationale, 
logistics, treatment plan, risks, benefits and consent form.  The subject's bill of rights is 
reviewed with an emphasis placed on voluntary participation.  Subject s are given time to ask 
questions and do not need to sign the consent form until they are ready to proceed.  In 
general, there is one hour devoted to the consent discussion with a clinical nurse specialist or 
research nurse educator.  The BMT attending physician is available to discuss the study with 
the subject at any time.  For pediatric subjects, all efforts will be made to have both parents 
sign.  If one parent is unable to sign, the reason will be documented. 
During the consent teaching, the physician, clinical nurse specialist or research nurse 
frequently asks questions of the subject to assess their understanding and a consent note is written documenting the subject s understanding.  For subject s that are not fluent in English, 
the consent procedure is performed with an interpreter present (or via telephone), or a signer for those that are hearing impaired.  Consents are translated into Spanish as needed. 
Subjects are evaluated by a physician, nurse coordinator, or clinical nurse specialist and

As shown in the Schema in Figure 1, box  “Cohort 1a,” dose escalation will start with : 
• Treg dose = 1  x 106/kg Treg enriched by [CONTACT_644572]25+ cells and 
further purified by [CONTACT_644573]4+CD127- population). 
• Tcon dose = 1  x 106/kg T con administered as unfractionated mobilized peripheral blood 
cells containing specified CD3+ cell dose  
4.9 Cell Source  
All cellular components will be obtained from matched donors mobilized with G- CSF 
[filgrastim  (Neupogen) or equivalent]  and collected by [CONTACT_644566][INVESTIGATOR_300614]  (SHC) or certified National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) collection centers as 
per current institutional allogeneic transplant protocols.  The clinical protocol requires 
3 cellular products for infusion as indicated in Figure  2, below : 
1) CD34+ HSPC :  The cell processing facility currently performs CD34 cell 
immunomagnetic selection  using the CliniMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) system.   
The CD34+ HSPC  will be infused on Day  0.  
2) T reg:  The selection of T reg will include a tandem selection procedure utilizing 
immunomagnetic selection on the CliniMACS Cell Selection System (Miltenyi  Biotec) 
followed by [CONTACT_644574]- speed cell sorter.   Treg will be 
enriched by [CONTACT_644575]25+ population and highly-purified to 
≅ 90% FoxP3+ cells by [CONTACT_644576]25+ cell fraction gated for selection of the 
CD4+CD127- population.  In our experience, cells recovered through this process are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] >  90% FoxP3+ (range 86% to  99%) with a mean of 95%, FoxP3+ cells in sorted 
Treg performed to date.  T reg isolation will use the flow- through fraction from the CD34 
selection as the cell source as depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2.   
The T reg product will be infused on Day  0 after the CD34+ are infused .  There will be 
a minimum of a 1 -hour interval between the end of the CD34+ product infusion and the 
start of the T reg infusion.  
3) T con.  This designation is used to indicate the infusion product containing the 
conventional T-cell dose.  The T con product will be obtained from the Day [ADDRESS_862715] will be based on the CD3+ cell content in order to assess GvHD risk.  
The T con product will be cryopreserved until the planned infusion on Day +[ADDRESS_862716] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Flow cytometry of

percentage of CD4+ CD25+ CD127- Foxp3+ regulatory T -cells in donor 
peripheral blood by [CONTACT_644578].  
b. Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) to show investigational drug product suppression potential in-vitro  by [CONTACT_644579] (donor T
regs) with 
activated responder cells (donor PBMCs). Responder cell numbers assessed 
after [ADDRESS_862723].  
Donor research samples are needed to characterize the T reg in the donor in order to understand 
how this might influence the efficacy of  the clinical trial results. In graft engineering, the 
measurement of cell subsets at the time of collection is important for understanding if  a sufficient 
collection  can be achieved .  
 
For example, CD34+ cells are measured in order to see if there are sufficient cells for 
hematopoietic engraftment.  It is critical to determine whether the count of T regs in the donor prior 
to collection correlates to the total T reg collected and outcome. This is accounted for through flow 
cytometry (a); to determine  if these T regs are functional, accounted for by [CONTACT_644580] (b) ; and need to 
know if factors in the donor graft like T- cell and B -cell diversity affect immune reconstitution

5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT/DEVICE/PROCEDURE INFORMATION 
5.1 Investigational Agent 
This protocol is submitted to  FDA IND [ZIP_CODE].  The specific investigational agent for 
which this IND was obtained was for “CD4+CD25+CD127-foxp3+ regulatory T- cells” 
referred to as T reg cells.   The IND application was submitted 4 April  2011, and was 
approved to proceed on 3 June 2011.  
6. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
6.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_119757].  The 
risk of treatment related morbidity and mortality following allogeneic transplant is related 
Confidential  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 27  of 58  04 Feb  20 22 to the underlying disease, disease status at the time of transplant, prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_644538] .  
Significant risks include:  
1)  Infection .  Risks include bone marrow suppression, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], invasive 
procedures, prior exposure to micro-organisms and immunosuppressive medications for the prevention and treatment of graft vs host disease.  Infections may be caused 
by [CONTACT_50904] ; viruses ; protozoa; or fungus.  
2)  Organ toxicity.  There is a risk of life- threatening toxicity to the heart ; lungs; liver ; 
kidney ; and brain.  Risks include prior therapy; concurrent health problems; and the 
high- dose chemotherapy and radiation used in the preparatory regimen.  
3)  Graft versus host disease.  Acute GvHD can range from a mild and treatable 
problem to a life-threatening complication.  Chronic GvHD can vary from a mild to an extensive disorder affecting almost any body tissue.  Chronic GvHD can negatively affect functional status and quality of life. 
4)  Secondary malignancies .  Radiation, chemotherapy and immunosuppressive 
medications increase the risk of secondary malignancies.  
5)  Graft failure .  Although rare, graft failure can be a fatal complication.  
6)  Infertility  in both genders and premature menopause in women at risk. 
7)  Relapse .  All subjects face a risk of relapse.  The risk is highest for those subjects 
with active or resistant disease at the time of transplantation.  
6.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions:  
Unanticipated Problem :  any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  (1)  Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation 
to (a) the research  risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and (b) the characteristics of the subject  population being studied; and  (2)  Is related or possibly 
related to participation in the research; and  (3) p laces subjects or others at a greater risk 
of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously know or recognized. 
Adverse Event :  Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does 
not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), a symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to medicinal product or treatment. 
Life-threatening Adverse Event:   Any adverse event that places the subject, in the view 
of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction .  
Confidential  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 28  of 58  04 Feb  20 22 Unexpected Adverse Event:   An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (Investigator’s Brochure, product 
insert).  For studies that do not involve investigational products or devices, an unexpected adverse event is an adverse event that is not described in the transplant medical literature or consent form. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life- threatening adverse event, a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly, requires intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment or damage ( 21CFR §312.32) .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_644539] 45 CFR§46, Subpart A 
which is the “Common Rule” for the Protection of Human Subjects, therefore, the 
Stanford IRB definition applies (report “unanticipated problems” involving risks to study 
participants or others) .  All grades 3 to 5 organ- related adverse events n ot due to the 
primary malignancy or pre-existing condition and concomitant medications will be 
collected fro m Day  0 through 90 days  after the T
con dose which is given on Day  +2, ie, 
through Day +[ADDRESS_862727].  
Grade 4 infusion reactions will be reported expeditiously  and as a separate listing in 
the FDA Annual Report.  
Distinction between Serious and Severe :  The term severe is used to describe the 
intensity (severity) of a specific event, for example mild, moderate or severe.  The event 
itself however, may be of relatively minor  medical significance, for example a severe 
headache.  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject /event outcome 
and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to the subject ’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.  
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an aggressive therapy for the treatment of a 
number of life threatening malignant and non-malignant disorders.  Individuals 
presenting for HCT generally have exhausted other avenues of therapy that will result in 
any lasting benefit.  The treatment related mortality (TRM) of autologous transplantation is approximately 5%.  The TRM of a sibling myeloablative allogeneic transplant is 
approximately 20% and the TRM for an unrelated myeloablative allogeneic transplant 
ranges from 20 to 50% .  
As an aggressive therapy HCT is associated with a large number of significant adverse 
and serious adverse events.  The toxicities associated with HCT are related to the 
following:  
1) Underlying disease 
2) Therapy antecedent to HCT  
3) Health status of the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_381204]- existing conditions  
4) High -dose preparative regimen employed in preparation for transplant 
5) Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_381205] 
(eg, immunosuppressants for the prevention of GvHD), and  
6) Treatment of complications of HCT.  
The use of toxicity grading scales such as the NCI CTC is a standard in the medical community for the reporting of SAEs in the investigation of new drugs or devices.  The 
Confidential  
IRB-[ADDRESS_862728]. 
The following SAEs require expedited reporting (as soon as possible but within at least 7 
calendar days of the investigator learning of the event):  
1) Deaths  
Death while the subject  is receiving treatment on t his protocol up to [ADDRESS_862729] be noted that obtaining detailed information on the cause and circumstances of a death 
occurring at another institution can be difficult.  Excludes deaths related to relapse of 
underlying disease, which will be reported at the time of protocol renewal.  
2) All serious and unexpected toxicities.  
Defined as those toxicities not identified in the transplant literature or in the consent 
form.  
The following will generally not be reported as SAEs: 
1) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] .  
Approximately 50% of allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_119760].  
The most common indications for readmission of an allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_119761], failure to maintain nutritional status and graft versus host disease.  
2) Relapse of disease. 
Relapse unfortunately remains a significant problem following both autologous and 
allogeneic transplantation.  The risk of relapse is influenced by [CONTACT_543156].  The risk of relapse following allogeneic transplant is extremely dependent on 
the disease being treated but ranges from 10% (for subject s with severe aplastic anemia) 
to 80% (for subjects with refractory acute leukemia).  
3) Common and expected G rade  [ADDRESS_862730] disease.

The occurrence of secondary malignancies and associated mortality is a known risk of 
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The occurrence of secondary malignancies will be reported at the time of the protocol annual review. 
 6.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
Protocol directors/principal investigators (PDs/PIs) are responsible for reporting any serious adverse events (SAEs) to both the IRB and regulatory authorities.  Stanford’s 
Human Subject Manual defines reportable events as “all serious adverse events, related 
or unrelated to the study treatment, occurring at Stanford or elsewhere, and unanticipated problems.”  The panel has established the reporting timeline as within five to fifteen days 
of first learning of the event.  PDs and PIs must also report any SAEs to the 
biopharmaceutical sponsor or FDA (when the PD acts as sponsor-investigator) according to 21CFR§312.32.  By  [CONTACT_108], serious adverse event is any untoward or unexpected 
event or medical occurrence, associated with the use of a drug or device or procedure that at any dose: results in death; is life- threatening; requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448]; results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  The term “unexpected” is 
used to further quantify an event/experience when it is not consistent with the current investigator brochure or with the risk information in the investigational plan.  
“Associated”  with the investigational drug/biologic/device means that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the experience/event may have been caused by [CONTACT_644587], at least in part, by [CONTACT_644588].  Finally, a “life 
-threatening” event means that in the view of the investigator, the event places the subject 
or subject at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred .  Timelines for 
reporting SAEs to sponsors or the FDA are more specific and depend on the outcome of 
the event (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, death).  
PDs and PIs are responsible for adhering to the timelines for reporting SAEs.  When the 
protocol director is the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_621142]/NCI/NHLBI sponsored study, 
the investigator must notify the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI or NHLBI 
by [CONTACT_644589] 4 and Grade 5 expected and unexpected events (see the Common Toxicity Criteria Index at www.ctep.nih.gov ) within [ADDRESS_862731] be completed and 
continued close follow -up is required until the event resolves.  
When a protocol director is both the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_644540] a clinical trial 
(investigator -initiated), the requirements for reporting all SAEs to the FDA and other 
investigators rest with the PD .  Specifically, the PD must notify the FDA of any 
study- related death or life -threatenin g event via telephone within 24 hours of learning of 
the event.  A written safety report (MedWatch  3500A) must be sent to the FDA within 
seven days.  Any other investigators who are participating in the study must be notified 
via an IND Safety Report within [ADDRESS_862732] 
manufacturing facility after administration  of any treatment component  , (ie,  Tcon;  
Confidential  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 31  of 58  04 Feb  20 22 CD34+ HSPC;  or T reg) to a study subject (whether fresh or cryopreserved), or after 
administration of the  product to the subject, the following steps will be initiated 
IMMEDIATELY:  
a. Clinical Laboratory personnel will notify the BMT -CTF, via the BMT- CTF IND  Manager 
or Medical  Director,  of positive test results.  
b. BMT -CTF personnel will notify the IND Sponsor- Investigator ( who is also the Stanford 
Protocol Director / Principal  Investigator ) at 650 -906-8582.  Information provided to the 
Sponsor- Investigator / Protocol  Director will include identification of which treatment 
component(s) are affected/were administered to the subject.  The Sponsor -Investigator will 
be updated with any substantive changes, including the final report on the identification and 
sensitivity from the positive sterility test.  
c. If the BMT -CTF personnel are unable to reach Sponsor- Investigator within [ADDRESS_862733] communication.  NOTE:  If not within 15  minutes, 
the Sponsor-Investigator will be notified as soon as possible.  The Sponsor-Investigator 
and/or designee will contact [CONTACT_30951], who will determine the extent of the 
work -up of a positive culture in consultation with appropriate infectious disease 
consultants, as well as determine an appropriate action treatment plan .  
d. The Sponsor- Investigator/attending physician will discuss the positive results with the 
subject, and specify the clinical therapy, antibiotic regimen and/or monitoring plan.  
e. A contaminated sample of a treatment component that has been administered to a subject 
will be handled in the same fashion as a Grade  4/[ADDRESS_862734] Protocol Director will be responsible to notify the IRB of the 
event via an Unanticipated Problem (UP) report within [ADDRESS_862735] is retained by [CONTACT_644590].  An 
Out-of-Specification  (OOS) Investigation will be conducted by [CONTACT_644591], review of viable environmental 
monitoring results collected at the time of manufacturing on personnel, equipment and 
reagents.  Whether or not attribution is established, a formal Corrective and Preventive Action plan will be issued by [CONTACT_644592] -CTF Quality staff and appropriate remediation will be 
performed including retraining of manufacturing personnel, elimination of any contaminated reagents and re-cleaning of the production facility followed by [CONTACT_644593].

7.1.1 Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Acute Leukemia – relapsed defined as  
a.  L eukemic blasts >  20% are documented in the blood or bone marrow after HCT  
b.  Leukemic blasts >  5% and <  20% are documented in the blood or bone marrow 
and supported by [CONTACT_644594] 
c.  Leukemic blasts > 5% and <  20% are documented in the blood or bone marrow 
on at least 2 occasions  
d.  L eukemia detected at an extramedullary site or the appearance of new dysplastic 
changes within the bone marrow or % blasts  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia  – relapsed defined as  
a.  I mmature hematopoietic cells are  persistently documented in the peripheral 
blood, or 
b. Myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow in the presence of a cytogenetic relapse 
as defined by: 
- 50% of the metaphases exhibit the characteristic 9;[ADDRESS_862739] 1 metaphase exhibits the 9;[ADDRESS_862740] 1 month apart, regardless of number of metaphases analyzed  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Myelodysplastic syndrome  
a.  A ppearance of pre- transplant morphologic abnormalities detected in 
[ADDRESS_862741] 50% of 
metaphases with at least ten metaphases examined or  
d. Reappearance of pre- transplant cytogenetic abnormality in at least [ADDRESS_862742]  1 month  apart, 
regardless of the number of metaphases analyzed  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hodgkin and Non -Hodgkin lymphoma  (relapse defined below)   
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm 
regardless of the short axis.  If a lymph  node has a long axis of 1.1 to  1.5 cm, it 
Confidential  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 36  of 58  04 Feb  20 22 should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more than 1.0 cm.  Lymph 
nodes ≤ 1.0 x ≤  1.0cm will not be considered as abnormal for relapse or progressive 
disease.  
i. Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.[ADDRESS_862743] a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules).  To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of 
the short axis of less than 1.[ADDRESS_862744] increase by ≥  50% and to a size of 
1.[ADDRESS_862745] a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previou sly identified 
node more than 1 cm  in its short axis  
iv. Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]-avid lymphoma or 
the lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be 
detected with current PET systems (<  1.[ADDRESS_862746]).  Measurable 
extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal 
disease.  For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease.  
Disease that is only assessable ( eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be 
recorded as present or absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by 
[CONTACT_20478], it is found to be histologically negative.  
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majority of participants, or 
where PET is not deemed necessary or appropriate for use, response should be assessed as above, but only using CT scans.  However, residual masses should not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial responses. 
 
8. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Monitoring plan 
The Monitoring Entity (ME) that will be responsible for monitoring the data collected, 
including data related to unanticipated problems and adverse events, and their respective 
roles (eg, Stanford Cancer Center, CRC, investigator, sponsor, coordinating or statistical 
center, independent medical monitor, DSMB/DSMC, or some other entity).  If there is no ME, then the Protocol Director (PD) is responsible for this function. 
Primary internal data monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_644542] .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_461199], as well as the 
safety of the subjects.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12762].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_644543], reporting adverse events, assuring that 
consent is obtained and documented, reporting of unexpected outcomes, and reporting the 
Confidential  
IRB-[ADDRESS_862747] DSMC 
audits all investigator -initiated studies on an annual basis and submits a DSMC report to 
the Principal Investigator .  
The content of this DSMC report  is comprised of an overall rating  of the study audit , 
(Outstanding, Satisfactory, Minor Deficiencies, or Major Deficiencies) that is a 
composite of overall study conduct and the findings of the audit session.  In rating the 
conduct of the study, the DSMC categorizes deviations  as Major, Moderate or Minor .  
The report also contains the specific recommendation from the committee, which can 
consist either of Full Approval, Conditional Approval, Suspension of defer to the SRC for closure.  
8.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]  (for the individual subject and for the study as a whole)  
As indicated in the dose escalation schema (Figure  1), any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_50584] a dose cohort 
showing GvHD > Grade  2 will require trigger the inclusion of three additional recipi[INVESTIGATOR_644544].  Dose escalation will proceed if none of the additional recip ients show 
GvHD > Grade 2 ; Grade  [ADDRESS_862748]; or G rade 3  to 5 
cytokine release syndrome / acute infusion reaction. 
8.3 Data management  
i)  Research records are maintained in a secure office of the data management staff.  Electronic data is maintained in a secure database.  
ii)  Research samples are sent to the SCTT lab for coding prior to the freezing or

 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a p hase [ADDRESS_862753] s per group.  The initial doses and 
ratios utilized will be 1  x 106/kg of T  reg cells to 1  x 106/kg of T con  cells at a 1:[ADDRESS_862754]  develops G rade 3 or 4 GvHD, then the dose escalation will be 
stopped. 
Confidential  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 40  of 58  04 Feb  20 22 9.1 Endpoints 
A. Endpoint for Safety  
This is a phase  1 dose finding trial with two degrees of freedom in the definition of dose 
(numbers of  T reg  and T con , or, equivalently, the number of T con and the ratio of T reg to 
Tcon).  These ‘dose pairs’ act in different directions to produce the resulting rates of 
GvHD, and presumably, anti- tumor activity.  The study will follow a traditional 3+[ADDRESS_862755] s in each cohort.  At all levels, progression to the next cohort will 
be dependent on no occurrence of > grade  [ADDRESS_862756] and Grade 3 to 5 
cytokine release syndrome / acute infusion reaction.  
If at any point, a predefined DLT is observed, then the cohort is expanded to (no more 
than) 6 total at that dose pair.  If no further grade 3 or 4 GvHD or pre-defined DLT is 
observed (so the total is now 1/6), the MTD is declared and in that case the cohort at that dose pair is ex panded by [CONTACT_8622] 12 subjects (in  2 cohorts of 6) for a total of [ADDRESS_862757]  expansion, the observed G rade 3 or 4 GvHD  
rate or pre -defined DLT rises to 50% or above, the next lower dose of T
con at the ratio of 
1:[ADDRESS_862758] determined that 40% represents the “unacceptable’ failure rate to 
reach target T reg  dose.  In the event that the observed failure rate in a dose cohort implies 
that the true failure rate exceeds 40%, w ith 80% confidence , then we will de -escalate T 
reg dose and treat subject s on a previous dose level .  We will assess the failure rate after 
each cohort of 6 and in the expanded cohort of 12.  If we see 4 failures out of 6 tries in a 
cohort, or 7 failures out of 12, this feasibility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_644545] -escalated.  See t able below. 
Observed Failures / Subject  cohort  80% Lower Confidence Limit for 
True Failure Rate  
4 / 6 0.41 
7 / [ADDRESS_862759]  is the occurrence of G rade 3 or 4 
GvHD, as defined above. 
Phase  2 Primary Objective  
Once the MTD is determined, it is proposed to expand the cohort at that dosage into a 
single -arm, phase 2 admissible Simon 2 -stage proof -of-concept study, continuing with 
HLA-matched donors (related or unrelated).  The Primary Objective of the phase  [ADDRESS_862760] will be used as the comparator, documented as 
~40% 1- year GR FS in a comparable patient population receiving T -cell replete grafts.  
GRFS  is defined as the minimum time from HCT to relapse ; GvHD; or death .  The 
anticipated 1 -year GRFS  probability is 60% and the lower boundary for proceeding to a 
possible phase  3 trial is an GRFS  probability of >  0.40.  The primary hypothesis can be 
described as H 0: p ≤ 0.40 versus H 1: p > 0.40.  When the true GRFS  percentage is 60% 
with a sample size of 41, there is 80% power at one- sided α  = .05 to rule out a GRFS  
percentage of <  40%. 
An “Admissible Simon’s two -stage design” (Simon, 1989) will be used. The null 
hypothesis that the true 1 -year GRFS is 40% will be tested against a one- sided 
alternative. The probability of early termination under the null hypothesis is 64%. In the 
first stage, 17 patients will be accrued. If there are 7 or fewer successes in these 17 
patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 24 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 41. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 22 or more responses are observed in

9.2.1 Background and Demographic Characteristics  
We will tabulate and summarize all background and demographic characteristics.  
9.2.2 Evaluation of Efficacy 
The OS and GRFS  estimates at the MT D dose pair will be calculated according to the 
methods of Kaplan and Meier and will be calculated from Day  0 of infusion of CD34+ 
selected peripheral blood stem cells.  At the sample size (41 ) of the expanded cohort, the 
distance from the proportion surviving [ADDRESS_862762] one- sided lower 90% 
confidence limit of that proportion is no more than 12%, illustrating the precision of the 
estimates of survival parameters.  
9.2.3 Methods for handling missing data and non- adherence to protocol  
No missing data expected; in the event of non-adherence, DLTs will be counted in any subject who receives any dose of cells.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_862763] of trial (including accrual rates, data quality)  
Accrual rates will be reported to the DSMC and data quality will be reviewed by [CONTACT_244711].  
9.2.[ADDRESS_862764] regression methods, assuming a range of 
doses are explored .  The results will be descriptive, given the early phase of the study and 
small sample size, but estimates of confidence intervals for all summaries will be provided. 
9.3 Sample Size  
9.3.1 Accrual estimates  
The number of subjects accrued during the Phase 1 component of the trial was 13.  The 
maximum tolerated dose  (MTD)  was determined to be 3 x 10
6 Tcon cells /kg in 
combination with 3 x 106 Treg cells /kg. 
This study’s admissible  Simon t wo-stage design is intended to evaluate the  
immune -suppressant (IS) combination, as well as efficacy and toxicity of the 
graft -engineered product.  
In study phase 2, Stage 1, t he trial will enroll [ADDRESS_862765]  + IS  vs graft- engineered product  alone.  
In the 1st stage, the trial investigates if the rate of G vHD is non- inferior for the 
graft -engineered product with and without IS . 
In study phase 2, Stage 2, if the GvHD rate is found to be non- inferior between the 
[ADDRESS_862766] alone.  Based on the admissible  Simon two -stage design [2] the 
null hypothesis that the true 1-year GRFS is 40% will be tested against a one- sided 
alternative. The probability of early termination under the null hypothesis is 64%. In the 
first stage, 17 patients will be accrued. If there are 7 or fewer successes in these 17 
patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 24 additional patients will be accrued for a 
total of 41. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 22 or more responses are observed in 41 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 5% and power of 80% when the true 1-year GRFS is 60% . See a table below .

will be treated at the previous dose level following the Schema in Figure  2.  
The Phase  2 part of this has a planned sample size of 41  subjects based on the true EFS 
being 60%.  This sample size provides 80% power at α  = .05 to rule out a EFS percentage 
of < 40% .  Given the complexity of the intervention, we consider the 60% EFS target as 
the smallest improvement on our historical control rate of 40% that would justify 
continuing to use this treatment concept as the basis for further development.

ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING AND REPORTING 
Definitions:  
Unanticipated Problem  
Any incident , experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria: (1) .  Is expected in 
terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to (a) the research risks that are described in the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or 
other study documents, and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and  
(2) Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  (3)  Places subjects or others 
at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously know or recognized. 
Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), a symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure 
whether or not considered related to medicinal product or treatment.  
Life-threatening Adverse Event  
Any adverse event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (Investigator’s Brochure, product insert).  For studies that do not involve investigational products or devices, an unexpected adverse event is an adverse event that is not described in the transplant medical literature or consent form.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the following outcomes:  death, a life -
threatening adverse event, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly, requires intervention to prevent permanent impairm ent or damage (21CFR§312.32) .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_644556] 45 CFR§46, Subpart A which is the “Common Rule” for the Protection of Human 
Subjects, therefore, the Stanford IRB definition applies (report “unanticipated problems” involving risks to study participants or others). 
Distinction between Serious and Severe  
The term severe is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, for example mild, 
moderate or severe.  The event itself however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, for example a severe headache.  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the 
subject /event outcome and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to the subject ’s life 
or functioning.  Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
Confidential  
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 56  of 58  04 Feb  20 22 Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an aggressive therapy for the treatment of a number 
of life threatening malignant and non-malignant disorders.  Individuals presenting for HCT 
generally have exhausted other avenues of therapy that will result in any lasting benefit.  The TRM of a sibling myeloablative allogeneic transplant is approximately 20% and the TRM for an 
unrelated myeloablative allogeneic transplant ranges from 20 to 50%.  In the setting of a 
non-myeloabative allogeneic transplant from a sibling donor the TRM is approximately 10% and 
ranges from 20 to 50% for unrelated donors.  
As an aggressive therapy HCT is associated with a large number of AEs and SAEs.  The toxicities associated with HCT are related to the following :  1) the underlying disease;  2) therapy 
antecedent to HCT ;  3) the health status of the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_381204]- existing 
conditions ;  4) the preparative regimen employed in prior to transplant;  5) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_644557] ( eg, immunosuppressants for the prevention of GvHD);  
and 6) the treatment of complications of HCT.  
The use of toxicity grading scales such as the NCI CTC is a standard in the medical community 
for the reporting of AEs and SAEs in the investigation of new drugs or devices.  The use of this type of scale is less helpful in the evaluation of AEs and SAEs associated with a treatment, such 
as HCT.  In an effort to report to regulatory agencies the toxicities that are relevant and 
meaningful for the evaluation of risks and benefits to potential HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_381206].  
The following SAEs require reporting to the CCTO.  If the event is unexpected, it will also require reporting to the IRB: 
1)  Deaths  
All deaths while the subject is receiving treatment on a protocol up to [ADDRESS_862781] dose 
of protocol treatment o r any death that occurs more 90  days (allogeneic) after protocol 
treatment has ended that is felt to be treatment related.  
This includes deaths from the common and expected Grade [ADDRESS_862782] be noted that 
obtaining detailed information on the cause and circumstances of a death occurring at another 
institution can be difficult.  Excludes deaths related to relapse of underlying disease, which 
will be reported at the time of protocol renewal.  
2) All serious and unexpected toxicities .  
Defined as those toxicities not identified in the transplant literature, product inserts or in the consent form.  
The following will generally not be reported as AEs or SAEs: 
1)  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Approximately 50% of allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_119760].  
The most common indications for readmission of an allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_119761] ;

IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 57  of 58  04 Feb  20 22 2)  Relapse of disease.  
Relapse unfortunately remains a significant problem following both autologous and 
allogeneic transplantation.  The risk of relapse is influenced by [CONTACT_543156].  
3)  Common and expected G rade [ADDRESS_862783] inserts or stated in the consent form and do not result in death.  This includes but is not limited to neutropenia ;  thrombocytopenia ;  anemia ;  thrombotic 
microangiopathy;  bleeding requiring transfusions ;  edema ;  hypertension ;  hypotension ;

schedules of oral MLN0128 + MLN1117 in patients with advanced nonhematologic 
malignancies

4.4 Study Design
This study is a multicenter, open-label, phase 1b trial of MLN0128 (an oral mTORC1/2 
inhibitor) in combination with MLN1117 (an oral inhibitor of the PI3K ∀isoform) when 
administered to adult patients with advanced nonhematological malignancies for whom standard, 
curative, or life- prolonging anticancer treatment does not exist or is no longer effective.  The 
study will consist of 2 stages:  a (dose) Escalation Stage followed by [CONTACT_348937].  In the 
Escalation Stage, 2 dosing regimens for the combination will be evaluated in separate treatment Company Confidential Information
C32001 Page 8 of 26
Statistical Analysis Plan 18Aug 2016
CONFIDENTIALarms.  The phrase “study drug” or “MLN0128 + ML N1117” refers to combination dosing of 
MLN0128 + MLN1117.
In the Escalation Stage, patients will be enrolled into dose escalation cohorts at different 
combination doses and schedules of MLN0128 and MLN1117 using a standard 3 + 3 approach to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and/or recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) in each treatment arm and optimal dosing schedules to be implemented in the Expansion Stage.  
Study drug will be administered in 28-day cycles.  In Treatment Arm A, MLN0128 will be 
administered once daily every day (QD) a nd MLN1117 will be administered once daily on 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (MWF) of each week.  In Treatment Arm B and Arm C, both MLN0128 and MLN1117 will be administered QD on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday 
(MTuW) of each week.
Patients will be enrolled in the Expansion Stag e to further characterize the safety, tolerability, 
PK, and pharmacodynamics of MLN0128 in combin ation with MLN1117.  This stage will 
consist of a Mutual DDI PK Expansion Cohort and tumor-specific cohorts.  The combination 
dose and schedule from 1 of the treatment arms evaluated in the Escalation Stage will be 
implemented in the Mutual DDI PK Expansion Cohort.  The combination of doses and schedules from any of the treatment arms evaluated in the Escalation Stage ma y be implemented in each 
individual tumor-specific expansion cohort.  Th e tumor types selected for evaluation in the 
Expansion Stage will be based on safety a nd antitumor activity observed during Study C32001, 
by [CONTACT_827988]0128 and/or MLN1117 clinical studies, and by [CONTACT_827989].  Likewise, th e schedules for combination dosing in an 
individual tumor-specific cohort of the Expansion Stage will be based on clinical observations 
made during the Escalation Stage.  The dose, schedule, and selection of tumor types for the 
tumor-specific cohorts will be identified in a protocol amendment.  
Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Ve rsion 4.03, eff ective date 14 June 2010.   AEs will be 
assessed, and laboratory values, vital signs, physical exam findings, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MLN0128 + MLN1117.

CONFIDENTIAL6.0 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
To estimate the number of patients for this study , it is assumed that 15% of enrolled pat ients will 
be non-evaluable .  Approximately  152 pati ents will  be enrolled into this study .
Of the 152 patient estimated to be enro lled, approximately 72 will be enro lled into the Escalat ion 
Stage.  These patients will be divided into treatment arms which differ in co mbinat ion dosing 
schedules to determine the MTDs and/or RP2Ds of MLN0128 + MLN1117 in each treatment 
arm.  The number o f patients enrolled in the Escalation Stage was determined by [CONTACT_827990] a DLT.  It is estimated that [ADDRESS_1148865] deviat ion (SD), m edian, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and the 
number and percent (of non -missing) per category  for catego rical data, unl ess specified 
otherwi se.  
Means and medians will be presented to [ADDRESS_1148866] deviat ions (SDs) will be presented to 2 more decimal places than the recorded data. 
Unless otherwise specified, summ ary tabulati ons will  be presented for each 
MLN0128/MLN1117 dose level wit hineach of the treatment arms, total for each treatm ent arm , 
total for the dose escal ation cohort ,and for the mutual DDI PK expansio n cohort .
Unless otherwise specified, the baselin e value is defined as the value co llected at the time closest 
to, but prior to, the start of study  drug administration. Cycle 1 day  1 values are considered pre -
dose.   Screening values are co nsidered baseline values if a cycle 1 day value is unavailable. 
All statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS® Versi on 9.4.
7.1.1 Conventions for Missing Adverse Event Dates
Adverse events with start dates that are completely or partially missing will be analyzed as 
follows:
If the start date has a monthand year but the day is missing, the event will be considered
treatm ent emergent if the month and y ear of  the start date of the event are:
oOn or after the month and y ear of  the date of the first dose of study  drug
and
oOn or before the month and year of the date of the last d ose of study  drug pl us 30
days
If the start date has a year, but the day and m onth are missing, the event will be
considered treatment emergent if the year of the start date of the event is:
C32001 Page 13of [ADDRESS_1148867] us 30 day s
If the start date of an event is completely missing then the event is assumed to be 
treatm ent emergent.
However, if the end date is complete or partially missing but it is clear that the end date is before 
the first dose of study  drug, the event will not be considered treatment emergent.

profiles and for the estimation of the PK parameters.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Concentrations
Descriptive statistics (number of patients, arithmetic mean, arithmetic standard deviation, 
arithmetic coefficient of variation, geometri c mean, median, minimum, and maximum) will be

Cycle 1 Day 24 for each MLN0128/MLN117 dose level within each arm in the dose escalation 
cohort, and on cycle [ADDRESS_1148873] quantifiable point will be considered missing.
Linear and semi-logarithmic plots of the mean plasma concentration versus scheduled sampling 
time will be provided on Cycle 1 Day 1 a nd Cycle 1 Day 24 for each MLN0128/MLN117 dose

MLN1117 alone (C1D17) versus MLN0128+MLN1117 (C1D10).
In the Mutual DDI PK Expansion Cohort the amount of MLN0128 and MLN1117 excreted in 
urine will be determined based upon urine concentration of each agent and the cumulative 
volume of urine collected during the 0- 8h collection duration, as specified in the protocol.
The renal clearance of MLN0128 and MLN1117 will be determined by [CONTACT_827992]0128 and MLN1117 excreted in urine from 0-8h post-dose to the plasma AUC0-8h. These parameters will be listed and summarized for the mutual DDI PK expansion cohort.

For those laboratory  tests not assi gned NCI -CTCAE toxicit y grades the number and proportion 
of patients wi th shifts in laboratory  values to outside the laboratory  norm al range relat ive to the 
baseline value will be summarized. 
Laboratory  data will be summarized by[CONTACT_161767]0128/MLN1117 dose level within each of the 
treatm ent arm s, total  for each treatment arm , total  for the dose escalat ion cohort , and for the 
mutual  DDI PK expa nsion cohort. 
7.11.3 Vital Signs
Vital sign resul ts (di astolic and systolic blood pressure) and body  weight will be summarized as 
follows:
Baseline value
Minimum post -baseline value
Change to Minimum post -baseline value
Maximum post -baseline value
Change to Maximum post -baseline value

CONFIDENTIAL7.11.4 12-Lead ECGs
Selected ECG parameters (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc (Fridericia) will be 
summarized as fo llows:
Baseline value
Minimum post -baseline value
Change to Minimum post -baseline value
Maximum post -baseline value
Change to Maximum post-baseline value   
All QT values will be converted to QTcF using Fridericia’s correction:
(sec)
[Note: RR = 60 seconds /ventricular rate in beats/minute ]
The change from baseline in QT/QTc interval and the number and percent of subjects with 
increases >30 ms and > 60 ms will be summarized.   
ECG data will be summarized by [CONTACT_161767]0128/MLN1117 dose level wit hin each of the treatment

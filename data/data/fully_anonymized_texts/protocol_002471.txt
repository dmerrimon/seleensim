Brief Summary of Research (250-400 words):  
There are many benefits to minimally invasive surgery such as smaller incisions, decreased blood loss, 
less pain, shorter recovery time, and economic enticement.  Same-day discharge after laparoscopic 
surgery has been shown to be safe and cost-effective; however some patients who are otherwise eligible 
for discharge require an overnight admission for pain management. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886260], such as increased risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886261], respi[INVESTIGATOR_886262].  Given the rising cost of health care there is 
also an economic incentive to eliminate the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886263]-operative pain.  
 
Acupuncture is a safe, non-addictive alternative therapy, which has been noted to successfully decrease 
pain. However, to our knowledge, there has never been a study that looks at the difference in post-
operative narcotic use in patients undergoing minimally invasive gynecological procedures that receive 
acupuncture pre-operatively. 
 
In our study, we will recruit female patients over the age of eighteen who have been previously 
scheduled to undergo a benign gynecological laparoscopic procedure.  All patients consented will be 
eligible for same-day discharge.   
 
Once consented, participants will be randomized into the pre-operative acupuncture (study) or  sham 
acupuncture (control) group using a computer generated randomization system. There will be a total of 
[ADDRESS_1240152] five superficial needles in specific predetermined locations on the

1) Objectives 
Research Question:  Does the use of acupuncture decrease narcotic consumption in post-
operative gynecological patients? 
Hypothesis: Narcotic consumption at 24 hours in acupuncture group (study) versus sham 
ac
upuncture group (control).  
Narcotic abuse and addiction are quickly becoming a very large concern in our health care 
system. It is our goal to find a safe, effective, and non-addictive alternative for post-
operative pain management in order to decrease the amount of narcotics needed.  
2) Background 
Minimally invasive gynecological surgery has many benefits over traditional open method surgery such 
as shorter recovery time, less adhesion formation, decreased cost and possibly shorter operative time. (1) 
With these characteristics, laparoscopy allows for better pain control which in turn leads to decreased 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886264]. It has even led to a new era in gynecological surgery marked by [CONTACT_886274] a several-day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. This decreases hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886265]-borne pathogens.  In Gynecology and General Surgery, studies have demonstrated that the 
majority of patients who had same-day discharge as their procedure were highly satisfied to have gone 
home instead of stay overnight in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. (2) Pain control is essential to achieving same-day 
discharge and patient satisfaction after a procedure.  Currently, narcotics are first-line for post-operative 
pain control but have become increasingly controversial secondary to the growing epi[INVESTIGATOR_886266]. Therefore, it would be beneficial for patients who undergo gynecological surgery to 
find alternative methods of pain control in an effort to lessen the amount of pain medication required post-
operatively. Ideally, this will enhance the benefits of laparoscopy and further decrease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886267].  
Acupuncture is a 2000-year-old technique using the application of fine needles in strategic places on the 
body. It has been proven to be safe, effective and non-addicting. (3) Studies have been performed in other 
surgical fields that demonstrate the effectiveness of intraoperative acupuncture for controlling post-

operative day one pain control than the patients who received sham intraoperative acupuncture. (4) In 
another study, by [CONTACT_886275]., intraoperative acupuncture was administered at the time of tonsillectomy 
and was shown to significantly improve subjective post-operative pain and led to earlier oral intake, a 
marker of pain control, than the study subjects who did not receive intraoperative acupuncture. (5)  
Wetzel et al. demonstrated that patients receiving auricular acupuncture during total hip arthroplasty 
required 15% less fentanyl than patients who received placebo acupuncture during the same procedure. 
(6) In these studies, and several others involving acupuncture during the pre- and post-operative period, 
acupuncture been used safely and effectively and has been demonstrated to improve patient care in terms 
of pain control and traditional analgesic intake.  
Narcotic abuse and addiction is a fast rising concern in post-operative patients. Past research has shown 
acupuncture to be effective in post-operative pain control, but no studies have looked specifically at 
gynecological patients. Our study has the potential to decrease the amount of narcotics prescribed post-
operatively to women undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery and to decrease the rate of 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959].

Between the three of them, over [ADDRESS_1240156]. Ascher-Walsh it is estimated that 85% of 
patients will choose to participate.  [CONTACT_886287], an Assistant Professor at Mount Sinai 
and Licensed Acupuncturist, will be available to perform intra-operative acupuncture for the first 
two gynecological cases three days a week. Given this participation rate and the availability of

population means of the experimental and control groups are equal and discern a difference of 1.5, 
with probability (power) 0.8.    The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null 
hypothesis is 0.05.  
 
d) Study Timelines 
The anticipated duration of the study is [ADDRESS_1240162]-operative visits 2 weeks after the 
procedure.  
 
e) Endpoints 
The purpose of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in post-operative 
pain management in laparoscopic gynecological procedures. The endpoints of this study are narcotic 
use at [ADDRESS_1240163]’s participation to end are contact [CONTACT_886277]. This is a very uncommon response. 
 
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research 
Female subjects who are scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic surgery of the uterus, adnexa or 
ovaries for benign disease. All procedures will be performed for clinical patient care and not solely for 
research purposes. Patients will be offered enrollment in the study during their pre-operative visit with 
[CONTACT_360045]-Walsh, [CONTACT_886286], and [CONTACT_886285] and consented by [CONTACT_886278].  
Once consented, participants will be randomized into the acupuncture (study) or sham acupuncture 
(control) group using a computer-generated randomization system. The patient will be blinded to the 
group to which they are assigned.  
After general anesthesia induction and proper positioning of the patient, but prior to surgical incision , 
the acupuncture needles will be placed.   . In the study group, the proposed acupuncture points are 
LR-3, GB-41, GB-34, TH-5, MH-6, which are all found on upper and lower extremities. Standard

treatments, the needles will be left in-situ for a total of 15 minutes. In the control group, the primary 
surgeon (who has no acupuncture experience) will quickly place 5 needles in random spots on the 
patients’ hands and feet. The needles will be immediately removed. Anesthesiologists will be 
informed to not make any alterations in their typi[INVESTIGATOR_886271].  
Nursing staff will record the kind and dose of pain medications the patient requires in the PACU. This 
information will also be recorded on the data sheet. After four hours, [CONTACT_360045]-Walsh will determine 
if the patients will be discharged home or admitted. Reasons for admission include but are not limited 
to inadequate pain control, hemodynamic instability, conversion of laparoscopic case to laparotomy, 
or other adverse outcomes that necessitate close monitoring. Criteria for discharge include adequate 
pain control, hemodynamic stability, and patient ability to ambulate and tolerate oral intake. 
Assessment of pain medications used will occur at hours [ADDRESS_1240165]-operative visit.  
 
The data will be analyzed and stored by [CONTACT_5051].  
 
g) Specimen Banking 
There will be no specimen banking  
 
h) Data Management and Confidentiality 
The data will be stored in password-protected spreadsheets in which the subject’s identity will be de-
identified with a unique coding system. The research data and linking codes will be filed separately.   
Data will be stored separately from unique identifiers that can link the data to a person’s identity. All 
computer files will be stored on computers connected with the MSSM server, and will also be 
password protected and viewed only by [CONTACT_5051]. Data will be stored indefinitely and will 
only be accessible by [CONTACT_886279]. The data will include demographic information (the subject 
code, age, operation performed, study group) and outcome measure data including pain scale 
numbers, amount of pain medications taken, and quality of life survey answers.  
 
SPSS will be used for the data analysis. A power analysis was performed using prior data of narcotic 
use in [CONTACT_360045] -Walsh’s post -operative gynecological patients. This data demonstrated the 
average number of narcotic tablets c onsumed at [ADDRESS_1240166] deviation of 2.4. 
Overall we are aiming to achieve a decrease of 50% (or 1.5 tablets) for post -operative narcotic use at 
[ADDRESS_1240167] of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  
Further Data analysis will be performed using SPSS.  The analysis of pain medication use and 
admission rate will be performed using student t- tests and regression analyses.

Phone Number: 212- 241-2827  
Email: [EMAIL_16854] 
2. The choice of principal monitor is appropriate to assess the risks to the participants because he 
is the lead attending in this study and the attending physician of all of the study participants. He 
has done a large amount of gynecology research and has ample experience in assessing the 
safety and well-being of the participants. 
3. All adverse events including contact [CONTACT_886280]. In 
addition the efficacy of the acupuncture in reducing pain will be determined. 
4. The data will be analyzed after [ADDRESS_1240168]. Control needles will be placed superficially in predetermined locations. 
These needles will only puncture the skin and then will be immediately removed.  
9. The data will be collected and stored in an organized fashion and will be checked by [CONTACT_886281]. 
10. If the patient is negative impacted in any manner, it will be reported to the IRB.  
 
j) Withdrawal of Subjects 
Subjects will be able to withdraw from the study at any time, except during the surgical procedure. 
It is not anticipated that subjects will be withdrawn from the study without their consent. If a

6) Risks to Subjects 
Acupuncture will be given in a sterile fashion and the time it takes for a licensed 
acupuncturist to place the needles is less than [ADDRESS_1240170] from work from the effects of acunpuncture.    
There always exists the potential for loss of private information; however, there are 
procedures in place to minimize this risk. These include utilizing a unique coding system 
that de-identifies subjects and stores data separately from unique identifiers and 
safeguarding private information in a password-protected database. 
If a study subject believes that she has suffered an injury related to this research as a 
participant in this study, she should contact [CONTACT_079], [CONTACT_360045]-Walsh.  
If a subject suffered a complication of surgery related to the study, medical care will be 
provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ascher-Walsh and consulting physicians as necessary.  Generally, this 
medical care will be billed to the subject and/or her health insurance. In some cases, the 
costs of this care may be paid for by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ascher-Walsh. 
 
7) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
If you are injured or made sick from taking part in this research study, medical care will be 
provided. Generally, this care will be billed to you or your insurance in the ordinary manner and 
you will be responsible for all treatment costs not covered by [CONTACT_123864], including 
deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance.  This does not prevent you from seeking payment for 
injury related to malpractice  or negligence . Contact [CONTACT_219723].

Revised 9/2/14 8) Potential Benefits to Subjects 
It is important to know that the subject may not get any benefit from taking part in this 
research.  Others may not benefit either.  However, possible benefits may be a reduction 
in pain post operatively. The subject may have a decreased need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_786163], decreased length of stay in the post anesthesia care unit and lower chance 
of needing admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886272].  
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects 
Subjects will be consented by [CONTACT_886282] a fellow in a 
private environment. All aspects of the office visits and surgery will be conducted in 
private. During surgery care is taken to keep the patient covered with a gown and sheets 
and to minimize exposure. Post operatively pain will be assessed privately. When the 
patients are called at home for post-operative follow up the researchers will only speak 
directly to the patient and will not leave messages or voice mails regarding the study. No 
general health information or information relating to the study will be discussed in the 
presence of family or friends accompanying the patient unless explicitly allowed by [CONTACT_1560].   
 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects 
There is no cost to the patient for participating in this study beyond those which the patient 
would pay for the medical care involved. Economic risks due to time away from work or 
loss of function are also no greater than if the surgery was performed independent of the 
study. 
 
11) Payments to Subjects 
    There is no financial incentive to participate. 
. 
12) Consent Process 
Potential study subjects will be informed and consent obtained in the outpatient setting during their 
pre-operative visit.The potential subjects will have adequate time to review the material, free of time 
constraint or a sense of obligation or coercion. Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_6283]. Ascher-Walsh , 
Mamik or Fenske or by [CONTACT_886283]-operative visit in their private office, not 
immediately pre-operatively. The consent process will take place in a private room, not in a public 
area, such as a waiting room or public holding area. Prior studies have shown the average time to 
appropriately consent a patient during a pre-operative visit is [ADDRESS_1240171] 10 
minutes to each individual consent process, however more time will be available if needed to 
address all patient questions and concerns. Patients will be given a copy of the study template and 
consent document, which will be available in English.

Study Des cription : The Children’s Cochlear Implant Center at UNC has seen evidence of 
postoperative hearing preservation in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_604502]. The 
primary aim of this study is to investigate speech perception performance 
in pediatric CI recipi[INVESTIGATOR_604503] -operative hearing . 
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective:   To determine if listening with electric -acoustic 
stimulation (EAS) provides improved speech understanding over listening

 Secondary Objectives :  
1. To compare the pre -operative speech perception and quality of life 
scores with traditional hearing aids to post -operative scores listening with 
a CI alone in children with pre -operative low frequency hearing.  
 2. To determine if listening with EAS achieves better performance and/or 
subjective benefit as compared to pre-operative findings with 
conventional amplification . 
 3. To evaluate the differences in identification of questions vs answers in 
children listening to EAS vs CI -alone programs.

Description of 
Sites /Facilities  Enrolling 
Participants : Subjects will be seen and enrolled at The University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill. Physical locations include  The Children’s Cochlear Implant 
Center at UNC and the Carolina Crossing satellite clinic.   
Description of Study  
Intervention : The MED -EL EAS System is capable of provid ing electric stimulation to the 
mid- to high -frequency region of the cochlea and acoustic amplification to 
the low frequency regions for candidates with residual low frequency 
hearing sensitivity. The combination of acoustic (hearing aid) and electrical 
stimu lation to the same ear is made possible through the external 
SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS Processor working in conjunction with the internal 
CI.  Patients without residual acoustic hearing can use the 
SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS Processor to provide electric stimulation; i n these 
cases the patient does not wear the hearing aid component.  
 
The SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS Audio Processor is programmed with the 
MED -EL MAESTRO System Software  used as part of typi[INVESTIGATOR_604504] .

  5 2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
As CI candidacy continues to expand, The Children’s Cochlear Implant Center at UNC has seen evidence 
of postoperative hearing preservation in pediatric CI recipi[INVESTIGATOR_604505]. Currently, only one manufacturer, Cochlear Americas, offers an FDA approved speech 
processor that allows us to take advantage of this functional hearing and use it to provide additional 
temporal cues. This external speech processor only works with internal  devices from Cochlear Americas. 
MED -EL also has an approved speech p rocessor, but it is currently only labeled for adult use, despi[INVESTIGATOR_604506].  The Cochlear Americas external speech processor requires use of a 
Receiver in the Canal (RIC) which is easy for children to damage and does not fit in smaller ears. The 
MED -EL SONNET /SONNET [ADDRESS_800590] like a 
behind -the-ear hearing aid. An earmold can be made to fit many shapes and sizes of ear canals, and it is 
made from vinyl or silicone so it is comf ortable.  
 
The primary aim of this study is to investigate speech perception performance with EAS in pediatric CI 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_604507].  While hearing preservation rates are good in our 
clinic, they are not guaranteed. Children with progressive hearing loss may continue to lose hearing , 
even if they maintain some residual hearing immediately after surgery. As a secondary aim, we intend to 
investigate outcomes in children who do not maintain residual hearing and are fit with traditional CI 
programming methods. Children with more residual hearing are being implanted, and this study design 
allows us to validate outcomes in both populations.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
Low-frequency acoustic hearing provides better temporal and spectral cues than low -frequency 
electrical stimulation (Dunn et al, 2010; Gifford et al, 2010; Incerti et al, 2013). These are cues that allow 
for localization, music appreciation, hearing in noi se, and prosodic recognition.  Preservation of residual 
hearing is of continuing clinical interest in cochlear implantation (Adunka et al, 2013; Adunka, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_552355], 
& Buchman, 2010; Carlson et al, 2011; Havenith et al, 2014; Santa Maria, Gluth, Yuan, Atlas,  & Blevins, 
2014;  Van Avel et al, 2015). Modified electrode arrays and surgical techniques have resulted in 
postoperative hearing preservation (Adunka et al, 2014; Adunka, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_552355], & Buchman, 2010; Anagiotos 
et al 2015; Carlson et al, 2011; Frixon, Kobler, & Rask -Anderson , 2012; Havenith et al, 2013; Kisser et al, 
2016; Santa Maria et al, 2013; Santa Maria et al, 2014; Skarzynski et al, 2014; Sweeney et al, 2016; Tamir 
et al, 2012; Yao, Turner & Gantz, 2006).  When low -frequency hearing is preserved, there  is an 
opportunity to provide high frequency hearing through electric stimulation and low -frequency cues 
through acoustic hearing.  
 
Research with adult CI recipi[INVESTIGATOR_604508], known as electric -acoustic stimulation (EAS), over fully acoustic or electric 
stimulation (Adunka, et al, 2013; Dillon, et al, 2014;  Gfeller, et al, 2007;  Gifford, et al, 2013;  Gifford, 
Dorman, & Brown, 2010; Helbig & Baumann, 2010; Incerti, Ching, & Cowan, 2014; Roland, et al, 2015; 
Sheffield, Jahn, & Gifford, 2015). In EAS modes of hearing, frequencies with residual hearing i n the 
implant ear are amplified using acoustic technology, and frequencies that cannot be sufficiently 
amplified are stimulated through traditional CI technology.  There are now commercially available 
external speech processors that combine these two technologies in one device.   
 
Outcomes in Children with Cochlear Implants and Pre -Operative Residual Hearing  V.1.[ADDRESS_800591] poor spectral resolution due to limited neural survival rates and limitations 
of electrical stimulation.  The addition of acoustic stimulation is thought to increase spectral resolution, 
thereby [CONTACT_604530], particularly in noise (Gifford & Dorman, 2012).  
 
As of yet, there are few peer reviewed studies that investigate EAS in the pediatric population  and all 
reports are on small groups of children . Wolfe, et al (2017) report on a cohort of [ADDRESS_800592] 6 
months  before being fit with the EAS speech processor.  In the second study, Scholz et al (2017) al so 
report on a small group of 6 children (9 ears) aged 6 -10 years who had worn full electric programs for an 
average of 5.9 years before being fit with EAS processors.  Contrary to Wolfe et al, no significant 
difference was found between the EAS and electr ic conditions. Skarzynski et al (2007) present on 6 
children, some of whom had CI -alone experience and some who did not. An improvement in speech 
perception was noted over preoperative scores.  Skarzynski and Lorens (2010) again show benefit of EAS 
in chil dren over traditional hearing aids, but neither of these papers compare EAS outcomes to CI -alone 
listening. No peer reviewed studies exist that investigate the use of EAS in children when they are fit 
with the device from initial stimulation.   
 
In reviewing our patient database, 81% of children who had stable hearing thresholds pre-operatively 
and a LFPTA  of 65 dB or better maintained  functional hearing for more than a year after surgery  
(n=17/21) . Of those patients, 100% of patients implanted with the MED -EL SYNCHRONY Cochlear 
Implant with FLEX24 electrode array had residual hearing at [ADDRESS_800593] -op. Across all patients 
included in this review, t he mean change in LFPTA   was 14 dB  HL. For children with progressive hearing 
loss pre -operatively, only 36% had functional hearing more than a year after surgery  (n=18/50) . The 
mean change in this group was 36 dB  HL; not surprising given the already progressive nature of the loss.   
 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_604509]  [ADDRESS_800594] scores were 
significantly better (p <0.001) for EAS programs (M ean=63.5 0%) than CI alone (M ean=44.63 %). This held 
true  for sentences  in noise as well (P<0.001) with a mean EAS score of 70.74% and a mean CI alone score 
of 53.94%.  For children who were recently implanted, we were able to compar e outcomes to pre -
operative scores .  CNC word scores with a hearing aid (M=26.25%) were poorer than those in a CI -alone 
condition (M ean=38.00%), but this did not reach statistical significance. The EAS Condition 
(Mean=63.00%) was significantly higher than both the pre -operative hearing aid condition (p<0.01) and 
the CI alone condition (p<0.01). There may have been learning effects as the subjects were typi[INVESTIGATOR_604510] -alone condition. We did not look at outcomes in children who lost residual 
hearing in this pi[CONTACT_158793], but according to our database, children who had preoperative residual 
hearing and do not have enough hearing to be fit with EAS technology have an average CNC word score  
of 61.76% . The pre -operative CNC scores in this group are similar to the pi[CONTACT_158793] (M=25.21%)  This 
leads us to  believe that our pi[INVESTIGATOR_604511] -alone condition before 
testing.  
The Children’s Cochlear Implant Center at UNC offers three different device manufacturers for children 
who are receiving a cochlear implant and have sufficient acoustic hearing  to confer a functional benefit . 
The decision on which device to implant is left up to the family, unless the surgeon has a preference 
based on anatomy. Families choosing MED -EL will receive the same internal and external device 
Outcomes in Children with Cochlear Implants and Pre -Operative Residual Hearing  V.1.6 
3 Dec 2019  
  7 regardless of whether or not they choose to participate in the study. The SYNCHRONY Implant is not 
experimental. The SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS processor (external hardware) is considered experimental in 
children. Following implantation, we will approach families of children implanted with the MED -EL 
device for inclusion  in the current study.  
All potential subjects in this study will have residual hearing prior to implantation. Participants will be 
enrolled following surgery in two Arms. The first Arm will be for those subjects who have enough 
residual hearing to fit with an EAS method. For the purposes of this study, we are defining functional 
hearing as a LFPTA of [ADDRESS_800595] enoug h residual 
hearing to amplify following implantation . These patients will be fitted with the same hardware as those 
in Arm 1, with the exception that they will not wear the hearing  aid (HA) component . Having two arms 
will allow us to compare groups with similar pre -operative hearing and investigate differences in 
listening in full electric and EAS conditions. Subjects in Arm [ADDRESS_800596] with residual hearing would 
be enrolled in Arm 1 and subsequently lose hearing; in these cases they would be removed from Arm 1 
and reassigned to Arm 2.

2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS  
• Poor sound quality from the device  
o All of the co -investigators are licensed audiologists with significant experience fitting 
EAS devices on children. Best practices will be followed to optimize sound quality. 
Subject feedback will be taken into account during programming.  
• Poorer speech perception and/or quality of life with the CI -alone and/or EAS  
o Should a subject find that their speech understanding  or quality of life is poorer with 
the device, they are welcome to withdraw from the study at any time.  
o The SONNET /SONNET [ADDRESS_800597].  
• Embarrassment with device use due to device visibility to others  
o Every effort will be made to mitigate cosmetic concerns.  
o There are a variety of earmold possibilities that are less conspi[INVESTIGATOR_604512].  
o This risk is highly unlikely as potential subjects will have been wearing hearing aids up 
until the time of cochlear implantation.  
• Loss of residual hearing in the implanted ear  
o This is a known risk to cochlear implantation and not increased with  the EAS device.  
o Those with progressive hearing loss may have a continuation of that course and lose 
hearing over the course of the study.  
• Pain and/or discomfort from the fit of the earmold and/or the placement of the audio 
processor and/or coil/magnet  
o There are a variety of earmolds and magnet strengths that can be used to reduce or 
eliminate pain/discomfort.  
o Every effort will be made to reduce discomfort through alternate fitting methods 
(headbands, moleskin, etc) . 
• Facial stimulation from device use  
o This is a known risk to cochlear implantation and not related to the EAS device itself.  
o Facial stimulation can typi[INVESTIGATOR_604513].  
• Dizziness from CI use  
o This is a known risk to cochlear implantation and not related to the EAS device itself.  
o Dizziness can typi[INVESTIGATOR_604514].  
• External equipment malfunction due to intermittencies in the device (i.e. cable needing to be 
replaced)  
o Subjects will be counseled extensively on how to troubleshoot equipment.  
o All subjects receive two speech processors at the time of implantation, ensuring that 
they have backup equipment and can have access to sound at all times.

3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ENDPOINT S 
Primary    
1. To determine if listening with 
electric -acoustic stimulation 
(EAS) provides improved speech 
understanding  over listening 
with the CI alone (CI -alone) in 
pediatric CI recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  1. Mean  CNC word scores, 
comparing EAS and CI -alone 
conditions at [ADDRESS_800599] 
stimulation  (Arm 1 to Arm 2) . 
2. Mean BKB -SIN scores, comparing 
EAS and CI -alone conditions at [ADDRESS_800600] stimulation  (Arm 1 to 
Arm 2) . The CNC word list is 
established as a 
standard test of speech 
perception outcomes. 
The BKB -SIN evaluates 
speech perception in 
multi -talker babble. 
Testing in multi -talke r 
babble is an effective 
way to evaluate 
differences in listening 
conditions with and 
without acoustic 
stimulation. Both of 
these tests are 
routinely given pre -
operatively  as part of 
candidacy 
determination . We will 
obtain and use these 
pre-operative scores in 
our analysis.  
Secondary    
1. To compare the pre -operative 
speech perception and quality of 
life scores with traditional 
hearing aids to post -operative

have implications for 
language development.  
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
Randomization:  
This is a non -randomized trial. Participants will fall into one of two arms:  
• Arm1. Subjects who receive a CI and present with a post -operative LFPTA  of < 75 dB HL . 
• Arm 2. Subjects with pre -operative low frequency hearing who receive a CI and present with  a 
post -operative LFPTA  of > 75 dB HL . 
Hypothes es:  
 
1. Subjects  will experience an improvement in speech perception in quiet, speech understanding in 
noise, and identification of prosodic features when listening with EAS as compared to listening 
to the CI -alone.  
2. Subjects  will experience an improvement in speech perception in quiet, speech understanding in 
noise, articulation, language, and quality of life after [ADDRESS_800604] scheduled procedure shown in the S chedule of Activities (SoA), 
Section 1.[ADDRESS_800605] visit or proc edure shown in the SoA in the trial 
globally.

5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
 
There will be no lifestyle restrictions during the course of this study.  
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants , to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to 
queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
 
Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of oral 
motor delays or behavioral concerns  may be rescreened. Rescreened participants should be assigned 
the same participant number as for the initial scr eening.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
Potential subjects will be identified during the  evaluation process for cochlear implantation at the 
Children's Cochlear Implant Center at UNC. Potential candidates may be recruited by [CONTACT_604531]/or 
clinical audiologists o n the CI team and/or their implanting physician . Only those who have chosen a 
MED -EL device will be approached for inclusion.  
To offset the time and travel commitment for participation , MED -EL Corporation will provide earmolds 
and subject compensation cards during the course of the study. The SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS devices 
themselves are provided as part of the internal device package prior to enrollment.

  13 6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
 
The MED -EL EAS System is intended to provide electric stimulation to the mid - to high -frequency region 
of the cochlea and acoustic amplification to the low frequency regions for candidates with residual low 
frequency hearing sensitivity. The combination of acoustic (hearing aid) and electrical stimulation to the 
same ear is made possible through the external SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS Processor working in 
conjunction with the internal CI.  
 
The MED -EL EAS System is not currently approved or cleared by [CONTACT_604532]. It is limited to investigational use for the purposes of this study.  All subjects will be fit with 
the SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS external audio processor . It is provided as part of the overall device kit prior 
to enrollment. There is an option to fit with or without the acoustic output. Subjects in Arm 1 with be fit 
with the acoustic output and a traditional earmold. Those in Arm 2 will be fit without the a coustic 
output.

6.3 ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
The MED -EL SONNET /SONNET 2  EAS is routinely fit off -label in our practice and can be ordered as part 
of the initial stimulation kit. These kits are ordered at the time of surgery, prior to enrollment. 
Registration of these devices is kept as part of the medical file. The specific device serial numbers will be 
kept in the regulatory binder as well.  
 
7 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
Subjects in Arm [ADDRESS_800621] loses residual hearing and no longer falls within 
the inclusion criteria , they will remain enrolled in the study, but will be shifted to Arm 2.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non-compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE) or other medical condition or situation occurs such that 
continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• If the participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be  recorded . Subjects who 
sign the informed consent form and are assigned  but do not receive the study intervention may be 
replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are assigned  and receive the study 
intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the study, will be 
replaced.  
Outcomes in Children with Cochlear Implants and Pre -Operative Residual Hearing  V.1.[ADDRESS_800622] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_62541] 3 working 
days  and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule 
and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These 
contact [CONTACT_13140]’ s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
 
BKB-SIN: The BKB -SIN is a speech -in noise te st that uses the BKB (Bamford -Kowal -Bench) sentences, 
recorded in four -talker babble.  The BKB -SIN is quick and easy to administer and score, contains age -
related norms for children, is suitable for CI users, and is less susceptible to ceiling effects.  
 
CNC : A standardized word list comprised of 50 words with consonant -vowel -consonant construction ie, 
Consonant -Nucleus -Consonant (CNC) words (Peterson & Lehiste, 1962).  The CNC test assesses 
perception of monosyllabic words. The test includes [ADDRESS_800623] “ready.”  
 
Desired Sensation Level (DSL):  The DSL Method was originally developed to provide audiologists with a 
systematic, science -based approach to pediatric hearing instrument fitting that ensures audibility of

language) and expressive (use of language) language for children and young adults aged [ADDRESS_800625] deviation of 15.  
 
Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) : (Gatehouse & Noble, 2004). The SSQ 
questionnaire assesses performance in three domains, hearing speech in quiet and noise environments 
(9 items), spatial or directional hearing (5 items) and sound qualities (8 items), which address sound 
segregation and l istening effort. Each item is rated on a 10 -point scale. Domain scores represent an 
average of item ratings. There is a version for children that  will be used  for this study .

8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
Anticipated Events:  those events described as potential risks in the protocol.  
 
Unanticipated Events:  Events n ot reported as potential risks.  
 
8.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
 
Unanticipated serious adverse events are defined as any serious adverse event related to the health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that event, 
problem, or death that was not previously defined  in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
literature or investigational plan. It can also include any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of participants.  
 
Serious Adverse Event: Serious injury means an injury or illness that: 1) is life -threatening, 2) results in 
permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or 3) necessitates 
medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment to a body function or permanent 
damage to a body structure.  
 
Permanent means an irreversible impairment or damage to a body structure or function, excluding 
trivial impairment or damage.  
 
8.2.3  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
All adverse events will be recorded and tracked using an Adverse Event Report Form.  These forms will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_456]/ PI [INVESTIGATOR_604517] . Frequent adverse 
events will be discussed with co -investigators.  
 
Anticipated events will be reported to the IRB in the annual report . 
Outcomes in Children with Cochlear Implants and Pre -Operative Residual Hearing  V.1.6 
3 Dec 2019  
  25  
Unanticipated events will be reported to the IRB within 10 days of the investigator becoming aware of 
the event.  
 
8.2.4  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
The study investigator shall complete  a Serious  Adverse  Event  Form and submit to the study sponsor /PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_604518] ( IRB) as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_800626].  The study sponsor /PI [INVESTIGATOR_604519] 10 working days after the sponsor /PI [INVESTIGATOR_604520] e ffect. 
Thereafter , the sponsor shall submit such additional reports concern ing the effect as the IRB requests.  
 
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be 
chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by 
[CONTACT_4530] /PI [INVESTIGATOR_604521].  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
9.1 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
• A power calculation utilizing CNC scores obtained from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_604522] a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_800627] 90% power. A sample size of 20 
participants per arm was selected due to known variability in pediatric CI recipi[INVESTIGATOR_604523] 1 to Arm 2. Sample size was 
calculated via G*Power [IP_ADDRESS] and the following assumptions were made:  
o Paired t -tests  
o One-sided 0.05 alpha levels  
o Desire for 90% power  
o Assumed distribution (mean, standard deviation) based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] . 
9.2 STATISTICAL PLAN  
 
• Descriptive summaries will be provided for the following:  
o Participant demographics  
o Frequency of major and minor complications/adverse events.  
• A single -subject design will be utilized, where each participant serves as his or her own control, 
for analysis of objective and subjective results. A single -subject design was chosen in order to 
accommodate the heterogeneity that is well known to characte rize auditory prosthesis 
research.  
• Considering the possibility of subjects moving from Arm 1 to Arm 2, mixed -design  ANOVA will be 
calculated with a p -value of ≤ 0.05 for statistical significance.  
• Effect sizes and confidence intervals of 95% will be calculated and reported for primary 
endpoints.  
Outcomes in Children with Cochlear Implants and Pre -Operative Residual Hearing  V.1.6

  26 • Normality will be evaluated based on visual inspection of the data and using Kolmogorov -
Smirnov test.  These steps will be used prior to all statistical analyses at the 12 -month endpoint .. 
• Bonferroni corrections for multiple tests (n=2) will be applied to analyses of the primary 
endpoints.  
• Statistical analysis will be conducted with SPSS software.  
• The following measures will be analyzed:  
o Comparison of CNC scores between conditions and groups.  
o The distributions of CNC word scores will be evaluated for assumptions of normality.  
Depending on the outcome, comparisons will be made with paired t -test or Mann -
Whitney test.  Comparison of BKB -SIN scores between conditions and groups.  
▪ The SNR -[ADDRESS_800628] materials.  It is an estimate of the signal -to-noise ratio associated with 50% 
correct based on word -level scoring.  
▪ Distributions will be evaluated for assumptions of normality.  Depending on the 
outcome, comparisons will be made with paired t -test or Mann -Whitney test.  
o Comparison of Pediatric SSQ  subjective report scores in the pre - and post -initial 
activation intervals.   
o The distributions Pediatric SSQ  scores will be evaluated for assumptions of normality.  
Depending on the outcome, comparisons will be made with paired t -test or Wilcoxon 
Signed Rank  test.  Comparison of pre - and post -operative speech and language scores 
(OWLS II and GFTA) between groups.  
▪ The distributions of articulation and language scores will be evaluated for 
assumptions of normality.  Depending on the outcome, comparisons will be 
made with paired t -test or Mann -Whitney test.  
o Comparison of prosodic discrimination abilities between conditions and groups.  
• If needed, statistical consultation will be sought from the North Carolina Translational and 
Clinical Sciences Institute (TraCS) or UNC Odum Institute.

[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS   
 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant ’s parent(s)/guardian(s)  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to 
starting intervention.   Assent forms will be given to subjects over the age of 7.  Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_604524].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Consent and assent forms will be 
Outcomes in Children with Cochlear Implants and Pre -Operative Residual Hearing  V.1.[ADDRESS_800629] ( IRB)-approved , and the participant  will be asked to read and review the 
document. The investigator will explain the research study to the participant  and family and answer any 
questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  participant’s 
comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as 
research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent and 
assent form s and ask questions prior to signing.  The participant s should have the opportunity to discuss 
the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The 
participant  will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for 
the study.  Participant s must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw 
from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the informed consent document and assent 
form will be given to the participant s’ guardian  for their records. The informed consent process will be 
conducted and  documented in the source  document (including the date), and the form signed, before 
the participan t undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights and welfare of the participant s will 
be protected by [CONTACT_604534] e to participate i n this study. Communication will occur in a closed -door room at the 
Children’s Cochlear Implant Center and/or the Clinical Research Lab at the Children’s Cochlear Implant 
Center.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_800630] ( IRB), regulatory agencies , or the manufacturer  may 
inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093]. The clinical study site 
will permit access to such records.  When data is pulled from the database for analysis, no identifying 
information will be kept with the data.  
 
Upon enrollment, all subjects will be assigned an anonymous subject ID.  The subject ID will be stored in 
a password protected FileMaker database housed on a UNC server. This will be linked to the subject’s 
name, but this information is only viewable by [CONTACT_604535]. The study coordinator will enter all of 
the subject’s demographic  information and test results  into this database. All personal identifiers will be 
kept separate from the study data.  
 
Subject specific binders will be maintained in a locked cabinet in the Children’s Cochlear Implant Center. 
Individual data collection sheets will be coded with the subject number, and placed in the subject 
specific binder at each interval.  
 
10.1.3  QUALITY CONTROL  
 
We will  perform internal quality management of documentation and completion.  An individualized 
quality management plan will be developed.  
 
Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC 
checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be 
communicated with the investigator  for clarification/resolution.

[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
Subjects will be assigned a specific alpha -numeric participation code upon enrollment. The linkage file 
for that code will be stored in a password protected, customized FileMaker database secured on UNC 
servers. Only co -investigators will have access to this file.  
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff under the supervision of the PI. Each  
investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported .  All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data.   
 
The data will be recorded on Case Report Forms (CRFs) in patient -specific binders on a case -by [CONTACT_604536]. CRFs and source documents will not contain identifiable information. 
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_604525] .  Data recorded 
on Case Report Forms should be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents . The study 
coordinator will verify consistency. Subject binders will be stored in a locked cabinet at The Children’s 
Cochlear Implant Center at UNC.  
 
Clinical data (including adverse events ( AEs) ) will be entered into  the FileMaker database . Only co -
investigators will have access to this data. The data system includes password protection and internal 
quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. A customized database will be used for this study. Only subject IDs will be used when 
entering data. Clinical data will be entered directly from the CRFs . 
 
The co -investigators will be responsible for data entry and for cross checking dat a for accuracy.   At the 
time of data analysis  the data will be exported by [CONTACT_604537].    Any use of the data outside of the database will employ the subject ID  and will not 
include personal identifiers  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
After the closure of the study, subject data will be retained for seven years. At that time, paper data will 
be shredded and destroyed in a HIPAA compliant manner. Electronic data will be destroyed following 
UNC policy.  
 
10.1.5  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice ( ICH GCP) , or Manual of Procedures ( MOP) requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant , the investigator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1

  30 V1.6  12/3/2019  Added SONNET 2 EAS as a device. 
Removed Maestro 7 as a device and 
changed to simply include the 
Maestro System.  SONNET 2 EAS has been FDA 
approved and will be arriving in 
patient kits. It is an updated 
version of the SONNET EAS 
device. Maestro 7 is no longer 
considered experimental and 
we will be using the FDA 
approved versions of the 
software from this point on as 
they now provide what we 
need to fit the EAS devices.  
V1.7  5/18/2020  Removing Leiter -R from protocol and 
changing exclusion criteria to read 
“known or suspected cognitive 
impairment.”  
 
Changing screening procedures . The Leiter -R has proven to be 
an unnecessary and 
cumbersome measure. For 
safety measures in light of 
COVID -19 it is being removed as 
a screening tool.  
 
To ease scheduling difficulties 
in light of COVID -19, 
investigators may reach out to 
potential candidates prior to 
initial stimulation to discuss the 
study and schedule initial 
stimulation visits appropriately.

Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/2022   I. BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE  A. Historical Background  Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, but 25% of surgical patients do not achieve long-term weight loss maintenance.1–3 Obesity affects more than 30% of U.S. adults and has been deemed a major public health issue, costing more than $[ADDRESS_1127823]-effective, sustained weight loss.2,3,6,7 Remission of weight-related comorbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol) is associated with weight loss, so weight loss maintenance is vital for preserving these improvements in health.2 However, 25% of MBS patients do not maintain the expected weight loss.1–3,8,[ADDRESS_1127824]-MBS patients because of their increased risk of weight-related disease.10–[ADDRESS_1127825]-MBS patients are recommended to engage in 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and even higher levels may be needed to control weight.14–17 Unfortunately, 89-97% of post-MBS patients do not meet this recommendation.18–20 MBS clinics typi[INVESTIGATOR_814780], and while dietary adherence is critical to the success of MBS patients, low physical activity is independently linked to medical sequelae. Increasing physical activity, even without weight change, can improve insulin sensitivity, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], blood pressure, and blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], all of which confer a lower risk for cardiac and/or metabolic disease.21–24 Behavioral interventions to improve physical activity after MBS show promise, but the evidence is still limited by a lack of trials that are well-powered with long-term follow-up.25–[ADDRESS_1127826] struggled with attendance, with common barriers including living long distances from the clinic and lack of time off from work.28–[ADDRESS_1127827] not been examined thoroughly in MBS patients.35–[ADDRESS_1127828] by [CONTACT_814792].39–[ADDRESS_1127829] during, but not after, physical activity predicted increased future physical activity, supporting the “upward spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585]” theory of lifestyle change.44,[ADDRESS_1127830] of a health behavior, nonconscious motives increase one’s likelihood of repeating that behavior. Over time, health behaviors become reinforcing rather than burdensome. However, sedentary women with obesity have been found to experience lower pleasure during physical activity compared to sedentary lean and overweight women.46 MBS patients may be missing out on this “upward spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585]” due to emotional barriers to physical activity, such as feeling too overweight, shame about 
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/[ADDRESS_1127831] during physical activity.  Positive psychology (PP) interventions target positive emotions and may be particularly effective for increasing physical activity in post-MBS patients. PP programs use structured tasks, such as imagining an ideal future, expressing gratitude, or using personal strengths, to increase the frequency and intensity of positive psychological states (e.g., optimism, positive affect, gratitude). A meta-analysis of [ADDRESS_1127832] also been shown to improve physical activity in patients with cardiometabolic disease.51–[ADDRESS_1127833] during physical activity engagement.44,54 However, PP may be particularly effective in combination with an adherence-based program such as motivational interviewing (MI).55   Motivational interviewing (MI) may enhance the effects of PP in post-MBS patients. [CONTACT_102974]’s group developed a combined positive psychology-motivational interviewing (PP-MI) intervention to improve health behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and heart failure with promising findings from pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (3.1a).52,53,[ADDRESS_1127834] size has been small to moderate when used alone in medical populations.58 Because low optimism and depressive symptoms are associated with poor outcomes with MI,59–[ADDRESS_1127835]-MBS patients that involved semi-structured individual interviews asking about participants’ experiences with physical activity before and after surgery, their barriers and facilitators to activity, the types of emotions they experience in relation to physical activity, and their ideas and preferences about the planned intervention.[ADDRESS_1127836] informed the adaptation of PP-MI for this population.  
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/2022   C. Rationale/Potential Benefits/Overview of Proposed Research  Given: (a) the relationship between psychological well-being and health behavior adherence, (b) the preliminary efficacy of PP-MI interventions in other populations, and (c) the identified emotional barriers to adherence specific to the post-MBS population, this intervention, customized to apply to the unique experiences of post-MBS patients, has the potential to increase physical activity and reduce adverse events in a high-risk, high-yield population of patients. This would have direct benefits to patients and would impact public health, given that nonadherence to health behaviors is a major public health problem among patients with obesity.   II. SPECIFIC AIMS  We will conduct a one-arm proof-of-concept trial to refine the newly adapted intervention and study procedures.   Specific Aim 1: To pi[INVESTIGATOR_814781]-MBS PP-MI intervention with exit interviews for further refinement (N=10).  Hypothesis: We will recruit [ADDRESS_1127837] feedback from them that will aid in study refinement.   III. PARTICIPANT SELECTION  A. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria: Participants eligible for this study must meet the following criteria: 1. Adult (age 18+) 2. History of MBS (gastric by[CONTACT_317771]) at MGH or BWH 6-12 months prior to study enrollment. *Note: because there have been fewer surgeries than usual in the past year due to the Covid-[ADDRESS_1127838] difficulty recruiting sufficient numbers. 3. Low physical activity, defined as <200 minutes/week self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form,69 plus a desire to increase physical activity.  4. Access to telephone for study sessions 5. Able to read and speak English  Exclusion criteria: Participants will be excluded if they have: 1. Cognitive deficits precluding participation or informed consent, assessed using a six-item screen70 designed to assess suitability for research participation.   2. Illness likely to lead to death in the next 6 months per chart review 3. Inability to be physically active (e.g., severe arthritis) 4. Participation in another program targeting physical activity besides the standard offerings at the surgery center. 5. Severe psychiatric conditions expected to interfere with study participation, as determined by [CONTACT_14716] (e.g., recent psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], active substance use disorder, psychosis).  
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/[ADDRESS_1127839] and/or paper mail. The research invitation will describe the study, the procedure to opt out of further contact, and whom to call for further information. These letters will be sent from a central location at MGH. Should study staff receive no reply within two weeks, staff members will call the patient on the phone to assess interest in the study and to describe the study over the phone. If the patient remains interested, staff will confirm eligibility and assess for exclusion criteria. If the patient remains interested and appears eligible, study staff will schedule an initial study visit at the MGH TCRC to complete the consent procedures and conduct the initial study visit. We will then mail or e-mail participants a consent form to look over ahead of time, so that they may prepare questions for the first visit. We will follow the MGB IRB guidelines around email contact, specifically that we will send all emails via an encrypted, SEND SECURE system, or that we will send them in a non-encrypted manner but only with the person’s approval and understanding of the risks associated with non-encrypted email (i.e., that there could be loss of confidentiality).    In addition, referral by [CONTACT_814793]’ surgery center will be encouraged. For directly referred patients, we will send opt-out letters as above. Finally, we may use hospi[INVESTIGATOR_814782].   IV. PARTICIPANT ENROLLMENT   A. Methods of Enrollment Study staff will assess eligibility via phone interview/record review. Patients who are eligible after the phone screen and still interested in participating will attend a baseline in-person visit at which time informed consent will be obtained by a trained study staff member (PI [INVESTIGATOR_352123]; see below for details) and their baseline assessment will occur.   B. Procedures for obtaining informed consent If patients, as identified above, meet study criteria and remain interested in the study, the coordinator or other study staff will mail or send an electronic copy of the IRB-approved consent form for patient review, and will schedule an in-person visit at MGH. We will follow the MGB IRB guidelines around email contact, specifically that we will send all emails via an encrypted, SEND SECURE system, or that we will send them in a non-encrypted manner but only with the person’s approval and understanding of the risks associated with non-encrypted email (i.e., that there could be loss of confidentiality).  This will be discussed as part of the phone screen. This will allow patients to have adequate time to read the consent form. Informed consent will be obtained in person at MGH during the initial baseline visit by a trained study staff member (PI [INVESTIGATOR_352123]. Before collecting any data, the study coordinator will review the consent form during the study visit and will allow the patient to ask any questions he or she may have; the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_782429]. To ensure that participants have the capacity to provide informed consent, we will ask potential participants to describe their 
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/2022  understanding of the study’s purpose and their role. They will also be asked for their permission to be contact[CONTACT_782452]. We will not exclude patients on the basis of race, ethnicity, or gender.  C. Treatment assignment/randomization  Proof-of-concept trial: For the initial trial, all participants will receive the PP-MI intervention and there will be no randomization.  V. STUDY PROCEDURES A. Study visits and parameters to be measured  Enrollment/Baseline Assessment (Visit #1): Patients who are interested in participating in the study and are eligible per the phone screen will come to the MGH TCRC for their initial study visit. At this time, informed consent will be obtained by a trained study staff member (PI [INVESTIGATOR_352123]). After providing informed consent, participants will provide demographic and medical information (e.g., medical comorbidities, weight history) and complete self-report measures to assist in characterization of the sample.  Furthermore, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body composition, and blood pressure will be obtained, and 5 mL of blood will be drawn for measurement of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], A1C, and CRP. We will also ask participants to report their weight at home the next day, for consistency. We also will perform a six-minute walk test76 (6MWT) to assess functional exercise capacity. Finally, we will provide participants with an Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer,77  which they will be asked to wear for 7 days (minimum acceptable use is 4+ days with 10+ hours of recorded data). Participants will be given the option to complete Visit [ADDRESS_1127840] visit.   Intervention Introduction (Visit #2; In person): This visit will take place approximately 1 week after Visit #1. Participants will return their accelerometer and study staff will check for sufficient wear time. If wear time is insufficient, the participant will be asked to wear it for another week and delay their Visit #2. If there is sufficient wear time participants will next be provided with a Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] 2 to track activity. They will set up the Fitbit with the research coordinator, using a study-provided login so that the study staff can access participants’ Fitbit data during the study. After the study ends, participants will keep the Fitbit and will be instructed to change the account to a private one for ongoing personal use. They will then meet with the study interventionist for an introduction to the PP-MI intervention. Participants will be remunerated $40 after this visit.   10-Week Follow-Up (Visit #3): After completion of the intervention, participants will wear the accelerometer for 7 days (the device will be mailed to them so they can start wearing it the day after their final intervention call). They will then return to the TCRC for another in-person assessment where they will return the accelerometer and repeat all measures done at Visit #1. At this time participants will also complete an exit interview with a staff member who has not been in contact [CONTACT_814794]. Participants will be remunerated $60.  
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/2022  For participants who withdraw prior to completing the intervention: In the event that a participant withdraws from the study prior to completing all [ADDRESS_1127841] with them previously. Participants will be remunerated $50 for this phone call.   B. Drugs to be used No drugs will be administered.  C. Devices to be used No medical devices will be used.  D. Procedures/surgical interventions, etc.  Intervention: Participants will receive a written treatment manual at Visit #2 that has detailed information about each session’s topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. The intervention consists of 10 weekly phone sessions (30-45 minutes each). Each session includes a combination of a new psychological skill designed to increase positive emotions experienced during physical activity, a motivational skill designed to boost physical activity, plus setting a physical activity goal for the next week using information from their Fitbit. The sessions will be structured such that they begin with a review of the past week’s activity (using Fitbit data plus any supplemental tracking) and determining whether the participant met their goal. The prior week’s physical activity and psychological topi[INVESTIGATOR_814783], with discussion of how they used these skills, the positive emotions they experienced, and how they can continue to integrate the skills. Next, the new topi[INVESTIGATOR_814784] a new physical activity goal for the upcoming week. A motivational interviewing approach will be used for all topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].

Data to be collected and when the data is to be collected Baseline characteristics: To allow us to better understand our study population, we will record subjects’ baseline characteristics (e.g. age, gender, race/ethnicity) during their initial visit.   Feasibility and acceptability: We will ask participants receiving PP-MI to rate each topic on ease and usefulness on a scale from 0-10 (0=not at all easy/helpful, 10=very easy/helpful). We will also collect exit interview data from proof-of-concept trial participants to get more detail about what they liked or did not like about the study overall and any suggestions they have for improvement.   Self-report measures: These will be collected at baseline and 10 weeks. • Optimism: Life Orientation Test – Revised (LOT-R)79 • Depression and Anxiety: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)80 • Motivation (stage of change): University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA)81 • Self-Efficacy (general and exercise-specific): General Self-Efficacy Scale82 and Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale83 • Internalized Weight Bias: Weight Bias Internalization Scale – Modified (WBIS-M)84 • Exercise Identity: Exercise Identity Scale (EIS)85 • MBS-specific Diet and Vitamin Adherence: Bariatric Surgery Self-Management Questionnaire86 • Physical Activity and sedentary time (self-reported): International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)69 • Household Members Survey • Social Support and Eating Habits Survey87 • Social Support and Exercise Survey87  Objectively-measured physical activity: These measures will be collected at baseline and 10 weeks using the Actigraph GT3X-BT. • Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in met-minutes/week and mean minutes/week • Light physical activity in met-minutes/week and mean minutes/week • Steps in mean number/day • Sedentary time in mean minutes/day  Health-related measures: These will be assessed at baseline and 10 weeks. • Weight, height, body composition, and waist circumference, assessed by [CONTACT_814795]. Weight, height, and waist circumference will be measured and self-reported by [CONTACT_814796].  
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/2022  • Blood pressure (in mm Hg), assessed via MGH TCRC nurses using their protocol during in person visits. Blood pressure will not be collected during remote visits. • Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], A1C, and CRP via blood draw by [CONTACT_814797]. Phlebotomists at Quest Diagnostics Service Center will complete the labwork for remote visits.   • Six-minute walk test, assessed by [CONTACT_814798]. Six-minute walk test will not be completed during remote visits.   All participants will be asked to complete all measures at all time points, if possible. However, should a participant decline a certain measure or choose not to attend a follow-up visit, we collect as much data as possible from that person and proceed with all collected data. While we will try to avoid it, we expect there will be missing data in this study.  VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS A. Specific data variables being collected for the study  We will collect data from 12 participants in the proof-of-concept trial (assessments at baseline and 10 weeks plus weekly session ratings and exit interviews). Assessments will include the measures detailed above.  B. Study endpoints Proof-of-concept trial: the primary goal of this phase is to refine the intervention to a place where it is feasible and acceptable. We will aim to obtain follow-up data from at least [ADDRESS_1127844].  C. Statistical methods Proof-of-concept trial:   This small proof-of-concept trial is designed to test initial feasibility and acceptability of the newly developed intervention and to refine the intervention as needed.   Feasibility. Descriptive statistics will be used to calculate proportions to test feasibility, defined as % of sessions completed.   Acceptability will be measured with means and standard deviations of participants’ ratings of session ease and utility on a 0-10 scale (0 = very difficult/not at all useful, 10 = very easy/very useful). Cutoffs will not be used to determine feasibility and acceptability for this study as the sample is so small, and the goal of Aim [ADDRESS_1127845] size (Cohen’s d) of the within-subjects change in each outcome measure from baseline to [ADDRESS_1127846].   
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/2022  D. Power analysis (e.g., sample size, evaluable subjects, etc.) Proof-of-concept trial: We have not conducted a power analysis for this study because the primary aim is to establish and refine procedures, troubleshooting any unexpected problems. We anticipate a sample of N=[ADDRESS_1127847] blood at Visits #1 and #3. Risks of venous blood sampling include pain, bruising at the phlebotomy site, and emotional discomfort from the process. More rarely, participants may become lightheaded or experience syncope, or have an infection at the site. We will minimize these risks by [CONTACT_814799] (TCRC research protocol nurse) and have specific experience with this procedure. Procedurally, we will make sure participants are seated comfortably during and after the sampling, and we will temporarily (or permanently) halt blood draws if patients voice pain or discomfort. If participants experience problems after blood draws (e.g., concerns about infection), they will be able to reach a study physician at any time, who can help to assess the situation over the phone or arrange to have the participant seen by [CONTACT_782459].  B. Drug side effects and toxicities  No specific mediations are being studied or administered solely for research purposes in this study.  C. Device complications/malfunctions  We will be utilizing two devices that measure physical activity in this study: the Actigraph GT3X-BT accelerometer and the Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] 2 activity tracker. These devices pose minimal risk. The accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X-BT) used to measure activity is small, light, and without sharp edges. Immersing the device in water for a prolonged period may render it unusable but does not pose a shock risk. The Fitbit provided to participants for activity self-monitoring similarly poses minimal risk, given that it has no sharp edges, no potential to cause shocks, and no other known risks. We will educate participants about the use of both devices when providing the devices to them, and study staff will be available to troubleshoot any problems that arise during their use.  D. Psychosocial (non-medical) risks Confidentiality. To minimize confidentiality-related risks, we will use participant ID numbers—as opposed to identifiable personal data or medical record numbers—on all study documents. We will use locked cabinets and offices as well as password-protected databases to store personal information. Information from self-report assessments will be collected and stored using the secure, HIPPA-compliant, firewalled, and password-protected REDCap system. REDCap is a free web-based application developed for management of research and clinical data; it has separate password-protected data collection repositories for each trial. We have used this system for numerous prior studies without difficulty. Accelerometers will be labeled only with participant numbers; they will be connected to staff computers via USB, and staff will utilize the password-protected Actigraph software downloaded onto our local computers to 
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/[ADDRESS_1127848] that the study team provides, so that the study staff can access their physical activity information for the duration of the study. We will create this account together with them at Visit #2, to ensure that they do not enter identifying information (e.g., their name) into the account. When the study is over, participants will be instructed to change their username [CONTACT_814803].  Digital recordings of PP-MI sessions will be collected using portable recorders. Randomly-selected sessions will be reviewed for competence and adherence to the protocol by  [CONTACT_95205]’s behavioral intervention expert, using fidelity scales created for this intervention. All recordings will be downloaded immediately from the recorders and the electronic files will be kept within the firewalled, password-protected shared file area for fidelity review. Recordings will contain no personally identifiable information. We have used all of these methods to maintain confidentiality in prior projects using the same measures, data repository, accelerometers, and recorders.  We will ensure that contact [CONTACT_184378]-related messages for them unless expressly allowed by [CONTACT_4317]. Upon enrollment, we ask all participants if it is acceptable to leave voice messages on their phones, as well as the appropriate times to call them. We adhere to any and all patient requests regarding contact.    Physical activity safety. To ensure that patients can safely participate in physical activity,  we will confirm with the patient’s surgery center clinician (physician, nurse practitioner or psychologist) that the patient is able to participate in a physical activity promotion program prior to approaching the patient. We will describe to the clinician the plan for setting goals to increase physical activity, and will ask if there are any specific instructions or cautions to be conveyed to participants. This information will be recorded in the REDCap system so interventionists can use this information when developi[INVESTIGATOR_814785]. We will provide education to all participants about symptoms that could be concerning during activity (e.g., chest pain, dyspnea), including when to report symptoms to their primary care provider and when to present to the emergency room.    Depression/anxiety symptoms and suicidal ideation. Participants will complete the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) as part of assessments; although this is a symptom measure and is not used to make a diagnosis of depression, for participants with HADS depression subscale scores of 10 or more, the study PI ([CONTACT_814804]) will call the patient to assess for suicidality using the suicide item from the PHQ-9. For patients without active suicidal ideation, we will encourage them to discuss their symptoms with their primary care provider and/or surgery center psychologist. For participants who have active suicidal ideation or are otherwise considered to be at high risk (e.g., due to combinations of depression symptom severity, history of prior attempt, and passive suicidal ideation), the study PI ([CONTACT_814804]) will perform a separate assessment and will arrange for urgent evaluation (e.g., in an emergency department) if clinically indicated, with consultation from a study psychiatrist ([CONTACT_102974] or [CONTACT_814805]).   
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/[ADDRESS_1127849] experienced at any time throughout the study. Any adverse events will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_814786], and any events requiring immediate clinical follow-up will be addressed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_814787].  E. Radiation Risks  There will be no radiation exposure in this study.  VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS A. Potential benefits to participating individuals. All participants will receive serial assessments of medical, psychiatric, and functional status, allowing them access to emergent care if required. All participants will also receive our PP-MI intervention, which has shown to improve physical activity and psychological well-being in studies of other populations (type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome).   B. Potential benefits to society. Participation in physical activity (and other health behaviors) is crucial in preventing weight regain and onset of comorbidities for patients who have had MBS. Existing complex health behavior interventions can be difficult to implement in real-world settings, and more straightforward interventions, like MI, may require additional components to increase engagement and boost efficacy. By [CONTACT_782464], we will learn whether the PP-MI intervention is feasible and well-accepted by [CONTACT_447]-MBS patients who have low physical activity. We will also examine whether the intervention is associated with increased physical activity (objectively measured by [CONTACT_6317]), psychological well-being, and other outcomes in this cohort.             This knowledge could be of substantial importance. If the PP-MI intervention proves to be feasible, well-accepted, and effective in this study and larger follow-up studies, it may be possible to implement this easily-delivered program as part of a clinical care package for post-MBS patients who have low physical activity. This, in turn, could lead to better long-term weight loss outcomes after surgery, greater self-care, and fewer complications in a vulnerable population at high risk of complications and mortality. Therefore the knowledge gained from this initial study may ultimately translate to substantial benefit for future patients and public health.   IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE A. Independent monitoring of source data All source data (e.g., chart review data and participant self-report) will be entered into the REDCap database. At intervals throughout the study, the PI ([CONTACT_814804]) will review this data to ensure that it is being entered correctly and will perform ‘test downloads’ of the data to ensure that it can be captured in the statistical package to be used in this study.   B. Safety monitoring (e.g., Data Safety Monitoring Board, etc.) Safety monitoring will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Feig (PI), who will ensure that the study team is adequately identifying, reviewing, and reporting adverse events and unanticipated problems to the MGB Institutional Review Board (IRB). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_814788], including a summary of any data and safety monitoring issues that occurred since the previous reporting 
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/[ADDRESS_1127850]. Jeff Huffman (psychiatry, primary mentor), [CONTACT_814806] (psychology, co-mentor), and [CONTACT_814807] (internal medicine, co-mentor). Monitoring intervals. Monitoring of adverse events will occur on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_105092], based on information gathered from participants at assessment visits and weekly phone sessions. More systematic weekly meetings for review of feasibility/acceptability information and minor IRB deviations will be held between [CONTACT_814804] and study staff, including the lead research coordinator. [CONTACT_814804] will then discuss any potential issues regarding data safety or protocol deviations with mentor [CONTACT_102974] during weekly supervision meetings. This allows the team to review this information and make adjustments to procedures as required. Furthermore, journal clubs are held within the study team monthly. These include discussions of related projects and timely studies (e.g., studies of physical activity in related patient populations, studies of positive psychological interventions). These ongoing, weekly, and intermittent reviews ensure that the study procedures minimize research-related risk by [CONTACT_814800]. [CONTACT_814804] (study PI) is responsible for directly reporting any serious study-related adverse events to the NIH/NHLBI. If there are no such events, a yearly report summarizing adherence to the DSMP, review of study-related enrollment and issues during the study period, and any relevant changes to the protocol, will be sent to NHLBI. Information to be monitored. Information to be monitored will include: (a) an evaluation of the progress of the research study, including assessments of data quality and timeliness, and participant recruitment, accrual and retention consistent with plans for diversity and generalizability, (b) a review of study safety data—adverse event and minor deviation information—to determine whether the study should continue as originally designed, be changed, or be stopped, (c) review of procedures to maintain participant confidentiality (e.g., ensuring study databases have no personal identifying information, using study participant numbers on communications about the study), and (d) an assessment of external factors or relevant information (e.g., developments in the literature, results of related studies, etc.) that may have an impact on the safety of participants or on the ethics of the research study, such as through the journal club listed above.  C. Outcomes monitoring The research team will meet on a weekly basis to review study progress. The study team will also discuss any procedural difficulties, recruitment issues, randomization issues, and adverse events at this meeting (and before if needed). If there are consistent issues with the logistics, feasibility, or acceptability of the assessment visits or intervention calls (e.g., participant complaints about length of visits, frequent missed calls), we will review our methods and alter the study protocol as needed. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will not plan to perform interim analyses. However, we will review feasibility/acceptability ratings of phone sessions in an ongoing manner, and if they are consistently low for a certain topic during the proof-of-concept 
Gaining Optimism After weight Loss Surgery (GOALS): A positive psychology-based intervention to increase physical activity after bariatric surgery Emily Feig, PhD – Detailed Protocol 11/01/[ADDRESS_1127851] to reporting unanticipated problems, including adverse events. Specifically, when a serious or nonserious adverse event occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_782438]. For all unanticipated problems and unexpected adverse events deemed related or possibly related to the research, we will complete and submit an “Other Event report through Insight/eIRB” as soon as possible and within 5 working days/7 calendar days (as defined in the May 2017 Reporting Unanticipated Problems Including Adverse Events report). At Continuing Review, we will provide a summary of all unanticipated problems as per PHRC protocol. Finally, if there are unanticipated problems, especially if serious or recurrent, the PI ([CONTACT_814804]) will amend the protocol if it is deemed necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the participants.

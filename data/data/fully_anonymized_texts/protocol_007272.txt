Local/Central Laboratories and Reviewers
Data generated by [CONTACT_221751] a nd evaluations performed by [CONTACT_233263]’s efficacy results.
Laboratory tests that may result in dose inte rruption and/or modification as specified in Table [ADDRESS_281476] visits.
At a minimum the following hematology/chemistry assessments must be performed locally:  
hemoglobin, absolute lymphocyte count, ab solute neutrophil count and pl atelet count, 
potassium, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, to tal bilirubin, AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, and uric 
acid.  
At screening, subjects must meet eligibility criteria based on central lab results.  At Study Day 
1, subjects must meet eligibility criteria based on lo cal or central lab results prior to initiating 
study therapy, however, a re-calculation of creat inine clearance is not required at Study Day 1.

Subjects will complete quality of life questionnaire (FACT-Leu and EQ-5D questionnaires) at 
time points detailed in Table [ADDRESS_281477] centers.  Intensive sampling and sparse sampling will be discontinued as of this 
amendment, protocol amendment #6.
Treatment
Subjects must meet all eligibility criteria to be randomized for the study.
Initial randomization
Initially subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) in a double-blind fashion to the 5 mg, 10 mg, and 
15 mg starting dose arms (treatment arm 1, treatment arm 2, and treatment arm 3 respectively).  The randomization procedure will be accomplished by a validated interactive voice response 
system (IVRS).  Subjects will be stratified at randomization by (i) relapsed vs refractory to 
their last purine-analog or bendamustine based treatment reg imen (if subject has received both, 
the status post most recent purine-analog or bendamustine regimen will be used for 
stratification) and (ii) age < 65 years of age vs ∀65 years of age.  The subjects will receive 
lenalidomide once daily in a 28 day cycle and will be escalated every 28 days as tolerated in a 
stepwise manner up to a maximum of 25 mg daily.
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_233206](s)
After 18 subjects complete one 28 day cycle, an interim analysis will be conducted to review 
the safety of each starting dose arm(s).  Subsequent interim analyses to review the safety and progression rate of each starting dose arm(s) will o ccur at 13-week intervals.  After review of 
each interim analysis, a treatment arm may be dropped.  At any time accrual to a starting dose 
arm will also be stopped if unacceptable toxicities are observed in that arm.  If a treatment arm is dropped then all new subjects will be randomized equally into the remaining arm(s).

For toxicities requiring dose interrupt ion and/or modification see Section 10.2.3 . Note that a 
more gradual stepwise dose escalation of lenalidomide (more than one 28 day cycle for each 
dose level) might be needed at the discretion of the treating physician due to adverse events that do not require dose reduction or interruption.
Subjects unable to escalate to the [ADDRESS_281479] dose achieved in the previous cycle or as indicated in the dose modification section (see Section 10.2.3 ).
Study visits and serial measurements of safety and efficacy will be performed as outlined in 
Table 2 .  The severity of adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0 with 
the exceptions of hematological toxicities and TLS.  Hematological toxicities will be graded as 
specified in the iwCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( Hallek, 2008 ) (Appendix 21.4) .  TLS will be graded as specified by [CONTACT_137785]-
Bishop grading system ( Appendix 21.3 ).
The use of hematopoietic growth factors is permitted.  Treatment with myeloid growth factors 
is strongly encouraged following ASCO guidelines recommendation ( Smith, 2006 ) for dosing 
and administration when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 1,000/ μL [NOTE: 
per the inclusion criteria, subjects must have an ANC ≥ 1000/μL to be eligible for study entry].  
Subjects will continue in the study and receiv e study drug until discontinuation from the study 
for any of the following reasons: disease progression; AEs that, in the judgment of the
Investigator, may cause severe or permanent harm  or which rule out continuation of study drug, 
subject withdraws consent, subject is lost to  follow-up, death, protocol violation that may rule
out continuation of study drug and other reasons  that in the judgment of the Investigator may 
rule out continuation of study drug.
For those subjects who discontinue study drug for reasons other than disease progression or 
withdrawal of consent, study visits should c ontinue every [ADDRESS_281480].  During these visits only the following assessments will be required: 
hematology, ECOG performance status, evaluation of constitutional symptoms, physical exam 
for liver, spleen and lymph nodes, adverse events, assessment for second primary malignancies,concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and assessment of response.
For subjects who develop PD characterized by [CONTACT_233264] a more aggressive histology 
[i.e. Richter’s syndrome (lymphomas) or prolymphocytic leukemia], this diagnosis should be established by [CONTACT_233265].

free basis in agreement with the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_233208].
Response Assessment
Tumor response will be assessed according to the iwCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and 
treatment of CLL ( Hallek, 2008 ), including CR, CRi, nPR, PR, SD and PD.  Evaluation of 
response will be performed after [ADDRESS_281481], abdomen and pelvis 
to assess lymphadenopathies will be performed at the PR and CR/CRi confirmation visits ( ≥ 8 
weeks to ≤ 12 weeks)after all clinical and laboratory response criteria have been met for PR or 
CR/CRi).  Those subjects whose response was down-graded based on the CT scan 
interpretation at the PR or CR/CRi confirmation visit will have the CT scan repeated 4 months 
later at the location where remaining disease has been documented, as long as clinical and laboratory response remains present to try to document further improvement.
For those subjects who reach CR or CRi, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_233209]/CRi confirmation visit ( ≥ 8 weeks to ≤ [ADDRESS_281482] been m et).  If the bone marrow is hypocellular, a repeat 
specimen should be obtained after [ADDRESS_281483] recovered. If 
the bone marrow biopsy shows disease involvement (30% or greater lymphocytes, or nodules positive for B-CLL cells by [CONTACT_9064]), an additional bone marrow biopsy and

Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), infection and thromboembolism and treatment of 
tumor flare reaction (TFR):
TLS and TFR 
TLS prophylaxis, comprising of oral hydration a nd allopurinol 300 mg/day will be initiated at 
least [ADDRESS_281491] be instructed to drink 8 to 10 eight ounce (240 mL) glasses of water each 
day for the first [ADDRESS_281492]’s cardiovascular status indicates the possibility of volume overload.
Grade 1 TFR may be treated with NSAIDs and TFR ≥ Grade 2 may be treated with 
corticosteroids.  Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for pain control in subjects 
experiencing ≥ Grade 2 TFR.
Subjects will be monitored for TLS and TFR as follows:
!On Day 2 and 4 and then weekly (Days 8, 15, 22) for cycle [ADDRESS_281493] cycle of 
each dose escalation
!On Day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 2 (if not dose escalated)
!At least every 28 days thereafter and as clinically indicated.
Thromboembolic Events Prophylaxis
Lenalidomide may increase the risk of thromboembolic events in subjects who are at high risk 
(high risk is defined for example as a history of a thromboembolic event and/or taking a concomitant medication associated with an increased risk for a thromboembolic event and/or a 
known hypercoagulable state regardless of thromboembo lic history). All subjects s hould 
receive anti-thrombotic prophylaxis during study treatment.  For subjects who enter the study with a platelet count close to the eligibility criteria of ≥ 50,000/ μL, the medical monitor should 
be contact[CONTACT_233267]-thrombotic prophyl axis.  The recommended prophylaxis is low-
dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [ASA] (70-100mg) daily; however, another prophylactic anti-thrombotic therapy 
may be used per investigator’s discretion during study treatment. Choice of the most 
appropriate anti-thrombotic therapy for each s ubject should be based upon a careful evaluation 
of the different risk factors associated with each therapy, and a corresponding assessment of the individual subject’s underlying medical condition.  Selection should be based on the overall 
benefit-to-risk ratio. Use of low molecular we ight heparin or warfarin (or equivalent Vitamin K &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7ment of ent of

anti-thrombotic therapy according to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233213].
If platelets drop below 50,000/ μL, the investigator should consider interrupting or adjusting the 
dose of anti-thrombotic therapy. In the event that platelets drop below 20,000/ μL and the anti-
thrombotic therapy has not already been in terrupted, the investigator should again strongly 
consider interrupting the anti-thrombotic therapy.  In addition, for platelets < 20,000/μL, 
lenalidomide should be interrupted and CBC s hould be followed every 7 days.  Appropriate 
interventions (i.e., platelet infusion) should be considered where applicable. 
Infection
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered in subjects with neutropenia.  In addition, 
subjects who were on prophylactic treatment for infection while on alemtuzumab therapy 
should continue prophylactic treatment for at least 6 months following the discontinuation of 
alemtuzumab therapy and can be enrolled into the study while continuing prophylactic therapy.
Data Monitoring Committee
An independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety and efficacy 
data collected during the conduct of the study.  DMC Meetings will occur approximately every 3 months during enrollment (with the first meeting occurring when ~[ADDRESS_281495] cycle of treatm ent) and twice per year thereafte r.  In addition, safety data 
will be reviewed in an ongoing manner to assess benefit-to-risk considerations; accrual will be stopped to a treatment arm if unacceptable toxicities are observed in that treatment arm.
Response Adjudication Committee
An independent Response Adjudication Committee (RAC) will perform a blinded, independent 
assessment of response (including the development of PD) prior to database lock.  The RAC 
adjudicated response data will be used in the efficacy analysis for the study.

All other measurements will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, 
minimum, and maximum.  Graphical displays will be provided where useful in the 
interpretation of results.
Efficacy Analysis
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that includes all 
subjects randomized.
Response, duration of response, TTR, TTP, EFS, PFS, and OS will be summarized.  The

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-[ADDRESS_281510].  During these visits 
for these subjects only the following assessments are required: hematology, ECOG performance status, evaluation of constitution al symptoms, physical exam 
for liver, spleen and lymph nodes, adverse events, assessment for second primary malignancies, concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_233218].  
d. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a medically supervised pregnancy test (serum or urine with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) per the 
frequency specified in Appendix 21.[ADDRESS_281511] palpable nodes in each of the following sites:  cervical, 
axillary, supraclavicular, inguinal and femoral.  The size of th e liver and spleen will be assessed by [CONTACT_233273].
g. Vital signs include:  temperature, pulse, blood pressure, weight and height (height to be measured during screening only).h. CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis to assess lymphadenopathies will be performed during screening and at the PR and CR/CRi confirmation 
visits (≥8 weeks - ≤ [ADDRESS_281512] been met for PR or CR/CRi) and for all subjects, except those  who 
discontinue due to PDs, at the treatment discontinuation visit.  At screening, if medically justified, the possibility of not r epeating the CT Scan when 
previously performed within [ADDRESS_281513] scan interpretation at the PR or CR/CRi confirmation visit will have the CT scan repea ted 4 months later at the 
location where remaining disease has been documented as long as clinical and laboratory response remains present to try to docu ment further improvement..
i. ECG will be performed and interpreted locally.  After the screening ECG, the next ECG will be done at Cycle 3 Day 1, and then every 12 weeks while on 
study drug, and at treatment discontinuation.
j. TLS prophylaxis, comprising of oral hydration and allopurinol 300 mg/day will be initiated at least [ADDRESS_281514]’s cardiovascular status indicates the possibility of volume overload.
k. Hematology: Local lab assessments include HGB, ANC, ALC and platelet count.  At screening, subject must meet eligibility crit eria based on central lab 
results.  At Study Day 1, subject must meet eligibility criteria based on local or central lab results prior to initiating stud y therapy
l. Chemistry: Local lab assessments include potassium, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, total bilirubin, AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, and  uric acid.  At screening, 
subject must meet eligibility criteria based on central lab results.  At Study Day 1, subject must meet eligibility criteria ba sed on local or central lab results 
prior to initiating study therapy, however, a re-calculation of creatinine clearance is not required at Study Day 1.
m. Urinalysis:  Local laboratory assessments will in clude ketones, sediments and specific gravity.  
n. DAT (direct antiglobulin test) will be performed at screening and analyzed at the central laboratory.  The DAT test should be repeated if the investigator 
suspects hemolytic anemia during the course of the study. Analysis of DAT will be completed by [CONTACT_233274] a mendment, protocol 
amendment #6.
o. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), free T3, and free T4 levels will be assessed at screening, Cycle 3 Day 1 and every 12 week s while on study drug and at 
treatment discontinuation.  All samples will be analyzed centrally.  Collection of TSH samples is discontinued as of this amend ment, protocol amendment #6.
p. A peripheral blood, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_233219] 1 day 1and at the CR/CRi confirmation visit.  At screening, if medically justified, the possibilit y of not repeating the bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy when previously performed within 56 days of randomization will be evaluated by [CONTACT_233275] a case by [CONTACT_23353]

study, from the time of signing the informed consent up to and including the survival follow up period.  Subjects will be follo wed until 80% of the subjects 
have progressed or died or up to five years after the last subject was randomized, whichever occurs later.  Events of second pri mary malignancy are to be 
reported using the SAE report form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply;  these events must also be 
documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and subject’s source documents.  Documentation on the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy must 
be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (e .g., any confirmatory histology or cytology results, X-rays, CT scans, etc.).
v. Investigators to provide assessment of CR, CRi, nPR, PR, SD, and PD based on laboratory, physical exam, assessment of constit utional symptoms and if 
appropriate CT scan findings (CT scans are to be performed at baseline and to confirm PR or CR/CRi).  For confirmed PR, nPR or CR/CRi, response must be 
maintained for ≥ 8 weeks as per the iwCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL ( Hallek, 2008 ) Tumor response will be assessed according to

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-[ADDRESS_281536] of newly diagnosed patients are under the age of 65 years ( Leukemia and Lymphoma 
Society, 2008 ).  It is an incurable lymphoproliferative malignancy manifested by [CONTACT_233278], 
bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues.  The clinical course of CLL ranges from indolent disease 
(Rai 0, Binet A) with long-term survival over 12 years to aggressive disease (Rai III/IV, Binet C) 
with median survival of 2 years ( Montserrat, 1995 ).
Multiple, randomized, Phase [ADDRESS_281537] attempted to identify treatments that improve overall 
survival (OS).  Chlorambucil, approved by [CONTACT_69391] 1957, is a well-tolerated oral agent that can induce partial remissions (PR) in advanced stage CLL patients and has been in use for 
many decades.  In early stage CLL patients, the French Co-operative group on CLL ( Dighiero, 
1998 ) reported that early therapy with alkylato r-based therapy did not improve survival 
compared to observation alone. Due to the av ailability of newer treatment options demonstrating 
improved efficacy, chlorambucil is not cons idered the optimal first-line treatment cho ice by 
[CONTACT_233279].  However, the drug is still considered a valid treatment option for elderly patients and those with comorbidities that preclude treatment with more aggressive 
treatment regimens.
Fludarabine is approved by [CONTACT_1622] (April 1991) as  a second-line agent.  Clinical studies of 
fludarabine have shown superior overall response rates, complete response rates, and progression 
free survival, but no improvement in overall survival was noted ( Rai, 2000 ) (Catovsky, 2007 )  In 
recent years, data from several phase 2/3 clinical studies in which fludarabine was combined with cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab demonstr ated high response rates and long progression-
free survivals, with increased toxicity compared to chlorambucil, but as yet have not shown a 
survival benefit ( O’Brien, 2001 ) (By[CONTACT_26752], 2003 ) (Wierda, 2005 ) (Eichhorst, 2006 ) (Tam, 2007 ).
In September 2007, alemtuzumab was also approved as first line therapy of B-cell CLL.  In an 
open-label, randomized (1:1) study of 297 p atients, the patients receiving alemtuzumab 
experienced longer PFS compared to those randomized to receive chlorambucil (median PFS 14.6 months vs. 11.7 months respectively).  The overall response rates (ORR) were 83% and 
55% (p < 0.0001) and the CR rates were 24% and 2% (p < 0.0001) ( Hillmen, 2007 ).
In March 2008, bendamustine was approved fo r the treatment of pati ents with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia.  The labeling states “Efficacy relative to first line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_233230]”.  The study comparing bendamustine, 100 mg/m
2 IV on 
days 1 and 2 every 28 days, to chlorambucil , 0.8 mg/kg/day orally on days 1 and 15 every 28 
days, was conducted in 301 patients (153 on bendamustine and 148 on chlorambucil) with Binet 
stage B or C (Rai stages I-IV) requiring treatment.  The ORR was 59% for bendamustine vs 26% 
for chlorambucil (p < 0.0001) with 8% vs <1% CRs for bendamustine and chlorambucil arms, respectively.  The median PFS was 18 months for bendamustine vs 6 months for chlorambucil (p 
< 0.0001) ( TREANDA package insert, 2008 ).  Since receiving FDA approval in 2008, market blood, blood,

relapsed/refractory setting either as a si ngle-agent or in combination with rituximab.
Based on these data and the indolent clinical course of many CLL patients, the current medical 
practice for most early stage CLL patients is that of “watchful waiting.” For those CLL patients with advanced stage disease who require treatmen t, initial treatment selection is largely based on 
age, performance status and co-morbid conditions and is either chlorambucil monotherapy,
fludarabine-based or bendamustine-based combination regimens.
Many CLL patients relapse after initial therapy.  Second-line treatment and subsequent 
treatments often consist of purine-analog-bas ed treatment regimens.  Eighty-five percent of 
patients previously responsive to fludarabine respond to re-treatment with the same agent but the response rate falls to 12% in patients who were refractory to previous fludarabine therapy when 
re-treated with fludarabine single agent ( Thomas, 1998 ), and between 39% to 58% in patients re-
treated with fludarabine combined therapy (fludarabine with cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphamide and rituximab) ( O’Brien, 2001 ) (Wierda, 2005 ).  Patients who become 
refractory or resistant to purine analogues containing regimens have a poor prognosis and limited 
therapeutic options.
On 07 May 2007, alemtuzumab was initially a pproved for patients previously treated with 
alkylating agents and refractory to fludarabine.  In a study of 93 heavily pretreated fludarabine 
refractory patients a response rate of 33% (2% CR) was achieved, with the median time to progression for responders of 9.5 months and a median overall survival of 16 months for all 
patients and 32 months for responders ( Keating, 2002 ).  Subjects in this study with at least one 
lymph node > 5 cm (bulky lymphadenopathy) achieved a 12% PR and 0% CR.  Toxicity with alemtuzumab therapy was not negligible a nd included infusion-re lated toxicity (81%), 
immunosuppression, and infections (55%) with reactivation of cytomegalovirus seen in 7 
patients.
On 19 September 2007, alemtuzumab’s accelerated approval was converted to a full approval 
with a revised indication, “as a single agent for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (B-CLL)”.  In an open-label, randomized (1:1) study of 297 patients, the patients who 
received alemtuzumab experienced longer PFS comp ared to those randomized to receive 
chlorambucil (median PFS 14.6 months vs. 11.7 months, respectively).  The ORRs were 83% 
and 55% (p < 0.0001), and the CR rates were 24% and 2% (p < 0.0001).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_233231], use of alemtuzumab as a treatment for previously untreated patients remains very limited.
Although alemtuzumab has demonstrated efficacy in  the fludarabine-refractory CLL population, 
several studies have shown that patients that have CLL bulky disease (i.e lymphadenopathy greater than 5 cm) are poor responders to alemtuzumab therapy ( Keating, 2002 ) (Fiegl, 2006 ) 
(Osterborg, 1997 ). A recent historical review by [CONTACT_233280] ( Tam, 2007 ) underlines that 
fludarabine refractory CLL patients who have bulky lymphadenopathy constitute a high unmet medical need despi[INVESTIGATOR_233232].
On 26 October 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to 
ofatumumab (Arzerra™) for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. The approval was based on a clinically meaningful 
and durable overall response rate (ORR) observed in a single-arm, multicenter trial in 154

5.2. Lenalidomide
Lenalidomide (REVLIMID®; Celgene Corp., NJ, [LOCATION_003]) is a member of a class of pharmaceut ical 
compounds known as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs P®
P).  It offers potential benefit over the 
first commercially available IMiD, thalidomide, in terms of both safety and efficacy in human 
subjects ( Galustian, 2004 ) (Tohnya, 2004 ).  The key to its therapeutic potential lies in the fact 
that it has multiple mechanisms of action, which act to produce both anti-inflammatory and anti-
tumor effects.  These effects are thought to be contextual in that they depend on both the cell 
type and the triggering stimulus.  To date, lenalidomide has been associated with TNF- α 
inhibitory, T cell costimulatory, and antiangiogenic activities ( Galustian, 2004 ).
REVLIMID®has been approved by [CONTACT_233281] (including the FDA, but 
excluding the EU) for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to Low-or Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetics 
abnormality with or without other cytogenetic abnorm alities.
REVLIMID
®has also been approved by [CONTACT_233281] (notably including 
the US and EU) in combination with dexamethasone, for patients with previously treated 
multiple myeloma. 
Lenalidomide is being investigated as treatment for various oncologic indications, including 
multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and solid tumors.  It is also being explored as a 
treatment for inflammatory conditions.  While man y of the studies are ongoing, results from 
controlled and uncontrolled studies in subjects with MDS and MM are available.
5.3. Background and rationale for lenalidomide in chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia
5.3.1. Background
The cellular interplay between the microenvironment and the malignant CLL clone and the 
decreased sensitivity of B-CLL cells to apoptotic signal is thought to play an important role in 
the pathophysiology and development of CLL disease ( Ghia, 2005 ).  CLL cells can secrete 
various prosurvival cytokines (TNF- α, IL-6 and VEGF) and modulate their receptor expression 
in a paracrine/autocrine growth loop manner ( Hoffbrand, 1993 ).
Lenalidomide has been reported to inhibit TNF- αproduction, modulate cytokine production and 
also to have immunomodulatory properties that ar e thought to be critical for the activity of this 
drug in chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( Corral, 1996 ) (Corral, 1999 ).  Lenalidomide co-
stimulates T-cells and enhances antitumor immuni ty, which is mediated by T-helper-1 type 
cytokines, such as interferon- γ and interleukin-2 (IL-2); it also enhances other innate immune uttical ica

2005 ).
Additional experiments performed in vitro confirmed the ability of lenalidomide to increase NK-
cell mediated killing of primary B-CLL tumor cells in both a PBMC co-culture model and NK mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) model ( Wu, 2008 )(Lapalombella, 
2008 ).  Co-treatment of B-CLL cells and NK cells with lenalidomide was shown to enhance
rituximab-mediated ADCC in vitro, however a greater enhancement was observed when B-CLL cells were not pre-treated with lenalidomide sugge sting that alternative sequencing strategies 
might be also beneficial when combining the two drugs in a clinical setting (Lapalombella, 
2008) .  Interestingly, lenalidomide also synergized with rituximab to promote animal survival in 
a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse-disseminated lymphoma xenograph model.  
Lenalidomide treatment enhanced rituximab’s NK cell antitumor activity, and resulted in the in 
vivo expansion of murine NK cells, suggesting a role for the co-stimulatory properties of this agent in this model ( Hernandez- Ilizaliturri, 2005 ).
The potential ability of lenalidomide to enhance immune cell recognition in CLL was also 
reported in a recent work by [CONTACT_233283]. ( Ramsay, 2008 ) demonstrating that lenalidomide can 
modulate the actin cytoskeleton and improve the defect in B-CLL cells and T-cells immune 
synapse formation and function. 
Additional work is underway to better elucidate lenalidomide’s mechanism of action in CLL and 
its ability to modul ate the cellular interplay between the microenvironment and the malignant 
CLL clone.
5.3.2. Clinical studies 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relapsed/refractory CLL
Initial clinical studies were conducted with thalidomide, a less potent immune modulator than 
lenalidomide also capable of inhibiting TNF- α, that has known anti-angiogenic properties.  
Thalidomide was studied in combination with fludarabine in previously untreated CLL ( Chanan-
Khan, 2005 ).  Although this study investigated the efficacy and safety of the combination 
regimen of fludarabine and thalidomide, the design of the study called for the administration of 
thalidomide alone for the first 7 days of therapy, after which fludarabine was added.  Antitumor 
effects, manifested as reduction on the peripheral blood lymphocyte count, occurred within 7 days of starting thalidomide, prior to institution of fludarabine, suggesting that thalidomide alone 
has anti-CLL activity.
Based on the observations made with thalidomide, single-agent lenalidomide was studied in 
relapsed/refractory CLL ( Chanan-Khan, 2006a ) (Ferrajoli, 2008 ).  Chanan-Khan treated patients 
with relapsed/refractory CLL with lenalidomid e (25mg x 21 d q 28 days).  Patients with stable 
disease (SD) or better response were continued on therapy for a maximum of 12 months while those with progressive disease (PD) were to receive monthly rituximab (375mg/m2) added to 
lenalidomide.  Forty-five patients were e nrolled.  Median age was 64 years (range: 47 to 75 
years), and advanced Rai stage (III or IV) disease was noted in 64%.  The median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_233233] (range:  1 to 10 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), with 51% of the patients refractory to 
fludarabine.  Using an intent-to-treat analysis, major responses were seen in 26 patients (57.7%; 
95% CI, 32% to 62%) with six patients (13.3%) achieving a CR, including 5 (11%) molecular

day 8 of treatment with 24 (70.5%) of 34 patients (34 patients who had day 1 ALC of >5000 
cells/uL and day 8 ALC available) demonstrating a decrease in their peripheral blood absolute 
lymphocyte count (ALC).  Clinical responses (CR or PR) were observed in 40% of the patients with del (11)(q23) adverse cytogenetics and in 40% of patients with bulky disease.  The median 
PFS of all patients enrolled was 19.4 months (range 1.2-31.8) ( Chanan-Khan, 2007 ).  Fatigue 
(83%) and flare reaction (tender swelling of lymph nodes and/or rash) (58%) were the mostcommon non-hematologic AEs reported.  Other important AEs reported were tumor lysis 
syndrome (5%); Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (45%), and Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (70%).  
Pulmonary embolism was reported in two patients (5%).
Ferrajoli treated patients with relapsed/refractory  CLL with lenalidomide administered daily for 
[ADDRESS_281542] by 5 mg increments every 28 days to a 
maximum dose of 25 mg daily.  Forty-four (44) patients have been enrolled and were evaluated 
for response.  The median daily dose of lenalidomid e tolerated by [CONTACT_233284] 10 mg.  The 
median age was 64 years (range:  49 to 86 years), the median number of prior treatments was 5 (range:  1 to 15), and the median β2M at entry was 4.3 mg/dL (1.6 to 10.1).  Fifty nine percent of 
the patients carried unfavorable genomic abnormalities (17p or 11q23 deletions) and 66% had 
unmutated V
H.  Twelve patients (27%) were refractory to fludarabine.  Responses according to 
NCI-WG criteria assessed after 3 months of treatment based on an intent-to-treat analysis 
showed that 14 patients (32%) had achieved a response [3 CR (7%), 1 nodular PR (2%), 10 PR 
(23%)].  Time to best response was 6 months in 11 patients and 9 months in 3 patients.  The median response duration has not been reached.  Eleven patients (25%) had stable disease (SD) 
or clinical improvement and were able to continue on treatment past the third month, and 17 
patients (39%) progressed and two patients died of early infectious complication.  Thirty two patients (73%) are alive with a median follow up of [ADDRESS_281543] 
common toxicity with in the courses, 41% ∀Grade 3 neutropenia and 16% Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia.  TFR was observed in 12% of the courses (Grade &2 in 10% and Grade ∀3 
in 2%), with a greater incidence (53%) in patients  with lymph nodes larger than 5 cm.  Grade ∀3 
fatigue and diarrhea were reported in 1% and 2% of the courses, respectively.
TFR was a frequent adverse event reported in both studies and was well managed with non 
steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and/ or corticosteroids or in some case narcotic 
analgesics.  In Chanan-Khan’s study (Chanan-Khan, 2006b ), out of the [ADDRESS_281544] 29 patients (Group A).  Subsequently, 
16 patients received prophylaxis with prednisone 20 mg po qd x 5 days followed by 10 mg po qd x 5 days starting on Day 1 of treatment (Group B).  The prophylaxis did not decrease the 
incidence of TFR (83% [Group A] vs. 81% [Group B]).  TFR ≥ Grade 2 was seen in 31% of 
Group A and 6% of Group B.  It thus appears that steroid prophylaxis decreases the severity of the reaction, but not the overall incidence.  In the group of patients who developed tumor flare, 4 
CRs were achieved, all in patients who had experienced ≥ Grade 2 tumor flare reaction in 
comparison to 19 patients with ≤ PR who had experienced a median tumor flare severity Grade 1 
(Chanan-Khan, 2006a ).  These preliminary data seem to indicate that patients who develop a 
more severe flare reaction may also achieve a better  remission.  However, in Ferrajoli et al. study 
the occurrence of a tumor flare reaction did not predict for a higher response rate with an overall response of 38% and 34% in patients with and without a TFR ( Ferrajoli, 2008 ).&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21%).  %).

non-neutropenic respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/sinus/skin infections.  TFR occurred in 18 subjects (78%).  Although 
most subjects experienced TFR in the first week on study, many also continued to experience flare symptoms with subsequent cycles (30.6% of all 186 cycles).  Most tumor flare symptoms

[IP_ADDRESS]. Study CC-5013-CLL-001
Based on these initial data in patients with relaps ed/refractory CLL, a large multicenter phase 2 
study (CC-5013-CLL-001) was initiated to investigate two lenalidomide dose regimens, 10 mg 
daily and 25 mg x 21 days q 28 days, and confirm the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in the 
treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL.  The study  did not include a dose escalation peri od.  After 
[ADDRESS_281550] cycle of treatment.  Metabolic 
abnormalities and/or renal dysfunction resolved with supportive therapy in [ADDRESS_281551] been observed with other active and immune modulating 
agents in CLL ( Yang,1999 ) (By[CONTACT_26752], 2007 ) mostly occurring in early phases of treatment.  The use 
of low dose-intensity regimens at the initiation of therapy, aggressive TLS prophylaxis, and 
increased patient monitoring decreased the incidence of TLS during treatment with these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  TFR during lenalidomide therapy has been observed in both CLL and small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients.  TFR and TLS were also observed in two phase 2 studies 
that recently reported the effects of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL (Chanan-Khan, 2006a ) (Ferrajoli, 2007 ).  In the Chanan-Khan et al. study TFR occurred in 58% 
of patients (Grade &2 in 50% and Grade ∀3 in 8%) and TLS occurred in 5% of the patients (all 
Grade 3).  The second study by [CONTACT_233285]. reported 37 % TFR (Grade &2 in 30% and Grade 
∀3 in 7% of patients) and no TLS.  Notably, the Chanan-Khan et al. study used a starting dose of 
[ADDRESS_281552] by 5 mg increments every 28 days to a 
maximum dose of 25 mg daily.
TFR in lenalidomide-treated CLL patients in clinical studies has usually been Grade 1-2 and has 
been well managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or steroids.
The CC-5013-CLL-001 protocol was amended into a phase 1/[ADDRESS_281553] failed fludarabine were started on 2.5 mg of lenalidomide daily, 
followed by [CONTACT_233286]-patient dose escalation to 5 mg after 28 days as tolerated ( Wendtner, 
2010 ).  Doses were then escalated as tolerated by 5 mg every 28 days by [CONTACT_233287] 6 
patients, until the maximum tolerated dose escalation level (MTDEL) was defined or a maximum 
dose of [ADDRESS_281554] 3 cycles.  The redesigned phase I study enrolled 52 patients with a median

prevention strategy resulted in only 2 (3.8%) cases of TLS, both observed at 2.5 mg/daily (1 
patient with Grade 2 and another with lab TLS).  Grade 3/4 tumor flare occurred in 5 (9.6%) 
patients and was managed with NSAIDs or lo w-dose steroids. The most common Grade 3/4 
adverse events (AEs) included neutropenia (65%) and thrombocytopenia (33%). Febr ile 
neutropenia occurred in 4 (8%) patients. Grade 3/4 infections were observed in 21 (40%) 
patients; 10 (19%) patients developed pneumonia and 3 developed sepsis; 2 cases of sepsis-related death at day 37 and 94 of therapy were also noted but deemed unrelated to study drug by 
[CONTACT_473]. Reasons for study discontinuation included disease progression (37%), AE’s 
(29%), consent withdrawal (15%), death (4%), other reasons (10%).  For 16 (31%) patients, 2.5 mg/daily was the maximum dose reached a nd 22 (42%) patients were  unable to escalate be yond

to-treat (ITT) analysis, 6 patients (12%) had a partial response (NCI-WG 1996), 30 patients (58%) had stable disease and 13 patients (25%) progressed; 3 patients were non-evaluable. 
Median duration of treatment was 3.1 months (range , 0.07-18.4) and the median  time to response 
was 4.3 months (range, 2.8-7.4). Responses we re observed at 10 mg/daily (n=3), at 15 mg/daily
(n=1), and at 20 mg/daily (n=2); Median PFS (ITT) was 5.5 months and median PFS for 
responders was 12 months. Three patients still remain on therapy and were transferred to 
commercial lenalidomide. (Data on file at Celgene)
5.3.3. Rationale for study CC-5013-CLL-009
Patients with purine-analog or bendamustine relapsed/refractory CLL have limited therapeutic 
options and the addition of novel agents with alternative mechanisms of action are needed.  Several studies have been conducted with lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory CLL and have 
demonstrated a good activity; however an optimal starting dose remains to be determined.  Three 
different starting dose regimens of 5 mg daily, 10 mg daily and 15 mg daily respectively will be 
evaluated in CC-5013-CLL-009.  These starting doses are based on a review by [CONTACT_233290] (DMC) and an expert steering committee review of the 
safety and efficacy results of CC-5013-CLL-[ADDRESS_281555] demonstrated a consistent, manageable, comparable toxicity profile for subjects 
beginning therapy at either the 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg starting doses when adequate prophylaxis 
measures for TLS are implemented (increased duration of allopurinol prophylaxis with increased hydration, and increased monitoring of electrolytes  with correction of electrolyte abnormalities 
prior to the initiation of study drug) ( Ferrajoli, 2008 ) (Chen, 2008 ).  Data also indicate that 
starting therapy at lenalidomide doses higher than 2.5 mg daily may provide superior efficacy.  In light of these data, Celgene consulted expert clinicians; these experts supported a reduction in 
the number of dose escalation steps and thought a minimum efficacious dose to be in the range 
of 10 to 15 mg in relapsed CLL.  As a result,  CC-5013-CLL-009 was developed to study starting 
dose of 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg followed by a step-wise dose escalation to a maximum dose of 
25 mg daily as tolerated to allow for fewer escalations to reach a higher dose.
This study will be conducted in accordan ce with “good clinical practice” (GCP) and all 
applicable regulatory requirements, including, where applicable, the 2008 version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki (see Appendix 21.2 ).

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-[ADDRESS_281557] udy will compare different treatment regimens (starting dose 
of 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg daily, followed by [CONTACT_182903]-patient escalation up to a maximum of 25 
mg daily) using a Bayesian approach to evaluate both efficacy and toxicity.  This adaptive design will consider joint efficacy (progression rate) and toxicity outcomes to stop randomization of less 
promising arms ( Bekele, 2008b ).  At any time accrual to a star ting dose arm will be stopped if 
unacceptable toxicities are observed in that arm.
8.1.3. Randomization
Based on consideration of the Bayesian approach the following randomization schema will be 
followed:
!Initially subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) in  a double-blind fashion to the 5 mg, 10 
mg, and 15 mg starting dose arms (treatment arm 1, treatment arm 2, and treatment arm 3 respectively).  
!After 18 subjects complete one 28 day cycle, an interim analysis will be conducted to 
review the safety of each starting dose arm(s).  Subsequent interim analyses to review 
the safety and progression rate of each starting dose arm(s) will occur at 13-week 
intervals.  After review of each interim analysis, a treatment arm may be dropped.  At any time accrual to a starting dose arm will also be stopped if unacceptable toxicities 
are observed in that arm.  If a treatment arm is dropped then all new subjects will be 
randomized equally into the remaining arm(s).
Stratification
To minimize potential imbalances within treatment groups due to select patient characteristics 
that may impact outcomes, study subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_233292]:
!Relapsed versus refractory to their last purine-analog or bendamustine based 
treatment regimen [relapsed/refractory as defined per the iwCLL guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of CLL ( Hallek, 2008 )].  If a subject has had prior purine-&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21nd then then

2006a ) (Chanan Khan, 2007 ) (Ferrajoli, 2008 ).  In the Chanan-Khan study the median time to 
best response was 5.9 months (range 1.6 to 18.3 months).  In the Ferrajoli study time to best response was [ADDRESS_281560] tolerability, as follows:
!Treatment Arm 1:  5 mg →10 mg →15 mg →20 mg →25 mg/daily
!Treatment Arm 2:  10 mg →15 mg →20 mg →25 mg/daily
!Treatment Arm 3:  15 mg →20 mg →25 mg/daily
Toxicities requiring dose interruption and/or modification are described in Section 10.2.[ADDRESS_281561]’s treatment regimen, 
the study was a double-blinded trial.  The blind was removed once all patients had completed 3 
cycles of treatment.
8.1.7. Safety
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE (Version 3.0) used as a 
guide for the grading of severity with the ex ceptions of hematological toxicities and TLS.  
Hematological toxicities will be graded as spec ified in the iwCLL guidelines for the diagnosis 
and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( Hallek, 2008 ) (Appendix 21.4 ).  TLS will be 
graded as specified by [CONTACT_137785]-Bishop grading system ( Appendix 21.3 ).

subject was randomized, whichever occurs later.
8.1.8. Efficacy 
Tumor response will be assessed according to the iwCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and 
treatment of CLL ( Hallek, 2008 ), including CR, CRi, nPR, PR, SD, and PD.  Evaluation of 
response will be performed after [ADDRESS_281562], abdomen and pelvis 
to assess lymphadenopathies will be performed at the PR and CR/CRi confirmation visits ( ≥8 
weeks to ≤ [ADDRESS_281563] been met for PR or 
CR/CRi).  Those subjects whose response was down-graded based on the CT scan interpretation at the PR or CR/CRi confirmation visit will have the CT scan repeated 4 months later at the 
location where remaining disease has been documented, as long as clinical and laboratory 
response remains present to try to document further improvement.
For those subjects who reach CR or CRi, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_233237]/CRi confirmation visit ( ≥ 8 weeks to ≤ [ADDRESS_281564] been m et).  If the bone marrow is hypocellular, a repeat 
specimen should be obtained after [ADDRESS_281565] recovered. If 
the bone marrow biopsy shows disease involvement (30% or greater lymphocytes, or nodules

Response Adjudication Committee
An independent Response Adjudication Committee (RAC) will perform a blinded, assessment of 
response (including assessment of SD and of PD) prior to database lock.  The RAC adjudicated response data will be used in the efficacy analysis for the study.
8.1.9. Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety and efficacy 
data collected during the conduct of the study. DMC Meetings will occur approximately every 3
months during enrollment and no less than twice per year thereafter.  In addition, safety data will 
be reviewed in an ongoing manner to assess benefit-to-risk considerations; accrual will be stopped if unacceptable toxicities are observed in a treatment arm.
8.1.10. Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be performed in up to 40 subjects.  Following the enrollment 
of 90 subjects, participation in the PK sub-study will be mandatory for all additional subjects 
enrolled.  Intensive sampling and sparse sampling will be discontinued as of this amendment, 
protocol amendment #6.  Lenalidomide concentration data obtained from all visits may be used 
to develop the population PK model.  The relationship between pharmacokinetics and response 
(biomarkers or clinical outcomes as appropriate) will be explored.
8.1.11. Exploratory Biomarkers
Rationale
Biomarkers are objectively measured indicators of biological or pathogenic processes, or 
pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.  In CLL, there is particular interest in the 
molecular changes that may identify disease subtypes, stage of disease, or predict high-risk 
disease or disease progression.

Confidential and Propri etary 57 CC-5013-CLL-009 Amendment 6 Final 15Apr201510. DESCRIPTION OF TREATMENT 
10.1. Description of Study Drug
Celgene Corporation will supply lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg 
capsules for oral administration.  Subjects will receive 28 days of lenalidomide per cycle.
Study drug will be packaged in bottles containing study capsules for 28 days.
10.2. Treatment Assignments
10.2.1. Randomization
Randomization will be accomplished by a validated interactive voice response system (IVRS) to 
ensure timely registration and randomization.  De signated site staff will be assigned password 
protected, coded identification numbers, which gives them authorization to call into the IVRS to 
enroll subjects.  The system will present a menu of questions by [CONTACT_233293]. When all questions have been answered, the IVRS will assign a subject number and study drug to the eligible subject. IVRS will fax a confirmation of 
registration and drug assignment for each subject to the site and Celgene.
Initially subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) in a double-blind fashion to the 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 
mg starting dose arms (treatment arm 1, treatment arm 2, and treatment arm 3 respectively).  
Subjects will be stratified at randomization by:
#relapsed vs. refractory to their last purine-analog or bendamustine based treatment 
regimen (if subject has received both, the status post most r ecent purine-analog or 
bendamustine treatment regimen will be used for stratification) and
#age < 65 years of age vs. ∀65 years of age
After 18 subjects complete one 28 day cycle, an interim analysis will be conducted to review the 
safety of each starting dose arm(s).  Subsequent interim analyses to review the safety and 
progression rate of each starting dose arm(s) will o ccur at 13-week intervals.  After review of 
each interim analysis, a treatment arm may be dropped.  At any time accrual to a starting dose arm will also be stopped if unacceptable toxicities are observed in that arm.  If a treatment arm is 
dropped then all new subjects will be randomized equally into the remaining arm(s).
Site staff must contact [CONTACT_137822].

For toxicities requiring dose interrupt ion and/or modification (see Section 10.2.3 ), a more 
gradual stepwise dose escalation of lenalidomid e (more than one 28 day cycle for each dose 
level) might be needed at the discretion of the treating physician due to adverse events that do 
not require dose reduction or interruption.
Subjects unable to escalate to the [ADDRESS_281588] dose achieved in the previous cycle or as indicated in Section 10.2.3 Dose Modification 
or Interruption.
10.2.3. Dose Modification or Interruption
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE (Version 3.0) used as a 
guide for the grading of severity with the ex ceptions of hematological toxicities and TLS.  
Hematological toxicities will be graded accordi ng to iwCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and 
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( Hallek, 2008 ) (Appendix 21.4 ).  TLS will be graded 
as specified by [CONTACT_137785]-Bishop grading system ( Appendix 21.3 ).
If a subject develops toxicity (see Table 5 Dose Reduction and Modification Guidelines), the 
dose may be reduced as outlined in Table 6 Dose Reduction Steps for Lenalidomide.

c.  For the 15 mg starting dose arm, if a dose reduction is required at Dose Level +3 (25 mg daily)or Dose Level +4 
(25 mg daily), the subject will be dose reduced directly to Dose level +1 (20 mg daily).  This will be counted as one dose reduction.
d.  If a dose reduction is required at Dose Level -4 (or at dos e level -3 in the 5 mg starting dose arm) subject will be 
discontinued from the study.
Site staff must contact [CONTACT_233299] a patient.  If the treatment has 
been withheld and the next cycle is delayed beyo nd [ADDRESS_281607] return to the study site and
return the empty bottle or any unused drug and a new bottle will be dispensed.  Subjects will be 
required to return the empty bottle or any unused drug prior to new drug being dispensed.   
Subjects should take study drug from the new bottle for the remainder of the cycle (i.e. if 
reduction occurs on Cycle Day 16, then the subject will take study drug for days 16 though 28).

Confidential and Propri etary 67 CC-5013-CLL-009 Amendment 6 Final 15Apr201510.4.1.5. Thromboembolic Events Prophylaxis
Lenalidomide may increase the risk of thromboembolic events in subjects who are at high risk 
(high risk is defined for example as a history of a thromboembolic event and/or taking a 
concomitant medication associated with an increased risk for a thromboembolic event and/or a known hypercoagulable state regardless of thromboembo lic history). All subjects s hould receive 
anti-thrombotic prophylaxis duri ng study treatment.  For sub jects who enter the study with a 
platelet count close to the eligibility criteria of ≥ 50,000/ μL, the medical monitor should be 
contact[CONTACT_233267]-thrombotic prophylaxis.  The recommended prophylaxis is low-dose 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [ASA] (70-100mg) daily; however, another prophylactic anti-thrombotic therapy may be 
used per investigator’s disc retion during study treatment. Choice of the most appropriate anti-
thrombotic therapy for each subject should be ba sed upon a careful evaluation of the different 
risk factors associated with each therapy, and a corresponding assessment of the individual 
subject’s underlying medical condition.  Selection should be based on the overall benefit-to-risk ratio. Use of low molecular weight heparin or warfarin (or equivalent Vitamin K antagonist) to 
keep the International Normalization Ratio (INR) in the range of 2-3 or other anti-thrombotic 
therapy according to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233242].
If platelets drop below 50,000/ μL, the investigator should consider interrupting or adjusting the 
dose of anti-thrombotic therapy.  In the event that platelets drop below 20,000/μL and the anti-
thrombotic therapy has not already been in terrupted, the investigator should again strongly 
consider interrupting the anti-thrombotic therapy.  In addition, for platelets < 20,000/μL, 
lenalidomide should be interrupted and CBC s hould be followed every 7 days.  Appropriate 
interventions (i.e., platelet infusion) should be considered where applicable. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other
Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_164623]’s well being may be administered at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_233243], analgesics, 
antihistamines, or other medications as well as growth factors and transfusions of red blood cells, 
platelets, or fresh frozen plasma given to assist in the management of complications associated 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or its therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prohibited Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant use of other CLL therapy or investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_233244].
10.5. Discontinuation from Treatment
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from study drug:

Accurate recording of all study drug administration (including dispensing and dosing) will be 
made in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and source documents.
11.7. Study Drug Accountability
The Investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all study drug that is issued to 
and returned by [CONTACT_137825].
11.8. Study Drug Handling and Disposal
FCBP should not handle or administer lenalidomide unless they are wearing gloves. All subjects should not extensively handle or open lenalido mide capsules and should maintain storage of 
capsules in the packaging until ingestion.
In investigational studies, st udy drug will be dispensed through a qualified healthcare 
professional (i ncluding but not limited to, nurses, pharmacists and physicians).
These healthcare professionals will be trained  by [CONTACT_233302].  Once trained, these healthcare staff will counsel subjects prior to lenalidomide being dispensed to ensure that the subject has complied with all requirements 
including use of birth control and pregnancy testing (FCBP) and that the subject understands the 
risks associated with lenalidomid e.  This step will be documented with a completed lenalidomide 
Education and Counseling Guidance Document ( Appendix 21.9 ), and no lenalidomide will be 
dispensed until this step occurs.  Counseling includes verification with the subject that required 
pregnancy testing was performed and results were negative. A Lenalidomide Information Sheet (Appendix 21.9 ) will be supplied each t ime lenalidomide is dispensed.  Celgene w ill instruct the 
Investigator(s) on the return or destruction of unused study drug.  If any study drug is lost or 
damaged, its disposition should be documented in the subject’s eCRF and source documents.  
Celgene will provide instructions for the return of study drug supplies at the end of the study.

only one sample is required.  At each of these sparse PK sampling visits, 1 blood sample will 
be collected between 1 and 10 hours (inclusive) after the morning dose. For each subject, effort should be made to collect the sample in approximately 1:1 ratio between the interval 1-
5 hours and the interval of 5-10 hours.  On the PK visit days, subjects should take the study 
drug in the morning (preferably prior to their arrival at the study site).  Subjects will not be required to fast for these PK visits.
Subjects will be asked to accurately provide the following information and report them to the 
study staff on the PK visit day for sparse PK sampling:
!Actual date and time of dosing on PK visit days and the day prior to PK visits
!Actual date and time for the last meal before dosing on PK visit days 
!Actual date and time for the food eaten within 4 hours after dosing on PK visit days
Actual date and time for blood draws should be recorded.  Lenalidomide concentration in plasma 
will be determined by a validated liquid chromatography-tendem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) method.
14.3. Assessment of Exploratory Biomarkers
The following exploratory assessment will be performed as specified in Table 2 .
!Blood samples for β2M will be collected at baseline.  
!Blood samples for ZAP-70, V Hmutational status /TP53 mutation analysis and FISH

15.1. Overview
This study will be conducted using a randomized Bayesian schedule-administration design that 
jointly models toxicity/response outcomes using an extension methods developed in ( Bekele , 
2004 ) (Bekele, 2005 ) (Bekele, 2008a ) (Bekele, 2008b ).  Schedule-administration (or treatment 
strategy) designs differ from standard treatment de signs in that the object of interest is not to 
determine if one treatment is superior to an altern ative treatment, but to determine if a particular 
treatment administration schedule is superior to other competing schedules.  In the context of the 
current design Celgene is interested in evaluati ng whether various intra-patient dose-escalation 
schemes are safe and effective while monit oring safety and efficacy (futility).  Specifically, 
while treatment starts at various doses ranging from very low doses (such as 5 mg/daily) to 
moderately low (15 mg/daily), the goal is to perform intra-patient dose escalation (every 28 days as tolerated) until a maximum dose of 25 mg/daily is  achieved.  The decision to escalate is based 
on how well the subject tolerates the lower dose levels.  While these dose escalations are taking 
place, toxicity and the progression rate will be monitored.
 
 
 
 
Operationally, the study will proceed as follows:  Subjects will be randomized to one of the three 
treatment arms.  The first interim analysis (t oxicity only) will be performed once [ADDRESS_281639] completed one 28-day cycle.  Subsequent interim analyses will occur at 13-week intervals 
to monitor both combined toxicity and progression rate.

15.2.1. Intent-to-Treat Population
The efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population, which will include all subjects 
randomized.
15.2.2. Safety Population
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the 
safety analyses.
15.2.3. Subgroup Analyses
In addition to analyses that include all subjects, analyses will be performed to compare 
treatments within the following stratification subgroups:
!Relapsed vs. refractory to their last purine-analog or bendamustine based treatment 
regimen [relapsed/refractory as defined per the iwCLL guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of CLL ( Hallek, 2008 )].    If a subject has received both, the status post &(/*(1(35235DefinitionDefinition

Additional subgroups may be examined, as needed based on regulatory and clinical requests.
15.3. Efficacy Evaluation
Efficacy analysis will be performed on intent-to -treat population. Adjudicated response will be 
used for these analyses.
Response
Response, including evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD), will be assessed by [CONTACT_233306] ( Hallek, 2008 ).  The response rate based on the 
best response during the treatment period and the relative proportions in each response category 
will be examined.  Exact test procedures for proportions will be used to compare response rate between the treatment arms.  Distributions of the responses into the response categories (CR, 
CRi, nPR, PR, SD, PD) will be provided for each treatment arm.  Response rates 
(CR+CRi+nPR+PR) together with confidence intervals will be provided for each regimen, both for the entire population and for the subgroups defined by [CONTACT_83353].
Responses from subjects after they received other anti-cancer treatments will not be counted, 
however, these subjects will be included in the denominator.
Duration of Response
Duration of response is defined as the time from the first visit where PR, CRi, or CR was 
documented to PD.  Duration of response will be censored at the last date that the subject was known to be progression-free for: 1) subjects who have not progressed at the time of analysis; 2) 
subjects who have withdrawn consent or are lost to follow-up prior to documentation of 
progression.
A two-sided log rank test stratified by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_281641] documented date of 
PR, CRi or CR based on iwCLL guidelines.
Progression-free Survival (PFS)
Progression-free survival is calculated as the time from rando mization to the first documented 
progression or death due to any cause during or after the treatment period, whichever occurs 
first.  The progression date will be assigned to the earliest time when any progression is observed without prior missing assessments. If withdrawal of consent or loss to follow-up occurs before 
documented progression or death, then these observations will be censored at the date when the 
last complete tumor assessments determined a lack of progression.
For subjects who do not develop progressive disease at the time of analysis, if the response from 
the last visit was ‘not evaluable’, the most prior visit date with complete evaluation indicating no 
progressive disease will be used as the censor date.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21d by [CONTACT_233307] t

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-009 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 82 CC-5013-CLL-009 Amendment 6 Final 15Apr2015Event-free Survival (EFS)
Event free survival (EFS) is the interval between the start of treatment to the first sign of disease 
progression, or treatment for relapse, or death (whichever occurs first)
Time-to-Progression (TTP)
TTP is defined as the time from rando mization to the first documented progression.  For subjects 
who do not progress during the study, TTP will be censored at the last adequate response 
assessment showing evidence of no disease progression. TTP is the same as PFS when there is no death.
Overall Survival (OS)
OS is calculated as the time from rando mization to d eath from any cause.  OS will be censored at 
the last date that the subject was known to be alive for subjects who were alive at the time of 
analysis and for subjects who have withdrawn consent or were lost to follow-up before death was 
documented.
The analysis of OS will include survival information for all randomized subjects.  Subjects who 
discontinued from the study and who had possibly received other anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_233247].  However, sensitivity analyses may
be performed in which these subjects will be censored at the date of the first dose date of the 
anti-cancer therapy.
15.4. Regression Analyses 
In addition we plan to perform both classical and Bayesian regression analyses in which 
predictors such as the stratification factors, treatment and possibly the treatment-by-stratification 
factor are included as covariates. Under the Bayesian framework these models will also be used 
to estimate posterior predictive probabilities for comparing the various treatments.
15.5. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subjects’ age, weight, height and other continuous demographic and baseline variables will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum), 
while performance status, gender, race and other categorical variables will be summarized with frequency tabulations for each treatment group separately and pooled over both treatment 
regimens. Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations for each 
treatment arm separately and pooled over both arms. Individual patient listings will be provided.
Homogeneity of these variables will be assessed by [CONTACT_31806]-way analysis of variance for continuous 
measures and Fisher’s exact test for categorical measures.
15.6. Study Drug
Dosage statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation and final dose, dose at each evaluation) will be provided for each treatment arm.  Time to the first dose reduction and reasons 
for dose reduction will be summarized for each treatment arm.  Reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21be censorede censore

All concomitant treatment usage documented during the study period will be su mmarized in 
frequency tabulations for each treatment group separately.  The Anatomical Therapeut ical 
Chemical (ATC) coding scheme of the World Health Organization (WHO) will be used to group 
medications into relevant categories for these tabulations.
15.8. Safety Evaluation
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.
Adverse events (AE) will be classified using th e Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification system. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 3.[ADDRESS_281642] may be used to analyze the 
difference between the treatment groups.
AEs leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment, events classified as NCI CTCAE 
version 3.0 Grade 3 or higher, study-drug-related events, and serious adverse events (SAEs), and events of interest (including second primary malignancies) will be summarized separately.
Laboratory data will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 3.[ADDRESS_281643] finished one treatment cycle. Then toxicity and progression will be assessed subsequently at

16.1. Monitoring 
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  Before the study is initiated at a s ite visit or at an investigator meeting, all aspects of 
the study are reviewed with the investigator(s) and the staff.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the 
study, a Celgene representative will review  the protocol, eCRFs, procedures for obtaining 
informed consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs with the Investigator(s).  Monitoring 
will include on-site visits with the Investigator(s) and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], fax, or telephone.  At each monitoring visit, the facilities, study drug storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documen ts, and all other study  documentation will be 
inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_233309].
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_12939] a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRF against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator(s) and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or via source data clarification forms by [CONTACT_3786](s) and/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of SAEs and the proper recording be 
verified.  Additional monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  From time to time, re presentatives of this unit will conduct audits of 
clinical research activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator(s) is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of subject participation for audits 
and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/IECs, regulatory authori ties (e.g. FDA, EMA) and company authorized 
representatives.  The Investigator(s) should make every effort to be available for the audits 
and/or inspections.  If the Investigator(s) is contact[CONTACT_233310], he/she should contact [CONTACT_27740].
16.3. Investigator(s) Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the 
US Code of Federal Regulations.  Celgene or a representative will contact [CONTACT_233311]-investigators who in turn will select their staff.  The investigator must give the monitor access to relevant records to confirm the above.  
The Investigator(s) is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an Informed 
Consent Form and are screened for entry into the study.  For those subjects who fail screening, the reason(s) for exclusion must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and on the 
Screening Log provided by [CONTACT_27718].&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21ng ng

21.1. Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new 
intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment 
of the subject’s health, including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was present prior to the signing of informed 
consent and that remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE. If there is a 
worsening of that medical condition, this should be considered an  AE. A diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded on the AE page of the Case Report Form rather than the individual signs or 
symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_737](s) from the signing of informed consent to the 
treatment discontinuation visit.  All AEs that lead  to study discontinuation should be followed 
until resolution or stabilization. For subjects who discontinue study tr eatment but continue to be 
followed every [ADDRESS_281650]’s source documents.
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if
the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:
!Results in discontinuation from the study.
!Requires treatment, modifi cation/in terruption of study drug dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention.
!Is judged by [CONTACT_737](s) to be of significant clinical importance.
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. If the abnormality was not a part 
of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the la boratory  abnorm ality s hould be recorded as the AE.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which:
!Results in death
!Is life-threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689](s) the subject is at 
immediate risk of death from the AE)
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588]

!Constitutes an important medical event
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary malignancy, regardless of causal 
relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up period.  In this study, sub jects will be followed until 80% of the subjects ha ve progressed or died
or up to five years after the last subject wa s randomized, whichever occurs later.  Events of 
second primary malignancy are to be reported using the SAE report form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be 
documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and subject's source documents.  
Documentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy must be provided at the time 
of reporting as a serious adverse event (e.g., any confirmatory histology or cytology results).   
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65777]: were planned before entry into the 
clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless 
fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied 
indication and are not associated with any deterioration in condition.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pages of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form must 
be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide in formation on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug, action taken  regarding study drug, and outcome.
Classification of severity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) must assess the severity of the event.
The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE, Version 3.0) with the 
exceptions of hematological toxicities and TLS.  Hematological toxicities will be graded as specified in the iwCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia ( Hallek, 2008 ) (Appendix 21.4 ).  TLS will be graded as specified by [CONTACT_137785]-Bishop 
grading system ( Appendix 21.3 ).  AEs will be evaluated for severity according to the following 
scale:
Grade 1 = Mild
Grade 2 = ModerateGrade 3 = Severe
Grade 4 = Life Threatening or disabling AE

Classification of Relationship/Causality of adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug
The Investigator(s) must determine the relationship between the administration of study drug and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or 
remote , or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the 
observed event
Suspected: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship possible, and other 
medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Monitoring and reporting of adverse events
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during th e study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms; laboratory, pathological, radiological, or surgical findi ngs; physical examination findings; or other 
appropriate tests and procedures.
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events
Any AE that meets the criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF.  The Investigator(s) is required to 
ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This applies to all SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, that occur during the study, those made known to the 
Investigator(s) within [ADDRESS_281651]’ s last dose of study drug, and those made known to 
the investigator(s) at anytime that are suspected of being related to study drug.
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary malignancy, regardless of causal 
relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up 
period.  In this study, sub jects will be followed until 80% of the subjects have progressed or died
or up to five years after the last subject wa s randomized, whichever occurs later.  Events of 
second primary malignancy are to be reported using the SAE report form and must be considered 
an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be 
documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and subject's source documents.  Documentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy must be provided at the time 
of reporting as a serious adverse event (e.g., any confirmatory histology or cytology results).   
The SAE must be reported immediately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of 
the event) to the Celgene Safety Monitor by [CONTACT_233317].  A phone call is to be made 
to the Safety Monitor and an initial written report (prepared by [CONTACT_737](s) using the SAE &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21drug rug

[CONTACT_3031]).
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include copi[INVESTIGATOR_233252].  If a subject has died and an autopsy has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_233253] e to be sent to Celgene as soon as these 
become available.  Any follow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, and 
sent to Celgene.
The Investigator(s) is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up 
information about the event. The Investigator(s) must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_137746], including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/IEC on file.  All SAEs that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed until 
either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/resol ves with sequelae, or returns to baseline (if a 
baseline value is available).
Pregnancies
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (includi ng a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject occurring while the 
subject is on study drug, or within [ADDRESS_281652]’s last dose of study drug, are considered 
immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to be discontinued immediately and the subject 
instructed to return any unused portion of the study drug to the investigator(s).  The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the Celgene Safety Monitor 
immediately by [CONTACT_233318].
The female should be referre d to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify the Celgene Safety Monitor of the outcome of the pregnancy as a follow-up to the initial 
SAE report.
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted 
fetus]), the Investigator(s) should follow the pro cedures for reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event 
to the Celgene Safety Monitor by [CONTACT_233319] 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event).
In the case of a live “normal” birth, the Celgene Safety Monitor should be advised by [CONTACT_137809] 24 hours of the Inve stigator’s knowledge of the event.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_281653] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death  after 30 days that the Investigator(s) suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the study dr ug should also be reported to the Celgene Safety 
Monitor by [CONTACT_233319] 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event.
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination regarding the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be determined by [CONTACT_737](s) and the Celgene Medical

Cairo-Bishop Definition of Laboratory Tumor Lysis Syndrome (LTLS)
Uric Acid ≥ 476 μmol/l (≥ 8.0 mg/dl) or 25% increase from baseline
Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/l ( ≥ 6.0 mEq/l) or 25% increase from baseline
Phosphorous ≥1.45 mmol/l  ( ≥ 4.5 mg/dl) or 25 % increase from baseline
Calcium ≤ 1.75 mmol/l ( ≤ 7.0 mg/dl) or 25% decrease from baseline
Laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (LTLS) is defined as either a 25% change or level above or below normal, as 
defined above, for any two or more serum values of uric acid, potassium, phosphate, and calcium within 3 days 
before or 7 days after the initiation of chemotherapy.  This assessment assumes that a patient has or will receive 
adequate hydration (± alkalinization) and a hypouricaemic agent(s).

From Pretreatment value (%)Absolute neutrophil count/ μLd (nadir)
0 No change to 10% ≥ 2,000
1 11% - 24% ≥1,500 and < 2,000
2 25% - 49% ≥1,000 and < 1,500
3 50% - 74% ≥ 500 and < 1,000
4 ≥ 75% < 500
a.Grades: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; 4, life-threatening; 5, fatal.  Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any 
level of decrease from pretreatment will be recorded as grade 5.
b. Platelet counts must be below normal levels for grades 1-4.  If, at any level of decrease the platelet count is 
<20,000/μL, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, unless a severe or life-threatening decrease in the initial 
platelet count (e.g., 20,000/ μL) was present pretreatment, in which case the patient is not evaluable for toxicity 
referable to platelet counts.
c.Hb levels must be below normal levels for grades 1-4.  Baseline and subsequent Hb determinations must be 
performed before any given transfusions.  The use of erythropoietin is irrelevant for the grading of toxicity, but should be documented.
d. If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches less than 1,000/ μL, it should be judged to be grade 3 toxicity. 
Other decreases in the white blood cell count, or in circulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a decrease in the white blood cell count is a desired therapeutic end point.  A gradual decrease in granulocytes is not a reliable index in CLL for stepwise grading of toxicity.  If the ANC was less than 1,000/ μL prior to therapy, the 
patient is not evaluable for toxicity referable to the ANC.  The use of G-CSF is irrelevant for the grading toxicity, 
but should be documented.

21.6.1. Rai staging system (modified) ( Rai, 1987 )
Low-risk disease Lymphocytosis with leukemia cells in the blood and/or marrow 
(lymphoid cells > 30%)
Intermediate risk disease Lym phocytosis, enlarged nodes in any site, and splenomegaly 
and/or hepatomegaly (lymph nodes being palpable or not)
High risk disease Disease-related anemia (as defined by [CONTACT_233321] 11 g/dl or thrombocytopenia (as defined by [CONTACT_233322] 100 x 109/ L)
21.6.2. Binet staging system ( Binet, 1981 )
Staging is based on the number of involved areas, as defined by [CONTACT_233323] > 1 cm in diameter or organomegaly, and on whether there is anemia or 
thrombocytopenia.
Area of involvement considered for staging:
1. Head and neck, including the Waldeyer ring (this counts as one area, even if more than 
one group of nodes is enlarged)
2. Axillae (involvement of both axillae counts as one area)3. Groins, including superficial femorals (involvement of both groins counts as one area)
4. Palpable spleen 
5. Palpable liver (clinically enlarged)
Stage A Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL and platelets ≥ 100 x 10
9/L and up to two of the 
above areas involved
Stage B Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL and platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L and organomegaly 
greater than that defined for stage A (i.e. three or more areas of nodal or 
organ enlargement)
Stage C Hemoglobin < 10 g/dL and/or platelet count < 100 x 109/L, irrespective of 
organomegaly

Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) 
for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).
Counseling
For a female of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following 
are met (i.e., all females of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following 
risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy): 
!She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child
!She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks 
before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment, dose interruption and 28 days after the end of study treatment
!She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures
!She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the 
need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy
!She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug is 
dispensed following a negative pregnancy test
!She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the 
frequency outlined in this protocol (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
!She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide
The investigator must ensure that for females of childbearing potential:
!Complies with the conditions for pr egnancy risk minimization, including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding

Traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen.  Male patients taking lenalidomide must meet 
the following conditions (i.e., all males must be counseled concerning the following risks and 
requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):
!Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
female or female of childbearing potential
!Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if 
engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or female of childbearing potential.  
Contraception
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to pr actice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
contact [CONTACT_233324]: 1) for at least 28 days before 
starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 
[ADDRESS_281662] include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following ar e examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:  
!Highly effective methods:
#Intrauterine device (IUD)
#Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-[ADDRESS_281667] important information I should know about lenalidomide?
1. Lenalidomide may cause birth defects (deformed babies) or death of an 
unborn baby. Lenalidomide is similar to the medicine thalidomide. It is known 
that thalidomide causes life-threatening birt h defects. Lenalidomide has not been 
tested in pregnant women but may also cause birth defects. Findings from a 
monkey study indicate that lenalidomide caused birth defects in the offspring of 
female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy .
If you are a female who is able to become pregnant:
!Do not take study drug if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant
!You must practice complete abstinence or use two reliable, separate forms of 
effective birth contract at the same time:
!for 28 days before starting study drug

Lenalidomide (CC-5013)
Summary of Changes CC-5013-CLL-[ADDRESS_281673] for the patients that remain on study drug.
The key change in this protocol amendment is to change the study drug packaging from blister 
cards with matching placebo capsules to bottles.  This will reduce the number of capsulespatients are required to take each day.
The amendment further clarifies that patients cu rrently on study drug may remain on study drug, 
beyond the 80% event milestone, until final co mpletion of the study at which time they may 
transition to non-study lenalidomide.  The transition will be at the discretion of the site primary 
investigator and any local regulations.
Significant changes included in this prot ocol amendment #6 are summarized below:
!IVRS will be discontinued for this protocol.  Sites will or der study drug when needed 
through Celgene investigational drug dispensing program.  This will permit sites to order 
study drug only when needed rather than maintain a stock of study drug for the IVRS to 
allocate.  The change is possible at this time since few patients remain on study drug and the study drug is no longer blinded.  
!Removed the 1.25-mg dose level and app lied corresponding changes in the Dose 
Reduction Steps for Lenalidomide (Table 6) as no patients utilize this dose level.
!As all subjects are beyond the risk for TLS, Celgene will no l onger provide allopurinol 
supply for site outside of North America.
!Remove lymph node biopsy and fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_233257].
!Remove additional PK sample collection.  PK samples were drawn at study day [ADDRESS_281674] patient randomized was 2012, further dose escalations are not anticipated and hence no further PK samples.  This will permit the final analysis and 
reporting of this exploratory endpoint at this time.
!Remove the requirement to submit blood sa mples (hematology, chemistry, thyroid 
hormone,  MRD ), urine (urinalysis) and bone marrow 
(biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) samples to central lab for analysis.  Local labs w ill continue to be 
collected in this protocol.  The purpose of this change is to simplify the protocol procedures in effort to reduce the workload for the site personnel.
!   Tumor flare 
events are anticipated at the start of study drug administration.  Since the last patient randomized was 2012, additional events of tumor flare are not anticipated.  The purpose of this change is to simplify the protocol procedures in effort to reduce the workload for 
the site personnel.
!Remove the text for blinding and emergency unblinding activities as the protocol is 
unblinded.

Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Increased the sample size and required that following the enrollment of [ADDRESS_281675] samples.  Enrollment will be extended to only those subjects who agree to 
participate in the PK sub-study. 
!Clarify that the second primary malignancy assessment should be completed during 
the progression free survival follow up phase and the survival phase
Clarified that the assessment for second primary malignancy should be completed during 
the 28-day follow up visits for all patients that discontinue the treatment phase for 
reasons other than progression of disease or withdraw of consent.  
Additionally, the assessment for second primary malignancy should be completed for all 
subjects in the survival phase regardless of the reason for study discontinuation.  These 
assessments were already included in Amendment 4 (but not specified in each sentence that mentioned the respective follow up).  
!Clarify the schedule for the baseline bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_233258].  The bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_233259].  The results are not specifically part of the inclusion exclusion criteria.  This change is being implemented to avoid unnecessary sampling for a subject who may 
eventually fail screening and not enter the study.  
!Expanded exclusion criteria surrounding history of prior malignancies from [ADDRESS_281676] a history of 
malignancies within the 5 years prior to starting the trial.
